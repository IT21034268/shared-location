3,colors,was not what I was looking for. but I will keep it and look it over one day. not my best book.
3,Short,Really thought this book would be way more in depth. It was only about a page on each of the main colors and didn't really expose anything more than could be found just browsing online. Pretty disappointing and not written by Edgar Cacye at all...just pulled from random things he said over the years during readings and compiled into short paragraphs. Not really worth the purchase.
3,casey's book on aura,little book written by casey while awake; describes his experiences during his waking life when he saw auras; his sleeping stuff is more interesting
3,Auras: An Essay on the Meaning of Colors,"For someone that doesn't know anything in this area it may be a nice starter booklet. It is very small, and not really a book at all. For myself it didn't help much as it did not contain much information that I didn't already have."
3,A good starter book,"For those beginning to see the colors of the aura this book is helpful, but lacking in some ways. It actually resembles a pamphlet more than a book, but it is worth the price.Cayce gives the reader a guide to what each aura color suggests about a person's personality based on his own personal observations. If you trust the word of Edgar Cayce, then this is a good book for reference as it is more consistent than some of the other books on auras out there. However, it is a very general guide. Cayce leaves a good bit of room for personal interpretation which can be both advantageous and frustrating."
3,not much information,"This is a very thin tiny book and doesn't contain much information. This book is for people who just want to know something about auras. Though Edgar Cayce can see auras, he's not really good in interpreting them. He has limited knowledge in this area."
4,Similar to professional one,Looks similar to professional one used by sales people in seafood section of Whole Foods.Works much better than a regular knife or potato peeler as far as scaling is concerned.For big fish a bigger one will be better but for a medium-size fish it's good.[...]
5,Great tool,This is a great little tool. It strips scales quickly and cleans up easily. Its much smaller than I anticipated but I happily recommend this product.
2,Choose a different product,The teeth of the scaler are dull. It is not very practical. I would rather pay a few extra bucks and buy something that would do the job. I would not recommend it.
3,"Lots of Potential, and Well Polished","This reference is a nice piece, although to me, it falls a bit short of Sol Taylor's Complete Guide to the Lincoln Cent. The book has very good photographic reproduction, and has some interesting information on die varieties and RPMs. It also reveals a lot about some key issues such as the 1909S VDB and 1922 Plain!So where does it fall short? To me, it reads a little too much like a reference. Aside from a few key dates, many of the date listings give very little information on the quality of the coins produced for that issue. This is where Taylor's book seems better suited, as it very often describes the colors, die states, and strikes of virtually every issue.If this is addressed in later editions, than I think this title holds the potential to really achieve a legacy among Lincoln Cent collectors!"
5,It's just wonderful!,"Being the devoted Connie Smith fan that I am, I had to have this cd. The vocal combination of Connie, along with Sharon White and Barbara Fairchild is heavenly. They harmonize beautifully. With Ricky Skaggs producing, it is perfection. The songs are encouraging, and uplifting. Great vocals, great music, great songs. I've nearly worn my cd out!"
5,inspiring and encouraging,"I read this book before ordering it for a friend who has cancer, because I wanted to make sure it was the kind of information she needed. I thought it was absolutely wonderful. I'm a hard-science kind of person, not skeptical at all about the mind-body connection but definitely needing proof, and I got it here. I can't imagine a person with cancer--especially one with a poor prognosis but who's determined to do her or his best to get well again--who wouldn't feel better after reading this book."
5,Hope,"Here is a book to come back to time and time again... as I have. In the midst of my own cancer journey, I have made it a point to read and re-read portions of this book. In the darkness and uncertainty that accompanies Cancer, this book gave me hope. A guiding light, on a sometimes starless night. My dog-eared copy of this book will forever maintain a cherished place on my bookshelf."
3,dr. recommended,My husband's doctor recommended this as a good read but we felt it was too clinical; hard to get into.
4,An Encouraging Book about Surviving Cancer and other serious illnesses,This book has been in print for several years. Well written and encouraging for those facing serious illness. Would be great if updated and re-printed.
5,Good Fights,The series of fights in this series is of good quality. The time limit is now 10 minutes rather than 30 so the boring fights are a thing of the past.
2,A Must have for Collectors but not for Casual Fans,"UFC 9 is the weakest outing for the UFC at a time when they were facing mounting financial and political problems. Those political problems actually led to this being a horrible event. The Detroit government were considering banning the event even the week it took place. In an effort to avoid having to cancel the event the UFC agreed to only open handed striking (closed fists were a violation of the rules and actually the law).The main event has been dubbed ""The Dance in Detroit"" as Dan Severn and Ken Shamrock squared off in the last SuperFight title match (the winner was placed against Mark Coleman to become the first HW title holder in the UFC). But for most of the fight the two seemed scarred to engage and they circled endlessly before any action happened.The undercard featured Don Frye, Gary Goodridge, Mark Schultz, Cal Worsham, and Zane Frazier. But it is hard for that action to erase the memory of the main event."
2,Doesn't stick like it should.,"Even when following instructions to clean the surface before applying, this tape would not stick as it was supposed to especially on vertical surfaces. It even had the tendancy to buck up on flat surfaces because of the natural curl the tape had gotten from its packaging. Ordered 4 rolls and three of them had this problem. Threw the fourth roll away."
1,No,"I got this to help seal around a small window A/C in my bedroom. I followed the directions when applying it, but was very disappointed. It did not stick or stay in place, and I ended up removing it and throwing it away. I would not recommend this product."
1,Will not stay put!,"The adhesive on this product is not strong enough to keep it in place on my windows. I will try it on a door just so it doesn't go to waste, but I need to find something for these windows!"
2,Doesn't stick,It doesn't stick very well to the frame. It is almost like a static attachment to the frame versus an adhesive connection.
5,Wonderful tape,This tape works great for extra insulation around the air conditioner I recently installed. It also works great as an insular around windows in the winter time. I highly recommend this product. It works well and you get your moneys worth!
4,Nice carving set for yourself or as a gift,"I originally bought this set as a gift, but when I received it I was reluctant to give it up because it looked so nice. The carving fork and knife are presented in a very attractive storage case. Although not as heavy as I had hoped by looking at the shipping weight, they aren't exactly what I would call lightweight. I've since used them on a turkey, ham and prime rib without any problems and actually received compliments when I pulled out the case to carve. I do hand wash these and dry thoroughly before placing them back into their case for storage.Because this item qualifies for Amazons 4-for-3 promotion I would definitely recommend taking advantage of it if you choose to buy this set. Also due to price fluctuations it might be good to keep an eye on it before hitting that buy button. (I paid about half the currently listed price) In the end I decided to order a second one and my father-in-law was very happy with his gift."
4,Hidden Gem,SilverGlass is the first book in a series of four books of the same name. It is the story of the noblewoman/sorceress Nyctasia and her swordswoman/companion Corson. Nyctasia is forced into exile from her city of Rhostshyl for trying to make peace between the ruling families. She hires Corson as a bodygaurd while she travels to mystical forest in the search of her lost lover. A good book that is a good start to an intriguing series. While short(186 pages) it packs in more story than many 300+ page books.
5,Word Pro Works Fine With 7,"I've used Word Pro since it first appeared as Lotus Ami Pro, back in the Windows 3.X era, probably the first or nearly the first GUI word processor for PCs. I wanted to continue using it on my new Windows 7 computer. I installed it from IBM's 9.8 version (the version sold by Amazon here), and it works fine. I don't know about other components in the suite. I checked IBM's website, and Smart Suite is offered for around $350, but no version number or compatability info was provided. I have no idea how IBM's current version compares to 9.8, now about 10 years old. But I don't care that much -- the word processor in 9.8 does everything I need."
1,Does not work on Windows 7,I was misled by the description of the product. They indicated that it would operate on Windows 7which is not the case at all. So now i have a product i cannot use. I guess this is a warming toanyone to read the fine print really well and a reference to an operating system is not a guaranteethat it will work on that system. Live and learn.
5,Collector's Item,"This triple CD is a wonderful compilation of Cole Porter's songs, a MUST for any collector of Cole Porter's music. The producers have been brilliant in compiling variations of songs done throughout the years and one can compare the original songs rendered by Cole Porter himself or Ethel Merman among others in its original version and then go for the more modern sophisticated versions with better sound equipment. The comparisons are often delightful and undoubtedly ingenious. I highly recommend it."
3,Had potential if not for all the errors...,"I agree with others who say they wish they had reviewed this book prior to buying it - it would be a great book and exactly what I was looking for if not for all the errors! It makes it hard to get an accurate assessment of how you are doing on each section. Other than the errors, it would have been perfect."
2,Not for Medium-Advanced test takers( 650 +),"This book maybe of help to those looking to review high school math, but it is utterly useless for those who already have scores above 650 and want to improve.There are many test questions, but very few are similar to the 'tricky' questions found on the GRE. For those I found Barrons, and Kaplan, to be excellent.So if you're an above average test-taker give this book a pass w/o worries."
1,"Passable review, error-riddled, bad information display","Working through this book was a thoroughly frustrating experience. I kept finding my faith in my math skills (which are actually pretty strong, I just wanted a quick refresher) being tested. When I came up with ""wrong"" answers, I determined that most of the time it was because the question had been changed in the answer section (addition turned to subtraction, variables given values, etc.)The concept reviews weren't bad, but suffered greatly from layout -- information, including algebraic statements, were laid out in paragraph form, where they would have been clearer if the logic were laid out in separate lines. The reviews weren't thorough enough warrant the awful layout, and many times the review questions referenced skills that hadn't been introduced yet; sometimes those skills weren't introduced until 2 sections later.Don't waste your money on this book, there are far better GMAT/GRE math review books out there."
3,Useful and concise but full of errors.,"I totally agree with the above rating (and oddly enough we're writing these reviews a day apart, have similar names and are both librarians/headed to library school. Strange.)The information is well presented and useful. It's been a great refresher and I'm sure that this has helped me. However, it is truly full of mistakes, which at first confused me (I thought I was doing something wrong) and is now just frustrating. Page 83 isn't even complete! The bottom of the page cuts off without even giving an answer. Generally, the mistakes are simple and obvious so it's not too disruptive, but it interrupts the process nonetheless.I am about to begin the algebra chapter and, as the previous reviewer has stated, if it gets any worse I don't think I will be able to continue with the book."
1,This book is full of errors! Save your money!!!,"I REALLY wish I had reviews of this book before purchasing it. I am not good at math. I am planning on taking the GMAT so I purchased this thinking it would be a refresher of what I have forgotten since high school and college. I am only on page 29 and have already found two errors. And it leaves me wondering about what errors I HAVEN'T caught. And the errors are so stupid (again, I'm bad at math and if I caught them believe me - they are REALLY obvious). I'm sure there must be more of them... I am so annoyed that I've wasted my time even doing any of this and am on my way (as soon as I'm done writing this review) back to the store to get my money back! Grrrr!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!,Either Dr. Robert E. Moyer is the worst math professor in existence or he's the laziest and probably a mix of both. How can one study of the book we purchase has errors???!!! What a disgrace to the field of mathmatics. In fact let me quantity this for you... there is 99.999999 percent chance out of 100 that professor Moyer can't understand what I just said.
1,Save your money....,"Amazingly poorly edited. There are so many mistakes and misprints I can't believe it made it past the publisher. I'm no mathematician, but all you have to do is look at some of the stuff and you can see blatant, uncomplicated and obvious errors. I can't express my frustration at attempting to use this book. Save your money.... find something else."
1,"Ugh, sick that I spent money on this","As everyone else has said, the book is chock full of errors. Almost to the point one wonders if anyone took the time to edit. STAY AWAY!!!!!"
3,It's not too bad,"Yes, it is true, this book has many simple errors. However, the great number of practice examples offered in this book makes up for many of the simple errors. Plus, most of the errors in this book should not fool even the most deficient of math students. I believe that those planning to take the gre or gmat should not put of buying this book."
1,So many errors...,"I have to say that on a basic level this book definitely refreshed basic math skills that I had forgotten. However, the errors prevalent through the book made me doubt myself greatly. I liked how the lessons were structured so I could get a step-by-step course, but again, after so many errors, it was hard to determine what I was getting correct in the end. If I'd have known earlier and had more time to get a new book, I would have. Do more research than I did and save yourself the worry and doubt, along with whatever money you'd planned to waste on this book."
3,Cole sings Porter,"This CD features demos of songs from two Cole Porter shows. They feature Cole Porter himself singing and playing piano with no other instruments. The sound quality is not great, but it is listenable. It sounds like scratchy old records, which it is actually what it was recorded from. Cole sings his songs in a effete voice, he is a decent but unexciting singer. The only well known song here is ""I Love Paris"", which is from Can-Can. The rest of the songs fromCan-Canfeature Cole's usual clever wordplay. There are also five songs that were written for Can-Can, but didn't make it into the show. The songs from Jubilee don't include the biggest hit from the show, ""Begin the Beguine"". The Jubilee songs aren't as clever as the the Can-Can songs, but they are still better than most songs by other songwriters. I would recommend this CD for hardcore Cole Porter fans only. There are better recordings of these songs by better singers with better orchestration."
4,My Favorite Cole Porter Recording,"This CD features demo recordings of Cole Porter singing his own songs and accompanying himself on piano. His distinctive and somewhat nasal voice has much more character than a typical music theater singer. I have a box set of Cole Porter songs by other singers, but I never listen to it; it's just not as interesting or intimate as these renditions by the composer himself."
1,One star is too many.,"This is nothing more than a list of ways to scam returns that you're not entitled to. One star was as low as I could rate this, so I wasn't able to give it the rating it truly deserves."
1,"Returns is a PRIVILEGE, not a right!","This book is nothing more than scammers on parade. They seriously think that they have an excuse for intimidating others to get what they want? There's a name for people like that...bullies. The ability to return merchandise you aren't happy with is a privilege, it is NOT a right. I strongly encourage people to not buy this book as it just encourages bad behavior and makes life harder for people who work retail who are just doing their job."
3,"""The Making Of Lemmy"" section does not play on my blu-ray players.","I have purchased 2 copies of the Lemmy blu-ray. The ""Making of Lemmy"" bonus section either doesn't cue at all or skips with a blurry picture. I tried both copies on three different blu-ray players all of which have up-to-date firmware. This is only happening on the ""Making of Lemmy"" bonus section. Is anyone else having this issue? Based on the other content, I give this video 5-plus stars."
5,Get it!,It includes footage from Nashville 2009 (2010?) which I actually attended!! The whole thing is great to watch just-so or with your metal head buddies!
3,Nothing special,"The dvd is worth it, because it contains so many extras, including a concert. The documentary isn't that interesting. It seems too planned, and setup."
2,lemmy dvd does not play in dvd players,i just purchased the lemmy dvd only two find out neither disc will play in my dvd player i get an mp3 file message kinda confusing their definately needs two be better quality control put on this item so their wont be any future problems seems two be problems with the blue ray already
4,Rock rocks,"I am not too familiar with rock bands and, as so, approach this movie from a mere consummate point: some information of the Great Rocker supported with rich Extras.Broadening a general knowledge."
4,Spellbinding and haunting,"I read this book as a child when it was first published. I lost it on a camp and can't wait to get my hands on it again. Many of the stories are eerie and others light hearted. They include tales of a modern-day zombie, ghosts in old houses, rock throwing demons, UFO's giving police a hard time, a vampire (in England of all places!) and a large flying ancient bird. The stories have stuck with me all these years and some of them gave me the creeps!! Well worth a read, but not at night!!"
5,Culinary Queen,"I bought this set after having a set for years. Hand washing has always been the way to treat a good knife, so that didn't bother me. I own several expensive sets that I am not nearly as happy with. I see no dark spots, and if I had found the block defective, I would have returned it. These are good for me and good for wedding presents and other gift ideas. These knives, like all the other knives in my possession, need care. You can't buy a shiny new car and scrub the paint with a wire pad, and you can't ignore the care of these knives unless you want them to be dull. If you follow the care directions you should be very happy with these knives for years to come. Enjoy!"
1,Crap,The Block is of very poor quality and is Damaged and put together very poorly. I do not recomend buying this product. I expected much more from Chicago Cutlery.I am very disappointed. I Thought the knives would cut like a knife through warm butter. Well that is not happening.
4,"Nice, inexpensive, sharp set!","I purchased the set from another store while it was on sale. This was my first ""expensive"" knife set and didn't want to spend too much. I think it is a good deal for the $100 range. I've only had for a month and it is working great so far. The blades are super sharp and they look really cool. I think some reviewers consider them ""cheap"" because they don't weigh much, especially the steak knives. They are well balanced though and sure get the job done. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good starter set or who doesn't cook too much. Be sure to hand wash only. As long as you get in the habit of cleaning them after each use and sharpening them from time to time, this set should last a very long time. Cheers!"
3,Stainless - to a point.,"Very nice set of knives but DO NOT wash in the dishwasher. Ours rusted after a few washes then the company told us that they're not made to withstand the heat of a dishwasher. Very dissappointing.Other than the bits of rust, the knives are very nice and very sharp!"
2,"Pretty, sharp, but don't wash em'","They were great, until I washed them. Now they have little brown spots all over them. It looks like rust to me. Since you kind of need to wash your knives now and again, I would say to avoid these. Unless you're looking for a good, rusty knife, then they're the tops."
1,Do not buy!,"After revewing knife sets and checking CR recommendations I decided to purchase this set. CR said that Chicago cutlery was the way to go if you do not want to spend a small fortune on knifes that were still of decent quality.This is the first time I buy something that did not have a review and the first time I write a review because I was so upset with the quality. The knife are not sharp, and they rust - and the block is cumbersome and the inserts that hold the knifes come out - it was actually missing one when it arrived.I hastened to open it and set it up before I noticed, otherwise, if I still had the box, I would have returned it."
2,Rusty and flaking away.,"I spent a small fortune on this knife set shortly after I got married. The first set I purchased, I opened the box and one knife was broken in half and the handle was smashed so I exchanged it but should have learned my lesson. The cheap set of knives I bought in college at Wal-Mart are better quality than these. They are sharp and yes they look nice but they rust, big time! I hand wash and dry right away, they never sit in water and i've even tried sharpening them to get rid of the source of rust but it just keeps coming back. Im almost embarrassed to have these things sitting on my counter and i'm sure by next year, they'll be need to be replaced because they are flaking away. At one point I contacted Chicago Cutlery because there is a warranty and I never heard back from them, since then they have removed any way to contact the company, so much for the warranty! I will never buy Chicago Cutlery again."
4,Excellent value,Just got the set and I'm really impressed. They have a good weight and balance and seem well made. I've seen a few reviews that complain about water/rust spots after diswashing. These knives are hand wash only! The manual was very clear that they were't dishwasher safe. Should be the last set of knives I buy!Great product!
1,Beware quality of his set,"We have been using this set for 3 months. The knives look nice, however the blades are rusting. any contact with still water, even for a few minutes (like in the kitchen sink, and even in the dishwasher) will result in little ""dots"" of rust showing up on the blades. i am going to try to return the set, even though i bought them 4 to 5 months ago."
4,Very happy with this set,"I got this set at a great price and am very happy with it. I haven't had any problems with the inserts coming loose. The knives seems to be of good quality and I use them all the time. I made sure to keep them out of the dishwasher, after reading of previous users having had problems with rust. Like any quality knife set, the proper care is essential to getting the most out what you pay for. I've made the mistake of letting these sit in the sink after use for too long, where the damp has caused small spots of rust on one or two knives. But 99% of the time I wash these as soon as I'm finished with them and dry right away with a clean cloth and have not seen a problem. I love that it comes with the sharperner-- the only thing that would make this the perfect set is if it came with scissors too."
3,Not a toaster,"This oven is great for quick meals utilizing the convection feature. However, don't think that you can use this to make a quick piece of toast. The cleanup is simple; my favorite thing is that my kitchen stays much cooler by not having to start up my gas oven."
3,oven,Not crazy about this item but not easy to find the size I needed. Selection was not large for the features needed. kind of confusing to operate but has performed fine so far.
4,NIceeeeee,"It was alright, I don't really need the book, just for the class. Its alright though, some nude in it and weird pictures in it but thats it. Rated R I think"
4,The Photography Book,"great book, great photosI like how the book it self was big so I can see the pictures well, but the book being big made it also bulky and heavy"
4,Not for the Timid,"Very well done book. It follows the same format as the much-loved ""The Art Book"", in which the art is displayed alphabetically, by the artist's last name. This book also has the photographs listed by the photographer's last name, alphabetically. The only reason I gave it a 4-star grade is that I wanted people to really think about whether this is an appropriate book for their particular household. It has several very ""in-your-face"" photos. For example, right away on page 10 is the famous photo of a Viet Cong prisoner having his brains blown out. And there is a lot of nudity. I am not prudish, but the photos of people who had just been assassinated were difficult to see. Once you have turned the page, you can't ""un-see"" it. However, it is an excellent book, a real landmark of the most famous photos ever done from all over the world."
4,"Good pictures, Poor Writing","The book was fantastic and the pictures were wonderful. The prints are good quality and there is a lot of variety of photographs. The blurbs written by the editor, however, do not adequately interpret the photograph. If you are looking for a source of information on the photographers or particular photos, this book is thumbs down. However, if you want a good collection of really great photographs and prints at a really great price, definitely buy this book."
3,the photography book,The book arrived promptly and was in a little rougher shape than I had expected. The spine was separated and most of the signatures were loose. Still I was hapy to get it.
3,Gift for a friend,My friend is really into photography and does it in his spare time. I bought this as a book for him and I really don't think it was anything like what I expected or him either. It's alright but has more old school pics then contemporary ones.
2,disturbing images,Maybe I have a different taste in photography but I hate this book. It was all depressing black and white pictures. A quarter of the book is of dead people or people being killed. Not the kind of pictures I want to inspire me.
3,watch out the paper back eidition,"First of all, it is a great book! I read it from libary and seached from Amazon afterward.however, the under $10 paper back edition is not the kind I have read in the library. It's a mini edition of the same content. and it makes the letters too small to read comfortably. The pictures in the mini book are fairly ok, but not as good as the hard back edition's.i strongly recommand the hard back edition book but not the paper back. it worths $30+."
4,Indian Country,"This book is a very good overview to the best scenic sights in Northern Arizona. It is a good travel guide as well as being a photographer's guide. I lived in Flagstaff for two years and still learned a lot about scenic sights that I missed from this book. Pick a few places and use the guide to help explore Northern Arizona, one of the most picturesque locations in the world"
1,Do Not Buy From This Company,"I ordered this book as a Christmas present on 9/12/10 and have yet to receive it! Their excuse was ""all out of them in the US so we have to ship it from England""!"
4,For the tired revolutionary,"This is Bob Dylan for late at night. You've just gotten home after a long, pleasent evening and you are tired. You wanna listen to some music. How about Bob Dylan? Nah, don't wanna get to riled up right now...Put on Infidels. It is the 'chillest' Dylan out there (at least that I know of). When you don't want to think (Highway 61 Revisited), don't want to experiment (Another Side of Bob Dylan/Self Potrait) this is great.Three best songs:3: I and I. Very chill, reggae-ish. I'm looking forward to the version on ""Is It Rolling, Bob?"" the Dylan reggae tribute.2. Jokerman. Ultimate relaxation right here. Jokerman dance...1. Neighborhood Bully. A true rocker. The one way this album reminds me of that underappreciated (at least in my opinion) Dylan album Shot of Love is that they both have one song that everyone must agree rocks. ""Neighborhood Bully"" is that song."
3,Mixed feelings about this one...,"I have very mixed feelings about ""Infidels"". I definitely think it is much better than the 2 albums that preceeded it, the painfully mediocre ""Saved"" and ""Shot of Love"" which came after the beautiful ""Slow Train Coming"". The lyrics are here are top-notch, and some of Dylan's best of the 70's. Elegiac, mournful, poetic and ironic in the vein of his best stuff. My main problem here is with the music. Too many of the songs are forgettable and lack interesting melodies and choruses. You listen to it a couple of time and nothing really sticks (except for the masterpiece ""Jokerman""). Definitely will not dissapoint hardcore fans, but I'd recommend ""Real Live"" from 1984 which has Dylan doing a live show with the same band from ""Infidels"" except much better."
3,Average disc that should have been better,It is known that this disc was altered during it's original release 20 years ago.Bob changed the song selection and re-did some of the tracks after Mark Knophler had gone.If you want the real Infidels just burn the CD again with the Infidels out-takes from the Bootleg series Vol 1-3 CD set.You will find these 5 or so tracks finish the disc far better.
3,Geat Look,This shoe has a great look and is very soft. Almost too soft. There is no arch support at all in this shoe. Still a decent wardbrobe extender.
4,Good Shoe,These are a comfortable shoe to just slip on and go. They look great and feel good too. My only complaint is that the front of the show scuffs very easily.
5,A book for anyone with a mind and a heart.,"It's quite simple: The Effort To Fall is a book written excusively for the sensitive, the perceptive, and the intelligent. (Ultimately not a single one of these three qualities can exist in a person without the others, but that is another matter entirely).The only negative opinion I have ever heard about this book was expressed, quite obiously, by someone lacking in all of these qualities.This is to date one of the top works of this and last century. It's nothing short of a crime that more people haven't been exposed to its beauty."
2,PRODUCTO INCOMPLETO,"No he podido leer el libro y nunca podré leerlo completo, puesto que varias de sus páginas se encuentran en blanco.Me costó trabajo encontrar el libro y no podré leerlo. Me pesa tanto que les compraría otro ejemplar, pero nada garantiza que no me llegue con páginas en blanco también."
2,es bueno,este libro es bueno tiene lo basico par ser una persona mas segura mas optimista mas entuciasta creo que vale la pena comprarlo para aquellas personas que necesitan controlar dolores de cabeza de una forma relajada y positiva
5,An Absolute Must,"This book is a must for all water distribution modelers, it gives a good review of the fundamental concepts and provides a common sense approach to understanding the essential of water distribution modeling.Purchasing this book is money well spent; it will act as a continued source of reference."
4,Water Distribution Modeling: una excelente guía,El texto así como el software representan una excelente guía de introducción al mundo del diseño y análisis hidráulico. Ojalá en las universidades tubieran oportunidad de contar con material de esta calidad.Mauricio Niño - Ing. Civil - Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Facultad de Minas)
5,Great reference book for all water system topics!,"This book has served as an excellent reference tool for water distribution system design for me over the past year. It is a great summary of water system terminology and hydraulic theory. The index allows the reader to easily reference any water system topic immaginable in clear, basic terms. Topics have proven to be very practical and applicable to current water system design issues. The many pictures, illustrations and figures have also been helpful in conveying concepts."
5,Hydraulic Water Modeling,"Haestad Methods' Water Distribution Modeling text is very informative and useful. The material presented is in depth yet easy to understand. Not only does the book explain the basics of modeling, but it also provides in depth knowledge on advanced modeling topics. The chapter on Testing Water Distribution Systems was particularily useful in tying the model to actual system performance."
5,Water Distribution Modeling,This textbook is a needed addition to an engineer or students reference material. Written by experts in the water distribution field this book provides straightforward information on the modeling process.
5,A Solid start for a Fluid situation,"The Water Distribution Modeling book is a well thought-out and well written book on the subject. I have used and run other modeling programs, and sometimes, I spent more time trying to figure out how to input the data, and then how to edit the data after questionable model runs. This book starts you off from the basics and explains modeling theory. It further explains how to assemble the model, run, and calibrate the model. All of these are essential if you are to have any confidence in the results. The book is comprehensive.I highly recommend this book."
4,Good Help For Water Modelers,I reviewed most of the book in a day. I thought it was a good overview for what a water modeler should know. I especially like the information about calibration and pipe roughnesses.
1,Excellent Buy for Water Distribution Professionals,"This book (and a Book it is, not just a softcover publication) provides an excellent mix of theory and practice. The theory being comprehensive but without details that would not be of relevance to the practical user, supplemented by lots of practical applications and advice.The use of both American and metric units renders the book equally useful to readers on either side of the Atlantic. Last but not least, the complimentary copy of the academic version of WaterCad allows readers who otherwise do not have personal access to a hydraulic network computer program, to work out the various problems and questions at the end of each chapter at their own pace.In short, a book to be recommended!"
5,Water Distribution Modeling by Haestad Methods,A technical book that is written in a very easy to read manner. The information needed to understand the rationale behind the modeling is presented as well as how to represent physical features in a seamless fashion. This is the best book I've seen on water system modelling.
4,Engineering Library Must-have,"This comprehensive water modeling reference answers the questions that your software's help files do not. Clearly written with plenty of examples, illustrations, photos, and diagrams (even cartoons!), you won't put this book down while you are working on your model.This book has been, and continues to be, extremely helpful as we develop and CALIBRATE our system. The information inside was very practical and applicable to me as an engineer."
5,Four Books In One!,"I am writing to recommend Water Distribution Modeling by Haestad Methods, et al to anyone interested in water distribution modeling or general hydraulics. The book is written clearly and combines useful illustrations with interesting problems. It is a good way for practising engineers to ""brush up"" on hydraulic theory and an easy book to read. With this one book I can replace the 4 other I had to flick through before."
4,Water Distribution Modeling,"I liked the book and reading and following were smooth. This would be a good book for anyone interested in modeling, Haestad or not."
5,REQUIRED READING!,This book provides a great deal of information for engineers and scientists that work with water distribution modeling. This book is extremely useful for all levels of experience. A great tool to use to understand the theories of water distribution and the development of a water distribution model.This book should be required reading for any engineer performing water distribution analysis! A++
4,One of the most useful books in the business,"If you happen to be in the consulting business, this book will help you over and over to get to the optimal solution. I have used it plenty of times, and evry time it gives me a better understanding of the behavior of hydraulic networks.I highly recommend you to try it and convince yourself of the value of it."
5,Good information for professional or student,"I have used this book many times when needing information on water systems, fire design, domestic uses, materials and general overall guidelines. The book is easy to read and seems to be more in tune with every day applications rather than just theory."
5,Water Distribution Modeling,"Water system modeling was presented in a logical an concise manor, End of Story."
5,Water Distribution Modeling bu Haestad,"This book is presented in workbook style from Modeling theory, building model, Calibrating your model and verify the results. The principles and examples were explained well enough to provide a solid grasp of the concept and application. One of the best engineering books.Lionel Sun, PE and MSCESeattle Public Utilities"
5,Water Distribution Modeling,A very complete and thorough address. An excellent reference even if one is not utilizing the accompanying software.
5,Water Distribution Modeling,I have been searching a long time for a book with these resources. It will be quite useful.
3,Water Distribution Modeling,A good book discussion many important facets of Water Distribution Modeling. For in-depth aspects advanced Water Distribution Modeling may be a better choice. Both are written by the formost authorities in the subject. Therefore they are good choices for your reference library.
5,Water Distribution Modeling,A book of this nature has been needed in the water distribution modeling arena since this type of engineering software has been in existence. The book covers from a to z of how to make the modeling software produce results that simulate the true field conditions of water distribution systems. The figures within the book really help illustrate the topics that are being discussed. Great book !!
4,Water Distribution Modeling manule review,"I recently had the opurtunity to spend a few hours reviewing the Haestad Methods ""Water Distribution Modeling"" manual. This book is full of usefull design tools and equations as well as liturature to help the Design Engineer through the process of water distribution design. The book is an invaluable addition to my company library as it is useful for my entire design staff from design technition and draftsmen as well as my most experienced Engineers.David W. Mathews P.EPresidentMathews Engineering, Inc."
5,Water Distribution Modeling,This book is an excellent resource and it can be used to gain professional development hours.
1,What's all the hype about?,"I bought this book because it had a good rating on Amazon. What a waste of money. This book is not that creative and some of the suggestions, my partner and I had to laugh at because they were so stupid and nobody in their right mind would try them. I would recommend this book for older couples who need spice in their sex life (or who are on life support)."
4,Best Best Best means: mono mono mono,"VANGUARD, the oldest (since 1949) and largest independent American classical label, really dug into their archives for THE BEST OF STRAUSS WALTZES. Only Track #1 is stereo. The rest are unadulterated (that is, not rechanneled) monaural dubs.

3,Outdated.,A good book that needs updating. Get the RVer's Bible if you want something more current and more complete.
3,Buy before your RV,"This is a decent book, but it needs to be purchased before you buy an RV. We didn't need the first half because we had already purchased ours when we got the book."
3,"Okay, but not great","This book is good for people who want to know the basics, but it doesn't reveal almost any new tricks or facts for the more seasoned undergrads. There are some good tables and the advice is accurate--but we already knew that (at least those of us who bothered to pay careful attention to the literature we get from clinical programs). The structure of the book and the way it is written is okay, but organization could be better. Overall, it's a good tool to start out with, but only if you're not really sure where or how to start."
5,I Got In!,"Although I was a highly qualified applicant a year ago, I didn't know the real ""tricks"" to getting into a Ph.D. program. Therefore, I was rejected by all 10 programs to which I applied. After finding this book (thank you, thank you, thank you to the authors!) and following its instructions, I have received 3 offers and will begin attending Columbia's clinical psychology program this fall. Hooray!"
3,catchy but dated,axel F still sounds good.most of the songs on here are still very radio friendly which in alot of cases leaves mixed results.still it's a pretty good disc but dated Synths&Drum Machine material.
5,Very provocative,"An extremely well-written and inspiring work, Cooper succeeds in bringing us Beethoven the artist."
3,Good But Not Great,"I have to agree with other reviewers about some of the filming qualities of the various Leonard Cohen concert segments featured on this compilation DVD. Otherwise, it is an absolute treasure to see Leonard Cohen and his back up players and singers in action in different venues. I recommend ""Live in London"" over this DVD if you only want to buy one."
2,"Good sound, awful picture","The picture quality of this BluRay is just horrible, and I'm not talking about the fact that it is 1080i instead of 1080p. The picture is extremely grainy, and panning schenes are lagging a lot, as if they are having trouble with the optical image stabilizer. The image qualty is not even near what you would expect, so if you have to see him, buy the CD/DVD combo instead."
5,This Stuff Kills All The Funk!,"I was a landscaper for a number of years so by 10am I would be sweating through my pants. This as you may have guessed invited all sorts of funky stuff to lurk in my lower regions. I have tried everything - Gold Bond, Mexsana, Monkey Butt, none of it can touch Zeasorb!Within two days the evil is gone, I use a little every day in the summer for maintenance. Zeasorb kills the bad stuff and dosen't have that medicine smell that the gold bond has. The price may be high but IT WORKS 5x better than anything else so it's worth it. I gave some to a few of my friends for Christmas, they thought it was a gag but oddly enough they have all called me asking where I got it. Buy it!"
4,Zeasorb Super Absorbent,This product is good and I feel very easy when I using it and better . Before that I feel very itchy in my body but after I applied this product the itchy were no more. I would recommend to my friend and those who need it .
4,Keeps me dry and sliding,"I've had what might be clinically described as an, ahem, overly sweaty crotch area for the past 30 something years. I started self treating it with corn starch (yes, recommended by Ken Kesey) and baby powder and then the Gold Bond products (regular in winter, extra strengh in summer), which worked just fine as long as I lived in the desert southwest (av. humidity 10%). Soon after I moved to Memphis (av humidity 70%), things went horribly out of control and I found myself in a dermotologists office displaying a truly world class example of (ahem) crotch rot. He said that the Gold Bond products were starch based and the local fungal critters just thrived on starch. Yum. He suggested Zeasorb-AF which has a talc (mineral) base and has really done the trick. Expensive though, at around $8.00 for 2.5 oz at Walgreens. But then, I'll pay anything. Anything."
5,I love this powder!,"I love this powder! I had never heard of it until my doctor mentioned it to me in the summer time due to the tendency to sweat and develop yeast infections under my breasts. I use it all the time now! I just love it! It works great! My only complaint is the cost and the small bottle that the Antifungal one comes in. But, I still love it and use it religiously! Definitely a plus! Difficult to find in grocery and drug stores where I live for some reason though!"
2,Mrs,I ordered Zeasorb-AF and received Zeasorb. I did not return the product because of the time involved. I have always been pleased with my Amazon purchases but this time I did not get what I ordered.
1,Snare shifts off the drain,"This item works perfectly as long as it remains in position. Unfortunately, the rim is not weighted. So it does not stay in place. Inevitably, as the shower progresses, the snare shifts off center, and hair flows right down the drain. An additional problem arises from one's family, because they fail to place it on center. I will next try out the metal strainers, that are inserted in the drain."
2,Not worth it,"The tub fills up with water faster with this drain cover on than it does if the drain is clogged with hair. It is not worth buying this to keep the hair out of the drain, because its purpose is defeated as the tub fills with water anyway. The one plus is that it sticks to the tub floor pretty well and doesn't move off the drain."
4,Not bad at all.,The quality is pretty good on this CD also. Im a very serious singer and am very picky about my music because the timing is everything in the music when you do not use the teleprompter for your words. I recommend this CD to anyone who does sing Madonna.
1,A terrible work that should be retired!!!,"This book has an excellent title - makes you think that it is a good reference. Right? Wrong! This book takes ""basic"" to a new level. I have never seen a reference book as simplistic and amateurish as this. It is obvious in many of the descriptions and pictures that the instructors were making up stuff as they went along. I am a kubodo instructor for a martial arts school in Colorado Springs and I was trying to find something that my students could use as a reference. This was definitely not the book. My white belts in their beginner classes could come up with more professional moves than this. This book was printed in a decade were the hype surrounding martial arts made unscrupulous people ""professionals"" in an underhanded way to make a quick buck. It is obvious that this is one of those cases."
2,Basic Reveiw,"The book is a basic manual on weapons. The book starts off strong with very good techniques with the knife (with the exception of attacking with them.) Mainly the self-defense applications. Dr. Gambordella coverage of the yawara, tonfa ad Jo is adequate. But his coverage from there on shows poor technique. From the basics of how to hold the nunchaku, Bo or sai are wrong.If you where to hold the sai as is shown in combat or kumite, you would break your fingers. It appears that Dr. Gambordella is self taught with these last three weapons and has no practical experience."
4,Great Protective Wear,"My daughter is still a little two small to use all of the gear that was included. The wrist braces overlapped the elbow guards. However, she uses the pads mainly for bike riding, and the protection has given her a little more self confidence knowing that if she falls she will not scrape her elbows or knees (especially since these are the most common areas to get injured.) She also doubles the use and has started using them to learn how to rollerblade.... She absolutely loves them since they are ""Barbie"" and are very pretty too!"
5,Amazing Talent & Energy!,"We went to a George Strait concert and Dierks Bentley broke out! Incredible energy and a stellar performance! He was awesome! Immediately bought the cd and can't get enough! If you get the chance to see him perform, don't miss it...if he isn't scheduled to be in your area soon, buy his music...this is one of those artists you'll be proud to say, ""I was listening to this guy when...."""
5,A Rising Superstar,"Dierks Bentley's self-titeled second album (he released ""Don't Leave Me In Love"" sometime earlier) is by far one of the best country cd's of the year. Along with Brad Paisley's ""Mud on the Tires,"" I would have to rate Dierks album one of my favorites for this year. His debut single ""What was I thinking"" has soared to the top of the country music charts, and I particularly love the second track off of his new cd, ""Wish it would break."" ""My Last Name,"" ""I Can Only Think of One,"" and ""My Love Will Follow You,"" could all become hit singles on the country charts. While those are my personal favorites, the entire cd is excellent, and it is one of the rare few, in these days, that you can actually let play from beginning to end. All in all, this cd is well worth the money."
5,great CD great LIVE BAND,"this cd is great!!!! about a week ago, i got the chance to see dierks live for the first time. he is a great musician with an awesome band. his show is full of energy, fun and amazing talent from dierks and the men that stand behind him.i strongly recomment this cd and if any of you get the chance, go see his live show. these men are very talented!!!!!"
5,Reason for being top new artist,"There's a reason Dierks Bentley won the ACM Award for Best New Artist. His hit single ""What Was I Thinkin'?"" just tops off a CD of great ""drinkin' and cheatin' songs""-- the way country music is supposed to be. ""Bartenders, etc."" is a good ol' honky tonkin' song. ""Forget About You"" can speak to just about any broken heart. What is also impressive is that Bentley wrote 11 of the 13 tracks on the CD himself. Dierks Bentley has earned every bit of fame and deserves even more. This is one of the best country music CDs you could ever buy."
5,Dierks is on Fire!,"The way he slides his voice around a note that makes me shiver; the surprising melodic riffs that cause me to smile; the fluidity with which the instruments harmonize. And, as you might expect from an artist that gives you all that, the lyrics are poetic and poignant. Country? Very. Routine? Never. Tired? Not on your life. It's alive, fresh, unique, stimulating. Dierks is a stand-out new artist who has given us a CD full of gorgeous songs, none of which misses the mark. Play as foreground or background music. It is highly relatable and pleasantly listenable. I will have it worn out before his next one comes along, so Hurry, Dierks; you've somehow left me satisfied, yet hungry for more. It doesn't get any better than that!"
3,Like the gel caps but hate taking so many,This is a nice product but I did not know I had to take four of them to get the supplement amount they advertised. I would prefer to only take one or two.
4,doesn't everyone need these?,"Unless you have a body made perfect for nursing and never get sore nipples, you need these or a product like it. You have to get the absorbent pads to put in them though or empty them regularly, if they have free milk in them it sloshes around and you can't bend over or anything because it leaks out the vents holes int he top. But i don't know of any product that serves the same purpose and doesn't do this."
4,wrong picture: the girl's frame color is silver and light blue,"This picture shown is of the boy's frame.On the girl's frame:Instead of yellow there's light blue and instead of black there's silver.This was a really good deal at $80.00. I see now it's gone up to 129.00. Perhaps still an OK deal with free shipping, but at that price,one can get an equal deal at a local store.At $80.00 it's a five star'er. At $129.00, it's maybe a 4 star deal.The fork shock is a bit sticky; add lubricant with teflon. All other components are fine for trail riding, etc."
2,DOES NOT HAVE AUTO TURN OFF,"I bought the bottle warmer as a separate piece. Overall I would not recommend it. It does not have an auto turn off and when you are a new mom and sleep deprived I can assure you will forget to unplug it or switch it off. If you forget to switch it off the water becomes so hot it will evaporate in a very short amount of time.Also beware formula may get extremely hot. Always test it before feeding it to your baby.I do use the Avent bottles and despite the fact I would prefer to use glass instead of plastic, it is almost impossible to find glass bottles with decent nipples. The great thing about the Avent nipples is they do resemble a breast nipple so the transition from breast to bottle was much easier for my daughter. If you are like me and you do not like the idea of warming up the formula in plastic you can get the Evenflo Classic glass bottles, warm your formula in those and then pass it to the Avent bottle when the formula is not very hot."
2,Too Soon..What were you thinking,"It was MUCH too soon to realase another GH package. Heart Attack is one of the most embarrassing songs. If Steve Kipner hadn't just given her Physical he'd be never have gotten this mess past her. Tied Up is a forgotten gem. Written by Lee Ritenouer and John Farrar it shines. But the biggest songs Magic, Physical and Make A Move on Me were 2 years old or less. This was an LP put out strictly for profit. Buy the Australian Import and get 4 more songs (The Promise, Deeper Than The Night, Totally Hot and Landslide)"
1,Don't waste your money on this book,This book isn t any good false info and has some bad remarks on the beatles down with who ever made up this wacked out stuff PEACE Rumplestiltskin
3,Drab presentation of his remastered classics,"Let me state right off the bat that the sound quality of these remastered tunes is fabulous. The music of Buddy Holly has never sounded better to me. That being said I would defintely not recommend this one to collectors. To me the packaging is downright ugly and there are absolutely no liner notes included here. Most of his biggest and best are here but this compilation does not include ""Early In The Morning"" and one of my favorite Buddy Holly songs ""Raining In My Heart"". I'm only guessing but it looks like this might have been the first collection of Buddy Holly that featured remastered tracks. There are much better and more complete options out there now. I would skip this one altogether."
2,Sounds Like The Master Tapes Are Worn Out,"I have original 45 rpm records of some of these songs and they sound better than this CD or any of the other compilations that I have tried. Peggy Sue is the worst - it sounds like all the high frequencies have been lost (except for the guitar break that appears to have been ""souped up""). Holly's voice was a real presence on the original Peggy Sue and is almost background noise on this CD. All of these guys who are ""re-mastering"" need to listen to some of the original vinyl. I think some of these master tapes are worn out."
2,doesn't bust a gust,"Needed a sturdy umbrella for heavy rainstorms. Picked this one because of GustBusters reputation despite cost. Hardly used. Bought in October, died yesterday, May 18, 2011. Will cost $10 for shipping & handling to replace."
2,Great for 6 months,"I really loved this umbrella, but after 6 months it is completely usable. First, the tips frequently popped off & I put them back on. Then, the rope on the handle fell at the off, but it was still usable. Today, two ribs broke and now it is no longer usable and I am very sad; I loved my pink umbrella and now it is gone :(. Hopefully I can get a replacement or refund."
3,Meh,"Bought for Windy-City Commuting wife. Top knob was broken within one week. Hoping warranty replacement will be simple, but really expected more."
2,"Excellent performance, terrible reliability","This is a powerful umbrella. So powerful, that it's slightly difficult to close (it's a manual close unit). It has performed exceedingly well in heavy rainfall with excessive winds (up to 30MPH). However, I only had the opportunity to use it approximately 6 times over a 1 year period, and then it failed to close after opening. The stalk (?) became dislodged from the canopy, and the spring shot out. I was unable to repair it myself, and the company wanted me to pay to ship it there, and send them a check for $10 to return it. So, I'll just order a different umbrella - probably a ShedRain WindPro or Leighton Windefeyer. I see that Amazon only carries the Gustbuster in Pink now, so maybe they've stopped selling these anyway."
4,Not the best,I got the classic 48 inch as well as this metro umbrella to carry around in my backpack. I don't nearly like this one as much as my classic. This has better form factor but I don't plan on carrying around an umbrella 24/7 with me. Comes with a nice plastic sheath for storage/carrying.This has a metal frame and def does not seem that sturdy. Get the 28 inch classic if you want it to last you.I rated it a 4/5 because it is better than any other small form factor umbrella I have ever had.
5,55+ MPH - They Weren't Kidding,"I live in NorCal and today we're having an insane storm with wind gusts ranging from 40-75 MPH. I've already when out a few times today and my GustBuster is holding up beautifully.Not to mention what it's already been through this year alone: San Francisco's rainy season, severe thunderstorms in the Midwest, and those famous London showers. This umbrella delivers.Highly recommended."
5,Gustbuster Umbrella,love the Umbrella what it says in the describe it true and it works and will buy in the future.
5,Sturdy Umbrella,"We found this umbrella in another catalog and immediately thought of looking on AMAZON to see if we could find it for less. We did, and are very pleased with the quality and price we paid for it. Thank you AMAZON. Now I am going to look up something I just saw in a store. I want to get it for less!"
3,GustBuster Metro 43-Inch Automatic Umbrella (Black),"Nicely constructed umbrella, but I thought that it was going to be a little bigger. Good to fit one person and one person only. The handle is rather short and would be better if it had a J-handle."
5,Excellent umbrella,"Canopy is little on the small side but that's a reasonable compromise for a compact folding umbrella. I leave it in my car for short walks in the rain and use my Gustbuster 62"" Doorman for longer walks. Excellent build quality. 43"" is a bit deceptive, since it measures the circumference. I was told by Gustbuster this is the standard for measurement in the industry. Actual size is 36"" across from the tip of the ribs, and 33"" across from the fabric between ribs. Would prefer something like a rubber coated handle for a softer touch (minor quibble). No problems in windy weather."
2,Broke on second use,"Loved this at first. Seemed strong and sturdy. Never had a chance to try it in a gusty rain; the second time I popped it open, the force of the mechanism popped the top off the plastic core. I would have ordered a replacement but was disappointed about that core construction. For the money, I expected something sturdier. People rave about these. Too bad. Went with another brand that's all-metal. Good news was Amazon's pre-paid return mailer and speedy refund."
2,Didn't last one month!,"I purchased the Gust Buster Metro from Amazon and was pleased when it arrived. I wanted an umbrella that could stand up to the tough weather in Maine. I used it four times in the rain - no heavy winds - and then noticed a fiberglass rib snapped off at the plastic rivet, collapsing one portion of the umbrella. There is no fixing it. The umbrella might be good in the wind, although I have not been out in those conditions yet, but I'm getting wet because one side is collapsed and the rib is not pushing the umbrella open as it should. I am not pleased with the Gust Buster Metro. I have written the company and am awaiting an answer to see if the 'lifetime' warranty is honored. I must admit, I didn't think 'lifetime' of use meant one month! There must be better umbrellas in the marketplace."
2,not what I expected,"the umbrella seems sturdy enough, but is smaller than I thought and it advertises pinchless open and close release system, but there is no close release. The advertised ""Sure-grip comfort handle"" is very low quality wood. Disappointing quality for the price."
2,nice umbrella but question quality,"I purchased 2 43"" gust busters because I'd heard good things about the umbrella & wanted something that would not bend back when the wind blew. I used 1 for appx. 3 months & was extremely disappointed when one of the ribs/spokes came apart. This makes me question the quality of the umbrella when it breaks so quickly with minimal use during just 3 months (& there were no major wind gusts to stress it). I am also extremely disappointed in their 'lifetime' warranty. Even with a defective part, I was still required to pay shipping & handling to send them the umbrella PLUS an extra $10 payable to the company to cover THEIR S&H costs. Although they did send me a new umbrella, it bothers me that I have to pay them to have them cover their own 'lifetime' warranty."
2,Looks good but shoddy construction,"OK, we moved to London from LA so we got two umbrellas as presents - the Gust Buster Metro and a small pink one. My wife kept the small pink one which has survived very well. The Gust Buster less so. I'm pretty careful how I treat stuff but this is really badly made. First the shoulder strap popped off, then the wooden (yes wooden!) handle chipped for no reason and now, after 7 months of being used perhaps twice a week, one of the struts disconnected from the little connector pin which enables it to fold. So I've fixed it, sort of, with a paper clip. We're very disappointed with the shoddy construction of the Metro Gust Buster. I emailed them - no answer. Then I called and they were pretty unhelpful. I even asked why they design something these days with a cheap wooden handle - why not use strong plastic?"
5,"a heavy duty, get the job done umbrella",I love this umbrella. It is sturdy and fufills its anti-gusting promise. Would buy again.
5,A perfect umbrella,"We own three of these umbrellas. They are compact and easly to hold, open and close. Their design is perfect for windy and rainy days. I have never had one lose its shape due to a wind gust."
3,Smaller than expected,Umbrella has great specifications and technology but it was a lot smaller than I wanted. Got this as a replacement but it works foe when I need it. The silver handle is actually feels loose - hope it doesn't break. I might end up getting the larger version. My arms and legs still get wet when walking through the rain but at least my head is dry. OK umbrella.
4,"Good Umbrella, Although a Bit Large","Very good, sturdy umbrella, but it doesn't fold up all that small. Will fit in my briefcase, but I got tired of carrying it around with me due to its size."
1,43-inch umbrella is actually 36 inches,"This umbrella isn't anywhere near 43"". By actual measurement it is only 36"" in diameter. I was very disappointed and am returning it. I got one elsewhere that is much larger, automatic up and down and collapses to the same size as this one for about the same price."
2,Not worth the hype,"I bought this after I read a lot of good reviews.Here are some cons:1. Shabby handle. The handle is wooden and resembles an umbrella you get at a dollar store.2. The strap is very small. It is impossible to insert your hand through the strap.3. Very crappy construction of the release mechanism. With the slightest touch, the release button keeps popping off and the umbrella tries to open.4. No auto close. A lot of umbrellas do this. Once the umbrella is open, you press the same button and the umbrella closes. Not this one."
3,Great for the first season,"I purchased this umbrella last winter after researching on Amazon. I live in Southern California, so I don't use my umbrella on a daily basis. I wanted something sturdy that would last more than one season so I wouldn't have to purchase one again. This umbrella was great last winter, it worked as well as everyone reported. However, we had our second rainstorm of the winter in California this week and the umbrella is starting fall to apart. The top nob came off and one of the spokes has separated from the umbrella. I don't think this product was worth the extra money since I am in search of a new one again after only 1 year."
1,Plastic ribs break frequently.,"I have owned several Gustbusters over the past six years. The most recent iteration of the Metro, which I think has been on sale for the past two years, has plastic ribs extending along the inside of the umbrella surface. These ribs are brittle and snap frequently, rendering the umbrella ultimately unusable. Please let me know if you can recommend another vented umbrella, preferably with steel or fiberglass ribs."
2,Quality has plummeted,"The original gustbuster I purchased years ago was bulletproof. It was impervious to Chicago's gusty winds and rain. Sadly, I lost it.The second one i purchased had to be returned for warranty repair b/c the tips kept popping off. I would open the umbrella and have to manually pop them back on. The replacement I received not only has tips popping off, but the arms are coming undone. I've had to McGyver them back on using paperclips or small key rings. I'm sure they'd warranty this one too, but it's not worth the return shipping costs. The cost of returning 2 umbrellas for warranty service = price of a new umbrella.Sad that the quality of this once great product has plummeted."
2,2 Stars is Generous,"In less than a year: Within a month, the handle strap broke off, then the top seam cover. Now 4 months later: 2 arms fell off their tract (not in a big storm, just normal opening) making it now completely useless. Also, the automatic open button is sensitive and would open in my bag all the time, very annoying. Furthermore, 43"" is not going to keep you dry when its raining and windy and a walking commuter. I had high hopes, but this thing didn't keep me dry, didn't last, and does not live up to the other reviews."
2,"Great idea, poor construction","I got a Gustbuster Metro umbrella on a friend's recommendation after my old, cheap $10 umbrella from Walmart took a dive. I received it in great condition and, being from rainy Seattle, was looking forward to getting good use out of this umbrella. After two days of use in almost zero wind (""gusts""), one of the elastic straps holding down the top portion of the umbella became unravelled. I emailed Gustbuster to see if this was covered under their lifetime satisfaction guarantee. They said it was, but I would have to pay to ship it to them, and give them $11 for return shipping. For a $35 umbrella? Uh, thanks but no thanks, I'll just save my $20 bucks and buy another Walmart umbrella like the one that lasted me 5 years! Disappointed."
3,Not what you ordered,"This umbrella is not what it says it is. It is advertised as a 43"" umbrella. It is actually a 33"" inch umbrella. The 43"" measurement is over the curved part. Kind of misleading. No one measures that way."
2,"Warning: ""Warranty"" isn't what they claim...","The product itself isn't bad. It **does** hold up to strong winds, but not the 55mph they claim.First bigger than average gust the staff of the umbrella bent, not by much, but just enough that it's hard to retract now.When I contacted customer care they said that they'll replace it, if I send it back at my own expense AND send them money for shipping. After pricing that it'll cost me more to purchase a new one from Amazon than get my ""Warranty"".You can trust that the money that will go towards a new umbrella will not be going to them."
3,"Strong but a little short, sharp, heavy, and expensive",This umbrella feels very solid but I haven't had the chance to really test it in the wind.It is a little expensive for what you get. It is a little too short and heavy. The metal parts are sharp so it would hurt your hands if you try to hold it tight with two hands in strong winds.
1,non delivery,I cannot rate this item since it has not been delivered yet. I have replied to the email I got confirming my order but have not heard anything yet - not even an undelivered reply. Could someone please tell me what is happening and why I have not received my umbrella?
4,"Good Product, But Don't be Misled!","We travel, and liked the idea of a 43 inch umbrella canopy as opposed to the more standard 36-inch. Surprise, this unit may measure 43-inches along the circumference of the canopy; but, it is still only a 36-inch umbrella. While it seemed well made and sturdy, alas, it did not meet our needs, and was returned. As usual, Amazon was easy to work with on that count."
3,So So,"This umbrella was purchased purely based on size. It was worth it for that alone. However, I am not happy with it's opening and closing system."
3,Maybe,"I would only buy this umbrella if you used it a lot. Occational use this is overkill. Too heavy, too large when closed, not big enough open, and expensive."
5,Gust Buster auto brolly,"This product is constructed to withstand very strong winds which it does perfectly. It is perfectly constructed , nothing very fragile, all the strength of the mechanism gives the user great confidence that it will never blow inside out. The material between the ribs is strengthened perfectly. This umbrella gives great confidence that it will never let you down and can be carried collapsed over the shoulder. A friend borrowed mine and immediately wanted one having had to throw away other fold up types"
5,Great umbrella and just bough my second one,"I was not very bright about a month ago and left this umbrella were I should not have. Oh well, someone else now has a very nice umbrella and I just purchased a replacement. This is a good size umbrella for taking to work and really does hold up very well in the wind. The problem of course is that rain is pushed by wind, so it well not help you from getting wet. Great product!"
3,"Worked well, for about a year","I bought this umbrella after my previous one was destroyed in high winds. For about a year, the umbrella worked very well. However, the plastic cap at the top of the umbrella eventually broke, followed by the thin, wooden handle, causing the button to continually pop out. I never had any issues with the spines, or plastic tips, but having a broken handle sealed the deal for me, and I ended up purchasing a different brand. If they re-engineered this umbrella to use better quality parts - even a plastic/rubber handle - I'd probably give it another shot."
2,bad grip area,"it's too bad that one design flaw makes this otherwise well-built, strong little umbrella an unpleasant thing too use. The grip area is short, and I could even be okay with that, but just above the grip, where a large hand naturally lands, there's a sharp steel latch. Its function is to lock down the closed umbrella. But it doubles as a stabbing tool. There's almost no way to grip around it, and when the wind is blowing it's sure to painfully poke or scrape your index finger or thumb. Too bad, because the gust defeat design is exceptional. In fact I bought their 48"" model afterwards. That non-collapsing design has a smooth U shaped handle, is surprisingly light weight and simply the best umbrella I've ever owned. It doesn't collapse, so getting into cars and stowing it while shopping are inconvenient. Oh well, what are you gonna do?"
3,Quality but small,"Great quality, but very small coverage in a fairly long package. I hoped this would work for me and a child, but it really looks like it will work only for the child. Measurement is deceptive as described by other reviewers."
1,Gust Busted,Pretty much a ditto to all the bad reviews of the GustBuster Metro. I thought it was ideal for what I wanted. Looks good. That's about it. Handle is very flimsy. The ribs break easily if you use the umbrella to block the wind. I have an almost 30-year-old golf umbrella that is MUCH better quality. I read the reviews and the positive reviews outweighed the negative reviews. The people who wrote the positive reviews must have stock in the company.
4,Think about whether you want this.,"I have several of these umbrellas that I leave in cars, and also have given them as gifts. Their main advantage over other portables is the strong construction. That same strong construction though means it is quite heavy, heavy enough that many who I have given them to as gifts also leave them in a car rather than carry them when they walk about, just in case it rains. Don't rely too much on the 'gustbusting' feature. It is nice that the umbrella does not collapse or get destroyed by most winds, but when there are such gusts you are going to get wet from the waist down anyway because the rain gets whipped around. Handle grip is a little short for many hands, but this is typical of portables."
3,"Nice, well made but too small","I found this is too small to work well. Ended up buying a larger folder from Sharper Image that is longer when folded, but works much better at keeping me dry."
1,Poor Quality and Repair Policy,"The umbrella broke in November (less than a year old). A rivet in the canopy broke and the umbrella is out of commission. I emailed the company and they want me to pay $10 shipping and handling to send it back for repair. I refuse to be gouged on shipping and will not have the umbrella repaired. I will purchase a different brand and avoid Gust Buster at all costs as their product could not withstand normal usage.I purchased a new umbrella from Davek Umbrella, New York. I love it! Best umbrella!!!"
1,Absolute Nightmare Umbrella,"I ordered the umbrella for use in college to put in my backpack. The umbrella is way too small to use if your carrying a backpack or briefcase. Also if you are wearing a suit your shoes and pants are going to get very very wet. I does hold up in the wind but the point of an umbrella is to keep you dry. Also the construction is very poor. One star is being a little lenient, half a star is not option for rating, I would have to rate it a half of a star."
1,Nice look but poor quality,"I recently purchased this umbrella from Amazon.com. I was excited to use it the first time - worked great and impressed me with its rain/wind protection. But my happiness was short-lived - during the second storm (heavy rain) - it broke (one of the ""composite"" frames that support the awning) while opening the umbrella! I have just returned the item and have requested a refund. (I do treat my umbrellas with care - my last, and still in use-Wilson golf umbrella has been with me since 1998 and still works great)."
1,Gustbuster doesn't hold up,"After six years of owning a Windbrella, it finally broke when I was hit by a car in Chicago. I read the reviews for the Gustbuster and decided to change brands. Big mistake! I purchased three umbrellas: one for myself and one for each of my children. The first time I used my Gustbuster it broke. Because is was during the holiday season, I returned it to Amazon and it was promptly replaced. Within the first week of using the newer version, it broke at one of the spokes. I contacted Gustbuster, and they agreed to promptly replace it, for a $10 shipping and handling charge! Both of my children's umbrellas have also broken. I will be replacing my Gustbuster with a Windbrella!"
1,Helped with wind - Broken within 4 uses.,"The umbrealla seemed to be easier to walk with in the wind, however, this one I feel did not offer enough protection from the rain. I should have bought the larger one. Now for the bad part. The umbrealla is difficult to close and multiple ribs cracked within the first for times of use. Basically the umbreally lasted a month and now I have to get a new one. I will not be buying this brand."
2,"Good design, but poor, shoddily-constructed materials","I'm not particularly rough with umbrellas -- in the past, I've only had umbrellas damaged in extreme weather. But this GustBuster sustained two broken pieces before it saw its first drop of rain. Before I had even opened the umbrella the first time, the plastic tip on the top had shattered (after withstanding a drop of several inches onto carpet), AND the strap had broken (during normal handling). This was a depressing introduction to a product I had just bought.Actual use of the umbrella is fine, in spite of the hole in the center of the top due to the broken tip. The mechanism works well, although lack of a push-button close is disappointing. Size of the umbrella is as I expected.I feel like I have to be extra-gentle with this umbrella, and I keep wondering what part is going to break next. There are many higher-quality umbrellas out there for a similar price."
3,"Small and Pricy, but otherwise good umbrella","Recently my old umbrella which I got from company I used to work for got snatched away by the little green people so I had to buy a new one.Quick search in amazon best sellers brought me to this one. Have been using it for two weeks in windy streets of new york city and so no complains except of a couple:1) Automatic umbrella in my understanding should also close with button2) It's too small - no nearly enough for two people !3) Handle is very uncomfortable4) For $33 I paid for it I expected a little more ... :(Bottom line - We'll see how it survives next winter, but I won't recommend this one to anyone...Update:Recently I bought Totes Folding Umbrella for $18 - It was I expected from good umbrella: Good handle, BIG size cover yet same folded size, full auto (w/close) and cheap !!!"
3,I expected more from a 30 dollar umbrella,"Pros: protects you from rain, supposedly windproof (haven't tested the windproof yet).Cons: Very poor handle for a 30 dollar umbrella. The handle is too small, which is saying a lot since I am only 5'7''. The umbrella is as big as a normal sized umbrella, and a little bulkier as it is kinda double layered. The material quality doesn't particularly seem like it's any better than a 15 dollar umbrella.Overall, this is a solid medium sized umbrella. Except for the windproof factor, there isn't anything really special about this umbrella, which is disappointing, cause 30 bucks is a lot for a umbrella."
3,Not as expected,"Thought the description said open and close feature, but it opens and is difficult to close (so slipping into a building out of the rain is not an easy task). Also thought it would cover a larger area. It is just small enough to fit inside a backpack, or you can use the straps, so that's good. Haven't yet had the opportunity to test the wind resistance. I have confidence, though!"
2,"For this price, needs to last longer.","Mine broke after two years of intermittent use. A pin dropped out of one of the joints. I think a $30+ umbrella needs to do better than that. Gustbuster wants $10 ""shipping and handling"" to repair it. Is it worth it? How long until another pin drops out? I am disappointed with the quality. It might be better to buy three $10 umbrellas rather than one $30 umbrella, because the expensive one will not last much longer than the cheaper ones..."
1,Handle broke the second time I used it,"The umbrella's handle fell apart the second time I used it.It's too bad, because the canopy of the umbrella seemed to be pretty good. But the handle seemed to be obviously cheap and shoddy to me, before I used it. And then it just fell apart when I did.I don't get where GustBuster is coming from on this. Most people buy super cheap umbrellas on the street while it's raining. But if someone takes the time to look for umbrellas on Amazon, they probably won't really care if an umbrella is $30 or $40. I just wanted something solid. I had a good umbrella that lasted me 12 years, and then I lost it. I wanted to replace it. That's the GustBuster market -- people who take the time to look around, who are willing to pay more, and who want quality.It seems crazy to cut corners on the handle to save a buck. They should build it right and raise the price.Until they do, buyer beware."
2,"Great when it works, but durability is poor","Similar to other users, worked great at first, but had problems with ribs coming out when folded up. Started happening after about 3 months of use, and has gotten worse over time, where almost half of the ribs now detach when the umbrella is folded."
1,Dont Waste your money,I bought this umbrella to help me weather the six month long Caribbean rainy season. Within a few months of purchase the spokes became unhinged and it finally became useless within nine months.Do not waste your money and purchase this item the build and quality is extremely poor!
3,pretty good umbrella,"I've had this for a few months now, and it seems pretty good. Admittedly, I haven't been through a real torrential downpour yet to test out the gust-busting prowess, but for garden-variety rain showers, it works fine. Only concerns thus far are: 1. the coverage area of the canopy is not exactly what I expected (ie, not big enough) given the way it looks in the pictures. 2. not as crucial, but there's something about the feel of the umbrella when unfolded, it feels a little unbalanced, as if maybe a heavier and/or larger handle would help with ballast. Overall, though, it's a solid product. I'm looking forward to a good, strong sideways rain to really see whether those patented tear-drop air flaps get the job done."
2,Expected more from this umbrella,The umbrella itself is ok. I only have two complaints. It's mainly on the handle and the automatic button for the umbrella. I expected the handle to be better made. It looks like it's made out of wood. Water can get into the handle and I didn't expect the handle to be uncomfortable with my small hands. I think the handle is too short. The automatic button opens the umbrella and doesn't automatic closes. I like umbrellas from brookstone better for the price.
4,Gustbuster Metro,"Good construction. Nice color. A little smaller than I was hoping for. I have used it a couple of times so far, but it hasn't yet been put to the test in terms of withstanding wind. However, it seems pretty sturdy."
4,"Great umbrella, handle is too short",The umbrella is great - works well in windy situations as advertised.I would like the handle to be a bit longer though.
5,Worth Every Penny !!!,"This winter in the Midwest, we have had blizzards, torrential downpours, and tornadic wind and storms, and this umbrella has protected me from all that already in the few weeks I have had it. At the bus stop, other people on the campus where I work are fighting with their umbrellas being blown inside out, while I have a Chesire cat grin at my relative comforts. In some cases, people have asked me where I have gotten it since it is compact and a double canopy -- a rare find since nearly all the double-canopy umbrellas I found are the larger, ""golf"" umbrellas. This is in my backpack all the time, and I don't anticipate leaving home without it."
3,Durable,It feels very durable and can probably withstand very high winds but the stem is too short and requires you to hold your pretty high.
2,okay but far too small,looked better online. didn't realize it was so small....shame on me for not checking but not impressed with the product.
4,gust buster does what it promises,I really like my gust buster. I just wish it had a longer wrist string so that it could be locked in my locker without having to get my stuff wet.
3,Decent Umbrella,"This is a pretty good umbrella. The quality of the construction is readily apparent, and the carrying case/bag that it comes with is useful. Nevertheless, this product would greatly benefit from a longer handle -- it is a bit short. However, this will really only come into play on particularly windy days, when you will really have to hold onto the thing."
5,Vented Compact Umbrella,The umbrella is the perfect size for walking around the city. The umbrella sleeve is designed to be carried like a pocket book (over the shoulder). So far we've only had normal rainfall (and I stayed reasonably dry). I'm still waiting for that blustery rainy day where I can see how it stands up in a high wind.
5,Excellent travel umbrella,"This is my third one of these umbrellas (I tend to lose them). I carry it when travelling; it is small enough to pack in my computer bag, yet large enough to keep me dry. I find the product to be well made and reliable, and I particularly like the ""gust-buster"" double canopy."
4,grc,"I had to replace my first Gustbuster after I lost it. It had already proven to me to be far superior than those $10 umbrellas you get in a drugstore. I work in the downtown section of Boston where it can get quite windy and destroy those cheap umbrellas. Not the Gustbuster, though. My only gripe is the handle should be a bit larger as it is sometimes hard to hold on when the wind is blowing."
1,"Do Not Buy! Poor Construction, Shady Company.",Overhyped product and breaks consistantly. Returned it recently to the company for a replacement under their warranty and had to wait TWO months for a new umbrella. Kept getting the run around when I would call the company trying to find out what was the delay. Lastly consider that in order to get a replacement you will have to return the old umbrella and pay $10 under their warranty program. Shipping and costs run near $20 in order to do this. Poor product and a disreputable company makes this a poor choice.
2,fell apart all too soon,"It started out great. Then the metal ""rods"" came out of their little plastic seats, first only two them, then all of them. I used this umbrella maybe 20 times. When it worked it was great in the wind, but this short a life expectancy is unacceptable. So I called to have my warranty honored. They said ""send it back to us with a check for $10 and we'll either repair it or send you an new one.""Well, the umbrella cost me $30 when I got it, so now we're talking about $15 to get the ""lifetime warranty"" honored. Something is wrong with this picture."
3,"Well-made, but small","This is a well-made umbrella, but it is so small that the size defeats its purpose. In any storm in which the wind is strong enough to need a wind-proof umbrella, the rain is going to be coming in at an angle, and this umbrella is too small to protect me. I'm not sure where you have to measure this thing to get 43"", but it sure isn't the diameter of the canopy coverage."
2,Pink GustBuster Umbrella,The umbrella worked well in the wind except that the metal rod of the frame came off after just a couple of month use because the little screw that was used to hold it place fell off. The umbrella would be a better product if they fixed this problem.
2,What goes up but not down?,"Is it broken or actually doesn't go down? The button makes the umbrella go up, but doesn't cause it to come down. You have to strong arm it to wrestle it back down."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this EXPENSIVE umbrella the end of January and here we are now at the end of July and it's now broken. I'm very disappointed. It stood up well to wind and rain, although I do think the diameter is a little small. The next umbrella I buy will be larger. One day I open up the umbrella and the spokes had come apart... looks like 2 screw like attachments broke off... I'm not very handy, but I was thinking I could repair it if I had some wire I could string through the holes to keep them attached... I don't know... I'll just end up buying a new one."
1,Bad Construction,"I've bought two Gust Busters in the past at retail stores and had no problems. I ordered this one and it started to break fairly soon (and not from wind). Yesterday during a storm (strong breeze, but definitely not a strong wind) a few inches above the handle it snapped in two! This particular product was terrible."
2,Quality is going down.,"I used our GustBuster (pink) for the first time today and am sad to report that previous reviews are accurate. They have made a few changes in the design and materials they're using and it is affecting the quality. The mechanics don't move as smoothly as they do on our older model (about 3 years old) and the handle is a cheap plastic (as opposed to the comfortable rubber handle on the previous model). I've not tried the umbrella in heavy wind conditions yet, but honestly I'm expecting that it won't hold up as well in that area, either (like a previous review, I would think the slippery hard plastic handle will slip right out of your hand in heavy rain/winds). Very disappointed. This is actually the first time I've reviewed something here on Amazon (though I purchase often) bought I'm so shocked and sad by the decline in quality that I felt compelled to share my thoughts."
3,Size not as advertized,"Received quickly and the umbrella is well made. However, it only measures 37 inches when it has been advertised as 43 inches."
5,This is the only umbrella that works in Boston,"I have bought over 10 umbrellas over the past year in Boston-ranging from big to small, from pharmacy to high end department store and this is the only one that works against the harsh winds.The cost seems a bit steep but it is value, if you think about it, buying an umbrella per month will eventually run you this amount...I've had this umbrella for 6 months and have watched people in the street with their umbrella broken but this one does not flinch with the wind..."
3,Construction at top is poor,I bought this after seeing it on a morning news show. It is beautiful and works just as it said. But after a week I noticed the top plastic piece broke off. I have not called the company yet to see if they will replace. It appears to still be functional...but an umbrella called a gustbuster needs to stand up to normal uasage for a few years in southern California. Less than a week is a crime!
5,It's the BEST!!,"Living & working in a city filled with windtunnels, nothing can top this bad boy!! Worth every penny. Will never catch me leaving my 'failed' umbrella on the city street in the midst of a rain storm!!"
2,Worked well at first but broke after a year,"I bought this umbrella based on the reviews that I had read. However, I am sorry to say that I was disappointed when it broke after a year."
1,Falls apart during normal use,I have only used this umbrella about a dozzen times. At first it was very pretty and I got lots of compliments on it. It started to fall apart after a few uses in normal rain. First the handle strap at the end broke off. Not a big deal. Then the little plastic pieces starting comming off the metal cage. Annoying but not a big deal. I just put them back on. then the little cicrcular part on the top that keeps the material connected to the cage fell off. This was getting really annoying. Then finally I walked 20 feet though a rain with mild winds with it. By the time I got to the door the whole thing was shreadded in pieces. I am really annoyed that I paid more for an umbrella that lasted as long as an umbrella that I could have bought for a fraction of the price. I do NOT recommend.
4,"Great umbrella, small adjustments needed","I had an original gustbuster that worked great- no tears, looked great, but unfortunately was stolen a few months back. I wasn't a huge fan of bubblegum pink, but it was the only one available. The only real problem I have with it is that the button on the top of the umbrella (and the plastic screw that held it in place) fell out the first time I used it, which didn't happen with my last one. It hasn't caused any structural issues with the umbrella yet, but the same thing happened to my roommate's, so it's clearly a design flaw that needs to be fixed."
3,Good But Tiny,"The Gustbuster Metro is not suitable for the golf course, which was my original intent. However, I needed one in the car anyway and it is a perfect size for that. Excellent engineering and quality, but advertising at 43 inches (which is tip to tip, not diameter) was a little misleading."
1,It Broke,"It looked great, but it broke the first time I used it. The ribs are made partially of plastic (the outermost sections) and one of these broke at the point where it was anchored."
3,Umbrella,So far it seems good. It appears to have a sturdy built. The only thing I don't like about it is that I can't press the button so it collapses. My cheap umbrella could that. This option is great when you're rushing into your car from the rain instead of having to use both hands to close it.
2,"43"" it isn't, more like 35"" in diameter","Searched for a ""big"" collapsible umbrella that would hold up, read all the reviews and took a jump. The 43"" advertised is misleading. It only measures 35"" in diameter, 2"" bigger than my Tote's (which is less than have it's length) Doubt it will keep me dry let alone someone else. Seems there are other BIGGER collapsibles, I just didn't figure it out until it was too late.Disappointed."
1,Crappy product,The umbrella is too heavy and too large when it folds to sit in a messenger size bag. It is relatively modest when it comes to coverage area provided. Mine worked fine for a month or so and then the threadings came off the elbows. Within a day 3 more elbows came off as the brackets disjointed from the cloth. And the cloth slipped from the joints at the end. May be I got a defective piece.I decided to return but they have a clause saying you have to register your product within 30 days of purchase to avail of it. And then you pay 10 $ for shipping and handling and then they will take 4 - 5 weeks to get back to you.Saved myself the trouble and got another one for less. Dissapointed that I spent good money on this. Need a umbrella in Boston though.
2,Cute but too small,"I saw the information regarding this umbrella, but the way the measure it is confuisng. It is a good umbrella but too small!!! I wish that, for that price, they can do one that radio measures 48"". Probably my small daughter will use it to play."
5,Used in Chicago,"Bought for my daughter in grad school. She's been using it in Chicago's rainy, windy weather for the last 3 months. While everyone else's umbrellas were turning inside out, this one has taken the brutal weather and is still standing. Well made and everything is still working on it. Good price on Amazon, as usual."
1,"poor quality, lousy warranty, save your money","This umbrella looks like it would withstand a windstorm but mine died long before the hundred year storm arrived. Three of the ribs that attach to the spine lost their rivets and that rendered it useless. When I inquired about the warranty I was informed that I needed to mail the umbrella back to GustBuster along with $10 for return shipping and ""handling"". This from a company who's tagline is ""The Worldest Smartest Umbrella."" Only the World's Dumbest Consumer would spend $5 to mail this umbrella back (the trip to the post office alone is worth $20 of your time) plus another $10 in S&H to salvage a $28 umbrella."
3,looks nice! But different with website description!,"The tittle of this umbrella is 43 inches umbrella. it's 109.22CM. But the umbrella that i received is 90CM!!! it's too smaller!!!! I want to a surprised from this item. but that surprise is not a surprised like this!!!Of course, I must to admit that looks very nice. Just different with website description. if u r a guy likes me, tall and little fat, don't choose this one. it will be make u look like a clown...... I am 186CM height and 200pounds weight. I hope this should be a nice gift."
4,Review,"Product:I like that this umbrella uses heavy duty linkage, but the material looks a bit cheap. I would have liked to see a thicker material used with this heavy duty umbrella.Shipping:Unfortunately, it showed up in the color pink. I used Amazon's 1-click feature to order a ""black"" umbrella, but instead, the website obviously defaulted to pink. I never would have ordered a pink one, nor did I ever click on the color pink when viewing it. My advice to all is to be careful when using 1-click because you can't validate the item description listed in your cart. I now don't use 1-click quite as often as I use to."
1,"Broken in 3 places after a couple of times, the merchant is a liar","I used it a couple of times and it broke in 3 places. What's even worse is when I wrote a bad review about this product and its merchant, I got a phone call from the merchant to ask me take off the bad review (the one I got is an exception ... it would hurt their hard earned business ... blah blah blah) and promise to replace it with a new one. You know what, after 3 weeks I am still waiting for the replacement...I strongly recommend you walk away from this product, and the merchant - North Avenue."
4,Quite an umbrella here!,"This feels like an umbrella that could last through a hurricane. My only complaint is that it is quite large for a fold up. On the other hand, it is quite large for a fold up!"
2,Disappointed,Quality appears up to standard but the closing mechanism is difficult to grasp once the handle gets wet. Not what I am used to with the gust-buster line
2,Staff too short on umbrella,Was looking for top quality umbrella. I am 6 ft tall and the staff on the umbrella is short when it extends. Arm gets tired of holding up the umbrella. Would work good for kids.
2,Eh,"Owned for 4 years now and finally fed up with this thing. 2 of the wire prongs have been detached for over 2 years, and where I previously had to just pop them in the end plugs (annoying & time consuming) the plugs have now fallen off making it nearly worthless.My other issue is that it's always been very big & heavy when folded, yet not very large when expanded... Odd combination here.And, finally I give it 2 stars because for all its big clugginess & shoddy wire attachment it didn't fold under high winds.Now searching for a replacement.."
2,Heavy and cheaply made,"I bought this umbrella because I got tired of all my other umbrellas flipping inside out on windy days. This umbrella held up to windy days. However, after about 4 uses, I was trying to close the umbrella and it became stuck about half way down and then the handle came off in my hand. I am extremely disappointed since I only used this about 4 times if that. I would not recommend buying this product and if I still had the receipt I would return it."
1,Half Star Product,"The firt time I used it the tip on the top of the umbrella fell off and the wood varnished handle has cracked and chips easly.I bought one similar for a third of the price and I used it for two years with no problems, but my husband lost it. I poisoned him!This product had a great rubber handle with an automatic close and open button, your product only opens automatically."
2,Great when it stayed in one piece,"I bought two of these and both have broken to varying extents. On one, the plastic end cap on one of the tips of the metal frame that keep the fabric taught broke -- leaving the umbrella in a functional yet unuseable state. On the second, the plastic on the end of the umbrella that sits on top, in the middle of the dome broke. That umbrella is still useable but it is disappointing to see things like these breaking on an umbrella this expensive."
1,never saw it,"Amazon neglected to put my name on the address of the parcel, so it was rejected at the pickup address & returned to Amazon. Smooth move, exlaxGustBuster Metro 43-Inch Automatic Umbrella"
1,totally disappointed,i purchased this umbrella in december and have used it twice. the umbrella broke ... the fabric came off the spoke(s). it is a very costly umbrella and am quite unhappy with my purchase!
1,Poor construction!,"I used this umbrella a total of 4 times, mostly for sun protection, but the one day I used it for rain it fell apart. First, the carrying string broke, then the plastic top of the umbrella fell off and the umbrella came apart! What a joke and a total waste of money!"
1,GustBuster busted,"I purchased the smaller GustBuster & it was stolen. I purchased a 2nd (mistake)&, as with the 1st, the supports kept coming out of the plastic barrel shaped caps. I superglued 1/3 of them. Then the velcro straps let go. Then one of the stretch straps that hold down the vent material let go. Lastly, the material let go from one of barrel caps & it wasn't at all windy. And I hardly ever use the umbrella.I emailed GustBuster & was told to mail it back with a check for $10. I've had cheap umbrellas w/ no problems & that's what I'll put the $10 towards."
3,It's OK,"I bought this 4 years ago, and before that I couldn't get an umbrella to last more than a few months before a gust of wind shredded it. This umbrella is still working, so it really is more wind resistant than those Totes umbrellas.However, this umbrella has little else going for it. My version of the umbrella has a wooden handle; the handle to too small and very unfomfortable to hold, it's not securely attached to the shaft becuse it jiggles around making it even more uncomfortable for holding the umbrella, and the automatic open button is too sensitive making it easy to accidentally open the umbrella when you don't want it to open.It's also very large and bulky for a folding umbrella, and it doesn't fold up very neatly."
1,"Bad Construction, Bad Warranty",I only used mine less than ten times before both of the rivets holding one of the spines in place just disappeared. I'm lucky I noticed the spine was loose before it took an eye out. Then when I wrote them about the warranty I found out that I had to call them to get a return authorization and send them a check for $10 for shipping. I would NOT buy this brand again.
2,"Survives the gusts, but not the ground","So, I dropped it. BUT, It was fully extended...I had it balanced in one arm while pulling my suitcase out of the trunk of my cab (no thanks to the cab driver), and it fell from my arm 4 feet to the ground. I figured it was fine, since it was open and pretty much floated to the ground - but those extended wires are so delicate that one of them came apart! Then a couple weeks later, another one did! I learned my lesson - I'm no longer investing in 'good' umbrellas. Target Stores have cute, cheap, and fairly sturdy umbrellas that have lasted me much longer."
2,Heavy!!!,"This umbrella is very heavy and uncomfortable to hold. The button to open it is hard and frustrating. This umbrella also broke after I had it for about 2 weeks, only using it 2 times. One of the sides came off of the holding part and when I snap it back, it does not stay.This is an overpriced piece of junk!"
2,Not worth the price,"When I received this umbrella the lock function was disengaged. When I try to lock it, sometimes it springs open on it's own...When that occurs some of the extensions come apart from the umbrella and I have to place them back....flawed product...Don't waste your money!"
4,"The original ""wind proof""","The GustBuster was the first of the ""wind-proof"" umbrellas and remains one of the best. I especially like the fiberglass ""ends"" and the way they are attacted to the umbrella by elastic ""bands"" that help cushion the shock of a suddent gust of wind.Two minor cirticisms: I HAVE had problems in the past with the rivets popping loose. And I think the handle is just a bit on the small size. You notice this when it gets really windy and you are ""struggling"" to hold onto the umbrella. But other umbrellas would have folded up at this point.Overall, a good value. This is my second one. My first still sits in the car and has taken a lot of abuse over the years. It still works fine."
2,Can Stand Up to Wind but Not to Daily Use,"Yes, this umbrella (mine is a smaller 36"" version) doesn't turn inside out in wind, but it's just as poorly-constructed as a $2 umbrella bought off the street. The first thing to break was the carrying strap, then one by one, the middle rivet on each of the ribs broke. I would fix each one with a paper clip. Now, almost the entire umbrella is held together with paper clips! And this umbrella was NOT inexpensive! Soooo not worth it!"
2,Moderate quality - warranty is a joke,"The umbrella worked well for a year, then one of the ends ripped loose. The ""lifetime warranty"" requires me to pay to ship the umbrella there and to pay for shipping and handling return, which in total is more than half of the cost of the umbrella! That's not much of a warranty in my opinion."
2,Poor Construction,"I had high hopes for this umbrella in the strong wind and rain of South Florida, but it broke literally the first time I used it. One of the spokes just came completely unhinged and a little screw is gone so I can't even fix it. I still use it occasionally because it was so expensive! But I look pretty silly with a flat-sided umbrella. In my experience, it's probably better just to buy a cheap umbrella from Target so it's easily replaceable."
4,Decent,"I've had a lot of cheap crappy umbrellas. I wanted one that was small enough to carry but big enough to keep me dry. I also wanted one that was well built, and could last many years.Well, this umbrella is halfway there. The actual umbrella part is really awesome. It can withstand great winds. The expanding mechanism is durable and well constructed. It's really great at doing what it's supposed to do.The thing is, every other part of it is shoddy. The rubbery grip material on the handle rubs off. The strap on the handle fell off. The bag it comes in, with the rope attached, broke. Everything about it broke except the umbrella itself."
1,Overpriced garbage,"I got this umbrella from my company and used it for less than two weeks. One light gust of wind and this ""GustBuster"" flipped inside out and broke 1/2 of the spokes. I would not recommend this product to anyone, do not get caught up in the marketing. This thing is junk. Their lifetime warranty is a joke too, you need to pay $20 just to get them to replace the junk they sell."
1,Disappointing: Fell apart after four months of very light use,"We've had this umbrella for almost exactly 4 months. After using it twice, the velcro for one of the straps that held the umbrella closed, fell off. Today, when trying to close the umbrella, all the stays that connected to the ribs broke off, making it unusable. I've used other models of GustBuster umbrellas for years and not had any problems with the quality until now."
1,This was the worst of all books concerning Montgomery....,"This book was horrible. As a long time Anne of Green Gables fan, I must say I was very disappointed."
3,Not up to Plantronics quality,I was surprised that this product only worked for the first two weeks and now people have a hard time hearing me on this headset.Will check into my warranty.
1,Does not fit well,"This unit does not fit the ear well nor stay on, I would not recommend it, it was a waste of money for me."
5,Excellent for Use with Blackberry,"I use this with a Blackberry Bold 9000, and it works flawlessly, and people I know say my voice sounds perfectly normal and not muffled. With the Blackberry, voice dialing is possible and the MX256 makes it a joy to use. I did have to purchase an adapter cable for use with the Blackberry as Blackberry requires the use of a larger sized multi-pole plug (larger than the standard 2.5mm plug supplied with the MX256). Unfortunately, I paid FAR MORE than the current selling price... I believe I paid a bit over $50 a couple of years ago.And, having owned a number of Plantronics products, this one certainly is up to Plantronics quality standards. It simply keeps working, and have never had a problem with it. Highly recommended."
2,"Wan't what I thought, probably works fine with Motorola","Not what I thought it was, my fault. Thought it was only the small plug tip, but instead was a very specific one for and old Motorola phone only."
5,"My Heart, Too, Is Ready","This CD has exceeded my expectations. Whilst I was first introduced to the genre of Anglican chant by the most esteemed Choir of Kings College, Cambridge, the young men on this album represent the United States very ably indeed. The sound quality is so that I can pick out the inspired words of the psalter without having to read along. The organ is wonderful, and particularly adroitly showcased in ""Joy To the World."" This is a wonderful choice, having both selections from the Psalms, and beautifuly aranged hymns, some of which, sadly, I have never heard. The music will truly have your ""heart and flesh crying out for the living God.""For more wonderful Anglican Chant, try The Psalms of David, from Kings; and The Psalms of David with the Choir of St. Pauls, London."
3,Look Before You Buy What Amazon Fails To Tell You,"Amazon's suggestion bundles this DVD with the other DVDs from Echo Bridge. They give the impresion that the DVDs are part of a package of DVDs that will have different episodes on each DVD. This is not the case. Since two of the DVDs come from Echo Bridge and the third from Alpha there is a repeat of episodes. All of the episodes on the Alpha DVD are on the Echo Bridge DVDs hence it makes no sense for Amazon to make a recommendation to buy the Alpha version as a group. Bad advice. The Alpha DVD Shotgun Slade Volume 3 has ""Ring of Death"", ""Sudden Death"", ""The Charcoal Bullet"", ""The Fabulous Fiddle"". Alpha does offer Volumes 1 & 2.Video quality is what you should expect from a old TV program scratches and not too clean looking picture. Echo's version is slightly better but not much."
4,movie,was for class for my history student...was good and they enjoyed it. i would recommend it to any one for their class
2,Content Good Streaming Video very bad,The content was great....but the video was very poor!! The audio was out of sync and parts were missing... Do not recomend..
5,Very Compelling,The Search is an excellent video and I would recommend to all who have studied the Book of Genesis. I rate it excellent based upon the content and compelling evidence provided.
1,Rip off,This is WAY too much for crawfish.3LBS should run you between $9-$13.This is $30... plus another $30 for shipping.You could get 3LBS of live crawfish mailed to you(much better than pre-cooked) for the same price.
5,I love it!,This deck speaks to me in a way no other deck has. The art work is mesmerizing. I use it often and with accurate results. This is a deck I trust.
4,Dark but Nice!,"This deck is very interesting simply because it incorporates so many beautiful images in a very stylised manner. I like the effects created - they look like some old painting that have been ravaged by age somewhat.Other than that, the imagery in the cards is quite stunning. The pictures tell a story of their own. The LWB that accompanies the deck is well written too - each card has a line from a poem. Although the imagery digresses from the classical Rider-Waite imagery, the meanings come out so beautifully - its amazing.I think that each deck with a slightly varied theme, should have different images and interpretations, so that a reader can derive more and more from the card than just basic text-book meanings attached to a particular card. I believe this helps the reader exercise his/her ""psychic muscle""."
5,Beautiful and Powerful,"This deck was my third attempt on purchasing tarot cards. The first two were with the books, which the book pages were ALL OUT OF ORDER and were MISSING PAGES! It was a very aggravating afternoon at Borders, but turned out to be worth it. I choose this deck simply because of the art. I am not a goth but I love Gothic and dark artwork! The graphics on the cards are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!! I instantly fell in love them! I started to interpret the cards with the help of the small booklet and I instantaneously connected with the cards. I am a beginner and I AM SOOOOO HAPPY with these cards! I highly recommend them to anyone interested in tarot...heck I already have recommended this deck!"
1,"Poor quality, poor service.","I purchased 2 BRIGHT ID'ERs. Both arrived new and in manufacturers packing. One of them worked and the other didn't. I called the manufacturer about exchanging the non-working unit for a new one that worked. They agreed to do that but refused to reimburse me for the return shipping cost. I thought that was tacky and cheap, especially considering that I purchased 2 units at $100 each. I received the replacement unit and here it is 1 year later and that unit has stopped working. Summary: BRIGHT ID'ER quality control and customer service are non-existant. The product will cause you lots of frustration."
2,stopped working after only 5 months,"We bought this for my mother and after only 5 months, you plug it in and it flickers after only seconds then goes out completely. I bought this through Amazon and am asking the seller to replace it. Fingers crossed because it was so expensive."
5,It's hard to be a professional...,"My Aces, My Faults is a concise look at the professional tennis players of today. As a professional tennis fan, I throuoghly enjoyed the detailed training and traveling experiences Nick told of traveling with Boris Becker, Andre Agassi and others. Nick is a very unique individual--a person that not only motivates but cares for his clients. Nick shares his intimate evaluation and details of several of the tour players that, I believe, you won't find in any of their books. If your a tennis buff; this is a must read"
3,DaVinci Parker Changing Table,"Is a nice changing table long enough for a growing baby. It would take a while to outgrow it. The drawers can fit lots of things in them. But I'm really dissapointed that the top of the changing table is made out thin cardboard which is not strong enough to hold a growing baby specially if the baby likes to kick when lying down which I'm sure many babies are kickers. I had to somewhat replace the cardboard with actual wood to make the top of the table strong. I would have returned the item but I couldn't go through the hassle of returning it since I had already put it together when I realized the last piece of the changing table, which was the top of it, was made out of cardboard. My baby was also sick in the hospital and didn't have the time to return it and buy another changing table. $250 to make the top of the changing table cardboard is not worth that much."
2,"good design, poor quality","Really like the design of the product. Purchased 3 of them. 1 works well, turns on or off with a single push of that button on the transmitter. The second unit worked fine the first day, but has not worked since then. The third unit works, but switching it on usually takes several pushes of the on button, switching it off usually works with a single push of the off button."
5,It's great book,"I like the fact that the book is consistently funny--no long stretches of what appear filler material or second-rate stuff that I want to read fast just to get past. The subtitle on the title page is ""The Stand-Up book,"" and it has a lot in common with stand-up comedy--ironic observations and funny jokes, both in the form of one- or two-liners and more developed pieces. Definitely a keeper."
2,Shrinks in cold weather,"at first this product seemed like a miracle...so much better than foam weatherstripping; however, two days after putting this in we had temperatures dip in the 20s and all of it shrunk...about 1 to two inches. Not pleased."
3,Good,"Good as a display piece. Not the highest quality, but the price can't be beat. A little too tight to wear as a costume peice, unless you don't mind having your nose squished against the front."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I just bought this as a gift for myself. At the discounted price you could not go wrong. However while the outside of the helm looked the part of being ""new"" or ""fairly new"" the inside of the item was full of newly applied grey primer. The primer was there to cover the accumulated rust that had been allowed to accumulate over an unspecified amount of time. With a little work most of the primer came off within a hour or two of work. The real job will be to polish the interior to a glossy new finish or as close as I can get it. That job has already been started with a bit of work yet to be completed.You do indeed get what you pay for, discounted price ect! I wish the paint/primer had been left off to make cleaning/repairing it a less tedious job. Better yet I wish the item had been truly new and without the rust or the problems already mentioned."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this cd for my yoga practice based on previous reviews. Tho the voices are fine, the cd seems choppy, cut up, more like a bunch of unrelated experiments using segments of chants."
4,thrashback,"Do yourself a favor and buy this ep and everything Hatesphere has put out! Granted, Hatesphere is a really dumb name, this is one of the best metal bands out there!! Hatesphere play a kinda oldschool death/thrash that nobody can touch. You'll love this music if you are a fan of Death Metal circa 1990 before it became lame parody of itself. A lot of mid-paced crushing death sort of in the vain of Amon Amarth's Versus the World with just enough speed and melody to make it interesting. If you are sick of hyper-fast nerd-death metal go old school. go Hatesphere!!!!"
4,For Ozzie and Harriet Fans,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD, but I don't know if you would enjoy it as much as I did unless you were a true Ozzie and Harriet fan. I watched their television series as a child and grew up with a tremendous crush on Ricky. This ""Biography"" DVD was factual and well-done, and it kept my interest until the very end. It contained some information that was new to me, also."
5,La Fuerza del Pensamiento,"Lo considero un extraordinario libro, ya que nos permite aprender lo importante de la fuerza de nuestro pensamiento y en lo que debemos enfocarnos para tener un constante éxito en todo nuestro camino y desarrollo. LO RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE. y con mayor razón en esta etapa del desarrollo del mundo, de tanta tecnología e información, en donde nos podemos confundir. FELICIDADES AL AUTOR. P.D. Esperamos el siguiente"
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,THE PRODUCT I THOUGHT I HAD ORDERED WAS TO BE A PH INCREASER IN POWDER FORM. I EVEN GAVE THE PRODUCT NUMBER-NJ001-16. INSTEAD I RECEIVED POND PH INCREASER IN LIQUID FORM. I WAS MISLEAD AND VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2,"It might heat, but it leaks","I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He works outside and wanted something to keep liquids warm. There is no way to cap this product. I put soup in it, turned it on it's side and it spilled everywhere. It leaks, majorly! If there is any chance this product might end up on it's side, then don't buy it! Needless to say, I sent it back. So now I'm out $15 dollars and have nothing to show for it!"
1,not comfortable,"i bought this for my husband thinking he would like it cause we like the foam stuff. well, i should have bought the pillows without the contours (like a normal looking pillow) cause niether of us think this one is comfy. how does any one sleep on it??"
3,A little weak,"There's more than a little whiff of tv movie in this stereotyped tale of the young man torn between good and evil on the mean streets of Jersey. The trouble is nothing seems all that mean, though the top mafioso - Joe Chunks - does veer into weirdness in one of the final scenes. This movie has its bright spots, but there's a basic lack of believability that the pawn shop owner could possibly generate $2500 a week to pay off his mob debts. A small movie that is not terrible, just not anywhere near top notch."
2,"If you are hurting, this book won't help","This book was published by ""Simon Spotlight Entertainment."" Very appropriate, because it is somewhat entertaining. For anyone still in the suffering stage, however, look elsewhere if you need more than a smile or chuckle. On the other hand, if you are basically reconciled to your loss, or to the hopelessness of whatever you are hanging onto, this is a quick, entertaining read that will serve as a brief distraction, if nothing else."
5,A Quebec gem that deserves to be better known,"Several songs from the debut album by Justine Laberge and David Bussières topped the charts in their native Quebec for good reason: the album is great! This is pop as it should be, fun, uninhibited, lighthearted, with catchy tunes. The only weak song IMHO is Paradis Artificiels. Alfa Rococo combine the guitar, drums, and synthesizer with Laberge's vocals to create a unique sound. Some songs are somewhat reminiscent of some 80s bands."
3,Slow Process,Have used this for the past two weeks. It is a slow process but it slowly has smoothed out the bumps and has shown little improvement for two weeks. Will continue to use for the product does show improvement on Upper Thigh Areas.
3,"Great Color Pictures Of Current Ballparks, BUT...","...there aren't as many of the old, non-existant parks as one might be led to believe! There are a ""few"" here and there of the Polo Grounds, Ebbets Field, Tiger Stadium, (original) Yankee Stadium, Shibe Park, Forbes Field and Comiskey Park. But the people involved in putting this volume together missed out on several of the others such as Sportsman's Park, Crosley Field, Braves Field, etc. that are such a big part of baseball's heritage! Also, the copyright year(2004) must have been the early part of the year. Why? Simply with the mere mention of the two parks that opened this past season.....Petco Park(San Diego) and the new Philadelphia park but no pictures AT ALL!! I guess I'll have to be more careful in selecting ""books"" over the internet in the future....unless I've already had the opportunity to examine them ahead of time(locally) or received a good recommendation from a reputed individual whom I am familiar with beforehand as well!!!"
2,Low quality editing,"While the size of the photos is a treat, this book offers little else. Most every photo can be seen in other books, and the editing is just horrible. There are many captions that are clearly in error, for example, calling a US Cellular game between Chi and Clv the all-star game, and labeling a Dodger Stadium pic as being from 1983 when it is clearly within the last 4 years. Who dunnit????"
5,So nice to see a book like this,"This is such a wonderful book. The photos, the colors, it took me back to my childhood. While it was given to me as a gift, I should have bought it before. If you are looking for a gift for that baseball nut you have in your family, get them this book. You will not go wrong and they will love you for it."
2,I noticed no change in lactation,"I had problems with my milk production after a long bout of mastitis. I took every herb imaginable trying to bring my supply back up, including lactuca virosa. I personally noticed no change in the amount of milk I made but someone else might have success."
1,This is absolute garbage,"Anyone noticed that all the reviews were by the same person? It is the author.This garbage is not worth owning. The writer is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The author or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these books. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."
1,This is a Scam,"This guy has been peddling this fake Martial Art all over the internet. Check any forums... budoseek.net, e-budo.com, etc. Look at the description he gives! $100 for a 50 page booklet?!? In addition, this supposed 'master' and I use that term loosely, doesn't even write in decent english. You can tell that the two review above this one were written by the same person and that happens to be the 'author'. Come on YAHOO! Get with the program and get rid of this guys product."
1,Scarily Crazy!,"Please, please, if you are interested in martial arts, go to a reputable school in your area and take some classes. I second an earlier reviewer's post: you cannot learn from videotapes alone. And why on earth would you want someone who is obviously dealing with some severe mental health issues to teach you anything?? The incoherent, bizarre nature of the publishers comments and the fake reviews (all in the same babbling language) says it all. Trust your instincts, go elsewhere. Please. This guy sounds certifiably nuts."
4,My favorite '70s Dylan album,"I would have given this disc five stars if not for ""Joey."" This may be his worst song ever. The rest of this disc is incredible, I love the harmonies with Emmylou Harris, and the violin makes these songs so beautiful. I also can't understand why ""Mozambique"" wasn't a pop hit. This is a must own cd, not my favorite by Dylan, but worthy of four stars."
5,beautiful tie,"What's there to say? It is a beautiful tie, and its so convenient having a matching hanky. Its a bit on the thick side, and stitching is probably not the highest quality, but still pretty nice, and the design is great."
4,Reik Review,"I first read the 3rd Ear by Reik which inspired me to read this one. I was not disappointed. I learned about love and appreciate that Reik is a great thinker that can write in English. He doesn't talk over my head. My favorite section by far was a Psychologist looks at love. My least favorite was the chapter I skimmed on Masochism. Overall, it was worth my time to read. I'm looking forward to reading his other works that I have on order. Reik gives awesome insight to what love really is. Overall Listening with the 3rd Ear is better but if nothing else I would definetely recommend the first section on love."
5,titanic 2000,"After reading some of the negative comments on this film I had to put in my 2 cents. I watch alot of these movies and I found this one to be very sexy and fun. The acting is good and the cast seems to be making an effort to pull it off. The rock star parody is especialy good, and Tammy Parks is awesome as the vampire. This was a fun movie and I highly recommend it."
4,Cool movie. But you need to know what you are buying.,"The movie is funny and entertaining one. As an parody, this has nothing to see with the 'Titanic' movie (only one or other references are made).The actresses are really beautifull, the text is cool, and the image quality is cool. The sexys softcore scenes are in low quantity, but they are well made.There is only one thing that is sometime boring: they used too much chroma key effects, including in scenes that it would not be necessary.In fact, if you know the genre of movie and or like the Seduction Cinema Releases you can buy it (and review a thousand times). Otherwise, please dont spent your money on it."
1,HORRIBLE!!! I Only Gave It One Cause I Couldn`t Give It Zero,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!Filmed In A Cheap Hotel!!!!The Story Of Titanic And A Tale Of Vampires JUst Don`t Mix Good AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don`t See!And Definately Don`t Buy!It Will Be A Waste Of Your Money!
3,Meditations on mellow,If narcoleptic night jazz is your thing you'd want this in your collection- even when things start oozing apathy the album is put back on track with some great sidemen.
4,"Sure, no soul, but you'll drool while you sleep through it.","Stardate spring 1997: I'm tuned into WOUB FM, cramming for an obtuse senior philosophy final when my third eye notices the other two have glazed over. Convinced it was the soundtrack and and not the mesmerizing academic content, I call the station to find out who was slurring the guitar that caused me to space out and immediately order the CD. ""Kind Folk"" was just one of many tracks featuring intricately mellow, drool worthy duals between Bill Frisell's guitar and Dave Holland's bass. The album is the perfect soundtrack for that hoity-toity wine and cheese soiree you'll have this spring. Airy trumpet and sax accompany the strings creating stately mood music to turn off your brain. Warning: don't play near the ill or exhausted. They will pass out."
4,Soothing to the Soul,If you like music to calm your tormented spirit this one is for you. The amplitude or the recording runs from barely audible to overwhelming. You will be adjusting your volume control several times in order to fully appreciate this CD. 'The Lovers' is easier to listen to requiring less adjustment. Prayers of Kierkegaard Op. 30 was my motive for purchasing but it is over much too quickly @ 19 minutes 20 seconds. Overall my only negative thought is that the time of the pieces disappoints. The total length of both pieces is only 51 minutes 51 seconds which seems to pass too quickly for my liking. The performance is clean and typical of Barber with dramatic chorale combining with great orchestration. I would classify this CD as Operatic. Hope this helps.
1,Take with a grain of salt,"Having been presnt during some of these events Tim relates, I find the narrative skewed through omission at best, and faulty of memory when it comes to items which reflect poorly on the good Doctor. Also, he is flippantly disrespectful of those who were his source of support in trying times."
4,Better than more expensive brands,"This 2-blade razor gives a much closer shave than a more expensive brand that has more blades. The Bic Twin Select gets good mileage, and the colors are pleasant. Definitely buying more."
1,wrong music,Please check this CD. You have early music for Vaughan-Williams. The listening samples are not correct.
4,"Faith Based, but also good common sense advice","I bought this to give to a couple in crisis, I read over the book to make sure it would be the right book to give to them and overall I was impressed with the good common sense advice on how to preserve your marriage or relationship when life gets difficult"
2,Best of TV Detectives 52 episodes,"This 52 episode DVD set contains 52 episodes from Mill Creek's other offering ""Best of TV Detectives 150 episodes"". If you already own the 150 eps set you will be wasting your money by purchasing the 52 eps set. Amazon could at least list the episodes contained in these box sets so that buyers could avoid doubling up."
4,Best of TV Detectives,"The product is of good quality, actually quality you would expect from the older movies. My only disappointment was I ordered more than one movie pack; Box Office Gold, Suspense Classics and Best of TV Detectives. There were many, many duplicates. If I had only ordered one movie pack this probably would not have been a problem."
3,what can I say?,There were mostly super-old episodes that I hadn't heard of.I've heard of a lot in my timeSome were interesting if nothing elseA very few that were goodLess than that amount were really goodThree stars because there were 150 episodes
3,Robert Sirico's Bizarre Careening Chronicled,"What an interesting history from what I can see online. Especially the information dealing with the now rabidly anti-gay spectre known as Fr. Robert Sirico who is dealt with at length in this book. What is crucial to note is the vacillating, impressionable and unstable picture of Sirico that is painted. Could any reasonable person not see a parallel in his later ""conversion"" back to reactionary Roman Catholicism?? What a tawdry tale of this man displays, and for historians, one of the most pathetic ambles through complex moral issues possible. Sirico and Seattle's gay history is a very telling and damining matter."
1,Breezy but slight history,"Readable but superficial history of Seattle gay life from the anti-sodomy days a century ago to its appeal many decades later. Atkins offers nothing like the sophisticated analysis of George Chauncey's Gay New York or even recent gay and lesbian histories of Portland, Oregon or Buffalo, New York."
4,Nice and sweet,"A very nice, even sweet album of countrified pop from Mr. Dylan. It shows he doesn't have to get fancy to show us a good time."
3,Seems slight to me,This is an OK album - but it's criminally short. It's a great idea and Bob's voice never sounded...well...like this. But it's not a good value and some of it sounds tossed off to me.
4,Classic Dylan,This hybrid sounds as smooth as silk. Standout tracks Lay Lady Lay and Girl From The North Country. A must have for Dylan fans
4,Very pleasant -- but only 27.12 minutes duration,"One of the nice surprises about early Dylan albums is how many of them breach the 50-minute mark (e.g. THE FREEWHEELIN'). So it comes as a shock to find that this album (recorded in both 1963 and 1969, according to the sleeve) contains less than 28 minutes of music.That said, this is the album in which Dylan proved that he could sing in a more-or-less conventional way. And it was also the ground-breaker that cleared the way for all sorts of country-rock crossover bands such as Poco, the Eagles, Gram Parsons etc.For those new to the album, the tune you probably know -- 'Lay Lady Lay' -- is not the best here. It was really nice to hear the other nine songs which are completely new to me, some of which are cos-ung with Johnny Cash."
4,What a Great Album (When You're in the Mood),"Sometimes, all I want to listen to is Nashville Skyline. Addmittedly, I tend to pull out B.O.B. and B.I.A.B.H. more often, but this album is just quirky enough (for Dylan) to suit certain moods. Lay Lady Lay is great, and so is Girl From the North Country w/ Johnny Cash. It just makes you feel good!"
3,Disappointed.,After I purchased this book I found it on another site at a substantial savings. Over 1/2 the price and it was new not used.
2,Don't like very much,I bought the knobs so I wanted the matching pulls too. The knobs are great the pulls not so great. It didn't look like the picture it looks very cheap. Lets just say I got what I paid for.
3,film? Digital? Or do I have to guess?,The reviews need to say - FILM camera. I scanned the entire thing for evidence of digital details like Mega Pixels or screen details and saw nothing. I know what I'm looking for - but I think that you should make it easier for the uninitiated. . . in order to avoid disappointment hen they buy it - expecting a digital and get a film camera . . . keep it simple. . .
3,Magazine & Trade Publication Reviews of the 61-69 Lincoln.,"This book is a collection of reviews and articles from major automotive publications about the 'classic' 61-69 Lincoln Continental automobiles. As such, you will be able to read how the Lincoln Continental compared (quite favorably, I might add) to other full-sized American luxury cars of that era."
2,Okay but not much else.,Ive never really liked early Bob Dylan except or a few songs.I mean hes a talented writer in that he can write words that go well with each other but sadly his early work just doesnt speak to me except for the more well known tracks.It just all sounds like a bunch of nonsense that isnt even amusing.I think this album is a waste of time to listen to except for a few songs and I dont understand what is so good about it.Its boring.
4,Nicely done album.,"At this time, Bob was warming up to do his masterpieces like Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde, its not his best album, but its definitly worth a look.This album has alot of variety, jaunty rockers {Subterranean Homesick Blues, Maggies Farm}, love songs {She Belongs To Me, Love Minus Zero/No Limit}, haunting poetic epics {Gates Of Eden, Its Allright Ma} and masterful classics {Mr. Tambourine Man}."
2,No point in getting the SACD version,"Columbia did such a mediocre job of recording Dylan and other great musicians in the early days (most painfully for me, Laura Nyro...) that an SACD version of the original crappy sound is just pointless. I have three of these reissues and basically I'd just as soon listen to my scratchy LPs."
1,Unpolished talent needs to hone skill,"Rising Talented Star, could use a little polish and vocal lessons.I saw this on sale at Sam Goody, and since I still had a couple of dollars after purchasing the latest and greatest from Saliva, I decided to give this new fad of singer songwriters a chance.I was put off by his lack of originality in lyrics. I mean, come on, almost all of his tracks were already done by much better artists such as: The Gin Blossoms, Five For Fighting, and the timeless Toad the Wet Sprocket.If only he took a note from the Limp Bizkit, perhaps he could learn a thing or two about heart-felt songwriting."
5,A good place to start,"Bringing It All Back Home, released in 1965, is Bob Dylan's first flirtation with electric rock/ blues. Since the album is half electric and half acoustic, it is a perfect place for new fans of Dylan to start because they get a sample of both his electric rockstar side and his folk singer side.The album has quite a diverse selection of songs; fast, bluesy songs (""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", ""Maggie's Farm"", ""Outlaw Blues""), slower, melodic love ballads (""She Belongs To Me"", ""Love Minus Zero/ No Limit""), poetic folk songs (""Mr. Tambourine Man"", ""Gates Of Eden"") and comedy (""Bob Dylan's 115th Dream""). One of the best songs on the album is the surreal ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"". This song always fills me with inspiration everytime I listen to it.This is a great album and a good place to start."
5,This one is a masterpiece,"Probebly Dylan's first Great Rock & Roll album. All filled with superb songs, especially on side two. ""It's All over Now, Baby Blue"" is probebly his finest song of dismissal. A definitive Dylan album."
4,"Be kind, rewind","Dylan's ""Bringing It All Back Home"" is a sweet recall to yester-year. Though I was not alive during its original production, the twangy sounds and folk rhythm of Dylan's early caricatures and tones are present here as they would have been in local fairs and spring town festivals. After watching a YouTube video of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" I hope to find a sound that replicated the stage and aura, and his album continues to do just that track after track. A must for any music enthusiast and fans of a great musician as well, ""Bringing It All Back Home"" certainly adds a unique and necessary component to this American music fan's library."
3,SACD sound quality of early Dylan recordings,"This review is not for the content, but the SACD sound of the album. Frankly, it is underwhelming. Understandable, based on the source material. Ability to listen to this one in 5.1 is a bonus, but if you are expecting miracles to happen you will be disappointed. The sound quality of Blood on the Tracks is much, much better, but then it was recorded about 10 years later in 1974."
4,Cronology of Comics,"Garfield Takes the Cake (#5) contains all daily comics from November 3, 1980 through June 7, 1981. Garfield's Second Tresury contains the color version of all the sunday comics held within #5."
5,A Masterpiece! My son LOVES this book!,"This is a spectacular book on so many levels. I don't know where to start as there are so many details that make this book unique. From the flip-style design that reads different (and from different perspectives) to the colorful illustrations, this book is heart-warming. My son has a collection of hundreds of books we read before bed each evening, but recently this has been the selection that he always chooses. Highly recommended!"
5,Great concept!,"I love how this book is set up in that the ""love never ends""...I read it to my 19 month old at least every other day and he really seems to enjoy it!"
1,execrable treacle,"This is the worst sort of saccharine, platitudinous writing for children, made all the more foul by some of the poorest pastel technique I have ever seen in the illustrations. A lot of folks swear by it, and I suppose I should be touched by the plucky, can-do spirit of its creator. I wish her the best, and I don't judge you or your children for finding it precious. Ahem. But I won't be reading it to my son again."
5,Excellent!,"Fast delivery! This book is awesome! I bought it for my granddaughter for her 8th Birthday because we play the ""I love you more"" game on the phone and she always wins! I can't wait to sit down with her and flip it back and forth and back and forth and back and forth! Even though the book is about a little boy and his Mommy, I'm going to do a little ""artistic editing"" to personalize it to ""Nana and Granddaughter"". I'd love to see this book written with different relationships but it's still wonderful and I recommend it to everyone who loves smeone who loves them more!"
2,Not what I expected,"I have only ever seen this book with 10.8 x 9.6 x 0.4 inch dimensions. That is what I expected when I ordered the book. I never saw the dimensions listed, but the book delivered to me had dimension of 4.9 x 5.8 x 0.6 inches --half the size. It may have been my fault, but I do not remember seeing those dimensions when I ordered the book. Just something to be aware of."
2,"Great heater, except for one major defect -- the noise!!!","I like this heater a lot except for one aspect that drives me nuts -- the noise!!!! It clangs and thumps at random intervals, so is not good for the bedroom if you are trying to sleep. If you wack it the noise stops but then may return at 4am. Since it's too late to get my money back, I'm going to relegate this one to the livingroom, and find another (quieter) one for the bedroom."
2,timer is difficult to use,"I've never sent in a review before, but after reading the one posted Dec 6, in which the writer says that she loves the timer, I felt obligated to write. Another reviewer mentioned that he doesn't use the timer.Having used oil-filled heaters (usually great) in the past I was hoping that the Solaris with a timer would be the ultimate gentle heater.Unfortunately, the timer is nearly impossible to use. It is on the side and the only way to adjust the timer is to lift the whole unit- hot or cold, or get down on your hands and knees. The timer is 7"" above the floor. Because there is no manual override, which is unbelievable, for occasional use it is necessary to adjust the entire timer- over, and over again. That's means pushing up or down 96 fragile little plastic pins. The timer is obsolete.After closer review of other heaters I believe there are better products out there."
3,it started good but 2 years into it not convinced anymore,"I bought my first unit at the end of october 2004 and loved it! It worked great in my bathroom where I used to hate coming out of the shower, I liked it so much I bought a second unit that next year. That's where the problems began. The second unit was somewhat defective, it made a vibrating sound all the time it was heating, the unit is supposed to be super quiet but this noise made it so anoying! They wanted me to take it to their service department for checkup, instad the retailer game me my money back and took the unit back. I was left with one unit only. Now early winter I began using the first unit again, three days into it the noise began in this unit too!!!!!!!! I could not believe it! I thought that since I paid over $100 for this baby it would last at least 5 years, now I'm trying to see what the manufacturer has to say about 2 similar problems in different units. If someone else has had the same sound please let us know."
2,Worked great- now broken after 11 months.,"This heater works well when it works. I put it away in the spring and took it out the other night to find that it no longer gets power. I contacted their customer service for repair/replacement, and it's going to cost me $22.50 (UPS Ground) to send it in for service + whatever packaging materials I have to buy. It is also distracting until you get used to the clicking (I am assuming it's the timer making the noises).Overall, I don't think I would purchase this heater again."
3,Compact but noisy,"I was drawn to this product by its low price and some favorable customer reviews, although there were also some negative reviews. We use it to heat a very small bathroom in Southern California. It does a satisfactory job of heating, but it emits an irritating hum most of the time when it's on. It was not well assembled--the plastic casing at one end does not meet the metal body as it should. I expect that I'll eventually buy another heater and relegate this one to the garage."
3,quit just warranty expired,I had this product for just past the warranty and worked well but suddenly would not turn on
4,Great steak knife set,This is a great steak knife set in a stylish box. This is the same series my main knife set is from so I got these to match it. These are a high carbon knife so don't let them sit in water for too long or they will mark and rust. Personally I hand wash these just like I do my chef knives
5,Just Perfect!,I sent these as a housewarming gift to my son and his roommate and they just HAPPENED to match a chef's set that his roommate already had! My son loves them and is really glad his Mom thinks of stuff like this to send him.
5,Excellent Knives!,"I purchased these knives to use for our holiday dinners in the next few weeks because our current knives are in very rough shape. I thought the price was excellent and if they dulled quickly or broke, it wouldn't be a huge loss. After receiving these and seeing the quality, I threw out our old knives and started using these! They are serrated and cut through meat and poultry with ease. I read that I could put them in the dishwasher, but have been handwashing them because it helps to keep them sharper longer. Overall, I am incredibly pleased with this purchase and I may even get another set to give as a gift!"
4,Steak Knives,"I had searched for knives that were attractive on the table and that would cut easily. These are beautiful, sleek, fit your hand well with a nice weight to them and do cut with ease. The price was reasonable and I am very happy with them."
1,Rusty after 4 months!,"Updated review (12/22/11) - Our knives have officially begun to rust. We've really gone out of our way to gently wash them by hand and yet they still got rusty. I have to say, I'm really surprised that they didn't last longer. With the great reviews that this product got, I really expected more. Glad we didn't pay a fortune for these.Original review - We just picked up this set of Chicago Cutlery after our Cuisinart set started to show some age. Right out of the box, the knives are very sleek and pleasing to the eye. They also feel good in your hand. As for performance, they've quickly sliced through whatever we've put in front of them.Thus far, they've held up well after quite a few washes. One thing I'm always concerned about with knives like this is the potential for rust, but thus far it's been fine. I'd recommend this set."
1,Rust spots after second washing (on china setting),"This was the second, of two Chicago Cutlery all stainless steak knives we have bought.The first set was light weigh and hollow.This set feels much better in the hand.The first set of hollow knifes we used day to day and every washing they left rust spots on the blades.A dinner party for out of town guests had us buy this new set of solid Chicago Cutlery all stainless steak knifes.As I said, we loved the feel and look until we washed them, same damn rust spots on the blades!I have lost my respect for Chicago Cutlery after constantly fighting rust spots on the blades.Product is make in china.My old Zwilling J.A. Henckels that have wood handles are our back-ups for now, they are worn, but have never produced rust spots after washing."
5,Simple Sleek Steak Knives,"Love my knives, they work great, and are sleek, and will match most other stainless steel silverwear sets. Also like the case they come in. Beware of washing in dishwasher- need to wipe the soap spots off after."
2,You get what you pay for,"In an attempt to save $ on overhead door garage door bottom seal, I purchased two of these items. I did a fresh level adjustment on garage door before installing this new MD seal and installed it with screws instead of the enclosed nails. I placed the screws w/washers every 12 inches and kept torque on the remaining seal as I inserted the screws into the door bottom. The job came out well as far as appearance but not so well as far as sealing the door bottom. I recommend spending the $ to get a better made seal if you are looking for something to keep out rain water, dust, etc."
4,Almost fills the gaps,"The 16 foot roll stretched to fit my 19 foot double garage door. The kit comes with plenty of large-headed, aluminum nails. On my single bay garage door I learned to stretch the rubber tight so that gaps do not occur between the nails. I tried a staple gun, but the nails worked better. The seal was water tight."
4,Good product that does the job inexpensively,"It looks good and seals out rain, heat, cold & bugs well. It is important to install it correctly for a good fit. An alternative door bottom was going to cost $68 so I found this to be a good value. As I own seven rental homes and one personal home, I'm always searching for good value in products to maintain my homes well."
2,Picture does not reflect actual product,"After having purchased a Garage door bottom rubber from Home Depot that turned out not to work I checked Amazon and found what I thought was exactly what I needed.The picture was identical to the bottom rubber I had taken off, but when the M-D product arrived, it was not what the picture showed, in fact it was exactly the same asthe one I had gotten from Home Depot.Buyer beware when looking at the pictures that accompany the products."
3,I wish this item was a little wider,I guess for replacement is OK . But they need to make it a little wider . My older garage door has a wider one . I replaced the old one with this one and I wish the manufacturer of this gasket will think to make it wider .
2,I leave the gap,"I bought this to replace my worn out one. However, the new one doesn't seal entirely. I know my garage door is not straight. In the right and left corner I put the patched of sponge seals of several stack. It is a mess."
3,Disappointed,Was a little disappointed in this item. Did not disclose that item did not have inserts included in item like other sellers do. DVD's had finger prints and were dirty on the front. Also box will not reclose properly after opening.
3,Yawn.,"I'm a season 1-3 guy. But when I bought season 4 a few months back, I was surprised how great it was. Episodes like ""Der Tag"", ""The Gun"", ""The Interview"", and several others made the absence of Henry and Trapper (not to mention Gelbert) much easier to take. Where was the drop in quality I was expecting? Turns out I was off by a year, because season 5 is a major letdown. Alan Alda and Loretta Swit especially disappoint as they begin to play themselves rather than their characters, and Larry Linville's boredom with Frank Burns is palpable. Turns out war may just be hell after all."
2,MASH season 5,"This was a good show in its day, but it is getting very old this many years later. The quality of the video could be a lot better."
3,About Burns being a one note character as described here,"He was given a few bits of depth right from season one to season 5 (his, of course, last). In one fifth season ep as Margaret is going on her honeymoon with Pennobscott Frank is seen looking, while in deep thought, at her departing helicopter and says ""Bye Margaret"" (or something very close to that I forget the exact quote). That's depth of character. He realizes all he had between him and Margaret is over for real. Also, Potter seemed to me to be avery well defined character by season 4. So did BJ."
1,"Suck it, Alda","This show was only any good at all when Stevenson and Rogers were in the cast. Morgan was great, but BJ Hunnicutt was too much of a wussbag for comedy to continue. Alda proved too much of a bleeding heart to handle this comedy."
5,MASH--Season Five,My husband loves it! He is a MASH fanatic and only needed two more DVDs to complete his collection. I was impressed by the speed of my transaction and of the delivery of what I had bought. The condition of the DVD package is practically mint--I would have never guessed it was used by looking at the package. I would definetly buy from this seller again. Thank you!
3,good but too long,"This a very extensive book with five or six main ideas, The topics and examples are good, but most of the time is overkilling the issues. This work could get the target with half of the pages"
2,Disappointing,"Sorry to have to be the first person to give this book a bad review, but I don't feel this book is anywhere near a five star work. Let me be clear I am not one of these atheists who go around ripping books they've never read because they hate anything that is not completely materialistic. I am very much open to the idea of intelligent design and believe, like the author, that science and faith can exist harmoniously. This book, however, presents very flimsy arguments and does so in a very incoherent way. The Guru-Geek dialogues also brought this book down considerably in my opinion. The author raised a few good points but for the most part this book was highly unreadble, jumped around, and didn't present a very good case."
2,The Wonder of it All,"I'm 200 pages into it and stuck. Getting through this book is like trying to shovel tightly packed snow with a plastic shovel. It might not be impossible, but it sure is difficult. For his next book, I hope the author will hire a decent ghost writer. I think English is his second language, or so inferred by his writing. You're better off with either Polkinghorne or Schroeder. If nothing else, you'll at least understand them."
1,Misses the Mark,"The reader will find a substantial challenge to the arguments put forth in the chapter on Spiritual Monism in terms of the physics of ""outer space"" in the textRC Series Bundle: Wholeness and the Implicate Orderby David Bohm.In terms of the physics of ""inner space"", the reader might findFreedom from the Knownby Jiddu Krishnamurti to be of interest."
2,Monotonous Noodling,"I became aware of Dino Saluzzi through his work with Al DiMeola on a couple of DiMeola's world music projects. With DiMeola, Saluzzi's bandoneon was dreamy, other-worldly and at times just downright awesome. On Cite de la Musique it is mostly the opposite: droning, aimless, and downright monotonous. Not that there are no occasional flashes of talent...there ARE...they are just few and far between. Jose Saluzzi on acoustic guitar keeps my interest in the CD up just enough to keep from dropping off to sleep at midday. If I were a doctor for patients with sleep disorders, I would recommend Cite de la Musique as a cure swift and sure. For the occassional burst of brilliance, I award two stars. The rest is just monotonous noodling."
5,Perfect,What a wonderful gift of words! Can't wait to re-read the book and then some. For anyone looking for what is there but having a hard time finding the path. All inclusive map
4,The Case For Faith,"Like Lee Stroebel's other DVD ""The Case For Christ,"" I was deeply moved and encouraged in this otherwise discouraging world we live in. Everyone should see this."
3,Plain Brown Book,"The heroine, Alexa Powell, is a light-skinned, quick with a quip African-American columnist who knows how to live well. This is made abundantly clear to us while she plays a slick game of Sleuth during which she and her ostentatiously well-educated, well-off African-American/colored/Black <as she calls them interchangeably> pals cavort through fine hotels, posh resorts and tony restaurants. The author, also light-skinned, evidently has a race-related chip on her shoulder the size of Hoover Dam. As a woman of color who is also a writer, I wished she would stop bashing us over the head with her contempt of Caucasians and get on with writing a witty novel with very appealing characters. Now that it's hopefully out of her system, maybe she'll relax and instead of taking every opportunity to snipe at ""WPs"", she'll let Alex be the smart, intuitive babe we all know she is under that touchy I'm-so-colored-and-don't-you-forget-it carapace."
4,Nicely done,"Plain Brown Wrapper is well-written, the characters are well developed and it has a good premise (a murder at an NABJ convention) but --- I think the book works better as a primer on fine hotels, cuisine and the French language than as a mystery. You can read entire chapters and forget that you're reading a mystery actually, but I did like the book and the Alex Powell character. Thank God for a black female character that's not a typical ""sistagirl"" reciting all of the Gucci and Versace and her closet. Bates wisely describes clothes and shoes without copping out and letting a designer name suffice for description.Overall, it's well done. A far better portrayal of upper middle class, educated blacks than what is typically available."
3,So/So,I found the story to be too full of details. Each character was described with more adjectives than I felt necessary. I do hope that the author will continue to write but focus more on the story than every detail of all the surroundings.
2,Boring,"This book was slow and boring. The author attempts humor in the main character, but all I got was irritation. I could not finish it, I didnt even get half way through!"
2,Not what I expected.,"I love ""sister sleuth"" fiction so I couldn't wait to get this book. After reading this book, I should have waited to borrow it from the library. I think the main character Alex Powell was a good character but the overall story just didn't have enough ""kick"" to it to make a good mystery. The story was so bad that to this day I don't remember who killed Alex's friend Ev. If this is the beginning of a new mystery series, this is a poor start."
2,Could've been terrific,"This book could have been terrific but it's overcome by it's flaws. First, the heroine is smug and self righteous. She has no convincingly strong motivation to find the killer other than curiosity. The victim wasn't interesting enough for me to care who killed him. The author had an incredibly annoying need to describe in detail what exact shade each black character was and she spent way too much time talking about the heroine's and everyone elses clothes. The one thing I did enjoy was the roman a clefs. One character is clearly meant to be John Johnson of Ebony Magazine. I won't be buying anymore Alex Powell mysteries."
4,African-American Chick-Lit Meets Whodunnit,"I picked up this book at a little bookstore (Melodrama Books) that just opened up in my neighborhood in Queens. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Alexa Powell and Paul Butler are a fun quick-witted pair who gives us an intriguing look into the world of Black publishing. The mystery is secondary to the fascinating cast of characters, but I still thought it was an enjoyable whodunit as well. Alexa and Paul have sort of a Black urban Nick and Nora Charles thing going on. From the opening ""manure tossing scene"" which left me in stitches, to the end - the writing is hysterical! Bates has a wonderful sense of humor. She also has a wonderful eye for character detail even when it comes to the lesser characters. And her descriptions of people in their respective environments - such as the Martha's Vineyard set and New York subway riders - was not only funny but in some cases quite accurate. I will definately be purchasing the next book in the series."
1,Who cares?,"I put the book up for sale at page 102 because the author spent so much time describing peoples' clothes that I thought I was reading an extremely long version of People magazine. But I figured if I paid $7 for the book, I may as well read it. The relationship between Paul and Alex was so interesting that it caught my attention. 243 pages: I still don't care about who killed Everett, I still could care less about strangers' clothes or furniture, and the lady has spent so much time talking about being black that she's annoying me (and I'm black!) There is no way I can finish this book."
4,Will the Real Alex Powel Stand Up!,"I love African American mysteries. Fun ones are hard to find. Don't know how I found Plain Brown Wrapper, but glad I did. Alex Powell reminds me so much of the KGB I used to work with. Much to her credit, she hasn't changed over these more than twenty years. The snappy repartee, the ""almost excruciating"" descriptions of the characters, food, drink and places are not put ons. It's not snobbery. She's the real deal. Her articles were always well detailed so that you weren't left with questions after reading them. Although this was a murder mystery, I laughed with true enjoyment throughout the book. My sister and my daughter both borrowed this book and loved it. I moved on to Chosen People and wish I didn't have to wait until her next book, hopefully another mystery."
4,mats,"love the color, but they are constantly, changing with water, or food stains, not sealed or something, wish they were as durable as the white counterpart"
1,Arrived broke,Arrived bent in half. Very poor packaging. Not worth the effort to return it. Very aggravating and shame on UPS too for handing the badly packaged product so roughly.
3,Grap on...,Should add length to reach back over my sun room about 25 feet. I expect snow so I can use it...
1,other reviewer seems correct.,"The phone and data connections are different sizes. It may be better to search for RJ-45(data socket)than cat5e which appears to be the cable designation. Anyway thanks to the previous reviewer who prevented me from purchasing the wrong item.Extra info:To be fair to the manufacturer RJ-45 is a telephone associated designation but used for data. The correct designation for the data socket is 8P8C, search for 8P8C and you will come up with almost nothing."
1,Deceiving description,"Ignore the Cat5 description for this product. It only comes with a standard phone jack and coax cable. If that is all you want it for then not a bad deal, but personally I don't even know that many people that are still concerned about their land line."
4,Pretty good book,My boyfriend is Burmese and he said that this book is pretty authentic. The only problem I had was that a few of the dishes I was interested in making were for 16 people. I never really cook for that many people and haven't found the time yet to adjust the ingredients.
4,Great looking watch,"Unfortanately I haven't been able to take this watch diving yet. It looks great on my wrist though. I haven't even changed the bands yet, the white one looks very classy. Just picking it up you can tell it is very sturdy"
5,Worth It,Actually bought the book for my boyfriend who is currently working on my business website - he found the book very interesting and helpful.
3,Can do better,"The autor can do better. The book are limited on few search engines, exitst most software that search all kind of data in the internet world better than this book."
4,"Good source, but slowly becoming dated","Its always risky to buy a web guide, when by its own omission, half of the web sites will be dead in two years. My own use of the web addresses in the book, found a few dead, but the author's ""invisible web"" web site had updated links. As search engines get better the current ""invisible webs"" becomes more visible, and are probably replaced with a new class of invisible webs. My own recent search was able to find many of the ""invisible sites"" in this book, so perhaps this book is best at giving you ideas of how to search better, for example if your looking for books search for ""Library of Congress"". In the context of where this review is, Amazon is a great translucent source for info on books."
2,OLD AND INVALID,"This WAS a fantastic book. Many of the websites referenced in this book are defunk, deleted, or redirected.This book is from 2001. No new editions, that I know of.There is useful information within, but what may have been enlightening at the beginning of this decade is common knowledge today. Good references. Great book for its time. Well written.But even the books own websites are closed."
2,"A great book for its time, but all you need is the title now...","I read this book in 2001 and it really opened my eyes. Unfortunately, it is impossible to keep up with advances on the internet, and all that information would be outdated for 2012.However, just learning the catch phrase ""Invisible Web"" will serve you well enough. Do a google search on that term in quotes and you will find dozens of fantastic articles online, providing the updated information and an amazing number of resources and Invisible Web search engines."
4,"Very Comfortable, but huge","Be careful the sizing you choose, I'm normally a size 10/11 but when I ordered those they were HUGE, so I'm now going with size 6/7."
5,Brief,"Love this brief!!!! I've used these for years, they wear really well and are so comfortable........a little pricey though. You need to shop around."
3,Not what I thought they were,"If I'd known these were made by Hane's then I never would have ordered them. The reason I needed panties was because the last ""package"" of panties I bought were Hane's and they basically disintegrated on me. I'm hoping that since these panties are sold individually & have a much higher price tag, that I can wear them for a while without them coming unraveled. I never intended to buy Hane's again but when I got them, in fine print on the tag, made by Hane's.The panty is pretty enough and though I like the fabric, liners will not stick to it. That's a huge problem for women who have to wear pads, rendering them basically useless. They have a nice fit, which is probably the best thing I can say about them. If they don't fall apart then the only problem is the pad thing; so if that's not an issue for you,then maybe these will be okay.I had no problems with shipping, packaging or the seller."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for more support, and I did not like the fit. Too high up on the waist, and they ride up. Not flattering at all."
2,Bummer... They creep up on me,"Aw bummer... I bought these to replace some black cotton Bali briefs that I loved, but are discontinued. Yes, the waist band is wonderful, but the leg openings ""creep up"" on me. The openings seem to be loose to avoid panty lines, but they also don't stay down and cover my cheeks all the way. They're driving me nuts. Gotta take them off :-)"
4,An awesome live jazz/rock/fusion concert .,"Steve Gadd is one of the most in demand studio drummers of the last 30 years. His name appears on the music credits of almost every big name artist of the modern music era. He has played for Paul Simon, Dr John, Joe Cocker, Aretha franklin, Ray Charles, Steely Dan, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, and Stuff just to name a few. The ""Gadd Gang Live At The Bottom Line"", Proves to be totally captivating, along with band mates Cornell Dupree, Eddie Gomez, Ronnie Cuber, and the late Richard Tee, they deliver a flawless performance. Wait until you hear them rip into ""signed Sealed Delivered"", ""Them Changes"" and ""Watching The River Flow"". If your a fan of the jazz/fusion group ""Stuff"" this cd is a must. It's a shame that great music like this is only available on import, but fans of progressive jazz will find it a worthwhile investment."
4,Booda Skins Forever!,"We have four Bichons and they each have their favorite toys. No matter what else you get for them, they always return to their first, favorite toy.So, it was very important for our Murphy (#2 Bichon) to get a reliable supply of the Boody Skin large bone plush toy. These have become near impossible to find in the stores, but thanks to Amazon and their vendors we've been able to get enough pieces year after year to keep Murphy very happy in his senior years.These are the original high-quality Booda Skin 9"" bones that get played with a lot and last around three months before needing some repair work. Picking up four every year does the trick.Thanks to Amazon and Ozbo for keeping this item in circulation. We got what we wanted when we wanted it."
2,wrong actors,"Francesca Annis especially was simply the wrong choice to play Tuppence. She looks more than 40 years old, rather than a young 20-something woman. Her partner, whose name I can't remember at the moment, was also too old. It made the shows leaden and ridiculous rather than light and fun."
3,Mysteries solved,Tuppence is just too silly for my liking. I stopped watching after Episode 2. Might give it a try again.
3,Actors too old to play Tuppence and Tommy,Really distracting to see someone so wrinkled playing Tuppence and Tommy looks fifty years old. Why couldn't they find someone younger to play them?
5,Don't let the cover scare you away this book rocks!,"This book is so adorable and yet challenging in many ways. I have heard it said that just as many people were won to Christ by Mrs. Schaeffer's cinnamon rolls as by Mr. Schaeffer's sermon. After reading this book I was so inspired at how God has indeed used Mrs. Schaeffer's life and home for His glory. (The Schaeffer's founded a wonderful ministry called L'Abri in Europe.) As I read her book I felt as though I had found a wise, godly women's feet to sit at and learn. Throughout the book I felt encouraged in my walk with the Lord and spurred on to greater creativity in making my home a place to serve God."
5,Pass on the Commitment . . .,"Thank you for those who made it possible for me to acquire so many affordable copies of ""Created for Commitment"" (the autobiography of Miss A. Wetherell Johnson). Each copy has been given to ladies who attend Bible Study Fellowship. God's love, grace and mercy and Miss Johnson's life story needs to be told to all. Praise God and thank you!!"
5,Pneumatic Storm Door Closer,This closer replaces a wind damaged unit installed on one of my rear doors. It controls the opening and closing of this glass panel door thus protecting the glass segments from excess slambing as well as offering resistance to protect the hinged section of the unit.
1,Bummer,This toy has broken already and my sons tooth has not fallen out. Very fragile. I would go old school and just save it yourself.
4,Love the simplicity,I have not had an opportunity yet to use this with my children but bought it in anticipation for the day my oldest loses his first tooth. I pondered several options for our tooth fairy tradition and this was the perfect one for our family for many reasons1. Placing the little tooth inside this big tooth will make finding the thing much easier.2. My kids LOVE anything that glows in the dark so convincing them to leave it on the nightstand is much more likely.3. I can use it for each child unlike a monogrammed tooth pillow so it fits a limited budget and I don't have to store multiple items and keep up with them.4. I fell for the elf on the shelf tradition and have a hard enough time keeping up with that so I'm not really up for anything complicated anymore;)
4,"Adorable, fun idea...be aware however","That this is my 2nd one and both of them don't latch very well. The outer latch basically just lays there and doesn't actually latch close the tooth. Not a big deal, just be aware of this. The interior hidden pocket area closes securely. My 7 year old has loved his for years and coins the size of a gold dollar coin and smaller will fit in the compartment where the tooth goes. Anything larger can just sit on top of the inner compartment, but again, this is where the defective outer latch may become a slight issue...it truly glows in the dark - a fun bonus!"
3,"""Hillbilly viewpoint""","Having ancestral connections with the Holston River and Cumberland Gap areas of Tennessee and Kentucky, I was particularly interested in this book. Lawlor has done her typically good job of historical accuracy. This is a good trade book to use to supplement a middle school curriculum, and I recommend it as such.I was delighted with the examples of superstitions peculiar to the people of the time period. The language and expressions were also meaningful as I have heard my older relatives use the same expressions.What I find annoying in each of the American Sisters books is the constant sibling conflicts. While I know, of course, that these exists, it seems Lawlor works overtime to make the conflicts a part of the story, when usually they add nothing to the plot or storyline.Overall, this book is an easy read and informative."
1,Watch for shipping costs!,"Highly misleading price! This seems like a bargain until you see the shipping costs: $111.I didn't buy this, just a warning!"
2,"Great Product but not ""Plasma Proof""","This is the best IR receiver I've tried;it's ""plasma resistant"" but a long way from ""plasma proof"". The design is good and the unit is useful (used daily).However the feeedback LED flashes constantly with our NEC 42mp3 even when placed 8-12"" above and 12"" behind the screen. We've tried using ferrites on the cord and filters at the IR repeater but without any noticable improvement.The remote commands seem to get through about 80% of the time but the constant flashing is annoying.If you want an excellent value in an IR recevier buy this one just don't expect it to work miracles with a plasma screen."
4,Amusing comedy team,"Very few movies even touch on World War One. This 1930 film features the comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. Bert generally plays the smarter snappier of the duo, Robert plays the soft hearted, soft headed sap. The pair are AWOL in Paris, where Woolsey falls in love with Dorothy Lee's character, who is the daughter of the Colonel who would love to bring them up on charges for their antics. There's singing, there's dancing, there's slapstick, there are snappy one liners and running gags (One MP seems to have his only line as ""ME TOO!"") The cinematography might be a bit foreign to modern film buffs, the voices seem sharp and tinny, and some of Bert Wheeler's physical comedy (different walks etc) might initially strike a modern viewer as weird. But for the money, this is a great movie--funny, clean, and full of zaniness. I enjoy it more and more every time I watch it."
5,Excellent Collection of figures but where is a Ammit?,Excellent Collection of figures but where is Ammit? My 6 year old loves this figures and is generally enthralled by Egyptology for all its weirdness. Excellent selection except for the missing devourer of bad souls: Ammit.
3,just fine,"Ordered these for table decorations egyptian themed dinner. Guests seemed to like them! Sparked conversations, colorful etc. Would buy again."
4,Just perfect for my son's class report about ancient Egypt,Length:: 0:29 MinsThis is perfect for my son's class report about ancient Egypt. Nice prop together with his picture board. It made him more interested and curious about the subject matter that prodded him to do more research.It came in a square tube with a latch so you can put them back for storage. There are 12 characters all in all. Each one is described in one long strip of card that contains the literature. The details are adequate and colorful. I like that the plastic used is bendable and not hard brittle plastic.
5,Better Than Enslaved!,"this album impressed me it definetely killed enslaved... but it doesnt nearly touch Fall Into Madness or Where mankind Fails. but those days of steel attack's carrer are over and gone i should appreciate the new ""mature"" sounding steel attackdookie..."
4,Good value for money,"The book has a wide range of music for varying abilities. I am a beginner and I found enough selections to make it worth while for the purchase. Most of the selections are over my head right now, but it's fun to try. Very nice that the book has a spiral bound and will lie flat on the music stand.Great book!"
1,Classical Guitar,First the pieces here are not that Easy. multiple fingerpicking techniques required. Secondly the songs compilation are not the most famous pieces for the classical guitar. Think of 5 Classical pieces you love... then look at this book. They are not found here.
4,"Pure enjoyment, tainted by a few boring stories.","Lovecraft, who probably influenced more writers than Poe, was a genius. His terrible vision of a world controlled by vast Gods with infinite powers shows up in works by Stephen King, Clive Barker, Brian Lumley, and most other modern horror writers. In this book,the greatest horror story ever, The Dunwich Horror, is collected along with The Colour Out of Space, another great tale. Unfortunally, some stories drown under the heavy weight of Lovecraft's highly purple descritions and get rather boring. One can only take so many stories about scholars digging too deep into things they shouldn't be tampering with."
5,Terror at its spine-chilling best,"I started reading Lovecraft as a kid, before King started the modern resurgence of interest in horror. The more ""new horror"" that is published today, the more I appreciate Lovecraft's style, which is of course perfectly represented in this book. For those who prefer terrifying mood and atmosphere, with the height of the terror coming from your own imagination rather than spelled out in graphic, gory detail, Lovecraft is the author and this is the book. For those who are accustomed to the modern trend of shock-value splatterpunk horror, try this book and see if you don't find Lovecraft's more subtle brand of terror to be just as satisfying, if not more so. Absolutely recommended."
4,good,"I bought this for my grandsons school work, he and his mom read it and like it. When they are done they give it to the next years class."
5,Look no further!,"I read lots and lots of horror. I like to jumpfrom author to author, and from one book to thenext. But, the one author that I always comeback to is Lovecraft. I will get on a binge ofhis work for months on end. I never hold on toany of his books longer than a year, though, dueto the fact that I loan them out and never seethem again!"
4,B-r-r-r-r - I still shudder,You got to read this one. The author did an exceptional job - this has to be one of the best sellers in terms of horror. Check it out. Another good book is The Basenji Revelation.
4,Any Lovecraft is Good Lovecraft,"The BEST OF H.P.L is a bit of a misnomer, for instead of witnessing Lovecraft at his best we find him at his most accessible. The BEST H.P.L. to Get Addicted to would be a more appropriate title. But even if a survey is all you can get Lovecraft's fiction is such that, having read him you can never look at reality the same way ever again. The book begins with what I believe ought to have been a Pulitzer prize winning essay on Lovecraft's main theme: heritage (and history in general). Lovecraft's works, the good and the bad, all possess many layers from the abstruse philosophical to campy horror. And in every story it becomes incrdibly dificult to tell exactly where histry ends and fiction begins. You begin to forgive him his overblown style, and then true gems like ""Shadow over Innsmouth"" leap out at you, with a twist better than O'Henry's. This is good beginner's guide however incomplete."
5,Nobody can give you nightmares like Lovecraft.,"If your like me and perused a Lovecraft short story in some sundry horror collection and were driven to pursue more of his frightfully addictive visions, this is the volume to have. Handy collection of 16 of Lovecraft's most terrifying works will fit snugly on your reading table, ready for you to take a mesmerizingly chilling plunge into his domain of otherworldly horrors existing just beyond the corner of our eye. Comes with a splendid introduction and biographical sketch of Lovecraft by Robert Bloch."
2,Seemingly Derivative,"Although I am not certain whether this book became blase through age or imitation, the end result is the same: Lovecraft is rather boring. Every story seems familiar--even his description lacks vibrance or grasp. Sorry to vitiate what is obviously such a cult figure, but an injection of reality was needed among this stash of awed reviews. Read absolutely critically, I would think him a novice. Spend your money on Poe."
1,THE WORST AUTHOR EVER!!!!!!,"H.P. Lovecraft is by far the worst author I've ever heard of. His stories are ten times longer than needed. He spends fifty pages telling you what the grass looked like but one or two telling you about the climax of the story. He uses literary cop-outs like ""It was indescribable"" ""unimaginable"" and ""beyond description"". He is by far the worst writer ever. DO NOT BUY OR READ!!!!And to anyone who thinks that lovecraft leaves it up to you to imagine what something looks like, you shouldn't need to ever buy any book. By your lodgic you could just read the back of the book in the store and ""imagine"" everything else. People buy books like this so they can see things threw the authors imagination, not so they can make things up themselves."
3,"Great, but repetitive","This book is a compilation of short horror stories by one of the foremost horror writers of all time, H.P. Lovecraft. When I first began reading this book I was enthralled. The stories are incredible! They all create an atmosphere of suspense and evil that no one else I have ever read can compare. However, after reading on, I found that the tone and style of the stories was the same throughout, and eventually I ""burned out"" and found the last few stories somewhat boring. It wasn't just the tone of the stories that was repetitive, but many of the stories have carbon-copied characters and villians as well. I recommend this book to any fan of the horror genre or anyone who wants to write horror; you can learn a lot about scenes, characters, and tone from these stories. I would recommend, though, that you read them one at a time with a long break between to keep them ""fresh"""
2,Classic Tales - Horrible Editing,"The tales of Mr. Lovecraft are classic...However, this volume is thin on included works and the editing is just terrible.This volume is not worth adding to your collection."
5,"""LOVE"" it","Lovecraft is the ""non-stuffy"" equivalent of early twentieth-century american horror/bizarre writing. Not to say that he beats the same drum as Poe, but he also isn't so over-hyped. Want a good WEIRD read? Check out one of his collections."
2,Not a Loveable Read,"HP is proof that great plot ideas and great titles do not make a good read. Sorry to say but this was for the most part tediously told and long-winded. Perhaps it takes an acquired taste, or is so antiquated that it can never appeal to the modern reader. However, Poe still enthralls, so I don't agree with the comparison."
2,A praised but flawed work.,"One porblem with H.P. Lovecraft is his writing style. Coming from a time when the style of the day was much more staunch and stuffy, he didn't imbune his stories with the snappy punch of modern fiction. Consequentally, the impact of his tales are lost and the conclusions of his stories come across as anti-climaxes. More importantly, I don't find his fiction scary by one inch. I can read this book from cover to cover and still sleep very soundly, thank-you. Perhaps I'm jaded, but as a horror author, he doesn't impress me."
5,Lovecraft is one of the greats,"When I was fifteen I borrowed this book from a friend of mine. It changed my life. I had never before and never again felt such terror from reading. It was the book that made me want to become a writer. Of course, that dream quickly ended when I realized that I had no talent!"
5,"no ""At the Mountains of Madness""!","This is a great introduction to Lovecraft if you're new to him, with the caveat that it omits what I think is his greatest single work: ""At the Mountains of Madness,"" a long short story. If you've never read any Lovecraft, that story is the perfect place to start and will give you an idea of why Lovecraft is so adored, as well as the kind of stuff he does.But the pieces collected herein fairly represent Lovecraft's best short fiction, with that regrettable exception."
5,It whets the appetite.,"For anyone seeking either a great introduction to the mastery that is Lovecraft, or simply a volume of favorite stories, this book is exactly what you need. As a new Lovecraft reader myself, with the eventual intention of collecting all his works, this collection was perfect for me."
4,A master of horror fiction!,"H.P. Lovecraft is, quite simply, brilliant. His stories can be read on so many levels -- they are wonderful for reading late at night (I can't read some of them when I'm alone at night, they're so scary), and just downright enjoyable for anyone who wants a good scare. But on top of that, his heavy referencing to ancient cultures and mythologies makes his writing something more than simple 'Oh no, here comes the monster' fiction. He represents the elder gods as they must have seemed to the people who once worshipped them: dark, unpredictable figures of terrifying power. This book collects some of his very best stories -- the ""must read"" of H.P. Lovecraft -- all in one very handsome volume.The reason I give this book four stars is because Lovecraft's intricate prose can be too murky for some. His writing does take a certain amount of mental engagement, and someone who's looking for shivers without having to think should probably look elsewhere."
4,Good collection,"All the stories in here are really good (some more so than others due to lack of apparent plot) but what was disappointing was that this wasn't a complete collection. Oh well. Still a decent collection, with some really awesome stories in here, including ones about Cthulhu, Dagon, and the Necronomicon."
5,King could only wish to have such talent,"This is by far the best collection of Lovecrafts tales.If you are new to his writings, start here."
4,The Best of H. P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre,I bought for my son and he has enjoyed it very much. It was a grabber from the start. I am waiting to read if also
2,Mundelein is Better,"My name is Nicole, and i am a student here at Mundelein High School, which this author based his story on. I have to say now, I think Mundelein really is a great school. I cant imagine our school acting the was they describe in the book at all. My older sister went to M.H.S, and she was a freshman at the time this happened. She did agree that Mundelein wasn't as behaived as today, but they were not as rowdy and out of control as the book shows. We are a class-act school, and this book shows us as the total opposite. But i have to admit that its cool to have your school show up in a New York Times Best Seller."
4,everything helpful,"This book is everything a woodworker may need answers for. It includes solutions to questions or issues you never thought you would be faced with. Easy to read, follow, and apply in your workshop."
2,"Works, sort of, but not in a good way","I used to use this stuff religiously. It would completely dry out my face so that my skin felt completely tightened and horrible, so I would put on tons of moisturizer to fix that. I would say it was 80% effective. I still found myself breaking out once in a while, usually on the side of my face that was laying down on the pillow that night. It has the right ingredient (Benzoyl Peroxide) but the concept isn't right. For benzoyl peroxide to be effective, you need to let it absorb into your skin. You can't just wash it off like soap.If you're smart, you will get a benzoyl peroxide gel that you can apply onto your face at night, then put a layer of moisturizer over that and go to sleep peacefully knowing that there is a 99.5% chance that you'll wake up the next morning with clear skin. Do a Google search for ""Dan Kern's benzoyl peroxide gel"" and you will find your answer."
3,O.K. for the time...,"Like several other books, Craig Zirbel's ""The Texas Connection"" hasn't aged well. While he only had one major conference appearance and one major tv show appearance(""Geraldo""), his book was a best-seller, largely due to the Oliver Stone movie ""JFK"" (as was the case with ""Mortal Error"", ""Plausible Denial"" and, with all due respect [I love the books], ""High Treason"" & ""High Treason 2""). Not only is Barr McClellan's book better (and even his book doesn't hold up as well only a few short years later!), the lack of true, rich documentation does this book in. Some intersting info. on LBJ, a few morsels...but not a full course meal.Vince Palamara"
3,Very informative but not without flaws.,"This is an excellent account as far as conspiracy theories go. Well researched and very readable, Zirbel's version of the Kennedy assassination makes some huge leaps and cites many sources that he did not document. It did convince me that LBJ had a hand in it anyway."
5,Excellent book on Editing with FCP for non-beginners,"This book is not for someone looking to learn the basics of Final Cut Pro, the manual and other books are better at that, but this book is a MUST for anyone looking to learn about editing and are going to be doing it in FCP.Other FCP books teach you the program primarily, this book is about editing and the skills and techniques you need to do it well.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,Why is Tom Petty so sub optimized ?,"Being neither a yankee nor a reb but enamored of american ""roots"" music, Tom Petty (with or without) and the Heartbreakers remain maddeningly uneven. Petty obviously aspires to be the bard of traditional heart land America but doesn't quite make it .Some good songs but the majority of the songs are lack lustre and he tries so hard to catch something ""southern"" but it is all too obvious...imitation without conviction."
4,Great album that needs to be REMASTERED!!,"An excellent disc, but one that is in dire need of a proper remaster to do it justice. The sound quality on this CD (which has been out for more than 20 years) sounds thin, because the technology was not available at the time to create the full, rich sound that is now standard.If anyone is reading this who knows someone who knows someone who can get someone to get the job done, please, pass this message along: a REMASTERED version of this disc is URGENTLY NEEDED!!!"
5,Excellent folkish rock,"This album is a classic with a different type of style for Tom Petty. He does some unique, historical pieces. This is one of his best albums."
5,Tom Petty,I think it is one of his best albums and I love every song. It makes me feel energized when I listen to it.
5,Petty's Best!!!!!,"This CD is without a doubt Petty's greatest contribution to rock 'n' roll (only 'Full Moon Fever' comes close to this album's greatness). Folk, rock, pop, country, and raga are blended togerther in a perfect mix. The string and horn arrangements are better than almost everything in rock. But, don't take my word for it, buy it yourself and hear how wonderful it really is!"
4,Southern Accents,"Originally conceived as a double album (but released as a single) 'Southern Accents' delivers another CD packed with that Heartbreaker sound and Tom Petty's unique songwriting and vocals. It is less accessible than other Petty albums but still has some tracks that stand out. 'Rebels' is especially good and although 'Don't Come Around Here No More' is one of the most well known from this CD, it's sound is the most unlike the rest of the album. 'Spike' is a light and fun track and the title track delivers some great lyrics. Overall this is a great addition to any Petty collection, especially as it is so often overlooked. There are better albums to buy if you've not tried Tom Petty before, 'Full Moon Fever', 'Wildflowers' and 'Anthology' are all good starting places, but this album has a great sound and is well worth a buy.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,They really are super simple,"I'm always in search of new patterns, especially those that use pre-cut fabric. However, what these patterns have going for them is their ease in construction. Unfortunately, in my opinion, sparkle and pizazz seem to be missing. I hoped for more from these two veteran quilters."
5,Glad You're Back,"Long time no see. The cd is great and I'm glad you've picked up the pace. You could tell that the heart wasn't in the last cd, but now it's coming back. Get the album, it's tight!!!!"
5,One of the Best,I like it. Even though I don't listen to alot of rap. I liked it! Especially the song DO U? I hear it on the radio all the time with my younger sister. I'll buy it for sure!
5,the best of best,EY man on my momma this stuff is off da chain got ervry album let me tell u tho dis is da dopeness u can sit back and chill ta dis stuff wit yo gurl and have a good time wat can i say erbody in ds chi can rap. representin k-town wat peace cop dis album fo real.
5,"Only MY Opinion, but...","next to Changes in Latitudes-Changes in Attitudes, this is the best Buffett album in the entire 30+ year span of his music. If your job allows it, take it and play it there, you'll be guaranteed a day that goes by at a much more plesant pace. This CD spans the Buffett slant on Rock, Creole, Beach Music, Soul, Ballads and his songs about life in general. If ""No Plane On Sunday"" doesn't tell the best beach love story ever, I don't know what does. Don't forget to search out the Don Blanding book of Florida Poetry which was the inspiration for this CD-""Floridays"""
4,One of Jimmy's better Late albums,"I think Jimmy's better albums were the ones from early on in his career. His albums from the mid to late 80s were not is best in my opinion. However, this is probably his best album from that period, with the album getting stronger as it goes along. This might not be the best CD for someone looking to add Jimmy Buffett to their collection, but one all fans must own."
3,"There are three good ones,the rest are ok except for #10",This album is a great one for all you Floridians out there. Floridays is very likeable and realistic for the natives. No Plane on Sunday is one of my favorites and the phrase is echoed in Jimmy's books every once in a while. I also liked when the coast is clear pretty good. I do not mind the rest of the songs except for youll never work in Dis business again. I havent found too many other takers on that one either.
5,Loved it,"Great C D. My name is Tom from Carlisle, Iowa. Zip 50047. Send any information that you have concerning MR. Buffett. Thanx for the preview"
2,Floristinker,"Floridays is pretty much the lowpoint in the Jimmy Buffett catalog. Outside of the title track & the melancholy of ""Nobody Speaks To The Captain No More"", there isn't much to speak of. ""You'll Never Work In Dis Bisness Again"" lacks the typical Jimmy Buffett humor and ""Creola"", ""I Love The Now"", ""First Look"" & ""No Plane On Sunday"" are dreadful. This unfortunately is a downer for Parrotheads and Jimmy Buffett fans."
3,Flori Dazed,"There are a number of songs on this CD that don't have the feel and vibe we've come to expect from the king parrothead. However, there are a couple of gold nuggets that while not overwhelming, do make this CD a respectable one. Not Jimmy's best, but not junk.Unlike other's reviews, I like the lead off song 'I like the now'. It captures Jimmy's live in the moment philosophy and it has a good rhythm.'Meet Me in Memphis' is just an enjoyable song and you get to witness JB's story telling ability. One of the best songs on the CD.'When the Coast is Clear' is another good song with good music and story telling.The rest of the CD is filler to me. 'Floridays' is just a disappointing song considering what it could have been."
4,An album for all occasions,"Whether I was at the beach, in the garden under my favorite Palm tree, on the nightshift or just driving around this album seemed appropriate. A nice blend of upbeat and slow songs. I even liked ""Dis Bidness"" if I was in the mood. One of Jimmy's best and a real bargain for the price. One star deducted for being only 46 miniutes long."
3,Close,"Griggsby Wright, MD says:I used this book last year in 2003 to complete the final step of the USMLE. I found the passages to be of adequate length, however, I did think the questions from the NMS Step 2 book to be more similar to the actual Step 3 exam."
2,Thumbs Down!,"I would not buy this book if I had to study for step III again. Questions are phrased negatively unlike the true exam format( i.e., All of the following except:). Questions in this book want you to know reference ranges on lab values, I am certainly not going to look up a lab reference range while trying to study in an efficient manner. Overall, a great disapointment."
3,NMS Review for the USMLE Step 3 (Book with CD-ROM),"this book is well written but not good enough for the step 3. the management part is not enough. questions are easy and more look like step 2 and not the step 3. I think it is very good for the step 2 preparetion. I compared this book with crush step 3, kaplan Q BANK, passfirst MCQ, Mosbey's ACE the board and step 3 instant. in one word as a prepared student for the step 3 I do not recommend this book for the step 3 preparation as long as there are better sources."
5,NMS STEP 3 REVIEW,"I liked this review book very much- the questions were well written and the answers thorough. I have tried the Kaplan, Crush Step 3 and think this review book is the best. The questions are reasonable and cover all areas. I would highly recommend it."
3,Ok but not great,"I bought this for my church to run from our computer to our projector (about 35ft apart). We did a test before installing it and it worked great. So we begin to tear down tile after tile to install this thing, once we did it it worked sometimes. The insulation in this cable is very poor so we encountered lots of interference from the lighting which made this cable useless. We ended up buying one of better quality and 3X the cost of this one. However I'm not one of those people that expect the world for 3 bucks so I got what I paid for."
2,Decent,"It's a decent cable, but the cable that ships isn't as thick as the one pictured in the description. For the price, it's a decent buy."
5,What cd's are in this set,I've read so much about what's not included.Could someone give me list of what is included PLEASE!!!PS rating is done because it wont let me post with out it and away there must be enough for me to like any way.
3,"Great, but...","Missing a lot of great albums. It doesn't have Times They Are A-Changing (my favorate folk album), Bob Dylan, Time Out Of Mind, New Morining, The Basement Tapes, World Gone Wrong, and maybe they could have even put in Empire Burlesque. Also they could've put some live cds in too. Hard Rain, Real Live, Before The Flood, Dylan & The Dead, Unplugged all great concerts that should be remastered. A good collection, but missing too many essential albums."
1,got fooled,got fooled...don't buy this - buy the real individual versions. This is digital...not orchestra.
1,Dont be fooled,"I am in a very strange phase of my life where housecleaning can be done only to the rousing soundtracks of John Williams. With the dustballs and dog hair having mounted to overwhelming proportions, something new was called for. To this end I purchased what I thought was a complete set of all three Harry Potter soundtracks. Expecting the crisp, full sound of some philharmonic or another playing the complete William's compositions, I got instead an unpleasant, weirdly muted, boringly repetitive, disjointed disc. Hell if the stuff didn't sound like it was being played on synthesizer. A closer look at the package mentioned nothing of a philharmonic or symphony orchestra, just that the music, although written by John Williams, was ""performed"" by ""Mask."" Avoid this one like the plague. I was duped, and the dustballs will have to remain until I can avail myself of the real thing."
1,i would have given it 0 stars if i could!,This is one of those cd sets you buy at a dollar store. you hope maybe you got a gem expecting to actually get the original score but instead all you get is a synthesised piece of crap! don't buy this just purchase the originals seperatly and used. it's cheaper used and you still get what you always wanted. The original soundtracks by John Williams.
5,Excellent buy,"My son had a Harry Potter birthday party. EVERY child there loved this. The CD's sound wonderful and are an excellent bargain. You get three soundtracks for the price of one. We did miss was the chorus ""something wicked this way comes...."" but other than that it sounds pretty true to the movie verson. No one including the adults noticed it was digitally mastered. We still listen to it often. We love it."
1,Absolute rubbish!!!,"I was so amazed that the title read original soundtrack from the three movies and came at an amazingly cheap price. I ordered it with extremely high expectations and the day i got it,I was jumping with joy. But the moment I had it playing I was so angry that I almost broke my shelf stereo. Its not even close to the original John Williams's score.I recommend that the store stop selling this product as it only fools people."
3,Forewarned,"I have read some of the reviews on this disc set, and most of the bad reviews were because they expected an actual John Williams orchestral performance. This is not that, and I knew it going in. I have been misled before on products I have purchaced online, so I get the outrage factor. That being said, this collection is not bad. It is NOT an orchestra, it is synthesizer multitracked, and really nicely done. Not as enjoyable as the London Phil.,but still enjoyable in it's own way. Product description should be clear that J/W is not in the house, the artist is Mask."
1,stay away from this.,horrible. stay away from this. i felt duped. does not sound at all like the soundtrack.
1,A Fake - Listen Before Buying,"Harry Potter fans beware; these recordings of John Williams' music from the first three Potter films ""performed"" by MASK Digital Recordings are awful. They are not even really performances at all but rather are MIDI playback from a computer with far too much reverb added. It is a crime that Warner Brothers (which owns the rights to the movies) released these.Stay with the individual soundtrack ablums if you want to hear what John Williams composed."
4,harry potter soundtrack,This is a great compelation if you cant find the original plus you get all of the first 3 soundtracks its a great item to have.
2,Not what I expected,"Was not comfortable like an aerosole should be. Looks cheap, the picture doesn't show the thread stitching is on the outside of the pump."
5,My Third Pair,"awesome shoes - this is my third pair of shoes. I wear these to teach in because they are super comfortable. These shoes run big so I would suggest that you order a half size smaller. I normally wear a 9.5, but I wear a 9 in these shoes."
5,So Comfortable!,"These shoes are so comfortable. I bought these shoes because of the other great reviews. I highly recommend them! I normally wear a size 9 and that is what I originallly ordered. They were about a half size too big, so I sent them back and ordered an 8 1/2. They fit great!"
2,"I love aerosoles, but...","I have several pairs of aerosoles, but the first time I wore these, I noticed a small tear in the leather. Very disappointed!"
3,Nice but NOT leather,"I just got these shoes and they are quite nice but the description says leather but the shoe says all man made. I am a bit disappointed with this. I thought I was getting a good deal for a leather shoe and what I got was an average deal. Still, they look good and fit well"
2,Too Uncomfortable,These were too tight around the toes which caused my toes to go into spasms.Even sitting in them did not help.However the sleek appearance gives a very professional look. These should be worn by persons with very very narrow feet.
1,Save your money,"I loved the look of this shoe and I thought they would be comfortable since they are aerosoles. I was so disappointed when I wore these for the first time. Can you say ouch! I am a flight attendant and a comfortable shoe is a must. I wore them a few times to see if it was just a matter of breaking in. No luck, now they are sitting in the back of my closet."
3,So Soft they Break Down,The good news - these are very comfortable heels to wear. The bad news - the material is so soft they immediately get digs and small rub spots that make the shoes look very worn. I wore these for one night (a wedding). I am very short and not the type to kick off my shoes so having something comfortable for the entire time is important to me. I ordered about 6 pairs of shoes from Amazon and sent them all back with the exception of these shoes. I was so disappointed to see the shape the shoes were in at the end of the night. I've returned them and I'm on the hunt again for a pair of nice heels that are versatile.
5,Favourite pumps by far,"I have been wearing these pumps since Aerosoles started making them. I wear a uniform that requires me to wear black patent leather pumps--something no woman should be without anyway. I can walk and stand for hours in these with no pain. After several weeks of daily wear (9 hours a day) the leather stretches, so I order them a bit snug. Absolutely best value that I can find. I have high arches and average to normal foot width and these pumps have been perfect. I hope they never stop making them!"
5,All day comfort in these pumps...even during pregnancy,"Wow, the best shoe purchase ever.I'm in 3rd trimester of pregnancy and my feet have expanded so I have to wear ""wide"" size shoes. Pre-pregnancy I wore 7.5 regular, pregnant I'm 8.0 Wide (C/D).I refuse to look frumpy during pregnancy and needed appropriate shoes for work. These look stylish and are so comfortable. The material is supple so it doesn't cause blisters. The insole is padded so I am able to walk comfortably in them for many city blocks and some flights of stairs without any issues. The heel is just the perfect height, not too low, not too high. The sole is non-slip and I manage the marble flooring of our lobby without any embarrassing falls/slips.I highly recommend this shoe and plan to buy more in my regular size for post-pregnancy."
4,shoehappy,These shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I own. They arrived quickly too. Will probably buy another color soon.
2,Too narrow,"Pretty shoe, but way too narrow. I should have listened to previous reviews and ordered a wide, although I never wore a wide shoe in my life. Had to return them."
3,Too tight for my size.,"Rather disappointed. The size was too tight for me. I have this pair in croc red, and fit me beautifully. This black pair was wee too tight. I need to send the shoes to a cobbler to have it stretched. But otherwise it's a beautiful pair of shoes."
3,"Great comfort, but cheap look and feel","I ordered the black patent and was very disappointed! I ordered them from the areosoles website, so the picture of the patent to me seemed like a flat shiny patent, not a crinkle patent which is pictured here and how they arrived. I was also very disappointed in how I felt like they appeared to look like a very cheap shoe, like something I would purchase from Walmart. I do have to say that the comfort was out of this world! They felt very cushiony, as if I could walk on them all day. The only problem was is that they felt wobbly, not very stable in the heel. Maybe that's what you get when you have that much comfort factor? If it wasn't for the fact that the look was just too cheap and the patent was not smooth (which is what is required for my work) I may have kept them. I also felt that they ran a bit big, I could have gone with a 1/2 size smaller."
3,Aerosoles Envy,"This shoe is a good basic pump for work. l purchased it because it's not easy to find professional looking, comfortable pumps in my size (5M). The shoe runs true to size and the leather is soft. It doesn't provide great support but I can wear it all day without problems."
2,Waste of good broadcast time,"Just more whiney, wimpering pablum from the networks and namely NBC. How much whining can take place in 11 years????? Dwelling on chosen social issues and political correctness got old after the third season. And to top it off just HOW much clooney and his self righteousness can we take."
5,A wonderful tale!,"Reading the description of this movie, I was intrigued; I like ""quirky,"" so I bought a copy, which I enjoyed tremendously. I have since recommended it to friends who also enjoyed it. Give it a try."
4,Fantasy worth watching,"This excellent work seems to start out a little slow as you become familiar with the characters, however you soon realize their relationships are destined to be intertwined in present and past. The director, perhaps unintentionaly, presents the work as a stage play more than a celluloid production, coaxing with little effort chuckles and plot realization. The casting is second to none and the actors are more than believable while captivating your minds eye. I became emotionally envolved with my own life's parallels and somewhat overwhelmed at the delivery of the final message. I found this movie to be a delightful escape and highly recommend it."
5,Beautiful and thought provoking...,"After a much anticipated American release of Dean Spanley I was not disappointed! A must see for any animal lover or lover of life... watch it only when you can with no distractions, then watch it again to see all that was missed the first go round..."
5,Fabulous for Everyone,"How did this movie get overlooked for an Oscar nomination? Big names, great production values and sets, and a story line unlike any other make this a sure fire crowd-pleaser. I have watched it several times and lent it to my friends, and all have loved it. Give it a try!"
5,hidden jewel,"What luck when I saw this on TV recently. I'd never heard of it. Do nothing else while you watch this wonderful film unfold. The cast is fabulous!! What a treat to see many of my favorite actors again in such a fine film. Don't read the long reviews and spoil the ending. If you like fast paced films with explosions galore this isn't for you. This is a mystery but not a conventional one. Enjoy the language, the superb cast, the expressions and the telling of a good yarn. I must own this one so I can enjoy it over and over."
4,You won't forget this one,"You didn't miss it in theaters--not if you're American--because it was never released theatrically here. (It was bought in this country by Miramax, following its European release, then one of the movies held hostage by Disney's dismantling of that specialty division's staff.) It would have been hard to figure out exactly how to market it here, even in art houses, because of its extraordinary tone: hushed, awed, but quite bereft of any of the common American 'entertainment values.' Someone bewitched by the movie insisted I see it, and I'm glad I did; it takes you in, little by little, marvelously sustained, thoroughly literary in tone, and I hope more people see it, because I came away from the experience sure I'll remember it long after I've forgotten most other films. No doubt have to watch it again with my lady and see what she thinks. Hope you check it out too and report back..."
1,Dean Spanley,Dean Spanley DVDThe Dean Spanley DVD is in Italian and my DVD does not accept it !!!Very unhappy to get a Foreign DVD In Italian that I can not even watch !!!
5,A True Gem,"We caught the part of this delightful film last year on Starz. I immediately began searching for the next showing on cable. It stayed locked in the DVR for months until it becaame available in the U.S. It really is the true delight that the others say. It has so any moments of sheer delight ( esp. Bryan Brown's comments ) that it will truly entertain the hell out of you! I rate it in my top ten movies ever, since we watch it every 5-6 weeks. Don't ask, just buy it!"
5,Only 2 comments,I demand that this film be released in NTSC format and if it is not nominated for an Oscar there is no justice in the world.
5,Excellent CD but not worth $100!,"This is a fantastic CD, but no CD is worth almost $100! It really galls me that some people who sell products on Amazon try to ask us buyers for such outrageous amounts of money for something that should cost far less, even if it is an out-of-print item. I sincerely hope that no one will spend what is currently being asked for this item ($99.94). Give me a break!"
5,"Bomb-proof product, tricky installation","This is a beefy, protective skid plate for your XR. I have already taken a couple of hits on it in Moab and it easily withstood the abuse. It shows scratches in its perfect brushed surface when impacted, but that is what it is there for. It is far better than mashing up the frame/motor.It is a bit of a tricky install and may wish you had 3 or 4 tiny elf hands instead of the 2 you will be using to get the clips all in place while tightening them. Other than fitting your hands and clips in tight spaces, it is a fairly simple, straightforward install. It should only take 45 minutes or so to remove factory crash guard and install the new MSR skid plate (assuming you have the tools/torx to tighten the clips)."

4,Sagara West Sundered Series,Happy to find and report that a name doesn't change a thing with Michelle! Sagara or Sagara West her imagination is intact and amazing. I love finding new heroes in new worlds and adore the comfort of falling into the familiar rythm of a favored author. Each of her series' heroes are so different but posess a similar strength. As of now i have bks1&3 and am trying to find 2 so I can get to the end of it. I loved the backstory beginning. It's great to be included in Erin's entire life instead of a few years at war. What lies ahead I cannot say but a princess from a line of magical healers trained as warrior will everyone she loves die or betray her in some way? Thanks for female a warrior who isn't just waiting for a knight to ride in and save the day. This is another magical fantasy triumph!!
5,Loved It!,"I really enjoyed this book. The first half is a bit slow (despite covering many years), but it's important to the setup of the main character. Without it, we wouldn't have such a developed picture of the character of Erin. If the author had jumped right into the main plot of the novel, Erin's time in the Dark lands and her developing relationship with the First Servant, we wouldn't have understood her background well enough to care about her and her struggles.The relationship that develops is strange, disturbing, and hard to understand, which is what makes it so compelling. I really like books that surprise me or aren't easy to predict from the very beginning, and this was one of those. Even though the book is a fantasy and the situations not possible in our world, I found the characters and their emotions and actions to be very realistic.I highly recommend this book and the rest of the series!"
1,You have got to be kidding me,"Did everyone else read a different book? *sigh* I forced myself to read this one because I ordered it Interlibrary loan and it was due back in only a couple of days. Thank goodness I didn't buy it. Perhaps I didn't enjoy it because I just took the book at face value and didn't bother with including an overlying meaning to what the text COULD have mean (I mean, really--in that case we can pretend EVERY book out there has a double meaning).The story flipped from person to person and skipped years at a time in just a manner of a few pages. The reader then had to flip back and forth between pages just to figure out how old, whose talking, what's going on. I perfer my books to flow. This whole light and dark think was confusing. Even the ending and alter stuff was confusing. Again, I had to read and reread just to get the gist of it. Again--I perfer my books to flow.Needless to say, I won't revisit this author."
5,Good start...,I liked this book very much. It was such a good and promising start for a story. The theme is dark love without boundaries or brakes. I could not stop reading. You need to read this book.
1,"Lifeless, boring world","I got almost half way through this book before giving up. There is only the bare bones of a fantasy novel here. The author doesn't bother to develop the setting at all. You get almost no insight in to how these people live, what their culture is like, and what they are fighting for. The main characters are also flat, cookie-cutter archetypes. I couldn't care for any of them. I hear that the book gets better in the second half, but I don't feel like I should have to slug through chapter after chapter of boring, repetitive battles to get there."
2,fantasy,I didn't like this book at all - and I have enjoyed her other series. This was just way to dark and blood thirsty for me.
3,Bad Scan Detracts from a Great Book,"I like all of Michelle West's work both as Michelle West and Michelle Sagara, and I found that this series does not appear to be an exception. The Beauty and the Beast love story (as she describes it at the beginning) is fascinating, and its set up in such a strange way. This said, I do feel obliged to note, for purchasers of the kindle edition, that this is probably the worst conversion to Kindle I've ever paid for. This is clearly done as a scan of the original book, and clearly no one bothered to do a proof-read/spell check after the OCR. It is noticeable and annoying and definitely knocks the kindle edition down at least a star. If you are accustomed to reading OCRed scans, it has that familiar annoying quality, but is quite readable. If you're not, you'll find the apparent typos in this book exceedingly obnoxious, and given that book 2 isn't out on Kindle (but the rest of the series is), I'd be inclined to say its not worth it despite an otherwise great book."
4,What a great book 4 & 1/2 stars,"I found this book in a used book store years ago, and I am so glad I picked it up! It started off rather slow, but as soon as Erin meets the First Servant of the Dark Lord it became such an unsually compelling love story. Most of the book is a dark and rather tragic romance between Erin and Lord Stefanos. They can't help but be both repelled and fascinated by the conflicting nature of the other, as they find themselves compromising what they've always believed in to be together. It took me years to finish the series because books 3 and 4 are so expensive, but if you can get your hands on them, I recommend all four- they don't disappoint. These are the types of books you can't let go of even days after you finish the last page."
5,One of the best bands around,"The musicianship on this album alone is worth enough to check this cd out, but I have to say that riddle of steel has definitely found a good medium between creating very catchy riffs and ALSO using unusual time signatures, weird chords, and the like. Anybody who likes any post-punk, post-rock, whatever you call it will like this cd but I think this band has the potential to reach out to wider base of fans based on the difficulty of describing their sound, as relatable to a certain genre of music. I've also seen them live twice and that is another reason they are so good, they pull the stuff off live just as well as on the cd. Check it out folks."
2,Not the best collection.,"When I started listening to this CD, I was surprised that I found it devoid of the energy I associate with Jimmy Buffett. His newer material (both studio-recorded and live albums) have an enegry that is lacking in this older collection.If you enjoy a more mellow JB form 20 years ago, or if you just like him for his radio hits, this is the album for you.But if you're into the hard-core, serious partying, spontaneous, energetic JB, if you call yourself a Parrothead, skip this album.I recommend _any_ of his live albums or ""Meet Me in Margaritaville"" instead of this one. You'll be getting more music for your money, anyway."
3,All a non-Parrothead will ever need,"Buffet's clever lyrics and tuneful songs are well-represented on this ""Best of."" His weak voice is carried by the quality of the songs but after a while there seems to be a sameness about his song topics and you realize he sings about the same things over and over. But he does it well. If you are so inclined there are many CD's by Buffett, but this one is probably all you'll ever need or want."
5,Jimmy Buffett CD,As advertised and timely reception of CD. Good seller and will do business again if necessary.
1,Not again,"I've gotten to where I hate summer because everywhere I go I hear these insipid excuse for ""songs.""""Margaritaville,"" is easily the most ubiquitous of these, but amazing, as obnoxious as it is (and believe me it is OBNOXIOUS) it is not the most annoying (close though).That honor goes to that ode to adult maturity ""Why Don't We Get Drunk,"" the sentiment of which gets even more specific than even the title indicates.These are the songs that make me long for winter - and I live in Maine people!"
4,"It's ""heaven on earth with an onion slice""","This very c.d. was my introduction to becoming a Parrothead. My sister had heard some of the songs from a friend and kept singing what little words she knew of the songs. Finally, I got the c.d. because I wanted to hear a professional sing the darn songs. From the first song to the last song (""volcano""), this c.d. is a pretty good Buffett compilation. Very few slow, melodramatic songs (except for ""He Went to Paris"" including the infamous line ""and it left Jim with only one eye""). This c.d. always reminds me of going to Myrtle Beach, watching the peers, and seeing the people having fun, fishing, and drinking.Each song is a gem, but I gave this 4 stars because there are more great songs that buffett has made beside these. I felt that this should have been a 3-c.d. set.Nonetheless, a great artifact for Parrotheads and a great introduction to a great, screwed up man!Also reccomended are ""Living and Dying in 3/4 Time"" and the live video."
5,Perfect recipe for summer,Step one: buy this cdStep two: buy new blenderStep three: buy lots of rum and fruit mixesStep four: mix the rum and fruitStep five: pour the mixture into a glassStep six: put on the cdStep seven: repeat steps three through six as often as neededIf you don't drink alcohol then you'll still enjoy this greatest hits collection. All the early hits are here and it's really all you need to know about the guy. But there is a lot more good stuff out there. Make sure you give it all a listen.
5,An absolute essential!,"This album is one that everyone should own. It's a classic, and it's an absolute essential. Jimmy Buffett is the undisputed king of the musical genre he created. Listen, enjoy, and visit his world. You may never want to go home."
3,Not a full bite,"Jimmy Buffet is one of the few artist in my opinion that cannot be measured in a ""greatest hits."" To be honest, I feel Jimmy Buffet shouldn't have a greatest hits. His music is like chapters in ones life and each chapter (album) is a journey. The album, High Cumberland Jubilee, contains many great songs not on this cd. The song, ""Ace"" is a great window into the soul of Jimmy that a greatest hits cd will not open up to. Also, the song, ""Cowboy in the Jungle"" off of, Son of a Son of a Sailor is impeckable to me and also is not reflected on this cd.Jimmy is a true artist and is worth a complete listen and not a snapshot. Margaritaville is only a appetizer into the feast that Jimmy has created over the years."
5,Great Gift Item,"Need a Gift for a Jimmy Buffett fan, and they have a CD player in their car?This is the item to get !!!!!!!Totally amazed at how little I knew about Jimmy, I took a punt, and bought this as a gift for playing in the car on CD, and wow... totally appreciated.Absolutely ideal for the Jimmy B fan. This and a Hawaian Shirt will do just the trick !!!!!"
5,Sit back and relax with Buffett,"This is one of my favorite CDs. It's perfect for parties, beaches, and just chilling at home. Highlights include 'Volcano,' 'Pencil Thin Mustache,' 'Come Monday,' and of course the keg party anthem, 'Margaritaville.' Very enjoyable music."
5,This is a great album!,This one album has all of Jimmy Buffett's best. His lyrics provide an interesting view to the real world. This is a great album for new fans and old ones.
5,Give this album a chance!,"Jimmy Buffett is more of a state of mind then an artist...but if that is true, I want to have part of the state of mind! He seems like a guy who is always having fun. But to tell you the truth, I like all of the songs on here except track #9 (check the listing yourself! ) Some of the better songs are those like ""Son of a Son of a Sailor"" and ""A Pirate Looks At 40"" that have more profound messages than, ""there's booze in the blender""! I also like the reminiscent ""Pencil Thin Mustache"" that describes a guy looking back at the way it used to be! All in all, this is a great album! Congratulations Jimmy on the world-class party album!"
4,"How I Rate ""Songs you know by Heart"" by Jimmy Buffett","I've always enjoyed listening to Jimmy Buffett and since hitting a few ""Margaritaville's"" in different parts of the country and joining in with the ""salt, salt, salt-"" I found this album very enjoyable."
3,Decent Sampler,"Ok, I'm really sick of Margaritaville, Cheeseburger in Paradise and Fins. But the good news is those are really some of Buffett's lamest compositions. Before he became a favorite of people who know nothing about music, he actually wrote some pretty cool quasi-country tunes and more or less invented the idea of crossing Nashville with Key West. So, Son of a Son, Pirate Looks at 40 and some more make pretty great listening. He's got a lot of that stuff buried on his first few cd's, the ones that today's annoying 'parrotheads,' i.e., suburban Midwest drunks, have probably never heard. With all those riches, I don't know why Jimmy doesn't reissue this thing greatly expanded, with remastering, much needed, and at least double the amount of music on here. Buy this, but also check out the early Buffett and forget the self-parody that he became over the past 25 years."
4,"Great Book, But No Real Pictures","This is a great book. I've found it very helpful in planning my cuttting garden. The only point that surprised me a bit was the lack of photos. There are hand drawings which are nice, but really don't convey what the flowers look like. I'd love to see a new addition with a directory of photos that corresponds to the text. Regardless, I do recommend the book."
1,What's with the bindings?,"I am bookseller and I see hundreds of books a day. What is with DK's bindings? They are either dropping pages, or split, or some other problem. Is this ""planned obsolescence""?. Come on. Get it together. We use like a pint of glue every year just fixing these bindings."
4,Good book; kit requires some patience.,"First, I must admit that I broke the rules. This set does indicate on the box that it is for ages 8 and up, and I bought it for a seven-and-a-half-year old. He desperately wanted a robot kit and I couldn't find one for kids under 8. So I can't really complain that it was complicated for him and he needed a lot of help putting one of the robots together. He did enjoy the book very much; in fact he is under the bedcovers reading it with a flashlight as I type. This kit has big ""wow"" appeal at first glance. The little pieces require patience to sort. A big plus: the step-by-step instructions are printed on sturdy colorful cards that are much easier to manipulate than pages in a book. The resulting robot is a bit flimsy and doesn't ""eat"" things like it's supposed to, but it did satisfy my son's desire to build a robot."
2,Not 5 separate robots,"Just to clear up a misconception ... this does NOT make 5 separate robots, but rather, 5 different robots one at a time. You have to reuse various parts. The product label is misleading."
3,Its an ok kit,The kit was some what educational. I think that the parts were too cheap. I made almost all of the robots and the only one i liked was bounce bot because of the object avoidance technigue.I think that the kit should have had real electric switches.It takes alot of patience to build the robots. I hope the author who made the kit uses the better parts next time he makes a kit.
1,"Rubish, don't waste your money","The packaging and promise of this kit to build ""robots"" just didn't live up to its hype.The pieces are flimsy and don't stay together, the makers obviously never did testing to watch people try and put this together. I worked hard to do this with my seven year old and the first robot we built didn't work or even stay together...A complete waste of money."
4,Swedish flag,"The yellow color was a little to orange. Flag is thin, so take it ineach day and do not use on windy days. O.K. flag for the price."
1,Ingemar Johansson,Hij Sverige......BEWARE!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I was very dissappointed when I received this flag in the mail. It's as thin as tissue paper and equally as see through! If you buy this flag you are allowing yourself to be ripped off.TakHij Do
5,50 hits is enough to start you off in the right direction.,"This relaese, originally released in 1985 to commemorate 50 years after the birth of Elvis Presley, went double platinum a short while ago. Each song on this fantastic release is quite a gem. It gives a little variety of Elvis' musical talent. The rocker, ""Hound Dog"", the romantic, ""Love Me Tender"", from the heart, ""If I Can Dream"", the love songs ""Can't Help Falling In Love"", the movies, ""Blue Hawaii"", and so much more! I was excited to get this years ago. Excellent song choices with very poor packaging. On a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being the best): Packaging = 2, Sound Quality = 4. It might be a little poor in those areas, but a must-have to start your Elvis collection."
1,Real Programmers Don't Want this Book,"I really enjoy the Using Series, and look for them whenever I want to learn more about a certain topic. However, this book is deplorable. It is not made for anyone looking to write their own code, or anyone who actually wants to program. All this book tries to do is show you how to use someone else's code. I do not mean another module, such as the infamous CGI.pm moudle, but rather using another script and ""tweaking"" it for your needs. It also does not seek to explain the theory behind the code. I was also quite disappointed in how it was organized. The Using Seies are good books, but this one doesn't belong in the family. There are much better books out there that will serve your needs."
1,Pooly written with incomplete examples,"I found this book to be hard to read and poorly written. The examples are very difficult to follow because most are only code segments not the full code. This makes it very diffcult to follow. As any experienced programmer will tell you ""Nothing helps more than a good example."". This book is highly lacking of good examples. I have several years of experience with programming in several languages, which allowed me to fill the gaps in the examples, how ever a beginning programmer would be lost. In conclusion I do not recommend this book to a programmer of any level."

2,breaks easily but good for little thumbs,"I have been through 8 of these bells for my daughter's scooter. They break easily: when you press too hard, when the scooter falls on them or when the bell is too tight. But they are the only bell that works for children under 4 years. Little thumbs aren't strong enough to push the lever on standard bells. And of course my daughter loves it, which is why I have gotten it again and again."
1,cheap,"The bell doesn""t work.It doesn't fit on the radiofler tricycle handle,too loose.would not recommend this product even though it was inexpensive.the shipping also was expensive for this little bell."
1,Wrong Color,The quality seems fine. The size is fine. All is as I ordered except for one thing: It is green not red like the description said. Too late to return for Christmas now so I will have to give a green one to a kid who wants a red one. Disappointing.
2,Poor reostat design,"I have seen two of the Horton 3 dot scopes go bad. You have the ability to dial up between 0 - 10 for different brightness. As you dial...they should click into place when going from 1 to 2 , 2-3, etc. Both have lost the click in ability and on occasion you have to push down on the dial to get the scope to light up with the dots. They were good for the first 25-30 uses and then went bad."
1,Horton 3 dot crossbow scope,I have a Horton 3-Dot scope that came with my crossbow. The up/down sight adjustment just stopped working. Shoots the same place whether you screw it all the way in or all the way out.Called Horton and got nothing but the standard warrenty response. Currently searching for another brand.
2,Same Problem,"I had the same problem with the dial on my Horton 3 dot scope. It was in the middle of hunting season yet at that. It got to the point where I had to put a piece of electrical tape over the dial to get it to work. Not something you want to be bothered with when you have deer coming in. Tried to contact Horton, never received a response to e-mail or phone call."
5,A Magnificent Recording,"I have to be honest: I don't like all the recordings I've produced. This - James Sedares' performance of The Magnificent Seven - is superb. Even the composer, a conductor himself, called this recording definitive. The complete score stands as a compelling and memorable tone poem of the Western and despite the fact that all was recorded in a too brief four hours, the results are nothing short of spectacular. After finishing the sessions, my wife and I did the obvious thing and went horseback riding in the Arizona desert."
4,Great Western sounds,"Utterly enjoyable music, well played and recorded. The ""main theme"" is, of course, unforgettable. The rest varies greatly: some passages are hauntingly beautiful, while others are less than gripping (as expected for a movie score; the music shouldn't steal every scene, after all). A few of the themes are surprisingly derivative of Aaron Copland.Still, a very worthy purchase."
1,One Important Fact Left Out,"This product does not work as described, not for me anyway. Here is my important fact: One must be strong with good dexterity. Use the hand guard as you place the potato on the slicer and hold it with one hand as you use the other hand to tilt the slicer up on one end, then attempt to push the potato down the slicer while keeping it tilted and through the coarse blade which has been adjusted to its widest possible setting. If the potato doesn't fall off or you drop it and you accomplish the slicing, you will find that it has sliced your 'fries' into french fry shaped hash browns. The adjustment did not go any wider so we fried them anyway and ate potato sticks."
1,I don't hate it.,I returned this item as it was not quite what I expected and found something else that was easier to use.
3,This book is a bit dated...,"It does have a bit of good information though, but it's definitely dated."
5,This is the ultimate guide,"Tony Caputo has put together the ultimate guide to publishing your comic-book successfully. As the successful publisher of SCORN and SNAP through my company, SCC Entertainment (http://members.aol.com/SCCENT), I can say that I continue to use this book as a publishing resource and would recommmend it to any aspiring publisher.Chris Crosby, Co-PublisherSCC Entertainment"
3,"Informational, but not to helpful.","Caputo gives a general idea, based on persoanl experience, of what it is like creating your own comic book/characters. His information is enlighting if you have no idea about the process, but is far from being definitive. He merely gives a general list of steps one MAY take and lists addresses to contact for more information. It is okay if you need the information and have the money to spend. Otherwise, just keep searching online or your local library."
4,Wonderful and Educational,"I have learned so much from this book. I can tell you that this is a tool, and not a way for Mr. Caputo to line his pockets. I am very grateful that he took the time to enlighten us all. We have a chance to learn from his mistakes and flourish due to his success. I have read, enjoyed, and have learned from this book. Thank you Mr. Caputo, and I for one hope you do more books."
3,Check it out at the library.,"It was a good read, but it didn't have absolutely everything that should've been in there. It was too vague on many of it's subjects. It felt as if it really should've put it's foot down and gave specifics in certain areas.It is were cheaper, I'd give it a better rating."
4,"pretty, but lime stones fall out easily",This belly chain is really pretty. But when I received the item there were some lime stones fall-outs. Tried to glue them back but it's not easy to do and it made the lime stones look dimmer. Be careful when handling the chain because the lime stones do come off
4,Buy this! Good underground mix....,"Opening with the twisted nu-skool of General Midi's ""Daft Funk""and touching on sexy techfunk, tough house, and even techno, this is a good cd for someone who likes variety in their electronic beats. Traylor did an excellent job of selecting tracks that don't get old after repeated listens, this is one of my most-listened to dj albums. All the tracks have a certain dark sexiness to them while staying funky. If you like Meat Katie, James Lavelle, or even Digweed, check this out."
5,Insightful view of how our economy will work in the future,"After reading Daniel Quinn's Ishmael and The Story of B, and now The Ecology Of Commerce, I am forever changed. Paul Hawken's book provides excellent examples of how we can move our current economy towards sustainability. I truly believe that his ideas will come to light in the up-coming years. This is a great book."
5,A Good Overview with Practical Solutions,"Many books on the ecology of our planet tell what's wrong for most of the book then have a chapter in the end on what we can do. What I liked about Hawken's book, which many consider to be the classic on growing our economy and sustainably in terms of our environment, is that it is chock full of great examples of how companies have successfully altered their practices in light of ecological concerns. And the counter-intuitive thing is that, with creative problem solving, it can actually be more profitable to be an environmentally friendly company or society. A little dated at this point, this is still a great place to start if you're getting into books about sustainable living."
4,Solid but not the complete picture,"The author, co-founder of Smith and Hawken and several other ventures, brings to light the inevitable conflict between ""business as usual"" and environmental and social sustainability. After this analysis, he posits that things needn't be so gloomy; rather, with proper encouragement from government and a committed citizenry, business can become a force for positive change. My two cent critique is that the author's solution counts on drivers external to business and does not explain what steps would lead to creating these drivers. In other words, we can easily picture how things could be better in a world run by the likes of Paul Hawken but how do we get there from here? I found the book a worthwhile read, inspirational and fact-filled."
4,Thought Provoking,"I had to read this book for a class. I found it to be very thought provoking, but a little short on substance. Hawken raises many questions that I think need to be answered concerning the business and the economy. However, he often doesn't provide any solutions himself. When he does offer solutions, I was left wondering, ""Just how is that supposed to work?"" This book is definitely worth reading because it provides a new perspective on business.I think Hawken raises some important questions in his book, and I wish more business people would read it."
1,pocket atlas themebook,"a poor text. Very confusing diagrams with an odd numbered key. You spend so much time looking for the key, thay you can't even get back to the anatomical structure that you were reviewing. Compared to a ""Netters"" text, this is junk. It is a shame that Dr. Netters is deceased! We need his diagrams and plates in pocket format!!"
1,The book is poor...,"Mirage is a poorly written book about the interaction between the main characters and their social environment around them. I would have appreciated a more informative and imaginative work of fiction dealing with Saudi Arabia's cruelty in its modernity. Compared to A Nector in a Sieve, which handles the same core concepts of poverty, love, economics, etc., Mirage failed in its attempt to convey such messages by not building the story line properly. Towards the ending, the actions were rushed and unbelievable. Overall, the author failed to educate and engage the reader in this dramatic depiction of gains and losses in a religious, unequal society."
4,Chaos - .... - Violent Intrigue,"Mark Rogers writes a heady mix of sword/sorcery, .... and political machinations unlike anything I've found in decades of reading. In Hollywood high-concept parlance, you could say Karl Edward Wagner's Kane meets Machiavelli in the Kama Sutra, mixed with odd religious overtones. I have several of Mark's paintings hanging in my house and they ooze the same tension of .... freedom and impending violence that his writing puts into more specific terms. Other reviews on this page will give more of a plot line; I just want to recommend for the stout of heart, that this is a series worth reading. I only give it four stars because you do need to read the first two books to fully enjoy the ride. Nicely demented!!"
5,Holy cow! Another masterpiece!!,"I've been following this gentleman's work since I ""Zorachus"" in 1986 and am constantly amazed that, somehow, he keeps getting better. ""Night of the Long Knives"" is connected to the Z books and the ""Expected One"" trilogy and brings a type of closure to those great works, and in such a seamless way that he must have had it in mind all along.All the usual Roger's perks are in full display--the action, the style the cleverness and cosmology--but with new twists that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat. I LOVED IT AND BET YOU WILL, TOO! Where else can you get a philosophy lesson, a good laugh and a belly full of top notch violence? Buy this book and send a message to the Fantasy world that Mark Rogers is back and is taking no prisoners!"
5,More good stuff,"For those of you that have read Mark Rogers before you should know what you are in for. Filled with wizard priests, warriors, action, sex, fantastic battles, monsters, religious and political disputes, this book is nothing like a typical fantasy novel. Such depth and imagination are put into each character, each one is fasinating. It is well written with the words painting the scenery and action vividly in the readers mind. And if you completely lack an imagination of your own, the book is filled with art done by the auther. The artwork alone is worth the price of the book. Night of the Long Knives is the 3rd and final book telling the story of Zancharthus. It is a very fun read and well worth taking a look at."
4,"Looks Good, Great Quality and Functionality","been using it for a while now, nice style, good functionality, easy to wear. It's a little bit smaller than it seems to be in the pictures though, still not a big deal in terms of appearance."
2,poor buckle,The buckle keeps coming undone on the part that is suppose to stay fastened all the time. It is hard to get the belt back through the buckle. The part that is suppose to hold the belt just pops up. The other side where you are suppose to tighten the belt works fine
3,Lower quality than Columbia,"I purchased this product in hopes than it would be equivalent to my Columbia belt in quality, since the Columbia is no longer available in Navy. However, it is somewhat narrower and lighter in weight - certainly not what I was looking for. The belt is ""OK"", but I would not purchase again."
2,Narrow belt,"Not seller fault, i should have read the item's description.I would say, this is more for boys rather than men's as the belt width is pretty small."
4,Great belt,This is a very great belt I'm pleased that it fits me and is comfortable. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because I the buckle itself looks kinda cheap but it works! :) great price as well!
5,Excellent value,I purchased this belt to wear with my Dickie's shorts and it fits perfectly.The belt looks much nicer than in the provided picture andis an excellent value for the money.I received the belt within the estimated time.It was well packaged and arrived undamaged.I am very satisfied with this purchase.
2,a little short,The belt was smaller than I thought it would be. One size did not fit all in fact it barelly fit me and I'm not that big.
1,Cheaply Made,"This belt didn't even last 6 months. It is already in the trash. The buckle didn't feel strong and the webbing of the belt was thin. Should have figured from the price. Very poorly made, spend more money on a better belt."
4,Great all around casual belt. Feels high quality.,"Purchased the black Dickies web belt.Sure, it's a belt. It either holds up your pants or it doesn't. So, reviewing this item on if it did the job it was meant to do... they it's five stars. It holds up my pants. Bonus: It also holds up my shorts! So really, its double the value.It is made of strong durable woven cotton and has a fairly thick metal buckle with the ""Dickies"" logo on it. Never was quite sure of what the deal with designs on belt buckles were. I guess to draw they eye...? Anyway it looks good, is strong and is fully adjustable to any size at all since it isn't a notch-belt. I knocked one star off because while the metal buckle appears strong, it does feel slightly cheap. Love it. I want a red one now. Because real, for under $8 bucks who wouldn't want to sport a bright red belt?!"
1,JUNK!!,Got this from UPS in a very timely and quick manner. BUT..... wore the belt for 20 minutes and it broke. Yes it was only six bucks so its not really worth the time and effort to return it. Guess I'll be buying another belt somewhere else. Thought Dickies would make a good belt since most of their other products are tough and durable. But no. Not the belts apparently.
3,The metal end is a little thing,I'm used to wearing these belts with an Air Force uniform. The metal end stick out enough without showing any of the material. It also keeps receding into the buckle portion.
5,Best Book On The Subject Because It's Down To Earth,"As a Career and Life Coach I have been attempting to grasp the concept of creating money using spiritual concepts. I have read many books on the subject but they always left me with the question, ""How do I do it?"" Cody's book is very down to earth and lays out the information in practical terms that really make sense. Finally I ""get it."" I have started working with the principles in this book and I can tell you that they really do work. She lays out the informaiton in a very practical way so that ANYONE (especially me, with such an analytical mind) can understand. I am so excited about this book that I am creating workshops to help others, using her book! If you have read other books on prosperity or wealth and they are collecting dust on your bookshelf, --donate them to the library and pick this one up! Diana Hart, Hart to Heart Communications, Inc."
2,"Too Metaphysical, Not Enough Practical Information","If you like to write affirmations, ""visualize"" yourself as wealthy, and do a lot of ""thinking"" about being successful, this is your book.If you are looking for practical steps to achieve your money goals, look elsewhere."
2,It was lousy,ok lil romeo was a fase for me but he is okay and its not the fact that i dont like him anymore that brings the album down even when i liked him i thought it was a bummer.The songs on the album mostly are about his old friends and his life it was enjoyable the first 2 or 3 times actually listening to the words but music and beat wise was poor.I dont even listen to it anymore.Its not awful but by far not great.But he is 11 and writes his own music i respect that!
1,Busted,"Lil Romeo is just biting off Lil bowwow and lets face it ....hes no LiL bowwow. I f I could meet him I would say ""B ya self and get them gigantic ears fixed"" This is Lady C and it aint true unless you heard it from me."
1,This [is not good],"I'm not ""hating"" on Lil Romeo but COME ON. He's 11 years old. He sounds so ... young all you can do is laugh. My Baby is okay because the beat is nice but his ""rapping"" needs to wait a little bit. His career is going to be over when his voice changes. He looks like a ... puppy dog. How is he supposed to be cool and tough when he looks like a puppy. ..."
1,What was Percy thinking?,"What did Master P ever see in his no-talent moron son? Seriously I know that No Limit was falling off a bit when this kid came on, but P should have used the money he used to produce and market this moron to market and produce his other artists. This bubblegum trash and this kid has got to be the worst rapper in the history of hip hop. If you want to hear some good rap from the early 2000s get Eminem's ""The Marshall Mather's LP"" and the Three Six Mafia's ""When The Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1"""
2,Lil Romeo and his debut self-titled album,"Even though Lil Romeo's cd is the best,Lil Bow Wow is still in and making new songs.Songs like ""When I Get Grown"" by Romeo,Is expressing feelings inside.If You like Lil Bow Wow and Romeo,You really shouldn't choose against them.They are both great rappers and doing their own thing.Bow Wow is not receving a wake up call.He is cute and so is Romeo.The only thing that is between them is Bow Wow isn't making any fame off of his dad.He is making off of his self.As for Romeo,Well.......He making it off of his dad.Really,He is.Romeo should be able to make it off of his self,not his dad or uncle.And Bow Wow is more experience ""In The Rap Game"" instead of Romeo."
1,???,"Your ABCs? We don't want to learn English, we want rap. Good rap! Lil' Bow Wow, P.Diddy, Lil' Jon, Petey Pablo, Black Eyed Peas. I mean come on. Do you really want an ABCs CD? Get real rap, not Language Arts. That's why they have something called a school."
2,Lil' Romeo,"First of all, he copies off of everyone elses beats and lyrics too much. And his lyrics and beats are still but though. That is all I have to say."
1,romeo sukz,itz hard to think dat romeo is master p's son... And romeo sayz hez rich when itz actually his precious daddy who gives his money to romeo!!! Romeo is stupider then he looks!... if thatz even possible...
1,(Bad),Well first let me say that he got one star because he had enough courage to put out some trash like that. The album is beyond terrible. I should have known that it would be hot garbage from seing him perform. He lip sincs and he has no stage presence. He IS ADORABLE but that is about it. He yells through the whole album and the songs are corny. He needs to take some lesson from LBW on how to rap cuz his daddy can't rap either. Also the little boy has hair extensions. But I recommend that you all go buy LBW'S new CD Doggy Bag. It has hot tracks produced by JD and the neptunes and the raps are tyte.
1,you call this music,this was whack not good at all lil bow wow was better then lil romeo anyway. lil romeo can't really rap and masterp did'nt really help at all so this album was just garbage.
1,Little and Untalented.,Yet another clever scheme by the master of pitiful music to sell records and make more money.I cant beleive a father would exploit his own son just to make more money off him.This little kid cant even rap and all the lyrics were written by his dad.The beats on the album are way too simple and probably stolen as his dad is known to steal off of others.There are real problems in the world and all this kid can rap about is how rich he is and how cute he is. just look at the cover and track listing and youll see what i mean.
5,lil romeo is the top lil rapper,lil romeo .... is the best preteen to teen rapper.he is so adorable.between him and his father they are going platium. ....lil romeo is keeping it real.
3,It Could've Been Better,"Lil Romeo did a preatty bad job on this cd. i thought the tracks would've been better than the MY BABY song. But i am looking forward to his next cd, because i love the way he kinda changed 2 way to put it in a more modern version. i think Romeo's first cd was just something he mixed together for the fun of it. i really am looking forward to his next cd, Game Time because i believe he will have changed the way he sings, and matured a little bit. In that case the beats will be faster, and i might be able to relate more. As for his first cd he should've tried harder."
1,Master P is Going Down The Toliet & Guess Who He's Taking?,"11-year old Lil' Romeo does NOT write his own rhymes, is not a gangster, and is just a puppet of bubblegum rap. How can actual people like this s--t? Lil' Romeo & Lil' Pow Chow are exactly what's wrong with rap today. They should be in the pop section for little kiddies who love Barney and the Mighty Mighty Power Rangers. No Limit is the worst label in the world, and it's just got even worse (no one thought it was possible!). Go get this kid a diaper and get him off the mic, already..."
1,Oh my,"This CD falls into the category of being so bad its not even worth reviewing. But since I find it horrifiying that Master P now uses even his own son to sell records, I figured I'd add my two cents.Basically, its the rap version of the backstreet boys. Oh, except that unlike Romeo, the backstreet boys don't sample Jackson 5 songs and demolish them for quick hits. The music is actually more well constructed than a lot of No Limit garbage, but not enough to actually redeem the album. The corporate music industry has a tendency to appeal to the younger crowd more and more, but this is just ridiculous. 11 year olds should be in school, not out redoing a bunch of retro hits to make money for their fathers."
1,pure garbage to the 10th power,"How can anyone spend 20 dollars on this piece of trash? This is NOT music. Rather a little boy who attracts elementary school girls with corny lyrics that makes Britney Spears looks like the next Janis Joplin. Do yourself a favor and buy historic albums like Illmatic, Low End theory, Reasonable Doubt or anything at that level. Romeo has to be one of the most horrible rapper ever."
4,sweet,"bout this toy as a addition to my collection of figures and am satisfied for the most part. very detailed and looks very cool but has a few problems. first the helmet just sits on the head and slides around very easily, i have this placed on my computer table and everytime the table is bumper the helmet falls off. with that exception it was a great buy and a great additon for any spawn collector"
5,"Lovely, Likeable Book","Because the book really maps out a clear development of thought, its many little imponderables can be easily overlooked. To understand field theory in its historical perspective, one can't do much better and it's easy to do far, far worse.Now according to Dr. Diane Davis Villemaire (of McGill University...an association that is always a good sign) ""In the last analysis, it was a personality conflict with the discipline that made him glad enough to leave it to people like A. Rupert Hall and L. Pierce Williams, history of science professor at Cornell during the 1960s."" (page 193 of E.A. Burtt, Historian and Philosopher). I don't see any conflict with this book of L. Pierce Williams and Burtt's Metaphysical foundations of physical science. None whatsoever. In fact the two book beautifully dovetail each other in my mind."
4,Woodlands is highly recommended!,"Robin Jones Gunn once again pulls off a winner. I really liked this book a lot. It's a little less exciting than some of the other ones she's written, though. I think there could have been a little more interaction with the characters themselves. Plus, I would like to know more about Alyssa and Brad, Shelly and Jonathon, and the other previous characters that are only quickly mentioned in this book. It's still a great read and worth every penny. I absolutely LOVE this author!!! Good job, Mrs. Gunn!!!!"
4,Welcome back to Glenbrooke!,"Once again Robin Jones Gunn makes us long for this sleeply little town! She does a great job of introducing us to Leah and Seth, updates us of all the characters from the first six books and puts it all together in a fresh, wonderfully told story. She even solves a mystery from Secrets, Book One of the Glennbrooke series! If you liked the other six, you will love Woodlands and long for another trip to Glennbrooke. Oh, just so you know, the scripture reference should be 3:17, not 3:1.....what Chapter? Grab a Dove Bar, read the book and see! (ps to Robin - you can tell you live in the NW, you describe the weather perfectly!)"
2,Pretty Good,I liked this book but didn't feel it was as strong a read as the others i have read. The weakest of all the glenbrooke novels to me is clouds but that's just my opinion and other people i'm sure feel differently. This storyline is a little weaker than the other novels but the characters are likeable...i think that leah is a little too pushy in her character in that she seems to pursue seth more than he pursues her in the beginning which is not the way i would do it but it's still worth a read...
5,My favorite in the series!,"I thought this was the best book in her series because Leah seemed so much like so many people I know. She was such a giving, loving person-beautiful inside and out, but did not feel like she was. So when she meets a wonderful man and he sees her beauty it is so sweet. She had so many negative voices from her childhood, especially the ones referring to her name, to overcome to accept love that it was an inspiration to me."
4,A good book,"I really like this series. Woodlands is not my favorite, but definitely worth the read. I liked this story. It's always a treat catching up with friends from previous Glenbrooke stories. I felt that Seth and Leah had too many misunderstandings between them. They didn't trust each other, which hurt the story in my opinion. The lack of trust between the 2 main characters was the reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5."
3,expensive and cheap,"The probe works great. However, the tip is very fragile and it doesn't take much for the metal band that detects temperature to split. Once it does the probe is useless. Not sure why it costs so much for what it is. You can buy the more expensive metal probe but it still has problems with the band and is it is almost 3 times more expensive. I have used both."
5,A Solemn Yet Emotional Album,"Some may say that because this is a piano solo album, it is rather dry. However, Andre Gagnon has the talent to bring out the pain and emotion behind every note in all his pieces. It really allows a listener to appreciate the multiple tones of piano solos. I enjoy listening to this album thoroughly."
1,Not actually the Swiss flag,"Just FYI to people who are looking for an authentic Swiss flag, this is not it. The Swiss flag is square, not 3x5 proportions. This could pass as the Swiss Naval Ensign which is rectangular...but it's a stretch, and you won't see the ensign flying anywhere in Switzerland.I can't comment on the quality of the product since I didn't buy it, but thought you might appreciate this info before you purchase."
1,Incredibly Inaccurate. would not let me give no stars,Horribly inaccurate flag was sent to me. The picture was correct but the flag was way off scale.To top it off customer service for this company consists of an answering machine and after 3 messages still no return call.The product was less than $10 so I am not going to pursue this but if I had paid $20+ and the customer service had not called back I would Be completely livid and irate.This company sucks.
5,good addition for advanced play,"I don't use this to enter and solve entire puzzles, but it works fine for that also. I use it to do advanced puzzles and find 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 (aka x-wing, swordfish, jellyfish) combinations."
3,Different. Very focused on himself.,"Yep! This book reads kind of like a personal journal. Everything starts with I. There are other books out there that are better. Samauri by Saburo Sakai, Gods Samauri by Mitsuo Fuchida, Emperors Sea Eagle by Zenji Abe to name the 3 best. In other books about aces this guy is not mentioned. One source on the inter net gives him only 1.5 victories while he claims 17. I know this could be because of bad record keeping or because after a while units kept only unit scores. The usually kept tally in their log books or notes. I recommend buying one of the other books mentioned."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for advice on setting up a trust, trying to keep attorney and other fees as low as possible. This book certainly does not do this. The recommendations of hiring an estate attorney, a financial advisor, and other advisors to form a team would probably eat up my entire estate. For me there are much better books available"
5,"""PILOT X"" aka ""Murder in the Sky""","A phantom WW-I ace, bearing an ""X"" on his flying leather helmet, raises havoc and terror by popping out of the clouds and shooting down fellow flying aces opponents, many times after a fierce ""dogfight"". Who is the phantasmagorical killer ""Pilot X"". Do not miss this rare and old time air war drama starring John Carroll of ""Flying Tigers"" fame and co-starring Lona Andre. One of the best ""B"" movie films of the 1930's, produced by low budget studios ""Fanchon Royer Pictures"". I highly recommend it."
2,"Bad copy, and below average serial","The premise is good, and I like the old serial cliffhangers... but this one is difficult to see and hear, surely there is a better copy somewhere that they could have transferred to DVD. The ""action sequences"" make the old Buck Rogers special effect (the OLD Buck Rogers...) seem amazingly advanced (if you remember the droning space ships that wouldn't fly exactly straight and the smoke would drift up and make the wires show) compared to this one.I'd pass on this one and look for some of the later flying serials."
2,A hit and miss book on Billy the Kid.,"This book was written by a ghost writer for Pat Garrett and set the stage for future Billy the Kid authors. The book is fictionalized in many places in an attempt to make the book flow better and to make the book more interesting. But, since the book was co-authored by Garrett, succeeding authors used it as a reference thinking he knew the kid well. But, Garrett did not know Billy as well as he led people to believe. The really good things about the book are the areas talking about Garrett's own experiences. But, the reader needs to be careful and not believe everything they read in this book. It could hurt them when reading more factual accounts of Billy's life in the future."
5,:-o,"Ok, so I don't have much experience with French pop.. but goodness this is a beautiful album. I first heard of April March when a friend gave me her Chrominance Decoder album, and from there I had to find more. The sound is amazing to me, and I make music all the time. Bertrand Burgalat's got one of the coolest sounds I've ever heard.I don't even speak French! But I love listening to her singing in English and French just the same. This album is an odyssey. Get it and listen through it start to finish!"
2,Book is good but,"This book is great & gives you the insight of ""C++ templates"" but for beginners even advanced C++ programmer who want to start templates please DO NOT buy this book at first sight...go for STL Programming by Herbert Schildt. This book assumes you already KNOW templates VERY WELL."
5,a real complete guide,"I like all those description and examples: the topic may be complex, but really an interesting thing when enjoying it slowly."
3,"Fun, that's about it","While some might have this blasting 24/7, I found that is CD is only necessary every so often. It's nice for background music. But with newer remixes of the same songs, I found this kinda dated. Maybe I'm just drawn toward techno/dance music, but this is still a nice cd for those that like the originals."
1,Scam Alert,Beware of this guy....he will send you unwanted videos and keep charging your credit card $70/month month after month....no customer service to respond to complaints ...will report this scumbag to better business bureau
4,The 80's are back with a vengeance !,Not as listener friendly as Vendetta on Sunction records. Still this will appeal to fans of early New Order/ Depeche Mode just like Vendetta will. Not to mention that the packaging is very Factory Records Peter Saville looking (think of Joy Division's Closer LP and you'll see what I'm saying). With more tracks on this release brings out one drawback-more tracks to experiment with which in turn means more tracks to skip.
2,Don't waste your time on old technology at this price,"First of all, the image shown is incorrect -- the Braun 7526 does not have an LCD display. Only the 7680 model does in the 7000 series.Second, this model is now several generations behind the latest Braun shavers. There were some drawbacks/imperfections that have been addressed in the later models.Third, the price listed for this model is actually higher than what you'd typically pay to get one of the later models.Fourth, this was the first model to introduce the cleaning station, and so it has a couple of design flaws. The most notable issue is that there is a lock down tab inside the unit that easily breaks after a year or two of use, making it impossible for the cleaning station arm to lock the shaver into place. Braun abandoned this design in the next version, smartly eliminating the arm and putting charging ports on the back side of the shaver unit.Don't waste your money... buy the later 8000 series shaver by Braun. You'll be glad you did."
5,Front Mission 4 Review,"Awesome Game for Strategielovers!This game is awesome for everyone who loves Strategygames or Turnbased strategy. At the same time it has a really neat story and it gives you the possibility to completely customise your gear and inventory of your characters. The Mecha setting might not hit everyones taste, but its still an awesome game.I love it!"
5,Great game...if you have the time,"This is a superb turn based strategy. he graphics are nice, the amount of control in customising your units is great. The story is weak, but if you ignore that the game itself is awesome. I recommend this to any strategy buff you owns a PS2."
5,"Tactical RPG fans, go for it","Front Mission 4 is the best the series... well maybe except for 5 which I haven't play.I really liked Front Mission 3 on Playstation, but the difficulty was really hardcore, FM4 is still difficult but a lot more accessible, the gameplay is basically the same with more combos, weapons and obviously much better graphics being on PS2, the story is once again about politic and war between country, with a very realistic storyline in a futuristic world.This is my second favorite tactical RPG (Final Fantasy Tactics is still the best for me) and I wish the fifth episode came out in the US, for now I will contempt myself to play this game again and wish for a Front Mission 6 on PS3."
3,Worst Square / Enix game I've ever played,"Square Enix is the gold standard in quality games, but this one is a huge let down. The graphics are crap. The story is pointless, and worse, SLOW. But the real sin here is that the gameplay is so tedious and un-fun. Wish I could say it was better.... but its not. Might be worth $10 bargain bin purchase, but even that is questionable."
2,front mission 4 boring,"this game is good but after a while it gets very boring. The certain squares u are able 2 move sucks, and way 2 mush talking in the game the little talking heads wont stop poping up. but is is rated teen so maybe teens think better of this game."
4,Christmas gift,"The sale price was excellent making this purchase a real winner. The glasses are very elegant looking. The top of the glass is very thin so I would suggest not putting them in a dishwasher (wash by hand). These wine glasses were one of my wifes Christmas presents and she is very happy with them--that's what counts.Again, great service from Amazon.com"
1,I think we're not talking about the same glasses,They are pretty but they feel like paper. I purchased based on the reviews and I am thoroughly disappointed. If you attempt to do a toast with these they would shatter in you and your guest's hands...
1,This is garbage,"This garbage is not worth owning. The writer is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The author or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these books. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."
3,A Needed Item That Costs Too Much,"If you have the old style 4 prong phone outlets scattered around your home and want to use newer phones with modular jacks, this is the fastest way to go. Just plug in the modular plug from the new phone into this adapter and then plug the adapter into the old outlet. Simple and easy to make and way over priced. But cheaper than having a phone expert install a newer modular jack where there was an older 4 prong."
5,Old technology but it works,This is the type of device that works or doesn't work. I've installed it in my mom's house and it has been working for 2-3 months now.It converts the old style phone outlet (4 female holes) into the modern day phone jack.
1,Shipping & Handling gives this product a 1 star rating!!! My $0.02 rant,"Before I piss & moan about the shipping & handling, let me first say that Sanus makes the best wall mounts on the market.Now... how can anyone give a positive rating on a product who's packaging was horribly damaged? I had to take pictures becuase my colleagues wouldn't beleive me if I simply told them.When I came home, all of the small parts were lying outside and around the box, with the main bracket lying flat on the ground. One can only assume that when UPS dropped it (or threw it) on my porch, they most likely drove off with the missing parts from the wall mount. Honestly, I don't know if the box was damaged by UPS or Amazon, but I've read other's posts that it is Amazon who is careless."
1,Worst I ever spent,This book is bad. Grammatical errors all over the place. 75% of the book was general business info. In the appendix there's some info on starting a bookkeeping business.
4,"Great, but watch out for errors!","Overall this is a very helpful book for quick study and review. Be aware though, I am about 1/3 of the way through it and have already found a few errors. They have been on relatively minor details but it worries me what else they may have gotten wrong that I have missed. I am not suggesting that I know better than the authors (I am a relatively new student). These were things that seemed wrong to me as I read them so I went to the big Barash and confirmed that I was correct and the Handbook has it wrong. A couple examples: on page 223 the Handbook mixes up the definitions of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. On page 326 the table mixes up the drugs that induce or inhibit P450. These things are correct in the big book. I am concerned that someone might make a clinical decision based on false information."
5,Moses,"It was a well loved childhood book I just had to have in my ""elder"" years.It was a used book from a school library on discard but the content is still good."
4,Piano pleases,"I got this CD because of the title track - ""Fred the Cat."" The music is lyrical, incorporating many themes and styles from the Caucasus and Armenian traditions. Hovhaness writes well for both the piano and orchestra (""The Mysterious Mountain"" being his best-known composition)and I enjoyed the flow and variety of the music on this CD. Fred must have been quite a cat!"
3,Casio Waveceptor Watch,The watch comes with instructions that are VERY difficult to follow and will take some time to get the watch set. Once the watch is set it works very well and looks good although the blue face would be easier to read than the silver face.
1,Nacos strikes back,"The Nacos (Mexican rednecks) are back. I'm really sick that in the place where i live, all the people listen this kind of music. i listen all the songs as the same. All the songs are from people who fall in love, and after them are wasted or dismissed. This kind of music is one of the reasons that the american people hate mexican inmigrants (and i hate either, altought i'm mexican)."
4,Funny and silly,"I read this book to a group of preschool children at storytime at our local Zoo. When I first read it to myself, I thought it was a rather silly book, but the children thought it was wonderful and couldn't stop laughing. I would recommend it."
5,hard to find lotion,"I have been using Palomma Picasso perfume and lotion for over 15 years, and I can no longer find it in department stores, THANK YOU AMAZON!"
5,Thanks for waking me up!,"This book has changed my life. Living in white suburbia I've been asleep for a while and this book opened my eyes to find out who I really am, how to understand my people and how to do educate myself, my family and my people. I will used this book as a reference for raising my two boys so that they can be proud of where they come from and prepare them to to conquer the racist obstacles that they will face while growing to to be strong educated black men."
5,Know Thyself,I received the book in excellent condition and it was timely shipped. It's a thoughtful analysis of what is needed to properly educate African-American students in the United States. It should be read and discuss by all interested in education.
2,Not for FPGA Design,This book is not helpful for synthesis at all. Do not purchase it if you will be doing anything related to FPGA or CPLD design. It may be helpful if you're doing simulation only.
3,An okay Kit but gets the job done,"I'm not too impressed with this kit since the TTL Flash Cord is not a very good quality connector and has a very flimsy release pin. What if that pin breaks off? Without the release pin it'll take some effort and tool to remove it from your flash mount. Also, for some reason I sometimes lose connectivity between my flash and camera so the flash does not sync or fire as expected. I then have to turn off both the flash and then the camera, remove the flash cord, re-connect it, turn both units back on and test fire.The bracket itself was just what I expected and so far it has been very reliable. It's a good solid piece of metal and good foam grip.I would suggest you buy the bracket and then a higher quality flash cord separately. The total difference between the kit and buying it all separately will only be $10 but you'll get a higher quality flash cord and you'll much happier in the long run!"
1,Don't Buy It,The bracket is fine although a little hard to store in your bag. The cord did not finction in ETTL mode with my Canon Rebel XTi. It could well be that a wire was cut but other reviews on this cable also indicated failures. The return with the seller was easy and w/o any problem. I recommend that you purchase the Canon Cable and not waste your time or money on an off brand.
3,Good bracket..horrible cord connection,"I bought 2 of these about 3 weeks ago (1 for me and one for my partner. Mine worked fine right away but my partner spent 2 days trying to get her cable to work properly. When we finally did get them both to work, mine was nudged by a guest at a wedding and my flash fell off the top of the bracket. It was properly mounted but the pieces are only plastic and very flimsy. Unfortunately I was screwed the rest of the night as I did not have another cord.Buy the bracket but save the headache and get a better cord with a professional and reliable connection. Dont let what happened to me happen to you."
3,Get This CD,Well the cd is not that bad. Got Collaboration with Tank in the song Tonite i'm yours. Seems Like Zane is LL Cool J wanna be. He dropped some nice verses in the Album which i aint mad at him.Its a chilly album so i guess some ladies might like it.
5,This CD Rocks!!!,"I love Merle Haggard. I've even seen him in concert. The problem is he has God knows how many albums, and his greatest hits cds rarely include the tracks on this cd. The whole thing is good. It's one of the only cds I can listen to the whole thing over and over."
2,Not that good,"This is the prettiest of the three Ginger Snaps movies, with a bigger budget, a more styalized look, a polished feel, and better werewolf FX. But on a story/script level, it is the worst.The Ginger/Bridget story is a rehash of the original movie: Ginger gets bitten by a werewolf (this time a child), and Bridget fights to save her from the curse and to hide it from others. Just swap out the ""puberty metaphor"" from the first film for ""Native American mystical mumbo-jumbo,"" and replace the drug-dealeing helpful guy from the first movie with a Native American hunter/tracker, and it'll all feel real familiar. The outpost-versus-a-monster story has been done many times, and thus doesn't hold much interest; the characters are all obviously werewolf fodder from the start.If you've seen the first two films, this isn't a terrible film. But after the quality and inventivness of the first two, this one disappointed me greatly."
4,Not quite on par with the first two,"I agree with the reviewer that said that this movie is not quite as good as the other two. The sets and the historical flavor are well done, and Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins definitely know how to act. But...I think that my main gripe with this film is that it's all been done before. Ginger gets bitten, Ginger changes, Bridget tries to save her, blah, blah blah. It seemed almost like a rehash of the first film and I couldn't really get into it.This is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of the first two movies. This movie does offer interesting insight on how this all began. Another thing that I liked was that Katherine Isabelle had a much larger role than she had in ""Ginger Snaps 2, Unleashed."""
2,"Weakest story in the entry, best production however","Personally, I am huge fan of the first 2 films, with the second film being my favorite. I thought this one had the best production, but had the weakest script. I didn't really care for it at all. Also, I think Emily Perkins overacted in the film. Her facial expressions were too extreme. She was perfect in part 2 though."
3,Enjoyable! Certainly worth watching!,"Although I enjoyed Ginger Snaps Back - The Beginning, and wouldn't have missed it for the world, I found it to be too much like the first. Something was missing, but I couldn't put my finger on it. But the setting, and the actors and supporting actors were fantastic."
4,A very original werewolf movie!,"This film has good costumes, great characters and an appropriate atmosphere. Despite the colonial theme there is nothing hokey about this film. I would say this is definetly the most original werewolf movie since Dog Soldiers and maybe the most original since Silver Bullet."
5,Nice,"A cute film, not really importan to the other Ginger movies, but a must see none the less. I want more of these."
4,Ginger Snaps Back,"This third movie is a great addition to the series. Although it has nothing to do with the other two in terms of timeline, story, etc. the movie still stands well on its own. The scenery is very beautiful and the entire feeling of the movie is eerie and has a good atmosphere. The story drags a little bit 3/4 of the way and the other male characters get to me sometimes. ALso, this lacks the humorous scenes found in the first Ginger Snaps. However, the girls (Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle) are still amazing and I love the strong sisterly bond. Costumes are also great. Definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the series."
3,Ginger Snaps 3: The Beginning,"This movie didn't make any sense. Yes I've seen the first two and enjoyed them both equally, but face it, if this is technically called ""the beginning"", shouldn't it have been in the first movie? Think about it; Ginger gets bit by a werewolf and gets killed in the first one, and in the second Brigitte gets the curse...so how is Ginger alive in this one? Flashback, most definitely, but if that's the case then why don't they mention anything about the first two movies in this one?!"
3,GINGER AILS,"Not having seen the second movie in this trilogy, it may be inappropriate to fully assess the impact of this prequel. Set in 1800's, GINGER SNAPS BACK is a beautifully filmed movie. Director Grant Harvey's use of lighting, colors and costuming is marvelous, lending a truly eerie feel to the proceedings. The special effects of the werewolves is substandard, but the movie doesn't rely on them to provide the terror. As in the first film, the relationship between sisters Brigitte and Ginger is outrageously close. In this film, Emily Perkins' Brigitte isn't as forceful and dominant as in the first; Katharine Isabelle is beautiful and a capable actress. The film did seem anachronistic at times, with modern language (the f word, 'prick') seeming out of place. The cast of lesser known actors is also very good. I plan on viewing the second movie in this series. As for this one, it's effective and competent film-making, and whether it actually ties in to the other two, I'll have to wait and see."
4,Three for Three!,"This third installment of the Ginger Snaps Trilogy really doesn't seem to have any connection to the first two. It's more of an ""Elseworlds"" concept, placing the Fitzgerald sisters into an alternate time and locale.That said, this isn't simply a rehash of the first two films, but an original story with a pleasantly surprising ending. Well-shot, highly atmospheric, violent and suspenseful, this movie (like its predecessors) stands head and shoulders above almost any other werewolf films out there.Very well done. I really must spend more time checking out low-budget Canadian horror."
1,"Horrible, just horrible!!!!","Okay....They are in the wild west, with cowboys, indians, and werewolves. I just can no longer stomach any movies that stereotype Native Americans as hardcore super warriors and mystical wizards. Stick with the first two and avoid this one like the bubonic plague."
1,Stop the MADNESS!,"When is this trash gonna end? This whole franchise should've been stopped with the first film quite frankly. The first ""Ginger Snaps"" was nowhere near a horror classic, nor was it all that great, but at least it was worth watching once. They just couldn't leave well enough alone. Like so many other movies Hollywood has to flood the whole genre with a whole bunch of crappy and pointless sequels. This is definitely in that category. They ran this mess into the ground with ""Ginger Snaps Unleashed"", and I can't believe they had the nerve to make a sequel to that. Not only that, they have to take us back to the so-called beginning. This has absolutely nothing to do with the first film at all. It's a movie all on it's own, which only proves they need to stop it with the sequels. Sequels on top of sequels seems to be the Hollywood way these days. With all that being said, if there's any justice in the world they will stop torturing us with all this madness."
1,"One Star, but darn good","This is the third movie in a great trilogy if you just want to watch really bad horror movies.The first movie had me laughing my butt off, this one was slower and on a higher budget (which makes it worse), but it was still pretty funny.If you want a real horror film, don't watch this movie. If you want a stupid horror film to laugh at (think ""Scarecrow Gone Wild), you'd like this movie and love the first one. They are so bad, you have to keep watching them over and over."
4,Dead Man's Party G,"Great dance CD, the song Dead Man's party is a great dance song for your Halloween Party!"
4,Dead Man's Party,"The CD has two of my favorite songs, 'Dead Man's Party,' and 'Weird Science.' The rest of the CD quickly grew on me and now I can't think of not having it in my CD collection. When it shipped it didn't take very long for it to come in, I'd say about a week. It was in great condition when I got it and the disc itself looked brand new. Thanks a lot, and keep up the great work."
3,Older is Better,"I disagree that DMP marks ""Boingo's finest hour."" On the contrary, DMP marks the turning point of Oingo Boingo from a vibrant and original ska based sound to bandstand pop. Not only did DMP mark the deterioration of the previous vitality of composition and execution into canned big studio sound, but lyrics dulled too. DMP is characterized by the droning repetition of song titles and otherwise highly forgettable lyrics. Think back to ""Capitalism"" on Only a Lad (""you're just a middle class socialist brat from a suburban family and you never really had to work ... what the hell do you know about suffering in pain?"") - not profound to be sure, but at least articulate.Don't get me wrong, I'm a die-hard fan. I just think Good for Your Soul, Only a Lad, a great little EP (if you can find it) with the original ""Violent Love,"" and my personal favorite Nothing to Fear represent the band when it was great and that DMP and its successors do not."
3,"A decent Boingo album, but not their best","I like this album, but it's not great. It's was not up to par with their previous 3 (or 3.5 counting their first EP) efforts. There's some great tunes on here: Dead Mans Party, No One Lives Forever, but a few tunes sound like filler...or perhaps just reflect a mellower side of the band that seemed to take hold after this release. I would have given this 4 stars, but THE CD RELEASE SOUNDS HORRIBLE. I bought this to replace my old LP that I bought when the album first came out. The CD has no low end, and sounds like your listening in a cardboard box. My old vinyl sounds better that what they pressed on this CD. I REALLY hope they remaster this CD someday...it really needs some help."
3,Cool muzik!,Since viewing 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' Ive looked for the soundtrack but to no avail found it. However one song on this record ('No one lives forever') is included and thus made me happy to once again hear it. As well as that is Weird Science which is also a cool soundtrack. Danny Elfman never fails to deliver quality tunes. Nice one.
5,"this album is a ""must-have""","This album got me hooked on Boingo, period. They use the best balance of horns, keyboards, and guitars out of all their albums. Every song is upbeat, creative, and very addictive. Elfman showcases some of his best songwriting skills."
5,dead man's party,"oingo boing was the best band of the 80's...it's the perfect 80's sound.my favorite songs are ""dead man's party"" and ""stay""i love danny elfman's voice too."
4,Great Value,This Screen is 120in diagonaly. I have it paired with an Infocus X2 projector with 1600 Lumens and it works great unless there is direct light in the room.
1,arrived damaged,"The screen arrived damaged (thanks!) and when I called the customer support number and informed them about the damage, I never heard back from them. Very frustrating. I don't think I will be ordering from them again.D.O. in Cali"
3,rash guard,"The overall size is smaller than other rash guards I've purchased of the same size. The neck size is unusually small which makes it difficult to put on and take off. The fabric is thinner than my other rash guards and feels like a lesser quality fabric. The thread at the wrists has started to unravel, after minimal use. It has never been in the washer or dryer, so I wouldn't expect it to be falling apart."
4,Good Framework & History,"Provided great understanding on the history and sociology leading to how and why Americans are the way they are and act daily. I found this extremely useful in feeling comfortable in my interactions with Americans during meetings, business lunches, and casual meetings. Helped to level set my expectations relative to my own upbringing in a foreign country."
5,Great Guidance,A great way to get the right feeling of what works and does not in Working with Americans. Thank you
5,Valuable business guide,"Not only an easy and enjoyable read, but also a highly informative book which gives valuable advice on how to maximise business relationships between Europeans and Americans. A must-read for all those intending on doing business that links the US with Europe."
5,Must Have Resource,"Managers from both sides of the ocean will benefit from immersing themselves in this corporate survival handbook. Sensible advice for doing business with Americans. An easy to follow, intelligent format looking at historical and cultural contexts and covering all aspects of this tricky and often glossed over endeavour."
4,A Handful or Two of Good Ideas,"This book was recommended in another book on facilitation. I did find several good ideas, and have since used some of those with good results. Like another reviewer here, I found the comments about what not to do and mistakes to avoid helpful. But I had hoped for more. Like other reviews I've read elsewhere, I found the 21 list framework a bit gimmicky and distracting. Overall, it was worth the price, though better books may be out there (but I still haven't found what I'm looking for ... at least in newer books). I have found a few older books, like ""How to Make Meetings Work"" and ""Joining Together"" just as helpful."
2,"Though not mentioned in the description, this isn't a video","I was expecting an actual video, but this was just a PowerPoint-type presentation burned onto a DVD. It pretty much only consists of many jpegs with narrative audio. Although it was fairly interesting, it wasn't worth the premium price at all."
1,Bad DVD,I found the DVD nothing more than family slides and not worth the price. The narrator had poor diction and mispronounced words. For the cost you would think a professional would have narrated.
5,Very Nice Sweatshirt,"Was extremely pleased with this item. Ordered this sweatshirt for my USC student for Christmas. It is very attractive, heavy, and very well made. I'm betting it will be very warming to my son at the tailgate parties and games."
5,Exceptional read,"It was hard to put down this book because as I read on it revealed intriguing concepts related to self development, but it was done in a pleasant, enjoyable manner,not in the form of a dry management development manual. Bits of precious knowledge were dropped amidst narration about exotic travel, romance and adventure. I cannot wait to read the author's next book ""Smarter Than Snakes."""
2,"""You Remind Me"" sounds a bit like Dylan's ""Buckets of Rain""","Has anybody else noticed that part of the tune of ""You Remind Me"" is exactly the same as a portion of the tune from Bob Dylan's ""Buckets of Rain"" from his 1975 album ""Blood on the Tracks""? The similarity occurs at the words ""We could die just sitting here, a wayward heart a broken tear..."" in the Poltz song and at the following words in the Bob Dylan song ""Buckets of rain, buckets of tears got all them buckets coming out of my ears..."""
2,Not what I expected,"Working with Visual Studio 2005 Team System is less about working with it and more about what it is and what it can do, and even that is not more than a simple outline, just the top of the mountain. I guess I expected more How To's and less what it is. That information is everywhere on MS websites. So I am still looking for some details on how to get it done."
3,Brief Introduction; Not a How to Use!,"About the same stuff that was in the Give away from Tech Ed / PDC 05. If you have that version save your $$, if not only buy if you are looking for a ""what is"" Team system Book NOT a hoe to use team system."
1,useless,The book does *not* tell you how to work with VSTS. It's a summary of marketing blabla praising Microsoft for what they haven't invented at all. Almost all the info has been used when VSTS was announced in 2005.There are many MSDN articles really telling you how to use VSTS. This book is *not* for IT professionals. For example it does not contain a complete example starting from requirements analysis to integration testing.If you are paid for getting software out the door - look somewhere else for VSTS info.
5,Great Overview of VS 2005 Team System,"If you are looking to find a great overview of the entire Visual Studio 2005 Team System suite, then this book is an excellent choice. The book will definitely help speed your understanding and appreciation of Team System and all that it can offer. It shows how the Team System features can be used to ensure successful software development effort in an easy to understand and thoughtful manner."
2,a reader from California,"The English translation can be improved, as the Chinese version is much better."
5,Amazing Collection!! Patriotic Music all on one CD !!!,"This CD is definately for people who are looking to get some uplifting patriotic music for listening to at home, the office, for parades, barbecues, and ecspecially holidays like the 4th of July. Its got all of America's greatest hits including ""The Star Spangled Banner"", ""Amazing Grace"", ""America The Beautiful"", along with other less well known gems such as ""Godspeed"", and ""Pslam for Band"". All of the songs are played excellently by the US Marine, Navy, and Air Force bands. The label that put out this release, Altissimo Records actually specializes in military music, so if you like this check our their other releases. Overall Highly Recommended!!!"
2,A Matter Of Sex.,"""A Matter Of Love"" only contains five actors. Mrs. Mays is the friendly yet ditzy owner of an oceanfront timeshare. She accidentally schedules two different couples to occupy the place during the same week. After some initial confusion, the two couples decide to share the place.One of the couples is happily married and they have very liberal views on having as much fun as possible. The other couple's marriage is in trouble. The wife isn't feeling loved by her overbearing hubby anymore.The movie provides an occasional interesting glimpse into the reasons why people sometimes lose the spark in their marriage. Of course, being a Chuck Vincent film, the focus is more on nudity and a swinging lifestyle rather than any deep introspective look at relationships. Mildly entertaining."
5,Awesome,The product is helping my cat with her anemia. Fast and efficient service from the vendor. I recommend for anyone who needs a supplement for their pet.
2,Just Ok,"I have a 3 year English Bulldog. He has an allergy to gluten, so his food is made at home. I was hoping to add this to his food in hopes it might put some additional pep in his step or improve his coat, tear stains, etc. Honestly, I see no difference in behavior or in the way he looks. Perhaps this works better for other breeds or in other instances."
3,Why is corn syrup the first ingredient?,"I bought this product at a vet's office that a friend uses. I had previously purchased Hi-Vite drops from my vet for $10 for 1 fl. oz. dropper bottle. Since the vitamins seemed to be helping my dog, I was pleased to see this big 4 oz. bottle that looked very similar and was priced at $9.00. I didn't read the ingredient list until I had used it a few days, and corn syrup is the first ingredient. Sucrose is the third. Do our animals really need sugar in their vitamins? My dog is diabetic."
2,Pfizer could do better for us.,"I'm in complete agreement with the pet owner who objects to the corn syrup base of Pet-Tinic. There is no reason that a cat or dog--especially an ailing one--should have to ingest this much sugar.I actually went so far as to taste it, and it tastes like classic green cough syrup with iron in it. I would bet my savings that Pfizer simply repurposed one of its anise-flavored human cough medicine bases rather than spend money on formulating a quality pet product.My vet recommended Pet-Tinic for my elderly cat with anemia. I'm impressed by the reviews here, but I am also concerned with the acidifying effects that this much sugar might have on her system. I'm actively seeking out an alternative iron supplement for her."
5,Very pleased!,"I have a kitten who has had medical problems since birth. Numerous times she was touch and go; not sure she would make it. She is doing MUCH better now, but was still not thriving as her other siblings were. Within a week of starting her on this suppliment, as well as giving her a daily dose of Catlax which this same vendor sells, her health seems to have already improved! She seems more bright-eyed, has gotten bigger, stronger and has more energy! I am now on week 2-3, and I cant be more pleased!Will definately buy again!"
5,Helps My Kitty Keep Her Iron Level Up,"This was recommended to me by a specialist I brought my kitty to when she was quite sick. Among her other issues, she was very anemic, which explained her low energy (in part). Now, with this, in conjuction with a few other things, my 16 1/2 year-old baby is doing much, much better (knock wood, salt over shoulder). She's playing like a kitten and is the HBIC as usual. She gets 0.5mL/day and likes it enough to not make a big deal about having to take it. If you have a cat, you understand what that means. Great product. I highly recommend it."
2,Not sure this is of the same quality as the botlle the vet sold.,Our cat loved this until i replaced the vets bottle with this bottle purchased online. So I question the actual ingredients or product within the bottle.
4,pet supplement,purchased this item on the advice of a friend.I am not sure yet if it does what it is intended to do.Dog must have blood test in order to know.
5,Life Changing Insight,"I never thought of Joy as a requirement, always as an option.What do you have to lose? There is so much to gain."
5,My favorite for years!,"Zagora has been one of my favorites since high school (when all we had were cassette tapes)! I was browsing to find a better deal on a CD than my local music store. Buy it. Listen to it. Swoon with it. The best track - ""You Can't Stop The Rain"". Oh my GOODNESS - cuddle up with your man on that one, ladies!!!!!"
4,Dynamite followup!,"Zagora has some dynamite grooves! I still love Stay a Little While Child, which Mariah Carey did a remake of with Jermaine Dupri, so it's still a timeless record. I liked Slow Down when it was a hit. But I definitely love the very smooth and mellow You Can't Stop the Rain, which still caresses under my skin every time I hear it. So beautiful an R&B ballad from the '80s. The rest of the album still continues with the funky grooves and surprises!"
3,GOOD--NOT GREAT.,"A lot of the songs on this album (as well as their others) are not that great.""Stay a little while"" & ""Slow down"" are great, however.Nick Martinelli's production is tight (although his earlier records, circa 1982, were much edgier)...the vocals, however are the weakest thing about this group.I simply do not like Jane's tone, and Carl isn't a strong vocalist either.Most 80's british soul had awesome production, while the vocals usually paled in comparison to it's American counterparts.DR. FUNK"
1,True soul Classics,"Zagora is the album that Put Loose Ends on the map and best defines the London based Trio. Not only is the sound both cutting edge and soulful,the blend of Jazz makes this album a true collectors item.To all who do not know Loose Ends please get to know them,this group put UK soul on the world map and paved the way for all other acts following. P.S. Look out for gonna make you mine - A b-side gemLoose Ends we thank you"
4,Good Quality,This is a beefy mount for your projector. The mounting screws are kinda cheap. Make sure that you drill pilot holes to the full depth before trying to screw in these monsters. If you don't you will never get the screw buried to the full depth. Easy to adjust and stays put once tightened. Comes with a lot of pieces - so be prepared. I thought that it was easy enough to put together.
4,Great product,"Very flexible, yet very solid. Just what I was looking for. I have my projector hung from a wall and it works great."
4,Ecellent Economy Mounting Solution,"I found this mount when looking for an economy mount for my classroom at school. A strong and stable mount, it has not moved since we installed and aimed it. My one concern is that the product shipped without instructions, but our school engineer who had hung mounts before had no problem installing it. ZIf not tfor the lack of instructions, it would have easily gotten 5 stars!"
4,Easy to install but takes time to adjust.,"The installation is pretty straight forward. However, adjusting it, as one reviewer had mentioned, can be tricky. When you begin to tighten the allen screws, the arm tends to move in the direction of the turn. Also, tightening one axis sometimes jolts the other axes as well. As a result, I've had to just nudge the arms a little even after they're tightened to get them to position correctly. However, when all said and done, this is an extremely good mount. In fact, is is the only one I've found that was able to move my projector forward in the direction of projection."
3,Universal front projector mount,I got the product relatively quickly and it works as intended however I think if this is sold as an universal mount it should come with way more assortments of screws and washer/spacers in order to accomodate most projectors. Also the joints could use some lock washers in order to prevent them from moving under weight.
4,Great build quality,"I bought this for a Epson 8500UB projector. It provided a secure, custom fit and allows for easy adjustments The only thing I don't like is visually, those large screws are very visible once installed. I got used to it, but initially didn't like the look."
5,Very easy to install.,"Just got this to mount my new Mitsubishi DH1000U. I needed something that would let me mount my projector to a sloped ceiling, and this worked perfectly. Only took me about 30 minutes to attach this to the projector, mount it on the ceiling, and adjust it. Really easy to install and adjust.This assembly is heavier duty than it appears in the pictures. All the joints are easy to adjust and are locked in place with pre-installed Allen head lock screws. Once the lock screws are tightened, the mount is completely rigid.They even include the Allen wrench in the box. All you need is a drill with a 5/32 bit for the 3 heavy duty screws that hold it to the ceiling joist, and a Phillips screwdriver (I used a driver bit in a cordless drill).The way this is designed, you could use it to mount a projector to a ceiling or to a wall."
3,For projectors with 3 mounting holes,This is a good mount but it is designed for projectors that only need three mounting points. many projectors need 4 mounting points (one in each corner) this will make this mount difficult to us....
2,Doesn't work with Optoma HD 65,"I ordered this mount for the Optoma HD 65. I bought this one because it was listed as a ""buy together"" with the projector. Unfortunately, it seems that the mount will not work with this projector--- even the smallest size is too large for the projector. I am going to return it and order one specifically for the HD 65, but just a warning for anyone looking at this mount from the ""buy together"" link."
5,Using it my Epson 8350,Great product and it got installed without too much hassle. Also it had the available screws which go with the 8350. Can't be more happeier with it. makes most sense in spending an extra $20 to get the right mount since you don't have to repent it later. Bought my 8350 also at Amazon. Amazon rocks!!
1,very frustrating waste of time and money,"this ""universal"" mount comes with 4 different size screws for different models of projectors...but none of them fit mine. after 3 trips to home depot to find a long enough screw that would fit (didn't happen) i had to scrap this thing and discontinue my projector project until i could get a different (properly ""universal"") mount - which i did.i was so ridiculously frustrated with this thing and so save yourself the frustration and buy something else."
1,don't waste money on this horrible movie!,"first of all, daddy yankee is a horrible actor, poor acting, and a wannabe 50 cent movie. people do me a favor and don't even rent this movie, save your money. (que porqueria de pelicula)."
4,me gusto,"He did a very good job with this movie, being his first one and everything!!good movie! and the last song of the movie, its off the chain!"
2,Daddycouldadonebetter,Me AMO Daddy!! es el reggaetonero mas talentoso del mundo MAS esta pelicula es por la pinga. como se dice B movie en espanol? mi recomendacion es buy the cd & forget this basura. the music kills but the movie bores.
2,You get what you pay for,The quality of these hammers if rather poor. The handles and overall finish and fit is poor. What can you expect for 20 something dollars? The two nylon hammers will probably work well for a little while but the small hammer is really poor. I tried the small hammer and the head starts turning on the handle. I think the small hammer will be pretty much useless.
4,"Great ""little"" book","Dixie's Football Pride delivers facts and a short historical synopsis of some of the Alabama Crimson Tide's most memorable moments in college football, from the National Championship years to its Hall of Famers, this ""coffee table book"" delivers quality information, along with some very colorful and recognizable photos. The best part of the entire book is, of course, on the back bind: a CD, containing two wallpapers, a Tide photo album/screensaver, all versions of the Million Dollar Band's game-time hits (from ""Go Bama"" to ""Rammer Jammer""), and over a handful of sound clips, like the infamous sportscast team Eli Gold and Kenny Stabler, randomly calling the Tide's most memorable plays and incredible teamwork, in what can only be remembered as the pride that IS a part of Alabama football."
5,This is really a glorified booklet. The real draw is the CD!,"There are several great photos in this little book, and highlights featuring the greatest players and teams in Tide history. But the main attraction here is the CD included inside the back cover. It includes two cuts of ""Yea Alabama!"" and standard stadium chants and cheers from the Million Dollar Band. It's also interspersed with radio broadcasts of legendary plays (The Kick, The Sack, and the PSU block among them) that STILL send chills up my spine. When late August rolls around, I play this and get REALLY fired up. A must have purchase for Tide fans, it's a steal."
2,"To Wong Foo, a Remake?","I was immediately struck by the similarity of the storyline to that of the movie ""To Wong Foo..."" New York divas (black, white, hispanic) on a cross-country road trip full of self-discovery. I could change a few words in this book's description and not be too far from the movie's."
2,New RG-6 coax cables won't fit thru bushing,The description just says 'Coax Wall Bushing'. Should indicate that they are too small for the new coax standard: 'RG-6'.
2,"Nice, but kind of lame","I looked at the book for a graduating relative after it was recommended to me. Personally, I thought it was lame. It is long on self-serving emotional tripe and short on any useful advice. Buy it used or don't buy it at all. My bet is that the glowing reviews are the author's friends and relatives since they are all from his home state."
2,It was OK,"I'm graduating this month. Someone gave the book to me. I read the first few sections. It was OK. I guess you just have to live some things to know about them, but honestly I don't know that this book will help me next fall as I adjust to college life. I mean, I've been to campuses and have visited friends in college. I've talked with my friends and all that. They are not wild or anything like that. I'm just saying that the book is like string cheese. You can stretch good things out of it, I guess, but it is still cheese."
4,Super cute!,"There was no product image, but I collect crab toys for my daughter. So I went ahead and ordered it and it was super cute. Had buttons to push, plays raggae type music, it's little claws move. Really fun newborn toy."
5,Yes!,"A complete hands-on guide to creating a successful Healing Arts practice. It steers the reader through practical and easy-to-implement steps to build demand for your service, set your fee, develop a mindset for success, and much more. The guided processes in the accompanying CDs are powerful and effective, and guaranteed to increase your bottom line. I highly recommend this book."
3,Not a Favorite,"My twins LOVE the Little Einsteins and watch their other videos over and over, but they never ask to watch this one. I think the story is too long, repetitive and boring. They actually enjoy the Rocket Soup episode more than the featured one."
4,A new favourite,"My 2yo loves this DVD, she will watch both programs over and over if I let her, she interacts with it and sings the Firebird song even when it's not on. I thought it may be scary for her but she doesn't seem to find it scary at all!"
4,firebird rescue,"Rocket's Firebird Rescue was enjoyed by my 3.5 yr old grandson ,who loves all the Little Einstein adventures,and the next day he was muttering about the ingredients of the soup while he hums some of the music."
1,quite a low level product,"I think that kids are getting quite a wrong idea about such a huge and old culture like Russian one. Nesting doll looks like an evil symbol and soldiers for some reason are very negative characters and many other stuff - let's say - is not presented correct. Honestly, I think kids should not get such a primitive view about such a great country no matter what a political line they have now or used to have.... And I agree with one of the customers who mentioned her kid's fears after watching this ""masterpiece"". I think it is very low although I agree that some of their other products are very fun and educational for kids."
4,Gangsta Music,"This compilation of 19 songs completely glorifies tales and styles of the West Coast. A majority of those are of killa Cali's bouncing grooves. This does have a lot of good material, but there's too many commercial/mainstream songs that were recycled during the early year of 2001 and 2000. A Dogg Pound feature was missed on here as the album is flooded with Snoop Dogg features and solo tracks. Five to be exact. Of those the classics ""Who Am I (What's My Name)"", ""Snoop Dogg (What's My Name Pt. 2)"", and ""Nuthin' But A 'G' Thang"". There's a lot that could have been included that kept this from being a classic release. Included on here is that rowdy ""Down For My N's"" by C-Murder, Snoop Dogg & Magic for a southern gangster flavor. The crip walking ""Who Ride Wit Us"" by Kurupt & Daz to the smooth ""If U Stay Ready"" by Suga Free combined to offer a variety within gangster style. Nuthin But A Gangsta Party 2 has a lot to ride to."
2,Not what i was expecting,"Ok so i bought this item cause i thought it was a double comic package the venom lethal protector #1 with a black background color, and venom lethal protector #5. But instead of getting two comic books i got one solid book that was the entire lethal protector series. The seller needs to be a bit more clear on what they are selling instead of posting two pics of two diffrent comic book covers they should just post the one and make it clear that its a complete series in one big book."
5,"i abused my back,now i'm i pain---heeeeelp!","i abused my spine for many years-slouching,not sitting down the right way,picking things up-the WRONG WAY,etc. i started to suffer from a herniated disk. that is where the ""gel"" in between the vertabrae starts to poke out and it causes ALOT OF PAIN.my sister-who had the same affliction-told me about this book and the exercises in the book.i must say,after reading it carefully and following the exercises,after a few months,i did heal my spine-the gel went back in and now,two years later-i am fine.BUT,i also learned the important lesson of taking care of my back-lifting,bending,etc.this book has PHOTOS of people actually doing the exercises step by step. this is invaluable to the reader/learner. it also shows the correct way to lift objects and sit-all illustrated with excellent photographs.i ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE SUFFERING FROM BACK PAIN. do not give up!--learn from this book-i did."
4,Reasonable entry-level OpenGL Card,"Reasonable entry-level card. Good NT and Win2k drivers (frequently updated). However - benefits more from an Intel processor than from an Athlon (the driver is SSE-enabled). There is a comparative ... about this card on AMD and intel platforms - that shows an anoying decrease in performance on the AMD processors. Otherwise - good card - with suppot on any major 3D applications. Problems in the multi-monitor mode (in an AGP and PCI combination of Oxygen cards - only the primary adapter is OpenGL enabled). To learn major OpenGL apps, it is worthwhile. To do large models with complex structures - you will need soon an upgrade."
4,Personally Pleased,"This little guy is so portable! For the size though you have to make some sacrifice in strength. There have been a few times it's been the victim of a strong gust and blown open inside out. Turning it around quickly had the wind blowing it right back into correct form however and it still works fine opening and closing. It's a small umbrella to be sure. Probably wouldn't work too well for a larger individual or someone with very broad shoulders and certainly not for two people. It's small enough that I can store it in my purse without it being too obtrusive and trust it as an emergency umbrella. I still keep a bigger, sturdier one in my car though. And good luck ever getting it back into it's little sheath.I purchased the Khaki version and the color of the product is true to the picture."
4,Excellent!,"This book provides numerous projects, ranging from small to large. The variety and adaptability of the patterns offer many choices. The patterns are easy to follow, making it nice for a novice or experienced craftsman. Great book -- keeps you going back for more!!"
2,uneven,"I like the depiction of the Korean American as someone who watches from the sidelines, never seen as a ""native speaker."" The only way Henry can really express himself is by having sex with his (white) wife, who is perfect, speaks perfect English, and teaches immigrants how to pronounce English correctly (!). On the other hand, the representations of Korean women (to whom hardly any space is devoted) are disturbing: the mother is dead, the ""auntie"" who replaces her dies without anyone seeming to care much besides Lelia, the politician's wife is beaten by her husband, who also mistreats the bar hostess. This makes me feel like Mr. Lee has some serious problems. Also it makes the book much less enjoyable for me."
2,Not as Good as I Thought it would be!,"This was one of the books that were assigned for my multicultural literature course. I heard so many great reviews on it that I was looking forward to reading it. However, after reading it, I wondered why it recieved so many great reviews. Lee tries to address to many issues all at once. I was hoping that he would develop more the theme of being alienated and tie it in with Henry's biracial marriage. I was looking for some kind of insight from Henry on his cultural identity. The quest in defining Henry's cultural identity was not addressed as well as it could have been. I cannot honestly say that this book was a page turner, at times I had to force myself to keep reading. Very disappointing novel. I wonder if all the great reviews were due to the content of the novel or due to the fact that the author is Korean-American."
3,Perhaps I am over critical...,"Certainly ""Native Speaker"" is a page turner and shows Korean immigrant life realistically, but is this a well written book? I never felt like I got into Henry. He seemed so passive to the problems in his life, and this lack of emotion made Henry unbelievable. Chang-rae brings a Korean-American viewpoint that is well described in this story, but turns it into 'The Firm' at the end. I am uncertain of what the author was trying to do, and do not feel this to be a well written book.As a Korean-American I find myself disturbed by the accolades being heaped on him. I am worried that maybe Mr. Lee is a token, a ""breath of ethnic fresh air"" that I see as terribly patronizing. The question that comes to my mind is did he get press because 'Native Speaker' is a good book, or because the author is Korean?"
5,incisive and elegant,"This is one of the best books I have read to date. I'm not Korean/KA, and I've never been to New York, so I have no idea how well the characters represent either of these facets of America, and don't much care. I read this book and tried to appreciate its narrator and setting as unique rather than metaphorical or archetypal. I found the prose to be exceptionally incisive and elegant in places; in fact sometimes the narrative was so intense for me that it was exhausting. The narrator felt very realistic in that no matter how introspective he became, part of him always seemed to remain a mystery to himself, and Lee does not condescend to the reader or brutalize the prose by spelling it all out. The only other author I've read who can write characters that are both unusually self-analytical and blithely (and realistically) un-self-aware is Haruki Murakami (though the style of the writing is totally different)."
3,"Lyrical, but too autobiographical","A work of fiction should transport the reader beyond the world we perceive around us. When a writer of fiction fails to do this, he is merely recording his initial impressions which may be true but antithetical to fiction. Those initial impressions must be wrought into something almost unrecognizable, otherworldly if you like, and made to serve the structure of the novel. I must confess that there were aspects of Chang Rae-Lee's novel that I found deeply moving because of their familiarity (I'm Korean American), but speaking as a student of the novel form, I found the book to be a lyrical autobiography with a smattering of artifice (the stuff of fiction) to give it a flavor but not the taste of genuine fiction."
2,A poor choice,"It is unfortunate that ""Native Speaker"" is the likely choice for New York City's ad hoc citywide reading group, as The New York Times reported Feb. 19. I typically read 25+ novels a year, and last year this novel was the least interesting and most cliched I picked up. I forced myself to finish it.""Native Speaker"" is so very similar to Tom Wolfe's ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" in tone, attitude and description that it offers very little that is original and revealing. Wolfe's novel was deserving of its praise, but it does not follow that a book that apes Wolfe should also be lauded. Occasionally Lee's prose may indeed be ""remarkable"" as some reviewers have suggested, but more often his writing is flat, predictable and downright boring.I am not a Korean American, but I live very near Manhattan's Koreatown, spend much time there, and I speak some Korean. I was eager to read this book given my interests, yet no book recently disappointed me as much as ""Native Speaker"" did."
5,Masterful,"As a writer, I was awed by the skill with which this author told his story. One of the most masterfully written stories I've ever read. Dana Bagshaw"
4,"Never mind the ""Korean-American Experience""...","It seems rather insulting to the author that so many reviewers insist upon discussing it as some sort of Korean-American cultural artifact, rather than considering it simply as a novel. Personally, I have nothing to say regarding whether it's an accurate portrayal of the ""Korean-American Experience"" (whatever that may mean to any given person), but I did enjoy Native Speaker as an entertaining and thought-provoking novel. Lee's writing is evocative and honest, and unlike many non-genre writers today, he actually tells a story with all those well-chosen words. The protagonist recounts the history of his relationship with his wife as events unfold in his career, but the two storylines seem to intertwine naturally, rather than jumping back and forth in a distracting way. In the end, it becomes clear that the separation between his professional life and his marriage is the cause of his problems in both."
3,"Jack of all trades, master of none. This is Henry Park.","I really enjoyed the first half of this book. It seemed like the author was building questions about the main character, Henry Park in the mind of the reader. How disappointed to find that not to be the case entirely. I wanted to know, for example, why their son was named Mitt. The perspective regarding American and Korean views of interracial marriage was interesting. Park seemed almost too willing to try to be all things to all people. I enjoyed the way his childhood memories are sprinkled among present day activities. The dichotomy of his two worlds threaten to ruin his life"
2,a mediocre hybrid of a novel,"The writing was okay, but Lee seemed to have wanted to write a spy novel grafted onto an ethnic identity novel, and ends up having neither. There are plenty of other (better) Asian American and Korean American writers out there... Maybe Lee's second novel will be less an attempt at commercialism while tapping into a ""hot"" market, multiculturalism..."
5,My daughter loved it - and so did I!,Wonderful book! Real life. Real issues. And reality TV! Wendy Lawton provides a delightful read for girls -- and the moms who love them. Highly recommended!
1,"LaPorte, Indiana by Jason Bitner","I believed this would be a picture history of LaPorte. It turned out, however, to be a bunch of classbook pictures without identification. The book is meaningless."
5,Best Parrish Book Ever! Wont last-A sellout,"With over 400 four color illustrations, a text which analyzes, explains and documents in over 480 pages, this is without question the nearest thing to a Catalogue Raisonee on Maxfield Parrish. Part of a series which includes Leonardo and Michelangelo, vanGogh, and the only American artist is MP!!! Wow, what a testimony!!!!!"
5,Maxfield Parrish,I love the art work of Maxfield Parrish. I even found a section about a picture I own in the book. Great Book.
2,BAD REPRODUCTIONS,"It's sad that such an otherwise valuable book suffers from shockingly poor reproductions. More than half of the illustrations are either grossly too light or too dark, with crude contrast balances. The colors are also frequently wrong. In short, the printing of this book was a rushed, cheap, hack-job done in China. Basically, the book is nearly worthless. I'm very disappointed, this could have been a very wonderful art book."
1,"Unfortunately, not well done!",I personally found the book to be a big disappointment...both in quality of content as well as knowledge of subject matter.There are too many similarities to other published works to suit me.
1,Bottom of the barrel,"To be fair, I have heard only the ""Knoxville"" from this recording. A ""classical music"" radio station played it today. I've not heard the rest of the recording.Because of what I heard, I came looking for the recording and reviews. I found only one, by D. A. Wend, who described the performance by Ruth Golden as the worst. That doesn't go nearly far enough. The voice is ugly, the intonation is abysmal, the performance is a mess in every way. I've heard much better student performances of this really wonderful piece. You wonder who at Decca made the decision to actually commit this performance to a CD."
3,99 gets a 65,"99 starts in the year 99 and shows Cyrus Broacha as Zaramud and Kunal Khemu as Sachin on the run from the police because they have been busted in a SIM card cloning case. On the run they steal a Mercedes which belongs to AGM played by Mahesh Manjrekar and thus they end up being hunted and wind up eventually working for him as money collectors. They come to Delhi on a collection assignment and get embroiled in match fixing. The movie derives a lot of its inspiration from the old crime capers where confusions and mistaken identities run galore but falls short. If you watched just the first 30 minutes you would think that this 99 is definitely getting a 100 but.....I would settle for about 65. Mahesh Manjrekar is good, so is Vinod Khanna. Boman Irani is the best of the cast. All I can say that it this movie is interesting in parts. 3 stars. 3/7/10"
2,"Great screen, big dent","Unfortunately it came bent like other reviewers had mentioned though. I was too lazy to return, so now I have it hanging from the ceiling. The screen and the frame look great minus the huge dent."
3,Gets The Job Done,"There's not a whole lot you can say about anchor pins - they're pretty simple - made from metal and they stake into the ground. So I'll keep this simple. They are of good length, work as advertised, but are not as strong as I had hoped. They tend to bend if the ground is not soft enough. They can be re-used later if they're not bent too much. I wouldn't recommend these in dry climates where the ground is harder."
1,gooses review,This book tells you all about communication which is interesting but it dosent help you give a speech at all. There really isnt any way to train someone to give a speech just by reading a book so if your intent is to give speeches just watch some cnn or fox news channel. maybe a couple of clinton and bushes speeches so you can see what to do and what not to do. the best way to use this book is to help you judge your speech on how many of the goals of oration you have accomplished.
1,Don't waist your money,"I was drawn to this pathetic excuse for 'intertainment' by the stellar cast--who then proceded to sleepwalk like zombies on valium through out the entirety of this peice of lame garbage. Offencively bad wrighting, acting, and directing. The musical score sounds like it was lifted from Star Treck, the oridginal series. Dito for the costumeing and 98% of the special effects. Apart from about two minutes of decent special efects with the harpies,( I wish they HAD HAVE got Jason!! ), this movie is bad, bad, bad!!"
4,All his classics including Up On The Housetop,"I reviewed another Autry Christmas CD. I was disappointed with that one because ""Up On THe Housetop"" was missing. This CD has that and most of his other signature Christmas tunes. Gene didn't have much of a vocal range, but he sang from the heart, and that's what mostly counts. His version of ""Housetop"" has all the verses. Also on here are Rudolph, Frosty, Here Comes Santa Claus (which he wrote), If It Doesn't Snow on Christmas, The Night Before Christmas (with Rosemary Clooney), Santa Claus is Coming To Town, and more. 18 selections. Good for a family gathering or while wrapping or exchanging gifts with loved ones."
3,Color a little off....,"I actually ended up returning this item after it showed up; not for quality issues, but mainly for color. The fabric was heavy duty and well put-together. However, the ""taupe"" color seemed off. It had more of a greenish hue to it, which obviously didn't match anything I currently own. I'm not sure about the color matching of the other colors, but buyer beware if you're trying to match these shams to an existing ensemble."
5,Excellent Quality Matelasse Euro Sham,"I purchased two of the ""Brick"" red euro shams, which are a beautiful ""true"" red color.The quality is exceptional; thick, soft, great matelasse texture.These will be sure to last a long, long time even with regular use.I'm very pleased with this purchase and they were a steal on sale!!(I also ordered the matching matelasse coverlet.)"
4,Light weight-has excellent sound-a bargin,"I was looking for 2 players for my two son's rooms. I began the search looking for a CD/MP3 player. Disappointed in my Memorex, I looked at Sony and several others. But I found that they all lacked for something. I then went back to the tradional CD boomboxes and researched and bought two of these models. This unit has excellent sound for such a small player. It is very light and will be in rooms with small boys, so that is a plus. I was most impressed with the price. I got mine for ~$.... The sound is excellent. It has a preset EQ with Pop, Rock, Jazz, and no boost settings. The Jazz setting is the best IMHO and gives the music a little kick. The unit has a remote, a back light, timer, and will repeat all or a single track on a CD. Quite a plus for the little ones who like to hear things over and over again. So far, no problems."
3,Damaged goods,"When I opened the package the first speaker that I removed was in excellent condition. I used this speaker to create my box layout. Once I was done with the box and began installation of the speakers I noticed that the metal housing was bent in the area where the mounting screw was located. I did not have the time to send the equipment back so I adjusted the metal to the best of my ability and completed the installation. Which made up my mind that in the future I WILL NOT order equipment on line when I have a dead line. Just something to keep in mind, it's not like you can drive down the road and get a replacement at the local box store.Any way the speakers sound find and the customer was happy."
5,Worth every dollar,"Always been a big fan of Polk audio. Very good speakers, produce great hi-low's but I highly recommend to amp them."
4,No fish tale,"Item was as advertised. It arrived quickly. It is not top of the line cookware, but is of decent quality. For the number of times it will be used, it is perfectly fine.It is also magnetic stainless steel, so can be used on my induction cook top as well as in the oven."
1,George and Martha Back in Town,"I knew the book would be used, but not with the amount of damage. The cover is damaged and it detracts from the whole book."
5,Destilando Amor,"If anyone want to see a wonderful love story I will recommend this one. Thanks to this company for the fast shipping of this video , I love it. Thanks, Maria"
3,Remake of Cafe Con aroma de mujer,"This telenovela was an exact reporoduction of ""cafe con aroma de mujer"" with Guy Ecker and Margarita Rosa(with all the events and scenes) except that the actors were different.my advice that if you hadn't watched the original telenovela then it is ok to watch this version on DVD, otherwise stick to your memories because the first production (actors and acting) is much better and more convincing than this one.i give this telenovela 3 stars because of my favorite actor Eduardo Yanez"
2,destilando amor,"I wanted to buy this soap opera because is a classic of all times, with a great love and tequila story, I wanted to have it in my library. Everything was fine until I tried to watch the 4th video, not good at all, frozen images, bad audio and broken dialog. I think they should have a better quality control and test the product before is put up for sale. If anyone know of a Destilando amor, perfect and in top shape video, please let me know. still would like to own one.Amazon was very professional taking care of the return and issuing an immediate refund."
1,awful adaptation,"I saw many years ago ""Cafe con aroma de mujer"" and when I knew about adaptation cast by Angelica Rivera I though it might be good remake... big mistake then. Angelica overacts terribly and story line is very unreal, cut from the original version. It's a shame!!!Long life for first version ""CAFE CON AROMA DE MUJER"" with Margarita Rosa de Francisco & Guy Ecker"
5,Destilando Amor,"I've never watched telenovelas but accidently picked this up thinking it was a movie. I decided to watch it and I really loved it. it was so romantic, exciting, and humorous at the same time. I recommend this to those who love romance and excitment."
1,No Spanish Subtitles,"Despite what the product details say, this DVD does NOT have Spanish subtitles. This is a great disappointment because we selected this telenovela instead of some others because of the purported Spanish subtitles."
3,Telenovelas on DVD are too choppy,"The DVD is very choppy. If I hadn't seen the Telenovela, I wouldn't know what was happening."
3,What Happened,"What happened to this Novela, it was one of the great Novela to come out on Univision, I wantched everyone night, and now that I purched it I'm so disappointed, so much has been cut out. Some of the best parts are not in the movie, the love seens that made this Novela are gone. SOOOO dissappointed!!!!"
1,Best Novela Ever but DVD version is heavily edited and cut.,"One of the best tele novela ever. But this DVD version gives you 80% less time(less hours) than the one broadcast on t.v.A lots of scene are heavily edited and does not exist in this DVD version. I dont undrestant why they did it. They try to fit this novela in 4 DVD instead of 12 or een 16 DVD.This dvd comes with english sub title.If you've already seen this novela on t.v., you will not enjoy it as much because they cut so many scenes that you would have look forwarded to see it again and now is meaning less.I don't recommend this DVD.Dont waste your money for this trashy DVD version."
5,Great Story,"Destilando AmorWhat a great story! Rodrigo has to be the biggest fool that ever lived! Poor Gaviota for putting up with 4 years of angst over him! But it all works out in the end. Glad I watched the condensed DVD version! Not sure I could have handled the full year of episodes. The editing was done so well that you did not seem to lose any of the storyline. The scenes at the end when Gaviota and Rodrigo were on vacation together at the water falls was filmed partly at Cascadas de Micos, which is twenty minutes from my wife's home town of Ciudad Valles. Nice to see this site in a Telenovela. And yes, This DVD DOES HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES! So if you do not speak Spanish, then you can still enjoy this great story!"
5,Amazing !!!,"This is a great documentary film about music and musicians in Istanbul. All different kinds of music. Not just traditional but pop, rock, jazz, hip-hop, classical, vocals, instrumental..... and many different kinds of instruments too. Istanbul is an interesting place. It has western and eastern influence. This film is quite different from the image that you see on the cover. So, forget about the picture of the cover and just try watching. It is COOL.Seattle"
3,Good music in bad documentary,"Watch it for the music, which is stunning and diverse, but try to tune out Alexander Haacke's painfully self-conscious posturing through this film, which positions him less as a narrator than a heroic soul-searching artist. Needless to say, most viewers who are looking to understand the complex and contentious tapestry of contemporary Turkish music could do without the endless scenes of Haacke pensively smoking cigarettes in his hotel room, striding down lonely avenues, and gazing across the Bosphorous at sunset. His narration adds little, and is rendered superfluous by well-edited interview footage and excellent live performances. There is a beautiful and moving film buried in this vanity-fest, and well worth picking the diamonds out of the dung."
3,Good Music but....,"I left the movie feeling like I saw way too much of German bass-player Alexander Hacke. He lurks in every scene, smoking cigarettes, playing with his hair, and just generally being self-involved, swaggering around trying his best to be a cool bassist. And as another reviewer says, he contributes nothing. A few times it even looked like he was creeping out some of the musicians.So if you are interested purely in the music, its worthwhile. But if you are looking for a film, try one of the director's others: The Edge of Heaven and Head On are both great."
2,"Somewhat interesting, but not worthy of more then 2 stars","This movie is interesting, but a long shot from the 4 and 5 star reviews that made me give it a view. I have traveled to Turkey and loved the country. I was drawn to this movie and it's reviews for this reason. The musicians are mediocre and the film quality is average. I'd say - don't buy this film, check for it on Netflix instead."
1,after 2 weeks' use,"great disappointment. the buttons do not do what they say. v ery poor speech quality/clarity. aage 82, i sought fewer answering problems, instead more."
2,"15% wisdom, 60% overdone analogies, and 25% advertising.","Hyrum Smith did have a couple of gems, such as ""Learn to say NO!"", in this CD audio book, but not enough to require two CDs. The gladiator analogy, although interesting from a historical perspective, is repeated too many times to be useful. He did demonstrate that he understood the effects of information overload, but really didn't offer much to counter it, other than a long sales pitch to buy the Franklin-Covey products."
2,"Good idea, but...",I liked the idea of the gladiator/free lancer profesionally trained soldier as modern worker and have read/listened to a couple of books using the same subject (Live Rich by Stephen Pollan was the best). Hyrum Smith has taken the topic and just ruins any thought of businessman/woman as warrior. It is bland as plain generic vanilla and not as motivational or informative as expected. The first CD was a re-hash of the Franklin/Covey books written before with some statistics about information overload thrown in and the second has about 15 minutes of usable information. I have read Hyrum's work before and honestly I expected better.Here's the short version: 1. Life used to be much more simple. 2. Soldiers used to use long swords and shields until the romans introduced the short sword and shield. 3. Use whatever tools make you effective in business and check out my website to buy them. the end.
2,Don't get this CD,I got this CD to later find out that it's not songs- it's just her talking. I would much rather have her singing. It's good if you want to be a singer bcause it's inspiring. If you want songs I recomend the CD Christina Aqualieria.
5,Michael Long Prevails,"I've known Michael Long since 1985 and since his release of this recording back in the early 90's, he has established himself as a first-rate guitarist. This recording is a sumptuously delicious escape into the post-impressionist orchestral writings of Hovhaness. While the performance at times seems excessively subdued - almost to the point as if the musicians have stopped playing - you are nonetheless transported to an ethereal musical chasms charmed by Long's phrasing and dedication to rhythmical nuances. This is a first-rate recording! Let's hear more!"
4,Great Alarm Clock but...,This alarm clock is really great. Easy to use steps and a seperate alarm time for each day. The only downside is that the radio is HORRIBLE but I guess they made it a dial radio to avoid buttons and more user friendly. I found the other features to be not very useful because I dont use nap or the radio. The alarm clock funtion is all I need it for and its all I will ever use on this product.
4,Clock with great feature,Wonderful alarm clock for anyone who gets up at different times on different days. Just set it once and forget it. So far it has never failed to go off. I wish the display was easier to read and the off button was bigger. I sometimes hit the snooze by mistake.Update 7/2007. Still like the clock but when the power is out the battery keeps the time/settings but the alarm doesn't go off.
4,"Does the job, but with one potential flaw.","If you're a college student looking for an alarm clock, then you've found your match. As a student with a busy schedule that varies day-to-day, this clock has been a godsend. It functions perfectly as described, but with one somewhat annoying flaw: the display. While most alarm clocks have fairly large letters, this one is really lacking in the readability department. If you don't have it right next to your pillow, you'll have a hard time reading it, especially right when you wake up. That being said, the variable daily alarms are incredible, and worth every penny."
1,HATED IT!,"The radio also makes an annoying 'pop' when you turn it on or the alarm kicks in. To set the time and alarm settings take forever. Just a horrible purchase that I made, don't make the same mistake!"
4,Superior,"The ratchet knob on the top sets the time a minute per click, so it really takes a lot of work to set a time 12 hours, but it does the job. The radio isn't really that great but I can get local stations ok. I took the clock apart and wired it to activate a fire buzzer when the alarm goes off. The only parts I needed was a reed relay, some wire and a switch. Now I can really wake up with a serious alarm. (any day of the week)The liquid quartz display is too hard to read. I can't see to make out the days of the week. I like the clock and it is a good idea, but I wish all letters and numbers were LEDs so I could see them."
4,Nice!,"Build quality is OK. This is a decent alarm clock for the money. I like not having to worry about my alarm going off every morning. If your schedule is the same every week, this clock is great. You never have to touch the alarm clock. I have been very happy with this alarm clock. The sound quality is pretty good.Fairly easy to setOnce set, waking up is easySound is OKGood clock for the price."
2,"The idea is appealing, the reality sleeps on.","The idea of this alarm clock is very appealing: an alarm clock that can be easily individualized for the day of the week. Here, however, is the reality in two bullet points:1. The tuner is awful. Within ten minutes of having located a staion the focus has slipped and you have to relocate it or listen to gradually worstening static.2. The alarm clock component is about 95% accurate. Think on that . . .5% of the time you will not be awakened. My partner and I have had it for a year and for the longest time thought that one of us had done something wrong in setting it. Or we were sure that we had done it right but waking up late hadn't made us tardy for anything. This morning was the last straw,though. 5%, when you are depending on this little monster is not good enough.And now, off to shop Amazon for a new clock radio."
2,difficult,"The description of this product seemed ideal.. Not to have to reset your alarm for differnt schedules everyday. However the directions are very brief and vague and the clock is hard to set, both the time and alarm. Didn't want to bother sending it back so I put it in the guest rooom where a clock is needed, but not an alarm."
1,came defective,"The idea of how the product should work is good. However the product came defective, there was no sound available from the speaker. Neither, the alarm or the radio would produce any sound. The product was no longer available from Amazon. Still waiting for refund."
2,Cheap,"Didnot keep this clock, wasn't what I wanted... cheap clock with too many knobs for my taste..."
5,It's very good even if your not a rock fan!,"I'm not a fan of rock but this song is very good! It doesn't have strong electro-pop constantly as it starts off quite quiet and it builds up to a steady sound. The music isn't constantly pounding away rock that hurts your head which is great!The reason why I seem to like it is because they use that music for a TV Programme on Living TV! It's got me hooked this song! Take it from me, it's great, so buy it! #I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE!!!#"
2,"Its not rock, its dance/house","Just cos it has guitars doesnt mean its rock, its a club anthem championed by techno DJ Pete Tong which was a HUGE hit in Europe and UK even if it didnt deserve to."
3,good product no parts,i had lots of fun with this toy until the propeller broke.I thought i could just order one from air hogs or find one on ebay.I checked all over the internet and called air hogs but could not find a thing.I am still looking for a replacement.I you do buy this product get it from a retailer so you can get a 90 day warranty if you break a prop.Don't fly this on grass because thats what breaks props.This is a great beginner rc plane.
2,Air Hoggs Mini -,"After a couple of flights, the perpeller came off and was lost. Not as durable as expected. We are having a hard time trying to order a replacement part. I don't think that we got $40.00 worth of play out of it with only getting to fly it one day."
4,"Fun book and easy to read, follow and show the story","I like this book because when it says that Violet is looking at rain, you can see and show the rain. The pictures are clean and easy to understand and go perfectly with the text I'm reading on the page. The pictures are cute and the story is just long enough for our bed time story."
4,Not just for camcorders.......digicams to,"I have a digital camera that has a large zoom lens. This bag accomodates it and other accessories, memory and gadgets quite well. The outboard zippered pockets allow for other personal effects to be stowed away and safe. Perfect for travel or a photo shoot. Not to big or small. The leather like surface can receive rough handling without falling apart. At approx [price] it is was very good deal."
4,Great bag for my Nikon D40,"This bag is just what I needed. It has room for my charging and USB cables, my cleaning kit, camera with neck strap, and an extra lens. You could fit two lenses in the bag if they are relatively small.The bag is insulated well enough for me to feel confident and not worry about it while traveling."
5,A must reading for all those involved in develop.ped.therap.,"An excellent text presenting two of the most popular therapeutic paradigms in the contemporary developmental pediatric therapies, the NDT and the SI approach. Based on a sound scientific background the authors present an eclectic and holistic approach (a combination of the above paradigms) to the treatment of cerebral palsy, autism & fragile X, down syndrome etc. Along with Lois Bly's and Jean Ayre's books a MUST READING for all those involved in developmental pediatric therapies."
1,Description is Wrong - ZERO STARS,"When I recieved this I thought there had been a mistake, but when I exchanged it for the correct book with a message describing what happened Amazon sent back the same one. Don't be fooled - there are only 10 songs in this, but they charge you for the 19 song book.I'll continue sending it back to Amazon until someone notices it is wrong or they stop paying for the shipping and handling charges."
5,They are tennis balls. Easy,"Tennis balls. They are no different from any you will find in any sports aisle or store out there. When they are worn out, the dogs love them. The company who ships them does a great job shipping quickly."
5,Bought for kids and friends.,"I bought this because my kids were doing a science project and needed it. We bought a lot though so I gave it away to friends and mailed some to Afghanistan to my husband. No complaints so far. In fact, I was quite impressed at how well it mails. It was sent in a package of other foods to Afghanistan. We got the box back a month later. It looked like it had been run over by truck, a train and a semi, was shot with a BB gun, dumped from the top of a building and then taped back together. I'm not even kidding. We had to rebox everything. The cans held up fine and so did the coffee-mate creamer packages. But anything else that was plastic or wrapped in a packaging box had fallen apart or was ripped... or a few things that were shot with shrapnel.I highly suggest this for flavor AND for sending to our troops. Nothing else in the box will make it (except the cans) but they'll have delicious coffee because it will make it JUST FINE!"
2,A rushed spy novel that tries hard...,"Ted Allbeury's first novel ""A Choice of Enemies"" feels very rushed, and fails to make us care about the hero, who finds out that his long-lost daughter lives in the Soviet Union, and then falls in love with a Polish spy while in Communist Warsaw, where he is reunited with his daughter. The book goes from the aftermath of WWII, up to the early '70s, where Foltran and COBOL where only known to a select few, and considered high-tech. Anyway, the hero breaks up a complex ring using computers to steal secrets, and in the climax, tries to escape Poland with his lady love. The novel does a decent job at portraying the Poles and Russians as human."
5,Lots of MUD for the BUCKS!,"This CD contains 2 complete record albums: ""Big Bill Broonzy"" and the classic ""Folk Singer."" Mobile Fidelity made an ""Ultradisc"" of Folk Singer, which I heard being used at a hi-end stereo store to ""demo"" a $20K system. This recording sounds almost as good. The late, great Joe Williams covered ""Just a Dream (On My Mind)."" A well-known guitar player from Texas may have been influenced by one of the songs presented here... he named his band ""Double Trouble."" If you are a long-time Muddy fan, and are missing either of these recordings, buy this CD. If you are new to Muddy, and want to get your feet wet (muddy), you can't go wrong with this CD."
2,These are not as Sold,"I'm no expert, but I do have at least a high school education. They sell these speakers as ""four way"" clearly stated on the box (after I received them) three way speakers, I think they owe me compensation for misrepresentation/false advertisement. They so far they still seem like outstanding speakers, however I've yet to install them into my 2006 Mustang Gt. However, they sold me a product under false pretenses."
4,OK Speakers,I purchased these simply for the price. My daughter just recently bought a used 2004 Ford Explorer and I have a 2003 Ford Pick up. This size fit both vehicles. I was in the market for two new head units as both of ours did not work or have what we needed. I added these to my budget because she had no rear speakers and mine sounded bad. After putting in the head units mine were great and I got my daughters working (bad connection). I decided to trade them out for the rear to get a better connection.They sound better than the factory speakers. If you have a Ford and are on a budget you can not go wrong with these. Do they sound GREAT? Who are you kidding? Look at the price! But for the price a really good purchase for an aging system on a budget. I would purchase again.
1,Junk,"I bought these speakers after reading some of the reviews. I thought maybe I would get a decent sound at a discounted price. I replaced a factory head unit with a JVC 50x4. And replaced factory speakers with these. They blew on me at volume levels less than half of what the JVC can put out. Remember the JVC has 50 watts RMS and these speakers are marketed with 140 watts RMS. Give me a break! I would in reality say they have 20 watts RMS. These speakers are not four way they are three way, another false representation in marketing. Now I have to install speakers all over again. You can bet I'll go with a good set of Pioneer or Kenwood this time."
5,"Laugh Out Loud, Funny!","This is my favorite of the ""Best of"" collection! I laughed until I cried at points!"
5,"Chris Kattan, Best of",Chris Kattan is just hilarious and so versitile in his roles. He just cracked me up so bad I was crying. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who wants to laugh.
3,"Code of Federal Regulations, Title 25: Indians (Revised as of April 1, 2004)","How do you review a book containing regulations? The detail in this CFR is intense, as you would expect from any government set of rules and regulations.This issue is outdated now. The updated versions are now on the internet. However, in dealng with any legal issue of the Federal Government with the American Indians, this book should be on your desk."
4,In this book's opition.....,"Guide is good and covers everything I've come across. One frustrating thing about cacti is that different books have different names (common and scientific) for the same cactus. I don't know which - if any - would be considered the ""correct"" one, but this book seems to include many of the slang names by which a lot of cacti are known. Bought this book primarily to help ID some of the cacti we run across in west Texas."
2,Wide but Shallow,"Briefly introduces you to the elements of JBuilder database development. The coverage is wide but extremely shallow. You will obtain a cursory understanding of many database development topics. Each presentation covers less than is covered in JBuilder3's Developer's Guide, which comes with JBuilder3, and is surprisingly accessible. Like the other volumes in the Referentia series, you can use this to rapidly acquire a comfortable ""feel"" for the topics, but you won't gain a sound understanding of database development from the superficial exercises."
1,Forget it if you Like Mac,"Again another company that has ignored the Mac crowd. I bought one but it does not work with Mac OS X. Incredibly even though Mac OS X has been out over a year, they include a program for Os 9.0. But for those of us who have switched we are out of luck."
1,Not so great,My treo was not at all durable. After one year the flip part did not work so the phone only worked with a headset. After a while the headset would not pick up calls. It also locked up and had to be rebooted in the middle of calls on a regular basis. There was a rebate with the phone and handspring never sent the rebate even with the appropriate documentation.
4,Totally Unbelieavable- I Like Mine.,"I was finally going to shelf my PalmIIIxe and upgrade to a newer model Palm. I researched what devices would best fit my needs for what I do and also be able to support programs I would need on my new device. I was also excited to see a PDA with a keyboard on it. My Treo is sleek, small and for my super liking, it is lightweight. I have never been so excited about a PDA before but I just can't get over how great my TREO 90 is. I enjoy a color screen, great battery life and a keyboard. I have had it over a month now and I haven't had any issues or challenges. I am also enjoying the DateBook+ feature. I feel I have benefited positively from my Treo 90. Thanks."
1,Quite functional but has needed replacement twice in 6 month,"The unit is highly functional and I love it's keyboard although it is slightly small for my fingers. However, despite it's nice design I am giving it 1 star because it failed about 2 months after I got it and then the new, replacement, unit failed after 3 months (would no longer turn on without performing a full reset of the unit). Even though the unit was under warranty PalmOne (Handspring) charged me $25 each time to replace the unit and also charged me $20 for telephone service to determine that the unit was defective. Thus, I am now on my 3rd Treo 90 in the last 6 months, have paid an additional $70 in fees, and have spent countless hours trying to restore my data from back-up (not to mention two 20 minute telephone waits despite a recording that the ""estimated wait time is 1 minute""). I bought this because of the great design but now I see why PalmOne (Handspring) is losing market share - poor construction and lousy customer service."
2,"Handspring, not very customer friendly","After eight months of having my Treo 90, it totally went blank on me, with no apparent reason. I used it lightly and it was pretty much, still new. I contacted Handspring for assistance because my PDA was still under warranty. However, they told me that they could not help me because I was located at a military installation. After much running around and persistence, I returned it back to where I bought it and got a refund. If a product goes out before a year,it is still under warranty, and a company does not make any effort to help in the matter, it's not worth buying their product.I guess it is their loss. I was really contemplating on getting the newest Handspring, Treo 300. Now, I am shopping elsewhere. Buyers, beware!"
2,Treo 90 Needs work,I've used the Treo 90 for several months and it needs some work:1. The power is always on - hit a button and it turns on.2. The battery is always dead - a result of issue #13. The pen falls freely out of its holder - I have bought 4 pens to date.4. The case is poorly fitting.5. Even in the leather case it still turns on. What is really frustrating is by snapping the case closed - it turns the power on.6. The memu (HOME) feature requires two key strokes - make it one key stroke for HOME and two key strokes to turn on the power.Fix the above and the unit is great! Increase the screen resolution and it is perfect.RR
4,"Finally, a PDA everyone can use!","Well, after 2 tries with other Palm based PDA's I finally have one I can actually use. For some reason I could not re-learn the writing requirement on other PDA's and got frustrated with the whole process. I was looking for something simple, that would sync easily and that I could add/remove info as needed. I look seriously at the Windows based PDA, but the same thing, re-learn how to write - but for more money. Then I saw the Treo. Tried the phone version at about every store who carried them so I could get a feel for the keyboard function. Then decided to try one more time.Well, so far so good. Easy to sync, easy to enter data and easy to work on. So, I would recommend it, especially for the ""writing challenged:."
1,Very poor quality hardware,"I've owned a Treo 90 for just over six months now, and I've had to return it four times. Once for a broken keyboard, and the last three times because the backlight failed on the color screen.I'm disappointed because I liked the small size, the handy little keyboard, and the flip-cover that protects the keyboard and screen. Unfortunately all that nice design is fouled up by the really lousy hardware quality.My previous handheld, an old Palm III, lasted years and years. In fact when I upgraded to the Treo the old Palm was still working and I foolishly gave it away to a friend. Shouldn't have done that--now I'm gonna have to buy a replacement for the Treo 90."
2,Two Strikes And You're Out,"The Treo 90 has some great features: great screen color and resolution - compact size - built in keyboard. My wife loved it until the backlight went out after about a month of light usage. After a fair amount of hassle she was able to get a replacement unit from the store she purchased the original from. Shortly after getting the second new unit, it began to turn on by itself - just sitting on the table! No wonder she was frustrated at constantly needing to recharge it. It's hard to tell how often it turned itself on and off when in her purse. Also when it was in use, she had it ""toggle"" between programs for no apparent reason. Today we ended her struggles and returned it once again - This time for a new Palm - M515. Sorry Handspring; you've got a good idea, but it sure needs some work!"
3,Died after one year,"I loved my Treo 90....while it lasted. One month after the warranty was up the unit completely died. Reset wouldn't help it. The manufacturer would repair it...for almost the cost of a new one. Be wary of this product.Not sure why Amazon has decided to place this review of the Treo 90 in the comments section of the hinged storage box, but...I have never used the hinged storage box so cannot offer any advice!"
5,I'd give it 6 stars if I could,"I have looked at handhelds for the last three months to replace my Visor. After looking and using all of the Pocket PC/WinCE devices, all of the Sony's, the Sharp (the linux one, I forget the name) and the Hand Era: the Treo 90 is what I chose to go with. For the price, the size, the color features, the other options (carrying case excluded) and Handspring's customer support (I dealt with them without problems on 4 seperate occasions over the past 2 years, each experience was excellent) the Treo 90 beat all the others hands down (the Sony's were like a small brick). The only complaint I have is the carrying case opitions for the Treo 90 are seriously lacking. I am looking for a billfold type case similar to what Handspring offered for the Visor. The flip case I bought can barely hold paper money let alone anything else. Its mainly designed for business cards. Other than the case issue, for a straight-forward PDA (without the phone) the Treo 90 is the way to go."
2,poor Mac support,I was very dissappointed when I went to install the desktop software on my iBook running OS X and the system crashed requiring a complete reinstillation of OS X. Only after going to the Handspring website and searching did I find any reference to the Treo 90 being incompatible with a Mac running OS X. Handspring really blew it.
3,Not the perfection that I anticipated....,"Any company that charges me $19.95 to speak to a customer support person on the phone is a company that I will not do business with again!! I'm muddling through with the online help for the TREO 90, which is cumbersome. It's a neat little machine but the lack of live support was quite a surprise. Also, the flip cover is pretty flimsy. Other than that, the features seem to work as promised."
2,Worst repair service,"I broke the flip lid of the Treo 90 -- and called to get a new one. Palm-One and Handspring are not only back-ordered on this item, they will not even take new orders for flip lids.The flip lid is the first thing to break. And without one, one cannot protect the Treo in one's front pocket (or other small spaces). Leather cases are too large.Time to get a Sony!"
2,no OS X,My first PDA. I really like the keyboard. The size is nice too. It does support older MAC OS 9. But I'm into OS X now and it seems the little treo is not. So it's going back tomorrow morning.
1,Defective products - backlights,"Nice product - until the backlight on the screen died.Handspring has been manufacturing Treos with defective backlights. Please be aware that if this problem occurs, they will only send you a REFURBISHED Handspring to replace your defective one - which they don't mention on their website (http://support.handspring.com/esupport/forms/hsResolutionView.jsp?ResolutionId=8433#6).Either that, or they push it back on Amazon to send you a new one - with possibly the same defect.I don't want a used Handspring - I paid for a new one.Handspring needs to distribute products that work - simple enough, right?"
3,Too small of a keyboard,"I was looking at the treo and thought that it would be a great buy. well after playing with it for a while I thought that the keyboard was way too small and that it did not come with enough colors. only 4,000. I also thought that it was kinda stupid to have that clear cover. though it could be nice in the treo with the phone and all but not on this one. I did like how ever that it was very small and light. Just it was too small of a keyboard. I still like the grafiti and thought it was just as fast. If you are coming from a blackberry you will like this. It has a light thin and sompact and if you are used to the keyboard you will love this. I ended up with a Sony Clie T615C. It has alot more programs more colors (64,000+) and a newer opperating system of Palm OS (4.10). I also like how you can view pics , do slide shows, have a version of like a mapquest. I thought that The sony was a better buy untill a new operating system comes out for the treo and more colors."
2,One Star Above Terrible,"I didn't give this a one because I think anyone who does a work for the Lord deserves something better than the worst. But, I feel this was about the worst CD I've hear in a while. Lamar Campbell's voice is so irritating. There will only be one Fred Hammond. There are so many people that can sing. Let them. Please!!!"
4,Confessions of a Worshipper,"This is the first Lamar Campbell CD I have ever bought. I have always loved his music not knowing that this was the great artist behind it.I appreciate the music and it has definitely ministered to me. In my perspective that is what should be important. I have purchased tapes and CD's in the past where not every song was the best, but if I can find something out of them that ministers to a situation in my life, then it makes my purchase worthwhile.I will not stand in judgment of another's review, but the reader should not take our total opinion, but listen on line or go to a store where this is possible.I enjoy the vocal sound of Denise Clark. I play there is nothing too hard for God numerous times a day. I look forward to hearing more of her on future Campbell projects.I plan to purchase the past CD's in support of this artist's ministry. I pray you are blessed by it as well."
2,A surprising dissapointment,"Some of the members at my church raved on how awesome the album is and how it was a must buy. So I bought it. I listened to a couple of songs and couldn't even finish the CD. I asked them if they were talking about Confessions of a Worshipper, because I thought I got the wrong CD. They told me that I had to listen to it a couple of times and it would grow on me. I listened to it some more, and still couldn't finish it. I agree that Lamar Campbell's voice is irritating. Get others to lead. PLEASE!!! There will only be one Fred Hammond."
5,Squirrels evicted!,"We had a problem with squirrels in our old garage. Each season there were more and more moving in over the last 5 yrs. It was beginning to smell and no matter how we tried to close up any entry holes they still found a way in. We bought this product and within days the squirrels moved out. We waited until March 1st. so that it wasn't freezing outside when we evicted them. We have not seen a squirrel since! Wonderful, humane product. Since the garage is packed with stuff, we bought a larger one, square footage wise, then we needed. It is working great."
5,GONE!,"I plugged this in and haven't heard a scurry in the attic yet!This unit is great, before we bought this unit we would hear the little guys jump off the palm trees onto the roof, then soon they were in the attic doing their daily run on the race track (or so they thought) above. No more mice or rats now. Highly recommended."
1,Just a piece of plastic,"These don't work at all. I placed one in the outlet in the kitchen right next to where the mice like to hide out (as well as one in my daughter's room on the 2nd floor) and they just scurry by as if it did nothing. I have waited to do this review for almost a month and if I had seen at least a small reduction in the mice population, my review would have more of a glow to it. All these things do is use energy without giving me the results I desire. Now I'm stuck with two units that don't work. I am likely to purchase pest repellers that are more on the commercial level, as they appear to be far more productive than this unit. Buyer, learn from my mistake and look elsewhere for effective pest control."
3,Not sure yet,"Unit is silent as indicated but I'm not sure it works for the baby geckos that invade my home. Found one in the same room as this unit a few days after plugging it in. Perhaps given time, it'll prove effective but for immediate effect the Stinger unit has proved best."
3,Had to have it for a fluff class,"otherwise I'd never have read this book. Honestly the way it's formated drove me nuts. I didn't care for it, I really didn't need this class but was told I did. I got rid of the book immediately after the class was over.I have college books I've held onto because I felt I learned something and actually enjoyed the book. this is not one of them."
2,B movie at best,"I'm not exactly sure how this movie got 4 1/2 stars because it is 2 stars at best. When I see 4 1/2 starts I'm thinking movies like The color purple, love jones, Ray, etc. etc. This movie is a B movie, not the type of movie that gets to the theatres, which is why this one didn't make it. I wouldn't buy this movie, I would rent it if you are really interested."
1,Complete garbage!!!,"I gave this movie one star because I couldn't choose to give it 0 stars. From the beginning of the movie it made no sense. The acting was shotty at best, even by great talents like Blair Underwood and Regina King. The plot and sequence were choppy and shallow. This movie didn't make me think at all, and the outcome was very unrealistic. It seemed as if they threw in plot twists to shake things up a bit, but it just made things worse.Maybe this movie would have been good if I had been high, but I'm sorry I wasted my money in this trash, not even worthy of being used as toilet paper. It will be a table coaster -- like K-Pax."
5,Deeply moving!,"I had the honor of attending Lois Roma-Deeley's reading at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe, Arizona, last Friday evening. I was deeply moved several times during the evening by the power and purity of this brilliant poet's words. I had a similar reaction a month ago on September 11, 2006, when I heard the world premiere of an oratorio based on Roma-Deeley's four-part poem from this collection, called ""Voices From the Aftermath: New York City Requiem."" The 600 people who attended the two commemorative performances must have felt the same way, as the poet and her composer collaborator, Christopher Scinto, received resounding standing ovations at both occasions. Every time I read northSight, I am moved to tears. This book is a gift not only to the poetic world but to all who seek truth and beauty."
1,???,"Bought this as an anniversary gift with a book... it's musak! Pure, unadulterated spacey musak. TOTALLY disappointed. Not what I was expecting."
2,Not Very Pleasant Secondary Notes,"The fragrance's primary notes are fresh and pleasant but the secondary notes tend to remind me of inexpensive, bad quality fragrances. I would definitely not purchase again."
5,Netsuke: Japanese Life and Legend in Miniature,"There are a lot of high quality photographies of very wonderful netsuke, interesting design, good advice how to do the photographies of small netsuke better! This book is very good for beginning carvers, galleries!"
2,Harder than it should be,"I've been spoiled by the ease of use of Microsoft products and am about to give up on trying to use this software. Very difficult to alter designs of walls and roofs. You need an advanced CAD degree just to figure out how to make a roof. Probably good for the seasoned professional, but not a good product for the ""do it yourselfer""."
1,Stick with version 4!,"This version is awful! It is clunky, lacks many of the features of version 4 and is slow to learn. There are fewer furniture/fixture items and the graphics are worse. I hope they don't do this again or I'll have to stick with version 4 forever.If you are looking for a good home design program try 3D Home Architect Deluxe 4.0. It is great and easy to learn."
1,Useless software,"I've used Home Architect 3/4 for years, and upgraded to 5.0 to be compatible with my Windows 2000. What a shocker. Not only has the interface totally changed, it is TOTALLY COUNTER INTUITIVE. To add insult to injury, the user documentation is useless - some of the worst I have ever seen, and speaking as a professional tech writer, I've seen a lot!Unless you actually developed this product and *know* how it works, or are married to one of their tech support folks, don't waste your money on this product. Get one of the earlier Home Architect versions - they are great. Or check out the Chief Architect home version (referred to in an earlier review)."
1,CRASH,I've used CAD programs written in the 80's that are better than this. I'll go back to Drawing Board 1.0 over this thing. Not user friendly. I can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing. JUNK
1,Horrible program,"I bought this before seeing the other bad reviews. I can easily believe this is a complete rewrite, instead of being based on the previous program. I had an old version, maybe 1.0, and it was far more usable!Hard to do:- selecting an object to move or delete. I keep clicking, it keeps not selecting.- cameras - can't figure out how to view through them. My old version was quite usable, I could see neat 3D views of a room.- the rotation stuff very hard to view in 3D. Graphics may be nice, but it's impossible to go where I want, without getting motion sick.- Couldn't make stairs the right width. No apparent settings. They either were too narrow, or stuck through a wall, not allowing me to use the wall on the other side in another room. I could adjust lenght, tread, etc, but not the width of themI'm giving up, now that I can see its just a badly designed rewrite, not a real upgrade. Sigh! I really liked the old program!"
1,Not even worth one star.,"The software is simply useless as is the Customer Service department and the ""documentation."" I spent lots of time trading emails with the ""Office of The President"" in an attempt to get some insight into this product. All I got was double talk and a chief technician who answered only the questions he wanted to - not the questions I needed answered- just the ones he wanted to. Even after I enquired about a refund I was told my purchase was made over 90 days ago. It didnt' matter that there was an update to the software which rendered it even more useless.I had version 1.x which was a very bare bones version of this newest travesty written by a different set of software developers. It worked great. Don't waste your money on this or any other product Broderbund is hawking."
1,Version 3.0 is much easier to use.,"Dimply put, Not worth a penny, not backward compatible, not user friendly, the object catalogs are to small, and if you want to better it, you have to pay more.............."
1,From sugar to ...,I upgraded from version 3.0. My files do not work in 5.0. I think that it is the responsibility of the software publisher to inform the public that their new versions are not compatible with older versions. The new version doesn't have any of the same behavior as the old. I tried to make new plans and I was fighting the software. I'm going back to version 3.
1,Worst computer program I ever bought,"I had a early version of 3D Home Architect that worked great. I bought a new computer, and for some reason it didn't think I had enough space on my hard drive (although I had way more than I did with my old computer). I bought this new version of 3d Home Architect, and realize I totally wasted my money.The manual might as well have been written in Swahili. Do youself a favor, and buy something else."
1,Even Version 1.0 was better!,"After years on the shelf I dusted off the original version of 3D home Architect to draw some plans for a bathroom remodel. That old version ran amazingly well considering it was designed for Windows 95. Thirsting for more power, I ordered 3D Home Architect version 5.0. What a joke. This is probably the worst piece of software I have ever owned. All of the rendering capability is really neat, but when you cannot even finish a floorplan without endless complications, like pocket doors that place as double doors by default and then never return the space in the wall when you change to a single door, or like different dimensions when you automatically dimension exterior walls than you see when you try to drag a wall to edit it. I have spent an entire day with the program and have only finished the perimeter of my home. This program is a total waste, save your money."
1,Don't Buy,"If you don't have version 4.0, go buy it, do not buy this program. I did before I seen these other reviews. It is not the same program as older versions of 3D Home Architect and it is very hard to learn. The learning curve is not worth it even if your able to get it. Stay with 4.0"
1,Useless software,"To start, the wall utility in this software is innacurate. Unless, you adjust the settings to draw within the nearest foot you will not be able to draw a wall of desired length. Even with the feature called the commander, which is supposed to allow you to enter the length and rotation angle of a wall, errors are present. For example, I typed in the information for a 40' wall and it produced one 40'2"". And the six powerful rendering tools it promises, only 2 are available with this version. It doesn't even produce a detailed quantities list or plans check like the earlier version. I have a master's in civil engineering and do design work/CADD work on a daily basis, and have worked on both of the major CADD systems so I know what a good design program is."
1,"Very, very sad","Do not buy this product. It is NOT the next gen of the previous version. I have never, ever been so completely unhappy with a software purchase before in my life. And forget about tech support... all they do is try to sell you an upgrade. *sigh*"
1,Please do not buy,All they had to do is update the library with a broader range and more contemporary items. The interface should have never been touched. Unfortunately this is near impossible to use.
1,One Star Too Many!,"I am an experienced software used, and a past design draftsman; I have used all types of graphical software, but, this was the worst I have ever seen. Nothing works as it is supposed to, and when you check out the manuals or help, all you get is the same very limited information. I tried to create a second floor, but in spite of everything I tried, couldn't find our how to make the stairs extend through to the upper level.One additional item - the catalog of furnishings is so limited, its worthless. And the architectural items are even worse - there isn't even a standard patio door!I went back to Version 3.0 - easier to use, better library, and the software actually works.I always trusted Broderbund for providing quality software at decent prices, but they should be ashamed for even offering this garbage. I have lost confidence in this company."
1,Garbage,"Complicated and cumbersome. It was a waste of time and money. There are easier CAD packages for the casual, home user."
1,not better than the previous version,"I never use this software because when they upgrade most software, it seems they just make it more complicated, change the original way it's set up to confuse you, and really aren't making anything ""better"" or ""easier"".""2 THUMBS DOWN ON 3D HOME ARCHITECT 5.0"""
1,Don't buy this,Do not buy this product. Especially if you are a user of version 4. Its impossible to list all the short comings. it is cumbersome. automatically asumes to much. way to complicated. You'll find online support to have missing and bad URL's. I used version 4.0 to design and build my daughters house and cabinetry. It is a lot freindlier. Version 5.1 is a night mare of menus. right and left clicks and digging for answers.
1,"""Upgrade?"" - NOT","When Broderbund, the distributor of the 3D home series moved to Version 5.0, they also switched authors of the software. This program is completely different than all previous versions AND incompatible. It is harder to use as well. Stick with 4.0, or better yet, upgrade to the home version of Chief Architect, which is the compatible upgrade to all previous 3D Home Architect products."
1,"Bad, bad upgrade.","This version (done by a different developer) is counter intuitive, buggy and missing many of the most important features of the previous versions. STAY AWAY! I bought the ""professional"" version, spent many hours trying to learn how to use it and found it to be a complete waste of money. If you can find it in a store Version 4 is a great buy. Broderbund has made a huge mistake with this one."
1,3d Home Architect 5.0 nightmare software,"Having used 3D Home Architect 4.0 I assumed 5.0 was an enhancement of the same product. WRONG WRONG WRONG. Apparently Broderbund broke its alliance with the makers of version 4.0 and decided to do it alone . WHAT A MISTAKE. This software is way to hard to use, Full of BUGS and constantly crashed my computer. DO NOT BUY IT. Use 4.0 if you can find it. To bad Chief Architect do not have a cheap upgrade to 4.0."
1,WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?,"One reviewer says that Broderbund denies that it published Version 5.0 ... is version 5.0 a counterfeit? I don't understand what happened but I do know that Version 5.0 is awful. It looks like it would take weeks to understand. I gave up, thinking that I would try again when I had more time. Luckily, I have since read the reviews here and can see that I wasted my money. Did Bruderbund really do this to us? I loved all the other versions, and put the Bruderbund website on my favorites list. I feel burnt."
1,Much worse than version 3.0 and incompatible,"I have used version 3.0 quite a lot. This program is not close to as good, and was incompatible with my older drawings."
1,Dissappointing at the least,"I purchased 3D Home Architect 5.0 and later upgraded to 3D Architect 5.1. The form says rate this product from 1 to 5 stars but if there was a ""0"" this is what I would give it. The software has many design functions for creating your own home or remodling a room. However the software is very unstable. After hours of working on my project (restarting 4 seperate times) the program simply locks up or becomes corrupt. Tools work sometimes and somtimes they don't. There is absolutely NO consistency to the program. I called Tech support several times and they are clueless to the functionality of their own product.BUYER BEWARE......... STAY AWAY!!!"
1,3d HOME ARCHITECT 5 MISSED THE BOAT,"This product doesn,t support Windows 98unless you have Windows 98 SEI have never bought a product that supportsonly 98Se and newer operating systems.I guess Broderbund wants to be on the bandwagonwhen 98 goes away but that will be a long long timesince about 90 percent of the world is still using win98."
4,Simply eye-popping!,"I have never used previous versions of this software, so I can't comment on the upgrade issues mentioned here, but ten minutes after I started using this software, I had walls, doors, windows and a roof.When my nine year old saw the result, she started drawing plans for a Barbie house!I have encountered a glitch or two, but for the money, this package rocks!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"There is a problem with this software regarding overlapping items - I tried to delete a wall that was partially overlapping another wall and every time I tired it caused my PC to crash. Broderbund are aware of this problem because they told me that the file had become corrupt because of this overlapping problem. In short, the software allows you to overlap an item which in turn may cause the file to become corrupt. I spent over 2 hrs talking to their technical dept. (they don't have an 800 number so you better have a good long distance plan!). I finally returned it and am waiting for a refund."
1,Broderbund Bombs AGAIN,"Just installed ""deluxe"" 5.0 only to find (as have many others, it appears) that is is not an upgrade. This is not the first problem I've had with Broderbund software. However, this is the last time I'll ever purchase this brand!Wish I had checked out these reviews before I paid my $... to Broderbund for an ""upgrade."""
1,NOT USER-FRIENDLY,"I had a 3D Home Actitect program that I bought almost 10 years ago. It was much easier to use. Frankly I was extremely disappointed in this ""new and improved"" version. I feel it was a waste of my money and will go back to the old version. If you're a do-it-yourselfer, I'd suggest skipping this product."
1,Dissappointed Broderbund can't do any better than that.,"I wanted to upgrade to 5.0, I find no upgrade and now I read these reviews.I want to thank those who took the time to fill out the reviews, I had this program in the shopping cart. I will empty my shopping cart and head for home. Will not buy the 5.0, I will stick with my 3.0 and load it on my new computer. Many many Thanks to all."
2,Don't buy it,This program is not an update of 3D Home Architect 4.0. It is an entirely different program. A program that appears not to be able to run for more than a few minutes without locking. If you are thinking of upgrading from an earlier version I would not recommend it.
1,garbage,I have to echo the reviewer who said his 10-year old version is superior. I upgraded from 3d home architect circa 1995 and have found this new version to be a step backwards. The help section and tutorial are so incomplete it makes learning the non-intuitive controls a real chore.
5,This is a great book for die-hard Vol fans,"I really dug this book. It looks great on my coffee table at work and everyone always picks it up. I also like ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football."" It's a good one too.I highly recommend both titles.Go Vols!"
3,Catchy Party Track Let Out Of The Cage,"Yes, Athena Cage is yet another diva-in-training who has debuted these past few months with a hot party tune (Christina Milian, Toya, and Olivia all spring to my mind.) Album and radio versions of the track have very little difference, both are the same good time party tune. Also included are snippets of tracks from her upcoming album debut ""The Art of A Woman"" - a catchy enough Darkchild-by-numbers tune called ""All I Need Is Me"" and a tiresome ballad entitled ""Dream Lover"". Not a bad single release by any means, but the generic album snippets don't boost my interest on her upcoming album in any way at all, so I'll have to wait and see if she follows up with another good tune after this one. I'll be waiting, Ms. Cage."
2,"Good Food, no results","I saw this woman as a guest on another cooking show. She seemed enthusiastic, the host was enthusiastic, and together they produced 2-3 recipes from this book.I found a copy on Amazon (new/used) for about the cost of postage, and ordered it.I have NEVER prepared a dish from this book. Despite the ""30 Minute"" and ""One Dish"" chapters, there isn't a single recipe in this book that has even *tempted* me to try to prepare it.Save your money. This book adds nothing to your kitchen (or to your repertoire) ... even if you can get a copy for USD 3. Having read it now (several times) I wonder whatever it was that I originally found interesting.It's worthless."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a more in depth description of plays, rather than fullback goes at #2. How does the fullback get there? I was a little disappointed after hearing so much about Coach Raymond, that he would publish something like this. Anyone can draw up plays."
4,You must have it anyway!,"Professionally there is some other better products, but if the computer animation is boring you and if you wanna rediscover the real pencil sign of the great artists behind the camera, this one is about. Enjoy it! That's all folks!"
4,"Great, but ""His Best"" sounds MUCH better","this is great stuff as all of the reviewrs have noted, but if you want a truly remastered sound try starting with ""HIS BEST"" on the Chess label. much of the same songs, and WAAAAAY better sound. the songs he wrote himself on the first 1/2 of the CD are the best ones."
5,Two great albums for the price of 1.,Every song is great on these two albums on one disc Howlin Wolfs voice is very powerful and deep what great artists. Hubert Sumlins guitar playing is great and he is one of the best blues guitarists ever that has picked up a axe. Buy this trust me it's awesome if not I suggest you buy Wolf's box sets because without Wolf in your collection the blues ain't complete.Also without hearing the amazing tone and guitar playing of Sumlin your collection aint complete.
3,problems,"This could obviously just be the camera I received, but twice in the past nine months the camera has shut down with the lens fully extended and cannot be turned back on (I bought the AC adapter, tried every kind of battery under the sun, etc.). It had to be returned to Minolta for service both times. I won't be buying another Minolta.Having said that, the camera does take very high quality pictures when used properly and has a lot of features. It's a little slow between photos and eats batteries but these are common complaints with many digital cameras.Check out the Nikon Coolpix line. Both My brother and my sister-in-law just received the Coolpix 4800 as a gift and they both love it."
3,it broke,"i love the quality of the pictures, and it'sfun to use, but the motor broke beyond repair right after the warantee was over. wouldn't buy another one."
4,Almost Perfect,"Two choices when i wanted to buy a digcam:Dimage F100 or Sony Cybershot DSC-P9. both 4MP, similar design, weight and size. Minolta is ($$$) cheaper but no AC adaptor, charger and rechargeable batteries. these cost about ($$$). So no big difference. so far, the pic quality is perfect and it is very easy to use."
1,One picture fits on card supplied with camera.,"I purchased this camera without much thought- my bad. I took one picture and it wouldn't take another. Long story short, my vendor supplied the camera with an 8 mb memory card and after one picture it couldn't take another without that picture being deleted. It is supposed to come with a 16 mb card, which would not be much better. The product description says the 16mb card will hold 14 images. Do you really want a camera that will only hold 14 images? I tried plugging in a 512kb card and it would't take it. Don't know why anyone would be as dumb as me and buy this thing. I don't know what the picture quality is like, I would have had to buy the cable, because I didn't get one. Be sure and read the fine print of what you are getting- don't assume!"
2,Broke in less than a year,"The camera is very fragile and the on/off dial is not secure at all, it tend to turn on if in your pocket or bag, result is mine got open in my bag and now the lense is stuck.Hopefully the one year guarantee will cover it."
2,MINOLTA F100 Observations,"A very attractive, solid-feeling little camera, as compact as one might wish. After about six months use, these shortcomings noted: (i) the menus are virtually invisible in outdoor light; (ii) the OFF position of the mode dial is not secure; the camera can be turned on and the lens turret extended in purse or pocket by inadvertant jostling, which may damage the mechanism; (iii) the autofocus feature lacks an infrared beam projector, making autofocusing inexact in poor light; (iv) the disparity between image capture via optic viewfinder and LCD frame is very large; (v) in common with many in its class, the camera's operation although extremely flexible is very complex."
3,"Good product, bad details","In general, I like this camera, but I have one major complaint. (You can read about other complaints in the rest of the reviews.) The file memory feature is sub-par on this camera. Basically, if your batteries die, your file memory function will reset itself, and the numbering gets screwy. It seems minor, but it's a real pain if you like to have all of your pictures numbered nicely, and honestly, Minolta should have designed their camera with this simple thing in mind."
1,Pick another brand,"I have had my camera for just over one year and it has developed two major problems in that time and is currently inoperable. It has a problem with the lens not retracting and the camera losing function. (note: this is unrelated to the battery replacement issue outlined in the owner's manual). I sent it in the first time to be repaired and after a few weeks received it back. Then I developed the same problem again and it was just slightly past the year mark and the warranty had expired. I called them up and explained either something is wrong with my particular camera or it is a flaw in the product. They would only say that the base rate for repair was $110 and could go up from there. Konica Minolta was unwilling to do anything else. I would pick a brand 1. with a more reliable product and 2. that stands behind the products they make. This is a pretty camera and has some nice features, but then other brands have the same features and looks without the quality problems."
3,"Good camera, but not for action shots","This is my first digital camera. I have been a film guy for 30+ years and have lots of 35mm equipment.The picture quality is better than I expected. I regularly do 8X10s, and if you don't compress the files, they look pretty good.My only complaint is that the camera takes forever to turn on, turn off, focus and shoot. I'm used to getting candid and action shots ""from the hip"", and have missed many opportunities with this camera.I have had no mechanical, electronic or optical problems."
5,Minolta quality tradition continues,"Once I got a hold of this camera, I was in love. Its easy to use, great design, and the quality of the pictures is superb. I waited a little while before jumping into the digital camera race, and this one was worth the wait! I would recommend it to both a beginner and a more experienced photographer."
4,Annoyed with Minolta ....,"The good: Great pictures, compact ergonomic design - classy. So far I am pleased with the camera.The bad: I am annoyed that Minolta choose not to package an AC adapter with this camera. Further - how about mentioning this little detail in the advertising so those purchasers like myself could order it. Here I am back at the Amazon site and guess what - no sign of the AC adapter - probably another $50 when I find one. Minolta even recommends this option (per their manual) when connecting to a computer!"
3,Mixed Blessings,"While the F100 is optically terrific and physically sized for convenience, the LCD monitor is vitually invisible in bright outdoor light. Also, the camera's housing is very fragile. Packing the F100 without a hard carrying case in a full backpack will likely dent the camera's housing and void the warranty."
3,And yet another perspective on Judy,I have read this book and also read through the other reviews and wonder how people reading the same thing come up with such different opinions. Mel Torme is definately presenting things from his perspective. That anyone could read the book and think Judy disrepected or disliked him is hard to swallow. They must not have read it very closely. It would be the reverse if anything but that would be a little hard to swallow too. He does show a little bitterness I think but overall expresses his overall thankfulness in having worked with her. Would I recommend this book? I think so. For us Judy fans it is good to get everyone's perspective who knew her well.
5,Mel's the best.,"I had read ""It Wasn't All Velvet"" and wished there was more written by Mel. So I was very pleased to find this little gem. It is an easy read, and quite revealing. As a matter of fact, if you are a Judy Garland fan, you might want to read something else."
2,There is better information out there about Miss Garland,"Mel Torme writes about his time as a writer of Special Material on the very troubled Judy Garland television series. He uses his insider's position to self-promote at the expense of the Legendary singer. The sad after-taste left by this memoir is that Mr. Torme, a legend in his own right, has reduced himself to the level of a tabloid reporter."
1,Jealousy is an evil force.,"Gosh, I just think Mel Torme had such tremendous jealousy, he was so frustrated by Judy there was nothing he could do but wring his drumsticks and write this book.I'm sure Judy saw him as someone she could trod over? squish like a toad?Indeed, Torme's entire approach to the writing is toad-like, while needing that association and recongition from a LEGEND. (Now who is this guy?) Well, maybe if Judy had slept with him, he could have bemoaned that too."
1,It's NOT what you expect...,"I ordered this item as an economical approach to a color inkjet refill but what I received was complete junk. First, be aware that these are recycled inkjet cartridges - they are NOT new (which would have been nice to know up front). The one I received was manufactured in 2005.The bigger issue - the cartridge was sent to me EMPTY - NO INK!! I needed this for a critical project - so imagine my surprise when I went to install it. The ink reservoir plugs had been punched, but it looks like this one skipped the refill and went straight to shipping. I wound up running to the store at 11pm to get a cartridge that actually had ink in it.... Unless you buy ink cartridges for the thrill of guessing if they will work - take a pass..."
2,"Great works, lackluster performance","The other reviewers here have done well discussing the quality of the works represented on this CD. I will not endeavor to add more.The recording, however, features VERY lackluster performances by choir and orchestra. The choir sings without giving to the text any sense of connection or textual phrasing. For example, the choir sounds like: ""THE - GOD - WHO - GAVE - US - LIBERTY...,"" instead of: ""The God who gave LIBERTY."" Every quarter note should not sound the same; rather, the text should be sung musically with a sense of oratory. All quar-ter-notes-should-not-be-equal.The orchestra sounds pretty, but doesn't have much spark or energy to give the performance an engaging sense.If you can, find another recording for these great works. You'll be glad you did."
4,Testament of Freedom,This CD provides an excellent presentations of two of Randall Thompson's best works. There is an interesting contrast in putting both Frostiana and the Testament of Freedom on the same CD. Testament of Freedom is full blooded patriotic and is likely to produce a lump in the throat. Frostiana is much lighter and fun to both perform and hear. I liked both works very much.
2,Strong agreement with Ryan Kelly's review.,"I sensed that this music was good, possibly very good - but it was hurt so much by the detrimental performance on this CD. The diction and musicality in the Jefferson is grading, plodding, and difficult to listen to. A performance of the masterful words of Jefferson should have been more thoroughly thought out, directed to emphasize the important words, unique cadence, etc."
2,you get what you pay for!!!,Cassette players are hard to come by and I wanted one to play tapes without the earphones. Books are best on the tapes. However this item does not work on the battery mode. Tried everything to get them to make contact and work. The machine still functions by plugging it in. but not what I had in mind when purchasing it. I am sorry I did not return it and then investing in a better product.
2,You get what you pay for,This item lasted less than six months before it started eating my tapes. Junk.
1,horrible,"I should have known when you cant find these anymore this price was too good to be true. And it was. This is a piece of junk.......No sound when tape was played.ON the great side, the company is awesome to work with and readily agreed to take it back for a full refund. They did make me pay for shipping however, which on this was more then I would have liked.I have had gx before and never have I seen anything this bad. The company is great to work with however, so dont let the product deter you from them."
2,You get what you paid for,"I paid few dollars for this item, so I got the quality that I paid for.I was able to listen to my old cassettes but some of them got block up while listening, so the cassette was spoiled."
5,Incorrectly Stated,"If you have the Canon S40, just set the timer to turn the camera off in the case. The camera will turn off after the alloted time. Then you just push the shutter button and the camera will turn back on. Saving battery life."
5,Best Accessory Ever for the S45/S50,"I took this case with me during my Caribbean cruise and went climbing Dunns River Falls, snuba diving and snorkeling and it worked like a charm. I was able to take great shots underwater -- crystal clear too. My friend also bought the case and he too got great shots.One caution: Make sure you read and follow the directions when prepping your case. If you do that you'll have no problems whatsoever.Highly Recommended!!"
1,No warranty for a costly accessory that started cracking,"The case helped to take good underwater pictures but I noticed that there were cracks forming--not enough to leak--on the parts that I was frequently touching with my hand to hold. The next time I used it there were more lines appearing. When I called the Canon company, they said that they have no repair or warranty for their accessories."
5,Great for cookie jar!,"I got this bunny on a major sale (only paid $13 for it, thank you very much Amazon!) and got him in spectacular shape within the week. The only thing that kinda threw me is that unlike the vast majority of Mikasa Antique White Products, this bunny has very pale brown brushings to help accentuate his features. In person his detailing is so good I can see the ripples in his fur, the individual toes on all 4 paws, his tear drop shaped tail, and all of his features on his face from across the room. The pictures here don't do him justice.Great deal for 3 times what I paid, but very happy at the sale price I got!"
4,Still A Thrill,"This CD really put Jody Watley on the musical map. It had a nice variety of music that really fit the time and it still has a good feel many years later. If you were ever a fan of Jody, this is worth purchasing."
4,Jody Watley,It`s alright.The music is awesome.I however do not like her abbreviated versions of Don`t You Want Me&Some Kind Of Lover
5,i love jody!!!!,"""I'm lookin' for a new love, baby, a new love, yeah, yeah, yeah. Other guys will have me they'll appreciate my love tell me how does it feel? but now you're like the rest, unworthy of my best, hasta la vista baby!"" What a great song! Some kind of lover,Don't you want me,and Most of all are good songs also. This album is definitely worth buying."
5,CLASSIC JODY!!!!!,I LOVE THIS WOMAN SHE CAN SING AND SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.OF COURSE EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SHE FIRST STARTED OFF AS A SOUL TRAIN DANCER THEN BECAME A PART OF THE LEGENDARY GROUP SHALAMAR . I LOVE HER SOLO CAREER AS WELL MY FAVORITES ARE DON'T YOU WANT ME AND LOOKING FOR A NEW LOVE. BUT OVERALL IT IS A GOOD ALBUM. JODY SINGS AND DANCES VERY WELL ALSO. THIS IS A MUST HAE FOR ANY JODY WATLEY FAN.
5,"When ""SINGLES"" really mattered!!","""Back in the day"" artists released albums chocked full of potential hit singles and Watley's debut has no less than six that topped the charts in the late 80's.Tell me a performer today, other than Madonna and Janet Jackson, which can boast the same."
5,The brilliant beginning of a great career...,"...and it wasn't even really the beginning, per se. As the female lead of the 70s/80s soul-funk group Shalamar, she helped that group score some memorable singles during her five years with them. This would undoubtedly be some first-class training for her solo career, and on this 1987 solo debut, Jodi proves to be a fierce and fun diva of dance. Scoring five top 10 hits, most notably the frank, straight-to-the-point ""Looking For A New Love,"" and the more restrained but equally funky ""Don't You Want Me,"" (both of which still get fairly frequent airplay nowadays), this is one of the definitive dance-pop albums of the 80s, or of any era, and was the first in a one-two punch of successes for Jody in the 80s (her 1989 album ""Larger Than Life"" was also great both artistically and commercially). She underwent some style changes in the 90s, with a bit less success, but continued to have a long and respectable career into this decade."
1,Worthless anti-American drivel,"So far, I've only made it to page 50 but I don't even know if I want to go any further. The author is obviously a left wing, America hating, Bush bashing loon. Then he has the audacity to publish two novels aimed at the Christian audience. Will he include all his cursing and America hating in those novels as well. I'm sure he feels good when he genuflects to his Obama shrine every evening. Read Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, or Ted Bell instead. At least those guys love their country."
2,The Enemy Within,I read a trilogy Noel Hynd wrote. It was clean and good. I was anticipating a good book about a gov't conspiracy but I couldn't get through the tons of swear words and threw it away.
2,Surprisingly Different,"I bought this book after reading several of Hynd's newer, Christian-focused novels (See hereConspiracy in Kiev (The Russian Trilogy, Book 1)). I was shocked at the amount of cursing and foul behavior in this older one. Perhaps the author ""renounced his sinful ways"" as they say. I only know one thing: this book chokes down the breath of fresh air in the newer ones."
3,A Good plot but a little hard to follow,"The book itself had a good story going, but the info about the civil war confused things. It was slow going and I wouldn't reccomend that you read it unless the civil war is something that interests you. It does have a happy ending though, which is always good."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"This is by far my favorite gospel album of all time! Do yourself a favor and listen. Original, heartfelt lyrics will touch you. So many songs on this album you can relate to. Our Special Day is one of the most beautiful wedding songs I have heard. Beautiful City describes a vision of heaven. Music is so healing, and comforting. I really love this album and artist."
4,amazing,"This is a definiteve must have for any spiderfan. But, why four stars instead of five?. Well, I have been a long time fan, so I was a bit disappointed when I saw mistakes in the book. Little mistakes that is. For example, In the book is said that ol' Electro can generate up to 100.000 volts, when is officially stated that is 1'000.000. It's also mentioned that the Rhino's name has not been revealed, but it was, Alex O'him. I don't remember anymore. Oh, wait, the biggest one, the omission of The Shocker. I would have liked to see sections dedicated to the TV series, as is done in Ultimate X-men. But anyway, I am proud of this stuff."
4,Great reference book!,"""Spider-Man: The Ultimate Guide"" is a must-have book for all the wall-crawler's fan! It has information about lots of characters and a fantastic spidey's time-line! The illustrations are as good as well, and you can even find information on alternative Spider-Man series, like Spider-Girl, and Spidey 2099. Although the book is very nicely done i still missed more detailed profiles, anyway you will sure not regret for buying this one!"
3,Not really 3x9 pillar candles.,"I ordered the 3""x9"" pillar candles as we needed them for a wedding. However they are actually 2.8 inches and although that sounds like a small amount it makes a difference and they do not fit in the candles holders that we are suppose to use them in!! I have a message into candlemart and hope they will be responsive in a prompt manner."
1,Arrived broken.,"My candle arrived broken.I was able to press it back together and I'm burning it, I don't know how it will be when it burns down to the broken spot. It burns well and if I order again I'll order a shorter version."
3,Weakest link in dcTalk,"I like this record fairly well. But I reach for the Tobymac and Kevin Max albums more. It just fails to rise above the typical pop rock sound (think dcTalk's filler songs from Jesus Freak). In 5 years, this will be in bargain bins all over the place, and no one will remember it. Which is fine, since none of the albums were amazing enough to warrant dcTalk breaking up. They work best together, and I want all of Tait's obviously solid pop rock abilities to be blended with Toby Mac's hip hop skills and Kevin Max's knack for the ethereal. It's not bad, just not all that impressive either. Bland. Empty. (Good title after all)."
4,I like it!,"This album has one very important thing going for it. It's very very catchy. The first time through these songs I loved them and as time has passed I still do, for me that's a very good sign, usually if I like something right away it ends up becoming very annoying but this was not the case. A great first solo outing for 1/3 rd of dc talk, great soaring voice, and spiritual content, I like it!"
4,Great solo project.,This first time solo project was refeshing. Michael's roots of rock and roll really come through. I really love this album because it speaks of his trials. This is one of my favorite cds.
3,Not praise music,"This song was categorized under Christian Religious music. The singer has a really nice voice. There are about 4 songs I like from this CD. But I was looking for praise music. The singer seems to be singing ""about"" God and not ""to"" God, like praise music is supposed to. Some of the songs do not seem Christian related. They seem like he is singing about a person. But I like the music."
5,A spiritual journey,"Whistling in the Dark definitely came at a needed time in my spiritual journey. My Sunday School class introduced me to this work, and I am amazed that we have such honest intellectual spiritual help as found in this book. I highly recommend it."
4,Excellent for nurses,This book is an excellent reference for nurses to use to communicate with their Hispanic patients. I had never taken any spanish courses before and the material in the book was easy to understand and the cds that came with it helped with correct pronounciation. I highly recommend it!
3,spanish for nurses,"this was an easy to use set, but you have to keep up with it. I find I am learning more spanish just by listening to the spanish people around me and asking them how to say things."
2,Not Danner quality,"I bought these boots after ordering the wrong size directly from the company. I saw that they were almost $80 cheaper and thought I had found a deal. The boots I bought directly from Danner were top notch. The leather was stiff, polished, and looked awesome. Unfortunately they didn't fit, so I sent them back and ordered through Amazon. The discounted boots arrived and as soon as I opened the box I knew I made a mistake. The boots were dirty and the leather on both toes was scratched. Instead of stiff leather, the boots sagged. They appeared to have been worn or possibly reconditioned. I immediately sent them back and went to the Danner website to order the REAL boots. Be careful ordering these boots from this seller. Had they mentioned the boots were not factory new quality I would never have ordered them. Get the real deal from Danner!"
5,I loved it!!!,"Again, another one I bought just to see Stephane Bullion. He's so romantic and passionate in this one. There are some strong suggestions of sex, so I don't really reccomend this for children. It's not just Stephane that makes this good. The whole thing is good. I think it has a good storyline, too."
1,Try some other software,"I bought 3D Home Architect Pro 5.0 after seeing positive reviews. Oops, those were for earlier versions! Maybe those worked, but 5.0 doesn't. Nice features, but this program automatically closes itself on a regular basis, as others have reported. And not for lack of computer, this is on a 2.20gb P4 with 256 RAM and plenty of hard drive. Save your money and buy something else. I have Punch Home Design Pro Platinum now, which seems to have comparable features and at least lets me design something without crashing. I returned 3DHA 5.0 and got my money back, and you probably will too if you buy it."
1,Home Architect,"Definitely not a finished product. Extremely difficult to view interior as 3D. Compare with Version 3. Rendering takes forever on a 400MHz CPU, 256 megabyte ram. Help is of little help.Plus - installation come with a freebie that you may not want: DSSAGENT.EXE, a stealth link. Look it up."
1,Possibly the most user-unfriendly s/w I've ever used,I expected more from a s/w marketed by Broderbund.
1,Very disappointing,"I have used 3DHA deluxe 4 for several months. I love it. I thought 3DHA Professional 5 would be dynamite and could hardly wait go get it. What a disapointment. As several other reviewers have stated, this is a completely different interface. I do not fine it friendly at all. It has crashed once on me after I had finaly gotten my floor plan in. I had attempted to save it, but after the crash, my saved copy was not there. It does not calculate sq ft, or lay out the measurements in the plan. I am going back to Version 4. I doubt that Broderbund will give my money back, but I am going to ask."
1,What a Shame,"I have been a user of 3D Home Architect since its introduction making Drawings in our Business and for the most part pleased. I have used it for many Jobs about 150 Drawings. If these drawings can not be used in the Newer Versions, then Broderbund just lost a Customer."
4,i guess i'm the exception...,"i love this program. i design houses for a living, and then provide them to an architect for finalization. it does what i need it to do and i think it's wonderfully easy to use. i guess maybe my demands are not as high as others might have."
2,ATTENTION BRODERBUND 3D HOME ARCHITECT v4.0 OWNERS!!,"From the negative reviews of the 5.0 product, I decided to do some research on another product that was recommended: Chief Architect Home Edition 5.0 (or CAHE5).Apparently, the vendor who makes CAHE5 also made Broderbund's 3D Home Architect v4.0 product. But they did NOT make the new v5.0 software; it was sub-contracted out to another company. Probably explains the new interface and the fact that v5.0 is not compatible with v4.0 (you cannot import v4.0 designs).CAHE5 *is* compatible with 4.0, and it will import v4.0 files. The vendor says that CAHE5 is the true update to v4.0.FYI, The vendor also says that the next release of their software will be renamed to Better Homes and ""Home Designer Suite"" v6.0. It's available now, in fact....NOTE: I do not work for Chief Architect, Broderbund or any other computer company. I'm just a homeowner researching for the best home design software and I believe in sharing the knowledge.Regards,Roland Thomas"
3,Upgrade Warning!,"The fact that 3D Home Architect v.5.0 is not compatible with 3D Home Architect v.4.0 drawings is the single worst upgrade mistake you could make - and I paid the price (see Broderbund: Technical Note ID: 31665). Who's bright idea was that? Find them and tell them they should sell shoes - not technology products. You can give them my name and I'll be glad to them directly. Broderbund should know better. Even if the formats are different they should have created a migration tool. No excuses - they should have. The fact that I now must REDRAW all my work in order to take advantage of 5.0 features is insane. For their protection, other potential Broderbund customers should know about this total lack of customer support perpetrated by their company. Too bad. I really thought Broderbund had it together."
1,This version is horse crap. Pitiful and useless....,"I used a previous version on my old computer and had no difficulty. Apparently, I've lost intelligence in the past year and a half, as I cannot get this version to cooperate. You draw on the 2nd floor and the walls show up on the 1st. How'd that happen? I'd love to know. I gave up trying to draw from scratch, which I did before on the previous version, and began trying to modify an example model. Bugs are everywhere. I want my money back. I'm not a computer software engineer, but I do have a Mechanical Engineering degree and I can't use this piece of feces."
4,Powerful beyond belief,"As a user of 3D Home Architect 4.0, I was a little miffed at first to find the interface 5.0 change from 4.0. As I spent a little time with the more complex interface, I realized that the new power of this program was awesome!New features I found included curved walls, multiple 3D Views, and real-time navigation, features that were not possible with the old version. The new roofing creates the most complex shapes roofs I could ask for, with curved, multi-faceted and multi-sloped roofs with multiple plate heights.I inserted skylights, curve-top windows, doors and created complex structures, not possible with 4.0. Objects that I did not find in the database, I easily imported from 3DS files that I found on the internet.This upgrade was definitely worth the money and worth the slightly larger learning curve."
1,Bug ridden,"I wasted [money] on a program that rarely stays running long enough for me to save my work. So much for version 5, this has beta written all over it. I virtually never see other programs crash on my computer, so I thought I'd check to see if Broderbund offered a fix. Unfortunately there's nothing available so I'm going to try Chief Architect Home Edition 5.0 at least then I'll be able to open my Home Architect V4 files."
3,GOOD SERIES,"I own a previous version of this program (3.0) and if the series continues as it has, this program should be excellent. I just ordered it and im sure it will be the best yet."
2,4.0 is much better,"I agree w/ other reviews, 4.0 is much better. The only exception that I have found so far is that 5.0 has a more powerful rendering engine. 5.0 is not as flexible, I haven't yet found a way to specify the height at which a window is placed so I can't put a window in a gable end of a roof. Also the help system is much weaker than 4.0. This software is not much more than a toy. It is easy to learn and use so if a quick representation is all that is needed, it will work but 4.0 is still better even for that."
1,crash city,"I have yet to get this program to run; I have tried it on several different computers running windows xp - an hp and a emachines; both have pentium processors and 512 k ram; when the program crashes, it brings down then entire xp operating system! use at your own risk; this is not functional software unless your computer does not used shared memory for video, there are no patches or support updates for this problem, and you have to dig deep into broderbunds site to get a clue as to what's going on; I'm sticking with version 3, as weak as that was"
1,"Really poor, too bad I can't give partial star ratings","I have spent hours just trying to figure out how to create an element (aluminum) with its own measurements to design a screen porch. Althougth there are instructions on creating an element (and I am usually good at following them) they were not clear and even included ""try this"" phrases as if they expected me to be having trouble. One direction suggested importing the item from online but gave no sites to go to and so far I have not been able to find one. This program is definately not designed for blueprinting or those with only ten years experience on computers. Though intriguing to my wife (she can try different ideas and looks) it will certainly take a month for her just to figure out how to get to the point of finishing touches she would be interested in. If anyone can change my mind with some advice, I'll type in a humble retraction, but so far this has been a huge waste of my time."
1,Save your money,"I had used Version 3.0 for a while, and expected this to be an upgrade. No way; it's so full of bugs it's unusable. Some of the features would be great if they worked, but they don't. Forget it."
1,"So far, A complete Disaster!",The program has now caused my Dell Computer (which exceeds all requirements for this program) to crash twelve times! Broderbund support on the telephone requires 20 minute waits & closes at 3pm Pacific Time. I'm still attempting to just get this program to run - very frustrating!!!
1,Terrible Disappointment,"I purchased this program because I believed it to be a an upgradeof the previous versions, which were based on the professional software ""Chief Architect"". The new version is based upon a completey difference program by Cadsoft. I believe this program would be good at rendering a room with furniture but I found it terrible for transferring my design from version 4. I called the company that produces ""Chief Architect"" and they said they will be offering a consumer level program next year (The professional software is aobut $1000.) I was very disappointed."
4,THE history of the Second United States Cavalry,"This is an exceptional work for any historian of the US Cavalry, Seminole War, Frontier, Morman War, Mexican War, and Civil War. This is the regimental history written by the man who lived it first hand and is extremely detailed in all respects, originally published in 1876(?) it has never been reprinted till now and previously copies were kept under lock and key in libraries. Almost every book ever written about the US Cavalry has this book listed in its bibliography. This book again is a must for Civil War era historians and is all first hand accounts!"
3,purchase,"Cannot give much of a review as this was a Christmas gift for two granddaughters.I was very happy with the service, my selection was easy and delivery was excellent.Thank You"
4,easily their best album,"Skip the first and last tracks (lackluster instrumentals) and you won't be disappointed with the remaining ten songs. This is easily the New Amsterdams' best album, picking up everything good about The Get Up Kids, leaving behind the whiny slowness of their last two albums and bringing in some intelligent more grown up lyrics. There are some standouts - Spoils of the Spoiled and Hanging on For Hope are my favorites, but overall it is a solid album from #2-#11."
3,"The New Amsterdams ""Worse For The Wear""","""Vignette"" 3/5""The Spoils Of The Spoiled"" 4/5""Hover Near Fame"" 4/5""From California"" 3/5""Hanging On For Hope"" 3/5""The Smoking Gun"" 4/5""Are You True"" 3/5""Asleep At The Wheel"" 4/5""Poison In The Ink"" 4/5""All Our Vice"" 3/5""Worse For The Wear"" 3/5""Slight Return"" 3/5The New Amsterdams is the side project of Get Up Kids singer Matt Pryor. He crafts catchy pop songs with great hooks. Unlike the boisterous emo that the Kids are known for, the New Amsterdam create piano driven tunes. Highlights include ""The Spoils Of The Spoiled"" and ""The Smoking Gun.""Overall rating: Three and a half stars."
3,Not bad,"Is it just me or does the beginning of ""Are You There"" sound eerily similar to tha John Mayer song?"
4,Live at Union Chapel,"I had seen the video of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" on Youtube, which lead me to discover the DVD concert ""Live at Union Chapel"". I bought the DVD just for that one song, but I have to say that I enjoyed all of the other pieces as well ( almost all of them anyway ). Gary Brooker gives a great interview and delivers a masterful rendition of AWSOP. Loved it."
5,Another gem from Procol,"I recently purchased 2 Procol Harum DVDs. I believe I may have purchased the best two available. (the other being with an orchestra). Terrific sound quality! Wondeful song selection with several songs I have not heard before, but enjoyed them just as much as the songs I did."
4,Interesting cortex skewerings.,Chang is focused and tactile. She is inside the composer's motor cortex. I must say however that the Messiaen compositions remind me of the random shards my mom (she had no formal training) could flail out of the little Steinway console after having nipped away half the cooking Sherry. What was she thinking? I'll never know.
1,inaccuracies a plenty,When I actualy reviewed Mr Morey's research material I found he quoted out of context his sources quite often and his quotes from the Quran could in some cases not be found or were simply inaccurate. Mr. Morey's inability to read Arabic makes me wonder how he can possibly even think he has any grasp on Islam.
3,"Often simple, though it looks at a number of issues","Despite often being vague, ""The Islamic Invasion"" touches on a whole (large) range of issues and topics concerning Islam."
1,Christian propaganda,"I read this book in hopes of reading an objective work on Islam. Right away, I could see that it was nothing but propaganda.The following passage has no right being in an objective work: ""When you study the speeches of Jesus as given in the Gospels...you find that Jesus was the greatest speaker that ever lived. Even His enemies has to confess that no man spoke as He spoke.""Oh really? Were any of us there to hear Jesus speak and/or to speak with his enemies to hear their opinions? Even if you were there, it would still be your opinion and not fact like this book makes it out to be.This is just one example of many statements in this book that are presented as facts, but in reality are only the opinion of the writer. I recommend it only to people who are studying propaganda and how it is used to manipulate uneducated minds."
1,Lies,"In all honesty, this is a book of Sh** and lies coming from the weak mind of an ignorant, disctriminative jackass. Taking quotes out of context, Mr. Morey, and using them to support your blind claims, is something that I would expect from a ten year old, uneducated, evil, arrogant, fearful and most importantly misquided human being. I feel sorry that you can't realize that we are all trying to get to one place-Paradise-and our role on Earth isn't what you think it is. With all due respect, go to Hell."
1,Islamic Invasion=Lies,"I do not recommend this book to anyone. Any educated or partially educated Muslim will laugh at this book, as they will easily be able to point out the errors and unfounded facts found in almost every sentence. I think one star is too much for this book. Allah does not mean moon god any person with any knowledge of Islam or Arabic would know that. He can make no legitimate claim against Islam. If some one really wants to learn about Islam they can pick up a Quran with a good translation or read books from John Espisito. This book is written by a religious fanatic for religious fanatics who like to put down other religions. The author is obviously either ignorant or likes to publish lies."
1,"Offensive, Clearly Biased, and Poorly Argued","I have never read a more childish book against Islam in my life.The author makes fun of Muslims for acting in the way of Muhammad, yet doesn't Christianity teach the same thing, saying to use Jesus as an example of a good way of life?He claims that Muslims worship a moon God, because of the name Allah and the moon symbol, but the name Allah comes from Aramaic and the symbol was created long after Islam (and for political reasons). He claims that the Quran is flawed and therefore must be wrong, but historians have found the bible has flaws as well. He inserts opinion and tries to claim it as fact, saying the speech of Jesus is beautifull, but that of Muhammad and the Quran is silly.And he expects us to take this argument seriously?If anyone tries to challenge Islam using this book as a basis for their argument, God (or Allah) help them."
1,Deceptions of moon-god theory,"I found the section about Allah being moon-god full of errors and deceptions. Perhaps authors doesn't know that Quran calls moon a creation of God and instructs the believers to niether worship sun nor moon. Did moon-god created moon? Given that the Aramaic word for God is Alaha, then using twisted logic of author, it could be proved that Jesus also worshiped moon god. And the Arab Christian even today address God as Allah. Are they also worshiping moon-god?(...)"
5,"Informative, true, and unbiased","This book gives an unbiased and informative view on the religion of islam, the koran, and about how islam is starting to erode and invade western society through false preeching, propoganda, and mass immigration to the west. The author disproves islam and the koran by showing how the koran contradicts itself countless times and compares it to the bible and other religions as well. The author creates an unbiased view by offering many documents and quotes from the koran, hadiths, and both islamic and western scholars. This book is easy to read and right to the point. Very informative on how islam was formed, how it spread, and its true meaning. For anyone that wants to sift through the lies and learn the truth. Best Buy!"
1,To people interested in reading more about Islam,"This book appears to be written with a polemic purpose. Please also read the following titles by two non-Muslim academics on the subject of Islam:1. John Esposito's ""Islam: The Straight Path""2. Bernard Lewis's ""Chritians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire: The Functioning of a Plural Society""Although not without their flaws, these two works attempt to give an account of the dimensions of Islam that may not be familiar to a western readership whose views about Islam have been informed mainly through the lens of the recent conflicts in the middle-east and through texts such as this one. ...If you are really an objective person, you ought also to hear what the Muslims have to say about their own religion, in addition to treatises on an ""Islamic Invasion"". It is a basic principle of fairness to never give a verdict before hearing both sides' arguments.Sincerely, A. Imam"
1,Very innacurate,"I am a Muslim, and I can personally answer the innacurate claims made by this book. If you use this book for your base to study Islam, you will have a distorted view, but in time, hopefully the truth will coem to you. Dont make yourself look like an idiot by using this to try to convert Muslims, you just look stupid"
1,Check the authors sources!,Please check the authors sources before you take his word. There are a number of qoutes taken out of context that give a distorted view of Islam. Old pagan Arab beliefs are not synonymous with Islam. I fear the only thing this book will accomplish is hate and fear of Islam. Christians I'm sure know that hatred is is not the true path.Try reading sources written by Muslims about Islam. Would you read a book about Christianity or Judaism written by a satan worshipper?
1,accute case of Islamophobia...,"Robert Morey seems to be suffering from an accute case of Islamophobia, this becomes clear from the very name Morey gave his book, ""Islamic Invasion"". If were to tell you that this book is a complete distortion of Islam, most likely you would assume that I am another Muslim trying to defend his faith, therefore, I would invite you to see the debate between Robert Morey and Jamal Badawi and you will be able to see for yourself just how credible Robert Morey is. I wish you the best in your journey for religious truth."
1,"Keep trying, but please do a better job","What a shame that our researchers are so pathetic in their critics of Islam; they pick up on inaccurate translations, and this coupled with their own obvious hatred of Islam and the actions of some Muslims inevitably results in an unsubstantiated attack on Islam. Ah well; were this author accurate in his views, the religion would be fast growing only in the East due to the birthrate and not so much in the West, where so many people are becoming Muslims, and quickly outnumbering every other religion. It's true that many of the followers have some problems that need to be sorted out, but Islam itself, including it's last prophet, can never really be affected or touched by sad books like this."
5,Addresses the crucial issue of divine revelation.,"Any time we wonder which religion is the true one, we must consider which one is divinely revelealed. In other words, which religion is based upon scripture which was given by God? Both the Bible and the Qu'ran claim to be from God. But, we cannot acknowledge them both, at least as they are known and understood by and large.Certainly it makes sense to take heed anytime God might be speaking to us. But, we must also discern when it is He indeed, and not a human or a fallen angel. This task faces everyone - Christian, Muslim, or neither. I have found Dr. Morey's book to be an enormous aid as I have grappled with this very important issue.ALSO RECOMMENDED:*Answering Islam* by Norman Geisler and Abdul Saleeb."
2,"Over-Simplified, with no real content","I first purchased Invasion, hoping to come to terms with a strong bias against Islam. What I wanted was a detailed description of customs and rites that might give me some insght into the Islamic mind. What I was presented with was an excrutiatingly poor outline that would appeal to the easiest of minds. Ever see ""A Clockwork Orange?"" I have just experienced it via a hasty, no holds barred propaganda pamphlet. You certainly don't have to care for Islam, but don't let fluff like this make up your mind."
3,IT'S THE TRUTH,"I HAVEN'T READ ALL OF IT YET--FIRST PART IS NOT VERY INTERESTING, BUT MAY GET BETTER--HOPE SO. I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO READ. BOOK WAS USED BUT IN GOOD SHAPE. NO COMPLAINTS. THANKS"
1,"May Allah guide you,you know nothing about Islam.","Islam is the world fastest growing religion,and it will be for many years to come,you just have to live with it,you like it or not.For those who say that Islam oppresses woman,please tell me why the majority of people who convert to islam are women??."
1,Outrageously stupid attempt to lower the dignity of Islam,"This is another silly and unnecessary attempt to belittling Islam, and Quran. The very title of the book shows a strange contradiction in authors view of Islam. He is starting by saying Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. That says it all, does not it!With all the shallow points he tried to make to prove Quran wrong and faulty, he could have also added that Quran fails to give the minimum intelligence required to those so called western scholars like him, so that they understand the original need of religion, as well as Islam."
3,Not everyone has the same handsize!,"This is a neat product, whoever thought of it did good!On the other hand...heh...no pun intended...BUTThis device is not made for small-handed people.My right hand (the one I'd be using for this) span is 8 inches (20.5 centimeters).I have a very hard time 1) wrestling with an unwilling, clawed, and fanged participant; 2)keeping the pill IN the tip while doing #1; and 3)properly injecting said pill into participant's throat while doing #'s 1 & 2.I would like to know if this pill-injector thingen comes in S, M, L, XL size??If so, I would like to order a SMALL, PULEEZE!!"
1,Not Worth the Money,"Avoid this series at all costs! It is too simplistic to actually help you design or conduct a survey. A better strategy would be to select a few volumes from the Sage Applied Social Research Methods Series. (See Lavarakas, Fowler, and Mangione volumes.) I have seen Undergraduate text books that do a better job explaining survey research methods.Given its price, the Survey Kit is a horrible waste of money. This is disappointing given the normally high quality of Sage products."
5,HAMMER OF THE GODS!,THIS SHIRT IS AWESOME... WAS SCARED THAT THE TIE DYE LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE CAMO.. BUT IT DOESNT AT ALL IN PERSON...
2,Unrealistic story,"The other reviewers described this story. While it deals with valid issues at an age appropriate level, the story is unrealistic, lacks an arc and a good ending and most importantly does not provide a clear understanding as to *why* and *how* Phil initially feels that he is prejudiced: why he initially thought that Daniel being black explains that he's a thief. Phil's character development feels more of an artificial, schoolbook example than a genuine, good story."
2,The Jacket,"I got this book because I've read most of Andrew Clements children chapter books. Most of the are 4 or 5 star worthy. This one wasn't. I finished the book in 17 minutes. It was very boring, yet some how it was kind of interesting.It is about a child that THINKS he is predujuce. Please excuse my spelling on that one word."
2,Only 'ok'!,"My ten year old son loved the two previous books he had read by the author, so I bought him this one. He told me that it was very short and lacked action. Being a mixed race boy he did identify with the situation, but was rather disappointed with the story."
3,The Jacket is a cool book,"it was a pretty good book. But, I think the story could have used some action in it.This review was provided by 10 year old my son."
3,A Review of The Jacket,"This was a book that I had to read for class. I will tell you about it.The characters are Phil,his parents,Mrs.Cormeir,Phil's brother Jimmy,Daniel,and Mrs. Atkin.This story is about a jacket that leads into a fight with Phil and Daniel.The chapters in the book were very easy to read because there's less than ten chapters,there's only six chapters.Phil sees his brother's jacket on a kid ,and this leads to a fight, Phil vs. Daniel. Phil learns things about himself and about his family.I didn't enjoy reading this book because it was kind of boring, but other people might like to read this book."
5,Jacket,"Good information and down to earth. My kids ages 12,10,8 love Clements books. Read all of them. Safe and good vocabulary."
5,The Jacket,Arrived in excellent condition. Great story for the children in my classroom to read. Content similar to what happens in many schools. Conflict and resolution.
4,My Best Book Report,"The story I am going to talk about is The Jacket. The genre of this book is Realistic Fiction. The setting is at school and at home. The problem is that Phil thought that Daniel stole his brothers jacket. Phil was white and daniel was black. Daniels grandma worked at Phil's house. At, Phil's street there weren't any black people and at Daniel Street there were not that many white. The theme is that Daniel had the jacket and Phil thought it was his brother's. I didn't like that Phil grabbed Daniel's collar and scream at him. I liked that Phil understood that he was wrong. This is what my story was about."
3,Underwhelming,"Phil sees a kid with his brother's jacket on and accuses the younger boy of stealing it. It turns out that Phil's mother gave it to her cleaning lady who gave it to her grandson (the kid).Phil then freaks out and thinks he thought the jacket was stolen because the kid was African-American (even though it was weird, because it was a fairly distinctive Italian jacket, so the race card seems a bit forced in this case).It deals with the issues well for the intended age range, but I wanted a little more character development-- for Clements, it left me a bit underwhelmed."
4,Textbook,"I needed this book for college, so I bought it used for about half the price annd it was practically brand new when I got it. I was surprised, I thought it would have markings and much more wear and tear but it was in great condition. I am very satisfied."
4,Excellent collection of this composer's works,"Ellen Taafe Zwilich deserves more recordings than she gets, although there are those who would argue that she has more than her share for a composer who hasn't, shall we say, passed on yet. The Louisville Orchestra is hard to beat in terms of sympathetic recordings of contemporary music, and the combination of Zwilich/Lousiville is well worth purchasing. Highly recommended."
3,South India,"I couldn't really tell if the device was working or not. I took it with me to South India. It did not seem to pack much punch, but it was better than having nothing."
1,Lentek,"this product did not work for me in south Vietnam. I have it turn on and mosquitoes still land on me and bit me. My friends noticed that I attracted more mosquitoes when I was wearing it, so they make me take it off after killing a mosquitoes on my forehead. Waste of $$ for me."
5,good for children's bedroom,"I have purchased Lentek Bite Shield because it is the only product I was able to find, that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents I am used to. I needed it for my daughter's bedroom so I couldn't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and I didn't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin. Lentek Bite Shild seems to work pretty well, she got bitten only once - the night I forgot to turn it on. Now I plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet. That way I would be sure that the batteries wouldn't die in the middle of the night."
1,Good Idea -- Wish It Worked,"A mosquito/bug repellent that's safe, nontoxic, easy to use, has an inoffensive odor, and covers enough area for a table or a hammock: I was sold. Unfortunately, this device doesn't seem to repel anything! I tested the Bite Shield in my garden on a warm afternoon. As the mosquitoes buzzed around my face and swarmed my bare arms and legs, I held the device a few inches in front of me and turned it on. I could hear the fan (very quiet) and smell the geraniol (not unpleasant), but the mosquitoes were absolutely unfazed. They continued to swarm, including in the immediate vicinity of the Bite Shield, and bit me numerous times -- even on the hand that was holding the device! The packaging states that geraniol is 400% more effective than citronella. Well, 400% times zero still equals zero. Very disappointing. I have returned the item, and will use my refund to buy some Calamine lotion."
1,Fake or Gimmick,"I bought three Lentek MM30C Bite Shield for myself and family. After a month of use, none of us saw a drop in mosquito bite. Maybe it was developed for a certain type of mosquito because over here in Westchester County, NY, we did not see any change."
5,"As Always, Mr. Smith's Book Delivers as Promised","Like other books and program's by Mr. Smith that I have purchased, The SWAT workout is an excellent book. Readers familiar with his other products may notice some similarities. This is because the basis of Mr. Smith's programs are tried and true body weight exercises and weight routines coupled with running. The progression is well thought out. The book promises to take an ""average citizen"" from police cadet to SWAT candidate and onto active duty SWAT member. Follow this program and you'll sure to be physically prepared."
5,Stew Smith is Awesome,"Stew Smith has honestly helped me get into the best shape of my life. And it keeps getting better. No bs, no gimmicks, just a practical yet challenging plan to achieve well-rounded fitness."
3,What Does the FBI Have on YOU?,"This is an odd little relic of the VHS age. Produced by 3-G Home Video in association with the International Creative Exchange, this 3-tape (or ""Dossier"") set has three or four generic segments it repeats tape-to-tape leaving little room for actual revelations in the remaining 25 minutes or so.Although I did learn about Hoover's strange obsession with stars like Elvis Presley, the main purpose of this needlessly large set seems to be to encourage the viewer to write to the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act and request their own FBI files. Since the purportedly included form is not in my set I can only assume that my late grandmother (the previous owner of this boon to the paranoid conservative) sent away for hers.If there is a VHS museum out there, this set definitely belongs there. Quite a curiosity."
3,"The ""Eroica"" as sleepathon","When two opinions differ as much as mine does from Mr. Richman's, it may not do any readers much good. But I must say that I don't hear the virtues that he does. This 1961 Eroica features Karajan's Berlin Phil. and barely precedes HvK's own outstanding Third. Bohm gets a smaller, less heroic sound from the orchestra, but it's clean and disciplined.However, the phrasing is stiff, and dynamics hover around mezzo forte for almost the entire first and second movements. Bohm's deliberate refusal to dramatize the score, combined with his deliberate tempi, caused my attention to wander quite early on. I found the funeral march devoid of anything like grief or grandeur, and the plodding trio of the Scherzo made me wonder if Bohm was deliberately turning it into a sleepathon. If anything, the 1958 Coriolan Over. is duller still. Enough. Let confusion reign. One man's great performance is another man's snooze."
2,Not adjustable,"The adjustable legs part advertised is quite misleading. Mine did not adjust. They are riveted and won't turn. Yeah, the legs will BEND, but that's about it."
2,TERRIBLE TECH SUPPORT,"If you have any problems with the unit, don't expect any help from their tech support. After spending more than an hour on hold, and nothing more than automated replies to emails, I'm fed up with Archos. I'm sending it back.Upon plugging into my PC (and others) via USB 2.0, the computers reboot. What's the point, if it can't communicate with the mother ship?Archos: Good try with the unit, but if you don't talk to your customers you'll eventually fail.Potential customers: 3 words: research, research, researchTake your money elsewhere. Im trying the Creative Zen"
3,ARCHOS MULTOMEDIA JUKEBOX,Great idea but sadly lacks battery power I have found mine discharges very quickly and does even hold the charge when not in use-- normally has discharged overnight .Would definately not last a full movie and approx 3 hours when playing MP3 files.The AVI files looks great on the small LCD but when displayed back thro a TV they show lots of blocks and the pictures have a purple cast.
5,MAcBook Pro companion,"After trying a few sleeves I found the perfect fit with this bag. Fits the MacBook pro like a glove and easily slides into my Belkin 17"" messenger."
5,Great CD,"This was Tiffany's first and most successful album. Although this album only contain's 10 songs, they really show off Tiffany's great vocal talent. There is not one song on this album that I don't like. Of course everybody loves the famous ""I Think We're Alone Now"" and ""Could've Been"" but the rest of the songs are just as great. When I heard this album again, it reminded me of what a great, powerful voice Tiffany has. I love Tiffany and any true fan must have this album."
