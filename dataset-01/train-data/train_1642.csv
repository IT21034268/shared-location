3,definitely a mixed bag,"Those with even basic experience in web design can skip the first few chapters of the book-- however, after that the authors clearly outline how to easily create ASP pages. I would only recommend this book to a beginner. The CD is not useful-- it includes trial versions of drumbeat (would it not be a reasonable assumption that owners of this book have Drumbeat? )"
2,Sloppy Editing Makes this a Real Bummer,"This book is on par with many in the Dummie library. Too many times authors will rush to fill a need and forget the parameters of accurate reporting and authorship. I will not recommend this book to anyone unless you are prepared for a mountain of frustration especially when using the CD.Since Macromedia bought Elemental Software, the creators of Drumbeat, I have been monitoring the Drumbeat forums. It seems that Macromedia has their hands full in supporting this product. There is no doubt that Drumbeat can be a killer application once the bugs are worked out and the product matures. ASP can be a complicated scripting language for which Drumbeat was meant to assist Web developers over the hurdles. The community is crying out for a first class book written on Drumbeat. You will not find it here."
3,"Its Ok, could definitely be better","This book is not written well IMO. When they talk about technical things the explanations are somewhat technical. Whenever they do get down to earth, its just useless commentary. I much prefer the way ASP for dummies was written. Very simply, very clearly. But the book does contain some helpful info and is an okay introduction to Drumbeat. I'm really looking forward to a better book (Teach yourself Drumbeat in 21 days)."
4,Not much new here but...,"MacroMedia's tech support has been less than enthusiastic and the eStore Drumbeat manuals are littered with costly typos. Given that, although this book does not cover the eStore version, it is still somewhat useful to have. It's typical Dummies series stuff--so you can skip the first 1/3 of it, it's way too basic. The rest is just rewording of the product manual but I still gleaned a few new tricks from it.If your learning curve for this software has been lengthy, you may want to check it out. Otherwise, save your money and reread the manual."
3,"Beggars cannot B choosers,albeit better than bread N water.","For the only book out there in the market for this software, it could be alot worse. Have I learned from it, the answer is yes. Although half way through the book as I write this, I do have some bones to pick. 1)WHY USE EXAMPLES IN THE BOOK THAT DOESN'T COME WITH THE ENCLOSED CD? 2)THE CD IS FAULTY, IT DOES NOT LOAD THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU DO SUPPLY. 3)ASIDE FROM THE TRADEMARK OF THE BOOK, DUMMY-SPEAK...PERHAPS DUMMY WRITE..their use of English, coupled with poor communication can sometimes promote obfuscation. An example or a metaphor of the above.Instead of saying: TURN OFF THE TELEVISION.They would say at times: The glare on the television, not like your Grandma's - your father's side, is turned off by the button from the top.A little exaggeration, but read it and you'll know what I mean.All in all, you will learn something from this book. Just wished it was just a notch higher in grade. But for what it has to offer, it will do.God Bless!"
2,You probably won't 'know' Drumbeat when you're done,"My main complaint about this 'how to' book is that they never give suggestions in area's where things can go wrong. The instructions are ok, but if it doesn't work, you're out of luck. No suggestions regarding common things that can go wrong and how to fix them. Can be very frustrating following the directions over and over and not getting the correct result until you figure out something that isn't in the book!"
3,"The book is OK, BUT the example on CD doesn't work..","At least they should try to install if their example is working or not.The book content is ok (like any other dummy book)I really dissapoint that the CD doesn't work.If I am wrong about the CD, somebody please enlighten me...."
3,Dumb Book!,"I thought the Manual that came with the program was more helpfull than the Dummies book, and easier to follow, which is not usually the case. Not bad to have as a backup though."
3,its ok,its ok movie i do like andrew macarthy he was good this movie well i do like to say just rent dont buy it.
4,There's nowhere like om.,"Although this Om is made of plastic, not real metal, it's a beautiful piece of jewelry for one's car, it sends a great signal out into the world, and it is a welcome reminder of peace and mindfulness when driving."
4,Great looking!,"This is a beautiful plastic emblem (I wish it were metal) that looked great on my Highlander up until this winter, when the paint completely faded suddenly. I bought this last year and have enjoyed it a lot. It is too bad is not a very durable product, but the price is very affordable."
4,I agree with the assessment that it is for beginners...,"...because I am one! I have never been that interested in makeup but realize there will come a time when I may need to know how to apply it. I don't really buy the fashion and makeup magazines either, so a book that clearly writes *and* illustrates how to apply makeup is exactly what I need.Other beauty books which are probably intended for the more experienced have written descriptions of the application process or only a picture or two of the finished product; but not this book. Spiral bound, the pages fold out and show the step by step process. As noted in the other review, it is fairly up to date as well, discussing shimmer and other relatively more recent makeup styles.For those who are curious to actually SEE the book itself, it can be usually found on display at The Body Shop for people to flip through."
2,Not for me,If you are familiar with putting on makeup you don't need this book at all. Very Basic. I would recommend to those who are completely in the dark about applying makeup.
3,It is good for people who know about clasic make up.,I was looking for a great book that show me step by step how can I make my own fantastic look for my bellydancers and for me. This did not help me a lot for that purpose. That book is better to make my own clasic look maybe for special ocasions but not to create a fantastic look for me to bellydance shows.
3,Left me wanting more,"Although this book gives great pictures and has great fold out pages giving you more in depth step by step instructions, it left me wanting more. I felt like it was a lot of the same kind of applications just switching up the colors. If youre looking for a book that will give you some insight on different color combos this might be a decent book. I would definately recommend this for beginners but for myself, as a licensed professional, I found it kinda bland."
3,It does the job,This book is about the only history of blood chits available. It is pretty incomplete in a number of areas because this is such a narrow area of investigation and history.
3,Timothy Cubes,"I have a finicky bunny, he's not a chewer, doesn't enjoy toys or even hay all that much. I bought these to give them a try. They are good quality and would be great if he would eat them. He doesn't, I don't blame the product, I blame the rabbit. lol ;)! So overall, not a huge hit in this house, but they may be elsewhere!"
1,Picture shows different product.,"I ordered the cubes thinking the Alfalfa cubes would be shipped to me. I received the Timothy Cubes, which are different than the picture. The Timothy Cubes were harder than a brick. I would never give my 6 year old guinea pig old something old and stale. I threw them in the trash, and Amazon refunded my purchase."
1,Bad quality hay,My bunny had a hard time eating this because the hay was so dry and it was too small for her to chew on.
5,Chinchillas love this too!,"I give these to my chinchillas as a healthy chew block in addition to regular batches or loose timothy hay. Although not all of them care for it, the ones that do really enjoy the cubes.Usually it takes a month or two to go through a pack of cubes, so I don't constantly run out of these like I do with some of the other easier to chew toys that they demolish within a day or two. I recommend trying these with your chinchilla or other small critters who enjoy timothy hay.Now, if only Kaytee also sold their alfalfa cubes on Amazon..."
2,"Nice figure, bad packaging.","Overall the actual figure is very nice but the one I was sent by seller was beat up and something I wouldn't call ""new"". Card was bent and not what I thought I was buying. Bought other items from seller, I hope they aren't in this condition. Won't buy from seller again."
2,"Great adventure, weak writing","This book is promoted as ""an examination of...what to do with the second half of life."" While the accomplishment of completing this daunting ride in her late 40's is admirable, the author includes only a few paragraphs about her thoughts for the future. It is a rather dry account of the trip. Being an author is definitely not what Eloise Hanner should consider for her next career."
1,Shallow and Empty,"As an avid bike rider who has undertaken a similar journey I kept expecting the writer would have some sort of ""epiphany"" for her lifes purpose. Instead I found the writer empty and shallow, and her accounts ""whiney"" at times. The author is definately in search of an identity as her career choices would display, Peace Corp vs. Stock Trader, but never finds one. There are hardships she faced, but instead of becoming a stronger individual, she learns how much easier it is to lean on the resources of others. Isn't that what a leech does?"
5,A Great True Story,"Ms. Hanner has written a great story about her bicycle trip across the country.in seven weeks. At the age of 48 she was a business woman who had never done serious cycling. A superb description of her months of trainng, getting the right bike and equipment, including sleeping bag and tent and a thousand items required for the trip. Her battles with weather from the cold and snow of the Rocky Mountains to the heat and humidity of the Midwestern states. This book is an inspiration to ordinary people with a yen to do the impossible. Difficult to put down."
4,a good military manual,I don't think this manual should be used by criminals it should be used aginst a foregion army.It shows how to recruit soilders and propganda technices.A good militiary manual but there are better ones on the market.
4,Book by Bruce Boxleitner,I was surprised to find that Bruce Boxleitner had written two books and was curious as to the content. Have also ordered his original book.
4,"A fun, motivational read.","Jean's story fills the first 100 pages. She's a REAL compulsive overeater and I totally identified. Many of her stories are fun, too... she's a real ""people person."" The next 80 pages tell of the birth and growth of Weight Watchers. Then a couple chapters describe the original W.W. guidelines (which are rigid and focused on animal products compared to 2003 W.W. guidelines). The last several chapters (and inserted throughout) contain oodles of stories of individuals who lost and maintained through W.W., some with 200 + pounds. I found it a fun, motivational, and easy read."
1,so-so,"I had to keep adjusting the volume quite often. Perhaps if I had been in a quiet auditorium, it would have been different, but I was in a small car."
1,Rusting is a problem.,My knives started to rust after 3wks of use. I didn't put them in the dishwasher either. I just leave them in the sink w/the dirty dishes till I'm ready to wash. But that shouldn't be the problem. I have a cheap $3 butcher's knife from chinatown that hasn't rusted yet and I treat that one the same.
2,"Good steak knives, others are useless","This is the dullest knife set I have ever own. I had to sharpen them as soon as I pulled them out of the box! And I still can't get the butcher knife to cut anything but butter. The paring knife is a complete joke. It's a serious hazard to have these around because they don't cut through anything.With this being said however, the serrated knives (steak knives and bread knife) are awesome.The knives appear to be good, solid quality, but just aren't sharp enough. If you have the money, spend it on something you can really use like Wusthof."
3,"Pretty good, but declined in quality","These knives have declined in quality: in 2002, they were firmly in the middle of Consumer Reports' knife review and named a Best Buy, but in 2005, they were at the very bottom and their cutting performance rating decreased. In my experience, the chef's knife's handle is comfortable even on hard vegetables, but it is not as sharp as my stamped Henckels. After 11 months of use, the blade has not dulled much and is unstained, but it has developed a 2-3 mm long nick at the base. By contrast, the blade of my 8 year old stamped Henckels has no visible imperfections.Chicago Cutlery Metropolitan was named a best buy in both 2002 and 2005."
5,I got this set about 6 months ago from amazon friday sale,It is a great set and I haven't had any rust problems as some earlier comments. Maybe its b/c I don't put them into the DishWasher... Definetely a good buy. I bought two sets for future gifts...
5,Great Starter/Mid-Range Set,"I bought these knives about 15 months ago and have loved having them. I'll agree with other reviewers that the steak knives are only so-so, but I basically saw them as a throw in on this set. They are a great set for any new college grad that is starting out and looking for an affordable set. I cook all the time and the knives have been perfect for everything."
5,Great for the price!,"I was really surprised by the quality of this Farberware set. The knives are heavy, well balanced and sharp. I have used these knives for over a year now and, for the price, they are great. I haven't noticed any rust spots on any of the knives yet, but this may be due to my dutiful hand washing + immediate drying after usage -- a routine you should also follow. Like all cutlery, they will need to be ""sharpened"" with the include steel after a few uses. I am going to purchase a few more as xmas gifts!"
3,apples and oranges,"These are good knives for the money. Yes, I know they are not Henckels...But A Henckel 8"" chef knife cost $80 compaired to the cost of the Faberware forged pro knife is $20. I feel this is a good value for someone who is on a budget. The key to any knife is to keep it sharp, use the steel and have it professionally sharpened."
3,Don't get if you plan to install Windows XP,"This is supposed to be a good computer for a good price. But if your plan is to install windows xp on it. Forget about it. Toshiba until now does not have the drivers for this computer for windows xp! If you think it is not important to have wi-fi, the Fn keys working but able to use WinXP... go for it!"
1,Heavy and no battery life,"The battery barely lasts 2 hrs. And the computer feels so much heavier than I thought it would be. I pretty much have to use it as a desktop, instead of a laptop, with it plugged into the wall all the time. Not very portable."
1,I Expected A Longer Healthier Lifespan,"I ordered this March of 2007. By March of the following year I was already having problems with it. I spent over 1300 dollars on it and it was trash after two years. The screen, the fan, the stability of the HD - I've had continual issues with all of that. And, I don't play video or online games, or work with media. I use it for reading on the internet, writing, and watching DVD's."
1,Poorly Written and Researched,"Not sure where the good rating came from, but this book is poorly written and seems to not have been researched much, if at all. Limited test cases show that material was probably grabbed from some other publication, with little application to the application at hand. It is now a table leveller in the office."
3,Good suggestions but ... sexist... !,"Noticed this book, as it is a recently-published book on database design. Not as detailed and researched as one of the typical O'Reilly publisher books, but nonetheless, still pretty interesting in the reccomendations and suggestions the author had to say.Was somewhat perplexed by the sexist remarks on page 19, however. The author described what an ""Educated Idiot"" is, someone with a PhD and that is given a role in database design, but has ""no real-world experience"", and ""lacks necessary technical skills"". In addressing such a person, the author uses the word ""she"" multiple times, as if this person must be a woman. There is a reference again on the next page too... Amusing..."
2,Don't write bogus reviews,"I'm frustrated with the labs. Like the previous legit review said, these books are setup in a way that forces you to attend the classes. As for all the bogus 5 star reviews and their thousands of other reviews, thanks for selling me a lemon."
4,Pretty good reference,"There is a lot of material in these books, and they do a pretty good job at test preparation. They're not perfect however. If you don't plan on actually doing every ""Lession"" step by step, you probably won't learn everything you need. Personally, it wasn't my favorite way to learn the material. I'm hoping the ExamCram2 series does a better job of it, they always have in the past."
1,"Waste of money, waste of time...","This book was a big diappointment considering it was published by Microsoft Press. I highly doubt Craig Zacker would have the capacity, knowledge, expertise or experience necessary for passing the 70-293 exam after reading this book. I read the book twice prior to the exam, which did absolutely nothing to assist me. Shame on Microsoft Press for allowing this book to be published without verifying alignment of information with their exam!!!"
5,good book,working with this book now learning networking good book comes with cd also that's a great help also the cd to learn.
2,Dont' waste your time or money,"I am an MCT/MCSE/MCBDA and have read scores of technical books.Don't let the fact that it's Microsoft Press fool you.These books are shallow and do not offer the depth of information needed to pass these exams. There is no continuity between the books either. I read someone's comment posted below that said they had trouble with some of the technologies because the technologies are new to them. That is not the case; the fact is you are having trouble with the concepts because these books are horrible.Craig Zacker - The author of two of these books is not even an MCP! This guy couldn't pass these exams if his life depended on it.To sum up these books are shallow, plagued with inaccuracies, and have horrible explanations of many important concepts.With these books you probably won't pass the exams, and you certainly won't be able to perform the job function of a systems engineer."
2,"A good start, but earning MCSE will take a lot more study.","I read every page of these books, the readiness review sections and all 430 practice questions. I felt very confident going in to the first test that I had a mastery of the concepts taught in the books. Problem is...the exam covers many topics which are not covered by these books. I cannot recall the exam verbatim but do remember the test included questions on subnetting, compostion of .vbs scripts, and webdav, NONE of which are covered in these books.What the books do teach they teach in an easily comprehendable way. They do a good job of reinforcing the concepts they teach through the included readiness review section and practice questions on CD."
2,Software,The only good thing about Microsoft Press is the trial software provided. It gives you the opportunity to get some hands on practice on your home computer.
2,MS Press don't want you pass at all,"Like all the other books from MS Press, they do their best to let you fail the exam. The topic covered in the book usually not well balanced or deep enough to gain knowledge.Buy some publishedr book which is well target for certificate exam."
2,Have read better,I have used microsoft training kit books before and this one has to be so basic it doesn't really help you comprehend the material - still rely on 70-291 book for indepth information
2,Very briefly,"They just can't call it self-preparement guides - maybe exam-review or something like that. I saw many self-prep guides, these are the worst. For example, 70-290 is ~350 pages long. Book is split onto two parts. Only half of the book has been dedicated to well structured but very brief concepts. Another half is just hardcopy of the same questions that included in the CD. This is what I cant understand. Seems like somebody was so lazy that day and just wanted to puff up the book's size, fill it with something. Although test quesions is ok and there are some nice case studies, the overall picture is poor.The test if pretty hard and you'll never pass it only with this book - you'll have to buy something additional or spend time and tons of paper finding and printing appropriate topics from help and Technet - keep it in mind when buying these books."
4,about Blood of the Dragonl,I bought this dvd's a few month ago They sent me Blood of the Dragon ofJimmy Wang Yu and I wanted Blood of The Dragon Peril by Jerry Chan withthe japanes Officer samourai who tried to end a masked man in the towncommiting many attack I watched that movie 20 years ago in VHS tapea very good movie now they confused people with Blood of the dragon who is not the Original one please tell the difference between the two movies
2,Jimmy Wang Yu,"This is not the movie I thought it was. This movie isBlood of the Dragon, not Blood of the Dragon Peril. I bought this at my local used store and the Saturn DVD says it stars Godfrey Ho actors like Phillip Cheung and Marty Chui. I know Blood of the Dragon PERIL is probably bad, but I didn't want to see this Wang Yu movie that I already have 2 different versions of, including this crappy full screen version. Not a bad movie, but not the right one."
2,"OK, but not as advertised.","I selected this particular item because the description said ""all brass."" I live in Hawaii where everything steel rusts very quickly, especially in a shower! I was a bit disappointed to discover these rings were in fact made of steel. The roller balls were brass, but the rings themselves were steel. They'll do for a while, and at least the rust won't show right away since they are a dark color. In all fairness, I did tell the seller about this and was told that these were some sort of temporary stock and that she did not know that they were shipping steel rings advertised as being brass."
5,One of the best books about math that I have read.,"Clawson writes with refreshing enthusiasm and really conveys how much fun it can be to explore the nature of mathematics. Although there are many equations in the book, Clawson uses them not only to help the readers understand the mathematical ideas, but also to show how truly great mathematicians can come up with extremely elegant expressions to describe what at first would seem to be completely unmanageable concepts."
5,Superb book by a highly intuitive author,"This book is superbly written by a highly intuitive author. The author knows how to connect to his intended readers. Book is highly informative and the equations are well defined and explained. Once you read a few pages, you are hooked. I just hope that Mr. Calvin C. Clawson will write more books on Mathematics, he will be doing a great service to would-be-mathematicians like me. More power to you sir!"
2,Not up to the standards of the original,"While the original film was great and is one of my all-time favcorites, this sequel in no way comes up to the same standards of humor or storyline. In fact, it comes off as a blatant attempt to squeeze a few more dollars off of the original films followers. You don't need to believe me. Try renting it before you put down hard-earned cash on this wannabe..."
2,far from the original,major league 2 had some funny moments but it is far from the classic of the first one
3,basically Major League,this movie is almost exactly the same as the first with some subtle differences it is funny though
4,The hard luck Indians are back for another season,"While this isn't the instant classic that the first MAJOR LEAGUE movie was, I actually like the sequel as well as the original.The only thing really missing from the first film is Wesley Snipes as center fielder Willie Mays Hayes, but Omar Epps does a nice job in his place.So what if you know that they're going to pull if off from the outset...it's all about the journey right?Bob Uecker makes the film!"
3,good to the last drop,"always somewhat skeptical when it comes to sequels. major league 2 right on target. answers some questions from number one and makes you keep laughing. good, good, good"
5,Pretty good,"Pretty good sequel. I like the returners.Rick Vaughn(Charlie Sheen) tries to clean up his act but his speed gets slower and he gets in a slump.Jake Taylor(Tom Berenger) becomes a coach who helps rookie catcher Rube Baker with his problems throwing the ball back to the catcher.Willie Mayes Hayes(Omar Epps) hits long balls and keeps saying his leg hurts.Pedro Cerrano(Dennis Haysbert) stops practicing voo-doo and keeps hitting pop flies.Roger Dorn(Corbin Bernsen) buys the team, has to sell it back to Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton), then activates himself and is benched the entire season.Lou Brown (James Gammon) is back to manage the Indians and then gets cancer.Now the new Faces:Jack Parkman (David Keith) is a slugger catcher who is arrogant and hates his teammates, later he gets traded to the Chicago White Sox.Komakazi Tanaka(Takaaki Ishibashi) comes from Japn in the Jack Parkman trade.Rube Baker(Eric Bruskotter) is a rookie catcher who can't throw the ball back to the pitcher."
2,"It's just like the first one, only without the humor.","The first Major League is one of my favorite movies, but I can barely sit through this bastardized sequel. Ueker is still funny, but the rest is just a weak rehash of the origional. No wonder Snipes didn't return to play Willie Mays Hayes. I shudder to think what Major League 3 is like."
3,had to have it,"If it weren't Major League, I wouldn't have gotten it.I love baseball, and ""Major League"" is definitely one of the best baseball movies ever. I watch this movie infrequently, but I needed to have it in my collection (as well as ""Major League III"" which is not even as good as this).If this were not the ""Major League"" franchise, it would have gotten 2 stars."
4,Major League II,"If you like baseball, you'll like this one, especially if you liked the original Major League."
5,Major League 2,"It was a pretty good movie and I enjoyed seeing it again, but why were they playing in Baltimore's Camden Yards? Cleveland Municipal was still open, but Jacobs' Field wasn't opened until 1994."
5,Simply Amazing,"Without getting overly analytical, this music is a MUST HAVE for any romantic vocal fan. If you've ever performed these, it is what would be called a ""masterpiece"". You will get something the further you dig into the music. Easily performed if mediocrity is acceptable. If true art is the aim, almost immpossible. And an artistic performance by one of the best choirs in this century. Very recommended."
4,Excellent Christian study guide,"Excellent, easy to use study guide for Lord of the Flies. Good thought provoking questions with lots of optional project and writing ideas. My only complaint would be that the ""work-book"" sections ran together instead of starting on a fresh page. This made it difficult to assign a particular section. Overall, though, a great help!"
3,It's OK at best,"I read this one in less then an hour. It's basically a lot of fluff and no substance for parenting advice with your daughter. It's good enough for a coffee table book in my opinion, but not a resource by any means."
4,Good book!,"Very nice book, very touching. It makes you aware of what we should be doing as fathers. Not much to read or much direct advise, but it did make me think, as far as how am I doing as a father? Overall good book."
2,Makes a good greating card,"This reads like a nice greeting card but if you are looking for some insight on father/daughter relationships don't buy this ""book"". Each page contains only a sentence or two and a nice photo. This would make an excellent gift to the new father so I guess it has some value."
2,Cover is messed up,"When I received my book I was ecstatic! HOWEVER, either the packaging that they had it in didn't protect it well enough or the messed it up before they shipped it because the front cover has a ton of scratches on it and it has some sort of sticky black substance on it! :/ The edges of the book are all scrunched up too. Really disappointed at the quality of the cover. If I had known this was the condition I was going to receive this book in, I would have bought it elsewhere."
4,This is not Copland at his best,"Aaron Copland is without a doubt my favorite composer of all time. I have collected many CDs of his work over the years, and have therefor have many recordings of all his most famous works. With that knowledge, I have to say that this is not the best recording on the market.The sparkle and jazz of Copland's style is missing from this CD. The orchestra doesn't show off the playful side of Copland's work, which is what I think sets Copland apart from every one else. That is why I don't feel that is the best Copland CD availiable today"
3,"Episodic, but not without intermittent rewards","Lopez-Cobos and his Cincinnati forces are a musical treasure. However, I was very disappointed in this release. The violins don't sound all that great--steely tone that one does not usually associate with Cincinnati, and L-C fails to build a satisfying succession of climaxes ."
5,Simply Unbelievable.,Definately the most comprehensive and most useful tutorial material I have ever seen. Any avid 3D Studio Maxer should get this now! I never realised how much be my lighting effects could get until I watched this video! It's a Bible!
3,from a former Lisa Lowe student,"Personally, I feel that Professor Lowe is very insightful about theory, the Asian American experience, colonialism, identity politics, cultural criticism. etc. I learned a lot from her as a student and after reading this book, I continue to learn from her. I think Immigrant Acts deserves a 5 star rating for academic merit.BUT, it has been 5 years since I taken one of her courses and I have forgotten how jargon filled her language can be. After being away from academia, reading this book was a daunting task. As much as I respect this text, I feel that it is unfortunate that Professor Lowe cannot relate to a general audience. She is definitely (intentionally or unintentionally) catering to fellow scholars. She has a lot to say and offer her reading public. Its too bad that most people can not understand her. I give only one star for writing style and being reader friendly. Sorry, Professor Lowe."
3,Works well.,"Supposed to be 8 rolls - only received one roll. Customer service reimbursed me immediately though. Also, this 'tape' is a dry roll - you need to apply water to the adhesive side to turn it into tape. Can be a tad inconvenient. To be fair, though, it works well and looks professional once done."
3,Wildly Uneven,"As a fan of the wildly uneven releases by his former group The Boo Radleys, I didn't hold out much hope for Martin Carr's solo work, released under the aegis of Brave Captain. Indeed, as always, Carr's work on Go With Yourself veers from the successfully inventive psychedelic ballads ""Tell Her That You Want Her"" and ""Hermit Versus the World"" to a minor failure like the opening cut ""The Monk Jumps Over the Wall"". Even when the songs don't cohere, which is often, there's a hint of the bristling experimentalism of late period Talk Talk and the denser escapades of his former band. Yet for all my reservations, I thrill to Carr's overreaching, which reminds me more than a little bit of David Bowie circa The Man Who Sold the World. Is Brave Captain's Hunky Dory coming next? One hopes and wonders."
3,Rubbermaid Counter Top Dish Drain Rack,"I agree with the other reviewers, they don't make them with a thick gauge like they used to, and the coating appears to be thin. This is not an heirloom dishrack :) but it doesn't need to be. Hard to find bisque color, glad Amazon had a few."
2,not the old rubbermaid quality,"The drainer as well as the tray were in my opinion not even close to the old version of the rubbermaid products. It seems thin, hard, not flexible and I can imagine it not lasting very long"
4,Rubbermaid 6032-01-BISQU,"Just to add to what others have written. The utensil holder on the one I received is different than shown in the images. The one I have is more rectangular and while it is securely attached, it is quite small and certainly can't hold large cooking utensils. The other thing I wanted to comment on is the cup/glass holders along the side. When I put a cup on them, it slides all the way to the bottom. I don't know if that's normal or not (or if they are really cup holders or not) just that on previous ones that I owned they would hold the cups up off the bottom nicely leaving room for other items. Anyway, just by two cents."
1,"vinyl splits, cups fall out front and back","This looks good when new. After a couple of years, several rows of vinyl started to split and rust developed on the bottom left. This is the opposite end where we put the long knives - ironically this side is still good. There are wide gaps in front and back where cups and small items will fall through. You will learn where to put them when the first one falls over and breaks. I just put some tie wraps horizontally across. Not too pretty, but works. I'll go back to the polypropylene drainer."
2,"cheaply made, a disappointment","My last Rubbermaid dish drainer was well made and lasted thru years of use. Those days are gone, now they're made in China. The metal used is much lighter gauge which makes for a flimsy product. My drainer arrived dirty, it looked in used condition. The silverware basket (which did not match the drainer) was attached with clear tape. Under the tape was a lot of dirt and a short black hair..yuk! I still haven't found a sturdy replacement drainer. I know it won't be a Rubbermaid product!"
5,All around fabulous,"Kudos! Great book, especially for the occasional baker. I love love love the lemon ginger gems (soft, you add crystallized ginger 1 package 3-ounce cream cheese, lemon zest to sugar dough). I like more innovative cookeis like that and the coffee toffee bars and pretty much all of the cheesecake creations throughout the book. The rest of the gang in my house can't get enough of some of the simpler ideas (my husband can vouch for the fluffer nutter choc chip cookie sandwiches: peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwiched between chocolate chip cookies--so easy and so YUMMY!) and the big cookies you can make and decorate like a pizza--big kid favorite.Hope there's a follow-up book, becasue I'll get it."
5,Works with iMovie 4.0 / TiVo,"I purchased this little box, the size of a medium sized book, recently and have had a very smooth experience with it. I wanted to import a TV show (Jeopardy!) on which I appeared, so I researched various hardware solutions (almost bought the Formac offering) and decided that this box was the best regarded. I connected my TiVo to the box using the s-Video and RCA audio connectors, and I connected the Canopus to my Powerbook G4 12"" via the Firewire connection. iMovie 4 saw the connection immediately and I was importing video seconds later; making clips for each of the 4 sections of the show.Then it was a simple matter to edit my clips together, add some still frames and titles and export to iDVD 4.0.1 with which I burnt a very nice DVD. People actually complimented the quality of the video, which of course was limited by it's NTSC original source, but at least it was a accurate replica of the original with no dropped frames or loss of audio sync."
5,The best converter on the planet - 4VideoEquipment.com,"This device is ideal for all OHCI and DV-only capture cards for Macintosh or PC. The ADVC-100 Is the best converter out there, you won't find anything more compatiable with your system than this device. It may be a little more out of your pocket to purchase this converter, but it's well worth it because there is no known limitation. For example, the DAC-100 currently cannot be used with a external firewire drive, but the ADVC-100 can, so i'd recommend it if you have a external firewire drive. Also, i'd recommend the ADVC-100 over a competitor if your using it on a MAC. Currently the DAC-100 and others do not work with iMovie 3. The Canopus ADVC-100 has been shown to work fine in iMovie 3 workspace."
3,This is not an Mpeg2 encoder,Some may be mislead. This device captures analog data in DV format. You will need a lengthy conversion to MPEG2 to burn to DVD.
3,bible cover,"The cover was ok, but it had a terrible smell to it. I smelled like it had been stored in a barn for along time."
1,Embassy Alligator Embossed Burgundy Genuine Leather Bible Cover,Ths product arrived with a defective zipper and I was not able to use it at all. Something made in USA would likely be much better.
1,"Looks like Plastic, looks cheap","I was really looking forward to receiving this for my new study Bible, but was so very disappointed when it arrived. The ""genuine leather"" is a cheap plastic shiny faux-alligator. It looks brown, not burgundy, but that is not the problem. It's the cheap materials it is made of. The stitching is fine, the main zipper works, the zipper compartment and front pouch are a good size and design for pens, markers, keys, and papers. The ""leather look"" trim is downright embarassing...the kind used on cheap Chinese-made toys sold at dollar stores.This one is by ""Embassy"" and it's too much trouble to mail back, but I won't give them as gifts. The reason I was so surprised at how cheesey they are is because I carefully read the reviews by buyers who had purchased this Bible cover! If you want a cheap plastic Bible cover, this will do, but if you want a ""Genuine Leather"" quality cover to last many years, spend more and don't get one by Embassy."
2,Poor Leather Quality. Avoid this one.,"The product looks nice (color, shape, and design) but the quality of the leather, advertised as Genuine, does not feel good when touched and appears to be a cheap, low quality leather."
2,"Good value for the price, but color of trim not as pictured....","This was definitely a good price for this item, but the color of the trim in the photo on Amazon was the same color as the book cover itself. The color of the trim on the item I received was black, in sharp contrast to the burgundy/brown color of the book cover. This emphasizes that the material the trim is made of is actually a different material than the rest of the book cover, in a bad way, looks like flat plastic/vinyl, as opposed to the leather/croc look of the rest of it. I would not have purchased this had I known this, but it's not worth returning.In terms of quality of it otherwise, it's large enough to hold a large book/bible, and also supple enough to bend easily. The pockets are roomy enough to hold a small journal, pens, etc. It seems sturdy enough as well to handle a larger book."
5,Leather Bible Cover,"Love this Bible cover. It's very handy to use since it has a carrying strap and on rainy days, it keeps my Bible dry."
5,Leather Bible Cover,The Bible Cover is beautiful and will be given as a gift for Christmas. It was received in a most timely manner and in excellent new condition. Thank you for the fine service!
5,Perfect,I use this one for my study bible and it suits it perfectly looks good and serves it purpose perfectly it has a rich burgundy colouring and it's soft leather I highly recommend getting this if you want quality
1,HORRIBLE BIBLE COVER -,"DO NOT BUY THIS COVER, ITS MOLDY IN SMELL AND IT PEELS OF THE LEATHER PART. THE SMELL MADE US SICK"
1,LEATHER COVER FOR BIBLE STUNK,LEATHER COVER FOR MY BIBLE STUNK SOOOO MUCH LIKE SMOKE i HAD TO THROW IT AWAY. THANKS FOR NOTHING.
5,Bible Cover,"Very nice, great value for the money. Very easy to use and looks nice. I would purchase one again if needed."
3,OK,Go this product home and was a little disappointed. It was a beautiful color but did not fit my bible the way I thought it would. Did not keep it's shape. Great price though. I actually gave it to a friend. I would still buy it again but for a thicker bible.
1,Do NOT buy!,I literally had to put this bible cover outside because of the horrible smell of the leather. I will never be able to use it. My house even smelled with the few minutes that I had the cover in my house. I would not even give it a one star rating.
3,not a winner,"the price was great, but the product was not what i hoped for. you get what you pay for sometimes. quality very poor."
1,Embassy Alligator Embossed burgundy Genuine Leather Bible Cover,"I was very disappointed when I received the bible cover. The cover had a musty smell to it. The stitching was coming apart at one of the seams. I sewed the seam and is trying to air out the smell. I did not want to sent the item back, because the price was so cheap. I have not decided if I want to keep the cover or donate it."
1,THE COLOR IS NOT BURGANDY ITS BROWN AND NOT GLOSSY BUT MUTE/FLAT,I DONT FEEL LIKE GOING THROUGH THE HASSLE OF SENDING IT BACK. ITS NOT QUALITY. IF THAT DOESNT BOTHER YOU GO FOR THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OF THE NEW COVERS OF THIS MODEL 8.55 THATS WHAT ITS WORTH OF LESS EXPECT BROWN THAT PICTURE IS MISLEADING AND DO NOT EXPECT GLOSSY. ITS FLAT GET YOUR OIL OUT.
1,Embassy Alligator Bible Cover,Smelled very strong paint smell and was not at all the quality I was expecting. I don't even believe it was real leather. Just very disappointed in the quality.
2,Extremely Strong Odor,"I ordered this Bible case from ebay (same Embassy brand). I expected it to be on the cheap side, for the price (I only paid $5.95), and was prepared for that. I had also read reviews about the odor, but I figured things usually air out. BUT...when it arrived in the mail and my son brought it up to me, when he walked in the room, the musty odor was very strong, and I hadn't even opened the package yet! It was a little too thin and small for my Bible, but I would have kept it accept for the smell. I put my Bible in it for less than a minute, and it now smells..a day later! I had to go straight to the post office and return it, since our house smelled musty with it in it. It is not a leather smell...it is a strong musty odor. The color is very shiny plastic looking red/burgundy, which makes all of the trim look brown. Not a big deal..It also has two sleeves inside the case for papers (not mentioned in the description). It would have served its function except for the odor."
5,Great Bible Cover,"Have owned this bible cover for over two years and it has shown wear in any form. Its so easy, roomy and just the perfect size. It has two nice zippered areas, and plenty of room for my bible and papers, pens, car keys, etc. Would not leave home without it. The color goes with most of my outfits too, but most of all it keeps my bible safe and sound from rain, snow and bright sunshine.Would recommend it highly for a nice birthday or special gift for family or friends."
2,Bible Cover,"While the cover is nice and I would have liked it, I purchased a Large Print Life Application NIV Bible which is much larger than the cover. The cover came up as a suggestion to go with the Bible. I would suggest making the size a part of the description. I needed XL, this was not even close. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
2,Damaged,"Bought this bible cover, gave it as a gift. I liked it so much, I ordered another for myself, it wasn't the same quality as the first cover,the color was dull, felt cheap, and had a hole on the fabric inside. I called and reported the damage, was told they would send me another, that was several months ago, didn't recieve a replacement ;("
4,A Book Beyond the Usual,"I agree with the review by Michael Stetwart.If you think quality is only important for the product your company produces and the issue stops there, this book will be a refreshing and inspiring guide.Also check out ""What the Bleep Do We Know""."
1,One star is overrating this thing,"Customer support [is bad]; the drivers and software that I bought in March 2003 had a 1996-1998 copyright date; and worst of all, scans get progressively darker. A scanner that can't handle exposure settings! it's OK until it runs thru it's 'calibration' routine, then it's the beginning of the end. I went thru two different units, they both were terrible."
1,WORST computer peripheral I ever bought!,"Before buying this scanner, I'd had some of my 35mm transparencies professionally scanned, which produced great results but was an expensive approach. I bought this scanner in the hope that it would allow me to produce reasonable-quality scans at a lower price. Unfortunately, although the software worked fine for me, the quality of the scans is so hideously bad that I gave up in disgust after a few scans. Here are some of the problems: 1) strong pink tint to every scan. Although this can be corrected to some extent in software, there is a significant loss of color spectrum that cannot be restored. 2) Poor dynamic range: rendering of shadow detail is nonexistent. The most astonishing thing is that I bought my unit several years ago, and they're still selling this piece of junk now!"
2,the 1800 has very bad tech support.,"it is impossible to get tech support for this product. i have a burnt out scanner bulb, and i know that it will be next to impossible to have it replaced, as i have tried all day to access any form of aid. they want to sell them, but look out, if it breaks. i give the device two stars."
1,DONT BUY IT,i had the same problem as others with this scanner. i used it for a few days and it worked great. i went to use it again a few weeks later and nothing. I manged to get a new one over the weekend and just plugged it in this am and it burned out. No more items from this company for me.
2,Failed Lamp,I had the same problem with mine...I had Lamp Failure with very few hours on the unit(around 15 hours). I had lost my sales slip so could not get any help. I would have given this unit a 5 star rating because when it was working it was a great tool. Too bad the lamp life wasnt better.
4,Slide Scanner,"While cleaning up my garage I found a large box with slides from our travels dating back to 1976.The cost of buying a slideprojector and screen surpassed the cost of the scanner.I have scanned about 200 slides already and am currently preparing a show to watch on TV. You really can not get any one to watch an actual slide show anymore.An other beauty of this transfer from positive film to digital is that I have been able to share these pictures over the internet with old friends.The initial quality of the scanned immage is okay, but the included Photoshop software lets you make wonderful restorations.Although I wished that it could scan faster I am very pleased with this product. Speed it up and I will give it a 5 Star rating.Thank you for such a wonderful opportunity to share old data so easy with old friends and new ones."
1,Very disappointed,"""Wee timorous cowering beastie"" - ""My love is like a red red rose"" - ""Auld Lang Syne"" - so what else? It says on the cover Burns indiscriminately liked women. He had the same fondness for false rhymes. And none of the sparkle of Dickinson.I'm very disappointed and don't like these poems at all. I think they're dull, long and boring. Even worse than Keats' sonnet to their maker. I advise anyone thinking about buying a collection of Burns to go to the library and read some first.Also, I bought a copy from Amazon itself because I wanted it fast. The book is dirty. It looks like it came from the bottom of a dusty cobwebby shelf in a warehouse. I'm getting a little sick of Amazon's prudish vigilance and service like this! And rotten customer service. I wish Amazon, which put all the book and record stores in my town out of business, had a few competitors."
5,Tremendous Anthology,Just look at the list of authors in the book description up top and you know the writing will be superior in every way. I recommend reading one story a day so that you can savour them.Favorites are -Seasons by Jean StewartThe Queen of Hearts by RadcyffeFences by Lois HartCrossing the Line by Robin AlexanderHomecoming by Val McDermidTattered Pages by Marianne MartinAbsinthe by Jenifer FultonBoxes & Dreams by Carrie CarrTen Times Proud by Stella DuffyHands down favorite is 'Best of My Life' by Gabrielle GoldsbyThis collection is a keeper and makes for a wonderful gift.
1,Dreadful,"The promoted big plus of this product is its big display. Ok, it does have that, but the pictures of this show a bright backlit screen. This caller ID has no lit background ! Further, it has an AC adapter input & not only does not include the adapter, but Emerson does not even make an adapter for this. I tried to research the adapter on-line & the only news I got was that I might be able to buy one at Radio Shack, but there was no guarantee it would light up the background. This ID unit is nearly impossible to read & a piece of junk !"
2,save your money on the Emerson EM50 CALLER ID,"Wish I had read the reviews before ordering this item. No back light, very hard to see. The picture shows it lit up. not so..."
2,No AC adapter,"I just received this unit and like it overall. However, as noted in other reviews it does not come with an AC adapter. I have been to several local electronics stores and they can not find an adapter with the right size plug to connect to the display. Nothing in the instruction manual. Called Amazon and they were of no help. I guess I'll just have to use batteries."
3,Emerson Large Display Caller ID,"We got this unit because it's easier to read than our old one, and that part is fine. However, if I scroll through to check missed calls and then pick up the phone to call, it auto-dials the last number reviewed. I finally figured out that I have to scroll to ""End of List"" to stop it from doing this."
1,Don't bother with this caller ID unit,The display is very difficult to view even with the contrast set to the maximum setting. It only worked a few days and then ceased functioning.
2,Could Be MUCH Better,"I bought this device a few months ago and like others said, the display is not very contrasty at any angle, but it can be read in good light. Additionally like so many reviewed, mine failed after a few months. The display went blank, so now all it is is a call indicator light. It does display the information in a non-standard way too, which takes some getting used to. One good things, is it read the CallerID data from every call, where my Uniden phones fail in about 10% of the calls and just say ""Incomplete Data."" Pass on this one, especially when better units work better and last longer for less money. The larger display is of no benefit because of it's poor readability."
1,Don't bother,"We'll, mine is functioning fine, however it is almost unusable due to its very dim display.Not backlit, it's only useful in daylight or when directly lit. Even in light, the dark background and the shiny face cause it to be hard to read due to reflections.I'd certainly pay a few more bucks for a backlit display, but since that's not an option, I say stay away from this one."
2,Very Poor,"Well, it does give Caller ID, it scrolls through and dials, sorta. At that point things begin to go south.There is no back light. The display is very difficult to see no matter how adjusted. The only way I can viably use it is to put a lamp directly over the things.VERY poor design, IMO.However, it's been running for nearly two years (albeit poorly) and it's sorta done it's job.I guess I start a search for one that does what this on is SUPPOSED to this week."
2,"Book should be called ""Woe is Me""","I was amped when I bought this book because I thought it was going to have a lot of information about Flex Wheeler's bodybuilding career, training, etc. He has awesome genetics and is a legend in bodybuilding.While it did contain some bodybuilding information, it was overshadowed by all the bad stuff that happened in his life, long boring stories of him talking about how awesome his girlfriend was, and how low his self esteem was.I was REALLY disappointed in this book and wish I didn't spend my money on it or more importantly, waste my time reading it."
2,Would the real Wheeler please stand up?,"I enjoyed reading this book, but as time has passed and I have reflected upon it further, I have become more and more disappointed with it. Flex now writes for Muscular Development, and his pieces in there vary a great deal in the persona he projects. In FlexAbility he portrays himself as the quasi-innocent, long-suffering victim. The suspicious ""ninja attack"" which supposedly occurred right before an Olympia, thus forcing him to withdraw, is not even mentioned here, though surely it ought to be discussed--if it were real, because that would be a major event in his career; if it were invented, because only by 'fessing up would he really be honest. I think that in this book Wheeler is working really hard to convince the reader that he, Flex, is a good guy. He might be, but methinks this book doth protest too much."
1,NOT Guinea Pig Approved,My hubby got a bag of this for our guinea pigs - it was mostly hard stalks - they hardly ate any of it! What a waste: We'll be switching to Oxbow.
3,Not as fresh as other vendor,"I tried to save $2 by ordering directly from Amazon rather than using Amazon to get it from ""Just Phish."" This hay was not nearly as fresh as my previous order & there are days my bunny just picks at it rather than devour it. Next time I'll order from Amazon but go back the the ""Just Phish"" vendor."
2,Guinea Pigs Won't Eat it,My guinea pigs love timothy hay and usually feast on it all day long. I recently switched to this brand because of the price. Big mistake - they won't eat at least half of what I put in. Too rough and dry. Not saving any money if they waste half of it. Back to the better brands.
1,Dead Animal found in hay bag,Crushed dead animal in Hay bag. Also agree that most of the bag is wasted bc the cavies wont eat it. Threw out the entire bag because of dead animal. Disgusting. wont be buying kaytee products anymore.
1,rabbit won't eat it,"Our rabbit loves timothy hay, but almost refuses to eat this stuff. She'll nibble at it when desperate, that's about it. Try another brand."
2,"First Experience with Hay, Stuff Left Uneaten","This is my first time buying hay for our two new guinea pigs so I have nothing to compare it too. Our pigs seem to like this but do leave some of the thicker stalks behind. Without having a comparison, it's hard to say if this is normal or not. The next time I buy some, I'll have to try another brand and see if there is a visible difference.So for now, Mordecai and Rigby like this hay. I'll let you know if they love the next kind though.*****So I just picked up some new hay,Peter's Nature Hay, Meadow Mix 13.5Lb (12 x 18oz)and I was amazed at what a difference there was in the feel and texture. The Peters hay was so much softer. I have some of both in the cage now and I'll see which one disappears by morning. I'll bet it's the Peters."
1,Avoid Kaytee,"Kaytee makes junk food for critters and this hay is no exception. Small critters need soft, fresh hay, but this hard stuff is only fit for horses. I have 7 guinea pigs, 2 house rabbits, and 2 rats (all rescues). They all prefer Nature's Promise over any other brand of hay."
1,Guinea pig doesn't like it and it is exspensive!,"96 OZ for $15.99! That is not cheap, at least it isn't when it comes to my guinea! My guinea would go through one of these a week almost so I would be spending around 64 $$ just on hay for ONE month!! So I ended up just buying a 12 lb. hay bale for eight dollars! Ive had it for three months and is not even close to being done! :) Do NOT buy this! Just go to your local hay and feed store to purchase timothy hay!!Also like the other reviewers, this timothy hay was not liked by my piggy!!"
3,i dreamt under water,"ok, don't like the premise of someone who is gay changing in 2 minutesto 'straight' , illogical at best.well crafted except for thatacting was faily well."
4,I dreamt under the water....,"While at times strange and otherworldly.....and somewhat heinous, I really enjoyed this movie. It was certainly worth the price and I am very pleased.Thank You.Christopher Haddon"
3,I Dreamt Under Water,I purchased this as a gift and my friend said that he has enjoyed I Dreamt Ider Water very much and has been wanting it for quite a while but had not taken the time to purchase it.
4,A good well written guide,"This book is one of the better resources on how to Upgrade a PC (don't bother too much about the repairing part!). The entire book is very well written, and can infact, be read from cover to cover! Info on any subject, say disk drives, is easy to find. Athough it has lots of hands-on stuff, it makes good reading even for those who don't want to get their hands dirty!"
5,Cereal perfection,"I love these bowls and this line of Emile Henry. I only wish they would bring it back...we want more!They are as you would expect from the picture, though what you may not see is that they hold up very well to incidental dinging. We have a ceramic sink and in the 2 years we've it, no chips. Prior to that, 3 years with a cast iron enamel sink, no chips either. I try not to microwave ceramic though it says it's fine, and it does seem to conduct fairly well, I think it takes a toll on the material and glass is a much better conductor for the microwave."
5,Groovy Paddling Satire Sequel,"You must be a paddler (or at least paddled once) to appreciate William Nealy's zany little collection of humorous sketches and creative cartoons. This collection includes unsolicited advice on paddling, epic adventures, another parody of outdoor equipment advertisements (S&M River Supplies), the ""S&M Campfire Songbook"" featuring the lyrics to ""my Boat"" (set to the music of ""my Guy"") and a host of other funny little penned paddling sketches and comics which, most likely, came right out of Nealy's river sketchbook.It's a groovy little book and another cool thing to pass around on camping/paddling trips to get some laughs by the campfire."
3,humor can be silly,"I replaced an old copy that I had lost. I am a big fan of Nealy, but the humor here is not for everyone and a bit dated. OK it is definitely not Nobel quality or thesis material, but if you are into boating you just may get it."
1,Dummies book makes you feel like one,"There was a lot of theory, but not all that much instruction that could be applied outside this book's carefully designed examples. With the increasing popularity, I spend quite a bit of time flipping through it, trying to give it a chance. As a computer instructor, I wouldn't suggest it."
1,Didn't last through one drilling,"Sorry to say it, but its a poor quality bit; wasted my money; tried drilling through my floor behind the wall as advertised; the product didn't make it all the way through."
2,Good Looking,"Great looking shoe, but beware the Ortholite anitmicrobial moisture-wicking sockliner leaves the soles of my feet raw red? Adidas needs to go back to less abrasive materials. You might have to buy new sock footlines for these shoes."
4,Adidas Women's Cardrona Outdoor Shoe,"The shoe overall has a nice look and form. The sole is soft which makes it easy on walking and running. However,the fit of the shoes has been my only issue. The shoe appears to be alot bigger then the actual size and more narrow then I anticipated. I will give it few more wears to break them in and see if anything changes before I give up on them."
4,Adidas ClimaCool Cardrona,"Insole comfort does not stand up to my New Balance 725's but I do really like the air flow that I get from the ClimaCool. The tongue of the ClimaCool does not stay centered which also bug's me. I got them on sale so, for the price I paid they are still a very good shoe. If your feet get hot, then the ClimaCool is a good shoe for you."
4,"good price, hold a lot of sand","Nice looking shoe. Big mesh is a problem, though, if you run in sand like I do. I have to be careful or I come home with a pound of sand in each shoe."
3,Average,It works well enough but it's really too much work to do the legs. It takes SOOOOO long and still doesn't get all the hair. I have to do it EVERYSINGLEDAY on my legs and they usually feel like its two days after I've shaved.Armpits are a bit better but hurts worse than legs.The price of beauty and smooth skin is high.
4,Results in ingrown hairs,"This device is great--I highly recommend it for keeping underarms smooth. I've found that when I use it on my legs, a week later I've got a bunch of ingrown hairs, especially around my knees. I think the hairs grow back a bit quicker than waxing as well, but it is super-easy and a lot less painful than waxing."
2,disappointed,I have been epilating for almost 6 months now with a less expensive epilator and i wanted to treat myself to a new (and improved) one. I was very disappointed! I had to go over each area numerous times before the epilator actually caught the hair and it was very hard to clean. some pluses this had over my old epilator is a great battery life and built it light. Either way- i'm back to my old one :(
1,"Bad results, Waste of money","I was really hoping to achieve decent results from this product but it did not work as well as I hoped. It was useless! I was better off plucking/shaving each individual hair I had. I bought this to use for my underarms because I thought it would save me time and would take out the hassle in trying to pluck each individual hair, but I found no use for it. It hardly picked up any hair.. I would go over it 5 times, and I would be lucky if it plucked one. Bottom line--don't buy this product, you won't be happy. I was trying to save money and purchase this instead of the No! No! Hair removal.. but now I know why it's better off to pay bigger bucks because you won't be disappointed in the quality."
2,To Much Pain,"While the product is exactly as shown and does exactly what it says it will do - the key to your happiness with this product is to pay attention to the reviews. Important to actually pay attention when a review says it hurts, becuase, it hurts. This is the first time I have ever used one of these products and while I did read the reviews about the pain, I blew it off, I mean really how much could it hurt. Well, actually, alot. If you can't take a fair amount of pain then do not try this product. I tried it out on my mother first and she thought I was mad at her for some reason. I used it one time on me and now it is packed away."
4,Good for armpits & bikini line,"I think it is great for the armpits and bikini line but the other reviewers are right when they say it is very painful for legs and for this reason I am not giving five stars. You may know this but definitely do not use it on your face at all, I dared to try it on my chin and got a little cut that left a scar that took months to fade away."
5,No Pain,"I've never used an epilator until I bought the Emjoi Light Caress Cord & cordless. I received my Emjoi, read the intrustions, then proceeded to work on my upper lip. What a breeze. No pain, just a slight pulling sensation. I didn't prepare my upper lip by washing or exfoliating -- just went to work on the upper lip. The Emjoi is SO much easier than plucking individul hairs with tweezers, which is VERY painful. That's how I used to remove the hair from my upper lip - Never Again!I also used the Emjoi on my legs without any pain, just great results. My skin wasn't pulled and the Emjoi just glided over the skin on my legs, gently removing the hair as I proceeded. Next I will try the Emjoi on my armpits. I don't foresee any problems - but do hold the skin taut.If I ever need another epilator, I will look to Emjoi."
5,Love it!,"I agonized over which epilator to get. I'm new to this but I wanted something better than shaving. Waxing hurt and left my underarms raw. I talked to someone who has used this model for two years and she loves it. I didn't want to pay a lot for something I might not even use, but the price for this one was very reasonable so I decided to try it. I love it! I really think the pain factor is grossly blown out of proportion. It's much less painful than waxing, and that's only a concern the first time you use it. The best description I've read aptly describes the sensation as thousands of tiny electrical shocks all at once. Believe it or not, NOT a bad feeling! I'm very happy with this product."
2,Nor as recommended,"Bought this as a gift for my step mother, and when she used it on her face it did not remove the hair and actually scraped and cut her chin. It stated it was for facial hair removal, but left the hair and removed the skin. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,I thought this was a great purchase until....,"I loved my emjoi for the first 3 months until it stopped turning on while plugged into the wall. I have the corded/cordless combo unit and now it only works when the unit is not plugged in.This makes it extremely difficult to epilate as the unit never has enough strength when not plugged in to do an adequate hair removal job.Now I also don't know who to contact about a warranty, etc.Might have been a 4.5/5, but now I'm thinking this machine is more like a 2/5."
2,Waste of time,"The product itself is made well, but the concept is a little shot. After reading several positive reviews, I thought epilating would be a good way to rid my hair....wrong. I have a high pain tolerance and this was killing me!!! I regularly tweeze, but epilating hurts so bad. And then, I experienced in grown hairs even though I clean the areas thoroughly after epilating. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,Exceptional hair remover... definitely hurts @ first,This epilator is pretty good. It doesn't get every single little hair with one swipe so it does take a while to get them out which is why i would give it a 4. It definitely hurts at first and its pretty loud which made it even more intimidating. After the 1st time using it I guess I just got used to the feeling so it doesn't necessarily hurt anymore. Anywaysssss it REALLY keeps the hair away for a long time!!!... wayyyyyy longer than shaving!
4,great,"It's best to shower and exfoliate first, then it doesn't hurt as much. some of the hairs were too short to grab so i had to run over it the next day. overall, a very simple and easy product to use"
5,snatches from a masterpeice,"The 1980's knew at least one absolute postpunk masterpiece which went by unnoticed: In the Good Old Country Way by the Nightingales. This band started out in line with early the Fall, but on that third album, after pleny changes of personnel, they opened up an entire new musical universe, Kinks-like, though with violin, a wide range of stylistic phantasy, and so much more. Each and every selection was sheer tension, wit, passion and life. All of this was the brainchild of vocalist and main songsmith Robert Lloyd, one of the most impressive voices I've ever heard. In retrospect the two earlier albums Pigs on Purpose and Hysterics sound relatively dated, though they do comprise several wonderful postpunk songs. Now on this compilation you will find several gems from these three albums, and they should not be missed. Yet, In the Good Old Country Way should absolutely reissued in full some day!!!"
5,A Truly Satisfying Picture Book for Small Children,"As a small child, this was one of my favorite books. Somehow, I never quite outgrew it! As a mom now I was hoping to find a copy of this book for my children to ""love"" since mine is a little love-worn after all the years it's lived. This book is bright and engaging, and the illustrations show fun, familiar details of household life that give children plenty of material for imaginative play and vocabulary expansion (Toddlers will repeatedly ask ""what's this?"")."
5,Sneaky Pie is tops!,"I have read every one of Rita Mae Brown's and Sneaky Pie Brown's books, and they are all terrific. Good mystery, good writing--what more can you ask? And don't forget Tucker--she adds her touch to each book as well. I thoroughly enjoy each book and look forward to the next one"
1,This cat meows to much.,"Rita, as an author, reminds me of cotton candy -- sweet, full of empty calories and no substance. Harry will never be in a position to emulate J. B. Fletcher. She exhibits more sense than Rick Shaw (who is a sheriff in name only) does but she is in the bad habit of ""solving"" crimes more in spite of herself than anything else. This novel is no exception."
2,"Rita Mae Brown's ""Cat"" books compared to Lillian Jackson Braun's ""Cat Who..."" series.","A little more realistic than Lillian Jackson Braun's Cat Who... series, and I like to be transported to LaLa Land, not modern-day soap opera situations! One peek into Rita Mae Brown's style of writing is enough for me. I will not purchase another of her books."
3,"Good, but...a little much?","I always love Rita Mae Brown's books featuring Harry, Mrs. Murphy, and the rest of the gang. This one, like the others, had great character description, plot development and the like...but one thing greatly confused me. The cutsey-cutsey antics of the cats got a little much after about the second page...especially since one of them was always moaning about being hungry. The first time they were hungry, it was cute...the second time, it was tolerable...but after that it was redundant and even annoying. I am also confused by the usage of all the ""cute"" words with animals and then, in the next paragraph, utilizing four swear words in the case of a human, either in dialog or action. The mixture is too confusing in most areas."
4,harder to apply than anticipated,"These are nice grips, but you need to really be skilled to apply them if your bike has any electronic gear."
4,Kuryakyn Premium ISO Grips with Throttle Boss,"I have installed these grips on mine, my wife's and several friends Harleys. Installing two more today. Everyone loves them. Very comfortable on long rides and the throttle boss feature makes it easy to maintain highway speed without hand and wrist fatigue."
3,Kuryakyn ISO Grips,"DEcent for the money. comfortable, but they need to package better glue. It was all dried out. My suggestion is Gorilla Glue. Once they are on with that they are not coming off."
4,Good Grips,"As all of Kuryakyn products these are good grips. I am a little picky on grip position, especially being these grips are grooved and notched. So if you use the glue that comes with them, make sure you put them on first, and mark them, to make sure have them in the proper position that you want them in. The glue sets up super fast and does not give you much time for any adjustment once you apply it. I gave it a 4, becasue I wish the throttle boss were a little more adjustable. Greeat comfortable product overall.........."
3,Not a fan,"I have a set of these on my Sportster.The chrome is peeling, especially on the ""throttle boss"". What I really don't like is the diameter of grips, which is personal preference I guess but something to think about. The only other physical complaint is the plastic where the throttle cable goes doesn't seem particularly tough and got chewed up quite a bit for the install and when I replaced the buttons on my sporty.I have other Kuryakyn products I like (foot pegs, rests, bags) just not a fan of these."
5,Fast and Easy,"I'm paying for 1.5 M service from Centurytel. With my previous modem, the best I would get is 800-900 K. With my new Actiontec I'm getting over 1.4 M!! Setup was quick and easy too."
3,setup a bit confusing,"I had terrible time trying to setup the device as a DSL modem only (since I have a router already which supports wireless connections). For some strange reason I couldn't get the device to recognize my ISP as a DSL modem. The instructions seem to be generic for Actiontec Ethernet DSL Modem/router, and are not very clear. I was able to configuring the device as a modem + router. The problem is the router doesn't have wireless. I'll have to reconfigure the device as a modem when I have plenty of time."
2,Didn't fit.,I got this for my '87 Corolla and it didn't fit. Too bad it would cost more to ship it back and get a refund. I better do my research better next time. Seller isn't really to blame because they depend on manufacturer's description which they say they can't edit. I'm just going to cut my losses and put it on the shelf in the garage in case someone I know can use some of the parts.
2,barely works,This kit is hard to work with. I had to trim a lot of pieces off to get the cd player to fit and then had to shove it inside the dash. The instructions tell you where to fit the tabs for different models but that did not work for me and I had to play with it till I could get it to work. I am sure there are better products available which will be easier to install.
5,180 from In Motion but beautiful,"This album took me a couple listens before I became hooked. Unlike In Motion which is pretty upbeat, Eat Sleep Repeat is definitely a huge turn-around for Copeland. It reminds me of Beneath Medicine Tree but it's much more polished and experimental. Eat, Sleep, Repeat has a very msytical, moodier sound than anything Copeland has recorded previously. I absolutely love this cd. At first I was skeptical and then I heard Love Affair and Safer On An Airplane and everything seemed to come together for me. The Last Time He Saw Dorie is gorgeous as well. The lyrics on this album are so well written. They're so jam-packed with emotion, love, and desperation it's beautiful and poetic as ever. I love this band ... they have yet to disappoint me. I'm really glad they chose to experiment as they have because it showcases how much talent they've really got."
2,a let down,"one of the biggest disapointments of the year. i'm a huge, huge fan of copeland, but this cd just doesn't live up to it's hype.if you were a fan of their first album ""beneath medicine tree"" you might give it a try. but it's slower and more mellow.if you were a fan of their next album ""in motion"" then i wouldn't even bother. there are no noticable stand-out tracks and nothing with the calculated edge that the previous album has.the band really has regressed into a slower, easier-listening ""lull"" for lack of a better word.but if that's your thing....but i think i'll pass."
3,"Moving, but not in the way I expected...","Coming fresh out of just getting into Copeland this year, I was still grooving to Medicine Tree and In Motion when I purchased Eat, Sleep, Repeat.Needless to say, it was not what I expected at all.It isn't a bad thing to say in the least. The music is just different, almost as if there is an eerieness to each track on the cd. It definately takes some getting used to, but it is still worth the buy.Best tracks: Careful Now (amazing in concert), and Love Affair"
4,This Album is great,"This album sounds so much like the Beatles. This is pure, slow emo/indie. Get this album if you don't like faster songs and just like to relaz and be slow. This album is high grade. Every song here is somehwat showing in progressing with music. This band is extremely talented. Get it now."
2,Disappointed in wear over time,"I purchased twelve cups in white six years ago. I love the fact that they are shaped perfectly so you don't drip when you drink, and they are heavy so they retain heat well. However, after six years of use (which I realize is a long time) the inside of the cup has lost the hard shiny part of the glaze and when you stir with a metal spoon, it makes metal colored marks inside the cup and stains easily from coffee and tea. I am disappointed because I expected longer usage than this."
1,These mugs must be seconds.,"I have a set of cobult blue Emile Henry mugs. I wanted to add to the set and ordered these. They are not all blue, they have white interiors. White interiors would be fine, however, these looked like they are seconds. The glaze is smeared along the lip of the mug with an appearance of a jagged edge. Two fo the mugs have what looks like a fine ""spray"" of blue glaze on the interior over the white. This light glaze is not all over, just over part of the white glaze making it appear to be very low quality work.I love my Emile Henry mugs that I bought elsewhere and wished the mugs I ordered were the same quality. This is unusual for a product ordered through Amazon."
5,I use these every day,"Look great, easy to clean. Holds a good amount of beverage, and stays cool to the touch even if contents are very hot."
1,Typical Duncan Long Trash,"Yet again we are confronted with a book that is Long on BS and short of useful info, much like every other Duncan Long book. The book is worthless for anything except starting a fire and is typical of the trash put out by Duncan Long."
3,A simple Know-How Book...,"I'll make this short and sweet. This is a good book for learning how to make your own ammunition, but is not for the true beginner. This book does have some useful tips, but there are much easier ways to re-load than is processed here. Over-all, however, it is a well written book."
4,how to spend a nice 90 minutes...,"I decided to see this movie because of the plot and because of his actor, writter, producer and editor (Justin Lo). I saw this movie, like many other gay movies, hoppeing I'll see more of the same (gay stories, bad actors, muscles, sex...) My surprise was I found a very simple, low cost film... With no much money, Mister Lo makes a nice reflection about the lost, first love, family and dreams. Mister Lo show us a honest and intimist story whith no pretentions and I'll wait with no doubt his next films... Sorry for my English.Sin duda, una gran experiencia, una historia sencilla sin falsas morales que te hace disfrutar, reir y llorar con una película que habrá costado el 10% de cualquier producción estadounidense. Buen trabajo Justin Lo."
3,The Conrad boys,"Story - a single mother raises two boys, after being left by her husband. One day she dies and the older son (who was supposed to go to college) takes care of his little bro.But, since he is a gay, we are introduced to a hunky stranger Jordan who shortly after wins the heart of our hero.It could have been a perfect love story, but both the past chases Jordan and the little brother gets confused seeing his older sibling in bed with another boy.Add a father coming back after many years and problems starts to appear one after another.""The Conrad..."" is a film where the leading part, the script and direction are done by one person. And, sorry to write this,but it effects the final result. I think that casting another person to play Charlie would have been wiser choice. Justin Lo should stick to writing and maybe directing, but should keep off acting.Among so many bad gay theme movies, this one regards a little bit of attention."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I can't begin to decide what I liked least about this film: the script or the acting. Justin Lo (star, writer, director) does not convince in the lead role of Charlie. His acting is remarkably bad. The script he wrote has barely plausible plot elements and is generally weak story telling. The one star I have given this film is based solely on the fact that Mr. Lo at the age of 24, wrote, directed, edited, produced and acted in his own first film. That in itself is a feat to be reckoned with."
1,Used to be a friend,"I grew up with Anthony (The Author) I don't want to bash him, but his book was pure fiction. He glamorized a seedy life of petty deals and betrayal. He was always so greedy and shady and this book just confirms his true self. He acted tough until he was confronted by some real hard asses. I just have to remind him (if he reads this) of the time when Chris S. took Anthony's car over some coke and I had to go and retrive it because Anthony was too afraid. I did like him at one time, but I regret any association. A Rat is a Rat."
3,One heck of a dangerous story,The story is local and being local I loved the setting. I knew everwhere he went. The author is blunt but seems pretty real. I wouldn't like to meet this Big John anywhere or even the author. Seems like writing this book was a chance. Whether he will be able to write another book is the question. All local people who liked the movie Blow should read it.
1,"Shark , The Baker's son",This book is based on BS. This person took a low level drug story & blew it way out of proportion. He lies & deviates far from the truth. I know I was there. Many of the stories & chapters are greately exagerated if not even made up. Buying this book is contributing to wealth of a junky . Nothing more nothing less. He blames others for snitching when it was himself who did the snitching. He knocks people who tried to help him & some who have very little to do if at all with the real story . The book is true to the stereotype of a lieng junky
3,handrail bracket,"Well, not too much to elaborate here. It's a bracket for a handrail. Ergo, a handrail bracket. The primary reason I purchased this online was mainly the fact that at Lowe's, they cast around $5.00. And I like to buy things a bit cheaper when I'm able to. So it turns out to be a pretty good deal even with shipping included. Below $1.50 overall per unit. Easy to install, it works!!!"
3,No zone for dogs spray,This product requires frequent applications and usually lasts only a few hours or less. My dogs do not like it.
1,Didn't Deter a Singel Fly!,"For some reason flies have set up home base in my dog run even though I spray it down with cleaner and bleach regularly, wash my dog often and brush his coat, pick up his mess and wash away his urine daily. I've even hung fly traps but they are in mass quantities, it's frustrating. So I wanted to give my poor pup some respite and got this to spray on him and his bedding (that is washed and changed daily) but I can spray this directly on a fly and they come right back and land on his bed. I soaked his bed with it right after a washing, still flies. I've sprayed my dog thoroughly and taken minutes to brush him thoroughly to make sure its on every strand of his fur, still flies come as soon as I stop brushing him. I used the bottle up just so as not to waste it but it did not work even a tiny little bit. I wouldn't buy it."
2,Mercury,"Although I liked many parts of Mercury, a few times during the book I was quite bored and wanted to stop reading the novel. I saw it the whole way through, however, and I found the whole idea to be just average and nothing quite special. I liked a few of the characters, such as Louisa, however I really didn't like most of them, especially Glo. The overal way that these characters thought and acted wasen't very belivable to me, and I was displeased with the ending. Plus, the flashbacks of Louisa were quite long and boring to me.At the same time, I commend the plot and the theme, which I actually did like- the mercury poisoning, the defeat of being second best to your best friend- that is what I enjoyed and found more realistic.So I will say that I mixed feelings for the book, and I say to at least give it a try. Perhaps a different personality will enjoy this book more."
3,not what I'd hoped for,"Based on the product description, I'd hoped to be able to use this rod to clear out my downspouts from the ground up--but what I found is that it combines the worst of both worlds: it's too rigid to bend, but it's too flimsy to break up a heavy bolus of debris. On the packaging, there's an illustration of the rod in action, taking a 90-degree turn inside a pipe--in my experience, though, the rod couldn't successfully get through even a 45-degree bend. I ended up climbing a ladder and clearing the downspout with the rod from the top down, so it wasn't totally useless (and it might work better on indoor plumbing, to be fair). --Subsequent to writing this review, I lent this tool to my friend who attempted to clear his line into the wall behind his kitchen sink. Same result: the rod was too rigid to take any bends."
1,You couldnt PAY ME to wear this crap!,Why would anyone buy a piece of crap shirt like this? I truly hope who ever makes this shirt goes bankrupt and loses everything they own... Destroying our environment is not funny!!! If you want to buy a shirt worth wearing try here [...]
1,If there was a way to rate this negative stars I would,really? THIS is what we want to be advertising? To kill innocent creatures? I'm ashamed of anyone who would wear/sell/buy or even advertise this product (Hem hem AMAZON) this is offensive and cruel and plain idiotic.
1,Why Amazon?,Why is this on here? Disappointed in Amazon for allowing this to be sold on their site. This is hardly funny.
1,"Amazon, pull this CRAP please!!!!!!!!","How could Amazon sell this abomination not to mention putting it in a category of clothing made for the purpose of SAVING whales? I won't be shopping on Amazon until this is gone. Too bad, because I love Amazon. Please do the right thing; surely you're not making enough on this trash to upset MORE customers who WOULDN'T buy it!"
1,Suck it.,"Congrats Old Glory, you lost a customer. Had several of your products in my shopping cart til I came across this garbage. You make me sick."
4,G&D video,"Worth it if you are a G&D fan, or want more information on it. It's put together from fairly crude films, and has unusual narration. The narrator sounds like he's clicking his tongue after every sentence--don't know if that's him or the audio quality. These things can be put aside though for the excellent layout of John Allen."
1,so much propaganda,"All the miraculous claims in this book completely drown out any real information. It sounds like an infomercal. There are wonderful things to be said about royal jelly, but this book makes it sound like snake oil."
5,Most Helpful,"I purchased this book around the time it came out (1997). It has been my go-to guide for everything. I keep looking for a more current version from this author. If you are a designer, this is a valuable guide."
3,scratches easily,"I don't love these as much as I hoped. The white inside glaze has gotten dulled by grey scratches fairly quickly. Also I ordered four but one arrived broken due to inadequate packing materials.My cheaper Williams-Sonoma and Pfalzgraff dishes seem to be holding up much better (although some of the Pfalzgraff arrived broken as well).The red color looks very flat in the photos but seen up close it's actually kind of earthy and speckled, which I like, it has some character."
5,Too good to be true. Another stunner from the mostress.,Extraordinary how Annie sox it to them. Go gettem babe
5,Outstanding!!,"This book is essential to everyones ""Cowboy"" Library. Entertaining, thorough and just a great read."
5,The First Source,"Dr. Shelton has compiled a firsthand source that is the absolute proof of Nuclear Weapons testing. Any nuclear(NOT atomic) testing student should have this as a prime text. Atmospheric, Underwater, Subterrain, High-Altitude; they are all discussed. A current weaponeer only dreams of the vistas, knowledge, data, and sights that Dr. Shelton recorded here.Capt M R Chastain, USAF"
2,not real history at all,"...this work originally appeared in the German magazine ""Der Landser"" under the pen-name of Altmann and is one of Kurowski's more indifferent offerings..the writing style well fits the original 'comic' format. Kurowski is an extremely prolific author but his huge output leaves question-marks over the veracity of much of what he writes here, the rest of it is just sheer hyperbole..eg the lengthy scene wherein Heinz Bär receives a dressing down from Göring...some two pages of dialogue - yet the only two participants died long before Kurowski wrote this....there are no sources, no references, no bibliography...as far as I'm concerned this is pure 'novelisation' ..no other word for itI also have big issues with the translation ..its a little too over the top.."
5,Great book,"There is a notable lack of detailed biographical info on many Luftwaffe pilots. Schnaufer and Kittel are legendary, while some like Weiss and Havighorst are less well-known, but deserving of attention. The information is interesting, well-written and would definitely be useful to anyone interested in the individual Luftwaffe members, most of whom do not have full biographies on them."
2,A hard read indeed,"Not for want of trying, I just can't pick this book up for more than a few minutes at a time. What should be an interesting insight into the players lives as Luftwaffe pilots, slips into an incoherent, cut-up, poorly flowing and badly written book that really needs to be completely re-written.Having many well written books on my shelf covering the Luftwaffe I have to say I find this book very hard to recommend. Try your local library before spending your dollars."
3,Luftwaffe Aces,"Interesting account of WWII European air battles, highlighting German aces. The book took you through the beginning of WWII when German airpower was superior, to war's end when German Air Force was struggling to find planes, pilots. ammunition and fuel to resist the allied invasion of their homeland."
5,Elegant Presentation,"This is the best introduction to ethology I have found: Desmond Morris is a good introduction for someone with no scientific background and ""Foundations"" by Konrad Lorenz uses words that may confuse the newcomer. If you are intrested in this amazing field this is a must. It has a good theoretical introduction and follows with a well organized guide into conducting a clean research. I am an Electronics graduate and found the book very accessible yet powerfully presented."
5,Guaranteed a quality hand-me-down.,This book is a timeless treasure trove of information and I find it VERY hard to put down once I start leafing through it. My ten year old daughter's interest in nature and the great outdoors has grown immensley largley due to this volume and how easy it is to read. Kudos to Reader's Digest!
2,Well Balance,"Lakshya does have good music that is very urban and will appeal to the class audience. Hrithik's fans, who may be looking for another feel good score like Koi Mil Gaya or peppy music in the lines of Dil Chahta Hai may be a trifle surprised by being served a different menu all together. But going by the theme of the movie, the album is pretty balanced and has been composed with style that speaks of class."
2,"No, no, no.","I got sample of this in Sircuit Skin sample kit, and this cream is not bad, but there is no way is worth $150. The main ingredient Acetyl Hexapeptide 3 (ARGIRELINE) is also used in Janson Beckett Alpha Derma CE, and cost less than this cream for 4 oz and has better ingredients (like DMAE, soy proteins, vitamins etc). I tried both and they work similar.If someone really wants to get rid of wrinkles, scars, acne etc I recommend retinoids,for half price of this cream. This is the best active ingredient for the skin, all you need then is good sunscreen for daytime (as vit A must be used at night and is photosensitive PLUS start with lower % as it is very strong). All the miracle, secret creams work only on the top of the skin instead inside, building up collagen.Google it, try it!"
4,Good...but not great!,"I had been looking forward to this game for a couple of months, and was hopeing for somthing amazing after seeing the quality of the xbox version-but I was slightly disappointed. The gameplay is very good with the players making realistic shots and ocasionaly missing the ball-unlike smash court pro tournament 2! But there is slow loading times which can make you bored whilst waiting for a match to load. The graphics aren't half as bad as people are making them out to be-but the crowd are a little umm...fake! I agree the world tour is not as realistic as smash court 2-with the game not even having dates! But when you are actualy playing in a tournament you totally forget that because the gameplay is so good. So I'd say give this game a go-because if you can see past the long loading times and crowd, you will not be disappointed..."
4,Top Spin for playstation 2,"This game did everything that I thought it would, for 7 dollars it was a steal, nice features as well."
4,Top Spin,I am a regular tennis player so this game has a natural appeal. The game is highly addictive and you can get seriously engrossed in the action moreso if the the computer controlled player is highly ranked. The graphics are however aged when compared to what is now available. So too is the commentary which is boring and monotonous. I would love to purchase an updated version if one comes available for the PS3.
2,What happened?,"For all of those who loved the Xbox version, this is trash. The only difference in this version is the addition of new players, and a downgrade on graphics and gameplay. Don't get me wrong, playing is fluid...if i ever get to play. The loading time in between screens is entirely too slow. The judge's voice sounds like Stephen Hawking and on some shots where I see that it's out, the point still counts. If you've never played the Xbox version then yes, it's a decent game. However, the PS2 version is disappointing and I hope to see a mjor change in Top Spin 2 whenever it's released for 360."
3,Not great,I anticipated this game for months and my hopes were to high! The graphics are mediocure. The loading times are slow. No anouncer so it gets very very quiet. You need a 8mb memory card. Oh and this game is kind of tough.
2,Academic approach to computer interfaces,"From a software developer's perspective, Kukulska-Hulme's book is rather disappointing. The approach was very high-level and didn't introduce many concepts that aren't already well-known. The real-life examples were taken from obsolete software products. Reference was made to the pitfalls in developing software for the international market, but only a couple of examples were given, and those only from the French. Perhaps this book was intended for teachers, but there are better and more modern sources, including Nadine Kano's 'Developing International Software' from Microsoft Press."
3,good toy for memory but strange price,"good toy to comfort my childhood memory.But for $39.97 you could get it anywhere in walmart, why pay double ridiculous price here?"
4,That is retarded,"Guy that said prime was a traitor to his own kind, he wasnt he did it to save all the other races in the galaxy and i guess he thought making his race not reproduce was less of a loss than to let all other races die"
4,Optimus Origami,"My nephew wanted Optimus Prime for Christmas, and with the impact Transformers had on my childhood, I couldn't resist. This particular one will confuse you for a full hour. The directions are spatially disorienting. That's the price of intricacy I guess. Opposable thumbs, functioning fingers, fully articulated limbs."
1,Toy Not Suitable For Child Under 12 Yrs. Of Age,I gave this toy to my grandson for his 8th birthday because he is crazy about Transformers. I was not happy to see his frustration when he could not transform the toy from one thing to another. I had my daughter try to work with it (she is 31 yrs. & had Transformers as a child) & she could not even figure it out. It clearly states on the box that this toy is for children 5 yrs. of age & up. You need to change your label. I spent over $150 on 4 Transformers for my grandson & I would have liked him to be able to enjoy it. This is definitely a collector's item for older people.
4,review one,"Challenging toy for adults and equally challenging for kids. Must be able to follow instructions at length. My grandson found it facinating and imaginative. He really seems to enjoy and by using his imagination, developes creativity so I believe it was a good investment as an educational toy as well as a fun toy."
2,Beautiful Truck - Lousy Robot,"I bought this Transformer for my 5 year-old grandson. It came in the Robot form. Just getting it out of the box was a chalenge because it was wired in a manner that made removing the twist ties without a wire cutter very difficult. Transforming it into the truck was very complicated and it took a while for my son and I to do it with the cartoon picture instructions provided. (I am an engineer and my son is a computer genius.) Once transformed into a truck, my grandson played with it for a while and tried to change it back to a robot with no sucess. I found it difficult to transform it even after I had done it myself once. He may play with the truck sometimes, but probably not the robot. He really loved the battery operated horn and headlights.I reccoment buying a truck and a robot separately for a child. It would be far cheaper."
4,Russ,"a little challenging for a 7 year old, but very impactful and fun to chgange, especially after watching the movie."
4,a must own,I think that this is a great new toy of optimus primebut i dont think i would be paying the price it is going for nowI still thought $40 was wow not cheap but worth it.the megatron toy is not easy to change either so i just leave it in its standing postion.when i try to change it from standing form to truck wow it takes some time even though i have had transformers for a long time.I just leave them in vechicle mode much easierWEll I see nothing wrong with metal toys which were made back in the 80's and now they are all plastic boo. Toy recalls on everything these days oh wow.well transformers are not being recalled so that is a good thinga must own toy but watch out for the price.
4,Optimustically Prime,Optimus Prime was the top item on my Son's Christmas list after seeing the movie. We were unable to find the autobot leader at any of our local Toy Stores and Amazon came through. Our Son (7yrs) is very happy with the toy and is quite good at transforming between the Robot and Autobot forms. It has supplied hours of enjoyment thus far and isn't that really what a good toy is supposed to do when you get right down to it!
4,Tranformers Optimus Prime,"I bought this item for a grown up son, his brother broke his original one when they were younger, it was a great toy, and still is a great toy, but I would advise it for older children, as younger children get frustrated transforming them, and can break them."
2,Misleading description,"The description for the setup bars was kind of misleading, it states that the following sizes are included :1/16"", 3/32"", 1/8"", 5/32"", 3/16"", 1/4"", 5/16"", 3/8"", 1/2"", 3/4"", 1"".What is actually included is 1/8"", 5/32"", 3/16"", 1/4"", 5/16"", 3/8"", 1/2"", 1/16"" x 3/4"", and 3/32"" by 1"".No box or holder is included. Sizes are not marked on the brass bars, so you will need either to mark them yourself or build a custom box."
5,Ass kickin',"I love this hot sauce, it burns so good, all in my mouth!I enjoyed it very much, please give me more.You will like this very much, all in your mouth!"
5,Perfect for Cooking Novices,"I had never cooked before so this was the PERFECT book for me! The recipes are for simple, quick, normal food--nothing fancy. Keep in mind that this is seriously for people who have never cooked. Before this book, I had no idea how to even make a baked potato. This book gives you those step by step instructions for the recipes that most people already know...for example, what sides are commonly used with dip and how to make pasta. It's easy to follow and you can really make some fulfulling meals--even with just two ingredients!"
4,Instant Gratification!,"I've had this cookbook for a year, and it has served me well. Not for actual meals, but it's been great for those times when I was feeling hungry for something sweet, salty, crunchy, etc. that took, like, NO time to make.These recipes are no-brainers that produce surprisingly tasty results. I brought this book to Amsterdam when we went on vacation, and after a quick trip to the local supermarket, the four of us enjoyed quick, easy, delicious snacks and lite meals for the duration of our stay. A *fantastic* traveler resource, and a fine book to have for those times when you feel like eating, but not cooking."
2,From Doon: Well written but predictable,"For well over thirty years I have been reading novels by Ruth Rendell and her nom de plume. Spotting FROM DOON WITH DEATH on the bookshelves, I was thrilled to come across one of her early works. Excitement and anticipation, however, soon led to a perfunctory interest. Rendell is an excellent writer, skilled at her craft, but early on it wasn't difficult to identify who Doon was. The suspense was therefore muted and the denouement all too predictable. Had her characters been more complex, this aspect would have at the very least sustained my interest. As it is, they all seemed rather superficially developed, and finally uninteresting."
3,A good into to Rendell,"This is the first book in the Wexford and Burden series by Rendell and it is a good read. The plot revolves around a missing housewife and distraight husband who is trying to find her. The trail weaves among many different people and ends in a surprise.This novel was written in 1964 and might seem a little bit outdated to some readers and the two main detectives are not developed yet. However, the story moves along well and keeps one interested til the end. A good start to a great series."
2,"Wexford's First, Not His Best","Actually this is not Inspector Wexford's first case, but the first that Rendell wrote with him as the main character. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, this was her first mystery, period. And it's surprisingly dull, as far as I'm concerned. The ""shocking"" conclusion to me was obvious from the first few chapters -- I can't tell you why without giving it away -- and now, 30 years later, not so shocking. In fact, by today's standards, it's pretty tame, even quaint. The caliber of Rendell's work soars with her next mystery ""Wolf to the Slaughter"" and from there she just gets better and better. But this first effort didn't do it for me. Don't base your opinion of Rendell on this book -- unless you love it, of course! -- but do check out the rest of the Wexford mysteries, which are sublimely written and -- yes, truly -- shocking in their conclusions!"
3,Introduction to Rendell and Wexford,"From Doon with Death: The First Inspector Wexford Novel, by Ruth Rendell is a pretty decent murder mystery. I have had Ms. Rendell on my ""to read"" list for a long while. I finally read the book after having read numerous professional reviews of the author being one of the best in the genre. I must say that the book itself was rather average. However, as a fan of British mystery series, I know that it takes several novels for a character to grow and develop. I will certainly read on and try to enjoy the other Wexford novels. As to the story itself, there is an interesting mystery with some memorable characters. I was able to figure out the ""who"" in the ""who done it"" a little early than usual.This is a three star book that seemingly only beckons at the greatness that purportedly follows."
4,And this is only the beginning of the series,"Somehow, I've missed reading any Ruth Rendell until MONSTER IN THE BOX and the most recent Barbara Vine novel. This first novel is indeed an expertly constructed police procedural with considerable heart. The characters are quite real and I will be reading this series in sequence (well, I will jump to one from the 80's only because I latched onto a copy, but otherwise will read these in sequence."
3,Doon with Death,Not as good as some of her other books. A bit slow in develpoening the plot & then rushed at the end.
3,English mystery,"From Doon with Death: The First Inspector Wexford Novel (Mortalis)is the first in the series of the Inspector Wexford mysteries by Ruth Rendell. I thought I would take a shot at this English murder mystery about a woman who is found dead in the woods near a farm. She is just an ordinary village woman with nothing eventful in her life going on but her husband is worried and reports her missing.The book was written in the 1960's and the events transpire at that time as well. This was not a really outstanding mystery read for me and I am not sure if I will continue with the series. The only thing I kept wondering and maybe I missed it but where did the name ""Doon"" come from. Was it a nickname or did it have significance. That was the big mystery for me! This is just an easy light read and not all that special."
4,Verizon modem only for Verizon,"I bought this modem to replace my 2Wire modem for ATT dsl that died on me.I contact Verizon but they wouldn't help because my DSL is with ATT. I also contact ATT but they didn't help because it's a Verizon modem.So I fixed the problem by research.Here's how I did it.This modem was blocked by Verizon to only work for their network, so this is how you unlock it.type in code 192.168.1.1/verizon/redirect to your browserthen click off on the next screen.That's it! Now it works with ATT DSL."
3,Ok,"I ordered four and one of them arrived cracked. They also tend to get light scratches very quickly on the white part inside. Another one has chipped already. These are not very durable. They look ok, the outside has an earthy quality."
5,Beautiful and sturdy bowl,"This is a beautiful pasta bowl--deeper than others so it's very versatile. Can be used for salads, etc."
3,Not all together.,"The movie is intense and freaky but predictable; worse, it's plot and sub plot are not woven together at all. In fact, they only really connect at one point in the movie. Adding boring to its list of adjectives."
5,spectacular,"I saw this movie once, went back to see it again the next week and then I saw it again on DVD. Everytime I see the movie I find new meanings to simple dialogs and scenes. Osment sees dead people. I saw a new meaning to life."
4,Terrifying but moving too,"I don't recall seeing The Sixth Sense on any top ten lists from critics when it deserved to be. I thought Bruce Willis was at his best, but his performance doesn't get noted by most people because the kid is so good. Still, the little twist wouldn't have worked without him. He deserved a Best Actor nomination. Now, to tell you a little bit about the movie, the kid can see dead people and it's scary as hell, and it's a lot more scarier than that camera shaking, motion sickness movie The Blair Witch Project."
4,Bruce Wills and Haley Joel Osment star in The Sixth Sense.,"""I want to tell you my secert now, I see dead people."" That's what Cole Sear tells Malcolm Crowe. The movie begins when a former cleint (Vincent Gray) breaks into Malcolm Crow's house.Months later, Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) finds himself working with a troubled child named Cole Sear (Haley Hoel Osment). Cole lives with his dirvoced mother (Toni Collette).One night at a party Cole ends up in a hospital bed after beening locked in a closet at a party where he tells Malcolm that he sees dead people.Malcolm heardly speaks to his wife (Olivia Williams). So how come they live in the same house and not talk to each other?The movie is not trying to make you laugh or make you cry. But it is trying to scare you.2 summers in a row that Bruce Willis worked with a male child star, that he seemed to know what he is doing. Will there be a 3rd summer?"
4,A good buy!,"The story is good but morbid. The actors act very well particularly Osment, he is very cut too. It's sometimes disgustion and frightening.It's hard to guess the end of the story. At all it's good and I recommended it."
5,Sensational,"Ok, I have seen this masterpiece 3 times at the theater and decided I might as well just own the video and pop my own buttery kernals at home.""Sixth Sense"" is a savvy, smart, sensational film satisfyer. I still remember my & everyone elses reaction, at that one moment, when waves of ""...ohh my God...NOW I get it...."" flowed through the rows like blood oozing from a wound.One of the best parts of the video, is when the producers and writers review the clues of the movie.I especially got a kick out of finding out what the color ""red"" meant throughout the film. And of course I had to watch it again immediately!Great flick for intelligent horror lovers.Thanks--CDS"
2,A movie for people who don't know anything about movies,"This was the fourth best film of the 5 Oscar nominees, but it wasn't even that good. You realize the ""trick ending"" about 10 minutes into the film, and how it plays out after that is enough to make you giggle. In terms of Bruce Willis films, this is above average -- better than Armageddon and Mercury Rising, but not as good as The Last Boy Scout and Color of Night. The kid was good, but was given very little to work with, and thank God they cut out those lame scenes with the old man. The fact that the director fought to keep those scenes and hated to lose them proves that he is a cornball who will have a bright future making Spielberg-type films that lack edge. There are at least 56 X-Files episodes that blow this film away."
5,hmmmmmmmmmm,this film is is far too freaky for pg-13.i am 11 and saw the exorcist and texas chainsaw masscure on a big screen and that did'nt get scared!but this scared me.
4,Nice Picture but....(always a but),"The film shows good quality in general, however it closes the door for other audiences even in the USA, and I'm referring to spanish speaking population, therefore I would recommend to include spanish subtitiles even when it is a region 1 dvd."
4,Holy Moly!,"Ok, I don't care how many dead-pans (that word again) talk smack about this movie. All they do is mess up teh experience you will have when sitting ""quietly"" in the ""dark"" to watch it by telling you how it had bad actors or how the effects ot storylines were unbelievable. To heck with all of them. Sit yourself down on a ""quiet"", ""dark"" night and just watch this movie. I had hair stand up on my neck for the first time since Alien back in high school. It was really creepy and the twist at the end made my heart just break. It was awesome. I watch A LOT of movies and rarely give high reviews, but what can I say? I love having a movie inject pure, raw emotion into my bloodstream. This one did it over and over. It is also one of the few movies that can be seen again and again. In fact, the second time you watch it, it's even better because you ""get"" it. Trust me...I'm not a doctor."
1,Disappointed,"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater. However, the DVD was a big disappointment. Not only were the previews in the beginning not needed, there were vital scenes that were missing from the DVD that were in the original movie. These scenes are needed for the impact that the movie should give the viewer. If I had known that the movie was not the original version, I would not have purchased it. When they say ""deleted scenes"" on the back of the case, they don't mean previously deleted scenes have been added, they mean they have deleted scenes!"
4,A Once-In-A-Lifetime Scary Mystery!,"If I had actually wrote a review, I would of gave away the whole film. Every little refrence to the film is a clue because people talk about the big parts. the big parts are the pieces to the puzzle. This film is a must see! And whatever you do:DON""T GIVE AWAY THE SECRET ENDING!"
1,Non-skipable previews unforgivable,"This WOULD BE one of the best DVDs on the market, except that the manufacturer added EIGHT MINUTES worth of previews to the beginning which cannot be skipped. For this reason I will never buy a DVD from this company again. EVER.I suggest you avoid this product."
5,Unique ending,"The genius in this film is the ability of the screenwriter to give a ""pay day"" at the end of the film that is so shocking and rewarding that it makes you want to see the film again and again. This has got to be the best ""surprise ending"" that any film has ever had. It's a triumph in storytelling. M. Night's next film is called ""Unbreakable,"" which will star Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The script for this new film also has a surprise ending. It will be a treat to see M. Night's follow up film."
4,I sensed something good was going on...,"This movie was a revelation. Gripping, chilling and enjoyable from start to finish. The characters are great and the actors even better. Bruce Willis can act...no really he can..and this proves it! Hayley Joel Osment is a superstar waiting to happen...the best child actor I have ever seen. This film is an instant classic...buy it..you'll like it."
1,Incoherent at best,"The fifth element, the sixth sense, what is next? the seventh donnut? The movie is incoherent at best. A patchwork and imitation of other people's ideas, which only makes one feel a little scared here and there. Definitely not worth buying or seeing."
5,A DVD to wear thin...,"You will have to watch this more than once so be sure to have two copys because the first copy with be watched so much it will wear thin! :) I love movies that lead you in one direct then do a complete 180 at the end. I wouldnt really call this a spooky movie although there were parts that were kind of freaky. Bruce Willis was great in this! Cole, Haley J. Osment, was great playing the role of the young kid with the talent to see ""dead people"". He provides the viewer a window into his life of terror and confusion that will make anyones heart bleed with compassion.All the main characters make this movie worth seeing. The ending will make you stop and think about what just happened and why. It was great! :)"
2,...,"While the actual movie is pretty good, the DVD put out by Disney leaves much to be desired. It starts with six long previews of other Disney movies. And if that's not annoying enough, while the previews are playing, you can't access the main menu. You must use the chapter skip button and skip each one individually. ....The extra features are mostly interviews with the director and producers congratulating themselves on what a great movie and ""cultural phenomenon"" they created. Uh guys, while this movie is definitely better the normal Hollywood ..., it is still just an above-average Bruce Willis movie that borrows heavily from The Exorcist. ...."
1,Bad,"Contrived and not very convincing. Bruce Willis was never effective as a psychologist, and characters are two dimensional at best. A poor attempt at a supernatural thriller which relies on cheap scares and loud sound effects. Osment is not a subtle actor, this is not a subtle movie."
1,Unviewable with mandatory previews,"This is the first DVD that I've purchased with Disney's (Buena Vista) dreaded mandatory previews on it and I am unable to view it. I watch DVDs on my PC and the programming at the beginning of the disk causes my system to crash every time. I have over 50 DVDs and have no problems with any of them.Please stop this practice immediately, I will never again purchase any disk with this ""feature"".I enjoyed the movie in the theaters and would love to see it again, but this ""collector's edition"" is useless."
1,10 minutes of movie reviews before you can watch,"The movie itself was good, but every time, and I mean every time, you put the DVD in a DVD player you are forced to watch 10 minutes of BAD movie reviews and they can't be skipped. We paid real money for the DVD, what do they think they are doing?"
4,A well told tale...,"Like a well told tale, The Sixth Sense first captures your attention and then leads you little by little to the twist at the end of the film. A successful child psychologist is shot by an ex-patient who claims that the doctor has failed him in that he was unable to rid him of his fear. This ex-patient, who is now an adult, claims that he knows what causes our fear when we are alone. He does not elaborate, but then shoots the doctor and then turns the gun on himself. A year later we find the doctor attempting to help another child who exhibits the same symptoms that the ex-patient had, apparently in order to try to redeem himself from his incapacity to help the first patient. Only this time around, the doctor now knows that the child's fears stem from his supernatural ability to see and communicate with people who have died. Fine acting by the three main characters. No gore, but this film did make the hairs on my arm stand up."
4,"If you can conquer fear, see this movie!","The Sixth Sense is a really good movie that will fill your mind with suspense and fear. Psychlogist Malcolm meets a boy by the name of Cole who says he sees ghosts. He says that some dead people don't know that they are dead and that some ask him to do things for him. Cole encounters troubles in school, like he insults his teacher and other boys put him into more trouble. I'm not going to give away the rest of this movie but when I first saw it, it creeped me out and put my mind into suspense and total fear. Minus one star for that. This is a movie that you will enjoy being scared about but if you are easily scared, do not see this movie until you are able to conquer your fears. Remember Franklin D. Roosevelt's quote: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself..."""
3,Younger Audience,This movie is overated and good.The Fraidy 5-year old Cole Just does a couple of small favors and that's it.Dr.Malcom Flatface is also dumb too.Forget it.
1,"Oh, the horror!","Terrible. That's how you describe this movie. M Night Shamamalamamala never fails to make dull movies: Unbreakable and Signs included. This movie is stale.When I began watching it I was under the impression that this was a thriller. It's not a thriller in the least. Nothing is scary or really creepy. Although it can be intriguing it lacks suspense. This movie is more ironic than scary. I disliked it because I was overexcited because of the hype surrounding this movie and I was disappointed when it failed to live up to that hype. It also failed to create any lasting impression on me. This movie is basically for people who fear walking in the dark.One more thing. At the end it made it seems as if Bruce is going to heaven but he's not. I know God, He wouldn't let that chump ascend into heaven after being a douche all his life and in his afterlife. That mofo would have gone to hell."
1,WHAT??? A 4 STAR??? YOU HAVE TO BE JOKING!,OMG!! You are right! This movie is good.....good enough to be ranked as a demoralizing film! I don't see how you people can actually say this is a redoubtable film. There is nothing scary about this film and Bruce Willis does not fit into this movie at all! I find this movie to be a real disillusionment to me.
1,I just don't get it!,"I went to see this movie the day it came out, and man I was so disappointed. I , personally , thought that the plot of the movie was terrible, and I didn't think that the kids performance was anything that the movie critics said it was. When I found out that this movie was up for best picture I was amazed that something like that could get nominated before movies like The Matrix which has revolutionized sci-fi movies. If you really feel you have to see a ghost movie with a good plot go and rent Stir of Echoes which is a much better movie. I thought that the whole movie was predictable and felt that the end could have been a little more imaginative. When I left the theater I felt it was one of the worst movies I had seen in years. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. There are so many other great movies out there. If you want to see a really good movie get The Green Mile. You will be impressed."
2,I wanted to pull the hairs on the back of my neck out!,"What kind of horror movie includes the line, ""You know when the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up? That's them."" Ooh, so spooky. (this is sarcasm, kids). I love horror movies, and was very excited about seeing this one, early in its run, only to be profoundly disappointed. I admit there are some quite good things about this movie; the beginning and the twist ending, to name two. Sure, the kid is good, but quite overrated. If you are inexperienced with horror movies, you might find this scary. I just found the special effects to be gross. They could have told the little girl's story without having her throw up all over poor little Haley Joel Osment, for example. Furthermore, I didn't find their explanation believable about ghosts only seeing what they want to see. Overall, the acting is good throughout the movie, particularly Toni Collette, but the plot and explanations are lacking."
2,This was a hit?,"Hard to believe people actually flocked to see this ""horror"" film. It's NOT scarry! It's boring and depressing! The kid who""sees"" dead people is neither likable or sympathetic and Willis also gets annoying."
4,Stay In School!!,"This boy does not like school. He looks like he was eating sour noodles, and wants to act but not in the play. Lucky for Bruce Willes to come along and help!! Mr. Wills tryes to tell him why schooling is important, but the boy is scaring - he looks like he is in an acting class pretend at least three times! The main learning of the movie is that the boy is sad because his pictures have balls of light in them. The mother sees the balls of light and the scaredeness so she can help. They decide to stay in school for the boy's best health, and he becomes popular again!!! I think it's a good message about learning and being friendships, and scary, but not too much, except for Mr. Wills. He is mad at his wife because he died - a tricky surprise!!! She is sleeping and her heat is broken, then Mr. Bruce cries and gives her a blanket. I liked that part. I say walk don't run to see, and save a star for going to school!!!"
3,"It's OK, but not great","The Sixth Sence is a good movie, but despite what anyone says, it's not a great movie. The ending should be obvious within the first ten minutes, and if you can't figure it out, ask someone around you what they think and probably they know. The acting is good, the story line better than most, but it just didn't live up to the hype."
1,Most Overrated Movie of the Year,"Kid sees dead people. Ooooo... scary. Then what? Nothing, that's what! Nothing happens the whole damn movie! And the ending rips off the Twilight Zone so badly it's practically plagiarism! This flick stinks!"
1,Forced Advertising,"To be honest, I really liked the movie. What I didn't like is the advertising for coming attractions at the beginning, which cannot be fast forwarded through. They have taken advantage of technology to control what you can see. Imagine if (when?) software companies start touting their products on their CD's before they will allow you to load their software."
1,"Cool Movie, Shame about the DVD","Let me begin by saying that this is a superb movie. I was hooked from the beginning to the end. One minute you are jumping out of your seat, the next you're almost in tears.... and boy what an ending, I didn't spot it a mile off - and I knew there was a twist. The acting is superb throughout and the production is excellent.So why only one star, well, I couldn't give it zero... the idiots that made the DVD seemed to think that every time you use the disc, you want to watch 4 other movie trailers. Using the features of DVD they have disabled all the buttons until you have watched the trailers - this is possibly the most irritating thing they could have done. I can accept that the FBI warning message is unskippable, but the trailers too! come on guys!Take my advice and buy the VHS version... they haven't found a way to disable the fast forward button yet!VHS 5/5... DVD 0/5"
3,Good movie gets mediocre Blu-Ray treatment,"Good, if somewhat overrated, film has great atmosphere, intriguing story, fine direction and great acting, especially from young Osment (in his debut film role). Worth seeing for sure, although repeat viewings offer diminishing returns.The 1080p transfer is mediocre, with subdued colors, and a flat, two-dimensional look: the mediocrity continues with extras that are warmed over trifles taken from the previous DVD ""special edition"", which, frankly, weren't all that special. The sound fares a bit better, with the rear speakers used quite effectively at times. In all, a slight, barely noticeable upgrade in picture quality from the SD edition, for all but the most discernible viewer.If you don't own any other editions of this film, rent before you buy; owners of the SD edition can safely pass this up... or at least wait, until the price comes down on this one."
2,Great Film - Bad DVD,"I downrated this otherwise excellent DVD because Disney makes you sit through four trailers before the movie starts. Your menu button is locked out, so you can't opt out. I don't mind watching trailers in a movie theater where the cost of the ticket is $8 and I will see the movie once or twice at most, but I do mind them on a DVD that I will repeatedly watch and that lists for nearly $30! I won't own any DVD that forces me to sit through material other than the movie every single time I watch it!"
1,Don't believe the hype!,"There are enough clues throughout the movie to dramatically reduce your surprise at the ending. Although I have to admit that I was caught off guard but not necessarily surprised. But even with the 'surprise' ending, was it worth sitting through the seemingly interminable 2 1/2 hours or whatever it was just for that. Definitely not.Are parts of the film scary... occasionally yes. But by and large the film is incredibly painful to watch. I couldn't wait for it to be over because it moved so slow and I was so bored and not sufficiently frightened.And forget about Bruce Willis' performance being so great. Ben Stein could have done it just as well. Granted Bruce Willis, the man, is extremely cool. Bruce Willis the actor, excepting Die Hard, is mediocre at best.I personally would have walked out if I had seen the movie alone."
3,I no longer like this film,"In 1999 everybody raved about The Sixth Sense. The 'shock' ending that nobody saw coming. I quite liked it in 1999, but subsequent viewings have left me disappointed with the film. It's just very boring to watch now. I am not a Shimalayman fan either which doesn't help matters. Ghost themes were handled more effectively in ""Stir of Echoes"" and ""The Others"".The Sixth Sense is a DVD to rent only."
5,One of the Best Movies I've seen,"This dvd is packed with all kinds of extras not found on most dvds. It has all kinds of long deleted scenes that are great for those who have already seen it. The resoulution could be better but is naturally better than any vhs. The movie is just breath taking. Everything you thought was true is taken away at the end! I love this movie. It's full of drama, suspense, and great acting. One of Bruce Willis' best acting role's in any movie. Plus you have to admire that kid. I've never seen any kid be so good at acting that young. This dvd is great, you won't be dissapointed!"
3,BORING! WANT A MOVEI W/ A GOOD ENDING?,"okay this movie was alright.the ending was not that big and i was not racing to watch it over again.Not Scary(only that tent scene),um i bought this movie on DVD i have only seen it once from begining to end.it was better in the theaters though,you say you want a movie with an unexpected and mind blowing ending? watch SLEEPAWAY CAMP(1983)the best ending in cinematic history."
5,Loved the movie hated the DVD,"Everything good said about the movie is true, but I absolutely hated the studio forcing me to sit through the trailers at the start of the DVD. I will check thoroughly before purchasing another DVD from the makers of this one. I will not pay to be forced to watch trailers."
5,Intense!,"It's hard to say why this film is not receiving Oscar consideration, other than the fact it isn't big and flashy and overblown. Bruce Willis' perfomance is wonderful - exhibiting the depth that has always seemed just beyond him. I coughed up $8 three times for this one (each time expecting to be less interested than before) and found myself even more into it than the last. Haley Joel Osment is great as the boy with a terrifying power (I see GOLD in his future). If I had to have a gripe, I'd say the supporting cast is a little weak, but that is a minor point.I must say, I don't think I have heard ANYONE talking about the ending -- I must conclude that there are some sort of subliminal messages keeping people from revealing it, because I don't think I've EVER seen a movie that hasn't had the best part(s) ruined by the general public.Treat yourself and buy this DVD - it will be well worth it!"
5,Bev from Nebraska doesn't know what she is talking about,"This movie was AWESOME! How many movies do you find people talking about it for days after they saw it, contemplating ever aspect of it? This movie far and away outshines any I have seen. The acting was unbelievable. I don't usually find Bruce Willis' acting impressive but it was AWESOME in this movie. And Haley Joe Osment was so incredible. Beverly makes fun of the short lines added to the movie? What about the idiotic (not to mention RUDE) comments she adds to her review. She describes words as retarded...grow up and learn to be a little more politically correct, and if she doesn't want to be politically correct then at least have a little more class. But anyway, the movie rocks! I can't wait to own it."
4,A Great Thriller!,"This was a great thriller but is not as good as most folks give it credit for. It really has no plot. The kid sees dead people and Bruce Willis is supposed to help him and he does by telling the kid to ask the ghosts what they want. The plot is weak to me. But I did like this movie for its creativity and intelligence. The cold, the red were neat clues. I loved the Rules and Clues bonus on the tape. It really adds a lot to the overall understanding of the movie.If you liked this movie, rent Stir of Echoes an equally effective thriller based on a novel from Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson. This is a more of a horror picture but has an innate morality tale in its story.What makes The Sixth Sense so appealing, ultimatley, is its mood, atmosphere, aura and the acting of both Willis and Osment. That all makes up for lack of a great story - well almost!"
1,Movie great but could do without excess DVD previews,"This is a great movie, no doubt. However the 8 minutes of previews that you can't skip at the beginning of the DVD version are a bit annoying"
4,Have good sense,This has to be one of the most powerfull hard-hitting movie since Titanic. All throughout the movie you are left sat on the edge of your seat. If you watch only one horror movie this year watch this I guarentee it will leave you shell shocked.
5,On-The-Edge-Of-Your-Seat Intense!,"This movie was awesome! I'm not into scary stuff, but with all the good things I had heard about the movie, ...I just had to see for myself. Everything I heard was true! It exceeded my expectations! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, biting my lip with anticipation! I was blown away by the surprise ending - I so didn't see that one coming! Must-see more than once! Get your money out because this is one you will want to own!"
4,Poltergeist for grown ups,"I must confess, up front, that I am not a Bruce Willis fan. Having said that, his performance in this film was sensitive and evocative. He also chose to work with a great script, a wonderful cast and was given competent direction. The master review sums up the film's appeal rather nicely, so I will not repeat what has already been said. Just some impressions, this is not a film that you will view and easily forget. It raises a number of interesting thought bytes with regard to the ""next realm"", if one exists. I found the film to be wonderful viewing, with a relatively gentle touch being applied to all aspects of the story."
5,Technical masterpiece,"I'm not going to reveal the twist that makes this film so special. It is wonderful and makes this film a true masterpiece. To pull this off was a nightmare of timing, camera angles and great acting I'm sure. Bruce Willis has a marvelous chameleon quality that makes him believeable in this role. I'm an admirer of his in his over the top action roles as well. It is a credit to his talent that he can do both. The young boy does a wonderful job as the child that sees ""Dead people"". The roles are developed well and keep you in a net till the end. Anyone who likes a bit of suspense, and a good story line should see this one."
3,Not so great,"Now maybe it's because I had the ending spoiled for me before I saw it, but the first time I saw this movie it didn't seem so great. I enjoyed it, sure, but I sure didn't think it deserved a best picture nomination. Because the ending was spoiled, all the hints thereto seemed obvious and overlong.The second time I watched it it seemed interminably long and boring. There was so much whispering, so many scenes where characters just stand around and talk. The kid did an absolutely incredible acting job, but something about Willis (maybe his hair) wasn't really doing anything for me.There were some neat scenes where a description of an event is juxtaposed with it happening, and a few neat ideas about the dead, but there are also a few plotholes.For a similarly themed movie that is much better than this one, try A Stir of Echoes."
4,better the second time,the first time i saw this film i hated it. i didn't buy one gimmick of the ending. but upon a second viewing i realized that the director was pretty true to his words. i recommend this film...most people will like it.
5,My 3rd Favourite Movie.,"The 6 Senses with this film are : Excellent acting, awesome screenplay, great director, good cinematography and a huge amount of money - and worth it!Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment who deserves an Oscar) is 9 year old boy with a problem. He can see dead people.....like regular people. Meet Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis who deserves an Academy Award Nomination), a child psycholigst who has been sent to help Cole, but can he?The Sixth Sense is worth every penny to buy off Amazon. So if you haven't seen it, I suggest you get your skates on and see dead people....oops I mean rent it from your video store!"
4,A DVD review,"What can I say that hasn't been said? A great DVD to watch again and again, although it losses it's impact somewhat on repeated viewing. The deleted scenes weren't that interesting and I can see why they were cut. You don't really lose much. The director explains why he cut scenes which was nice. I think the film would have lost its edge if they were included. The interviews with the director was very interesting watch out for this guy I think he's up and coming. This is one DVD I'm not sure if I'll add it to my collection. The preview trailers are quite annoying."
3,I saw that one coming,Oh dear. Surprise ending? No. You'll work out the end long before you get there. A reasonable movie with atmosphere. But a classic this ain't. I was told it was amazing and left disappointed. Don't be fooled. A good film? Yes. Worth watching? Certainly. But just be aware that it isn't as good as some may have you believe.
1,20 minutes of movie trailers!,"what's the deal with te half hour of studio promos at the beginning of this DVD? You can't even go into the menu and skip through it, you have to either agonize through it or fast forward!...I sincerely hope Disney does not create a trend by doing this."
5,"Perfect movie, Now Im scared to be alone","God where do I begin, this movie just was so unpredictable and well thought out. It seemed so real, I dont know if it was because of the actors, they fit their parts absoluetly perfect. I always look for mistakes in movies and this one had a minor one, it was when bruce willis and the boy were in the church and they were talking and the priest didnt say anything to the boy like who are you talking to? Besides that it was simply perfect. I dont know why people said that it was boring because I didnt want the movie to end. What a shocking ending. I got the chills at least 10 times during this movie. Excellent performances!"
3,"Good film, but where's the twist?","""The Sixth Sense"" is a good film, with some excellent performances from Osment, Willis and Collette and I must admit that certain parts did give me the creeps. However, I failed to be stunned by the alleged twist within the film (which I will not reveal should any purchasers not have seen this film). Maybe I'm just more attuned to these things, but I thought that the 'twist' was so telegraphed at the beginning of the film that I sat waiting at the end for another twist that did not come (and this was going to the film 'blind' with no prior knowledge of content from reviews, trailers or comments from others). I recommend that purchasers of this film check out ""Jacob's Ladder"", also available from Amazon on DVD and compare/contrast. So, a good film, but overhyped in my opinion."
3,Ok but not great,"Don't get me wrong, I've never seen Willis act better and Michael Caine was right when he said HL Osment should have got the Oscar. But... the script lets them down. I can't say why without spoiling the end, but it just doesn't hang together.I felt like the crazy lady in ""Misery"" complaining about 1920-era matinee series - at the end of one episode the hero goes over a cliff in a train and it blows up. But at the start of the next episode he manages to jump out and escape.The movie is good while you watch it, and if you can disengage your brain at the end you can ignore the inconsistency. But if you can't, you may feel disappointed.This is a good way to spend 2 hours, but rent it - don't buy it."
5,Clever and Scary!,"This film is extremely intelligent and has a creepy atmosphere that elevates the suspense. Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette deliver star-making performances and are very believable as mother and son, Bruce Willis also shines as Dr. Malcolm. But the real star of the movie is the craftsmanship by writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who wrote an extremely intelligent screenplay and added 'some twists and stuff' to make it extremely entertaining and smart viewing. Every scene is packed with clues and little details that make you come back and see it again. Tense mood and creepy atmosphere will satisfy suspense and horror fans. Rewarding. Extras: spot director M. Night Shyamalan in a cameo. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!"
4,how tricky it is!,"The director made the movie slow(bored?) at the first 90% of it, in order to thrill us at the very last in the largest extent. He is not just bring us a movie, but also a puzzle game that we all don't know we are playing during watching until the end. I think that's why this is one of the best movie this year since no(or very little is more appropriate) movies made you felt like playing a game.Undoubtedly the story is very creative, but I would doubted that the story is of a little bit inspired by a bestseller 'Sophie's World'."
1,An abuse of DVD technology,"The studio forces viewers to watch 8 minutes of trailers before we can do anything with the disk! This annoying, 8-minute commercial is forced on us *every* time we run the disk. This is an abuse of DVD's abilities and should not be tolerated by the movie-buying public."
2,I thought I was the only one,"SPOILER (sort of) AHEAD. I was so glad to see that I wasn't the only one who figured this movie out from the beginning. It was driving me crazy that this kid was on a bus by himself and then wandering around a stranger's home during a funeral and no one said anything. The DVD has the director talking about all the little clues you weren't supposed to notice. Unfortunately, I felt they were all obvious. I gave it 2 stars since the look of the film is good and the relationship between the kid and Bruce Willis is charming. The most disappointing thing about this movie is that it could not stand up to repeated viewings. Great movies provide new things every time you watch them; like great books that you discover more with each reading. Too bad."
2,I don't get it.,"Talk about over hyping a movie. GEEEZ! What was the big deal, you people act like this is a state of the art movie that has never been done. The twist ending was obvious and the acting was poor.An obvious rip off of 2 or 3 movies (poltergeist, and excorsist) only it was a bad rip off. Thank god for American Beauty and Magnolia or this year would have been a total cinematic waste.ciaop.s. The ""twist ending"" is only a twist if you are of utterly low intelligence and adapt to Steven Seagul movies."
5,DVD has many EXTRAS,"The story was excellent with a terrific ending. I really love the extras that you get with this DVD - like the edited parts, excellent...."
2,Not as good as people make it sound,"Do you wish to see a movie were someone is barfing all over? How about has their face smashed in, or simply the back of their head ripped off and bleeding? Well, if you do thats ok. But for most people seeing things like that make their stomach turn. I do admit that sometimes the story grabbed you in. But the suspenceful parts didn't last long. So, if you wish to see this movie because of all the hype. Take it from me, it's not worth the time."
2,Over rated and hyped for nothing,"Don't get me wrong, it was a fairly good movie, but in no way did it deserve the hype it received. It was rather slow moving and the surprise ending does not really justify the many scenes preceeding it. If you want a good action suspense/horror, check out Stigmata."
2,I see bored people.....,"OK..the greatest thriller of all time like the advertising says...NOT! All in All its a big letdown, no real story to speak of except for the ""trick"" ending - of course i was tempted to see it from the beginning at that point - but didnt want to sit through it."
2,boooorrrrrrring!,"Jeez man, I can't tell, was I supposed to feel uncomfortable during this movie or was it just because I was so bored? The story is stupid, Bruce Willis is miscast and the supporting actors as well as the sub-plots were nonexistant. I cannot believe this movie was held in such high regard by the Academy. The 2 stars I give this movie is only because of that kid, playing Cole. He is an acting prodigy and completely stole the show, especially when considering that the script was so weak."
3,"Great Payoff, Slow Start","Sure, The Sixth Sense had a great ending, but the whole first hour was a bit slow. Once you got to the end and looked back on it, the whole thing was intriguing, but it was still a long first hour. The only thing that sustained me through the first hour was the absolutely gripping performance from Haley Joel Osment (who was robbed of awards this award season!)."
4,DVD - almost perfect,"I really enjoyed this movie, so I picked up the DVD version as soon as it came out. The disc is pack with bonus material and for the most part the quality is great, but I was disappointed by the movie previews they placed on the disc before the menu pops up. While you can skip them by hitting next, I felt that placing the previews on the begining cheapened the DVD."
4,Well I never....,I consider myself to be an *ace* plot detector. I pride myself on picking up on the clues and never being blind-sided by the usually hokey Hollywood plot twists. I even knew there *was* a twist in this movie and I still never saw it coming.Wow. Even without the ending this is still an absorbing movie. Willis gives a superb and selfless performance - as does everyone in the movie.Glad I bought it.
4,"Moving, Frightening, and Fun!","I really enjoyed this film. A crowning achievement in the horror genre. It is a fantasticly scary film! The Sixth Sense is about a young boy (played expertly by Hailey Joel Osment) who has a sixth-sense...he can see dead people! A truely chilling screen-play, wonderful special effects, and top-notch acting make this one a winner!"
4,I see dead people...,"This is a pretty good movie, it wasn't all THAT scarry, but it was entertaining enough to watch. It did have some scarry parts though so Ive got to give it some credit there. 12 yr old Haley Joel Osment plays the main charecter, and hes so cute! This is a good movie!"
5,Well Casted,"Sixth Sense has had one of the best casts that i have seen for ages. Choosing Bruce i thought would be a bit dodgy as we were used to seeing him in the Die Hard films, but he rose to the challenge and was fantastic and worth all the money he was paid. Im glad that Toni Collette was chosen as she is my favourite actress, and she has already taken on various different roles before(Muriels wedding, Emma) so i knew she would be able do the role justice. The film has an excellant story line about a young boy who sees ghosts and seeks help from Bruce Wills. What happens through the film is some of the best effects i have seen in a film of this standard and without giving too much away, i would like to say that this film has a twist at the end that more or less makes the film`"
4,Sixth Sense - Excellent Film - Poor Soundtrack?,"Excellent film, never guessed the plot - but I was disappointed by the hissy soundtrack - I think the film is recorded too quietly as well but it was definately not my system!"
1,8 minutes of previews,Every time you watch this DVD you are forced to sit through 8 minutes of movie previews. Some of which have already made it in and out of the theaters. You are not even given the option to skip them. What a way to ruin a great movie!
3,I have to re-review this DVD because of its opening,"This is a great movie, and a great DVD, but I can't understand why they put movie trailers at the beginning, who would like to see those trailers EVERY TIME you start the DVD. And worst of all they disabled the MENU OPTION, so you have to press chapter forward a lot of times, this is the first time I see this on a DVD, this is supposed to be a collector's edition, you'll end hating the movies on the trailers so much, you'll never see them on screen. THe stars are for the DVD intro, NOT for the Movie itself. The DVD options are great, cool extras, but they ruined it all with this introduction."
5,An Unexpected Hit,"The Sixth Sense is a wonderful movie. M. Night Shyamalan was only known (just barely) for one movie up until this point,Wide Awake, so this was definitely unexpected.The movie features Bruce Willis as a child psychologist who sees a patient (Haley Joel Osment) that can speak to dead people. The movie wnet on to score five Academy Award nominations and a place on AFI'a 10th Anniverary list.This version of the DVD, the single disc version, features a number of featurettes and deleted scenes, definitely worth a look.Highly recommended."
5,Grat Movie!,This definently was a great movie! I especially enjoyed the ending. It is a must see film.
5,SCORE!,This movie is the best movie I have seen in a while. The acting was incredible! Haley Joel Osment really knows what he is doing. And Bruce Willis was phenomenal too. This movie is great and kept my heart pounding the entire time. And the ending....WOW! Unbelievably awesome ending! A must see for all movie fans!
5,The Best Unexpected Ending,I loved this movie! Bruce Willis was great as a psycologist dealing with his own problems at home with his wife. Haley Joel Osment deserved all those Supporting Actor awards he was nominated for!
2,So so,"The ending was the only thing that lifted this movie above the lousy level. It was a real surprise. But the movie as a whole was clumsy and contrived and formulaic, and basically a ""Twilight Zone"" episode with a big budget and an over-compensated star."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I got to the end of 'The 6th sense' still waiting for something frightening, or even mildly thrilling, to happen... Not a bad movie per se, but the way it was hyped I expected much more. The acting, however, is superb. As the plot unfolds, the movie swaps genres, getting from horror to thriller to social drama to tear-jerker, making it sometimes confusing and difficult to understand where the director is trying to take you. The ending, whether or not it comes as a surprise, is rather disappointing. All in all, it made me think of some remake of 'Always', 'Ghost' or 'City of Angels', all based on the theme of the dead trying to communicate with the living. 'Stir of Echoes' with Kevin Bacon, based on a similar theme, is less ambitious but, in my opinion, more efficient.All in all, 'the 6th sense' is a fun movie but still far from coming even close to being one of last year's best."
5,The Sixth Sense,One of the all time best psychological thrillers I've ever seen!Its ending will make you think long and hard about death and the afterlife.
3,The Sixth Sense is just so-so....,"This was a good film but not nearly as good as what people are making it out to be. The premise ""I see dead people"" is weak because they hardly show up. This is not a movie that can be watched over and over. Once the surprise ending is blown that's it for future viewings of this film. A much better film along the same lines is Stir Of Echos"
1,no excitement,This movie was not what I expected after all the hype. It isn't exciting or scary. Nothing big happens. The fraidy kid does a couple of small favours and that is it. The surprise ending as it was described is also a yawner.
1,Not scary at all,"I don't understand why this movie is said to be very scary. I don't even call this a horror movie. It's far from horror/suspense movie that I'd call this a simple drama. I almost fell asleep while watching this movie. I'd say this is another version of 'Ghost'.Second movie by the Shyamalan (Unbreakable) is better, but still not a masterpiece.If you're really curious about this movie, renting would be more than sufficient."
4,6th Sense Gift,"This movie was purchased for my son who has a passion for Bruce Willis movies. He has seen this on rented DVD's several times, so I'm sure he'll be more than glad to receive his own copy."
5,Best kind of horror suspsense there is,"The best thing about this movie is that it really puts chills on your skin without having to resort to hacking and slashing among a teen-orgy like just about every other horror movie. Great move, really gets you thinking and is even touching."
5,haunting,"this leaves you with chills down your spine. it'll make you feel sorry for the little boy that he has this power, to see dead people. the beginning is a real grabber and the ending is phenomanal. Haley Joel Osment is right on the money and Bruce Willis is powerfully superb. M. Night Shaymalan brings you into something new for a change"
3,Good idea-BAD execution,"I would like to say that this movie had a good idea, but I wasexpecting much more. This movie was advertised so much that I wantedmore. I expected more dead people, the movie to have a darker atmosphere. What we got is movie that was getting pretty boring by the half way point. The ending was clever. The only BRILLIANT part of the movie was the little kid's acting. If you liked this you will also like ""A stir of echoes"" , I prefer it more. END"
3,"Ok movie, but too much hype","Please do not get me wrong, this was not the worst movie that I have seen, but I didn't particulary care for it. The acting was good, but there was so much hype about the ""unbelievable"" ending, that I went looking for clues, and figured out the ending after the first five minutes of the movie."
1,are you kidding me?,this movie really sucks big time...waste of time watching this..i had a great deal of expectation but all went to waste..it should be cathegorized as a romance film more than a horror one...disappointing.
1,Another M. Night Shyamalan disaster,"Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment do their best, but are undone by the ultimate auteur of our age, M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a ""surprise"" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.If you like any other of his films, you're probable slow enough to like this one. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"
5,M. Night Shyamalan's best movie,"This movie impressed me, it was so well done and so creepy and grose sometimes,Bruce Willis is excellent and the boy is also excellent in his role.The dead people looked realistic.At the end the movie has an unexpected twist.It will make you think...am i dead?!... Who could say?.M Night Shyamalan is a great director, he prooves it with every movie he makes."
2,Incredibly Over-Rated,"Obvious twist-ending, failed attempts at atmosphere, and a few good scenes. Rent ""Carnival of Souls"" (1962) instead--that is the movie deserving of The 6th Sense's praise."
1,most overrated ever,Did anyone really like this piece of madagascar manx cat stool? I mean this whole movie is boring as all sin without a gak even by a knife to someone's throat and the psycho thriller aprt is so lame... a rating system!
1,MEDIOCRE,"A popular and mediocre movie that has mediocre but not yet famous fans. Why? It gives the mediocre fans hope in life. He made it (the mediocre director, the winner), therefore they can make it as well. Quantity over quality, or just good advertizing. It is as simple as that. Will appeal only to the film illiterate. One out of five for the mother (of the medium) who seemed as irked and confused as some of the viewers, who ""don't get it"" - right!, and who happened to come across this ""production""."
1,TERRIBLE,"One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I heard good things...all lies. There is NO surprise ending. Any moron that can't figure out the ending needs serious help. The movie should have been comedy of the year, due to special effects and acting. Pathetic."
3,An Entertaining film,"It's somewhat scary, and holds your interest for sure. But, sorry; IMHO just not a five-star film by any means. Willis' character just gets tedious after a while, and there should be just a tad more plot development. The ending can be surprising ... or not, depending on hoiw much you catch during the movie. Worth seeing."
3,What's wrong with this movie?,"Okay, let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie, that I thought the acting was good, but that I ultimately regard it as an inferior Jacob's Ladder. The story is so transparent that within the first 15 minutes you've figured out the ending. After that it's just a question of how the filmmakers take us there. The script is an insult to the audience's intelligence.If you watch the interviews with the filmmmakers on the DVD you find out why. They seem so preoccupied with the rules of the film's construction in relation to the plot that they end up just giving it all away. They're so happy with themselves it's almost funny.I had only seen the trailers before and heard that the movie had an awesome surprise ending. This was negated by the beginning of the movie - literally, bang goes the surprise. Had the filmmakers left out the first scenes the movie would have worked a lot better in keeping up a level of suspense."
2,"""I see dead people....like this movie""","I just saw this movie and I can't believe so many people think this movie is a classic! While it's not a bad movie, it shouldn't have gotten an Oscar nomination for best movie. Being John Malkovich was a much better movie and should have gotten nominated instead. Even Magnolia! But still, it should be worth seeing on DVD. Just don't tell me Sixth Sense was better than Blair Witch. It isn't."
2,Bruce Willis is Dead Within 15 Minutes,"Bruce Willis is shot in the beginning. It leads you to believe that he doesn't die, but he does. That's why he never speaks to his wife. I mean c'mon! It's a Bruce Willis movie and he dies! No way am I gonna give it more than 2 stars! He's the Jackal for god's sake! He prevented Armageddon and was the Last Man Standing! Make no mistake about it, this is NOT a horror movie. This is a ""spooky"" drama, not a jump out of your seat chiller. It's okay, but not as great as the hype proclaims it to be."
2,Lackluster transfer and even more disappointing features- get the standard DVD instead,"The Sixth Sense is a fantastic movie, one of my childhood favorites. I remember it all, the ghost passing by the bathroom door at night, pukey girl in the tent, and the twist ending that had us on the edge of our seat. I had the tape of this and would watch it every day in the summer. I am very glad this is out on Blu-Ray, but as soon as I began watching it, about 30 minutes in, I already had a bad feeling. The picture is terribly grainy in a few bits, most notably the scene where Cole goes to calm his mother down at night. Cole's mom's nose has a bleed on it (slight red ghosting effect) during the ""Picture scene"" and Malcom's hair bleeds a bit too in some scenes. And the special features were disappointing too, they were just the special features on the Vista Series DVD. Sound quality is OK, but other than that, you're better off buying the DVD."
4,Good &#65533; but not quite as good as its reputation,"The Sixth Sense is a thrilling movie. An emotional movie. A moving movie. Kind of even a philosophical movie.Although it is pretty predictable, and the story brings no surprises and no side-plots, it is well-told and very well filmed. And the boy plays absolutely brilliant! A great up and coming talent!"
5,Masterpiece,"I found that this movie was very well done.All the performances were astounding esspecially by Bruce Willis,Haley Joel Osment,and Toni Collette.It's very well done film with a original story.I feel this movie should've won more awards for it's originality.It's a great film don't miss it."
5,Pure Brilliance.,"The Sixth Sense is ingenuis and pure brilliance. I was amazed at how good the acting was, I was thrilled with how good the story was and I was enthralled at how good the direction was. Dare I say one of the best movies of the century, and the best thriller ever made.The original and how-did-they-think-of-that-idea story is based on how Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) can see dead people and how Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) can help him with his problem. You have probably heard alot about this film, if you haven't seen it, you need to get together and go to the video store and see The Sixth Sense, because you can't miss it."
4,"Compelling and thought-provoking, but flawed.","The Sixth Sense is one movie that draws you into its web, and won't let you out until you've devoted a lot of mental time and energy to it. I'm not, however, sure all the work is richly rewarded. Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette give powerful performances, but Bruce Willis's central performance is lacking, and drags most of his scenes down with it. The movie feels like it truly needed a much stronger actor and a more compelling presence at its core, and it would really have given the movie much more emotional weight. The DVD version includes some great extras, and is a must-have for every movie enthusiast. The VHS version, missing the additional enhancements, is still worthwhile, but not essential. Regardless, The Sixth Sense is still entertaining, and worth sitting through once or twice, but probably not much more."
3,It's okay,"The movie is fine the way it is with good acting from Osment, allusions to interruption from the ""ghost world"" (the color red, cold temperature), and the twist. It just didn't leave as much an impact on me as it does on others. The movie wasn't as scary as I thought to be, and I was scared of Event Horizon. Plus, I just can't get over the fact that Bruce Willis goes through everyday life not knowing the people he love are ignoring him. Sure, Mr. Shyamalan explained it simply as ""ghosts only see what they want to see,"" but I don't buy it. Suspension of disbelief is important in movies, but I just can't do it for this one."
3,Not as good as the hype,First off the rounds and rounds of previews let too much of the plot leak. The movie is good and definitely worth a rental if not a purchase but I didnt see a 5 star movie here. The ending was anticlimatic and left questions unanswered. Big bonus for DVD fans with all the extras. Gotta love that.
3,"Great movie, but how many times can you watch it?","I don't think many people would argue this was a great movie, but like any movie with a suprise ending, how many times can you watch it?"
4,Great twist to suspense!,"Overall, enjoyed the movie! Never suspected the ending for those ho like a great twist! Sound quality was excellent, video quality was excellent, and even though you can fast forward the trailers, they should have been an option, not a requirement."
4,Defect of the Jade.,"Not too many to say, it is generally a great DVD that I'd been wanted for a long time, everthing is just great about this movie, the only defect is that there is a break in the movie, when it runs up to 57'27'' and 59'28'' you could apparently heard the break of the sound between scenes, I thought that was the only defect about this DVD."
5,The Return of Good Horror Films,"""I see dead people"". If you've been hiding under a rock for the last few years you missed this fantastic horror film. The return of good horror films after a long long dry spell of Scream, Friday the 13th and all the other stupid horror films. This is a fantastic smart horror film. A must own."
2,Overrated. And How.,"Unbelievably over-hyped and carelessly fashioned ghost story, critically adored mainly due to a stand out performance from Osment. Unfortunately his adeptness in handling the material cannot save a film which as a whole is unsatisfying and incoherent. The central premise intrigues, but the twist ending is inadequately set up, contextually makes no sense (so bruce Willis never changed clothes, or opened a door, or spoke to anyone other than this child and never figured out anything was wrong? Wonderful psychologist) and is utterly plagiarised from Herk Harvey's 1962 film 'Carnival of Souls'; a laconic Willis seems content for the most part to sit back and look as bored as I was by about 45 minutes in. Trite Hollywood fodder unfortunatly described by some as a Masterwork; there are numerous directors with greater talent who could do with this kind of recognition."
3,They should never have deleted the deleted scenes,The original uncut version is a 5 star movie. I originally saw the original version that still contained the deleted scenes. When I watched this version I noticed that they were missing. They are powerful and beautiful scenes. To have to watch them separately from the rest of the movie just hurts. Does anyone know what I should buy to get the unbutchered version?
3,"Good movie, but lacks in rewatch value.","This is a very interesting movie. The characters are beautifully played. The plot is certainly an interesting one. It's really more like a mystery than a thriller. You spend a lot of time trying to figure out why the dead are bothering this kid. You go through the same efforts that the psychologist does to figure out how to help him.Also, this DVD release includes some very cool deleted scenes. Often, the deleted scenes are deleted because they didn't add anything to the movie, but these were deleted basically because they added too much. They were cut for time, or because they ""gave away too much"". The director's commentary is also great. I give the special features of this movie Five stars.The downside to this movie is that once you've seen the ending or figured it out, it doesn't have much rewatch value. You may go back once or twice to find all of the ""clues"", but once you've done that, you probably won't want to watch it again."
2,huh?,"Why did this movie make so much money? Stir Of Echoes was a much better film, because it did not rely on a 'surprise' ending in order to have any impact. All this movie is is a setup for the end, which I only thought was a surprise because it made no sense at all. Can someone explain to me how this guy went around living his life for A YEAR being invisible to everyone and didnt realize something was up? Supposedly thats what happened, because he had been dead and living as a ghost for a year when the meets the kid. This plot hole completely ruined the movie for me, and I don't even see how it was made with such a glaring mistake regarding its main attraction (the surprise ending) . If someone can explain it to me, then please email me at wrichardshad@aol.com."
3,Does an excellent ending compensate for a mediocre film?,"Haley Joel Osment provides a strong proformance, Bruce Willis isn't half bad (he's not half good either). But ""The Sixth Sense"" stays flat-footed and mostly grounded because it doens't have atmosphere. Your never all too scared for the young boy or his dealing with his problem. It is an internal struggle that doesn't surface for the viewer. We can't relate and do to lack of character developement we don't want to. It has it's strong points however, M. Night Shyamalan looks like he knows what he is doing and the ending is phenominal. Watch it for yourself."
4,Touching story...,"Besides the scary ghost things and story, it have some touching story behind, story between son, mother and their grandma; and the lovers..."
4,A thinking person's horror film,"I didn't know what to expect from this film and was glad I went in without expectations. This is a clever, non-gory, scary film.Young Haley Osment and Bruce Willis give very convincing performances. After you watch it the first time and the surprising ending is revealed you'll want to watch it a second and third time with new eyes, catching all the things you may have missed the first time."
3,"Good Movie, Poor DVD Production","Title says it all, when will these studios and directors figure it out? Just think how exciting will be a year from now when you want to watch this DVD and you get to see...""now in theaters...' and previews for the stupid movies they were hyping at the beginning!For me...I won't purchase any more movies from this studio or director."
5,excellent choice,Excellent suspense/thriller film for anyone that is into that genre. Bruce and Haley were exceptional in the film all the way. Rent or buy it.
4,The twist makes you jump,"Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a distinguished child psychologist haunted by the painful memory of a disturbed young patient he was unable to help. So when he meets Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a frightened, confused 8-year-old with a similar condition, Dr. Crowe seeks to redeem himself by doing everything he can. Nonetheless Malcolm is unprepared to learn the truth of what haunts Cole: terrifying, unwanted visits from the restless inhabitants of the spirit world. The movie will make you jump as the plot unveils. It has a twist at the end that surprised many although the restaurant scene didn't mesh with the twist and might have given it away. The discovery of Cole's incredible sixth sense leads both Dr. Crowe and Cole himself to mysterious and unforseeable consequences. 40/50 = 4.0 stars."
2,There`s Something About Bruce Willis,"Enough about the ending already, sure it was a clever move, but there`s so much more to find here...right? Well, that`s the problem, this movie works nicely on the first viewing, but I don`t really feel the need to watch it again. It`s not very engaging, moves too slowly and if it wasn`t for the final twist it would be quickly forgotten. Ok, the cinematography is alright, the acting good and the mood adequate, but there are a couple of plot inconsistencies and during the most part I was just waiting for something to happen. The ghost element is well done, though, but Shyamalan can do better (""Unbreakable""). A promising debut anyway."
3,So he's dead,"Bruce Wills and Haley Joel Osment both give good performances in this one.OK the movie was cool how they hid Malcolm Crowe(Bruce Will)being there when he really isn't. I watched it a second time found it a bit better,but not great. I give it 3 red stars. the director had some good Ideas which I liked just thought it could of been more fine tuned ,but good overalll. A movie to see twice.Enjoy"
2,Very Avergae,Aside from the Boy there's nothing original at all about this film.while I Have dug Bruce Willis's Work from the past this is not one of his Best.I Have seen this kind of film so many times already.if you combined elements of this Film&The Matrix then you would have had a Classic.only Haley Joel Osment saved this Film.but his Performance was Great more than i can say about the film.
3,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I'm sorry to go against the hype, but this was NOT a great movie. Better than average acting and serviceable cinematography welded to a sappy script with one big ""twist"" do not make classic cinema. The DVD ""extras"" confirm that despite Shyamalaw's cockiness and film school thesis concerns with color, etc., this is just a one trick pony movie that is mildly involving and at least different, but by no means classic."
2,Way over hyped,"Malcolm Crow is a child psycholigist, but one of his patientse kills himself and shoots Malcolm, he wants to succeed with his next one. His next child is Cole, a young boy who can see dead people. At first Malcolm doesn't believe the boy but he starts to help him out and slowly beging to believe the boy. Malcolm is also having problems with his wife, she doesn't seem to love him that much anymore. Ok, what is the deal with this movie, it's not bad but it's not great. It's no where near as good as it's made out to be nor is it scary. The ending is really predictable, I can't believe no one saw it coming. The movie has some good points, a few good sub plots involving a dead girl tring to call Cole for help. This movie would of been alot better if the plot wasn't known, but it was, Malcolm spend the first half of the movie trying to figure out what is wrong with the kid, it would of been better if we didn't know beforehand either."
3,Not bad,"This movie is good, but not as good as everyone says it is. But it's definitely worth seeing. Check it out!"
1,NOT a Psychological thriller...,"In one word: BORING. Sorry. As I watched this film for the first hour and saw it was going nowhere, I had to pick up the jacket box the film came in and saw the words ""The Most Psychological Thriller in a Long Time..."", and I began to laugh hysterically. I was really hyped up over watching this, and after reading ALL of the reviews on this site, I was really prepared for a real scary thriller. NOPE. NOT HERE. And as for the so-called really ""shocker of a final scene"". NOPE. NOT HERE. This film was not the thriller everyone says it is. And I can not recommend it for that."
3,Nothing to rave about&#65533;,"This is an unexceptional film with interesting twist at the end. But this twist was explored earlier in a brilliant French movie called ""A Pure Formality"" with Gerard Depardieu and Roman Polanski. The French film is a must see. This one is just an average movie."
5,Movie Gets 5 stars - DVD Gets 3,"There's only one thing to say about the movie -- ""See it"". To say any more is to say too much.About the DVD bonus material -- director interviews, deleted scenes, et cetera. I watched the movie once then went directly to this material, which was great. But it spoiled the second viewing. Watch this movie 2-3 times before being tempted by the bonus material. Honest. I regret not having heeded this advice.About the DVD and the preview trailers - I'd rather have paid 5 bucks extra, even 10 bucks extra to not have the preview trailers. The DVD Menu button doesn't work. The only thing that I've found that works is to use the next chapter feature so that all you see is the titles of each of the films previewed. There may be other ways to avoid it.Brilliantly constructed movie. The best and worst of DVD in the packaging."
3,"Okay, But Not THAT Great","Maybe its because I didn't see this movie until it had been out a few weeks. Everyone talked about the surprise ending. I figured out the ""surprise"" ending at the first of the movie. Also, this movie was dark and depressing. And I couldn't help thinking it was a Ghost wanna-be. Ghost was a much better movie. I read where Bruce Willis had turned down Ghost and always regretted it. I guess this was his Ghost."
4,Sixth Sense,"Finally! A movie worth watching! As long as no one has said anything about it, everyone should enjoy it. Excellent plot! Very fresh idea! I would give it 5 stars, but I don't feel it was in that elite group. 4.5 stars yes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat! My Apex DVD player was flawless with the video. If you don't see this movie, you are missing a good one. DVD is the way to go!"
5,I Actually Made It Through It!,"I don't do well seeing frightening movies in the theater but I did just fine with this one. This was a big first for me! The intelligent script, novel idea, and terrific acting by the boy, Osment, and Willis made this film a sure-fire hit. I normally do not like Bruce Willis in anything, finding him super obnoxious. However, he really shows his acting stuff here and I'll give the devil his due! There are some inconsistencies in the story that my husband, friends and I picked apart later in a coffee shop but, as a whole, it had such a great impact that I can't take off for those. A boy who sees and talks to dead people and comes to shrink Bruce Willis for help... Who would have thought it would work on the screen!"
3,Too much hype!,"First of all, I must say, I might not be giving this a fair review. Before the first time I saw it I knew the ""surprise ending"". So I was waiting to see how they exicuted that. However, from all the hype, and reviews I got, I truely did expect more. The ghosts did get a little old. I must say though, I really think Cole's play added to the movie. It kind of lifted your spirits, in this dark, semi-dull movie. I would see it though. However, don't expect too much.* I also must say that Haley Joel Osmet, for being so young, did an absolutely amazing job!"
4,Suspense,"I found this movie very enjoyable. The actors all did a great job. And the story was very good. It is best to not know the ending when going to watch this film (So I will not spoil it). Watch it and ask no one about it, you will be pleased. How else do you review a movie without giving away the surprises.One quick note is that I would not classify this as a horror film. more like a suspense. If you are looking to be scared out of your seats....this movies is not for you."
3,"Interesting, if not wholly reasonable","I'm giving this film three stars because it held my interest from start to finish and because the ending had a very good twist. Like The Usual Suspects (which is a five star movie, as good as the classics, in line for best of its genre of all time), we get a wonderful twist at the end which completely changes the entire movie's meaning, back to the beginning. But this one isn't as compelling and doesn't stand up to intelligent analysis. Let's say you are a ghost, okay? Let's say you don't know it. Do you think maybe, just maybe, you would notice that nobody else sees you? There are ghosts in this movie, and at least one of them doesn't realize that people don't even see him or her. Hello? I have to hand it to Bruce Willis - he picks good scripts. It's not that he seems like the greatest actor of all time, but when you hear that he is in a movie, you know that it will be a movie with some quality."
5,When children are wiser than adults,"This was a chilly movie of a child medium who could see dead people. Sent to a psychologist and various medical doctors, one young boy's experience is a ominous feeling of a rare ability denied, reviled, and ultimatley accepted."
1,Read this if you havent seen the movie.,"The plot was pretty weak and Bruce Willis's acting talent is nonexistant.this is a movie that would be easier if a friend seen it and gave you a 30 second summary,would sound something like ""Save your money and your time and dont bother""."
4,Sixth Sense - drama and suspense,"Bought as a gift for my son, Bruce Willis turned in a good performance in a movie that keeps you interested. I never would have seen this movie if my son hadn't asked for it and I am glad he did."
5,Great Cinematographic Language,"This is a good story with a great cinematographic language, if you are a early cinematographer or film maker studen, you will get a lot of teaches, because the director make a great movie with a good story. You would apreciated a lot of shots with a lot of meaning that make you understand the contex of the film.Try this movie and meabe you would whish make films or learn more about the movie history and language."
5,The best horror movie/movie last year,"This movie was made perfect. The acting, the story, the pull of the audience, the way it was made, the beginning, the end, it was all good. I tell you, this movie is awesome!"
5,The Best Thriller I've Seen in a Long Time,"The Sixth Sense is a movie that will grab you and pull you in, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the surprise ending that will leave you stunned and speechless. Not since the movie ""Seven"" has a surprise ending completely shocked and moved me. I had to see this movie twice; once when I was entirely unaware what was going to happen and a second time to see how the pieces truly fit. Bruce Willis, who does have a tendency to pick typecast roles, gives an excellent performance as a child psychiatrist fighting his own demons, and Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. He played perfectly a kid who was extremely frightened by what he saw, but who tried to remain strong for the sake of his mother. This movie is thrilling and frightening, and at the same time very moving, especially with the relationship between Osment and his mother. This is definitely a movie to own."
3,Never really goes anywhere....,"Okay there's the twist. One of the movie's big selling points, but apart from that and the young boy's performance, there really isn't that much to shout about. ""The sixth sense"" has potential to make you jump, it has a couple of flashes of excitment and is well directed. Unfortunately, the settings for the film are way too bland and anonymous. My biggest complaint is the fact that the movie never takes off, the beginning is promising but I was always expecting something more to happen, it just seems to spend two hours in first gear and never anymore than that. The acting and the ""twist"" is its saving grace."
4,One of the best Scary Movies Ever.,"The stroy is complicated and scary, the performances are deep and emotional, the drama is heart wrenching, it suffers from one thing, being kind of short. Although its very good it could have been like 15 mins longer, with more ghosts, the ending is a doozy. M. Night is the best scary movie director ever, can't wait for the village, i would recomend unbreakable over signs for the M. Night fan. 8 out of a 10."
1,It STINKS!,"This movie is horrible! Bruce Willis acted horrible, heck the Omega Code beat's this! This movie wasn't scary at all. After walking out at the theater, I thought to myself, ""was this a horror movie? "" I was dissapointed, with this, and still am. PLEASE don't buy this. Buying this is just a waist of money!"
3,Nothin' to write home about,"Basically, I think this is one of the most overrated movies ever made. Yeah, it has a cool ending and it's a good movie to watch, but it didn't deserve NEARLY the recognition that it recieved. If you want a dramatic movie with a twist, this is it. But if you are watching this movie for all the hype it has recieved, you will be really disapointed."
1,Received Counterfeit Version of DVD,"The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)Sold by: Amazon.com, LLCI realize the refund window of this item has expired, but I wanted you to know that it was a gift for my daughter, she finally had a chance to open and watch it, and we found the DVD to be a counterfeit - the label was an obvious counterfeit print job, and the DVD does not even work.How do you even explain or justify a counterfeit DVD being in your possession, much less selling and shipping one?We have been long time and loyal Amazon customers - w would love to see you do the honorable thing and give us a complete refund for this DVD.In the meantime, I am off to the shopping cart to try to find a genuine copy of this DVD for her.I look forward to your response and thank you for your time.Sincerely,Camille C Pratt"
4,Wow!,"The movie with the now imfamous ""I see dead people"" line is actually a really good movie. The film is filled with interesting characters and a twist ending that will leave your jaw on the floor! I also have to give credit to Donnie Wahlberg who did an excellent job as the troubled former patient of Bruce Willis. I didn't even recognize him when I watched the movie the first time.All of the actors in this film did an excellent job. This film really does deserve all of the praise it has received! Check this one out!"
1,I will not pay for this,"After 7 minutes of being forced to watch movie trailers on the DVD version, I took it back. I will neither pay or keep any DVD like this one."
5,Good deal!,"Came quickly and in good shape, as promised! Love this movie. They don't make many spooky movies that aren't also gory or just plain horrific. This is the perfect mix of suspenseful and intriguing, with only a moment or two that might make you jump just because you weren't expecting anything. Makes you look at things a little differently. I really feel for the little boy."
2,dont rent dont buy,well i thought this movie was going to be great from what i had heard but what a let down. this was a totally hyped up movie. acting was good but it lacked in interest quite a bit through the movie. although it times it sends a little shiver down your spine. but dont expect it to be anything worth renting or buying.
1,Carnival of Souls Ripoff,"When I finally saw the 'surprise twist ending' to this mess, I smacked my forehead and yelled ""OH NO!! NOT ANOTHER CARNIVAL OF SOULS RIPOFF!?!?!!!"".Geez Louise, how many times will we be subjected to the retelling of this decades-old plot?!! It sucked when it was ripped off in Jacob's Ladder, it was decent in Angel Heart (though slightly different premise) and it was ok as a Twilight Zone ""Going My Way"" episode. But overall, nobody has improved on the original, and believe me, that movie was no gem either, but for its time it was original and spooky.Here's a new tongue twister, try it at home, Sixth Sense Sucks! Say that several times, I know I do all the time."
3,Paint it Black,"bruce willie is a cHild psychologist hElping a mentally challenged little kid, a'S the film goes on we finD out more about both of thEm and lAter we know all there is to know about the traumatiseD."
2,Boring movie,"I don't know why people make so much noise about this movie. It was simply boring, with an excellent`performance by little Osmond."
1,Flawed...,"The Sixth Sense is severely flawed. First, there is no resolution. The boy presumably will continue to see (sometimes gruesomely injured) dead people. The boy says they don't know they're dead...but...umm...surely the hanged people, who are shown not screaming or anything, know...So little Cole will spend his life seeing grisly broken bodies. But hey, he knows all they want is help! The scene with the poisoned girl is underdeveloped and rushed...compared to the slow, slow pace of other stuff. The ""rules-clues"" section talks about red...sure, red is used a lot. That's about it. It's a film with lots of red. Nothing very creative or special there. There's a blooper when the wife's boss leaves her apartment and is heard saying ""See you two later""...clearly a blooper. (Caught that on repeat viewing after learning the secret ending...it obviously missed the editor). No explanation of why Cole knows a Latin phrase."
3,Hardly What I Expected,"While the hype surrounding this movie made me think it was some spectacular thriller, before I even went to see the film I figured out the secret. It was obvious to me even in the trailers. The movie was excellent in that it remained true to the old thriller noir films such as the abiance Hitchcock loved. But the honest truth if it hadn't been for the stunning performance of Haley Joel Osment as Cole... this film would not have shined. The dread you feel is for that little boy and his horrible secret of seeing dead people. The real thrill is watching a little scap of a boy tortured with his big eyes and quivering lips as your heart wrenches for him and his mother. Overall, the film was not what I expected, but Haley Joel Osment amazed and astounded me with a believable Cole."
2,"""6th Sense"" Big Failure","After not seeing the movie in at the box office I decided I would go out and check it out on video, to my suprise the movie was qite dull.. It wasnt scary, and there was no real climax, it ends you off in a very bad spot, and never really developes much of a plot. To me a scary movie is something along the lines of, The Blair Witch Project, which acctualy doesnt have a bad ending, and doesnt lead up to anything.. It got 2 stars because the acting was good.. but the movie was a disapointment and I will recomend to anybody, that its not as good as the previews sound."
3,I see bad actors.,"WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS!Bruce Willis still can't act in this movie, and Haley Joel Osment's acting was no better. ""I see dead people.""? Give me a break! Plus nearly everything about it was predictable. The fact that Bruce Willis gets shot at the begining and later that year the only person who will talk to him is the kid who can ""see dead people""? Doesn't that just shout out that your dead? Plus, if I were Bruce Willis's character, I would have figured the whole thing out when I saw my dead body on the bed! This movie was a major dissapointment (though not as big a dissapointment than Armageddon AKA the worst movie ever)."
2,Another one-trick pony,"The Sixth Sense is a decent movie to rent, but it's all hype. The movie has a few ""scary"" moments which keep you awake, but it's basically a snooze fest with one great gimmick. You have to see it to find out what the ""trick"" is, but it's purely a gimmick movie, not worth all the hoopla it's receiving."
1,This movie isn't good at all.,"it has no action, whats so scary about a kid who sees dead people? nothing ever happens when he does see them, thats the most action in the movie, thats it. He sees dead people nothing ever happens that is any where near scary."
1,Six Cents,Yeh very intriguing. The psychiatrist gets shot in the first 5 minutes. Then he appears two minutes later as Bruce Willis obviously acting as the psychiatrist. Then it's really scary. Oh no! all the kitchen cabinets are open in disarray. Not unlike mine after I prepare dinner. And the cutesy kid obviously acting as a cutsey kid. Isn't he precious? Oh OH I see dead acting. And the ending -- it should have the butler who did it --it would have been more surprising. No Sense.
4,Nicely done,While regarded as a thriller or horror film the movie left me with a different impression. Sure there are scary moments but they seem secondary to the relationship that builds between Willis and the little boy and to some extent the boy's mother. The story actually is quite simple and I was expecting something a little more intricate. That's the only reason for 1 missing star. The acting is well done throughout. One odd aspect of this DVD is the previews in the beginning. I couldn't find a way to get past this other than fast forwarding. That is slightly annoying.
4,One of 99's Best. Great Surprise Ending!,I went and saw The Sixth Sense thinking it would be another predictable thriller. Instead I was so surprised when I saw the ending I was also surprised that it wasn't a huge special effects horror film like The Haunting but still good. One of 99's best movies.
4,I Knew the Surprise Ending and I Still Loved It,"Yes, someone had the nerve to tell me how it ended before I saw it, but I won't do the same injustice here. I CAN say that I loved this movie. I had my doubts when I put this in the DVD, but it reached right out and grabbed me. For me, Bruce Willis is an acquired taste. I dislike more of his movies than I like, but in this one he is first rate. Haley Joel Osment, who I had only seen twice before(Forrest Gump and the Jeff Foxworthy Show), also gives a terrific performance and should have an Oscar sitting on his shelf. The commentary and deleted scenes added to my enjoyment. I felt like this movie could have went another forty-five minutes or an hour even, and it still would have been very enjoyable. I think kids might enjoy it too, as long as they had an adult there with them during some of the intense stuff. This film very deservedly got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and probably should have won."
5,One Great Flick!,I enjoy suspense films and this has to be one of the best! It's not only suspenseful but creepy and bazaar. What is great is nobody gives away the ending for those that haven't seen it yet! The acting is good and the storyline is great. It gets a bit slow at one point and you start wondering where it is going. Just stick with it because you are in for a treat!
5,Let's See Some Dead People,"I think master Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of this movie. ""The Sixth Sense"" is perhaps the most thrilling movie of the last decade. Director M. Night Shyamalan presents us the story of little Cole Sear (beautifully played by Haley Joel Osment), a child with an unusual -and definitely scary -ability of seeing dead people that refuse to accept they are not along the living anymore. As psychologist Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis portrays someone who goes beyond his ""Die Hard"" character. The relation between these two is the strength of this film.And I say that Hitchcock would have been proud of this movie because the twist at the end of the movie is something he would have probably made. Bravo for Mr. Shyamalan. But watch it! Don't let anybody tell you how this film ends. Enjoy."
4,VERY GOOD,This movie is a great suspense movie that has a total shocker for the ending! One of the best thriller movies I have seen in a long time!
1,Non Sense,"After all the rave reviews about this film I was amazed when I finally saw it. Slow, tedious and boring. And as for the so-called surprise ending, it has to be the most blindingly obvious one ever. I mean how many clues do you need!"
2,Bad To Decent Not Good Great,"I stand on thin ice when I criticize this film but I don't care. Bruce Willis's performance destroys the great performance of the young star Haley Joel Osment. A rediculous script is only kept afloat by a surprise ending that you'll question for days. Too many cons with too few pros make this a film worth seeing(If you have no car, one channel, and no VCR). Go rent a classic."
1,NOT AGAIN...,Rubbish from beginning to end. Thank god there's an ending. Youneed a sixth sense if you're going to watch this movie.
5,AWESOME!!,What can I say? This was such an awesome movie that had me on the edge of my seat. My kind of movie.
5,Relaxing and beautiful music,"Smirk is an upbeat, fun and mellow cd that mixes jazz and pop. As I listened I sort of fell into the lyrics and music as I closed my eyes and daydreamed. Pete Stanley mixes sounds that both soothe and relax the mind and soul. One can almost see in Peter Stanley's heart as he creates tender music."
3,"Good book, worth it for former Secret Service officer John Norris and former agent Robert Steaurt's comments","As confirmed to myself from the author, Bill Sloan, the unnamed agent at the beginning of the book who spoke with much trepidation was former Dallas office agent Robert Steaurt (I spoke to Steuart in 1992 and 1993). Although good, the best parts of the book are the aforementioned comments from Steaurt as well as the chapter on former Secret Service officer John Norris (since deceased).Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
1,Less then 1 star,"Poor poor and did I mention this book was poorly written? Never ceases to amaze me how certain new age flim flamers decide to make science prove certain things such as auras...science cant even prove relativity how could it prove auras? Im not saying Auras dont exist...Im just saying they cant be captured by a camera lens. Give me a break, anyone who has ever studied photography will know the lens is not some 4th-5th dimensional viewing that sees into the spiritual realm...if that was the case each picture we took would be full of guides and angels and devas and auras of trees and people....yet you go to these ""aura camera"" and they put you in a lower lit area...almost with a black tint or shade and they take you picture and out comes you with an aura...Con job and that pretty much sums the content of this book. Dont bother buying it unless you are masochistic."
5,gangstafied to the end,"love this lp eiht and cmw keep it ghetto and hood eiht is a legend in the rap game and if you're a fan like I been since 1990 you know what to expect frtom eiht he disses hoodrats, no good baby mama's, and yes there's the typical get high song and hustling in the hood cop this."
5,Close to Home,"Anyone who has aging parents can relate to Teddy's experience in The Fifth Season. Able and Lillian could be my parents; this could be my family. Robert Downs has written a touching portrayal of getting old and what it's like for the child to become the parent and the parent the child. Responsibilities suddenly shift and it's a painful experience for all. The Fifth Season has just the right amount of tension and humor. It makes you realize that life goes by quickly and each moment should be savored. However, it also says that even in life's most difficult season, there is much to hold onto and enjoy. Beauty never fades and love never dies. It just changes. I highly recommend this book."
5,Camo Hat,"Bought two of these hats and then went back and bought two more. Good quality and fit. Shipping was fast. I have a 8-1/8"" head and the 3XL fit correctly."
4,Perfect color and size,"I ordered these for my kids to complete their camouflage outfits. The coloring was exactly what we needed and the size M (big for them on purpose due to their ages) is perfect. I always aim to buy hats that will fit me, so that they will not think the hats are just for kids. These hats will provide them with the sun protection I want, while offering them the fun of camouflage. The hats are sturdy too, so I expect they will endure years of play and hiking."
2,Poor Workmanship,"The sewing was not done well on this hat. Also, the chin strap was sewn on with many twists in it causing it to wind up under my chin. It is very uncomfortable. The solution was to cut the strap off."
4,Great Hat,This is a great hat and I am happy with my purchase. If I could say anything bad about this hat it would be to measure your head and get the size larger. Mine was pretty tight even though my size was on the smaller end of the size that I had ordered. It has loosened up some since I've been wearing it.
1,Home travel videos pieced together,"This was not about the National Parks specifically, but was someone's travel video's pieced together. There were even videos of hummingbirds on a feeder in someone's backyard. It was amateurish in quality and not a good look at the national parks."
1,Avoid this modem,"I recently spent days attempting to install this modem. I was installing it on a new computer and even went to the trouble of re-formatting my computer and installing Windows XP again. Even on a barebones Windows XP install, with no extra, possibly conflicting software, I could not get this modem to work.Technical support was terrible as well. They did not respond to my e-mails even though they claimed they would in 3-5 business days. Also, I spent hours on hold attempting to talk to somebody and was ultimately unsuccessful.I purchased a US Robotics V.90-V.92 Internal PCI Faxmodem and had it fully functional in less than 15 minutes."
1,Worst Modem Ever: Piece of Junk,"Once installed on a Windows XP computer, it would not connect most of the time, but worse of all it caused interference with my PCI video card. After installation of the modem I received scrambled color output to my monitor that resulted in a green streak down both sides and a red streak across the top. If it did connect, the modem on hold feature could not be disabled (my ISP does not support this feature). All incoming calls would drop all ISP connections. I would not recommend this product to anyone even if you paid me $50.00."
2,Doesn't actually fit 4Runners,"I bought this to go on my 1997 4Runner. Amazon said it would fit, but it absolutely doesn't. You can't even use the cartridge from this one on the OEM blades, I ended up trashing it as the return postage is almost as much as the wiper. The only option for the 4Runner is to buy the Toyota blade or use a refill, the adapters don't even fit properly. The wiper is also not terribly well made, and I would not buy this product again even if it did fit my 4Runner. The Bosch Icon is only a bit more money, and it is a MUCH nicer build quality."
3,"A good performing, affordable blade, but the plastic clip breaks easy.","I don't like the plastic swivel anchors they use in wiper blades nowadays. If you bump them with an ice-scraper, or let the wiper snap back onto the windshield too hard, it breaks the reatiner clip. Then, when you really need your wipers the most, it comes loose from the wiper arm. In my case, the metal wiper arm ran a big scratch across my windshield. Now, I look for all-metal blade bodies."
2,They look way better than they work,"I do a lot of highway driving here in New England, and snow, slush, & freezing rain (not to mention road salt) make seeing where you're going tough. Unfortunately, these wiper blades seem to loose their flexability as soon as the temps drop below the mid-20's, at which point they seem to miss wiping about half of the area they are supposed to be keeping clean. I drive a Toyota FJ Cruiser, which has one of the flattest windshields on the road, so it is not a matter of extreme curvature of the windshield - I think that the rubber covering of these blade just stiffens up way too much at what I'd consider a ""normal"" winter temperature."
3,Not the right size,"I have a 2011 Rogue. Amazon ""Part Finder"" said this Anco 13"" wiper blade fit my car. My car actually uses a 14"" wiper blade. It is not a big deal but not a right size."
2,Book doesn't help you pass the exam,"This book presents a very luxurious and impractical software development methodology. No software project, no matter how large, could possibly follow their advice with any degree of fidelity. The book is very fluffy, repetitive, and inefficient, and it says almost nothing about .NET. It is basically a feel-good grab bag of techniques. Don't spend [money]on this book.The book had very little connection to the actual exam. The exam was a set of scenarios with questions afterward. The questions weren't that difficult, but many of the scenarios were too fuzzy, or the questions had fuzzy answers, with a ""choose all that apply"" format. This was not an objective test. Passing is largely a matter of luck. The predecessor to this exam (70-100) was much more objective.And of course, Microsoft doesn't tell you your score at the end, only whether you pass, so you don't know how much more studying you have to do for next time. ..."
2,Excellent study book only not for this exam,"This book's content is about 95% Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF), though the exam, which I wrote and passed, is about 5% MSF. This book is excellent if you want to write the MSF Practioner exam (74-100) because it covers the material for that exam really well albeit with material that is taken almost verbatim from the free downloadable MSF resource whitepapers at http://www.microsoft.com/msf.I would not recommend buying this book for 70-300 and would suggest that you can probably get by on 74-100 with material you can get for free, if you are interested in writing that.I didn't read any other books but I found the practice exam available from http://selftest.kaplanit.com to be extremely useful."
2,Well at least the book now saves you 15% on the exam,"Unfortunately, this is the weakest book in the MCSD series. I was not able to even finish this book. Fortunately ExamCram2 has an awesome book which is much better, shorter, and less expensive."
1,Go get another book if you want to pass the exam,This book gets one star because it does not cover the material required to pass the exam. I would have almost failed the exam had I used just this book for my preparation. Luckiliy I have used online questions from one of the web-sited listed on Microsoft's web-site and that helped me to pass the exam.The exam contains mainly case studies and this book gives only one of them from start to finish. The exam is mainly a comprehension sort of exam where you read the passage and answer the questions. So get a book that have those case-studies.
1,Buyer Beware!,"This is NOT a karaoke disc!!!You know those awful versions of songs contained on karaoke discs known as the ""vocal demo versions""? This is a disc full of just those, without the ""not original artist"" vocals being removable.I really can't imagine what anyone would want this. Especially considering that all of the original versions of the songs by the original artists can be found on in inexpensive compilation CDs."
5,GREAT BOOK,My Dad bought this for me for my birthday and it has loads of information on my family and I love it.
4,My favorite driving music,"When a techno aficanado friend of mine gave made me a tape of this cd, she warned me about it being ambient and minimal for my tastes...but I found it just the opposite. In fact, I found these true deep tech-house tracks to be the perfect blend of those elements. The instrumentation is so dead on...the jazzy tracks are just brassy enough for the deep rolling sophistication of the entire CD. I am really quite impressed. There is one track on the compilation on which I wish the vocals (which in every other track take an appropriate backseat or disapear entirely) would just go away, but other than that, Cochois (The Timewriter) has really done a fine job. I would definitly recommend this CD for anyone interested in a nice chilled back ride home from work or play."
5,Strongly agree with Groovemantis - this is one of the best,Strongly agree with Groovemantis - this is one of the best house albums out there. prototype for where house should go.
4,jigsaw pieces: the wheat has been separated from the chaff,"In Jigsaw Pieces, composer Jean Cochois (aka Timewriter) explores the world where house music ceases being an experment in hard driving rhythms and take on an organic, sensous and fufilling experience that is as stirring as it is fufilling. the first track, Travelouge, though incongruous to the rest of the cd, is a slow orchestral piece which is almost sure to take you to a bittersweet memory, but the rest of the cd is nothing but pure bliss that one can either gyrate to with the right partner, or it can be used to simply float between worlds. Jigsaw Pieces is uplifting, positive, organic and sensuous. In my opinion, it sets the standard for other electronica artists to aspire to."
4,A house album for techno lovers,"What a great piece of work from the Timewriter! This is a very calm house album, that will satisfy techno fans as well. Not to much of the usual house kitsch. The sound is very clean and tight. I reserve the title 'genious' to very few artists, but the timewriter gets close.+g"
1,Not worth it,"This is a total waste. Unless your station is super strong, consistent and near the lower numbers, don't buy this product. Tuning is done by starting at the lower numbers then, when the button is pressed, or the signal strength varies, it skips to the next strongest frequency. If your station is in the higher numbers, it takes a while to get there and then it may not stay there."
3,Not that great.,"I got this item to use at work.. but inside my work building, i get only one channel in and i have to put it a certain way b4 i can even get that channel."
1,Pacific Image PF3600Pro,I purchased this scanner (PF3600Pro) because it offered a lot of bang for the buck. With 3600 DPI and a DMAX of 3.6 it seemed like a really great scanner for under $. Well my experience with this scanner is not so great.My original scanner was sent back to Pacific Image for replacement because it was loud and had trouble scanning film. Plus it was scratching the film. You could see scan lines at 3600 DPI.The replacement just ate one of my strips of negatives and is also has a problem seeing scan lines at 3600 DPI. So now I wait for my second RMA.It has the option of feeding strips up to 40 exposure of 35mm film or single slides. Forget the slides. It's a lousy slide scanner. Scans are way too dark.My suggestion is to get a Nikon Coolscan IV or 4000. They cost about $ and $ respectively.
1,DO NOT ORDER 9700 PRO!!!!!!!,"Same as reviews below, I didn't see them before I ordered, I haven't got my card yet... I WILL GET A FULL REFUND... :) False advertising doesn't pay!!!!!!!"
3,alot of information,"Umm all I can say is “it very hard to get into"", it a very good guide but not for everyone"
2,"A fair intro, but not very detailed and lacks organisation.","I was happy when I found this book and read the introduction. After reading the book however, my appetite is not sastisfied. While there is some good material in the book, it seems somewhat poorly organized. The author obvioulsy knows her stuff, but had somewhat of a hard time to put it on paper."
1,Exactly what you want it to be....,"So here I am. I feel a little silly because my prior crystal ball attempts proved uneventful. Had I only ordered this book first. I didn't have enough scrilla left over to buy a second ball (my first had a bad collision with my wall after hours of uneventful gazing, so I substituted a wad of broken beer bottles that I wrapped in cellophane. Well after I performed the desired chants and had my girlfriend sacrifice a mouse, I managed to open the doors to the next realm. At first it was a little hazy, but with enough faith I finally was able to conjure up the proper image. It was a picture of several people. They were all in front of computers with their wallets out, typing in the magical sixteen digit numbers they possessed as directed by the amazon gods. Suddenly the image faded and took on the form of some fat cats laughing their heads off as they got rich selling crystal ball books to a bunch of suckers. Good luck with all your future endeavors!"
5,Crystal Ball Gazing -- Excellent Resource Book,"The Author of this book is great! Very informative, breaks Crystal Ball Gazing down to the basics, and also an excellent resourceful book for those that are interested in this field. Thanks!"
5,Thorough coverage,Nettler's Atlas of the Human Body made an excellent reference for any question that might be raised concerning the human anatomy.
5,Awesome,I was extremely pleased with the timely delivery and with the condition of the book. It was definitely new condition at a used price.Very happy
4,Skechers Mary Janes,"These are comfortable shoes and they fit, unlike the last pair I bought online. Sketchers doesn't pay for return shipping so I was leary of giving them another try. This time it paid off. My complaint is they are synthetic materials. This company has become too big and is now cutting corners. Too bad because I love the original pair I bought last year and wish I could have stocked up on that shoe."
4,be free of cheese shops!!,"Although browsing through the cheese shop can be a fun and satisfying experience, it can also be a costly one! ""The complete dairy foods cookbook"" will give you the A-B-Cs on how to make your own soft cheeses as well as other dairy oriented dish. A must for all those seriously self-sufficient cooks."
1,unhappy,This was shown as English. The album arrived and it was all in Spanish. Not Happy at all with this.
5,Get trim and thin!,"Ripped System-NxCare 21 Day Fat-Loss System, 1ct : NXcare is a system I have put trust in for the past 3 years. I also recommend MASS CYCLE 21 DAY SYSTEM.

3,.,"don't get me wrong this is a great series, its just that this particular collection is very small compared to the originals, meaning that the beauty of the artwork in here is not given its full glory. Its a good buy, but the size doesn't give the artists work justice. I'm still happy overall with the collection, just wish i woulda known..."
4,"Story is great, but...","...my one and only complaint is the size. The story and art is 100%, but I would have loved a bigger version. If it were bigger? 5 stars."
5,crazy,im from the united kingdom and while visiting the united states last year i heard k-ci and jojos crazy for the first time. it is a fantastic song and i still absoloutely love it.
2,not good for those with nut allergies,"This book looked very promising at first look. There are so many recipies, and when it arrived I was so excited at the possililty of preparing and cooking so many different foods. I soon found however that alot of the baking and recipes involved using pecans and other nuts and seeds as replacements for thickeners and flour. This was very dissapointing considering I am allergic to all nuts and legumes and large seeds. I found it surprizing too, since allergies to nut and legumes (peanuts are included in the legumes category) are very common. Since I don't eat dairy as well, I was looking for a book that had recipies I could use. I was dissapointed."
2,"It was a joke gift, but......",I was told by the recipient that the duck does NOT float. It was supposed to be a fun toy for a new spa. I see by some other reviews that this is a common problem. I am not pleased.
3,It doesn't squeek or squirt!!!,"It's a nice lookin' duck, but I was assuming it would squeek and squirt water. I actually got it for my boyfriend who is way too big for the bathtub. He wanted a huge rubber duck to wash his hair with.Upon opening his gift we instantly realized it doesn't have a hole in it!!!Anyways, we're about to drill a hole in it. I'll let you know how that goes. No i wont."
1,This duck will leave you,"Buyers Beware!This duck will abandon you when you need him most. He looks innocent and fun; you might feel compelled to share secrets with him, but he will turn on you. He will steal your identity, and use your money to buy saltine crackers. He once convinced a flock of mallards to fly North for the winter...they landed in the parking lot of a French Restaurant, and were never heard from again."
4,My Girlfriend stole it...,"A rather large rubber duckie, this one is large enough that to treat as a stuffed animal (though definitly not as soft). It has become the center piece of my Bathroom decorated in ducks. It did stand up to several days of rough housing by my future niece and came away with no significant damage (unlike what I expected). Size wise its the right size for a ""normal sized"" person to have in the tub and feel like a kid again (now we just need tubs the right size)."
1,Crappy Design for a rubber duck!,"This ""ducky"" is designed without a flat bottom...it only floats on its side! Surely you would think they test one before selling it."
5,Big Rubber Bath Duck,"Bought this as a present for my friend, she LOVED it! and its really nice quality and the size of it is the best part. If you wanna out do a regular rubber duck this is definetly the one to get!"
4,Great Overall,"I am quite pleased w/this product. It was simple to construct, looks wonderful, & fits well w/my goth decor. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because there was a huge white product sticker on the back/right post which is turning out to be a royal pain to remove. I'll never understand why sellers do that to products ... NEVER."
2,Cheesy,This stuff is workable but cheesy up next to the apple products. XM needs to focus on producing some higher quality hardware products that are truely better than anything else.
4,Resetting is annoying,"It freezes up often for no reason, and yes I did update the software. Fortunately resetting is simple, press and hold the power button and up volume button at the same time. This is really the only complaint I have."
5,Skyfi3 Car Kit,"This is the 3rd kit I have purchased. I can now move my Skyfi3 from house, to car, to trailer, to bike and get full use of my subscription to XM satellite radio. These kits are great but hard to find."
4,A great insite into the joys of throwing boomerangs.,"Beside Booga being a fun book to read, it is the first novel I've ever seen that showed how fun and rewarding throwing boomerangs is. I've been throwing boomerangs for several decades and Hayes Brown really caught the spirit of the sport. There are some wonderful lines in the book on throwing. ""To throw a boomerang is to play a game with the wind."" and ""We give a boomerang energy. Wind gives it lift. Wood gives it spirit."" are just a couple of examples. Protagonist Boo Rasmuson goes on a high spirited counter culture cross country road trip to compete with his boomerangs. Join him and you'll enjoy the ride."
2,"If you loved the original Deathstalker series, then leave this series alone!!","DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU ENJOYED THE ENDING TO THE ORIGINAL SERIES!! It will ruin it for you, the same way that it ruined it for me at the ""end"" of this series...trust me!I loved the original Deathstalker series and had a hard time reading this series, as it feels like a regurgitated cast and story to the original series, but without the connection to the cast that the original had. Could the cast be anymore cookie cutter to the original cast? It's utterly disappointing in comparison to the original series. If you haven't read the original series, then this might not be too bad, but if you haven't read the original series, then do yourself a favor and go read it.I wish I had never read this novel or this series because of the dark taint that it put on the original series, but I can't erase it from my mind unfortunately."
2,Not Good,"Simon R. Green is a great storyteller, but the plot in this book stinks. Suspension of dis-belief is one thing, but this is farcical. Finn knows all, does what he wants. Everyone is too stupid to stop him. He juggles all the enemies of the empire under his control.....knowing exactly who to suborn and how.One man's hurt feelings destroys an empire by him practically snapping his fingers. Please!This book is meant to set up a new Deathstalker Trilogy. I will read the 2nd volume, but hopefully won't have to skim through a third of the book like I was forced to do with this one.Buy it used from Amazon!"
4,Nice Item For Pokemon Fans,I bought this for my 8 year old who is a pokemon fan. He loves sitting with the book and some paper and trying to draw the characters on his own. It's a nice break from video games.
1,Cheap book,I thought this book would be more than a mere comic sized book. It has 32 pages in it. I have seen comic books and coloring books with more pages. It was not worth $16 plus shipping but then again maybe my Grand-Daughter who loves Pokemon will love it. I personally do not think it is all that great for the price.
3,Ok book - But not for the price.,I ordered this book for my son for Christmas. When I received the book I was a little surprised at the quality compaired to the price I paid. I must say that it did arrive in a timely fashion and was in the same condition that was described but the original price was $4.99 and I paid almost three times the cost of that. I always shop on line to get competative prices and for things I have a hard time ordering locally but this time it was not in my favor. I guess you win some and you loose some.
5,Great Buy!!,"Thanks book in fab condition. Great book, love it and am glad to be taking the course to use it"
2,Very Unhappy,"I knew within the first few seconds that this ring would be going back. I've been looking for an inexpensive band with a row of sapphire-like stones in the middle and a row of diamond-like stones both sides and I was hoping this would be it but it wasn't. This looks cheap. What was truly surprising is that they got the CZ to look so authentic but the ""sapphires"" looked like beads. This ring looks like a novelty ring. Certainly not worth the price!"
1,I told the real truth about those so called demons C. W.,"Hi I wrote the answer and the truth about your so called demons ""Drag Queen""s didn't search Eddie out for fun it was the other way around Look for In The Closet With Eddie By CANDACE WATKINS"
1,This Book is a waste of time. Juvenile.,"This book was entirely a waste of time. Sanello's account of Murphy was shallow to uninteresting. Sanello even mis-quoted jokes at times. The book was empty, and barely had enough fresh information on Murphy to fill a magazine article.The author also failed to effectively use metephores to illustrate his point. Rather, his analogies were clumsy and unremarkable.Save yourself some time and rent Murphy's movie Boomerang instead."
2,Not a great product,This spatula has a wooden handle which is really rough and hurts hands. Also the handle is rather short and this makes it very hard to use this spatula. Buy KitchenAid Silicone Spatula Scraper instead.
4,Add another Mens book for Pagans to the list,"In today's world when I am asked Do you know of a good book to give to men to read who are seeking pagan,wiccan,Isian training? I tell them to start here and work there way around. Isaac is a wonderful writer and can help to clarify a few things for us guys who need it. More men are returning to the Goddess and this is one book they should add to there personal libraries."
3,Had the aura of a personal attack,"I made it a little more than 30 pages into the book and stopped after reading criticisms of people's ""thinking patterns,"" and the words ""grouchy"" and ""dysfunctional biases"" to describe Reconstructionist religions. There is an obvious partiality towards eclectic and unreasoned New Age reinterpretations of ancient religions over actual revivals. Three stars (instead of one) because I did not finish it."
5,A++,My textbook was better than described and i appreaciate the saving of buying this older edition rather than the newer one.
5,Comprehensive and interesting,This is a must-read text for anyone interested in a general overview of ecology. The chapters are thorough yet concise and the topics are laid out in a logical progression.
1,It better be revolutionary for $120,"I've never even heard of Mr. Robert Leo Smith. Is he a Nobel prize winner? The world's most renowned ecologist? What is so special about this book that it can justify a whopping $120 price tag? It's no secret college textbook authors reap from a captive market in students who are forced to buy texts for required reading, but this takes the cake. And it will lead me to find other courses that don't require a student's entire paycheck to unearth the secrets."
2,Just Okay,"I took advantage of a free rebate to get this product & am actually glad it didn't cost me any money! I had been using the Venus razor and was quite happy with it. This is just like the Venus, except it vibrates. I didn't feel like the shave I got on my legs or underarms was any better with this than my old Venus."
1,Not long term,"It's good paper for ""THAT DAY""This is not for long term use. You will see that after the very first wash. Matter of fact, there aren't ANY heat transfer paper that you can use for long term use. If the first wash doesn't show you, definitely the second will.Go vinyl or silk screen, for long term.Go Heat Transfer Paper for short."
3,HP Iron-On,Product easy to use. Held up in wash. Only problem was ordered 3 packages. Two of the 3 did NOT contain 12 sheets. They only had 11. Needed 34 sheets so luckily between 3 packages had enough. ORDER EXTRA when purchasing.
1,Transfer Transfer,"I chose to purchase HP iron-ons due to having an HP printer and the reputation of the HP product lines. However, I was not happy with the performance of the HP iron-on. It was not as smooth a lift from the paper onto desired material item. Nor was there a completely clean transfer, again due to inadequate lift from the paper. This was unsatisfactory in the results I aquired, and less than adequate, based upon my experienced with other iron-on clothing transfer product lines (such as Avery)--I am sorry to report. Using Avery has always been consistently successful.6-sheet 8.5x11 Letter T-shirt TransfersHP C6049A Iron-on Transfers"
3,Okay for 1 use,"These printed nicely and ironed on nicer than other iron on papers I've tried in the past. But, when the shirts were washed, the pictures I ironed on cracked."
1,What a joke,"I bought these because I have an HP printer and figured they would be best for the shirts I want to make. I couldn't get them to take for anything in the world. I put the pressure on it, ironed them longer, everything you can think of and they still wouldn't take. Then when I finally got one to take it completely cracked and crumbled and started peeling off before an hour was up. It never made it to the wash, so now I am out the money I paid for them and still have no shirts. Any other brands you suggest instead?"
1,Don't even bother...,"They're easy to use & they look great right up until you wash them the first time. Light t-shirt transfers crack & peel something awful, I've never known one to last more than one wearing.If you're going to make a t-shirt, get the kind that says DARK t-shirt transfers. I've got a closet full of Office Depot & Avery brand Dark t-shirt transfers (many transfered onto white shirts) that look great and I wear them every weekend. It costs a little more, but they actually work, making it well worth the money."
1,HP Iron-On transfers,"I tried the iron-on transfer paper in my HP Deskjet 970 printer. I ironed my design onto a 50/50 cotton T-shirt. It says you can machine wash these iron-ons, but when I did so, the iron-on design fell to pieces in my washing machine. It was a major mess to clean up my machine...And yes, I did wash it in cold water as instructed..."
4,t-shirt transfers,"I've used both H-P and Office Depot transfers, & been happy with both. Both went on easily & did not peel off in washing, although there was some fading after a number of months. This may have been avoided with more careful laundering. I liked the Office Depot somewhat better--but both were satisfactory. I have to say that the Avery dark t-shirt transfers are ones I would never use again because not only did the black ink in my Epson printer bleed with the Avery transfers, but the two times I attempted to used them, my printer stopped printing in black and caused me no end of trouble. I would be wary of the Avery. I plan to stick to the two brands I've had luck with."
1,Worthless product,I used this product for a fabric christmas present. I followed the directions to the T and my project looked great until I washed it. The photos started to crack and started peeling off of my project. I used the correct fabric and waited 24hrs before washing etc. I did this twice and got the same results. I will never buy this product again! What a waste of money and alot of my time!
2,Watch Out On White,"I've done this a number of times... making ""Big Brother"" or ""Baby"" t-shirts. When using the HP paper, the white transfer backing stands out substantially against the white of the t-shirt. The end effect is that of a 1970's ""patch"".I had better luck when the paper had to be ""reversed"" and then transferred onto the t-shirt."
2,Didn't really work.,"I got these to make t-shirts for an event. It's a good thing a friend had backup, because, even after following directions, mine didn't work. I printed and gave one to another friend and his t-shirt came out very ""so-so."""
3,didn't work as well as i wanted.,"it has really opaque colors, i just lost my t-shirts because of that paper :( after washing it was a mess."
2,Waste of Time,We've used three iron-ons. The first two faded and cracked after only a couple of washings and the third one did not transfer well at all. We're planning to throw the rest away and start with another brand of paper.
1,"It sure does stick, gotta give it that.","It sticks well to the fabric AND really well to its backing paper. The only way I can get the backing paper off the fabric is to alternate peeling small strips off with scrubbing with a soaking wet cloth. Nothing else gets it loose. And the end result is ugly and STILL has a layer of paper scraps over it. ""Peel off"" - no WAY. I can't even peel two inches off.What a piece of garbage. The Avery dark transfers go on beautifully and stay on beautifully too. I'll take that over something that won't even let go of its paper any day - the rest of these (after three attempts - I should have quit while I was ahead!) go in the trash, where they belong."
1,Waste of money,"These iron on transfers are terrible. I've used the avery brand and have had great results. This time I went for the cheaper HP brand and have already wasted 4 sheets trying to iron something on. I'm following the directions and have experience using iron ons in the past, and these are a waste of money!"
5,Easy to follow!,"This book is excellent! The author shows you step by step what you need to do to reupholster your piece of furniture. I used this book and was able to quickly learn what I needed to do to reupholster an old chair I own and looked like I bought a new chair from the store when I was finished. Since then, I have had family and friends asking me where I bought the ""new chair!"" I recommend this book to anyone wishing to do the same."
3,Not as expected,"In covering my ottoman, I found this book was not enough detail. Many steps were omitted that the author seem to take for granted or didn't seem to think important.Wouldn't buy again."
3,"Good ""tailoring"" Book","I wanted a book to show me tips on how to use the ""tools."" What I got was a book on fabric tailoring. Now that's OK for folks who really want to get serious about upholstering. I just wanted to fix my dinning room chairs and two other arm chairs that were sagging in the middle of the seat. This book is about 33 years old. The staple gun they use is a hand stapler. They fasten seat webbing with tacks. They cut foam rubber with a hand saw. Utube says you can use an electric carving knife. Today, they use pneumatic staple guns for sure quick fastening of fabric and webbing. I bought one from Amazon for under $25 and it works great. I watched Utube videos to see how to use it. I fixed 7 chairs and my wife says they all look and feel great. I should have just stuck to Utube for instructions."
3,Reupholstering at Home,"I have been thinking of redoing my couch, chair and ottoman. This book gives the details I will need. It is currently Italian leather, but I will use some of the new softer materials."
4,confused,so i didnt get what it shows in the picture but the product i got is really good and still use it to this day
1,Cheap Garbage,This product is terrible. Save your money and buy the little foam nail files / polishers. The instructions were followed exactly and rendered pitiful results.
4,A Helpful guide to the Text,"I originally got this to help me to further understand the text of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson. It is not necessarily for just a classroom scene and after reading through notes and such, I discovered more symbolism in the text and many references I would have otherwised overlooked.Using the Study Guide and re-reading the novella of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I now have a broader understanding of the messages Stevenson is trying to get across in his book.A VERY, very helpful text to have beside your copy of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde!"
2,It broke,Ok so I loved this lock at first. Was just what I was searching for... until it died! Yes the keypad comes with keys.. but my fault for not knowing where I put them!! The keypad was only a few months old. Apparently the keypad's second vertical row died for no apparent reason and my combination included some of those numbers (2)... So keep those keys handy so you dont get locked out like I did!
4,"Good lock, cheaper than home depot options","My only complaint is that the action is a little loud, but all similar locks I tried were also similarly loud. It was easy to install, and seems to be decent quality."
3,"Nice, but be warned.","I'm a huge fan of Mr. Batali. So after pining over a Le Creuset Dutch Oven for the past year and finally getting ready to take the plunge, I was amazed when I learned about the Batali line and their less than half price tag.However, the ""you get what you pay for warning"" might apply here.The Batali people confirmed what I feared. The product is made in China.It looks like a very nice pot, but I think I'll stick with the proven Le Creuset brand.Joey"
3,Stains easily,"The first pot I bought arrived with cracked enamel. Amazon speedily replaced that pot with another. The trouble is, the white enamel on both the first pot and the second stained severely after just two rather ordinary uses -- e.g. preparing a vegatable stock. Soaking for hours in a bleach solution does remove most of the stain, but I don't look forward to repeating that procedure after every second or third use."
2,"Seconds, anyone?","I am so disappointed in the enamel finish on this pot. It looks like a factory second. There are three small pits in the white finish on the inside bottom of the pot that collect cooking debris and make cleaning difficult. The outside finish is irregular and bumpy looking and the top edge of the pot has some irregularities. I would send this back, but have gotten rid of the box. I wish I had spent the extra money for the Le Cruset."
2,Not Thrilled,"I purchased this pot and was initially excited about the heaviness of it and the low price compared to Le Creuset.The first time I used the pot, it stained on the inside. All I did was cook potatoes and I ended up with a yellow cast on the inside up to the level of the water.I have never had an issue like this with my Le Creuset. I realize pots and pans are going to eventually start showing signs of use, but I don't expect it to happen the first time out.Very disappointing."
3,A Heavyweight!,"Well made, but oh so heavy to lift, especially from stove to oven and back. Not sure I will make that much use of it because it's so darned cumbersome and awkward. Afraid I might drop it."
2,pitted enamel finish,"Great pan, poor quality enamel. Returned item because it was pitted and ordered a different one at Bed Bath and Beyond (for half the price)."
5,nekekark,"This dutch oven was purchased as a gift. It was highly successful. Both gift-giver and recipient were pleased. Braised shortribs were prepared shortly thereafter, adding further pleasure.The product came as described with no imperfections. Packaging was quite adequate."
5,Mario knows his stuff,Just received and used the M.Batali 6-quart essentials pot.This is a fine piece of cookware! Our coq-a-vin was just perfect. The pot cleaned easily and looked very professional and well built. No need to buy the expensive French brand.
4,Hot pot!,"While I am more than happy with the pot itself (heavy cast-iron, nice big handles, purty color), I don't think it's too much to ask a manufacturer to produce cookware with heat-resistant parts. The lid has a metal handle. Metal, as we all eventually find out to our dismay, can be a fantastic conductor of heat. This is the case with Mario's pot.Using a material that doesn't produce second-degree burns should be a no-brainer."
3,Did not keep it...,"After seeing this pot, I liked that it was 6 qt. and seemed very comparable to the Le Creuset. However, when I recieved the item, it had 2 small but noticable dents in the lid and the metal lid handle was bent slightly to one side. This may be bad luck or they commonly send out B-stock hoping people won't notice. I ordered it straight from Amazon.The weight was another big issue - the Mario iron is considerably thicker than my 7.25 qt le creuset, making them weigh about the same.I gave it 3 stars because Amazon was very speedy with sending a new one before I returned the damaged one and paid shipping both ways."
1,Mario Batali Dutch Oven,"Mario Batali 6-Quart Italian Enamel on Cast Iron Essentials Pot, Persimmon]]. When I received this dutch oven I understood it was refurbished. When I received this item it was without any blemishes. I have used it twice. The enamel is coming off inside the pot. Four or five places in the pot and two in the lid. I will not order anymore refurbished products."
5,Mario's Enameled Pot,"Excellent value. A fraction of the price of a LeCrusett, but just as functional. Very well made. The pot is balanced with no irregular casting under the enamel. This has become a favorite utensil for making soup, sauces, etc. Maintains heat at low setting and is easy to clean. I definitely recommend this item."
2,Received in poor condition,"I purchased this and had to return it. The edge of the lid had flaws in the casting, basically it had no edge in two places, also on the pot there was a spot about the size of a sesame seed that was a pit showing bare cast iron beneath it. This purchase looked like a factory second. I suggest getting a 20% off coupon from Bed and Bath and buying the Emeril trinity 6 qt cast iron enamel in dark blue, it resembles the blue sold by Staub, with the coupon it cost me $[...] bucks, good deal, excellent dutch oven! And you can see what your getting."
4,Can't beat it for the money,"I've been drolling over a LeCrueset for ages, but never could rally the money for the expense. Too many priorities, but when Mario's Dutch oven came out I was drawn to the color. Now, the color isn't everything, and usely I don't like to purchase products put out by celeberity chefs, but I read a few reviews online and my fav. magazine did an article on it. The reviews were positve, but of course didn't compare to LeCrueset. I decided to buy it a few days later, and I haven't been sorry. For one, I finally have a Dutch Oven, and second it cooks perfectly. The only complaint I have is the lid isn't as snug as I would like, and I knew this might be a problem going into the purchase since the magazine article tagged it as its down fall. Cooked a brilliant Shepard's Pie."
3,not so beautiful,"The persimmon Batalli arrived and it looks like it will cook up a storm. Unfortunately, the enameling is inferior quality with large areas on the outside of pot that appear to have been enameled more than once. The pot appears to be a ""second"" or ""irregular"". I own two often-used Le Creusets. You pay twice as much for a Le Creuset, but you get what you pay for: a perfect looking, perfect cooking and long wearing pot. Too bad, because the Batali could have been a stunner."
4,Lens adapter,"Excellent product with fast delivery. Arrived in perfect condition. Unfortunately the length of the adapter casts a shadow on the subject when the flash occurs. To avoid the shadow, provide enough light to prevent the flash or use fill and key lighting to soften the flash shadow or disable the flash and take your chances."
3,Sophmoric,Simple straightforward good advice. Small sample base but still helpful.Aimed at younger audience. More of a how to than in depth analysis. Too general in scope. Covers a lot of ground-maybe too broad. Good place to start but real help requires more depth.
3,a semi-excellent read,this book was somewhat rather good. i may or may not read it again. but you should buy it. or not.
2,Yeast,"This gave me a yeast infection, not sure if that is supposed to happen. I stopped taking it. I didnt see any other results so I would not try it again."
1,Doesn't work for everyone,I was excited about this product since it has some of the higher reviews for Candida sufferers. I've been seeing a doctor for this issue for a few months now and we're trying different things. Candex did not work at all for me and actually made my digestion worse. It took about 2 weeks to confirm that it was the Candex and not something else in my diet. Everything returned to normal once I stopped using it for over a week. The supplier did not allow me to return it since I opened it. So now I'm stuck with a 3/4 full bottle of this product and may just end up throwing it away.
1,Difficult to take,"I can't tell if this product was effective in killing yeast, but I found it difficult to take. The directions say to take it at night at least two-hours after your last meal and an hour before breakfast with 8oz of water. Neither of these times are very convenient and the full glass of water at bedtime caused me to wake several times to urinate. I also was sensitive to one or more of the ingredients since I started feeling bad immediately after taking it. It may work just fine but I can't seem to take it without problems."
4,Works well,"My sister did a lot of research before we bought Candex, and I have no regrets. It works really well. I try to follow the no sugar diet along with it but in my country there is so much sweet fresh fruit its nearly impossible, so I try to eat less of the really sweet fruits. However I had to go without Candex for more than a month and I did fine. Once I started again I went to two capsules instead of four after only a week. It is as good as they say."
1,Careful: you can be allergic to candex,"I took my first dose in the morning-1 capsule on an empty stomach as directed. Two hours later began feeling nauseous and shortly after violently ill, throwing up. This was an awful experience. If you feel sick with this product discontinue use. Quick research revealed some people are allergic to digestive enzymes. Candex even says so on their website. But no mention on their bottle. If you read these posts or google candex/vomiting you will find that a small minority of users cannot tolerate this product. So use common sense, never start with more than one capsule, listen to your body and if you feel don't delude yourself into thinking its a healing crisis and something good is happening. Getting extremely sick shortly after taking a medication or supplement is a negative allergic reaction."
2,Made me have a stomach ache.,"I'm one of those unlucky ones that got a stomach ache from taking Candex. I followed the instructions exactly, and with in 1 hour of taking my first dose, my stomach started to feel sick and wasn't able to eat dinner because my stomach felt so lousy. I also got bad cramps and went to the bathroom a few times times. I drank about two bottles of water to try and rinse it through my system, after a short nap and about 4 hours later I feel the effects seem to be mostly gone.. I hope.Now maybe they should have a warning on the bottle to start with a lesser dosage or something, I am afraid to touch the stuff now.It might be a good product, but some of us just are very sensitive or it doesn't work with out system."
1,1 star for 3 weeks of use,Unfortunately I had to give this 1 star for 3 weeks of use with no sign of feeling better. I will adjust review in a few weeks if warranted.
1,Great... if you like food poisoning!,"I went through an entire bottle of this stuff.. and it worked. Not great, but it helped me keep my candida in check. When I reordered it a couple months later, I reacted with violent stomach pains, vomiting and diarrhea. I don't know if the product was tainted, or if my body just decided that it didn't want any more of this stuff... either way, there should be a warning on the label! Sad, because I really need a candida solution, and I will never use this one again."
1,Incorrectly labeled,This product does not contain 120 caps. You can only order 40 caps for this price. This is incorrectly labeled and very MISLEADING!!!!
4,Can have backlash--Which is positive!,"I have yet to get full benefit from this product....after several days of using it I became very ill. BUT--having educated myself about systemic infections because I have Lyme Disease, I recognize this as a ""Herxheimer reaction"" -- a phenomenon where a treatment helps briefly, then you actually get worse--it is because you are killing off *so much* toxic yeast in your body, it is overwhelmed. the ""herx"" and I are old buddies now.....SO for those who experience mysterious horrid symptoms a while after taking it---it most likely means it is working! (But disclaimer: please do check with your doc just in case, I am not a doctor, just informed of this common reaction). The answer is: taper back a bit on the candex, and detox your body every day--infrared saunas, epsom salt/hydrogen peroxide baths (pulls toxins out of your pores) mud wraps to name a few..you have to get rid of toxins as fast as you are killing off the candida...and any other crittters in there!"
5,So that's what that Scot was saying.,"Quality hardbound book essential for any Tull fan. Lyrics for the audibly challenged to help us understand what that leapin' lemur of a musician was singing and snarling all these years. If you were a fan, this book can resurrect your latent Tull spirit. Book even covers his ""warty rejects"". Get a fill-up of Tull fuel and drive Baker Street enlightened."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was a little disappointed when I received this book. I think it is over priced. We have a 14 month old and she could not remove the snaps, I had a hard time trying to remove them also. The only page she seemed interested and could do with no problem was the shape and touch pages. The age listed for this book began with 12 months. I think it should begin more at 24 months."
2,Not worth the price,"It's a great concept but not worth the money. Some of the tasks don't go a long way toward teaching kids the skills the task is designed to teach. It looks like it was designed in a hurry, without much thought or testing and should be marketed for considerably less money."
2,I would NOT recommend,This was NOT what we thought it would be at all. It is very difficult for small people to use. I would look into another book for the money@
3,quiet book,"I liked the ""homemade"" one my mother made us when we were young. This is bright, but it seemed to be lacking a few of the essentials. They should of had a zipper, that unzips completely, buckles, toggles, and shoelaces that completely come apart to lace up, and something to braid with."
3,Musty,"The book is lovely but when I took it out of the plastic it smelled very musty. I opened it, spread the pages apart, and set in front of a fan for a couple of days. It's better but I can still smell it a little. That is my only complaint."
5,This is the greatest toy,"My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and I often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing. After dinner I find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine. She has learned how to button, use a zipper and problem solve by using this book. Also, I find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible. I have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it."
3,Great Concept. Expensive Book,I think this is an adorable book. The pieces are all attached and each page has a cute activity. Several things though--1. If you sew you can make one that is more directed to your child. And if you sew you will realize this is very over priced.2. Some of the activities are too hard for the age group that would be playing with this book.
2,Not safe,"My husband told me about this book. I bought it for our daughter because it says it is safe for babies, but it is NOT. One of the buttons came off and luckily I was near her to catch it before she put in her month. Is sad because is a great book and she loves it, but is cheaply made and dangerous for babies."
3,great except for one thing,"My daughter got this when she was 4 months old and she loves to flip through the ""pages"". It keeps her very busy. There is one negative thing though, the activities in the book are meant to teach like tying a shoe etc. why would you want to teach your child how to open the buckles that are the same style as on the high chairs and car seats we use. They should have put something else on that page. I am helping my daughter learn how to unbuckle herself from items we put her into to keep her safe."
3,Great for the car,My nearly 2 yr old enjoyed playing with this soft book on our recent road trip. However many of the pages/activities were too hard for her (physically)...the snaps were tuff to unsnap and the button wholes should be larger.
4,My Quiet Book,"My grandson received this for his 1 year birthday, and had a ball with it....he loves pulling the various objects from their respective pages, and tries to put them back - while not as accurate in returning the pieces to their right location in the book, he still has a ball pulling them off..."
3,it's okay,My son was given this for his 1 year old birthday. He likes the colors and the velcro pages. Other pages he will like as he gets older and can do them.
5,Great Hands-free trash can,"We saw this model of electric eye auto-opening trash can at our Dentist's office. After the 3rd or 4th visit I knew I wanted one. His was probably 10/12/14 gallons, we opted for this one for the bathroom. It fits perfectly and actually holds more than the SimpleLife model we had there. Added functionality is an OPEN button which will hold the lid open until you press the CLOSE button and a retaining ring to hold the trash bag securely. Nice touches. A little pricey for a trash can but Amazon had a great price."
2,terrible customer svc.,"this is the worst customer svc for the can. if you encounter an issue and have to deal with the co directly do not get this can. terrible... they take at least 5 days to get back with you and then they charge for every little issue. even if it's on their end, they charge you for the to and rtn postage. not worth the trouble."
3,ITouchless Stainless Steel 7 gallon,"This item is not for a small kitchen; it needs to be in a space where you are not! It is very sensitive and when you are not expecting, the lids pops open. It's gimmicky but can be annoying. I do like the touchless aspect in one respect, that I don't touch the unit."
4,"Adequate preparation, needs supplementation","This book is quite good in giving you excellent background preparation for the AP exam. The strategies are good, except that the only reason that I think it could be bad is if you don't ""vibe"" with their strategies, that is to say, they don't work for you. Personally, I found their essay section most helpful. They also need more practice tests and essays, as that would help immensly. Basically, it's a great book, but it's only slightly lacking."
2,Please People It's English!!,"Yes, reading this book can give you more insight into how AP readers grade the essays, but the fact of the matter is, that there is almost no way to study for either of the AP English exams. I took both the AP English exams without an AP class and I got a 4 on AP English Language and a 5 on AP English Literature. No class, no studying. Its pretty much, either you have it or you don't. For the objective section it's very much like the SAT I verbal critical reading sections. The essays are just analyzing, and one of them is an open ended question based on a novel you should have read sometime in your life. I would suggest just dropping by your local library and glancing through the book. Not worth buying."
4,Chronic Knee Pain for last 12 years,2 days considerably less pain in knees.......keep you posted and no popping of wrist or elbows when extended or bent.
5,IT APPEARS TO BE WORKING,I HAVE BEEN USING HYALURONIC JOINT COMPLEX FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AND IT HAS REDUCED MY JOINT PAIN.
4,Good pain reliever and best supplement that I have tried.,"I think that this is the best supplement that you can buy for knee problems. I get the series of shots every 6 months to alleviate pain, and this drug seems to quiet my knee down between those periods. I would recommend this product over the glucosamine and condroiton pills."
3,too early to tell,"This is my first bottle of a supplement containing Hyaluronic acid. I really don't feel like I can give a complete rating, but will say I have a cousin in Ky. that says pure Hyaluronic acid in liquid form has done wonders for her overall mobility problems with Arthritis."
3,"""Tablets"" Sounds Small But Make Me Sick. They Work!!","So I am 68 and my knee has begun giving out on me! It feels stiff and I did not injure it. It just began this stabbing pain if I turned it a certain way sometime after Christmas. I read the reviews on this and forgot about the word, ""tablets."" These things are so BIG , so HARD and , although I am able to swallow them , pills make me feel sort of nauseated. Not small ones; just horse pills like these. I will have to throw these out and will buy CAPSULES instead.I have taken 6 of these, one pill twice a day for 3 days and today my knee feels SO MUCH BETTER. I will still stop taking them since last night I got the Doctors' Best CAPSULES. But I admit to being thrilled with the overnight , dramatic improvement (so far) with this knee. I attribute it to these horse pills and am hoping the capsules work as well."
4,balanced supplement,"Ive been taking this product for 4 months to stimulate synovial fluid production and for overall joint health. Ive noticed much bettet "" recovery "" time when my joints hurt from exercise or work. I will continue to use it as recommended by my doctor."
2,Not for me,"I bought this product hoping it would help stop my arthritis pain. Didn't happenactually made my joints hurt more. Pain lessened when I stopped taking it, also pills are very large even larger than the omega capsuls I take.."
5,No more joint pain in my fingers,I have been taking this supplement consistently for about 6 weeks. My fingers used to hurt just lifting a coffee mug. Today - I notice no pain. I was also taking collegan at the same time - but I have stopped that and continue with this formula. The tablets are rather large and the dose is 2 per day - so I take one in the morning and one at night. I am placing another order. Very pleased.
2,Hard to swallow,"I have taken glucosamine supplements before with some success and was looking forward to this product with subscribe and save and Prime shipping. However, I have had alot of difficulty swallowing these rather large pills. I have never had a problem with other supplements. I tried cutting them in half and then fourths and finally started chewing them. Believe me, they were clearly not designed for tasting."
2,Pills are HUGE,"These pills are mega huge and you need to take four a day. The technology is out there to make a smaller pill, theseguys need to get with the program. I won't be buying these again because of the size of the pills."
4,A JOINT STATEMENT???,Hyaluronic joint complex appears to be giving me better knee joint feeling with less pain being currently felt but its a bit early yet to be sure?? The tablets are far to big and I have difficulty swallowing them??
3,Didn't help me much,"It may well be that my hip is too far gone to be helped, other than surgery. But I received no relief after taking this for a month."
1,Do not buy this,"Do not buy these as the tablets are so large that it actually hurts rubbing against your throat every time you take one. I am a pro athlete and take a lot of supplements, but this one is the worst. In fact, I took one of this and that's it, I am never going back to it and I am still on the lookout for a quality joint supplement."
5,Love it and amazon free shipping makes it 10x Better.,I am 26 and my knee is already bothering me. I have played basketball most my life and continue to play. So I need some relief. This product helped my knee out tremendously and made me feel alot better while playing. Although it maybe in my head it usually is not.Amazon offers free shipping on the 120 tablets which is a great value to jump on.
4,"Fast paced, tight story","I enjoyed this story very much. The Civil War action was written in a manner that draws the reader in.The author weaves a tight story with characters that are well fleshed out and not two dimensional. The storyline is a good, gripping tale set against the backdrop of the War in the West.The Western theater of the Civil War usually takes a back seat to the East among Historians and novelists alike. There are volume upon volume of books about Gettysburg, Bull Run, and Antietam. The heros of the East as well usually take center stage. So it was refreshing to get a different flavor with this book."
4,Christy Moore keeps getting better,"Christy Moore's new CD is a terrific, stripped down collection of beautiful songs, perfectly balancing Christy's voice with Declan Sinnott's restrained yet perfect guitar accompaniment. The only true ""foot-tapper"" is Sixteen Fisherman Raving written by Wally Page, which in itself is worth the purchase of this disc, but the ballads Christy's selected from some of his favorite songwriters (such as Bob Dylan, Natalie Merchant Richard Thompson and Morrissey) are better than the originals in my opinion. Highlights include Beeswing, The Lonsesome Death of Hattie Carrol, Mercy, Magdalene Laundries and Morrissey's acerbic ""America, I Love You"". Declan's brooding slide guitar on Mercy is also well worth a listen."
3,Great great GREAT cd... but ridiculously priced...,"This cd is wonderful, but for the money I paid I expected a full collection of his works! I would recommend just buying his live cd that has most the songs and costs 1/2 the price."
1,A Short Course in Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT/350D Photography (Book & eBook),"Don't buy this book! After I received it, I returned it the next day. It is almost the same as the manual that comes with your camera."
2,Glorified Manual,"I have to agree with what has been said thus far. This book is a big disappointment. The title suggested that the book was more of a course, which I took to mean a step by step guide, a how to if you will, with examples to follow using the Canon Rebel XT (like a course, duh) and what I got is some regurgiated mumbo jumbo from the manual. The book would have been better titled, ""A Beginner's Guide to the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT""."
1,Probably the worst book - it's like a xerox copy,"Real bad book, you're much better off buying the digital rebel field guide, by charlotte K Lowrie,"
4,Great working tool for real life experiences!,"2 of 2 people found the following review helpful:A Portable Identity: A Woman's Guide to Maintaining a Sense, June 28, 2004Reviewer: J (Washington, D.C) - See all my reviewsAnyone ever to encounter and navigate the endless and exhaustive details involved with moving and living overseas will appreciate the meticulous care and thought that went into this primer. The exercises and for planning for and understanding the different stages, emotions and thought processes that accompany such a move are terrific, not just for the move itself, but for a very effective and smooth assimilation of this kind of life-changing experience.I will be giving this one to many of my friends who are also contemplating living and working overseas."
5,Heart of Midnight,"Fiona Brand has something special, a touch with characterization that doesn't come along very often. Her books are sexy, well-written, and out of the ordinary. It's not a question of ""if"" she goes mainstream, but ""when."""
5,Awesome backpack,"At first, I was a bit worried that it was made by JanSport. The brand never registered well with me since my first college backpack from them ripped to pieces.After looking at other reviews, I decided to buy this one in Bokchoy Green. Bag arrived and it turned out to be awesome. Great pockets, tons of storage, notebook sleeve is good (it is a bit small for my MacBook Pro but it still works).iPod integration or any MP3 for that matter is a nice touch.Straps are strong. The only negative is the strap excess- there needs to be a way to tie them out of the way.Other than that, the bag has held up well. Great bag. I've changed my mind about Jansport."
3,A little variety,"My children (6 and 10 years old) like to play sometimes this game, not as often as other games (say Kirby or Joshi Island), but I have to say it have added some variety in their choices during weekends."
2,Please Help!,"The reason for the low star rating is because I cannot figure out how to get out of the first level! I can get past the first vile gemlette however once I ""disable"" the two gemlettes I have no idea what to do next! Can someone please help! I would probably score the game higher if the instructions were a little more clear on this."
3,Muy sencillo falta acción,"Si fuera tan irreverente y loco como son las comiquitas sería excelente pero de verdad me decepcionó podría ser más entretenido, mis hijos terminaron el juego como en una semana de lo sencillo que es. Y ahora prácticamente ni se acuerdan que existió este juego."
4,Nice,"I buy 3-D steroegram books in attempts to work on my eyes and hopefully improve my vision. 3-D Planet is a good book. My personal favorite is still Super Sterorgram by Cadence books, 1994."
5,Profound and meaningful,"I loved this book; it was moving and written with an elegant grace, despite its dark content. It's difficult to write about mental illness with humor and charm, but Laura Love succeeds here where many others have failed. Excellent."
2,Looks like a kid's toy,"It looks like a toy cell phone. It's white like the original picture, it's not at all like the 2nd customer supplied pic. You have to open the phone and press the ""ok"" button to get zapped. While all of my victims opened the phone, very few pressed the ok button. A better design would zap when you opened the phone."
1,cheap cheap cheap,I expected it to look better - It shocks good -but boy is it cheap looking -I bought it for my grandson i really don't know if he'll like it
2,I'd sell it to over 18.,"This a really shocking toy!... I would recommend it to over 18, not over 13... Imagine a teenager joking around with this toy, and accidentally make a joke to heart diseased person... this toy can virtually kill people if it's in wrong hands... Absolutly not recommended for kids and teenagers."
3,Toy Cell Phone,"This phone was made to be a gag gift, however that's not what I used it for. I just needed a fake plastic cellphone for a Halloween costume. It looks fairly realistic, although the one I received was red instead of gray. The phone is very cheaply made, but does provide a nice shock if you flip it open and press the ok button."
4,Helpful information,"I really like this book. We are planning an extensive trip (or several) into the Mexican interior and will be staying a lot of the time in campgrounds but didn't have a clue! This book gives very helpful little details, for instance, it explains that one campground has various people who host and don't know exactly how much to charge. Lots of information. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because we haven't put the book into action yet."
2,"Let's not fool ourselves, this has very little to do with camping...",Call me old fashioned but from what I recall camping involves pitching a tent and sleeping in it. This book has very little to do with camping. It has a lot of information concerning driving around Mexico in those enormous RV's (sometimes I wonder what is the point of leaving home).This book does have a lot of useful information concerning border crossings and insurance and the like. It also some very nice descriptions of the towns and activities in the area.
1,Poor quality and fit.,"This item is far too ""universal"" to be worthwhile. Even with all the configuration options, it did not fit my '90 Miata properly. I would recommend Crutchfield for this type of application as they always provide a guaranteed fit for your vehicle."
3,Jacob Have I Loved,"My class at school read this book. Some parts were interesting, but I found a lot of the book to be boring. I especially didn't like the part where Louise is in love with a 70-year-old (ugh)."
4,Ending was a let-down,"Ok, first off, I think this book does a great job at presenting Wheeze's family - through her eyes. When I first read this book, I was so mad that her family would treat her the way they did. Then I stepped back, and thought about it a little, and found that if you think about it, Caroline didn't really have the perfect life. She had mountains of pressure put on her from a young age to be a great singer, she had to go to a big preppy school with BORROWED money and (I'm sure) put up with all the snotty rich kids looking down their noses at her. I think the old man was right to give the money to Caroline, since she was the one who knew what she wanted to do. ... Overall, I thought the whole book was good, except for the ending, ..."
1,"When I read this as a kid, I did not enjoy it","It has been a while since I have read this, but as I recall it was rather lousy. The theme of sibling jealousy grew tiresome; it would have made a fine subplot rather than the focus of the novel. Writing children's literature is difficult because the author must avoid dumbing down the content, and Paterson did a decent job of this. But she skews the perspective of the book towards that of a child not as Harper Lee did, with a different outlook on the facts, but rather everything is vague and unclear. Thoughts are jumbled and when Sara grows up and finds herself at the end, you don't care. Why? The picture of Sarah isn't there admist the author's blurring of emotion.Kids, even if they are mistaken, know exactly what they are feeling. There is no confusion. Sarah is as confused as the reader, and the plot remains weak with no writing to boost it up.There are better children's literature, such as The Giver."
4,"An excellent book about how I think, many siblings feel.","Children of all ages, even teenagers, should read this book because I think many of us kids can relate to the way ""Wheeze"" feels about her sister."
3,"I found the book witty, but sort of dull","Katherine Patterson did a great job of really taking apart and breaking down Sara Louise's charecter, so that the reader got to view every aspect of it. However, the storylin was pretty dry at many points of the book, and di not have the excitement to really hold me to the book."
5,It was TERRIFIC!!!,Patterson really describes Sara Louise's change throughout the story and really shows how two sisters can love and he another!! An exceptionally well written book! A must read for any teenage girl!!
4,Wonderful,"This story tells the story of a teenage girl living on an island in MA, during WWII, and how she grew out of her twin sister's shadow."
3,"Less Than ""Terabithia"" or ""Gilly Hopkins""","Paterson writes younger teen level ""problem"" novels. This one is about sibling rivalry, centered on a character who may or may not have a legitimate gripe. I've never decided if Louise has a real case, or is an unreliable narrator, but I have concluded that that question is what makes this novel an interesting choice for a ya reader.Both ""Terabithia"" and ""Gilly Hopkins"" tell straightforward stories, which seem much more engaging and accessible. I would start a younger reader with one of these before trying ""Jacob Have I Loved"". And you know, I would be reluctant to make this assigned reading, because I really think Paterson is something of an acquired taste, and she often seems to be a writer who is imposed on readers, (like Willa Cather), rather than introduced to readers."
4,Sibling rivalry,"Louise and Caroline are twins, but they are nowhere near identical. In Louise's eyes, it is Caroline who is brilliantly talented and it is Caroline who is beautiful; Louise finds it is Caroline who is given special privileges and treats while Louise is given nothing. The story is told from Louise's point-of-view so it is hard to tell whether Caroline's special treatment is real or is just the way it is seen from the eyes of a jealous sister. In some ways, it is obvious that Louise is cast aside; Louise's grandmother has nothing but disdain for her. Whatever the reality of the preferential treatment, it is very real to Louise. I couldn't help feeling deep sorrow for Louise as she is continually set aside and set aside for a lovelier and gifted sister."
3,Summer Reading Novel for 8th Graders,"The book is very slow in the beginning, but when you understand the title/parable, everything makes sense and the rest of the book is a breeze!"
2,Bitter Sibling Rivalry,"I read this book because it was a Newberry Winner, but I really didn't enjoy it. The description of the fishing village was informational, and the setting was charming, but what ruined the book for me was the bitterness of the main character. What happens in life is often unfair, but learn to forgive and move forward. The main character's conflict is only partially resolved by her decision to never neglect a child in the way in which she was neglected. I ended up disliking the two sisters for different reasons. For a milder example of sibling rivalry read The Little House on the Prairie Series."
4,Jacob Have I Loved,Jacob Have I Loved is a good book. Although it is sad in some parts I still liked it. I felt as though I were there by the sea in an ugly pair of clothes catching crabs. The characters are a girl named Louise and her sister named Caroline. She had a friend whom she called Call. Call and Louise were noticed as they come off of a ferry. They found out were his house was and followed him there. Then they become friends. Read the book to find out what happens. It ia a good book.
5,Amazing book,"Jacob have I loved was one of the best books I have read so far. Jacob have I loved is a book that talks about Sara Louise Bradshaw, a teenage girl, always having to live in the shadow of her twin sister, Caroline. Caroline is loved by many and given all the attention while Louise is often left out and forgotten. This book has a somewhat odd plot, yet it is interesting. This book is great for 7th graders as well as 8th graders because it has to do with natural things kids at that age feel and it doesnt feel odd to read about it. Katherine Paterson is an amazing, as well as descriptive writer and she introduces each character so well, that at the end of the book, you feel as though you actually know them. I also reccommend Bridge to Terebithia by Katherine Paterson as well."
1,Time is money!!,"I am impressed by how this author can explain people's feelings very well. However, those techniques made me depressed. This book, ""Jacob Have I Loved,"" makes me confused and very sad! The main heroine, Wheeze, is a pessimist because her twin sister, Caroline, who is nice and beautiful, took everything from Wheeze's life (she thinks this way). For example, Wheeze's best friend proposed to her twin sister Caroline. Also one of their friends wanted to give a scholarship to Caroline not Wheeze. So, I had to read about her inferiority complex and weakness. This is a waste of time for me! If Wheeze changes her negative thoughts, she will be able to be thankful for her life, family, and good friends. Maybe Wheeze could marry her best friend too. I didn't want to read this book; however, my English class had to read it. If I could have stopped reading, I would have done it!!! If you are not American, I don't want to recommend that you buy this book. I promise it is a waste of money for you!"
1,Disappointing and Depressing,"I read this book and was greatly disappointed throughout. It was depressing and extremely annoying. This book is inappropriate for young teenagers, especially when the main character, Sara Louise, lusts for a 70 year old man. Disgusting.The ending did not make up for the long, long, drawn-out torture of enduring the main character's pain and hatred. The supposed happy ending made no sense considering what a messed-up teenager she was. The last 2 chapters tried to tie things up nicely to make the reader feel relieved that the main character grew up and made a good life for herself. However, those chapters have little relationship to the rest of the book. How did she magically get over her hatred of her sister and herself? Just by yelling at her mother, she is suddenly cured?I do not recommend this book. I'm still wondering why it received a Newbery Medal."
1,Dont bother reading this book,THis book is full of hatred. I couldn't shake the feeling of anger for several days after reading this book. She never askes her sisters forgiveness. Nothing is really resolved. it is a waste of time.
1,Jacob Have I Loved,"I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours."
4,A shocking ending!,"I read this book and think that the author didn't do a great job of detailing. For instance, Hiram Wallace and Joseph were hard to picture as to what they looked like.The main character had a major probelm with self-esteem. Everyone turned on her that was on the island of Rass. It was a very heartfelt story with a shocking ending. I think that there were clues that led up to the end, but I won't tell you anymore about it (except that it was good and would recommend it to someone who loves to read)."
4,Not Too Shabby!,"Jacob Have I Loved is an amazing novel about finding yourself and becoming your own person-- It centers around the tomboy Sara Louise and the sibling rivilry she has for her twin sister... Sara Louise hates her life on Rass Island, but can't seem to compete with her sister to get off... Good book for anyone who has a ""perfect"" sibling or is trying to discover the ""real"" them. The writing style I believe was a little unusual (vocab and such) but very, very interesting and new... I liked it!"
3,Sad but Interesting,"Lousia and Caroline are twin girls who live on a small island. Lousia has a tough life because of her talented sister Caroline. Their grandmother lives with them and drives them all crazy. Lousia ends up meating a new friend who's name is Captain, but Caroline ends up taking over Lousia's frendship with Captain. The Captain even payed for Caroline to go to the University of Baltimore. Read to find out what happens to Lousia and Caroline and their relationship."
1,Depressing and NOT A BOOK FOR CHILDREN!,"I read this book at the young age of 13 and it had a terrible impression on me. It made me afraid to grow up, and I felt continuelly depressed about the blant favoritism shown by the girls parents.If I was their parents I would not have kept that crazy and wicked grandmother around I don't care who she is. She went out of her way to hurt Louise. That's just plain wicked.I also found Louise's sudden interest in being a doctor quite unbelieveable. She had never mentioned anything like that before and I just found it innane.I also found it disturbing that they had her falling in love with someone so much older then herself. Children can't look at that and make any sense of it. It was so embrassing to me that i didn't tell my parents till years later how uncomfortable I felt about it.I would never recommond this book to anyone ever! Certainly never for children and certainly not for anyone else."
1,Why do people like this?,"I still fail to understand why this is such a popular book. I hated it the first time I read it and read it again because I thought I must be missing something. If I was, I guess I'm still missing it. The entire book is a girl whining about how her life stinks. I can understand that she isn't happy, but it is her own fault. She doesn't do anything and then expects to have equal attention with her twin who does. She is ready to take offense at anything even when it isn't really unfair."
2,Jacob Have I Loved; like a never ending poem,"At first glance, you may think this book is about a girl falling in love with ""Jacob."" The title is nothing but a biblical reference to ""Jacob have I loved, but Esau I have hated,"" a story about a fathyer favoring his sons. Most of the story is quite boring, about two sisters, Caroline and Louise, who are subject to favoritism within their family. I disliked this book manily because every other word needs to be analyzed to get any real meaning from the story. I read this in school but I wouldn't recommend for pleasure."
2,"This book had a message, but it wasn't for me!","Some people may have liked this book, but I didn't! One of my teachers didn't even like this book! I go to a Christian school and we had to read this book, but it was a waste of time to me."
2,Not worthy of the award,"I am totally blown away by the thought of a 14-year-old girl being romantically attracted to and interested in a man old enough to be her grandfather. And all of this just ""hit her"" when she hugged him? Not very believable to me. Why would something like this be written for children?"
1,Jacob Have I Loved,I hate this book because its a horrible book and it has terrible and annoying characters. I hope someone never reads this book because it really stinks. Read with caution.
4,a good soliloquy of growing up,"This book takes place on a small island in Massachusetts, which makes for a lot of tension between characters. As a result, the main character picks up and moves, leaving everything behind her. ""Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."" Romans 3:12"
5,My fave. book,"I read Jacob Have I Loved when I was in third grade, in an advanced reading group. I, like some others, thought that it would revolve around a love story. But it's VERY different from my first thoughts. I'd reccomend this book to any girl, it quickly became my favorite book. I bought it, and I now read it constantly...almost once every day. This is one of the greatest books you'll ever read, believe me."
3,Very Good--But Written For Mature Readers,"I read this book growing up and recently re-read it. It is an excellent story of an independent teen who feels her younger twin sister receives all of the spotlight and her parents concerns. It is a coming of age book, and is very moving.The age listed begins age 9, but I feel a more accurate range would be 16+. There is a section that deals with her unexpected feelings towards a much older man. At the end of the book, it refers to her breastfeeding a baby that is not hers.Again--it is a wonderful book, but I personally feel it is for more mature audiences."
4,jacob have i loved,"Sarah Louise tells us her story throughout many of her experiences in her life. She is a twin and her sister, unfortunately for her, is better in many ways. She is talented, beautiful, and besides that she does everything right. Everybody loves her. It seems that no one pays attention to what Sarah does. Call is her best friend; together they catch crabs in the ocean. He doesn't really like her jokes and he thinks they are dumb. One day, a captain came to the island, and she started to love him. With all these adventures I think this is what makes this book a really good book. I think that you can"
5,I LOVED JACOB HAVE I LOVED!,"This is actually a very great book. It really makes you happy reading it.I loved it because it was magnificent. Normally, I don't use words like that but this is a slightly different situation. Sars Louise, the main charecter, struggles with her anger towards her twin sister while she strongly believes that God hates her. This story about finding yourself absolutely tops all the rest."
4,A rich collection of commentary on Maine Lobsterboats.,"Thorndike has assembled a thoroughly engrossing collection of solid information, individual viewpoints, opinions and tall tales about the Maine lobsterboat told in their own words by the people who know and love them best. Each interview unveils the character of the individual as well as the boats they talk about. Downeast life on the water comes alive in the droll understated humor that is their characteristic means of expression. The book is pure pleasure."
5,Moving Men 1545-12 8 Piece Furniture Slider Set,"I have very serious Arthritis as well as Fibromyalgia, consequently I need something to help me when I need to move almost anything. These sliders are wonderful, and make life, for me, much easier. I keep the sliders under some furniture all of the time. I plan to buy more of them. I highly recommend this product."
3,Good on non carpeted floors,Great for moving furniture on my tile floors. Would not work on the carpet. Might work better on a very low carpet like berber.
1,Product did not live up to the reviews,"Reading over all the reviews I thought the heck with it, I'll get a set since I need to move a ton of furniture. Well, they didn't help much if at all. Made sure the hardwood floor was clean, and the sound of these moving over the hardwood wasn't pleasant. I stopped using these once I moved a computer desk, would not recommend to anyone with hardwood floors, they seem to be a product to be used on carpet."
1,MAGIC SLIDERS ARE BETTER,"These are too big and slip off the furniture - they appear to be made of flimsy plastic. I like Magic Sliders, which I have used in the past, much better - they really are like magic and work perfectly on wood floors as well as carpet. The kind that are self stick and stick to the furniture legs are the best - others have to be tacked on which is impossible when you have to get them under a heavy piece of furniture. I couldn't tell from the description which kind Amazon was selling so I tried these instead,to my regret. I should have taken the negative reviews more seriously. I will now have to go to a local store and look for Magic Sliders."
1,"Does nothing, waste of money",Does not work well. It's just a plastic saucer with some foam stuck on top. And the plastic is just plain ordinary plastic. Do not waste your money. You can get comparable results just slipping on some old plastic plates or cut out milk jug instead of buying this. Waste of money.
1,does not work on hardwood floors,this does not work on hardwood floors. worse with the sliders than without. does not make it easier to move the heavier furniture. do not recommend if you have hardwood floors. probably better to hire people or take out all the drawers off heavy furniture before moving.
5,GREAT,I purchased these back in February and am just now getting the opportunity to utilize them and I must say... they are great. I recently hurt my back but still wanted to move my son's over size heavy furniture around in his room.I moved everything with ease and with no problems on my extra thick carpet.
5,Great service,A hard to find item that I was happy to able to find here. Received in perfect tiem and would by again from the seller
2,Save your money,"We were moving from a house that was 99% carpet to a house with 100% hardwood. These worked okay on carpet, but not that great. They were useless on hardwood. You would be better off with a real furniture dolly. I ended up having to go buy one because these were useless once we got off the carpet."
1,Can only be used on carpet,"I cannot believe I bought these things. Total impulse buy but I thought they would be useful.They are NOT. What it doesn't say in the product description is that they can only be used on carpet. Not hardwood floors. They will scratch the dickens out of your floors. I wasn't really paying attention when I opened the box they came in so the return time period expired by the time I realized this. Oh well, maybe I can sell them at a garage sale."
1,Moving Appliances,"The disks work quite well on carpeting and tile. If your appliance has wheels these are not as valuable, but can still be of benefit on carpeting."
1,Didn't work for me...,Pretty much worthless for me. Under a fairly heavy bookcase they might as well been glued to the ground.
3,Half & Half,The small sliders work very well. The large ones are just too big & bulky for most furniture.
2,Not the best example of this type of product,"These are not ideal for wood floors. I recommend the type that look like muppets - they are much easier to get under the furniture and glide better.After moving three pieces of furniture, these sliders look four years old - scratched, dirty and indented from the weight. The white lip is curved up slightly, which makes it hard to slip under, and harder for me to do solo - and I'm no weakling.I think there are better examples of this product, especially the furry ones that I got at Home Depot for our house in NJ."
1,Terrible for wood floors,"We used these at home on clean wood floors, and they scratched the floors terribly. Perhaps they're fine on carpet, but keep these away from wood floors."
5,Great !,My friend and I moved a heavy filing cabinet (with contents inside) and a very big and heavy entertainment center from Ethan Allen. I planned a move for 30 mins but we were done in half that time. I noticed some minor (hardly noticeable) scratches on my wood floor - nothing significant. I think this can be avoided if you wipe Moving Men clean first and also sweep floor of any debris beforehand.
4,Not for wood floors,The instructions that come with the sliders tell you not to use them on scratchable (i.e. wood) floors. The advertising write up should mention that before you buy them.
5,love it!,"I was 7 months pregnant when I had to move to a new place, and had to move around dressers and 3-sectional couch! These sliders worked great! I didn't need any extra help with them! Plus it's easy on your carpet and you don't risk damaging it! I highly recommend the set. The price is very good as well!"
2,NOT FOR HARDWOOD FLOORS !,"The Moving Man sliders may work fine on carpets, but they scratched my hardwood floor when using them to move a recliner sofa. The bottoms of the sliders were also badly scratched after the move."
5,Why didn't I buy these years ago?,"I can't believe how much easier these have made my life. I will keep the small set under my Christmas tree all year long. It was so hard to drag that thing out of the spare room into the living room every Christmas because the legs just dug so deep into the carpet - and now it just slides with incredible ease. I have moved a cedar chest as well as a desk. If something is left on them for a period of time, huge dents will be created, but the material will pop back to normal soon after. It's nice I don't have to wait for my husband to be around if I want to rearrange. They do work on tile floor but it scratches and scuffs up the bottom of the sliders. Although it doesn't appear to affect their performance, they are best for carpet."
2,furniture sliders,"Moving Men 8-Piece Furniture Slider SetThis is okay for moving furniture on a rug. Do not use them on bare floors of any kind, regardless of what the directions say. I made the mistake of believing the directions, that they would not scratch non scratchable floors. They may not scratch them, but they do mar them. The mar will probably rub out with some work, but am not happy that happened. They work very well on carpeted floors and are almost effortless with that task. So I am not recommending this product for uncovered flooring of any kind, but will give it a heads up for carpeted floors."
2,Not for heavy furniture,"These furniture sliders are fine for a chair or light furniture but not for a heavy sofa. They slide out, and the small ones are almost useless for anything with weight."
2,they dont work on heavy furniture,Dont plan on using these with heavy furniture like an entertainment center. It sinks into the carpet just like the item itself.
5,Moving Men,For anyone who likes to rearrange their furniture from time to time without waiting on a man to be there. This is iT!
1,they hardly slip on carpet,These are just awful. Don't waste your time--spend a bit more and get discs that actually slip. These almost don't work--too much friction for carpet.
5,Nourished......In My Mother's Kitchen,"Robin Adelman's storytelling flare is what lures us into this very helpful guide to remembering. In a pragmatic (workbook format), yet sensitive way she turns us inward to the stories that bring lost loved ones back into our consciousness and back into our hearts. In My Mother's Kitchen teaches us to tell our stories, painful or peaceful, happy or sad. Because telling our stories bears our souls, we become transformed in the process. Robin took me to places that I had forgotten to go. Read this book and become nourished In My Mother's Kitchen."
5,Food for the Spirit,"This is a book for anyone who is trying to deal with the loss of a loved one. Written with loving clarity, In My Mother's Kitchen is food for the spirit. More importantly, it's a book about moving on into the future without having to sacrifice the past. Full of gentle wit and sage advice, this book is necessary reading for those who grieve while also learning to celebrate the spirit of the lived life."
3,The Curious Little Owl,"I read this book to my children years ago. The inside was good, but the cover was pretty beat up."
5,Functional & Beautiful,"Not too big, not too small, so you can keep it at the ready on your kitchen counter (I cover it loosely with a clear plastic bag from a bread loaf). The bowl is 'heavy' - very heavy, so it stays in place - you don't want to drop it on your bare foot.It's a beautiful (and ancient-looking) piece of kitchen ware. I've crushed peppercorns using very slight pressure; mashed shelled walnuts and almonds into pastes; turned large turbinado sugar crystals into fine grains; same with salt crystals. It's also perfect for making onion powder from dried, minced onions.It's easy to clean with soap and water or only water."
5,Super Great Marble Mortar and Pestle,"Solid, heavy, deep and everything I could have hoped for and more in a mortar and pestle. I was using an antique mortar and pestle, but felt using this new one would save the old one from breaking. This thing will grind up just about anything you can put into it. I don't care if it gets stained by whatever is being ground down or made into paste - it shows it's still a very functional item despite it being invented 1000's of years ago. Some things you just can't improve on."
5,Pleased,"Very nice. ~3""w x 2.5""d Quite substantial. I have seen similar products in gift stores for $30-$40. Solid marble, so don't let your kids play with it ;*)"
3,not really white marble,"I bought this because it looks like pure white marble, but when I received it, it is actually black and white marble, and I did some research, according to which black marble could be radioactive, so I had to return it. I wish it was pure white marble'"
4,New Contemporary Voice--Make it 4.5 Stars!,"This is a sharp, smartly written contemporary for those of us tired of all the novels with fabulously wealthy ad execs, lawyers, clothing designers, winery owners, etc. Consider this more of a blue collar romance with crisp dialogue, a good mystery, loads of pets and lots of messy unspoken feelings just like real life. I especially liked how smoothly the male lead moved into our female leads' life. She feels kinda dumbfounded at how quick everything has happened, how right it all seems and how she REALLY couldn't come up with a good offense--so she picks a fight! Sometimes a person just needs to do SOMETHING with mis-placed emotions. Living close to the CA Central Coast the entire book plays out in a natural way. Grab this one up and be happy for a new author on the radar to watch for at last!"
1,not recommended for amateur installers,"I ordered one of these to install a new stereo in a Ford Focus, but it also included tabs for a Mercury Cougar -- tabs that must be ""trimmed flush"" before you can use it with a Focus. I tried all sorts of knives and box cutters, but had no luck cutting the extremely thick plastic tabs, which are not easy to access with anything but a small cutting tool. Eventually the plastic broke at a much weaker point. Now I have to decide whether to try to glue this one back together at the damaged point -- and still try to remove the tabs -- or buy a new one -- and still try to remove the tabs. Very frustrating."
1,They were not thinking at all,"The title is ironic to say the least. People who give up their own religion of which they usually know little about to embrace another religion are generally not thinking for themselves at all but instead are allowing someone else to think for them. Religious fundamentalism is the opposite of free thought. As for the stories in this book, they are both simplistic and lack credibility.If you were going through a hard time would you like a friend to give you the Koran or a book designed specifically to ""help"" you change your religion? Isn't it obvious that since most people follow the faith of their parents that none of them have a monopoly on truth. How arrogant and lacking in humility it is to try to convert people."
1,jews for jesus stop,stop trying to convert jewish people. This book was sent to me in the mail. i am jewish and will die jewish.
1,Why lie? Isn't the truth good enough?,"I too received this book in the mail with a letter. This form of religious hocus-pocus, bait-and-switch is what gives all religions a bad name. To start with such a bold-faced lie on the cover, ""Ten Amazing Jews"", is the beginning of the end. If a person's beliefs require them to lie on the cover of their book, then what good person would want anything to do with them, or their beliefs. Simply an amazing bit of clap-trap and a waste of my time and the paper it is printed on."
1,Thinly veiled attempt at conversion,"I too received this book in the mail, and was partway into the first chapter before I realized what it was. If you are going to proselytize, you should at least be straight forward about it. Sid Roth, I think your return on investment here is incredibly low."
1,This is Trash at Best,"This is offensive, and clueless. No one should be allowed to distribute such blatant crap. It showed up in the mail because a Christian or Christian organization is trying to sell me something that clearly isn't Christian and it is written by someone who clearly isn't Jewish because he doesn't know history or religion."
1,Anti Semitism at its worst,Its the ultimate anti semitism. Flood the market with this worthless garbage and hope that Jews will stop being Jews and believe there twisted view of the truth. I am doing what most Jewish friends I know are doing with this book and throwing it in the trash can where they all belong.
5,Amazing Testimony,"Anytime you see that name 'Sid Roth', you already expect to read something amazing and different. He doesn't disappoint in this book. The testimonies are amazing. This book is sure to have a huge impact on your life!"
1,Waste of Paper and Postage!,"This book and its author are worse than door to door proselytizers, because they entered my home without my consent.I also wonder how this author found my name. I've already decided it's not going to be recycled. It's already outside in the trash can among the other garbage."
1,I can see why this book is so cheap,"A strange amalgam of supernatural superstition + new age-like mumbo jumbo + prosperity gospel + quasi-""Jews for Jesus"" propaganda. Was not uplifting in its message, nor inspiring."
1,Jews for Jesus,"I received this book in the mail for free, for some unknown reason. The book has been sitting in a mail pile for the past year, of things I had to go through. I finally picked it up, and read through a couple chapters. I was surprised. I thought I was going to read to some incredible journeys, or something to that affect.I was wrong. Each story I read had the protagonist find faith in Jesus. Nothing wrong with that. But the premise of the book is not Jews finding faith in Christianity. And the ""letter"" that came with the book in the mail was a bait and switch tactic.Thumbs down Mr. Roth."
1,They though for themselves- ten amazing jews,"As an observant Jew, I- like many others, received this document in the mail. I dont think it deserves to be called a book. The title says it all..... They thought for themselves.....in other words, if you are a jew, and practice the jewish faith, think for yourself! Gee, thanks for the insult. The thing is, whenever I speak to chrisitians, and the topic of religion comes up, I often point out the many contradictions within christianity! And ask those folks to think for themselves. Perhaps if they did, they would convert to judaism. For example, if jesus was a jew, and practiced the jewish faith, shouldnt christians, how are supposedly followers of jesus, also practice the jewish faith?Anyhow, there is no proof in matters of faith, and to each his own. Thats my advice to Sid Roth. Stick to your own folks, because to us Jews, your document is a joke."
1,Disgusting display of trickery,"Like many others here I received this abomination in the mail for free. I leafed through it and read one sentence, thats all I needed, I knew what this garbage was about about and put it where it belonged, in the garbage. The gall these people have to try and trick people into reading their trash and stupidity is appalling.If your new religion were so great you wouldnt have to trick people into wanting to join they would come on their own. Since they dont it should tell you something."
1,Manipulative nonsense,"Received this book for free in the mail. The reason why this author thinks these 10 Jews were amazing is because they all believed in Jesus. I find it anti-semetic and awful. I am offended by the author, the book, the concept, everything about it."
1,cheap propaganda,"I just received this book in the mail today. After reading the letter that came with the book, i decided to research the ""ten amazing jews"". After the first four names I entered it became clear that this piece of drivel was nothing but a propaganda piece. These are not amazing tales, they are blatant self promotion pieces. The true motive of the book is apparent, to lure the desperate, the weak, and the gullible for their own personal gain."
1,HEED THE WARNING!,"Can't add much to what's already been waxed, but do agree with the negative contingency. This book is hyperbole and more or less either a Prosthelytizing tool or a way to spread hatred and xenophobia. Well done Mr. Roth...or is that Rothchild!"
2,"Pithy, cliche riddled book","Don't waste your money on this pithy, fluffed out simple book with nothing new to say. It is obvious the writer only wanted to make money not enlighten people. Not an original thought in the whole book, which was skimpy (250 pages with large print) and repeats itself over, and over."
1,I am not a Jew!,Simply put: I am NOT a Jew! How the heck did I get this spam in the mail is beyond me. It's trash.
1,Came in the mail,"Another person here who received this book in the mail (and I'm not even Jewish).All religion is fabricated nonsense so I'm not going to pretend to be insulted. It would be nice, however, if religious people would learn to keep their ridiculous beliefs to themselves. If these goofy God superstitions help you through your life then good for you but please leave the rest of us alone."
1,Much the same as they others who received this in the mail,Not much more I can add that the majority of the others have stated. I received this crud in the mail and not as offended but more curious if there were any tax breaks of any kind to send so many free copies through the USPS bulk rate. I can't see anyone outright purchasing but hope to use this hub to help prevent many others from wasting time even spending one minute reading the words within.
3,predictably polarizing,"I'm a gentile. A friend thought I'd like this book and loned it to me. Predictably, it's polarizing. If you believe in Jesus it gets 5 stars and if you don't 1 star. I can understand that for Jews this is a painful book to read. You might as well give them Mein Kampf and tell them how insightful and wonderful it is. On the other hand, if the claims made by the people in this book are true, they'll stand up to an investigation. Many of you wrote comments about not wasting your time or money with this book and then said you read half of the first chapter. Look, read this book and then if you want condemn it. It's short, easy to read and it's no more a waste of time or money as what you invest in Cable TV. Think for yourself...don't let anyone do it for you...don't let your traditions or even this book get in the way. Just read it and make up your own mind."
1,Throw in garbage or send back this unsolicited book?,"I can't decide whether to throw it in the garbage or send this unsolicited book back to the address it came from. Cover is very deceiving and having read the first story, it's intent is quite clear....to convince Jews to believe in Jesus."
1,Attempt to Convert Jews Masked as Story,"This book arrives in the mail to jewish households around the US. It comes with a ""kind"" message from Sid Roth about how G-d instructed him to write this book to inspire other Jews about our people. It doesn't mention Christianity, Jesus or anything religious at all. Just an inspirational book about other Jewish people. However, the book itself, is not a story of Jews. It is a story of conversion away from Judaism. It is an attempt to convert Jews masked as an inspirational book. It is no different from someone ringing your doorbell attempting to save you. While everyone has the right to their own opinion, it cannot be reviewed on it's literary merits."
1,Another Jews for Jesus Book,"Please don't even waste your time here. It was sent free in the mail. Cheap paper. The author is a disgruntled Jew who found Christianity suited him better. Fine, but save us the drivel.A Great book for Jews who are searching is 'This Is My God' by Herman Wouk. It gives you the essence of what Judaism is all about. I would highly recommend this book to Sid Roth, who knows little about the subject.P.S. For those interested in historical Jewish-Christian relations, a good book to read would be 'Constantine's Sword', by James Carroll. The author is a jounalist for the Boston Globe who studied to be a Paulist priest. The book explains the very complex and difficult history between these two great religions."
1,What a sham scam,"You get what you pay for. When a book comes in the mail for free, be suspicious. When it boldly proclaims on the cover that over 1 million copies in print, understand that it probably means that no one is stupid enough to pay for it. Sid Roth ought to be prosecuted for sham efforts to turn Jews into Christians. And for producing so much trash by wasting so many trees, meaning what he is harming the environment. The only good thing to say is that at least he is supporting the US Postal Service."
1,Very misleading book,This is not about 10 amazing Jews. It's about the authors view that good things happen when Jews believe in Jesus. Read 2 chapters and threw it out. You should not buy this book if you think it's going to be inspirational because it's junk
3,Think for Yourself Sid,"I was not turned off that the ten amazing Jews turned out to be ""Jews for Jesus"". Neither Judaism (Messianic or conventional)nor Christianity, nor any other established religion has a monopoly on THE Savior or THE truth. None of these religions were founded by the Savior in whose name they operate. If Sid Roth is true to his word, he will go even beyond the dogma of Messianic Judaism and conventional organized religion. He will research and study how many saints and seekers have practiced religion in the sense of ""re"" ""ligere"" - binding back the soul to God through first hand spiritual experience.JESUS SURVIVED CRUCIFIXION"
4,thought,"God has given us all a mind to think with. We have a destiny and need to hear from God what that destiny is. Everyone has a special destiny, the Jew and Christion alike, but few reach it."
1,disgusting book sent in the mail,Like other reviewers I received this book in the mail. I realized right away it was Jews for Jesus with a deceptive title. It will be mailed back to sender marked up so it cannot be sent to someone else.
1,Jewish Mormon,"Thank you for the above reviews. I happen to be a fourth generation Mormon with a ""Jewish"" last name - so naturally, I received this book. So glad I didn't have to waste my time on this propaganda nonsense clearly targeting Jewish sir names. I almost brewed a cup of hot green tea and sat down with this book out of curiosity as I love to learn of all sides to a discussion. Glad my time wasn't wasted on unnecessary manipulation."
1,"I Want My Time Back, Not Just My Money","With the price being so low and reading the description I figured even if it's not that good I'ts still worth 3 bucks, well I was wrong awfully wrong, this book is a cheat.If only I would make a book for every dream I had..."
1,A Big Oh-Oh!,"I am a Christian minister and pastor and figure it might be worth something for me to add to what has already been written as to what I think about the book. This book was left at a food bank I supervise by someone who found it really inspiring and recommended it highly so I thought I'd look it over. Cutting to the chase, I found it OFFENSIVE, SIMPLE-MINDED, rather DECEITFUL and conceived in IGNORANCE for reasons given in the other reviews."
5,Amazing Product,"This gel works wonders. Hands down the best mohawk gel ever. So strong it'll hold your hawk in place for days, even if you sleep on it. Washes out in a second no problem. Definitely buy if you care about showing off your hawk."
2,Not the best choice,"This book does not live up to its title ""Complete"". It does not give enough examples for different types of scenarios. It does not do an effective job explaining how to tailor a letter to different needs or addressing or defining legal concerns. That's what I wanted when I was looking for a book. Unfortunately, it was about the only thing on the market. I do like the way the book is set up; it just does not go into enough detail to be completely useful. This book is a start in the right direction but it is incomplete. If I had to do it over again, I would not have purchased this book."
1,Not the correct item,I received this supplement but it is not White Kidney Bean extract. It contains several ingredients including guarana (caffine in raw form). I am afraid to take this and I can't believe that Amazon sold it.
3,Didn't help,"I was somewhat confused that it didn't say White Kidney bean extract. I tried it. It didn't give me any effects. Yet, didn't lose any weight. And yes, I did workout while taking these pills."
1,oreder,Never got them and emailed once before to ask where order was. No nimber to call and talk to anyone either.Never ordering from again.
4,"If you're doing any print design, these are a must-have","If you're already familiar with Pantone formula guides, then not much is needed for a review of them. Basically, these guides are what you would expect from a Pantone guide. If you're not familiar with Pantone's guide, they are basically swatch samples of Pantone's color books, which help you achieve an exact color match when it comes time to send a design to print.While I'm sure plenty of people will scoff at the price, these guides are basically a must-have if you're going to be doing any print design for clients. Relatively speaking, the Amazon price for these is a great deal. They take the guesswork out of color selection, especially if you have clients who try to insist on a color based on who it appears on their computer display (which will often result in a disappointed client when the final product comes back from the printer)."
5,SIMUL8 'Bible' is excellent!,Excellent. Well written with a style and language that makes even the thorniest concepts accessible to anyone. The combination of a great software package and a manual like this makes complex simulating available to anyone who possesses at least some introductory understanding of activity flow and statistics. Usually I can think of countless better ways I would have explained a topic as I read through these manuals but that's hardly happened with this book. I highly recommend it!
5,The Ladybug's First Adventure in Reading,"This was the first chapter book I ever read by myself. It was a great adventure. It is about a family of black pioneers. I was sad in the beginning when I read that the Muldie boys' Mom had died on their way west. When they made their first friend out west, and learned to make a dugout, the story began to get exciting. My favorite part was when they made friends with a group of Native Americans. Later, the three Muldie boys traveled over a hundred miles on their own to find their father on his new homestead. I was thrilled to read on the back page that my first reading adventure was based on a true story. I would recommend this adventure to any new reader."
5,Wagon Wheels by Miguel C.,"You should read Wagon Wheels by Barbara Brenner and it is historical fiction. The Muldie boys and their dad were going to the West. They came to Kentucky to make their wood house. In Kentucky, it was a free land. One day the Muldie boys' dad went to find a new place to build a new house. It is a good book because the Muldie boys try to find their dad. It makes me feel very happy to read the book because it was historical fiction. I learned about the Homestead Act and I learned that you can help each other."
4,Interesting and informative read,"Readable account of the Orange County financial blow-up. Particularly interesting is the description of Robert Citron, the hapless college dropout who controlled billions of dollars of public money. Also fascinating are the prescient comments of the obscure accountant who ran against unbeatable Citron in the election prior to the disaster. Jorion manages to educate the reader, in a very painless way, about the institutions of the bond market (such as repos).On the minus side, the book is not particularly well documented (in terms of, for example, the graphs and the sources of the data) and some chapters seem suspiciously like lecture notes, hastily adapted to a book format. Still, an enjoyable trip to the dark side of financial market."
2,False Advertising by Manufacturer,"Hermell Knee Rest Wedge CushionIt was important to know what the height of this knee rest was, (as that is the most essential dimention for this type of product). Both the company's response over the phone and in their marketing states it is 11"" in height. However, when I recieved it; it was only 8.5"". When i called customer service, they took several days to tell me the 11"" was the height of one of the triangle's sides, but not the actual hieght of elevation of the cushion!!! They refused any sort accomodation for their swindle. At $50, (with shipping), for this piece of foam; Do yourself a favor and don't get ripped off like I was. Buy the other brand for half the price which is 10"" in HEIGHT. There are enough swindlers on Wall Street, we don't need it on Main Street too!"
3,Average Set,The Nylon items are quite good and so is the metal holder that comes with it. The problems lies with wooden utensils which are cheap and were damaged upon arrival. They are not smooth and quickly become worn. The checks or cracks in the wood have grown as to make the utensils unusable.
3,Better if animals were attached,"I purchased this for my 10 month old baby to play with as a quiet activity. I love the idea of all of the little animals, but for a young child, the shapes of the animals are not easily recognizable. Also, my daughter loves to just take them all out of each pocket. There are so many to keep track of. I would have preferred it if they were attached by a string or ribbon. Overally, she loves this product and it keeps her busy. I plan to attach the animals to the book myself."
5,Just an FYI,"We've owned this toy for over 3 years. The manufacturer (Pockets of Learning) replaces missing pieces at no charge, not even shipping!"
1,Not so great,I purchased this toy thinking it might be a fun and educational toy. I ended up sendingit back. It's hard to tell what animal they are. You can't tell what's what due to bad product design. My son did like pulling them out of the pockets. The toy would have been great if you could teach your child about the animals. I'm afraid it would only have confused my child when the animals don't look anything like what they are supposed to. I wish the product was better. It has a lot of potential.
3,Intresting info,This is a book that will take a while to understand. I was expecting more on the relationship between Ayuverda and numbers but it is very limited info on that aspect. But oeverall is good info to have as part of a library of books on similiar subject.
3,Why the letter switch?,"While I really liked this book's general content, I cannot figure out why the letters are switched around. The H & X are valued as 8 instead of 5, which affects the mathematical outcome as compared to all other letter charts I've seen. No explanation is given. This brings in some overshadowing skepticism that turns a 5-star into a 3-star. Granted, this could be some sort of method of Vedic Numerology, and I'm just used to Chaldean Numerology, but I'm still confused. Insight is appreciated."
1,depressing,"All the numbers had sad ,depressing words attached to them...........sorry , cannot recommend."
5,This is the track listing,Tracks are:1. Radio Quiet Storm Mix2. Radio Set It Off Mix3. Set It Off Dance Version4. Quiet Storm Club Remix5. Set It Off Club Mix6. L.P. Version
5,"Very portable, well-equipped","The LifeBook S6120 is very well-equipped for its price, and it's totally portable, with a travel weight of 4 pounds (with battery and optical drive). If you need 802.11g, you should opt for the S6120D trim, otherwise with the S6120 you get a very feature-rich and stylish computer for a totally good price. See my S6120D review for more details."
2,What is the point?!,"This book made me really mad. What is the point of it?! Taylor is in a BAND! A band is not one person it is 3 people. sure they are individual, but their main focus as well as mine is the music. I was disappointed when I recieved this book for Christmas, it almost ruined my day. Than I opened the OFFICAL Hanson bio, and that made me happier. Now that is a real book!"
2,not so good book,"This book had false info. On the test in the back, It says Taylor started taking piano at age 8, and in the text it says he started at age 5. The book also had info I didn't know but now I can't be sure if it is true. I would not recommend this book to others."
4,Taylor the dream guy girls want to know about,This book gives an insight on Tay's personality and his preferances. It is a must have for any girl who is gag ga for Ta
2,SEEN BETTER!!!!,"This book was pretty sad. I mean, all the pix were great, but the info was just so old and outdated. Plus, everyone already knew all of it basically. I think Nancy could of done a LITTLE BIT better."
5,If you love Tay than.......,"Read the book it has great pics of that hottie you know you love! and some useful info on that boyfriend to, so I suggest all you Hanson fans pick it up! I love you Tay :)!"
5,Great Buy...,I bought this pot on a one day sale and received it three days later in perfect condition. I have used it about five or six times and it has preformed every bit as well as my Le Creuset Dutch Oven at less than one-third the price. Very Pleased!
4,"~~~""WOW""~~~WHAT A POT!!!",This is the very first Cast Iron Pot I have owned so I cant compare it to the more expensive French lines of Cast Iron....This has become my pot of choice for soups and sauces...its wider then the French counterpart..and has the self basting lid as well...the knob on the lid does get hot..but no biggie..I just use a potholder....I ordered this in the Expresso Color..which is a rich and beautiful color and it stays on my stove top as its very very heavy! If your looking for a cast iron pot...give this line a try..you wont regret it!...I picked it up for only $59.00 here on Amazon...Great Deal...Great Pot!..Bon Appetite!!
4,Very Good Product,"Great Dutch Oven that does all its supposed to do. Maintains moisture while it cooks and has performed well for all my receipes. Very heavy but I will get uesed to it. I would recommend to all looking for this type of pot, it makes a wonderful brisket or pork butt."
3,Nice pan - HOT HANDLE & Hot Spots,"I think I'm a little spoiled in my kitchen. I have some Le Creuset Pans and love them, but not a dutch oven. So I got this for making sauces in. A couple problems, first, the lid's handle is Metal which gets hot - which accounts for the first loss of a star. The second star gone is because the heat distribution inside the pan is lowsey, I'm guessing the bottom is not heavy enough, but it's got a definately hot spot problem. And maybe it's only me, because I cook with Emerilware/All Clad pans, so I'm expecting simular performance.I'll definately continue to cook with it, and for the price it's not a bad pan, but if you have the money, get a Le Creuset. Better heat distrubution and a heavy plastic handle that doesn't get hot."
2,Good price - but low quality,"I have been using this thing for about 4 months. Really useful for making no-knead bread. One problem I have noticed is that there are little cracks forming all over the enamel. I only use it within the specified temperature range and it gets used pretty gently, so I am not sure what the issue is. Meanwhile, I have a couple of le creuset pots that do not have the same problem, I am not saying that justifies paying double the normal price, but if you are looking for something of equivalent quality, keep looking..."
3,Ed McMahon: Very little correct,"I can only hope the rest of his book is more accurate than that of his portrayal of Ed McMahon's military service.In a Snopes piece, this author is quoted by GI Jobs who used him to write about Ed.Where or from whom he got his info is not referenced so ..."
2,"A little better reception, fast delivery","Got the part very quickly, and it was easy to install. It only seemed to add 5 or so miles to where I can pull in stations."
2,"Good book, poor Kindle transcription","I refer to this book very frequently and find the information accurate and well written. Unfortunately the Kindle version has been very poorly transcribed, the font looks HORRIBLE, there are many spaces in the middle of words, and many strange symbols (also often in the middle of words). This makes the book very difficult to read on the Kindle, though in time it is possible to to work out what was actually written."
3,Shavings more like tiny chips,"I was a bit disappointed with the product. The shavings were very fine and tiny pieces some of it was so chewed up it was almost dust. For the price it's not bad at all but I hate how all the tiny pieces stick to my bunny's feet and whenever he leaves his cage he leaves a huge trail of wood chips everywhere. As for a next time, i'll probably pay a little extra for something with slightly better quality."
3,I made a mistake I guess....,"I'm not an aspen bedding expert. This is only the second bag I've purchased. I thought these were more like shavings. They have the texture of chips with shredded sharp edges. If I had to live and sleep on this stuff I'd be full of wood slivers. The last brand I bought was Harlan Sani-chips which was much more to my liking. They were wood shavings, softer w/o the sharp splintered edges. Looks like Harlan was just bought out so I hope the new owners are putting out the same product because I'm ordering a bag. I'm not buying another bag of Kaytee.11-28-11I'm going to suck it up and say that my opinion of the Kaytee litter has improved. The critters (dwarf hamsters) love to burrow into it and make nests out of it which they can't do w/ the Sani-Chips. So in the future I'll buy some of both since the critters give them both a thumbs up for different reasons."
2,"Huge price jump, lower quality...","Although I absolutely ABHOR other Kaytee products (specifically their foods), Kaytee is the best brand I have found as far as aspen bedding goes. It's soft and MUCH less dust than others. The quality of their bedding is a plus in itself, but the value of this 8 cubic foot bag is amazing! Even moreso because it qualifies for free shipping! Thanks to this, I don't have to spend $21 for a 4 cubic foot bag at my local pet store, and when working with 50+ rats at any given time, that's a big relief.------------UPDATE, 7/19/12 I have lowered my review to 2 stars, mainly because of a $6 price jump. I have to buy 3 of these at a time, so $18 more every time I buy is ridiculous. The quality has also faced a huge setback, I am seeing a heavy dust buildup from this bedding in my cages, something not found from this same brand just a couple years ago. Why am I paying $6 more for bedding of lesser quality?"
3,Really messy,"My only complaint about this product is, it comes in a brown paper bag that rips open very easily. It had puncture holes in it when it was delivered so the second I brought it inside it tracked through the house. I just emptied the bag out into a plastic bin so I wouldn't have to clean up the mess every time my son changes his guinea pigs cage. Other than that its a great quantity for the price."
1,Kaytee aspen 8.0 cf.,"Wasn't the right shred for me . It was like pine chips and doesn't last half as long as the pressed fine shred does. I'm just glad I bought two , won't buy again."
5,Good deal,"This is a BIG bag of bedding, easily 8 times the size of compressed pine shavings that sell for ten bucks in the pet store. It's amazing that this can ship free and be profitable. Good for us!"
4,This bag is huge!,"This stuff was shipped in a large box & inside is the brown paper bag with tons of aspen inside. The pieces aren't shredded small like the pet store here sells, instead they are shavings of a decent size. So far my guinea pig loves her bedding & I hadn't realized just how much is inside this bag till it arrived. With 1 guinea pig this will last me about 7 or 8 months. I put a layer of this on the bottom of her cage & a layer of carefresh on top. Works for us, even though aspen alone doesn't control odors."
5,Great value,"First off, let me say if you are looking for aspen bedding at a low price this is the only choice. This is a huge bag of product, this is going in a 6'x3' enclosure and it will fill it twice or maybe three times. The only down side that I could see to this bedding is that the pieces are a bit more coarse than the product made by Zoo Med, but it does seem less dusty than those products are."
3,"this is not 8 cubic ft, it's 4","I ordered this twice, for 8 cubic feet it is a great price. But it was not 8 it's only 4 cubic feet. I called several times to explain the mistake and was sent a replacement but they don't understand they are not sending the right amount. It's not at all a good price when you only get half of what you are supposed to. The bedding itself is okay."
4,"So far, so good!","I like this product. There was one small hole in the package, but a little tape and it was fixed. It is nice to have a large amount on hand."
3,I was really hoping these would be like shavings,"I own a Syrian long haired, aka Teddy Bear banded hamsterI was buying these to replace the pine bedding since scented wood has been known to be bad for small animals. It is bad for their respiratory systems and lead to other health problems.I was under the impression this would be the same only without the scent. I was wrong. This is rather chunky and actually got poked a few times by harsher materials in this bedding. My hamster doesn't seem to enjoy it either as he usually burrows in about anything. I guess I'll have to use another kind of litter that's safe."
5,An extraordinary book for every spiritual aspirant.,"Phyllis Krystal has written one more wonderful book to guide, help and educate every person on the spiritual path. Its a ""must handbook"" for every devotee of Lord Sai.This book gives us wonderful techniques and perspectives which will help every modern pilgrim in the journey of life."
4,it was good,The final ppv for tna for 2006 some matchs were good like the three way elemination it was stupid on how abyss was elminated first and so quick.Petey williams is a goood wrestler but was a fill in for chriss harris until the kayfabe eye injury healed but his match with james storm was good jackie moore debuts.
4,"Colorful, melancholy, and full of puns if you look.","i wish only to add to what has already been described. The ""Umbrellas"" theme become evident when I realized the characters were ALL searching for ""safety"" from the rain-Catherine's mother marrying for money and security, Catherine marrying for safety for her child and her future; Guy marrying for safety from his obsessions and loneliness. The ""true lovers"" are the only ones NOT married. Very heartfelt and well-acted."
4,"If You're Not Moved, Better Check to See if You Have a Pulse","I remembered seeing the film on TV when I was a kid and never forgot the theme music or the bittersweet mood. On seeing it again (on video in 1999), I was delighted, even overwhelmed by the cool jazzy music and wild 60s colors and the exuberant camerawork. Sure it's a bit corny, but it's so lovingly-made, so lyrical, and Catherine Deneuve is so cool, that I easily overlooked the flaws. Surprisingly, the all-sung dialogue works. Can't think of any other film like it, so for that reason alone it's worth seeing. Try to get it in letterbox. And have a box of kleenex handy. (Love the bit where she's six months pregnant and lights a cigarette anyway!)"
4,Unbox Download Version Not Subtitled Yet,"Superb movie. And DVD. As of this writing, however, the Unbox download version is available ONLY in French. No Subtitles of any sort. If you are hard of hearing and rely on subtitles, or if you do not speak (or sing ) French, do not buy the Unbox version of this superb movie. Maybe in the near future, subtitled domestic/foreign downloads will become available, until then ---stick with the DVD's."
5,Great Musical!,"I don't even like musicals! But this story is so romantic and I love the music and actors! There seems to be more depth in this story, not too much song and dance."
5,sound and scene cannot leave you!,"I have watched this more than ten times. Each time I am moved by the color and music in this movie. Each color metaphors each actor's feeling and enhances scene's atomosphere. There is one theme colour for each scene is you can enjoy it just by watching it. It goes without saying that the music is awsome. The theme song was pretty popular here in Japan also and it is composed pretty well. Refering to the topic, it is not only a sort of romantic love story but also we can see how one young woman lives. How the sociey went. Happily the army system was changed now! Well in the end I strongly recommend this movie."
5,The most romantic musical - opera? - of all.,"Through-sung - there's no spoken dialogue at all - with ideal casting (the young Catherine Deneuve is simply ravishing) and lovely voices (she's dubbed by a major French pop star, but you'd never know it) and the most romantic music (Legrand) since Puccini, this film is not only surpassingly enjoyable, it is unforgettable. I first saw it in its original American run in 1965 and my wife and I returned to the theater that same evening to see it again. I've had the original French vinyl discs for years and was delighted when it came out on VHS, though the colors were not nearly as vibrant as I remembered. In its new digital incarnation the colors are back in all their glory and the movie is breathtaking again. With American soldiers away from home now in seemingly neverending foreign wars, Parapluies has a new relevance. Or as Brecht said, Blut ist immer noch rot. See it."
3,Nice Movie...Pretty Music...Lousy Opera,"I enjoyed this movie. The characters were appealing, the story was relatable, the period style is nostalgic, I cared about these people. But, as an opera, it falls flat.In operas or musicals, singing's the thing. In this opera, what the orchestra plays is far more interesting than what the singers sing. Although a novelty, it would have made no difference if the dialogue were spoken or sung. That does not make a good opera.The constume designer had a similar problem--having to work around the wild colors and patterns of the wallpaper in the umbrella shop and apartment. Which is more important...the clothing or the wall covering? Which is more important...the singer's part or the orchestral background?Still, it was an entertaining and enjoyable film. The fact that it's an opera is meaningless."
3,Highly overrated,"This is a tribute to the sappiness of the early 1960s, a juvenile melodrama, wholly predictable, sung in French. The three or so Michel Legrand songs are beautiful, and they are hammered at you over and over until you no longer care.The actors should get much credit (the parts are extremely high), and the photography is good. Buy the CD and skip the soap opera."
1,Never received the package,"Same as the other two titles the package never got to me, most likely it was shipped all together in one box.How can I get a refound?"
1,A Total Snoozefest,"With the exception of taking another look at 'mod' sixties fashion, this lightweight combination of 'arty' photography and breathless Legrand music (Paul Muriat [Love is Blue] should have released the soundtrack, he would have been perfect) has nothing to recommend it.At least if you buy the DVD, you can turn it off. The first time I saw it, I was in a theater. Lots of others were leaving this 'acclaimed restoration', but I stayed to the end, trying to understand all the fuss.I'm still stumped to this day."
3,Okay Item,The product is as described and the most reasonable cost for this item.My disappointment is that all the special features are in Korean with no translation
3,movie fantastic --- DVD lacking,"I will not bother to outline why everyone with the remotest interest in the art of cinema should see this film. You can see the movie's imdb.com page for that.What I will comment on is the quality of the DVD transfer:- Sound is not great, but it is much better than the supposedly superior French release- Image quality is significantly worse than the French releaseThere is no satisfactory DVD version of this movie at present, but this one (Koch) is probably the best one around."
5,One Of My Favorite French New Wave Films,"A genuinely classic retelling of the boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy finds her again tale sung to Michel LeGrand's great jazz score. As another reviewer correctly notes, ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" is a movie operetta, set primarily during the Algerian War of Independence. The brightly colored sets have a definitive 1960's look, yet do not seem dated at all. The performances are all first rate, especially Catherine Deneuve's. If you see it at home, then you should purchase this VHS tape; however, it should be seen instead at your neighborhood revival film theater."
3,"not so great -- fluffy, slightly sad, grating music","the movie was ok, but not as great as i have heard -- best parts: the fauvist set design, the sweet characterization of the two protagonists, the performances of the two leads -- worst parts: legrand's melodies, the shallow depiction of the mother, flaws in the plot (why did he not write?)-- i'll confess: i fell asleep twice during the movie"
5,Stunning...a treat for the senses.,"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg may very well be the best movie ever made. Its a treat for the eyes (the colors are STUNNING. The cinematography is beyond amazing), and the ears (the music-the movie is all sung-is fantastic), and the cast lights up the screen. The new letterboxed DVD has a great letterboxed transfer, and brand new subtitles (although they can be turned off.) Its worth every penny! END"
5,"Great, solid product","When I replaced my stereo, I also replaced in after-market adapter kit. This one is FAR superior to the much more flimsy product it replaced. It's solid, allows for pocket on top or on bottom mounting in some vehicles, and looks professional.I have a 2001 Mazda B3000 (Mazda branded Ford Ranger), and it fit perfectly and holds my heavy deck securely."
1,Look and Feels cheap!,"I purchased this install kit to replace the factory stereo on my 1997 F150 XLT. It almost made it into the correct place before breaking! The install kit is plastic, and adaptable for different vehicles. Maybe that is why it is so fragile. The fit was poor, leaving gaps at the top of th plate. I should have bought a more expensive install kit!"
5,Love of a nightingale,I also have never read this book but my college is staging love of a nightingale i think that timberlake wertenbaker writes with such poise this book cant be missed.The play love of a nightingale is in a greek style but the plot is so intriging that anyone who previously thought greek tragedies boring will be proved wrong this one keeps you reading. i should know as a college production being forced to pick a greek play we werent pleased we must have got the best one possible brilliant to stage brilliant to read this book is a must if u are considering staging a greek production dont send ur audience to sleep liven them up with philomele's urging desire to know about sex and when she wishes she didnt. If the rest of this book is as good as love of a nightingale its worth it.
4,"A valuable guide to those entertaining ""the work.""","From looking at the reviews here it seems they love this book or hate it. As someone outside of ""The Work"" and who is collecting data to make a decision to delve into the work I may have a more objective view. This is the second book I've read on ""The Work"" and have read one more since. This book seems to accurately (although briefly) portray ""the work"". There are plenty of names dropped in this book as Kathleen explores the ancestry of the work and gives plenty of information on current groups. One tidbit I took away was about the value of the practice of the daily review. By reviewing one's day at the end of it this strengthens the practice of ""Self Observation"" as being a delayed observation of self."
1,Very unfavorable opinion,"A trivialization in the presumption of simplicity. Speeth's parents were involved in the Gurdjieff Work. She wasn't. She met Gurdjieff as a child, but this book only indicates the shallow surface of the ideas and practices he expressed. This set of ideas is not called ""the work"" lightly. Speeth seems to have no clue what that means. If the actual writings of Gurdjieff or the highly recommended ""In Search of the Miraculous"" are too daunting to begin with, try Jean Vaysse's ""Toward Awakening"" as an introduction that is at least connected with its subject.--I am not entering my name because I do not wish this to sound like self-promotion, not because I do not stand behind this opinion."
2,If only they would arrive in one piece!,"These are really nice - substantial weight, classic design, functional. The white is a slightly blue-ish white - not at all creamy (if you've been looking at a lot of white dishes you'll appreciate the distinction). The problem is that the manufacturer or distributor doesn't pack them with enough care. I ordered two sets to try them out before putting them on my wedding registry. Both arrived with broken bowls. Then I ordered replacements and one of those arrived broken. So, after calculating that I'd have to field up to 32 boxes to get 8 intact place settings, I gave up. Fortunately Amazon is very good about returns for broken merchandise..."
5,How beautiful this placesetting is,"I only have some of the casserole dishes like this,but oh my wish would be to have this dinnerware,very nice and durable tableware.Joyce,SC"
2,A little Bulky,"This item is very bulky,you have to measure your chest size first before buying because the actual product will not be able to close, it said in the description that its for adults but to me its more for children."
2,Too Small !!,"I bought an adult universal size and and adult oversize. I have a 50"" chest and the oversize wasn't even close to fitting. It was about 8"" short of fastening. I'm hoping the universal size will fit my 10 year old daughter."
2,not for kayaking,"I just got a kayak and was looking for a pfd. I didn't realize that you need something that isn't padded on the lower back. This vest make sitting on the kayak seat uncomfortable. It is a decent vest, just not for kayaking."
5,It Worked!,"Got it for a snorkeling trip. I can't swim! but ventured out into deeper water, thanks to the life vest.."
2,THIS IS NOT AN ADULT VEST,"The description of this vest as an ""Adult Universal"" size is totally incorrect. It just barely fits my 14 year-old, lightly-built son. It's almost ok for him with the bottom three straps expanded out, but the top (non-adjustable) strap is tight. Having a non-adjustable strap on top is a design flaw. The thing is, I actually bought this for me. I consider myself an average build 5'8"" man. It does not even come close, top strap or expanded bottom three.The construction quality and looks are fine. The two star rating is not for either of those items. The two star rating is for a size description which does not remotely resemble reality and a non-adjustable top strap which limits the poorly described size range even more. If you need a vest for a preteen or a lightly-built under 5'6"" person, give it a try, otherwise consider larger alternates."
3,Romantic,"A different kind of romance. Not sure they'll be together in the end, but they make you want to watch the journey."
4,"Finally, African-American love on the big screen!","After all this time, I still call this one of my favorite videos. It has all the culture, romance and innocence that no one knows that we have. Nia Long and Larenz Tate blew up in this film; though they didn't get their props. I believe that this left a mark in the mind of the target audience as one film that respects and celebrates Black Love."
5,one of my favorite movies of all time,"i saw love jones when it came out in 1997. i loved it and still love it so much i felt compelled to write a review of it even after 2 years. this movie was excellent. it showed excellent examples of black relationships. since 1997, i always list it as my fave movie and recommend it to everyone and will do the same in years to come. if you haven't seen it, rent it, buy it, borrow it...just see it....you'll love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not Bad At All,It was great to see Chicago look so beautiful in this well told love story. I hope we get more movies like Love Jones. The DVD is a wonderful edition to my collection.
5,Black Love on the Screen is Needed More,i really enjoyed this film.i liked the Chemistry of Nia Long&Larenz Tate.i feel Tate is very underrated.Nia always gives a solid performance.and she looks good as well.it was refreshing to see African-Americans doing well and Living like any other Human Being.that alone makes this film Genius.good direction.Bill Bellamy was cool in the film.the Poems were hit&miss but overall great film and very underrated.
2,A couple you don't root for,"A young woman decides to test her man's devotion by telling him she's going to an old boyfriend for a few weeks. Apparently she wants him to get upset and forbid her. But he plays it cool and lets her. The result is a year long separation. Eventually they get together again. But I didn't root for them to make it this time, because they are just so childish and annoying. Why would they play a stupid game like that with each other?"
3,O.K.,I watched this movie about four times before I could begin to like it. It's still not one of my favorites but it does showcase admirable performances by both Larenz Tate and Nia Long.
3,There's More To Love Than Sex,"I watched this movie a few times, and I enjoyed most of it. It's supposed to be a current version of When Harry Met Sally (I watched a few clips of the movie, so I don't know the whole story...it's written on the DVD that's how I know). Like I said in my review for Love and Basketball, Sister Act 2, and A Raisin in the Sun, I love it when African-Americans/'black' Americans make connections to us (Africans), so I love the movie. The only things I don't love about this movie is that the couple made love too soon and Larenz Tate's character mentioned the word 'rape' in a poem he wrote his love interest so I took back the DVD. On a lighter note, the actors had great chemistry and I love the poem that Nina (the female lead's character) recited 'cause she still loved her love interest. It's on my ipod. For the reasons I mentioned above, I'll remove two stars."
4,great love story,i felt as fof that it has happen to me as the characters played on throughout the story. I felt i was well written and the ending was great.
5,Cozy,Love Jones is one if not the best romantic movies of all times.A great movie to watch on those stormy raining day when you and you significant other just wishes to stay in the house.Larenz Tate along with costar Nia Long adds an Oozing meaning to the word Love and the Desiring need for that special someone.
5,Great Movie,I have always heard great things about this movie and put off watching it until a few weeks ago. Great story line and acting. A must see film.
4,Classic but Modern Love Story,Classic but Modern Love Story. Still love it as much as the day it previewed!I bought it for my sister and she hasn't stopped watching it yet!
5,Great.,I got my movie in a short amount of time and watched it repeatedly. No glitches in the DVD at all. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's just very cool.
5,I got Love Jones!,"Love Jones is another movie I saw in the theatres, I loved it! It is a good movie recommended for lovers along with the other great love movies from the late 90's. Good love story made enjoy watching Love Jones:)"
5,One of the best in my book.....,"I love this film, I love this soundtrack- I think it is on par with Pretty Woman as one of the best love stories. Not only did this movie help 2 really good actors shine. I fell in love with the plot, storyline- the only thing wrong with this move is that its not longer- I want to see ""where they are now"". Did i mention I LOVE THIS FILM- ok good :)"
4,"Romantic, Smart and Sexy","I love this movie. Grown up. Romantic, sexy love story. Urban. Intellectual. Poetic. Musical. Humorous. The chemistry between the two lead characters is really evident. I love the soundtrack too."
5,I've got a Jones in my bones!,"What can I say about this movie that has not been said? This was one of the best love stores (next to Pretty Woman) that has ever been made. If you have not seen this movie, you need to purchase it now, lock yourself in front of the television and don't make any plans for the next two hours because it WILL NOT disappoint! Enjoy!! NEO_SOUL_06"
3,Function Useage,"I purchased the Carving set for functions. The set itself is wonderful but, do not plan on using it for anything on the lines of prime rib or larger as the blade length is too short to get a balanced smooth cut."
2,Very overpriced and not worth it...,"Got this book as a gift for my son and although it's cute, he has zero interest in it. My son LOVES books and can't get enough of them but he has never liked activity books at all and this one in particular is very boring. The price tag is a joke, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I would pass on this unless your child is VERY interested in activity books (there are a couple of flaps to lift and that's pretty much it)."
2,Not functional for little fingers!,I was very disappointed when this item was received. The pieces are too small to be manipulated by little fingers and also will be easily lost. It is expensive for what it is--especially since it won't work as intended. I should have gotten the teddy bear with better manipulatives!
3,Cute but a bit overpriced,"This book is very cute, and despite other comments I found it to be well made. My son is not real interested though but maybe he will later on. I just think that it doesn't have enough pages and interactivity for the price you are paying."
3,Cute but Not worth 35 dollars!!!,"We got this book at our baby shower. It is a soft cloth book with a zipper to close it and keep peices inside. My daughter is almost two now and she plays with it on occasion. Using a small stuffed bear you go through the bed time routine. Glass of milk, bath, brush teeth, say your prayers, kiss goodnight etc. I really wish the book had a cord to attach all the small pieces to it. We lost the carton of milk and the soap. The toothbrush is attached by a cord but I noticed it fraying. The toothbrush is really the only part of it she uses. Which has been helpful in getting her brush back and forth instead of just chewing.I really never thought about this toy much until I was browsing amazon for toys and I saw that it cost THIRTY FIVE dollars!! There is no way that it is worth that much money. Buy your kid 6 or 7 board books instead."
4,wonderful,"I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I'm not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid. The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy."
3,Ok for people who say good night prayors,"This is a cute, interactive book made out of fabric. It walks you though the night routine (1. Drink your milk, 2. Brush your teeth, 3. Take off your clothes, 4. take a bath, 5. Put on pajamas, 6. Bedtime story, 7. Say a prayer, 8. Lullaby and goodnight) - works well for praying people - unfortunately, I bought it for an agnostic family!"
4,durable book but wish pieces were connected,"We bought an earlier version of this same book from a yard sale. It is still in wonderful shape and my daughter has loved this book from age one to her current age of four. She loves putting teddy in the bath, in and out of the pajamas, etc. The teddy is connected to the book by a ribbon, but the pajamas and other accessories are not, and are easy to lose unless you only unzip and read it under adult supervision. Otherwise, it is THE best bedtime book we have ever bought."
5,Theodore Tugboat - Big Harbor Bedtime [VHS],this vhs is good for the age 5 to 10 years old kids to day will love this tap so buy it today before it goes was for good..ps why because this is a VHS tap and VHS taps don't make no more.
2,It is a good book but having old information.,I found this book good but the information in it is looking old. Specially the tree chapter is bit old. Also try to include programming exercises along with examples.
5,impressive academic work that's easy to read,"This academic work is of a high standard. It Brings out of the mist the work and thoughts of Gulen. He is a remarkable individual who serves others through different activities, particularly in these difficult times where Muslims and Islam are so misunderstood. Of speacial interest to me was the paper by Thomas Michel. I look forward to a greater analysis and research into his interfaith activities."
4,Not the book you would think,"I have gone through half of the book (intend to read the other half as well) but its not the book I thought it would be. Its more of a story of the middle east politics over the past twenty years, the afhgan war and pakistan's involvement in it. Tonnes of information from personal encounters of the author and through his friends and acquaintances. Not your typical bed time book, a bit difficult to digest."
1,Don't be fooled by the title,"This book has NOTHING to do with its title, which was no doubt cooked up by the publishers for post-911 marketing. This book is bascially a Washington Post reporter's memoir about stuff he covered in the Middle East, plus a lot of tedious inside baseball that probably didn't make it past the Post editors."
1,Only useful for the pictures,"Not nearly as vital as the inside cover proclaims, this book lacks in-depth information. Overall, it gives you very little useful info on the various breeds. You get a breed history snippet, very generic temperament description, and information like size and coloring. If you want in depth historic and breed information, look elsewhere. This book is only useful as a pictoral guide to common breeds."
1,"read the review from ""A Customer""","Please read the review offered by ""A Customer"" for a finely detailed refutation of this book's assertions about Daito Ryu and Aikijujitsu. Frankly they were very generous in giving the book three stars with that glaring egregious blunder. What makes it particularly galling is the fact that Westbrooke and O. Ratti are senior aikidoka with years of experience but have not done their homework on their own art. So in turn what else should be questioned?"
5,GREAT INSIGHT INTO FEUDAL JAPAN,"GOOD BALANCE OF ARMS, ARMOUR,EARLY COMBAT FORMS THROUGH TO TODAYS MARTIAL ART STYLES. IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN BUDO THIS IS A GEM OF A BOOK. I PURCHASED IT THIRTY YEARS AGO, MANY STUDENTS HAVE ASKED ME FOR A COPY. RE-PRINT SOON PLEASE"
4,A fine example of thorough research and great writng.,"""Secrets of the Samurai"" is the a great book for both the marital arts history novice and the expert. It combines excellent writing with exhaustive research. The book chronicals the development of Japanese martial arts throughout Japan's turbulent history. It provides not only exstensive information about the many kinds of martial disciplines but also about the political and social context in which they developed. It is also fascinating to read and to look at, having many excellent illustrations. This book is perfect for the military history buff or anyone interested in the martial arts"
3,More and less,"This book can be viewed two distinct ways. It may be the most thorough book on Japanese martial arts mind control techniques with some interesting sections on the nature of those arts and their origin thrown in to flesh it out. Or it could be an average book on the development of the martial arts of Japan with an in depth look at the mental aspects of those arts included. I tend to favor the latter interpretation, but I am not as interested in the practices of the arts themselves as I am in the origins and nature of their development. Judging this book relies heavily on what one expects when reading it."
2,Windows Media Player,"If I receive an email with a photo attached, I cannot view the photo. I was hoping this book would tell me what I need to do.There were only two pages on setting up photo libraries. I still don't know how to do it."
1,Microsoft should be punished for Media Player,"Windows Media Player is a dreadful, moronic product. Whatever possessed them to reject the common user interface of every other issue of their OS for this inscrutable interface is unfathomable. It appears that envy of The Mac OS was the sole reason to make such huge incompatible changes. I don't know anyone who has made the effort to figure out how this pile-up works.At any rate, the moment is over. It is now time for Microsoft to get a clue about their viewer which did not sweep the world with its popularity, and return this awful, aggravating piece of junk to the common standards of the greater MS OS."
3,Lots of balm for your buck :),"This is a large lip balm (15 ml) that spreads softly on the lips. The packaging says that the active ingredients are organic jojoba butter and vitamin E. Not evident from the packaging is the extremely sweet lemon scent of the balm! I feel like I'm smelling a lemon Push Pop. It's not exactly cloying but could be annoying on an upset stomach or an early morning. I didn't have anything seriously wrong with my lips so I can't speak to its restorative effect, but overall this is a good quality lip balm."
3,It's OK,"let me start of by saying I LOVELOVELOVE suki products and try just about everything i can by them... this stuff is good, but doesn't keep your lips feeling moisturized. it's definitely a 'matte' lip balm finish as another reviewer said.. i cant see it at all in the mirror after i apply, and no matter how much i put on, i can't really feel it on my lips. I prefer something else for lip protection that keeps my lips feeling soft. but hey! it might work for you."
1,Not what I expected,"I've never used Suki lip repair butter and so I'm hoping I just got a bad batch, but it did not go on smoothly and did not moisturize my lips at all. In fact, it seemed kind of pasty. I was hoping for a very rich lip balm. My sister has used this in the past and only had good things to say so I was surprised and disappointed."
4,so far so good,"So far we like it, first one didnt work and took quite some time to get here so we had to wait another week for replacement but its working good now, says full set of batterys will last 10,000 uses we shall see im counting them ! lol"
4,$129 for a surprisingly compact yet sizeable recycling bin,"This is not a bulky can at all but it is still able to handle a week's worth of plastic recyclables.After two months, the lid kept opening up by itself so when the batteries died from all the extra action, I did not replace the batteries."
2,Careful with the free shipping,"The product is far too big for a home usage. It was a mistake to buy it. When I tried to return it, the shipping cost was half of the product price!!! So don't be fooled by the free shipping when you want to buy, 'cause if you want to sent it back, you have to pay it."
3,Not 528 Pages and No Flashcards,"What's here is very good - it's a ""cliff's notes"" version of the Odom QoS Exam Cert Guide, more or less. It skips a few key points here and there, but for the most part covers all of the main points, succinctly but thoroughly. It is, however, short - 40 to 60 pages would be my estimate - this is perfect for being a quick guide. The description, however, claims a length of 528 pages, and the book itself claims to be the flashcard edition. Obviously an ebook isn't going to include a cd-rom, but it wouldn't have been difficult at all to have included the flashcards. So long-short good stuff, easily worth the cost, but not what's described by any means. If you, like me, wanted the flashcards (I'd heard they were very good for tests prep) you'll have to keep looking."
1,Garbage,"This thing stopped working about a week after I put it up. I used it inside for a hall door. So it was never even outside. It's garbage. Don't waste your money, just buy the good one first."
5,Very Satisfied,Very satisfied with this product. We have a long driveway and the Driveway Patrol notifies us when someone comes upto our home.
3,very sensitive,"A little too sensitive,but works good,bought to replace one gone bad,would rather it buzzed or rang than playing music,but acceptable"
1,Does not always beep when cars go by.,"The monitor does not always pick up cars that come up our driveway. Yet, sometimes it beeps when the dogs walks by. Not sure whats going on..."
1,Fork out a little more for something better!,"I purchased one to monitor my driveway. First of all, it doesn't have nearly the 400 foot range that it says it has. Also, if the sensor or reciever is placed in a metal building it will cut the range down even more. Lots of false alarms. My sensor was mounted to a fence post and I even built a three sided box around it to try and lesson the false alarms, but that hasn't helped much. You get what you pay for, so spend a little more and get something that works."
3,Needed Sensor for Drive,This sensor is a great idea but the motion picks up other things besides someone coming down the drive. I live in the country and the buzzing on a windy day drove me crazy.
3,Works OK,"Works OK for a few days, but runs out of battery power too quickly, lots of false alarms, even with side blinders added."
5,Driveway Sensor,The Driveway Sensor is just what I wanted. Now nothing comes dowm my driveway without me knowing it. I'm very plesed with the Patrol Sensor!
1,Defective Unit,"The on-off button does not function properly. Seems not to work like my 1st one. Very bad unit, But I think its defective."
2,poorly made,The unit I received is much to inconsistent. Sometimes it works othertimes it does not. Its as if the sensor goes into sleep mode. I was trying to use it indoors to alert me when someone was walking into my office and had it set by the entrance. My office was about 25 feet away and behind one wall. Would not recommend this product.
2,Not for us,I didn't like it -it didn't work as it said it would. Sorry to say that but I'm sorry it didn't as we needed something like this.
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE,This is a PIECE OF GARBAGE. Pure consumer RIP OFF. It does NOT work the way it's supposed to work. DO NOT BUY IT. I purchased plenty of stuff from Amazon and this is the ONLY product that I HATE. WASTE OF MONEY.
1,Died.,"I was very pleased for about 19 days.About 4:30 AM the sender went into 'alert' every 4 seconds. Wrote to BigFly Sports via Amazon. I wondered why I did not hear back. Checking at Amazon, they did not give this site an accurate email address so my query bounced back. I didn't realize this til the 30 day return period had passed.Out $25 for nothing.Avoid this product and Stay Away from Big Fly Sports."
5,great sensor!,I am using this to sound an alarm whenever my 94-year old mother gets up at night and goes out of her bedroom. It is loud enough that she turns around even when sleeping and goes back to bed. And when this doesn't happen I can come arunning.
1,Quite disappointed,"Bought 2 of this unit to notify me of entries into my side gates. The first sensor malfunctioned after the first week and continuously went off for no reason. The second unit sensor simply stopped working after three weeks. All in all, quite a waste of money!Driveway Patrol Infrared wireless home security alarm system - Home and Garden > Security"
5,Great Product,The Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit is great and works well. I feel it is a little over sensitive and will pick up leaves blowing down to drive sometimes. I built a little box with a open front to help keep water from getting inside but it says it's water proof. I was surprised for the price how well it does work!
3,you know someone is there,"This device definitely lets you know when someone is there, whether it's a person, or a lizzard, or dripping water. Aside from being very sensative and VERY, VERY LOUD, even on the low setting it does work and is a good value for the price. I've gotten in the habit of turning it on when I'm expecting someone and at night, otherwise I keep it off."
1,DriveWay Patrol,"After 4 days both units quit running. I tried unsuccessfully replacing batteries, but found out thats not the problem. Initially the units were both operating great,but they both stopped signalling on the 4 days use.Buy this product and be Sorry."
1,Many false alerts,"I've purchased three of these over the years in the hopes on them finally working correctly. I'm sure many reviewing here have found these false alert quite often after writing their reviews. Every one of the three I've had false alert several times per day. Not as much at night but it's pretty bad when you hear it, grab your gun and find out nobody is there. Pretty annoying."
1,Driveway Patrol Wasted Money,"Purchased this product after being impressed with the claims made on the outside of the box. Easy to install, alerts you when someone enters your driveway, no wires. Well, I installed it, about fifty different ways with countless new batteries, with tape on the lens sensor, three feet above ground, four feet above ground, 400 ft away, 300 ft away, etc. The thing never stopped chiming, it doesn't work. The only thing this product alerted me to is don't purchase products marketed by Telebrands."
4,False Alarms,It is great and does a good job. The only thing is that I can't use it because my neighbor 2 houses down has one and his and mine goes off together. No matter if the motion is at my house or his all of them go off at the same time. Driving us crazy so had to take the batteries out of mine. Is there any way to lower the receiver distance?
2,Not Great,"Not that great of an item. It goes off all the time. I have to turn it off at night, before i go to bed. I wouldn't buy another.."
3,low quality,price isn't bad..didn't like the color because i use this at nightand the white color sticks out like a sore thumb...i ended up putting black tape allover it for concealment..works most of the time.. but fast moving vehicles will sometimesget by it without triggering the alarm
1,Throwing money down the drain,"This is a worthless item. Yes it will alarm when you take it out of the box and pass your hand in front of the sensor. But useless as a Driveway Alert. False alarms, no alarm when it should, very short distance only and constant battery drain."
1,Works for a couple of weeks only,"I got the Driveway Patrol kit to use as an alert to let me know when my cats wanted to come inside. I set it up at the front door at cat height and after a few adjustments to narrow the range so that it only picked up the cats when they were right at the door, everything was great - but only for about 2 weeks. Then the alert went off and wouldn't stop. I tried other locations, I tried changing all the batteries, I tried adding tape to the sensor, I tried removing tape from the sensor, heck I'd have even tried reasoning with it if I thought it would do anything. Nothing helped, the alert just wouldn't stop sounding. In the end I gave up and returned it. I ended up gettingThomas & Betts RC4610 Battery Operated Wireless Motion Activated Chimeat a local brick and mortar store instead and that's been fine."
1,Do not waste you money.,"Outdoor sensor only worked when cars were coming to the house, never leaving. Indoor sensor quit working completely after only 1 week. Terrible product."
1,crap,What a surprise! It's made in China! This has no sensitivity adjustment and it becomes totally unreliable. Ours kept going off when the sun would come out from behind the clouds so we added masking tape as instructed until their was only a tiny opening remaining down the center. Because we can't depend on it I am now returning to amazon to shop for a decent model.
1,Worthless waste of time and money,"This unit worked when tested inside my living room, but put outside, about 60 feet away from receiver, responded about 1 out of 5 times, for two days, then quit. I went through several new batteries on both units, and put the receiver in the direct line of sight of the sensor, and nothing.... silence.Junk. Battery-sucking, time-wasting junk."
2,So-So,Have been using this for about one month. Overall I would suggest you consider buying one of better quality and saving this money.Does not work well in cold or rainy weather - overall is not reliable - will at times pick-up a dog walking past but does nothing when the UPS truck pulls in!! Will pick-up a white car but nothing dark in color.
2,"rather not have it, than have it",Sensor will not pick up motion of a vehicle moving at normal speeds along drive way. Plan on installing speed bumps at sensor location to slow down traffic. Product has added an additional worry rather than eliminating one. China wins again...
4,Driveway sensor,"I got a bad one! It don't work. Had to order another one and hope it works when I get it. I ordered one years ago and it wore out after 5 yrs or so. Hopefully, I will get a good one this time."
1,NOT A GOOD ONE,IT SHOULD HAVE NO STARS BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE LET ALONE A FRIEND THE BUNKER HILL ONE IS ALOT BETTER ONE.
4,Mixed Emotions On This One.,"This product is very sensitive to all movement: wind, birds, leaves, etc. I tend to turn it off because of the false alarms. We may have them placed in wrong positions. I would not say don't purchase. You might not have the trees that create false alarms. I would rather be somewhat protected as not being at all. I like the fact you can move the receiver around the house with me. Could be a life saver if someone is trying to break in your home."
3,have not used it yet.,I think it will work well. I really needed a system for outdoors. Although sensor is for outdoors; receiver must be in-doors.
3,Patrol Sensor,"This product was recieved in the estimated time and in good condition. Under a different situation, I am sure that it would work just fine, however, because the head of our driveway is about 300 ft. down hill from our home,the monitor doesn't receive the signal. We will probably use it out at our lake property, which is on more level ground."
4,"Good, despite the other comments",I think this product is great of you have a small area to protect. Mine is on the fence and faced where people standing at the gate trigger it. I do have a few false alarms mainly rabbits on the ground easily eliminated with a piece of tape 1/4 of the way over the beam. It has been great and alerted me every time. The battery life is about 3 mos. I have not had weather issues with it and its out in the open. I have not had it go through the winter yet so I may update this by spring. I don't have my dogs out all night so this is great for night time. Been great!
3,I expected more,I purchased this and placed it right next to my driveway and it has not worked very well. It is not sensitive enough and there is no adjustment. Cars drive right by it and it never goes off.
2,Driveway Patrol Sensor & Receiver Kit,The item is malfunctioning after a months use. The receiver comes on and won't stop. I changed the batteries but it didn't help. They say it has been too long to return it. Bought it in November.
3,So So Sensor,"Works OK most of the timeBUT!! It get set of by direct sunlightsometims and does not pick up COLD metalfrom vehicles, especially at night"
1,Manufacturer Quality Problem,"I bought one of these about 6 years ago and it worked just great. A month ago I purchased a second one, and it arrived defective. It keep going off every 3 to 8 seconds. I returned it to Amazon and ordered another unit. It also arrived with the same defective symptoms. With 2 units behaving the same way, it appears that the manufacturer no longer tests the units before they are shipped. I am glad that Amazon takes these units back with no hassles."
1,cheaply made,"looks and feels cheaply made. It doesn't really work with the batteries. I bought an AC adaptor for it which made it work for two months. Now, it won't stop beeping. I'm gonna try a different product."
1,Worked for one month to the day!,"I was very pleased at first with this product... Then it stopped working. I changed the battery thinking it was very soon for it to need changing, but had no other options. Changing the battery did nothing. I was very dissappointed also to find that I could not return it because my time of one month had lapsed that day!I guess you get what you pay for,nso I will look for an option that had more life. Even though it was only $17, I hate to lose that money in this economy!"
1,not much,"I have purchased two of these and had to return both, the first gave false signals, returned it, got a replacement, the replacement would not do nothing, it never picked up anything. I returned it to amazon ask for a refund, I have about 26.45 in these things this includes return postage tha i have to pay, and still have nothing. I don't seem to have any luck on getting a refund either. I would not but any item from this company ever. I will rate the product and the company at a -0"
5,Alerts someone on their way downstairs in my area,It works beautiful for having the sensor on the top step and the reciever on my PC desk with me-alerting me at variable tones-someone is on their way down rather then me be taken by surprize.I have another sensor on the front step-alerting me that someone is at the front door where I can't hear them knocking nor pounding the heck out of the door downstairs-enables me to greet my expected guest promptly as they trip the sensor before the door bell or a knock with the reciever chimming as the sensor beam was broken.
2,Piney Flats Failure,"Don't waste your money. Many false alarms and lasted only one month. I changed batteries and it still will not work. Very, very short life span."
2,Don't waste your money,"This product does not work at alll.,, I spent 2 hours trying to calibrate and the thing kept beeping whenever.,,"
2,Be prepared for many many false alarms!,"I purchased 3 of these (like an idiot). Of all the products I purchased from Amazon, I regret this purchase. I placed them on my porch, patio, and mailbox. FYI, the one in the mailbox didn't work as the signal wasn't strong enough to signal the receiver. I have followed the instructions including the ""tape trick"" and still get false chimes. Even placing the sensor in an area that has no movement including wind interference and still receive bogus chimes. I moved them several times with the same result. It seems that even sunlight reflection in the afternoon causes them to activate? These are very unreliable. They do not have a control to adjust the sensitivity like a motion floodlight, etc. After hearing the chime so often I became desensitized. I got so aggravated I stopped using them and plan to return! Ok, time to write more (positive) reviews ;)"
2,Irratic,"The item chimes off for no reason. No trafffic, no one walking by, no car in the driveway...it just starts chiming. Would not recommend."
4,Great Sensor,"I like this sensor. It has a nice chime and it is good at detecting motion. It is however, very sensitive and picks up things that are blowing in the wind. Perhaps this is unavoidable. Overall nice value for the cost."
4,nice unit,"The unit works fine wish you could have different sounds, so you could have one in the front drive and also one for the back. Other then that so far good buy for the $$$$."
1,the patrol is dead,"the item was purchsed january 2010. the system does not work in march 2010. only static ,no chimes.. do not purchase this item."
3,It works but....,"Bought it on Amazon. The pick up pattern of the outside sensor is weird. It misses the mail carrier on our mail box next to the front door, but triggers on someone walking by on the sidewalk. Also triggers on nobody at all (a squirrel maybe?). I tried pointing it down but does not help. My wife leaves it turned off, so it does us no good. The design and feel looks real good. Maybe if you can orient it exactly right, or put white electrical tape over the lens to limit the sensitivity it could work, but I have not been happy with it so far."
1,Sucks,Bought this for my husband for Christmas 2009 for him to hear when paper man shows up. Worked for one week. Sucks!
2,This worked great for a week or two,"When I set this up it worked like a charm and I was very pleased with my purchase. When it stopped working, as recommended by some reviewers, I placed it inside a cozy birdhouse where it would be protected from the rain and wind. It worked a few times after that but then stopped working again altogether. It was great while it lasted and it is indeed a bargain for those people for whom it functions as intended, but not for me."
4,driveway alarm,"product works as stated ...have bought 4...in all,,, i use them as an indoor alarm system......the receiver will receive signals from all 4 ...i just don't know which station is sending a signal... at additional cost u can get a dc adapter 4.7 volt as is.. the units work on one 9volt and 3 c type batteries...... GREAT BUY.... shipping is slowwww"
2,driveway sensor,I was a little disappointed with this since it is only line of sight between transmitter/receiver. It will not work for what I wanted but I'll find some use for it.
2,"Worked great, then stopped.","I've ordered 3 of these over the past year. Now, only one works. The receivers all still work, but the 2 of the sensors have been scrambled somehow. One of them won't stop beeping when you put the battery in, the other doesn't ever beep, even with a fresh battery. There were a live saver at first, allowing me to work in the office, and know when customers came in into our tasting room, but now they're going in the trash, after less than a year."
2,Drive Way Patrol Sensor Gives Alot Of False Warnings,I have tried to move this sensor to several locations and it continues to sound off for no reason. It gives off alot of false alarms.
2,False Alarms,"Great idea, but like some others have said I have had problems with false alarms in the heat. Seems like an interesting product, but doesn't work to great in the Las Vegas heat."
5,Reliable Device,"This device works exactly as advertised. The sensor is very sensitive and picks up any moving person, car or object within it's range. I have been impressed with the way it works. I have it monitoring the entire front of my house. Nothing gets within range without me knowing about it. EXCELLENT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT!!!"
5,Affordable motion sensor,"Wanted an affordable way to tell when my kitties were at the back door waiting to come in and I found it. Set it up at the back door and it lets me know right when they want in. The transmitter seems to have no problem reaching the receiver placed inside the house through a wall. The receiver also has two volume settings which is nice. The low setting is actually low enough to not scare my kitties once I let them in. I ordered another to put on my front porch where my tomatoes are. Hopefully I can catch the critter that keeps digging through the planters they're in. So far, highly recommended, espectially for those looking for a ""trainingless"" pet door bell."
4,It works well,I bought this item thinking it wasnt gonna work but it did and it works very well. I installed it in my driveway so i know if someone is coming and i can get a heads up before they show up on my doorstep. You also have the options of turning off the reciever when you dont want to use it and it has a high and low volume setting but the motion detector cant be turned off you can only unplug the battery and thats the only way to turn that off. Only bug that it has is that when birds fly across it it goes off sometimes and gives you a false alarm but other than that i recommend this product to anyone.
2,NOT HAPPY,ordered two of these .... one came broke ... I'd have to pay to return it and its just not worth my time and effort
4,works great,"I have the sensor where I park my car since I have had it broken into and it gives me peace of mind. I needed to put a mock bird house around it because it sensative to leaves blowing, but it works great after I did that."
3,Driveway sensor,The sensor does not always work when cars drive by. It does seem to catch dogs and wild animals...this I don't understand. I watch the sensor as I drive by and rarely does the light go on. Looking for a replacement.
2,Not reliable,"Don't waste your time on this. Some days, it doesn't go off when a vehicle drives by it. Some days it does, but also goes off randomly."
3,"Works as described, but...","This unit works as described and is sensitive, but - after only 2 weeks the quieter of the two alarm volumes stopped working. The quieter setting is very loud, but the louder level that is the only one that works now is downright jarring. We found the volume of the alarm so obtrusive that we have stopped using the unit."
1,Did'nt work,Ordered 3 to help warn of feral hogs in yard at night. Two of the three did not work. Poor quality control.
1,Totally unreliable,"Installed it in the evening, and it seemed to work fine. Next day was surprised to find that it had a very hard time detecting anything. Sometimes waving my hand directly in front of it would trigger it, but that was about it. I read some other comments about hot outdoor temperature being a factor, and it is summer time in southern California, so maybe that's it. Totally useless for me. Avoid."
1,Device is worthless,"Device does not work more then 10% of the time. Even set up on a table, when walking past, chime fails to sound 90% of the time. I should have payed more attention to the poor reviews. Complete waste of money. Do Not Buy."
3,Driveway Patrol,"I ordered the Driveway Patrol to watch the driveway and garage whenever we are out back on the patio during the summer months. When we first installed it, it worked just as we expected. Well after our neighbors saw what a safety feature it would be they all decided to purchase their own. That is when the problems started. The neighbors all installed their own Driveway Patrol for safety. The only problem now is that the Driveway Patrols are all on the same frequency and they cannot be changed. In other words, when one goes off they all go off and you are always getting up to see who is coming into the garage."
4,Serves my purpose pretty well,"I bought the driveway patrol to do exactly what it is named-patrol my driveway. Before I got it, people would drive up my driveway and I would not even know they were there until they knocked on my door. Now the ""ding dong"" alerts me unless they go past it too fast. Took a little time to adjust sensitivity so moving trees and bushes wouldn't set it off. Well worth what it costs."
4,Driveway patrol Sensor works great,I had purchased one years ago that finally died. The new ones I purchased work even better than the original one. The new ones are less sensitive and don't go off when the wind blows the nearby bushes. We have a long driveway and it's nice to be warned when someone is coming to visit. Since we live in a remote area it gives us a greater sense of security at night.
1,Boo- don't waste your money!,"I purchased this product, despite some of the reviews I have read. It worked twice and has not worked since. I guess you get what you pay for----> junk."
4,Does the job,The price was right. Read the otherreviews re limitations so I knew what I was buying. No bells or whistles
2,Not Great,The items stopped working after three months of using them. I ordered two of them and neither work any longer.
2,can't use it,"good quality, reasonable price. Problem is I cannot control the sensitivity other than taping over areas on the sensor ""eye"", but even after doing that it still picks up passing cars that are on the street over 75' away. The ringer only plays a ""dong, dong, dong"" every time it rings. I use this in an office to signal the door opening, and it would be nice to have one 'ding' or one short 'buzz' or some other less-annoying chime. I will stop using this for the above problems, and look for something else with some options."
1,Unacceptable,"My problem with this product is that it has delayed reaction. The target has to do at least 25-30 sec. Kabuki dancing in front of it for sensor to kick in. It might be good for a cable guy writing you a love letter, as one of the reviewers below describes, but even a jogger will be able to run circles around your house without ever being spotted, leave alone a car illegally parked on your driveway. Returned it for free with no problems (thank you, Amazon!) and bought more expensive Skylink HA-434TL Long Range Motion Kit - works like a song!"
4,Works,"I use it in my shop to let me know when people come in. The little red lights never worked. I've only tested it up to ~120ft, the signal travels through several lath and plaster walls and a thick brick wall, allowing me to work outback while minding the shop. It serves my needs well."
4,Keep alerted,this product works well enough but the range advertised is greatly overestimated. if it had the range advertised it would be even better but it does work for the purposes I need to alert me to somebody coming up the driveway
1,USELESS to the nth degree. . .,"Purchased this item, installed it per instructions and began testing. The chime unit was originally approximately 8' from the sensor unit and would NOT sound an alarm. I kept moving the chime unit closer to the sensor unit in order to find a suitable place to hang the chime unit permanently. Finaly, at approximately 12"", the chime unit was able to pick up the signal from the sensor unit. A complete waste of time and money. Too bad I had to give it even ONE star."
1,Constant beeping; can't even use it.,"I just received the Driveway Patrol and inserted the batteries. The alarm in the receiver goes off constantly and won't stop until I shut it off so there's no way I can even test it to see if I can use it. I even tried putting the box over the top of the driveway unit and the receiver still beeps continuously. It will stop for a few seconds, then continues beeping. Very disappointed. Sending it back."
3,Driveway motion detector,"The Driveway Patrol does tell us when a person or car passes in front of it. But it also tells us if waving branches in high winds or frisky squirrels jump in front of it. We have narrowed its scope to 1/8 inch and trimmed nearby shrubs but still get about 4 false alarms a day (never at night). However, I think the times it is actually monitoring are worth the slight annoyance of the over sensitivity."
4,Good product for price,"this product was easy to set up, we got it mainly to know when someone showed up to pick up the kids. It is a little too sensitive at times, so we usually leave it turned off and just turn the switch on when we are expecting company so that we are alerted when they arrive.For the price, its a good buy."
4,Does exactly what it says...,"For the price, it does exactly what it says and does it well. I get advance notice (via beeping) that someone is approaching the front door and garage. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but works great!"
4,Very good product,"Working is very well, but fails in the hot day time.In the room, works excellence. Anyway, this is a good product.I would like to recommend it for indoor using. Thanks."
4,Takes time to get right but then works well,"I spent several hours over three days getting two of these to work right. One, over the driveway, I had to use quite a bit of tape to restrict the IR sensor coverage. It appears that the one thing is that it still has a tendancy to kick it off if there is a rapid sunshine to cloudy conditions and this seems to be my only current problem. This cloud cover with the fairly high temperatures right now in late spring is making the IR sensor sensitive. The other sensor which is over a grassy area has no problems and required no tape. Both work excellent at night with no false alarms BUT they pick up the wildlife passing through the yard, which I want for possible night photography and to see if the deer are eating up our plants. We turn them off late at night when we go to bed. For the price they are hard to beat, but to get them working correctly, you need to spend some time with them and that is stated in the instructions."
3,Woks most of the time,"I live on a busy road, but have a long driveway. No matter where I place the Driveway Patrol Sensor, it picks up the passing cars. Also, there is no volume control. It says ""low"" and ""high"" but even on low, it is still pretty loud."
2,Very disappointing,"We have a gated driveway, and I purchased the Driveway Patrol to let me know when a car pulls up to our gate. Unfortunately, everything sets the sensor off, even the movement of a leaf on a tree. I tried putting tape on most of the sensor window as it indicates in the directions, but it still goes off all day long. This might work well to detect motion inside your house, but I still haven't gotten it to work correctly in the driveway where it is intended to go."
1,nasty piece of junk,"Worked OK for about a day and a half, then it would go off every few minutes for no reason. Changed batteries several times, to no avail. Changed position in case squirrels or cats triggered it. Moved it from place to place, even watched the scene, and still sounded the alarm for no reason. This is a piece of junk that will drive your dog crazy. !!! AVOID !!!"
1,Quality has gone downhill,"I originally bought the driveway patrol about a year ago and it worked great for about 6 months. Then after it rained several times it stopped working. It was not in a very sheltered location so I decided to buy another one and make sure it was covered. That unit only worked sporadically - the sensor LED would go off but the alarm did not always sound. I had waited too long to return it, so eventually I bought a third unit and that one had the same problem. After reading the return policy I would have to pay the return shipping and they will only repair/replace it and at this point I don't want to keep throwing money at this product since it seems the build quality is extremely poor."
4,good for border security as well as simple early warnings.,"these are a bargain compared to ""the reporter"" (3x the price) as they work as well. you need 9v rechargable nimh batteries for the infared portable sensor (but the base can work off a ac adapter not supplied)to go along with the purchase imho so as not to get clobbered with battery replacement costs. also if you like more range ....take them apartdrill a hole and pull the wire antennae out and let it dangle to get 500 ft. range. amazing. you can buy multples of them for border intrusion security. only downside is that winds stirring branches can give false cues. cheers......"
3,freezes up in cold weather,"This item is much more suited to warmer climates. I installed the Driveway Patrol last night here in Vermont. Outside temp was in the teens. It worked great while it was still warm.Later in the evening my son drove out, setting off the alarm... which failed to turn off!! After retrieving the transmitter unit, and warming it up inside, it worked again.I am now using it inside, near our main entrance, and it works well there. I just will have to wait until spring to use it out in the driveway where it was intended.The price was too good to send it back. I will improvise for now."
3,Good deal for the money,"I mounted it to the back of my mailbox so I don't pick up street traffic and also know when the mail is delivered. My old one had a very loud volume so put it in a cabinet, and this one has two volume settings on the switch so can mount it in a better central location.It did have a few false alarms maybe due to the cold temp in the 20's so after 5-10 minutes of beeping it's it stopped and now only beeps when people are coming and going.I had one years ago which worked well and this one for the first few days works well so far.If I run into any issues I'll update this."
2,average at best,"I found the units to be hyper-sensitive at first and then in less than 30 days, 1 of the 2 units stopped functioning all together. Not worth the postage I would have to pay to return the unit for replacement. Lesson learned...""as seen on TV"" is only seen functioning for :30 or less. With that as the standard - it worked."
4,"Works Well, Easy Setup",Installed on the side of parents' carport to cover their back door. With a little duct tape on the sensor I blocked out pet traffic zones and side to side motion areas. It works pretty well except for a real problem with sun/shade changes. Aimed at a brick wall it kept triggering until I figured out the change in heat on the wall from cloud movement was the problem. Had to place it so the sensor viewing area was in constant shade.
1,not for the out side area,this product is ok i guess . it works fine but i thought i am getting some thing for my driveway . but this product dose not work in the rain . i think it's only for the inside .. mine worked for only a week after it rain it stoped and didn't work . so if you getting it for the out side thing don't get this product my friend
2,Typical Made in China durability,"I purchased the Driveway Patrol and it worked well enough, although it would never alarm for my daughters VW Beetle for some reason? Anyway, it worked for exactly one year - now I have a non-functioning unreliable ""made in China"" product that I'll probably just throw away. Buyer Beware!"
1,save your cash,"Hello I bought this item thinking it would be great just to monitor my driveway. I installed it and after some tweaking I had it working great. No false alarms, had a car pull into my driveway and it went off well. Next day, it went off when my paper boy dropped off the paper. Great. Then, about 9 this morning it started going off for no apparent reason, and kept going off,didn't stop. I unplugged the batteries and reinstalled them thinking it would somehow reset but no luck. Just threw it in the garbage. Not worth returning because it was only 10 bucks and the shipping alone wouldn't make it worth it. Basically you get what you pay for. KEEP YOUR 10 DOLLARS AND DO NOT BUY THIS> IF I SAVE ONE PERSON FROM BUYING THIS, I""D BE GLAD I WROTE THIS REVIEW>"
1,you get what you pay for china junk,we bought 2 one for our buisness drive and one for our private drive they all have the same freqencys.you don't know which one and where.If your neighbor has one also your alarm going to go off when his goes off they say there FCC aproved thats a lie or they would have what channel there on.buy 2 off harbor freight for $4 more they send you 2 different channel ones as I said cheap china junk.
1,Buyer Beware - HUGE SAFETY HAZARD,"SEE MY COMMENT BELOW... I MADE A MISTAKE IN USING THE PRODUCTThe receiver uses 3 AA batteries. However, the battery compartment was NOT designed properly. Much too big for AA and with a stiff spring...meaning that the batteries slip to one side with the slightest jarring. The spring then shorts the end of the battery. The battery overheats rapidly. And you have a melt-down. I am glad that I caught it in time! Wondered why the receiver felt very warm. When I opened the battery compartment, one AA have melted is entire label and was too hot to touch!Other than a fire hazard, the product works good!"
4,Works pretty good for the price,Alarm went off every 15 to 20 munites the first day or two never could figure out why after that it settled down and works great. The alarm is very loud even on the lower setting. I would buy it again its great for the price.
1,WORST PRODUCT I EVER BOUGHT FROM AMAZON,"If you look at my reviews, they're generally good/flattering. This thing? GARBAGE. I have had it beep or ""BING-BONG"" (thrice) NUMEROUS times in the past ten minutes - because of a MILD WIND. Branches move. It's mounted in a driveway (i.e. WHERE IT SHOULD BE). It goes off 200 times/day.HOWEVER - When my DODGE RAM QUAD-CAB comes up the driveway: NOTHING! It SOMETIMES works on our Toyota RAV 4. We shut it off. Its a JOKE. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. GARBAGE. :( I want SOMETHING - however - that WORKS! Going in the trash.-J"
1,"Will try item,, ""AGAIN"".","I can not give an accurate rating on this purchase. It has been in use for less than 30 days, (replacement item). However,on the first one, the sensor,(transmitter),went south,(Mexico, Isuspect),after less than 60 days in service,and that equates to me,,less than one (1) STAR... AND, if I didn't need it, I wouldnot have ordered a second unit.Feedback on(2nd)replacement item,it has lasted around 90 days,and it too,went south.I have 2 excellent receivers, and 2 trashed transmitters. ""SAVE YOUR MONEY""."
1,Driveway Patrol Sensor,I went to install it today now that we finally have some good weather. The product appears to be DOA (Dead on Arrival). It looks like the remote sensing unit works as the red led lights upon movement but the receiver doesn't work. I tried two sets of new batteries and event the an external power adapter still no go. Trying to get a replacement. It looks like I need to pay for return shipping.
5,Works Almost Too Good,"This product works great. Just be sure and place it as high up as possible. When I first installed it on my porch, the range is so good that it picked up every passing car on the street, and the neighbors in their yards! It will pick up birds flying by as well. I put one on each end of the drive, and one in the garage. One chime works for each sensor you have."
5,very pleased,"This is a great, inexpensive product that actually works. I have a neighbor who sneaks into my woodshed and steals my firewood. With the As Seen On TV Driveway Patrol Infrared Wireless Alert System, I am notified when he gets close to the woodshed so I can let the dogs out to bark at him. The only downside to this product is that it alarms when my neighbor's cat comes into the field, and I would rather the dogs not chase the cat. The batteries last a surprisingly long time."
2,Too Quirky,"Everything under the sun sets this off. Wind, a leaf blowing by, rain, snow, who knows what. I set it up on a light post in my driveway to detect cars coming in and it does that but way too many other false alarms. I tried taping up half of the lens and still no luck. I got what I paid for- cheap. Looking for something more accurate."
2,wish I saved my receipt!,"In the beginning, the chime worked maybe 40% of the time, and now not at all. I bought this to keep my cat out of a room and a flashing red light with no loud chime does not deter him at all. Waste of money...definately going with another brand next time."
2,Richard D,"Although I do feel this item would be effective in some situations such as areas where there is nothing like animals ,trees, nearby traffic, that would set it off unfortunately my situation wasn`t a good one for this motion detector and I did go ahead and buy a under ground ""Mighty Mule"" system that has worked great for my situation."
2,worked great for only 27 days,"I use this INSIDE ONLY, for a pet. When she goes to the back door and wants out it should go off so no matter where I am at in the house, I can let her out when the alarm goes off. Worked great for 27 days and now it goes off even when no one is near the sensor or it doesnt go off at all."
1,this sensor stopped working after two months,This sensor stopped working after two months and since it is past the return policy date I can only gethalf my money back and I have to pay return shipping. Warning this product is not worth it.
2,works when it wants to,"this thing is driving me nuts, the instructions that came with it were just about putting batterys in not about how to place units sucks"
1,goes off all the time finally shut it off stay away,goes off all the time even after adjusting about ten different times stay away...not worth the money at any price
2,Good product if it works,"We ordered two of these to detect wildlife in the garden. One worked, one did not work. Looks like a 50-50 proposition. You may need to order two of them to get one working unit."
1,Doesn't work sensor never stops activating,"Bought this to give me a heads up when someone drove or walked into my driveway. It does work however the sensor seems a bit too sensitive. It is either picking up on the small trees blowing in the wind in my neighbors yards or it is picking up on the cars that drive by, because the bell goes off every 15 minutes during the day until about 6 PM. After that it works whenever someone walks through the driveway or drives up.Not sure if there is a way to adjust the sensor I'll continue to try and move it around until whatever is causing it to go off so often is no longer in the sight of the sensor but until then I'll have to stick with the 3 star review because frankly I can't turn it on until after 6 and expect it to work right.Update: Can't get it the sensor to work properly. So it is useless. Don't waste your money on this product. It goes off even in a room where nothing is moving. This needs to be pulled off of amazon."
1,Faulty product,"Product ceased working after 1 week. I've replaced the batteries, but have decided that malfunction is with the product itself. I guess you get what you pay for. I'd recommend saving yourself the $20 for something else."
4,Quite Useful But Has Its Limitations,"I originally bought this off the shelf at Fry's. Liked the first one so much, I bought a second. Having said that, it does have its shortcomings. For instance, it gets set off by lots of leaves moving on a tree during a wind storm. You also have to be cognizant of exactly what you want to detect to be sure it detects that type of object and not others, such as, pets moving down low versus humans. Actually my biggest complaint is that it only has two sound levels for the alarm and the lowest is normally too loud for my preferences. It would be nice to have a more graduated volume control to fit your needs. I'd even pay another $5 or $10 for the feature. As an overall product, it probably only deserves 3 stars, but given its level of usefulness for its low price, I gave it an extra star."
3,Not too sensitive and the alarm is not very loud,"It does sense approaching people and vehicles (and animals) most of the time, but you must have the alarm very near to hear it."
4,Not 100% reliable,"I got this for my hubby as a gift. He wanted to know when someone entered our driveway before they rang the doorbell.It works pretty well, but sometimes goes off for no apparent reason (birds? squirrels?) and occasionally will not sound when it should. But works most of the time.The alarm is plenty loud to hear around the house.A fair deal for the price."
1,Too sensitive,"This unit is much too sensitive for me, it picks up birds and half the time it goes off it is a false alarm."
1,Less than one star,Absolute waste of time and money. I installed this on the front of my garage to catch anyone coming up the drive. My daughter backed out of the driveway in a 3500# car and it never went off. False alarms every couple of hours. It woke me up twice the first night before I turned it off. WARNING ON THIS PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY. It's coming back Amazon.
4,close enough to perfect as possible,"First one we got over 25 yrs ago went off without reason. More current ones don't. We have had them last 10yr in the Florida sun, heat & humidity. Well priced also. We have one on our patio pointing to the back door and front door. Can be used indoors also. The two volume levels are nice but indoors it is too loud so I put a sock over it to muffle it."
1,Disappointed,"We had one of these Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit and it lasted for years. However, this one did not last two weeks. Quite possibly moisture was the problem and it failed shortly after a very hard rain."
5,DriveWay Patrol,"The Driveway Patrol is an awesome product. As noted by previous reviews, the product works better when insert within an enclosure and this narrows down the beam. You can use several (all on the same frequency) to alert you at differnet points at your location and being battery driven. It's an excellent buy.The only thing that would be nice is if you could adjust the frequency for the different areas. That way, you'd know if Zone 1 or Zone 2, etc. is being triggered.Overall, for the price it's a great buy, I recommend it highly."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK!!! GOOD THING I ONLY PAID 16 DOLLARS FOR IT. WAY WAY TOO MANY FALSE ALARMS!!! IT DROVE MY WIFE CRAZY, SHE WANTED TO SMASH IT. I WILL BE THROWING IT AWAY. I EVEN PUT IT INSIDE THE GARAGE(NO MOVEMENT AT ALL) AND IT STILL SETS OFF FALSE ALARMS. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I UPGRADED TO A HEATH ZENETH MOTION SENSOR FOR 40 DOLLARS FROM HOME DEPOT AND IT IS AWESOME, WORTH EVERY PENNY. IT PLUGS INTO A LAMP AND HAS A VOLUME CONTROL AND A RANGE CONTROL. SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS."
4,Pretty good for the price.,"Worked for me. The only downside is that the chime is annoying, and the volume control only has two settings."
4,farmer market,The product arrived in good time. It was easy to put together and to attach the send unit to a tree in the driveway. This alerted us to a a car in the drive way that might need assistance with a purchase or collect the amount for their purchase.
5,Really Great Product,"I bought this product to prevent backyard intruders. I love it, have had no trouble with it, it performs as advertised. It is easy to use, a couple of batteries and ready to mount. The receiver has two volumes and I can hear it in my bedroom and it can be heard loud and clear in the backyard too. I am so glad I found this product, my friends have all asked where I purchased it."
2,Sucks nuts,"It works just about half the time, but the other half any object can pass through it without it alarming. Very unreliable....also sucks nuts"
2,O.K. But not for me.,"Inexpensive and fast delivery.I shut it off after being awakened the 1st night by 4 false alarms! I installed it as per instructions but it picks up every thing. I live in a wooded area with lots of wildlife, it appears that squirrels, birds and the like set it off as well as nocturnal prowlers like raccoons and deer. Might set it up inside the house and turn it on only at night. Guess you get what you pay for."
2,"the siren box did not work, motion box did work","only half of this device worked, have one already from another comp..it work fine...but this one from this seller, only the motion box worked"
1,"High ""False Signals""","The unit did nothing but give false alarms every 10 seconds.Troubleshooting with the manual suggest applying tape to narrow the beam.The receiver also may experience false signals due to ""wireless routers""...etc.The sending unit may give false signals in direct sunlight.I ended up taking the unit apart (since it was money lost anyway) to see the inside.No way to adjust the sensitivity of the unit was noted.Save your money and avoid this product unless you want to install it for the blinking red L.E.D. for people to see."
2,Good Units are Rare,"I purchased two of these units through one of Amazon's online vendors known as AsSeenOnTvGuys. This company has a bad reputation online for leaving customers nasty email messages with a lot of profanity, and by not honoring their products. These guys also advertise on eBay a lot, and they make up their prices by charging outrageous shipping costs. When you purchase from them, you think that you are getting a good deal due to the cost. But when you see your shipping charges, most of the time it is double if not tripled the cost of the product. The Driveway Patrol unit itself is ok if it stays in dry environment. I just had one of my two go out by sounding off constantly, and I have only had it about 5 months now."
2,"Not Reliable, any tricks?",My driveway patrol worked okay for a few days then stopped sensing cars as they drove past. Does anyone know what I can do to get it working again?
1,Disappointment,The product is virtually worthless.....After making all possible adjustments the devise is totally unreliable. I would really like to get my money back because the thing is already in the garbage!
2,Not exactly what I intended on using it for... but OK,"I didn't have great luck with this item for what I had originally purchased it for. I would not recommend this to anyone looking to use this for outdoor security purposes. I tried using tape, as it was suggested in several reviews, but I still ended up with too many false alarms in the middle of the night. I think bugs must have been to blame, after a lot of testing and lost sleep - I ended up purchasing motion sensor surveillance cameras. I sleep much better now. Though it didn't work as I had originally intended, it does work fabulously indoors. I put the sensor in the hallway outside my daughters' rooms - I know when my 3 year old is about to come down the stairs. No false alarms indoors."
3,Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit,It's an okay product but it would have been better if it had a ac adapter that came with it.
2,wasn't what I wanted,it only had a chime no alarm. But they were nice when I sent it back...the description was pretty vague...
2,Don't recommend for most applications,Too many false alarms. I live in the country and it goes off too often. Birds will set it off. Would be fine in places that are not open to any traffic but only a visitor or prowler. Hard to find a good location.I don't recommend.
2,Alarms so often that it is worthless,Followed the directions but the alarm goes off every few minutes for no obvious reason which makes it truly worthless. There is obvious demand for a product that does what this item and other more expensive items claim but they all seem to have significant faults. Where have all of the American inventors gone? Perhaps someone in China is reading this and will design a better product since they make everything that is sold in this country anyway.
2,Good wind detector,The Driveway Patrol has a serious problems with false alarms. I have enclosed it in a bird house to protect it from the sun but every breeze sets off the alarm. My motion sensor lights include technology that prevents false triggering by wind. I suggest that the manufacturer incorporate this feature and they would have a real winner.
1,did not work,"I don't mind if something cheap I buy breaks in the first week or two. But when I buy something cheap and it doesn't work ever, now that's a waste of money! This was a waste of my time and money."
3,FALSE ALARMS,"It works perfect at night. But during the day I have to shut the item off. It sends so many false alarms its annoying. Birds,leaves,limbs,cars on passing street, I mean everything sets this thing off during the day. But if you are concern mostly about dusk-dawn time. Then its a great investment."
2,Driveway Sensor Update to Review,"Updating my original review of this item. This is a handy product and worked well for the first 2 months. (changed batteries then 2x). I did not use it during the Winter months much due concern for moisture. Then when I started using it again recently, it required constant battery changes (weekly) or it would beep loudly (you can hear it outside) continully. With the price of batteries, I found it prohibitive. I asked for an exchange for another one that worked, and the seller would not comply (according to policies). However, I did feel that it is under 1 year and they could have replaced it. Due to this I will not buy from this particular seller again. This is the first product I have had this experience with and I order frequently from amazon. Thanks."
3,"Works, with some modificafion...","This thing drove me nuts at first but I finally got it to work correctly. If you don't put a shade over it, even the clouds passing overhead will set it off. I had to tape down the sensor only leaving a 1/4"" opening and put it inside of a box so the sun didn't hit it. If you put it anywhere it gets hit by sunlight (even indirectly) it will gop off constantly. After the tweaking, it is woth the price, but be prepared to spend some time getting it to work right."
2,you get what you pay for,"It didn't work for me, constant false alarms. Will work indoors at about 20 feet!"
4,Driveway Patrol Sensor...,Seems to work fine so far. Especially considering the price. It is a little sensitive to wind movement but that is not a serious problem. Better placement would help I'm sure.
1,Part time security,"The unit doesn't catch every vehicle coming into my drive, therefore, there is a false sense of security and that can be a very dangerous thing."
1,Doesn't work correctly,"We get false alerts when no one is there, and works only @ 20% of the time when someone is there."
4,Nice Gadget,Arrived on time and nice price. It was packaged well and met my expectations. It gives a sense of security.
1,didn't work,"had one of a different brand had for 4yr work great thought i would try this one because it was cheaper, didn't work would not recommend at all, i returned mine. no problems with return."
2,False Alarm,"After reading all the other reviews I felt confident purchasing this item. After placing it on a post at the end of our drive I quickly found out it was too far from the receiver. I moved it about 60 ft closer on a tree at the bend of the drive. Still it wouldn't pick up anything, finally I moved the receiver into the front bedroom in the window sill. That put the two components about 50 ft apart. Then it picked up almost everything including the wind but several times it didn't ""see"" cars that came into the driveway. My husband travels for business and is gone a lot, we live way out in the woods and our house faces the lake with the back facing the road, we have no neighbors and I thought this would be great to warn me when the rare visitor comes to call. You get what you pay for and even less with this thing."
1,garbage!!!!!!,"Save your money. This thing goes off constantly, even when nothing passes by it! I bought this to alert us if anybody enters near our garage at night. Turns out I was already ripped off when I bought this product.....typical Chinese crap!"
1,worthless,"Product never worked; was utterly useless and totally ineffective. I seldom write a review of products that disappoint me, but this item was something that I wanted to be successful. It is supposed to be an item designed to afford a degree of security: it fails in that regard."
4,Works great to let me know when someone is driving up the driveway,"My daughter is picked up by school van every morning. This sensor works perfectly in telling us when the van is here. When not expecting anyone, we will normally shut off the receiver because it picks up false alarms. The slightest movement can set it off. So in essence it does what it's asked to do."
1,"Cool, but doesn't work consistently","We love it when it works, but it doesn't always work. Also, the box says it can reach up to 400 feet. We had to place the two units about 150 feet apart to get it to work. I will not buy this brand again, but I will look for this concept as it's helpful for living down a long driveway."
3,Weather resistant my butt,"Bought this product, for the most part I loved it, it did exactly what I wanted it to do. However, this thing just weathered it's first rainy day and it broke...... Will be buying another non the less, it does not work as advertised. I live in San Diego, so weather is usually a non issue anyways but it failed it's first rainy day."
4,It's worth the $13 something I paid for and more!,The product worked as advertised. The sensor works on 9 Volts battery. The receiver can be connected to an AC outlet adaptor or by using 3 size D batteries. An idea when using an AC adaptor you can plug it to an electrical timer thereby selecting the time of the day or night when you want the chime to make the sound when someone comes across the sensor. I just wish they make something like this but with changeable sound like that of a dog. I recommended this product.
1,Died in 1 month,This died within 1 month of purchase. It worked fine up until then. (a little too loud imo)
1,Driveway Monitor,The Driveway Monitor I purchased did not work. Would notchime. I would not purchase this product again. Returnedit.
3,Better bang for the buck--But it has alot of bugs to work out,"I bought this thing besides all the negative feedback. For 20$ its much less than the 120$ driveway alarms. the volume is a non issue; If its too loud, put a piece of tape on it. the false alarms can be 99% eliminated and fix the real issue--moisture!! Put the sensor in a 10$ cedar bird house; This keeps it from getting wet and keeps false alarms low. And it hides it from people that would take and disable it. Small animals and windy days can increase the false alarms. okay for 20$, plus 10$ for the bird house (from Lowe's) and 2 cents in tape make a great buy. The range is not 400ft more like 300ft and only one door."
1,"Not worth the time/money, do a Google search, see 4 yourself","Purchased the first of these items just ten days ago. Once the unit tripped, it would NOT reset/turn itself off. Immediately returned it for another unit and experienced identical problem. Used the ""patch"" included with the unit (intended to reduce the range of motion detection) in both cases, both attempts failed to elimate the problem. Alarm was loud - as often stated in other reviews - but not a problem as the unit was tucked away in a room that often has a closed door.Our time is too valuable to waste playing with resistors and building unsightly shields. If this were a quality piece of electronic equipment it wouldn't be necessary to have to fix it in the first place. THUMBS DOWN, big piece of JUNK. Will upgrade to a more reliable product."
2,not pleased,"Seemed to work for a while, then it was beeping a lot and I'd look out my window and could not tell what has set it off. Then I'd watch a car arrive or leave and the darn thing wouldn't detect a car! I finally gave up and disconnected it."
3,review of driveway sensor,"I use it as a door sensor in my shop. It is not consistant, often I have people waiting at the counter without the sensor letting me know they came in. Works about 80% of the time."
4,Great for the price.,This is a great solution to let us know when someone is coming down our long driveway. Set up was easy and works well. We did have to place it about 4 feet off the ground to keep the wildlife in our area from registering. Great product for the price.
4,Great Alarm for the Money,"I purchase this alarm from my local farm co-op for about the same price on Amazon. I didn't think to look here until after my purchase. The unit is extremely sensitive and works in all types of weather, even at subzero temperatures. The problem I had with the unit was its sensitivity and found out the best way to correct the problem was to put in into a cedar bird feeder; not only did that correct the problem, it also gave the unit protection from rain and snow and hide it from view. It has two volume controls; one high and the other medium. Most times the unit is set on medium. Once, during the summer time, wasps built a nest in the cedar feeder that protected it, and it was going off constantly until I removed the nest."
1,broke down junk,doesnt work anymore. not sure why. alarm will not sound any longer. wouldnt recommend this to anyone. worked for awhile with ordinary use and now it wont work
1,Excessive noise,This is a good idea but it lacks a sensitivity adjustment. No matter where I set it it gives false alerts. It seems there was not much thought in making the product.
1,Shipping Charges Unreasonable,"Although this item has a good price for it, the vendor has shipping charges that total almost as much as the product itself. I was going to order multiple units, 4 to be exact, but the shipping was being calculated for each per unit, although they were probably going to ship them together. Add up your shipping before purchasing here folks."
3,"Works OK, but too good sometimes","The product works good and the price is very good, but it does false alarm too much."
1,This is product is JUNK...Too sensitive to be useful,"I bought this driveway sensor because I could not see the driveway. It goes off for too many reasons. I have not even identified all the reasons it alerts me. It is waste of money, I have found no purpose to own this alarm."
1,75% of these products are defective.,"Dear Sir or Mada'am,The Driveway patrol i anticipated in excitement for several days. I finally recieved on the fifth or sixth day, and when i attempted to use it, only the sensor worked. How did you not know it was defective when everybody else who got theirs said it was. I'm out thirty freakin' dollars all because of your inept product. I know it probably isn't your fault, but nonetheless researching the products you sell wouldn't hurt. Anyway i can't return it, because i already threw it away. 75% of the Driveway patrol sensors do not work, i googled it so i would know. There's not much else i can do or say, so good day to you.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,UnHappy Customer,"I bought this item brand new, the box was damaged and the item did not work, my experiance with buying my first item on line was not a good one ."
4,"it works, better if the receiver came with a DC adapter","It works, I use it in my front lanai so I know ahead of time who is coming to my front door.I would have given it five stars if the receiver came with a DC adapter. It will increase the price but in the long run it would be better than replacing three C batteries which are not readily available at least for me."
5,Excellent product & service,I have had a Driveway Patrol for several years and this is a spare. It came earlier than I expected and was at an excellent price. These things can actually detect a mouse passing by!!!
4,Driveway Patrol Sensor,This product works as described. The only problem arises from motion of adjacent trees or bushes when the wind blows.
1,you got to be kidding !,"I can't believe I even payed for thi thing. What was I thinking. It doesn't work at all. Except for the little red light on the reciever blinks,but no warning of anything crossing it's path.So do yourself a favor and look for something else"
4,A great unit that could be better with some modification,"My mother forgets that she can be unstable when walking, so I wanted a way to know when she was getting up so I could make sure she was safe. This unit has worked well. I can put it anywhere so that when she gets up and moves forward, the alarm sounds.But, the alarm is much too loud. Even the low level is too loud. And, it would be better to sound only once when something crosses its path. If something moves very slowly or stops, the alarm sounds over and over and over until the path is clear. If these two things could be fixed, this would be an outstanding product."
3,Driveway Patrol Review,"...Positives:1) Its cheap. Very inexpensive.2) It's short comings can be worked around.Negatives:1) Volume alarm setting on receiver has 2 settings. The low volume setting is still annoying loud.2) IR Passive detector is way too sensitive. Normal IR noise makes it intermittant outside. The False alarms make the unit unusable. Doing a google search, I find many people with similiar complaints. People who do not have this problem are fortunate.My work arounds for these 2 problems are:1) Opened the Receiver alarm unit and put a 1k resistor in series with the speaker. Volume reduced to a pleasant level now.2)I built a wood housing that surrounds the IR Detector unit with a opening protuding 8 inches beyond the unit. This blocked the IR noise and made the unit very stable :0)... Driveway Patrol Alarm system and the fixes were easy for me, I am happy with the product."
2,For 15$ item return cost = not worth returning,"Bought unit in July2011, failed in October 2011. For some reason the sensor sends alarm every few seconds. Light blinks and alarm sounds.Worked good for awhile every time someone passed it sent signal to receiver. It is light weight and I would not use it outside. For $14.00 with shipping it is a throw away unit. Return period is very short, you pay to return.Same unit is sold under a lot of names.Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit"
3,It's good and bad,"Amazon has these at a very great price. When I got mine and set it up, it worked well, very well, too very very well. It does what it's suppossed to do but the problem is anything that moves including birds, little animals like dogs or cats, squirrels and even branches moving in the wind will trigger this device. The key it putting the motion sensor in a place where NONE of the above will send out false positives which is hard to do."
2,NEVER BUY AGAIN,Sometimes they work and other times they dont.But you can expect them to work just fine when there is nothing there to set it off.Spend a little more for something else.....Also Volume button has no detent to know when its loud or soft but if in between you'll get nothing.
3,Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit,The units worked initially well. Yet within a period less than one month the receiver lost its voice. It seems that the alarm speaker was defective. I hope I can get a replacement.
3,Works ok... sometimes.,"I'm not sure if it's just overly sensitive or it just likes going off at random sometimes. I first set it up on the side of the house, facing across the driveway. But every time our neighbor walked to his car, it went off... even 15 feet away through thick cedar bushes. So I moved it onto a tree facing the house at a 45 degree angle. Everything seemed to set it off. So then I put it against the house further up the driveway where it couldn't pick up the neighbor. It seems to work good for awhile, then for no particular reason it will start going off at 3am one or two times. It's too high off the ground to pick up small animals; in testing it there, it only goes off for people or vehicles. Very annoying, we end up shutting it off."
5,"Denso (5303) IK16 Iridium Spark Plug, Pack of 1",Denso (5303) IK16 Iridium Spark Plug lowest price found easy to install shipped free arrived as scheduled. So far average mileage is around 38mpg in my 2003 toyota corolla S 5 speed with no problems or misses.
3,Iridium Plugs have not increased my fuel mileage/economy,"I bought a set of 6 for my Acura RL to replace the factory laser Platinum plugs. The first week after the replacement, my gas consumption increased from 22mpg to 20mpg. I attributed it to a cold spell that had come by in early October. The second week, it went back to 22mpg. I checked it this week and it has gone back up to 20mpg. I don't know where people are getting the improved gas performance from. I have not seen any difference between the 99k old laser Platinums and these 30 mile old Iridiums in performance, except that the Iridiums cost a lot more."
2,Denso spark plugs,"I thought these IK16 Iridium plugs are supposed to last longer, especially costing as much as they do, but they didn't. I just replaced them with NGK plugs that cost $2.50 each and they work just as good."
1,one star for Amazon's make-sure tool,"These things do not fit a 1995 Ford Ranger v6 3.0L (and probably many other year Rangers, I'd guess). Amazon's make-sure-it-fits-your-vehicle tool failed me 4 out of 5 times (one success, one failure that I recognized before making the purchase, and then three separate failures in a single batch order).Don't trust Amazon's make-sure tool."
2,disappointment,"I installed Denso Iridium IK16 on my Subaru..The center electrode pops up! Their theory that creates bigger flames doesn't support anything. No small light bulb could enlightened a bigger room.Do you know what I mean? Their presentation is not true.Of course bigger electrodes could create bigger spark and flames.This is piece of a junk unless they improve the size of electrodes. If you are looking for the best performer look for Bosch Iridium, their latest technology. Guaranteed, I 'm using it in my Nissan Pathfinder LE 2003. The outcome is amazing! Sooo good, it delivers above my expectations, secondly durability matters at all!"
