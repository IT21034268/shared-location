4,Great bluesy tribute,"A great recording with a really interesting mix of music. None of it is particularly country-ish, all of it is professionally performed and produced (probably thanks to ace producer Colin Linden).I particularly like the Folsom Prison cover by Blackie and the Rodeo Kings (of which Linden is a member), which has a kind of Rolling Stones vibe. Loud and nasty. Maria Muldaur's Walking the Blues is another primo example of her recent blues recordings, Alvin Youngblood Hart can make you cry with his version of Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down (by Kris Kristofferson originally, if I'm not mistaken).Another review here is down on Harry Manx's Long Black Veil, but I disagree. Cash's version was much countrified. This take is not the least bit ""Indian"", but closer to the Celtic tradition (see the version by the Chieftains featuring Mick Jagger on vocal).Sleepy Labeef is great on Frankie's Man Johnny, as is everyone.Buy it!"
3,Amway in cyberspace,The book is mildly helpful for people who want to sell Amway through its new facad...Quixtar. I joined Quixstar...same products different way of ordering..the internet...novel idea huh?The book to me is the same sales pitch hype that you get from the people selling the original amway idea.
4,good reference book,"this is like a dictionary for the Valdemar Series. Fine reference if you are new to this ""world"" & need it"
5,Valdemar,"Mercedes Lackey - that says it all. She's an extremely talented writer and between my wife and I, we own almost all her books. The Valdemar series is my favorite out of everything she's written. If you're the type of reader who likes to reread a book over and over again as the years pass, this book along with all the other Valdemar books are the ones to own. Do not pass GO, do not collect $200, as the old saying goes, until you add this book to your Valdemar collection!"
4,Very Informative,"I love the Valdemar series, even though I've not read them all. This book helped clear up some issues I found confusing. This book is a must have for Valdemar fans."
4,"Useful, if not exceptional","I picked this book up in a bargin bin, and I've actually found it fairly useful.As a casual fan of the series, I don't have an exhaustive mental index of who's who, where's where, and what's what. This book has been useful as a quick reminder to keep things straight, especially as things in the most recent books seem to slide away from earlier details.I thought the included novella was cute if somewhat incomplete given Lackey's usual eye for details.For me this was well worth the bargin price, and perhaps even worth the cost of a paperback, although I don't know that I'd have thought it worth the original hardback price."
5,For series fans,"THE VALDEMAR COMPANION is exactly what the title says it is, a complete reference book for fans of the series not different than many other similar tomes. It contains a glossary of names and places important to the Valdemar world as well as a synopsis of each book. Besides the standard articles on culture and people, this book also includes the unique element of a well-written novella by Mercedes Lackey, author of the eighteen Valdemar novels. Though clearly for the Valdemar mythos audience, fantasy readers in general will enjoy this companion volume.Harriet Klausner"
2,Less sturdy than expected,"Case looks nice, but very thin. This is a case for carrying to and from practice, but is too flimsy to carry on an airplane or use for any long travel."
3,Snack Food reading,"While the anecdotes Rowe relates in this book are entertaining enough, the treatment of them is very superficial. And (with the exception of the background into Captain Kidd) you don't get a sense of much historic background. In fact, Rowe likes to repeat popular myth about this figures that he knows to be false in a very confusing way, so that it's almost unclear that he knows it's false.The selection of folk tales and history ranges from the history of the life-savers to pirates to sunken gold ships to ghosts. An entertaining enough read for a vacation or a Sunday afternoon. Also useful as a pointer to myths and histories worth following up in more depth."
2,feminists will enjoy,"Yes, feminists will enjoy. But that is about all who will. I had to read this for a class. It does give some good information about artists, but most of the book is over-annalyzing and very over critical. It want's the artists to be very dirty old men who only think about sex when doing art. I think that it is a false commentary who many feminazis would enjoy."
4,Little Rabbit's Loose Tooth,"I bought this lovely book for my grandson after he lost his first tooth, but haven't given it to him yet at the request of his parents. Little Rabbit is pretty self-aware for someone so young. She is not sure if she is going to buy into the Tooth Fairy story. So if you want a child to absolutely believe in the Tooth Fairy, no questions asked, please keep in mind that the book can be ""thought provoking."""
5,One of my favorite childhood books...,"The is one if the books I loved as a child, and someday if I have a child, I will be reading this to her/him! I remember getting lost in the illustrations...and reading it again now, it has a lot of humor."
5,cute book,The tooth fairy left this book for my little one when she lost her first tooth. I had this book when I was a child and I loved it as much as she does. We have to read it every time we have a tooth fall out in our house!!
5,Great for younger ones,"My 4 y/o had to get his two front teeth pulled, and I was not at all prepared to face this milestone 1-2 years ahead of schedule. Especially with no one else around him who's lost their teeth, the whole idea was new to him. I was so thankful to have heard about this book. It was a sweet and lovely way to explain the basics, to calm some concerns/fears a toddler may have, and also to introduce the whole idea of ""tooth fairies."" I loved that there was a bit of mystery about the existence of tooth fairy. Compared to another book I had bought, ""Truman's Loose Tooth,"" this was by far the better book, esp for younger children."
3,It gets the job done,"This holster is okay. It does the job great. But, the clip part is a little too long. It pokes into my leg. Also, why couldn't they make the color of this thing black, or a dark blue, like the phone instead of this light brown color? But, like I said, it gets the job done."
3,Not too bad,"I would consider this glue a medium strength ""super glue"" but no less. For small repairs and projects it is sufficient. It does not leave white residue that most super glues leave so I would consider it a very clean adhesive. I still prefer my Loctite gel but I certainly am not prejudice against the BSI cyanoacrylate adhesive. It is a great value in regards to price per quantity."
3,Not bad for a little kitchen TV,"The TV works well, but since it isn't high definition and doesn't have a digital tuner, it won't be good for that long. I use it as a little TV that moves around, sometimes in the kitchen, sometimes in my office, etc.Not a bad deal, but you need to know going in that it won't be very useful after 2009."
2,Not the best one to buy,"I really didn't like this workout routine. The core workout hardly makes me break a sweat and I'm totally out of shape. The metabolic booster workout is way too complex and I feel like I miss half of the benefits from the workout because I'm too busy trying to do the moves right. Overall, this is my least favorite video from Jennifer Kries."
4,Great!,I have been exercising with this DVD for 2 years now and i love it.The Yoga routine at the end is a real treat.
1,forget this book,"I bought 3 books on the subject all were better then this. this is about ""alternative"" medicine. forget it. i through it out."
4,"Nobody's perfect, even Stephen.","I thought this book was/is great. It says alot about people, and how sometimes we judge them incorrectly. I also thought it was realistic becuase once in a while we may be intimedated by others. I didnt really think there was a bad point in this book. I thought it was very good, and also written well. It tells alot about everyone including yourself. Even though you may not think that your good enough doesnt mean it's true. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to read about realistic events. I could realate to Sunny(main charactor) on alot of promblems that took place in the book, and I agree with the leassons learned. The author wrote this book well. It's not a hard book. It's easy for kids to read. The author is also very discriptive about her charactors. It's easy to follow the story as you read. I think she did a really good job. I hope you to will take the time to read this book and I hope you will enjoy it."
3,Not really in MY element,"I see outside of Mr. Non-Review, who hadn't actually heard the record, everyone here gives this disc at least four stars. Well, let me be the first to rain just a bit on this parade. Glasper didn't live up to his hip-hoppish, new-thing hype for me at all. Surprisingly mainstream and old-school, and never really catching fire, while listening to him I find myself thinking of Bill Evans, which I'd suggest is not good for a 21st century, under-30 pianist. Based on this and Canvas, I'd say Glasper, like so many jazz musicians, may have a studio problem. Compare the four-cut Live at Bonnaroo EP on iTunes, which despite less than stellar recording conditions, really cooks."
5,An Enlightened Voice in Jazz,"Every so often I am blessed by the introduction to a young artist, whose artistry, wisdom, and confidence far exceed what their chronological age would seem to allow for. Robert Glasper is a brilliant and inspired young artist, with the personal history, education, and humility to create music that is fresh to his own voice, timeless and classic. May he live a long life for he has so much with which to uplift our hearts. He carries forth a legacy of American Jazz that embodies intelligence, joy, passion, and innovation. Not an easy accomplishment."
1,typical U.S. government propaganda,"This goofy book purports to be a scientific analysis of smoking ""bad things."" Most of the chapters, predictably, are about marijuana. Cocaine, PCP, heroin, and tobacco are also briefly covered. Read this book to get a good idea about the ""party line"" on pot in 1990, but not for the ""straight dope."" For more factual materials, try, ""The Great Book of Hemp,"" by Robinson, and, ""Hemp & the Marijuana Consipracy, The Emperor Wears No Clothes,"" by Herer."
5,AVAILABLE IN PANCLASSICS,"This very beatiful CD is available now in Panclassics.Well, if you wish to know from where Ariel Ramirez drew his inspiration, you'll find it in this CD.This is a most joyous selection of music from the time of the Conquistadores at the 17th century in South America.Most of the music is religious, but this CD shows that religious practice can be light and delightful.A superb performance and an excellent recording."
5,Love this thing!,"Love this thing, use it every day whether in the ocean or the pool, free diving or swimming. If your one of these people where goggles don't quite work this is also for you, loads of people stop me and ask me where to get one - buy one and enjoy!"
1,bookhog,This is one of the weakest story lines I've come across in ages and the character development is almost nonexistant. Not a very good book.
3,A little too spicy and needs a little more help.,"I purchased one bag of this at a specialty store. I made it but added a can of tomato sauce with the hamburger, seasoning and macaroni. This last time I decided to make it as the bag stated and my family wouldn't eat it. The tomato sauce helped to mellow it out a bit. Since I have 5 more bags I will be doctoring it to find the best method of cooking it. I love Namaste baked goods but this item isn't that great."
4,Entertaining and Educational,"A most entertaining grammar, in which Cobbett applies his poison political pen to, of all things, a precise study of the English language. Cobbett's instruction on our language is indeed impressive and contains information useful even today. However, the real fun starts with his made-up examples of bad grammar, which frequently include a completely gratuitious broadside aimed at one political antagonist or another. He also quotes extensively from these political antagonists to demonstrate how their book learning and social position in no way prevent them from committing astounding blunders of grammer and cogitation."
5,An exciting twist on love...,"This book is about a mid-thirty year old wife who is left with her 2 kids by her husband who runs off with the cliche 20-something year old bombshell. The author takes you through her road from devastation to finding happiness once again where it was least expected! Exciting read, couldn't put it down! Another Jane Moore hit!"
3,"A light read, but full of cliches","These books about women finding love are some of my favorites because they are easy entertainment, but I grew bored with it by the end. There wasn't much depth to the characters such as with Rosie, Jo's best friend. She was the stereotypical plain, chubby sidekick with low self-esteem. The men that are vying for Jo's affection weren't that great either. Martin seemed dry and humorless and I was left wondering why Jo would even consider him. Sean seemed to have the most personality out of all four men except for his ""flaw."" Jeff was infuriating and Conor seemed too perfect to be true. I think there could have been more development between Jo and the men, especially Conor. The characters and their dialogue seemed too perfect too; everyone was so...""nice."" I didn't expect too much from this book, but I've read better ""chick-lit"" and this one was disappointing."
5,Almost too addictive,"I started this book out of curiosity. It belonged to my mother and has been sitting on the bookshelf for over a year. With little else to do but study, I started Fourplay to relieve the boredom.By the third page I was hooked. With her rollercoaster of emotions and events, Jo Miles provided me with the ultimate distraction from revision.I strongly reccommend this book to anyone who has ever been remotely interested in what makes relationships work. But make sure you have enough free time when you start it, or the other things will get ignored."
3,A good read,"A good read. I really enjoyed all the quick lines and great dialogue between all the characters.Jo Miles the heroine of this book is trying to find out who she is after a divorce but I really felt like shaking Jo Miles at times and found myself mumbling to the book for her to do something anything other that what she did or didn't do. Although, the book is a good read and I recommend it I felt as if Jo was a bit naive slow to wise up.All in all a good book to take to the beach."
5,Best on the Market,Get this glue and some disposable glue tips! If you build model kits this is really all you need. Great stuff!
5,Great Stuff,"I tried in the past to get copies of this set for gifts for my pals in the USA..It was unavailable.. So glad to see it on offer now.. I've watched these episodes many times over the years.. God , how I have laughed.. In the UK Father Ted is considered to be one of the funniest shows ever.. and it really is.. You will NOT regret it.. High church mocking humour!"
1,Canned Laughter,"This show seems like it would be a good idea - good caste - good plot. It does not deliver. It is very poor film quality, including the sound. Every ""could be funny"" line is drenched with canned laughter. An audience should not have to be advised on when to laugh. I only made it through a few of the shows...almost painful."
5,Father Ted,I had really enjoyed the movie. It had made my husbands day and I really enjoyed the movies
1,they sold me dvds only playable in the UK,This is a region restricted box set and should not be sold in the US. I highly disagree with the regional nonsense BTW. I happen to like a lot of stuff from the UK and I cant watch them on my computer. LAME.
4,Father Ted series Enjoyable Distraction,"Enjoyed the series. I had never heard of it until an Australian talked about it and said how much his family enjoyed it. Typical British humor of the Faulty Towers genre. Very light humor and I did not find it anti-catholic. I converted to Catholicism about ten years ago and am conservative. Humorous setting (Craggy Island) and characters (Father Ted, Jack, Dougal and Mrs. Doyle). Enjoyed learning a few of the Irish terms like ""eejit"". I am still unsure whether this is an original Irish term or one adopted from the Father Ted series."
2,Not Worth the Hefty Price,"Unforgivably awful picture and sound quality. The home-made quality of the recording is inexcusable, and at this price, criminal. I have to agree with other reviewers that the canned laughter and warped-sounding theme music are really hard to tolerate. I used to like this program. What on earth was I thinking? It is very silly and funny, but not funny enough to justify the exorbitant price and lousy quality."
1,Sucks :(,This phone is totally adorable!! but it came broken and they wouldn't return it or reply to any of my emails! Sucks!
1,Not pleased..,I've yet to find anything it works on. Tried bonding a shoe sole to shoe with no luck. Tryed two different kinds of plastic with no luck. I realize different glues do differente things. I had just expected more.
3,Accept carries on without Udo,"Despite the departure of Udo Dirkschneider and his successor, the unknown David Reece, Accept turned in a solid performance on Eat The Heat. Although this album is definitely more commercial than any of its predecessors, tracks such as ""Hellhammer,"" ""X-T-C,"" and ""Prisoner"" still have that signature Hoffmann guitarwork and Accept ""bite."" Yes, Accept was more than merely Udo - steadfasts Peter, Wolf, and Steffan were all present for this recording. If you call yourself an Accept fan and don't own this album yet, I suggest acquiring it while you still can. Reece's vocals are obviously different from Dirkschneider's, but while listening to it I don't confuse it with another band other than Accept. And for all you die-hard Udo fans, you can hear his vocals in the background of ""Turn The Wheel Around."""
2,The day Accept sold out....,"The year is 1989. Udo Dirkschneider is gone, so Accpet feel free to ""accept"" the dubious good advises from their managers / record company executives / whoever, and they go for an all-out assault to ""make America"", destroying their established raw sound for a pedestrian, lifeless, stupid hair-metal sound typical of middle-eighties... What a shame.. Udo's replacement, David Reece, no doubt has a powerful set of lungs, but he delivers the songs in an unoriginal way, similar to all of the hair metal bands of the eighties.EAT THE HEAT is a very bad album, don't be fooled by the others reviews. Of course, Wolf Hoffmann and the rest of the guys are extremely talented heavy rockers, but the trouble here is the lack of soul in the record: it is clearly a commercial metal product from that period, with all the obligatory love ballads, love lyrics, reverbered drums, etc. When you compare it with their previous classics, even with RUSSIAN ROULETTE, you will want to cry. Skip it."
2,only one good song,"I traded this CDs years ago but I don know that there is at least 1 good song on it and that is ""Generation Clash"" At least this guy was a better singer than the little midget!"
5,"If You Are Looking For One Album Of Trail Songs, This Is It","Although I am not normally a proponent of Greatest Hits albums, if you are looking for an essential album of trail songs, buy this album. Essentially, ""On The Trail Again"" coalesces all of Mr. Lane's classic Western songs: ""Strange Lady In Town"" ""Dueces Wild"", ""Dead Man's Hand"", ""High Noon"", they are all here. If you are planning a road trip through the American West, these tunes are indispensable and combine great music with Hollywood's image of ""The West of the Imagination"". Again, highly recommended and (in my opinion) the best of Mr. Lane's compilation albums."
1,Do not buy,"Terrible, as far as manualsI own a 1979 trans am, well over 100,000 of these were produced that year alone. this manual has a few, maybe 3 or 4 things that I could use to work on my car. There was no engine harness diagram drawing. Most, if not all of the pictures are for a second gen Camaro.My advise is to save your money, pick one up at a yard sale, but don't pay more than 2 bucks for it."
1,Wrong Movie,"This movie was labled ""The Mother Goose Treasury Volumes III & IV"" on both the tape and case but it actually played Volumes I & II. Didn't get what I ordered at ALL!!! Don't buy it... who knows what you'll get."
1,Little Miss Muffet & 8 Other Stories,"This is the same VHS as The Mother Goose Vol. III & IV. I didn't realize & was upset that it was represented as a different VHS. Took to the Consignment story in town for the hospital. Was very disappointed with the representation. I know I fault for not looking closer, but dealer would do nothing about it."
1,Repeats,"I have the Mother Goose Treasury Volumes 1 & 2, and when I went to play 3 & 4, I read the back of the video and all of the songs/rhymes are the same.I am a little disappointed."
3,Overall Excellent and Accessible - Misprints are a problem,"Approachable, stunningly beautiful and accessible (eso. for the price!) ... However - there are some publication problems with omissions/repeat of pages in Isaiah and Luke -- prob. wouldn't notice if you don't read German -- but bothersome (reason for 3 stars vs. 5 stars). Still, excellent quality (paper and color images), cover, and accompanying commentary. Esp. for the price (vs. more expensive Wycliffe facsimile) -- can't beat for ammature German history buffs."
3,poor quality printing,"I bought this Bible from a german site and was quite disappointed after delivery. The quality of the pictures which look quite good on the internet is very poor on the real thing. The colours are far too dark and that spoils the details of the old engravings. The two books have been printed on low-quality paper which is a shame considering the price and the beauty of this Bible. This Biblia, originally sold at 99.99 euros is now sold for 39.99 euros on some german sites. I suppose that the edition sold in the US must be of far better quality, considering the huge difference in price.This Bible was not only a masterpiece of print-making but was very instrumental into the fixing of the german language. Modern readers are surprised at how readable is the text and how close it is to modern german."
4,Very worth buying!,"This fit perfectly in my Mitsubishi Mirage 1998, and i have had it one for about a week with no problems at all! It is a great price as well! the only reason i gave it a 4 star is because the sticky stuff that is supposed to stick to the holder wasn't very good. i would recommend buying some better glue and using that!Overall i would buy this again!"
4,Nice table-top fountain however...,"I love the looks of this fountain! It fits into my livingroom decor better than some of the other table-top fountains out there. I also love the candle effect. It gives off a warm, inviting glow that is soft and soothing. The pump on the fountain is quiet and of course, that is a big plus.Now that being said, I am NOT fond of the 4 Relaxing sound effects feature. The sound is very tinney(?) and not relaxing at all. It sounds more like a child's toy than an instrument of relaxation therapy. I would rather listen to my own music with the fountain accompanying."
5,Music at its finest.,"This cd is a one of a kind from this ""late"" great artist. It features the hits ""We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off"" and ""Jody"". Highly recommended."
4,Elastinet dressing,"iten works fine, but it is very hard to initially get the proper sizing, it should be made clearer to a customer how sizing of the item works."
3,this is a good dvd,THE PICTURE IS GOOD AND SO IS THE SOUND AND TWO OF THE EPISODES HAVE ORIGINAL COMMMERCIALS. BAD THING:NO ORIGINAL THEME MUSIC EXEPT ONE EPISODE AT THE END OF THE SHOW
1,diddy you suck,smart move getting the lead pussycat freak to sing otherr than that i wish i could give this no stars at all.
2,Bleck!,"I became devoted to Tedford after reading the first book in the series (Rashanyn Dark) and spent (literally!) years searching for this disappointing sequel in the series. Very fluffy and it just smacks of ""I've got to make another book cuz my publisher told me to"" syndrome."
5,EXCELLENT!,"I, by chance, heard this CD playing in a friend's car and immediately knew I had to have it for my collection. A wonderful mix of r&b, rock hits, and classics that sound fresh as the day they first hit the airwaves. I'd recommend this CD for anyone who loved these songs the first time around. A true gem."
3,An interesting resource,"This is an ideal book for the beginning herbalist. It is a simple practical introduction to herbal medicine. Six areas of health are covered with suggested herbal remedies. These areas are: digestive problems, respiratory problems, female problems, problems with muscles, joints, and back, nervous problems, and skin problems. Along with the herbal remedy for each affliction the book gives information about the herb suggested and and the practical history of the herbs themselves. Instruction for preparation and gathering of each herb is given.For a person interested in colonial history the book has many anecdotes and quotes from historical medical books that are quite amusing. With the many historical anecdotes and quotes included in the book it is easily read, almost as easy as fiction."
3,Disappointing sequel to his wartime classic,"Newby writes amusingly about his post war experiences but they are nowhere near as interesting or moving as ""Love and war in the Appenines"", his book about imprisonment and love in World War Two Italy. Now married to his Slovenian sweetheart Wanda, who helped him evade capture, Newby finds himself working for the struggling London fashion firm run by his father. He is no good at the job and has no fun trying to sell frmupy clothes to staid and frumpy clothes stores around Britain. Newby expertly delves into the characters of his father, who is only happy when in a rowing scull, and the other eccentrics at the firm. The problem is that unless you have an abiding interest in and knowledge of the clothes trade, you'll quickly bog down in yet another torpid tale of which Scottish dowager looked disapprovingly at a certain unimpressive dress. The book quickly bogs down and, very disappointingly, doesn't focus anywhere near enough on the formidable Wanda."
5,Lucky the Wonder Pup,My daughters love this wonder pup. He does exactly what the write up said he would do. It is a cute toy and they are enjoying it.
5,LUCKY IS INCREDIBLE!,"I got this toy for my 8-year-old granddaughter this Christmas. She loves animals, but I thought it might be too young for her. Boy, was I wrong! She absolutely loves this dog. It actually performs the tricks it is supposed to perform! She was so happy, and really thought of this dog as her real pet. She played with hime all morning making sure everyone in the family saw her dog perform! Do NOT hesitate to buy this dog. It's really cute, and for once, a battery-operated toy actually WORKS!!!!"
5,Should be Called Lucky the Phonics Dog,"We have had a wonderful time with this toy and no issues. We love Lucky because our daughter has a hard time with harsh sounds and the word Lucky (the ck together) is tough for her. The command ""speak"" also has this hard ""K"" sound. ""Tug of War"" has the ""G"" sound in it. ""Shake Hands"" has the letter ""K"" in it. This has really helped her say the word properly and when she does, the dog obeys. In addition other children with other letter combinations might find it helpful too. Commands such as ""sit"" and ""speak"", ""stand on your head"", ""shake hands"" might help kids with the ""s"" sounds etc. I've recommended this toy to the speech teacher at the school as well."
1,"Adorable, Wish it worked","This is the cutest little dog. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Would occasionally do a few things randomly, but not to any voice commands. Returned the item and seller was super easy to work with."
3,Not what I expected,"This dog is cute. I returned the first one and it did not get better with the second one. First while you can rename it, both dogs did not respond to their new name for more than three commands. So I went back to Lucky. Sometimes I have to call his name two or three times before he responds. He mostly always confuses the commands i.e. I say sit and he plays tug of war. My kids are young so I just say ""no you silly dog"" and they just laugh off the fact he didn't do the right trick. I only paid $30 dollars for Lucky so overall I'm not too upset. I wouldn't pay more than $30."
2,Bad Dog,"It was a big let down on Christmas morning when we opened up Lucky, put in batteries and tried to get him to do some tricks. We took turns speaking softly, loudly and even yelling at him (which really confused our dogs) but he would not respond at least 75% of the time."
3,what a cast.,"Good acting lifts a story you probably never heard of, out of the ordinary. Effective use of old newscasts adds a touch that forces the watcher to pay attention. Well done, despite the seen-it-before, plot structure."
5,A True Story - and Interesting,"In the 1970's Danny Green seemed to have wrapped the local (and New York) Mob around his finger. Incredibly courageous, and equally lucky when he pissed them off, this true story is a fascinating look at a guy who navigated the tough and dangerous underworld in Cleveland.With a stellar cast and equally great acting by players I've never seen before, I'd have to give this flick a ""must see"" rating."
3,Needs more punching,"See that giant explosion on the front cover? That's the most action you'll see in this movie. It's quite good, apart from the false advertising, with decent dialogue and serviceable acting, but I was a little let down that it wasn't what it looked like from the cover."
3,Kill The Irish Man,"Kill The Irish Man is a good however slow-paced movie based on a interesting yet Violent World of Cleveland's seedy underbelly and of course It's Unions(Corruption as usual and of course in this Case The ILA union name was Changed in the movie.)It is even better Than ""Departed"",and while I do not Condone Daniel Greene or similar person's actions it certainly makes you root for him on some matters,but one should not give into the Robin Hood or little guy vs.Big Guys myth,Crime is crime and just because one is Philanthropic does not excuse Evil.The movie is worth watching because is not your Usual ""Mob"" or Crime Drama epic,and seeing it has taken liberty with The Story of the Cleveland Mob and you Have some very familiar Actors,Great actors and Christopher Walken as usual does not disappoint."
5,Kill the Irshman,This movie is worth watching.A lot of great Actress and actors. It has a lot of action and suspense. Its well worth watching.
3,"Decent movie over all, but Goodfellas it ain't","The cover claims: ""The best gangster film since Goodfellas"", but the quote is from some local TV station, and is quite a stretch. But this is a fairly enjoyable mob/unions/cops movie. It plays very straight-ahead, and some of the roles are played very well. Especially Christopher Walken. After his Oscar-nominated ""Deer Hunter"" Stevie, he became rather a caricature, but he is a very good actor and here you see yet another side of him, playing a rather old man.The movie is ""based on a true story"", which helps the natural feel of the event flow. And the supporting cast is terrific, with several really good mob/gangster/procedural stalwarts appearing.I've been trying to think how to exactly sum up my take on this film, and here it is: If you were stuck in some motel somewhere, flipping channels with little hope of actual entertainment, and found this movie just starting, you'd be delighted with your find and would settle in quite happily."
5,"Fascinating Story, Wonderful Acting","Who doesn't love a good mafia story? Especially one set in Ohio! I really enjoyed this movie - the acting and plot were completely engrossing. I am not usually one for immediately watching special features after seeing a movie for the first time, but since this is based on a true story, I couldn't pass up watching the documentary that accompanied the film on DVD. It was just all so interesting! I have already lent this DVD out (within my home, of course) to friends and family, knowing that they will enjoy it, even if I don't have time to watch it again! Though, it is definitely a movie that I am sure I will watch more than once! It was really great!"
3,Documentary better than movie,"I grew up near Cleveland and was more interested in the history than the movie. I lived a few miles from Brainard Place and my dentist is in the same building where Danny Green was murdered. Despite some great old actors the performances were lousy, and the movies wasn't very acurate. I was more interested in the documentary special feature than the movie."
1,Return policy SUCKS!!!!!,It does NOT work in my DVD or in my laptop. It is not set for this region. I will NOT buy another thing from Anazon. The company wants me to pay postage to return it. Not MY fault!!!!!!!
1,movie- kill the irishman,this movie was great but the dvd was very poor quality and was not able to see the end of this movie. i will not purchase any other movies this way.
1,terrible lead actor ruined it for me,"Saw the trailer and got intrigued. The cast of thousands (Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Linda Cardellini of ""ER"" fame, Vinnie Jones from all those Guy Ritchie gangster flicks, Tony Lo Bianco [say what!?], Steve Schirripa from ""The Sopranos,"" Paul Sorvino...and on and on) is impressive in all the bit roles but the lead actor (Ray Stevenson) is sheer awful. He has almost zero screen presence. The story itself is a pretty typical Mob flick and it seems more like a made-for-TV movie the way they shot its 1970s settings."
4,Sleeper Hit,"I didn't hear of this movie when it first came out, but it is really good. The acting is great and the story is engaging. Christopher Walken is great (I guess that generally goes without saying). This movie is definitely worth trying."
4,The Fighting Irish,"I ordered this movie (having not even HEARD of it!) and was pleasantly surprised! Based on a true story of an Irish immigrant, Danny Green, who rose from dock laborer to local ""gangster legend"" in 1970's is a character study of one man's ""American Dream"". Filmed in subdued colors, rich ethnic locations, period music (blaring soul tunes blended with soft Celtic folk music)I was reminded of the stark and gritty Martin Scorcesse films that have shown the many sides of Mobsters and their minions; I found Ray Stevenson's portrayal of Danny Green riveting, compelling, almost romantic in his fearless yet fatal belief that he was a Celtic Warrior reincarnated.....alas, we are but mortals.........."
4,The luck .....,"Of the Irish. This is the story of Danny Greene, an Irish mobster in Cleveland in the 1970's. Greene is played by Ray Stevenson. There is a strong supporting cast including Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Paul Sorvino and Ray D'Onofrio. The acting is solid and the story moves in an indie film style with a tip of the hat to Scorcese. Good solid entertainment."
2,Don't Believe the Two Critics' Reviews,"This movie was lame. Nothing you haven't seen 100 times before in other gangster movies, only this movie just repeats those cliches. The violence is formulaic - yes, there are lots of explosions. Realistic, I suppose, but the beatings were not. Almost comic book-like. A waste of time."
2,Pretty Bad,"Just watched this last night. My girlfriend feel asleep half way though, not surprisingly. This morning I told her ""don't worry about it. You didn't miss anything"". Yeah, this movie failed on most accounts except the actors. Christopher Walken has little more than a cameo and his lines and direction were so terrible that it didn't even feel like I was watching Christopher Walken! Val Kilmer can do so much better too. He's in the movie a fair amount but is so hamstrung by the film itself that it's like he's not even there.This is a sad, non-riveting docudrama that has little actual story to it, and what shallow fragments of plot we do get are so cliche! Kill the Irishman gets 2 stars because the actors did their best, the film looks professionally shot, there are a few moments that were decent, and I got to see some tits by the end.All in all, Disappointing.Awake!Venger As'Nas SatanisIpsissimusCult of Cthulhu"
3,Different than other videos... Not exactly what I expected,"This video is not like traditional abs videos. Most videos (8-minute abs, Gilad abs workout, etc) contain a set workout with an instructor leading you through routines. This video is more like an instruction manual on what exercises to do and how to do them. It is not something you are going to watch for each workout. It is something that you will reference on occasion prior to doing your own workouts. It does have good tips in regards to form, sets, nutrition, etc (not much more than what you find in a Muscle and Fitness or Men's Health magazine though). Not a lot of advanced moves or things that I have not seen before. The video quality is not the best but it does have a lot of content.Overall, it takes a different approach than other fitness videos and is almost like an interactive abs book."
1,Not A Workout DVD,I'm very disappointed in this DVD. I wanted a daily routine of ab workouts. What i got was a video that is 80% talking without any exercises. Then when they do show the exercises they are clumped all together at the end without any instructions. Definitely not worth the $18 if you want a great ab DVD to follow.
3,Great buy!,"But this product expecting that OEM stood for Original Equipment Manufacturer, but it stands for Original Engine Maintenance which is the brand, this is a little misleading. Overall the product works fine and I haven't had any problems. Will keep posted."
4,so far so good,"It has worked for a few hundred miles so far. It didn't fit as well as the original, but it did seal and seems to function. Miss on cyl # 5 is no longer a problem."
1,junk,Says made in Germany but really is made in China. I put as much pressure as humanly possible on the lever handle and it would not cut my fingernails let alone a toenail.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I didn't get what the picture shows!!! I got a 56 pieces set instead of a 60... i am really disappointed!!! i am missing the blender and the mixer which convinced me of buying this set instead of others!!!
3,Edges seem to crumble,The edges of the belt are wearing off. The buckle needle really bites into the leather and the belt is rapidly losing shape. Not too bad for an inexpensive leather reversible though. There are definitely better products out there.
2,Starts tearing off,"The first impression and 2 months of this belt was great! After this, it literally started to tear off. It's not like I wore it everyday but it seemed to me that it should be worn once a month so it lasts at least a year!"
2,"Cool belt, leather cracked within weeks.","Cool belt. Nice and wide/thick. Dual colors prevent the wife taunting for matching shoes. Extra cool plain pilgrim buckle. Very manly, just like me.Unlike me, it fell apart quickly. Within a few weeks, the leather along the buckling part (where the holes are that you actually buckle) started fraying/cracking. Now it's almost in two pieces there. I tried leather conditioner etc. but no luck. It will live at the landfill soon, but I'll probably keep the buckle because its so darned manly and cool. If only I could find some high quality leather to put into it."
3,"Fine as a belt, but beware....","Tragically, this belt consistently sets off the metal detectors at airports. Shame, because otherwise it's just dandy."
1,the belt is really bad,the belt is really bad it ruin my other pents it stain them with the brown color of the other side
3,Nice Little Album,"I always like to give an album a few spins before deciding whether to keep it or trade it back in. This is an album worth holding onto for the occasional listen when you are looking for something a little different. It sort of hits me like the Flaming Lips; Quirky, fun to listen to but not something I am in the mood for all the time."
4,Vatos,"Head of Femur is a band from Chicago, which has in its catalog-pop songs, but very special in some way close to XTC, but with more oomph. The trio was accompanied during the tours of other elements such as horns, synths, strings. And the compositions are pretty rich, enough in one piece from this album made me fall in love with them, ah there were the new bands like these."
1,white elephant,"Ouch, I know.. 1 star???... unfortunately yes. I bought it and would trade it for just about anything else. sigh.. I've just never been so disappointed with an album ever since I switched over to this whole marvelous ""indie rock"" thing. As stated before, there was no spark to want to listen again, I gave it enough plays but there wasn't a single moment to bring me back and possibly discover more. To each his own and no thanks."
2,Austin UnPowers,"Did the Brits ever really get psychedlic music? If this CD is any indication the answer has to be no. Pink Floyd got it, but I think they're maybe the only Brit band that did. If you want psychedlic, go to San Francisco.This CD is a curiosity. It's not really psychedelic. It's more like bubble gum. But it's not very good at that either. This CD is for those who have large 60s collection that they've become bored with and are looking for marginalia. A spin or two with it may get you off the 60s all together. Once you get to this point there really isn't anything more available."
5,Great!!,"Great book, i learned alot by reading it. Shows how men and womens behave and how should the opposite gender should act apon it"
1,Terrible Practice tests.,"I bought this book mainly for the practice tests, but I couldn't even get past the grammar section. The book contains too many questions that are unlikely to appear on the ACT, many of which are poorly worded. If you are looking for a book with good tips and useful information, then get the Princeton Review - it also has pretty good practice tests. If you are just looking for practice tests, then get the Real ACT book; they provide detailed explinations of each answer, and have real ACT tests."
2,Wait for next edition,I think a new edition is coming out very soon -- definitely needed as this is much skimpier than other ACT prep books
5,Cute,"We purchased this for family friends for their new little girl. They liked it and thought it was cute. I don't know much on reviewing baby clothes, but this one was a winner:)"
4,Serenely beautiful. Music to meditate by.,"Less expansive and involving than Kater's ""Migration"" (with Carlos Nakai), but this is some of the most serenely contemplative music I have heard. Perfect to play in a darkened room at the end of a numbing day. Seventy-five unbroken minutes of uncomplicated soul-massaging harmony. The blending of real voice, flute, violin, and cello infuse Kater's synthesized sounds with the realm of the natural."
2,Barking up the wrong tree,"I hate to be negative, but this effort is not nearly as satisfying as ""Alphabet Soup"". They have used all of the same ingredients, but it just does not work.The movie begins with advertisements for other home videos, which our children do not need to be subjected. (Personal note: Please let us have a moment of peace and allow us to watch a movie without ads!)While ""Alphabet Soup"" is very entertaining for adults and children, this movie is rather slow. The redundant, ad-lib dialogue makes you feel like there was not enough legitimate content in the script. In addition, each rhyme should be read in its entirety while the dogs are performing, rather than the constant interruptions with the narrator's boring commentary. Nursery rhymes are meant to flow like music, but you can't feel the rhythm when commentary is added throughout each nursery rhyme."
5,Northern Sagas,"The Greenlanders is an amazing book, rich in detail and characterization and history, and written as though an old tale is being told by one who observed it all. I recommend the books by the earlier Norwegian writer, Sigrid Undset, to anyone who wants more historical novels of similar flavor."
5,An oddity worth reading,"Who writes novels about Greenlanders in the 13th century? Nobody, except Jane Smiley--and she pulls it off. The names and lineage get a bit difficult to follow at times, but I wascompletely absorbed in this book from beginning to end."
2,As wooden as the proud ships they sailed in,"This is a research-driven book. The author obviously did a lot of reading and then stacked up her note cards, hoping the accretion of historical details would ipso facto form a novel.It didn't. The book is tedious. The characters are cardboard. The dialgoue sounds like one of those Hollywood Golden Age historical dramas where the 16th-century Englishmen all think they should sound like Shakespeare.And like one of those dispiriting Greenland winters, it goes on and on and on.Occasionally she captures a mood, but by and large this is the Elvis Impersonator of sagas. Hard to believe it's by an author as good as Jane Smiley."
5,A true work of literature,"Jane smiley is a writer on consummate ability. She creates characters who are realistic and totally believable.Her creations in "" the greenlanders"". Will remain with you long after youh are done reading."
3,"Good, not great",I'm a huge fan of hers. There were a few things that I didn't like about this one:1) Too long and repetitive. 1/4 could have been pruned2) Weak character development3) Confusing at parts
2,Didn't make it.....,"I am an avid reader and have read most all of Jane Smiley's books. I picked this book up at a library book sale for 50 cents...and that's a good thing, because it sure wasn't worth much more to me. I could NOT get past the similar and way too frequent names of the characters. The writing style is almost biblical...in it's lack of readability. I can surely understand someone with a Nordic background liking this book, and spending the time getting past it's pittfalls. Also....three cheers to the folks that used it as background for their trip to Greenland. As for the casual, or even serious reader......find something else and don't waste your money."
2,"Huge, detailed, plodding... Couldn't get through it","I want to start out by saying I am fascinated by everything Viking and Nordic, so it is not as if the setting did not intrigue me. It did. The problem with the novel (or the first 130 pages I could get through) is that it is so encyclopedic that the setting didn't do much of anything for me. Who the wants to read about churning butter, building fences, or studying at a monestary? There was one part about a witch that was fascinating, and the relationship between the skraelings and norseman was interesting, but other than that what is there but 90 pages of quotidian boredom? Reading this book makes me feel like a cold, starving norseman in need of some rape and pillage. But with a politically-correct feminist like Jane Smiley leading the way, you'll be kept wanting."
2,shutter lag,"I bought this case from Amazon for my Dimage X (the old one, with 2MP). It fitted nicely onto the camera, but the nasty surprise came when I actually tried to use it during snorkeling.The shutter lag is about a second, which means that the camera takes a picture about a second after you press the button (see other review). Now try shooting fish when bouncing in the surf!Very disappointing indeed. I hope they fixed this for the Xt, because the Minolta hotline plainly stated, that it's just the way it is for my camera, not fix is being considered. Now if you shoot static pictures on the beach, the case may be nice, but trying to frame marine life is next to impossible and makes the case practically useless for snorkelers or divers."
3,Not a lot of response,"I added this to my 95 wrangler, and it seemed to improve just a little. I also have the airaid cold air intake and bored out intake manifold, so I dont know whether that was the culprit for most of the power gain."
3,Not what I hoped for but ok,"This studio is very portable and that is nice for traveling. The main problem I have is the ""seemless"" backround they give you has a huge crease in it and it makes it not a seemless background. I cannot get the fold out of it so I have to use something else for the background I guess. Just a little warning. Other than that it's a pretty convenient little portable set up."
4,Very good for small pictures,"This studio is great for product catalog pictures and ebay pictures. It allows good lighting to be displayed through the two lamps. The reason I gave it four stars is the difficulty of getting the legs of the lamps out. I had to take the lights away from the handles and then hit them at an angle to get them to extract. After the first time, you should not need to fully insert the legs back into the handle. This is just a recommendation for future purchasers of this product."
2,Photo Studio,"If it were not for the legs of the lights I would say it is a fairly nice product. Now, after much thought, I have come to the conclusion that someone must have paid a lot of money to an engineer to come up with an extremely poor design. The legs on one of my lamps failed to work the first time out. The second one the third time. I am in the process of undesigning the engineers design and make it work, but truthfully, it shouldn't be like that. This product was probably made in China."
5,Excellent choice,"I'm delighted with this product. Everything arrived in perfect condition, and the customer service at the 800 number in the instructions was responsive and appropriate. The lamp intensity is the best available for this size light box and I feel I could not have made a better choice. Price was lower than anything comparable which actually didn't have as good features. I'm a happy campter."
4,eh...,"Bought this as a gift for my husband to use to photograph his scrollsaw projects. He's pretty happy with it, however, it is really too small for most of the projects he makes."
5,Solid product,"This is not a hard core professional kit. But it's still a great value, and the company stands behind it. I have given two away as gifts, one to an amateur and one to a professional. Both love them. My pro friend tells me her kit has limitations, but is still very handy and a convenient addition to her tool box. The amateur is beside himself with it and uses it to capture images for his blog. There was also a problem my pro friend had with the lights. We contacted American Recorder about the issue and they sent us new ones, no charge, and were very helpful and a pleasure to work with. More companies need to behave like they do."
2,"Ok, but not great",This studio in a box is very well engineered. It folds up and tucks away in its self-contained carrier. But I found the camera stand too high (and it doesn't adjust lower) and the lights to be too dim. If find I get better lighting just by setting up next to a window.
4,Good Product,"I wish, it came with more choice of background color such as black, white,,.It works fine."
5,Mutant X dvd,"I received the dvd very promptly, well within the time frame promised. It arrived in the condition promised by the vendor. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again in the future."
3,"Not as good as the first two in the series, but still good.","Can't do more than fully agree to the review of Harriet here. Treloar becomes uninteresting since he is not personally involved, his character is not as eleborate as in the other two splendid novels. As with SPQR, the series started of very promising. But Roberts seems to be losing interest after 2 books...."
1,This Toy Sucks!!!,My son saw the comercial for this toy before christmas and that is all he talked about it. It is the only thing that he wanted Santa to get him for christmas. So we choose this as his big santa gift this year. This toy is not good!!! Do not purchase this toy for your child!!!
1,"Don't buy, wast of time and money",It looks like a portable lite brite. You can't even black out the screen to start a new picture. A friend told me her son didn't like it because he couldn't operate it. My 8 year old put it on the top of his list. I had hoped the only reason my friend's son couldn't operate the toy was because he is three. I couldn't even get it to remotely work.
1,SpectraColor is BLAND !!!,"My daughter received one of these for her birthday...she was sooo excited until she started playing with it....in her words ""Mom, this doesn't do anything that the one on TV does"".The manufacture should issue a recall....this is totally a dud of a product. Don't waste your money."
1,Worst Toy This Year,"This toy was a major disappointment! I think it will keep my daughter busy for about an hour just trying to figure this thing out. You can't see the colors very well unless you are in a dark room and I can't imagine any child playing in the dark with this toy. I'm sure if I keep it, it will just end up at the bottom of the toy box. I will definately take this one back, glad I kept the receipt."
1,A complete waste of money,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I would have been better off buying a magna doodle. Not only does it not work the way they said it would, the colors are NOT vibrant the paper schemes are worthless and it takes way too much battery power. I have never been so disappointed in a toy. The commercials made the kids want it and it did seem like fun but the actual toy itself is not what they predicted. I wouldnt recommend anybody wasting their moneyon it."
3,Blisters!!!,"I purchased this toy for my 5 year old son. The very first time, he used it for about 1/2 hour in the dark, on a long car ride. When we arrived at our destination, he had large blisters on 6 out of 10 fingers! I was so angry! The novelty of this toy ran out pretty quick. He still likes to play with it once in awhile but only for 5 minutes, at the most, at a time. Also, the little plastic things are already starting to fall out."
1,Worst toy ever,Since I am only 5 years old. I am facinated by unusal stuff. Like Lights for example. But this toy is [not good]. You have to move pegs. I thought it would be like a touch screen.
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!,"A child is supposed to be able to make pictures with this either with their finger or the pen included, it hurts to use your finger and the pen is no help. Pictures are impossible to create and it is very heavy. Very disapointing and a complete waste of money."
2,Also feel deceived,"On TV this toy looked great. ""Santa"" brought one for each of my two kids, ages 3 and 5. How disappointed we were. The pegs move too easily which makes it hard, not to mention frustrating, to keep it a certain color. They should have made it so the colors stay put. Also, there should be an automatic shut off so the batteries don't die down. It is hard to expect young children to remember to always shut off toys especially when so many other toys have auto off. Also the patterns that come with it don't stay in place unless you hold them. Yeah, that's easy for little ones to do. Anyways, we too didn't want all the pegs from a Lite Brite around the house (we also have a 1 year old). We thought that this would be a perfect solution. Wrong, wrong, wrong we were. Save your money or purchase a Lite Brite."
1,DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE-FALSE ADVERTISING!!,"This has got to be possibly the WORST CASE of manufacturer misrepresentation of a toys performance. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews until after I bought 2 of these. They are IMPOSSIBLE to operate as described under any conditions! I can't believe Irwin Toys has the audacity to put out commercials and advertising material that has obviously been so ""doctored up"" and not expect a major consumer backlash. The only value of this toy is a good lesson for your children in FALSE ADVERTISING!!! I predict MANY UNHAPPY children on Christmas morning!!! Don't waste your money, find that receipt and do what I'm doing...RETURN FOR A REFUND!!!!!!!"
1,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I just recently purchased this toy because I thought my 3 year old would love it!! Well she would have if it worked like the commercial said!! BUT, it doesn't. I tried it out first before christmas just to see what it was like and I was very disappointed. It is nothing at all like what you think it will be like. The colors are not vibrant and the pegs in this toy are ridiculous, they dont stay where you put them and you cant make a picture from the template. You cant tell what picture it is. Needless to say, I am returning it to the store."
1,Not Worth The Money They should give it away for free,"I agree with everyone on this page. I wish I would have read this before buying it for my 3 and 6 year olds for there birthday. We had there party's together and they really wanted it when they got it we as adults age 35,52,26, couldn't even do this. So I belive they did alot of computer work on the TV. Thank goodness I was able to take this back and get my money backI read a lady that said that the compnay said it was her daughters age at 4 that it wouldn't work right well then I guess they should change the age limit from 3 and up to never be able to work it and up."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this for my 6 year old for his birthday. The commercial looks great, but it really doesn't work like that. He played with it for about 3 minutes and when he couldn't get the colors to go in the right place - he put it down. Don't waste your money and 4 ""D"" batteries (which make it heavy)."
2,"Not as advertised, even on the box itself!","While my son actually does play with it and likes it, he is very patient because my wife and I felt it was very sub-par. Since the little 'slider' things don't really stay in place you end up spending most of your time meticulously trying to get individual lights to point in the right direction, it's truly maddening. I am truly disappointed with the product itself but I will say my four-year-old does like it and plays with it!"
1,Unsatisfied,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old. She never even touched it. My 5 year old that that the colors were nice and played with it for about 1 hour. Then it sat on the shelf in the playroom, never to be played with again. Do not waste your money."
1,Why Didn't I Check the Reviews First???!!!,"This toy is a total sham. I too bought it for my three year old thinking it was a cool and safe alternative to lite brite. My 3,5,and 7 year old all tried it and were so disappointed that they could not make a picture or even a line with the colors. I can't believe this toy made it to market. The designer should be fired. I will try to return it and get my money back. Don't buy this toy!"
1,worst toy i ever bought,There should be a recall on this toy. It does nothing. I tried to make it do what they say it should and I couldn't and I am an adult. My grandchild was very dissappointed. Toysrus should never carry such a dissappointing toy.
1,A Big Disappointment!,My five year old received this for Christmas. It has been a major disappointment. It is totally useless and does not work like they advertise.
1,THIS TOY DOES NOTHING AT ALL!!!!!!,"I just bought this toy for my daughter and I should have read the reviews!!! This toy does not do a thing, it was a total waste of money. It's just a bunch of pegs with lights that turn color when you touch them. Forget about the stencils and the stylus pen they included, you can throw them right out, because they are useless. I am returning this back to the store today. This was a total disappointment. I can believe this company actually put out a toy that does't do anything! My daugther kept asking me what I should do with it and I really did not know what to say!!!!!!!!!"
1,Please Don't Get This One!,"I saw this on TV and thought it would be a great toy for my nearly 4 year olds. It's a big disappointment. The colors don't show up like they do on TV. The little beads don't all go when you push them in the direction of the color you want. You can make yourself crazy trying. Please don't be fooled by the great advertisement for it. I did and I'm sorry that I spent the ... dollars. Save your money. Lite Brite, the tried and true, is still probably your best bet."
1,this toy is a joke!!!,"this toy has great pictures and examples on the box. , but, those images were almost surely created by artists and computers!!! this toy is a complete waste of money!!! how do companies test these toys??? they should have tested it on my 3yr old, then it would have never made it to the shelves of our stores. ( i wish there was a rating for zero stars because it doesnt deserve the lowest score of one star)."
1,"AT BEST, A DIM LIGHT SOURCE!","This toy should be called the world's most worthless toy. The toy eats batteries! There is absolutely NO WAY you can make a picture on this toy. At best, I would call it a a dim light source. I can sum it up in a few short sentences. Your child would have more fun with a toothache...at least they would get a good surprise from the dentist, at least the toothbrush works!"
1,Waste of Money!,"I was so excited when I found this for my son. Then we opened it and the interest lasted about 10 minutes. That's how long before we realized you can't make any definite patterns, its hard to move the pegs and they hurt your fingers. The only good thing about it is that its heavy and didn't break easy. I don't think it cracked at all when I threw it in the trash."
2,Good for other needs,"My daughter has enjoyed this product. It can be difficult to create the pictures as instructed, but she has been creative and found entertainment from it none the less. But while babysitting a child with Cerebral Palsy I found it to be fantastic. This little girl is very tactile and this toy is perfect for that. For a special needs child it provides visual, tactile, and even auditory stimulation. I'm buying a second one for her to learn and play with."
1,Spectra-Garbage,"Do NOT buy this toy. An adult cannot even achieve success with this hard to manipulate toy. You can use a plastic stylus to move the mini-lightbulbs to the color of choice, but it doesn't work well. Or, you can use your hand in an attempt to achieve the same aim. This method irritates the skin in no time (possibly for a child needing more sensory feedback, this feature might be of value). Even when one tries to draw a row of colors all the same, the slightest pressure in the wrong direction renders your efforts futile. The packaging dishonestyly beats the drum for the simplicity of this toy. After playing with it, most people are disappointed in what they can produce. If I could get my money back for this toy, I would."
1,[Unsatisfied],I just gave this toy as a gift and I am extremely disappointed with it. It does not do anything that the box says it does. It is very difficult to get the right color to appear and the pen that you use to make pictures is useless. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!
1,Worst Toy to Buy,I bought this toy for my son for Christmas and now I wish I did not waste my money on it. The description given on T.V. was completely opposite of what this toy does. It is very boring for my 3 yr old who has not touched it since the first time he used it.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,THIS TOY IS AWFUL. IT IS SHOWN TO HAVE SHARP BRIGHT PICTURES WHEN USING YOUR FINGER OR THE SPECIAL PEN. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO YOU CAN NOT SEE WHAT YOU HAVE DRAWN OR WHERE YOU HAVE DRAWN. YOU ALSO CAN NOT MAKE IT THE COLOR YOU WANT TO.
3,Not as stated,This toy does not work as advertised. You can not make no certain patterns like light brite. Your patterns just look like a big blob. Not worth the money.
1,Poor choice,"I am so glad we took this out of the box before giving it as a gift. All our kids (ages 1 - 11) were fascinated but NONE could make it work and they soon lost interest. We couldn't even get all the lights to ""erase"" at once. What a frustrating toy."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TOY!!,"I bought this toy at 50% discount from a local TOYS R US store. It turned out to be a very bad purchase. The light of each pixel is too bright to look at comfortably for a few minutes, the size of it is also too tiny to form any easily recognizable picture. And, it takes a long time to move each pixel to the desired direction. I let my soon-to-be-3-year-old daughter to play with it, she completely lost interests in a few minutes. Another feature of this product I don't like is that it uses 4 'D' size batteries. The idea of it could be OK, but the design is completely wrong."
4,Spectra Color,"My son received this for Christmas, and he as well got frustrated like someone else had stated.He didn't know how to use it, and when I showed him it's difficult to get a neat picture.My other kids play with it for the colors and lights.It is durable, but I really don't see the point of it."
3,Product review of Spectracolor,"This product, while excellent for a 3 to 5 year old, is unfortunately nothing like the commercial or pictures on the packaging. It is nearly impossible to create a clear image even using the templates provided. There is no way to have no-light or black. All of the colors run together preventing the child from creating any real image. This is definitely a try before you buy item requiring 4 D batteries for operation."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I can sum up my review of this product in four simple words: ""DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"". The 'ONLY' thing good I can say for this awful product is for the duriblity. After it has been thrown on the floor 'several' times in total frustration by my daughter (whom I purchased this for after she pleaded for it!) it still works. However she no longer even glances at it now, let alone plays with it! Do not be suckered in like my daughter and I were by the T.V. commercials, this product is NOT anywhere as easy and/or fun as the commercials make it appear. Again, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Very Disappointed - False Advertising,I was very disappointed in this itme. I purchased this item for my daughter and she did not play with it for very long. The item does not work as seen on tv or even on the box. It is nearly impossible to make pictures the way they are advertised...
1,Spectrascam,"Good thing my spouse actually tried one of these before Christmas, otherwise my kids would have thought Santa was playig a cruel joke. Sorry to say, but this product is an absolute zero. I could only imagine my kids frustration when they spent hours positioning each peg and then went insane when they bumped the board and had to start all over. Looks great until you try it. What was the manufacturer thinking!?!?"
1,Mother of six!,This product is awful. It works nothing like the advertisement or the picture on the box. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Very Disappointed - False Advertising,"I purchased this product because I thought my four year old daughter would love this item. I felt it was a great alternative to the Light Bright (no need to worry about pegs all over the house). Unfortunately, it doesn't work like the packaging cover or the commercial. It is nearly impossible to recreate the pictures displayed on the commercial. It's hard to see the lights and manipulate the spectra light board. Don't waste your time. You're better off purchasing the original Light Bright or Magna Doodle."
1,this has to be the biggest waste of money ever!!!,"My daughter was so excited by this toy that she had to have it, santa of course gets the toy, sad to say she is highly dissapointed, it doesnt work at all like it says, its not worth the money or any money for that matter, I plan on writing the company as well to complain, unless you like to see the face of a sweet innocent child be so sad and so dissapointed that you yourself want to cry, dont buy this toy.ps i wouldnt give this toy any stars at all if i didnt have to."
1,Walk on by this toy.,"I'm with the majority on this one, don't waste your money. The idea is good, the actual toy is the worst I've ever purchased. The lights are tiny little pointy lightbulbs that change color when moved up, down, or diagonal. They never all move the right way, and it's IMPOSSIBLE to get the whole screen to start out black. The stylus it comes with is useless, because the little lightbulbs bounce off it instead of all moving in one direction to acheieve one color. And after a minute of running your fingers across the lights, your fingers actually get sore! This is one Christmas present that's going right back to the store and getting exchanged for a large Magna-Doodle."
1,Disappointing Gift,My 4 yr. old daughter was awed with the Spectra Color on TV and asked Santa for one for Christmas! What a disappointment on Christmas morning when it did not perform as expected. The lights are very dim and hard to manipulate. I couldn't even make a recognizable picture myself! It's not at all like they advertised on TV!! We headed to the store today and exchanged it for Lincoln Logs!!
1,Spectracolor,This is not a very good toy. Imagine a toy you have to use in a dimly lit room - now that is a concept. This is how this toy is used. The pictures are not as defined as they show on the box. I am returning it! Let down of the year.
1,spectra-color,"When I purchased this toy, I looked to see that it was age appropriate. My granddaughter is 3 1/2 and like to draw so it seemed to be just right. When we opened the toy, we found that it is comprised of small very sharp lights that are supposed to be rolled either with your finger or a stylus. to one side to get the board all black. Then you are supposed to be able to draw pictures or follow the outlines to trace pictures. It was impossible for me (grandma) or my 13 yr old granddaughter to even get all the little lights to be all black. We tried to trace a picture and found it nearly impossible to get the little beady lights to work. It was one of the poorest toys I have ever purchased."
1,Could not be WORSE!!,My brother in law bought 2 of these for my daughters and they thought there were so cool (at first) that there were almost in tears when we found out they really DID NOT WORK AT ALL as advertised. I played with them for a while and there really is NO WAY to get a consistent color out of the little pegs. Luckily these were bought locally so they are both going back this week.
1,Spectra Color major disappointment,"My 5 year old was so disappointed that his first comment was ""why did they lie on T.V.?"" It works nothing like the commercial. It hurt my sons fingers to play with it. Would have given no star but was given the option."
4,Daughter liked it.,"My 9 year old daughter really liked it. It's similar to Lite Brite, but no little pieces to lose. She even makes other pictures that she didn't get stencils for."
1,Horrible,"My son received this toy for his birthday. It is the most horrible toy he ever received. There is no way that my son can make those pictures. As an adult, I could not make the pictures either. I am not sure what the pen is supposed to do. It works better using your fingers. My sisters son who is 18 mos old now has the toy. He likes to bang on it and watch it change colors.I would not recommend that anyone waste their money on this toy."
1,Please don't waste your money!!,"I bought this toy for my 3 1/2-year-old for christmas. He saw the pictures on the box and couldn't wait to try it. I was excited because it looked like something I would even enjoy playing with ( I'm a grown up kid and a kindergarten teacher). I placed the template on so he could make a house. My child got so frustrated that I read the box to see if we were doing something wrong. He could'nt get the little pegs to turn to the right colors no matter how hard he tried. Then I tried to make the pictures for him. I couldn't even get the pictures to look like they were supposed to. It is too hard to manipulate and is no fun for kids. If I hadn't torn the box up so badly when we opened it, I would have DEFINITELY taken it back. Now my younger son (2-years-old) just rubs his hands back and forth over it to see the colorful lights but he is bored in about 2 minutes. This is definitely the worst toy I've ever bought. TOY TRASH!!"
1,Don't even think of buying this toy.,"... Even an adult can not make this thing work. You can sort of push the pegs to one side or the other and get a color change but there is no way possible to get the toy to perform as the picture shows above. If I had bought this at an actual store instead of a website, this toy would have gone back to the store on 12/26. My kids were extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,great therapy device,"My daughter's Occupational Therapist has one of these. She found it in a bargain bin somewhere. It's fantastic for sensory therapy, even without the lights.It goes through batteries quickly, but is extremely durable. It's probably been beat on by hundreds of children and is still going strong."
1,Very Lame,"I was so excited when I saw this in the store so I requested that a friend buy it for my son's birthday. That was a big mistake. First of all, the recommended age is three years and up, but that is crazy. There is no way this toy is appropriate for anyone who doesn't have very nimble fingers and a whole lot of patience. Secondly, I know that boxes often make toys look a lot more exciting then they turn out to be, but this one is not even close. The colors turn out to be completely different from how they appear on the cover. In reality they are dull and barely detectable, not of the primary, vibrant sort shown on the box. And lastly, if you so much as touch this toy when you are done with your creation, you can kiss it goodbye. Any child will be heart broken, as mine was, once the ample time was taken to get it right."
1,Not what it's lit up to be!,"The commercials for the Spectrcolor make it look like a light up ""magnadoodle"". It is not easy to make a distinct picture on this toy! My 2 and 4 year olds received this for XMas. The 4 year old became very frustrated that he couldn't make a distinct picture. My husband and I had a hard time of it. It is even dfficult to make the screen all 1 color. The 2 year old liked to run his hands over it to watch the colors change, but running his hands over the pointed lights made his fingers raw. Don't waste your money! Buy a LightBrite!"
1,a true piece of crud,"Just to back up the other reviews, this toy is real junk. The surface is filled with little pegs and in theory you can push them up, down, left, right, and diagonally to get 8 different colors of light. What really happens is that when you run your finger over it in one directions, about half the pegs will change to the right color and the others will change to some other random color.It is impossible to draw a real picture on it even using the little pen that comes with it. I think this is the worst toy we have bought in 8 years. Run away, run away fast."
1,Not Happy,My son received this toy from his grandma.. It has given him very little enjoyment. It doesn't work that well and definately is not easy to use.. The battery cover on our unit will not even stay closed with the batteries in it. Plus I am unhappy to report that my other son ended up getting a blister on his finger from this toy. I am not sure if it was due to the heat given off from the toy or because he might of gotten his skin caught between the base of the unit and the lighted pegs.. but the harsh fact is due to that and the fact it doesn't work well I would not recommend this to anyone..I would recommend the older style light brights over this anytime.
1,You don't want this toy!!!,"This toy does nothing....lots of colored lights that wiggle back and forth on the screen....If you want to make the screen black you need to make sure all the pegs are pointed up. This is impossible because these pegs just wiggle back and forth and do nothing but change colors. You can not do anything with this toy, nothing like seen on TV. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this toy."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"My husband and I purchased this toy for our only child thinking that she would love it, but boy were we wrong. For weeks our four year old daughter could only talk about this toy, then we bought it and she did not even play with it for 5 minutes. This toy is not worth the $money$ we spent or the shelf space in stores. Please do not purchase this toy."
1,Very Disappointed,"I agree with everyone else. My review doesn't really need to be added, but I just had to get on here right after Christmas to get my frustrations out. I am very disappointed in the false advertisement. I will read these reviews from now on before I buy toys."
1,Spectra DudColor,I bought the Spectra Color for my three year old daughter for Christmas. WHAT a major waste! I will never buy anymore toys for her without checking the review first. This was a total waste of money. The ads are SO deceiving. You see no pretty butterfly and get rid of the worthless stylus. You and your child will be very disapointed if you purchase this product.
1,Don't buy this toy.,I agree with the other reviews that this toy is not worth the money. Not worth it for free either. I thought it would be great for my 3 year old son to be able to use his fingers to make the screen change colors but it doesn't even work for me and that stylus is worthless too. It is going back to the store today!
1,Not Worth It!!!,"I bought TWO of these for my daughters, what a mistake!!! It is nothing like the one on the commercial, it is very hard to use, even for an adult!! The pen that is provide to ""draw"" with is useless, this is a piece of junk that was quickly cast aside, I can only hope I can find the receipt to return it!!! Do not waste your money!!!"
1,HOW SAD!!,What a total piece of crap. Bought this item for my seven year old and was so disappointed on Christmas morning. I tried the stencils and couldn't even make a decent picture. I even tried replacing the batteries thinking that may be the problem. I can't believe Irwin Associates has the nerve the try and sell this item. What a perfect example of false advertising. For shame Irwin!!!
4,Good faucet,"The faucet is well priced, easy to install, and works well. My only complaint is that the lever action is rather stiff for turn on/off. Otherwise, a great value."
5,The 1930s romance of Bali as seen by the West.,"Having lived in Bali for two years, I must admit that I am a fan of their traditional music, the sounds played in every tourist shop, restaurant and even the hold music of international hotels. For Tabuh-tabuhan, Colin McPhee borrowed from these sounds and created the most harmonious combination of traditional Balinese music with Western symphony. Only Tabuh-tabuhan is from the 30s, the rest are from the 50s. Listen to this CD after reading McPhee's book, A House In Bali; it takes you back to a time that no longer exists in Bali."
2,Disappointing Reference for my particular research,"I can only comment on this reference as it was used for my research. I am writing a book about the versions of the Bible in English. In doing that I have compiled a list of about 1,587 individuals involved in revising, editing or translating different versions of the Bible. Of that number only 54 were listed in this reference. The majority of those listed were Catholics. This work was not very useful in my particular work."
4,Great product!,Great Product! It came in pristine order just like if you had bought it back in 1996 when it was manufactured.
4,Very good.,I wish it had some of my favorite songs and was longer.But without a doubt Strunz & Farah are the masters of the style.Even other guitarists that play in the same style would tell you that this guys are the best.I dont care much for the dancer and a few other things but this is the best next thing to a live show.
5,Love these songs!,"I ordered this after finding out that Jimmie Logsdon is in my family tree. These songs are very honestly some great examples of early country/Rock-a-billy music. Though some of the tracks towards the end of the cd are not the best quality, this still is a great cd to add to any country music enthusiast's collection!"
5,A Must Read For Chemists,"This is a an excellent biography of Linus Pauling presented in a way that provides insight into his tremendous range of contibutions to science and public policy. Many of the chapters include Pauling's own recollections as well as those of his many colleagues and students. As a scientist, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."
5,1960s soul/R&B fans rejoice!!!,"This set collects mid-1960s singles & rarities by (mostly) UK and (some) USA performers of (mostly danceable/uptempo) soul/R&B. Casual fans might not ""get it"" (no big US hits here) but hardcore fans of Motown/Chicago/Philly styles and NYC pop-soul (i.e., Chuck Jackson) styles will be in orbit over this! Granted, there are a few forgetable tunes amongst the lost gems but it's mostly a solid/super-fine listen throughout! NOTE: There's a pre-fame track by TOM JONES (who ALMOST got signed to Motown in the '60s)!!!"
4,Full of information:,This book has a lot of valuable information in it. I will be using it for a reference as I need help in my china painting. Also nice paintings and designs to go by.
5,Wonderful,"Sheila Southwell is a wonderful teacher and also she is a very, very good painter. She is honest in her opinions and very helpful for people who wants paint china/porcelain. And reading her book is also a pleasure! Thank you, Sheila."
3,A good book for beginners in learning to paint on china.,"This book was published in 1985 and has many good instructions for beginners in china painting. It was smaller than I thought it would be and many of the photos were in black and white. It was of average rating for me, but a useful book for it is handy for quick reference. I preferred ""Colorful China Painting"" by Barbara Duncan as it had step by step instructions with full color layouts. This book provides you with color sample palettes and you can obtain instructions on one fire only pieces. You cannot buy this book on Amazon and must go through China or Porcelain suppliers to buy it, but it is well worth the money. I went to [...] to buy mine."
2,Thin,"The only word to describe this bio is ""thin'. The book, at only 233 pages (paperback) lacks any real depth or thorough understanding of Palin. The author appears to have gone the easy route and just done a cut and paste of the wealth of material publicly available on the author, and jsut pursues the obvious themes."
4,"James Levine,the Met chorus and orchestra are the stars!",Dmitri Pittas gives a heartrending account in his lead tenor role. Mr. Lucic is a promising Verdi baritone. Ms. Guleghina seems past her vocal prime but gives a harrowing account of Lady Macbeth.
1,Save your money!,"This was one of the most disappointing of all the Met broadcasts. I love this opera, but this performance was extremely disappointing with lackluster singing and unimaginative sets."
3,Disappointing,"I absolutely ADORE Matt Wilson and John Munson too...but, this was a disappointment to me. John's voice sounds strong, but Matt's sounds weak and strained. I truly love 'em, but found this to be a disappointment, which breaks my heart because I wanted to love it."
1,"Intentionally bad, and they succeeded!","Apparently, the flops were conceived for a movie. I have not seen the movie. I've only listened to the CD. The premise of the movie is that the flops are bad. This CD reflects that.I'm a huge Matt Wilson & Trip Shakespeare fan. This CD contains his often silly lyrics, except that they are intentionally meaningless and so are just a string of weird phrases. The music is also intentionally sub-par. It might have worked for the movie, but it's not worth your money or time to listen to this CD.I'm sorry I didn't have better news because I really wanted to hear some good new music from these guys..."
3,The plight of a true Genius...,"Larry Heard has always been a complete inspiration to my soul. His music has always been at the forefront of my playlists. His new release ""Loosefingers"" was actually a bittersweet album for me though. The first half of the album is so pure and breezy; music to lose yourself into, but the second techno influenced half of the album was quite annoying and I feel bad saying this about his music because I am very much a devoted fan. My favorite tracks on the album are ""Deep Inside"", ""Spirit Sensitive"" and ""When Summer Comes"", all music that carries the vegetating vocal and breezy vibe that I expect from the Legend himself. Although, I felt a little robbed because I own longer versions of ""Deep Inside"" and ""When Summer Comes"" on vinyl and was expecting them on the CD. Please stick with your knockout punches on future releases, Larry! ;)"
3,Decent but not great,"I have been a fan of Larry Heard (aka Mr. Fingers) for well over a decade and own just about everything he has ever produced. I am a little dissappointed with this album as I feel he is still attempting to experiment with this more progressive/techno type sound. I wish he would just stick to the smooth jazzy dance tracks and vocals for which he most loved and recognized for before he ends up alienating his true fan base.That being said, I loved the first half of the album but got bored very quickly with the second half. My favorites are 'Deep inside' and 'Changes'"
3,Kind of 'German Depeche Mode',"This CD compilation is called ""Wolfsheim 87-95"" in Germany, featuring essentials of the 2-head-band. If you like synthpop with a dark flair, i.e. Depeche Mode, give it a try... Some tracks are remixed or extended (imo for the better) and have moved clearly to the 90's-sound. Carlos Peron (who assisted on early and recent Yello recordings) had a helping hand with his room-909-sample equipment and knowledge. Texts are mostly in english, a few in german, and all of them not of the usual easy-listening type."
5,Just listen it!,"A great band, the voice is so fine, so deep, the kind of voice that make me cry, if you like Depeche Mode, Clan of Xymox, Handfull of Snowdrops, you'll like Wolfsheim."
3,Pre-'Pesche personality,"Enjoyably dark if a little crude, the disc is a solid compilation of early dark industrial dance music which won't likely win over many new listeners but will come as a pleasant surprise for those invested in the history of the genre."
5,Beautiful earrings!!!,I love these earrings! They are extremely lightweight and very pretty. I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear them. Highly recommended!
3,okish,Look super cute but never seem to have them in stock. I have been checking since the beginning of the year but they still remain out of stock.
5,Gorgeous!!!,"These earring are cute! They look much more expensive - like white gold - than what they are actually worth. They are a perfect size since they are only 2 inches long (not too big and not too small - just flawless). These earring don't tug on the ears because they are super light weight, but are very noticeable due to the shine.Also, these earring have a young and fresh (super flirty!) look that are classy. They seem delicate, but are actually sturdy. I love how they dangle and move with me.I ordered these earring on the 7th and received them on the 12th. Great shipping and nicely packaged.BOTTOM LINE: WELL WORTH THE BUY AND VERY BEAUTIFUL!!!"
3,"Cute earrings, but plating rubs off.","I've had these earrings for almost a year now, so take that into consideration, but I've noticed in the past few months, the plating has been rubbing off, revealing a bronzy color beneath. These are still my favorite earrings, and I wear them maybe once a week (I usually forget to put earrings in), but I'm becoming more self-conscious the more the silver wears off and may have to retire them soon.It seems to just be occurring through normal wear; I don't wear a lot of makeup, and when I do, it's all-natural, so I can only guess that the oils of the skin on my neck are slowly wearing away the silver.That's just my personal experience with them, but if you're considering these earrings, please keep that in mind."
5,nice sliver,"WOW, JUST GOT MY EARINGS !! I LOVEM!! PRETTY PRETTY PRETTY!! SHINNY SLIVER!! WILL UPDATE IN A FEW WEEKS LETS SEE WHAT PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEY SEE THEM ON ME!! I HAVE GOTTEN ALOT OF EARINGS FROM AMAZON AND LOVED THEM ALL !!"
3,Great intro to VB.Net but poor certification prep,"If you are new to Visual Basic.Net then this book is great for getting a basic understanding of the language. If you are using it to introduce yourself to the language then I would highly recommend it. However, this book miserably fails its' title in preparing for the 70-306 exam.The best thing the book does is to provide you an outline of what to study for the exam but you will need to do further research on the topics with MSDN. Plus, as other reviewers have stated, there are a few errors throughout the book most notably on the practice tests. But, for an intro study I would not let the errors turn you away from it.The bottom line is the book is not detailed enough for the exam but a good introduction, especially, for college students taking a VB.Net course."
2,Frustrating,"This book is chalk full of errors. I am not at all convinced that anyone went back through and actually tried to reproduce the examples and assignments found in this book. If you like a challenge and enjoy debugging someone else's code, this is the book for you. If, however, you feel that your time is better spent actually studying for the exam I would skip this book."
5,Al's still got it,Classic Al Kooper. Somewhat overproduced but show me an Al Kooper album that isn't.
3,"Cute, Funny and entertaining.... But leaves you wanting more",I didnt realize this book was so thin.... Its an ok book but dont expect too much writing.. it def leaves you wanting more... But then again im not a big britney fan my friend is so i just borrowed hers... I say if you like the movie and are looking for more get the DVD dont get this... its not worth it... unless you want to see pics of britney that repeat whats in the movie or find out what she learned about the camera on her day shoot... end result? keep your money
1,QUIT IT!!!,"What is the publishing world coming to? What happened to good books and authors, such as Flannery O' Connor, V.C. Andrews, and William Faulkner? Sure, they're all dead and all, but what happened to all the good writers? Is it all coming to an end? How could trash by this gal be considered literature? Britney writes like a little kid and just because she's a big ""star"" doesn't mean she deserves to be published more than the people who work their butts off writing real literature. Gawd, what a bookshelf hog. And book deal hog, at that. She's taking over everything; next thing you know, she's going to be running for prez. Hopefully that won't happen..."
1,Heifetz caricatured,"For fun, for laughs, listen to this ... but know that finally you will spill a tear. What did Heifetz do to deserve this caricature???"
2,some things should stay lost,"It isn't difficult to see why Heifetz avoided recording many of these transcriptions. Why was it so important that Ms. Kloss record the banal Gluck ""Sonata"", the painfully awful Debussy ""La Puerta del Vino"" (in which she sounds like an 8 year old during her first recital), and the ghastly Ravel ""Forlane""? Compounding my displeasure was Ms. Kloss' overly harsh tone throughout this program. The Master would not be pleased."
3,Progressive for its time...,"...but kind of dull for ours. This book, dealing with an unmarried young pregnant woman who has an abortion must have been quite racy back in 1961 when it was first published. By today's standards though, its quite weak. There are too many things in the story that are implied or glossed over. Additionally, the heroine seemed quite detached from the goings on around her. There was nothing about this character that made you care what happened to her one way or another. Set in New Orleans and on the Mississippi Gulf Coast I did like reading about the places she went since they were so close to home. It was a quick read, but not one I am likely to recommend to others."
4,"Sad journey, psychological treat","Shirley Ann Grau's protagonist Joan Mitchell ventures into an eventful, observable passage after one date. Her loneliness and ongoing existence lead her to realize the essentials in life.The scene settings are done marvelously.A great read=)"
2,Not good,Difficult for kid to take it after sticking . Tearing out. Dip in water becomes totally useless.waste of money.totally dissatisfied.
5,Kassie DePaiva's - No Regrets,"This CD will have you tapping your toes the whole time you listen to it. I loved Kassie's first CD Naked, but No Regrets is even better. It is fun and lively and makes you want to get up and dance. Even the ballads have a beat. Kassie has a wonderful country voice and I look forward to more from her soon. I highly recommend No Regrets to any country music fans."
2,great concept but faulty,"I agree this piece is ideal for certain track layouts, but the fact that the trains don't stay in the grooves (either the battery powered trains or the long trains pushed manually by my 2-year old) causes my son great frustration."
4,Riffing on Thule,"Vollmann can be difficult to read, but this book is worth a little effort. What makes this work interesting is the verbal jazzing of original sources from Icelandic saga, history, travel accounts, scholarship, Arctic folklore, and a little contemporary personal experience. This book is what might happen if Magnus Magnusson had brain fever--a phantasmagoric recreation of the North. What made this book enjoyable to me was the fact that I'm familiar with most of the sources and I appreciate the blends, melds, extrapolations, and abuses that Vollmann perpetuates on them. I'm not sure how this book would come across to someone without this background, but if nothing else they wouldn't be bored."
3,Historical Epic Vollmann style,"Vollmann takes his first full length stab at historical writing with an epic proportion. The genesis-style delineation of events leading up to his main story becomes tedious and drawn, but Vollmann's style can perhaps entertain you until the mid-point of the novel when his real story begins. The nordic adventuring is set against a Vollmann adventurer, getting his feet wet in the cold surroundings of the north atlantic. A good start to a much better series."
4,Meets my expectations,I received this item quickly and in discreet packaging. It is sleek and has decent power. This item meets my expectations. I only wish the buttons to change it from mode to mode were a little more user friendly and that shipping did not cost more than the item.
3,good for price,"In general I like it, though it didn't come with anything helpful like instructions. At first, I thought it was defective because I put in the battery and nothing happened. About half an hour later, it whirred to life.While it is fun and has decent power, I think my body doesn't like the material it is made out of, so will be having to take protective measures from possible allergic reactions or something, because I definitely enjoy the sensations when it's not becoming painful.For the price? Worth it."
3,Bare Minimum,"Batteries and instructions are NOT included, but I figured out it uses one AA battery. Smells weird and feels kind of sticky, the weird smell/stickiness will get on your hand if you hold it briefly. But at this price I think it was still worth it."
2,Doesn't do the trick,for me anyway. Too loud and doesn't vibrate as much as I would have liked it to. Don't buy it.
4,quik/safe/secret delivery ..prd is wrkin,its a gud quik and very discrete delivery. Product is gud...b u wud require a gud jelly to use it....njoy..u can buy it
2,Are you kidding ?,"I have been a bounty hunter for two years, before that I was in the Marine Corps. We have captured over 1300 fugitives in the two years I have been with the company. Mr. Armstrong tends to give alot of dis-information in this book, from stats and techniques to right out breaking the law with some of his methods. After reading the book I'm still trying to figure out if he is stretching the truth or recounting stories from Renegade. The book is entertaining, but more so for those who are not professionals."
3,"Be for real,,,,,,,",I found this book hard to believe. He makes the capture of some of the most hardened criminals seem simply too easy. This book will go over well with anyone not willing to question some of the stories that he is pushing.Joshua does an oversimplistic job of explaining all of societies problem. He never really goes into detail about solving any of them.... just keeps complaining about how noone is willing to evolve to stellar manhood.He also does a not so subtle job of pushing ancient egyptian philosophy or some would say occultic practices. Whatever helps him to do his job....It's a nice read but don't take it too seriously.The book will make for a good movie because most of it is pretty far-fetched.
1,Blown after 4 or 5 uses in 6 months,"Bought this sub in Dec, when I first received it worked great, watched a total of four movies with it and yesterday turned it on and blows fuses. So I figure its under warranty, yeah. Well I read the warranty, I have to ship it to NY, 25.00 bucks and enclose a 15.00 check for return shipping, . I only paid 79.00 for the thing so I opted to buy a POLK from new egg for 99.00. Pyle of ___p is right. To the guy that says we are wrong, if you just got it, just wait.. it'll blow, soon....for your sake, I hope you got a good one but I doubt it."
2,Not very informative,"Be warned: Cubase LE Demystified is geared heavily toward users of Presonus gear. If you are using Cubase LE with a different interface, you might find this annoying. I did.Overall, it's a decent DVD tutorial if you are an absolute beginner. The production value is pretty awful, however; even the DVD menus look like they were a high school project. Anyone above a complete novice user will find much of the DVD redundant. For the $20-30 you'll spend on this DVD, look elsewhere for instruction."
5,You rock Andrew!,"I absolutely love this book! I've been a chronic neck and back pain sufferer for more than 7 years and this book has really saved my life. No more am I trying to explain how to adjust my back based on what feels like my I've read the book cover to cover. It's a permenant fixture on my coffee table now! Thanks for writing a practical, hands on, fix to my pain!"
1,Running around like a headless chicken just about sums it up,"I am so happy to see that I am far from being the first to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Anne Elliot. It is not the actor's fault, for sure. As a matter of fact, I thought the physique of Sally Hawkins suited my imagination of Anne Elliot the best out of all 3 I have seen. Yet, the way she was directed was horrendous. She is constantly running after Captain Wentworth (and not only in the last ten minutes, what about the concert scene?). I also much preferred the older Captain Wentworth (played by Ciaran Hinds). He seemed to show a lot more emotion while still staying true to Wentworth's steely character. Finally, why on earth was this one cut so short? We hardly saw anything pass between the main 2 characters and the cousin Mr. Elliot character was just a silhouette in the background. Very odd and poorly done."
2,I can't believe BBC was a part of this version!,"The fact that the cast is better looking in this '08 version cannot make up for the complete meltdown of the story in the second half of this version. The first half of the movie is true to the book. Once Anne arrives in Bath, the story strays away from Jane Austen's novel. Anne's friend Mrs. Smith and her vital role is completely diminished and you barely even realize who she is, since she isn't an invalid in this movie either. Also one of my favorite parts of this whole story is skipped, Wentworth doesn't ever write Anne a hurried letter containing his true feelings. I don't understand why they couldn't have tacked on 20 more minutes and made this version live up to Austen's novel. Very poor adaptation!"
1,Why???,"That is the question I had after watching this. Why, when there is a beautifully done movie-length version already in existence (Persuasion), was this made? I was very excited to hear about The Complete Jane Austen project, and was happy to see from the previews that the casting looked age-appropriate. I was hoping that the stories would each be shown in several episodes to allow for character and plot development. What a sad, sad disappointment this adaptation was. No one who hasn't read the novel and/or seen the 1995 version would understand from *this* version why Persuasion has so many devoted fans. While the misinterpretation of Anne could partly be blamed on Ms. Hawkins' choices, the bulk of the missteps of this production are due to poor adapting and directing. It's a shame; the cast is talented (based on seeing many of them in previous endeavors), and would have benefitted from a better project."
4,Well done - I enjoyed it!!,Good story - true to the novel and very good acting by the two leads. Excellent writing.
2,Disapointing,I was very disapointed in this version of Persuasion. The interesting characters were not developed. Nothing that made the book so delightful came through in this version of the movie.
1,Pathetic Offering,"Anyone who has viewed the 5-star masterpiece of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in their portrayal of this love story will surely know how truncated this depiction was. Poorly done, poorly directed, poorly acted. Devoid of any true depth of feeling. What a sad portrayal of Captain Wentworth in particular."
1,Absolutely Hideous,"I had been looking forward to Masterpiece Theatre's ""The Complete Jane Austen"" for several months, and was especially excited they chose to begin with ""Persuasion"", which is my favorite Austen novel. I could not have been more disappointed. Seriously, the only good thing to say about the film is I only wasted 90 minutes of my life. The script was atrocious - they cut much of the story out, and the bits they did keep, although the correct conversation(s), were between the wrong people. There was no chemistry at all between Anne and Wentworth, the characters did not feel developed at all, in short, it was ghastly. On the other hand, the 1995 BBC version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is its polar opposite - never a false step, superb casting, tightly woven script, magical chemistry between Anne and Wentworth. If you're looking for a film of ""Persuasion"", the 1995 one is the only one worth viewing."
1,A terrible shame. Don't waste your time.,"As a long time Jane Austen fan, I bought this thinking it couldn't be as bad as some of the reviews suggest. Boy, was I wrong.I don't know what the producers could have been thinking. They turned Anne into a weepy dishrag! And their Captain Wentworth may look nice but he doesn't look like a sailor. He looks more like a rich landowner's son who never had to do a day's hard labor in his life. He would have made a good Mr. Elliot actually. The rest of the character's in the story have been similarly skewed. And I was horrified by the changes that were made to the plot. They actually took out the most romantic scene in the whole story!If you want to see the real story ofPersuasion, please get the 1995 version starring Amanda Root. It is a far superior adaptation in every way. Don't bother with this travesty."
1,Not Persuaded either!,"I agree with ""Eileen"" who has not read the Austen stories, but knows all the films. She gave one star and so do I, only because I was able to watch it through...just.I , in contrast, have read the stories, and Persuasion is my favourite. Watching this new abridged and adapted version, I had to wonder why MT bothered at all. The feeling of the piece in no way evokes the intimacy of the story. It has a remote tableau-esque objectivity, jarringly punctuated with overwrought carryings on. The hyperventilating panic-attack characterisation of Anne is terribly distracting.I too recommend the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Root version, which truly portrays the fine subtlety ,intimate poignancy, and reserved intensity which are so vital to the fabric and feel of Austen's original story."
5,An Austen fan must see,"I own a copy of Pesuasion with Amanda Root, which is very good. But this! This version is by far my favorite. I agree, the Austen purist will probably hate it. But this version is so very well done, and in my opinion, a much better version than the other (Root version). the last scene in which Anne accepts the Captain's proposal, i back it up and watch it over and over and over again! This version i do not own, i keep checking it out from my local library. It's on my amazon wish list and I will buy it soon. Men these days don't have a clue what sets a true romantic's heart to racing. I was surely born 150 years too late. And I agree with another poster, this captain wentworth is smokin hot which makes it that much better."
2,Jane Austen would object . . .,"Attractive actors, sets, costumes and a great score, but outside of those elements a veritable disappointment! The film does not portray the characters in a way that is consistent with Austen's own depiction. Anne is whiny and timid. Wentworth is inarticulate and, at one point, actually confused to find that he has been flirting with Luisa Musgrove. The Crofts, sensible and smart in other versions, are similarly confused and bland in this one.Austen would never have countenanced a heroine of hers running a marathon around Bath because she can't master her feelings or a pround hero who gives in so easily. . .she might enjoy certain scenes and scenery in the movie but she would not have recognized this film as her own story."
3,Not as good as the 1995 BBC production,"If I hadn't seen the 1995 BBC production of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Claran Hines, I would have enjoyed this endeavor better. However, between the two, the 1995 production is a much better movie.The first time I saw either production was on Masterpiece Theatre. Although I purchased the 1995 version mentioned above right after seeing it, and have enjoying watching it many times, I am not planning on buying this version. Don't get me wrong, this movie is also good and many will enjoy it. I just like the portrayal of the characters in the Amanda Root and Claran Hines production better."
2,Watch the Amanda Root Version,"""Persuasion"" is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I was excited to see a Masterpiece adaptation on PBS. Unfortunately, I found this version dull and dismal. I didn't feel that the film makers adaquately portrayed why these two characters were in love or why he would wait to be married all of these years. In the lovely 1995 version, you see the underlying humor, will, and strength of character in Anne. Frederick and Anne also have exchanges that reveal their passion for one another. While it also takes liberty with some of the original story - I've always wanted to see the drama with her widow friend included more - it is definitely more moving and better developed. I would recommend bypassing this Masterpiece version."
1,Dreadful Rendition,"Please do not waste your money. The actors are dour, lifeless, and constantly stare into the camera. It quickly becomes annoying. They have pointlessly rearranged dialogue from the book so, for example, Wentworth makes an idiot of himself describing the woman he would marry in front of a crowd of people. Even more annoying at the beginning and the end of the movie they have Anne running marathons through her house and the streets of Bath. Did anyone read the book or even the Cliff Notes to get the point about persuasion? Guess not. For some reason they have taken out all of the wit and insight of Jane Austen and left you with some soggy melodramatic sop. Run, do not walk, to the nearest bookstore and buy the book or, if you want a video, there is a very solid and more faithful rendition from 1995 as mentioned earlier."
2,A little to brief...and not quite the thing,"I loved the earlier version of Persuasion and was prepared to like this newer version. After all the BBC re-do of Pride and Prejudice was far superior to the 70s version. Alas, it just seemed too rushed and too compacted. If you didn't know the story or the family dynamics, you won't learn them from this film. I like the actors, but the screenplay leaves a lot to be desired.The music is nice. Even if you are not a Jane Austen purist, see the Amanda Roots version to really enjoy Persuasion."
2,I don't like the fact that my disc would not play,This version of Persuasion is my favorite. I have no complaint about the acting or the story. The disappointment of not being able to see any picture or have any sound is my complaint. I went though the process of returning the disc through Amazon and it worked. I was pleased to get responsive emails and a speedy refund. Thank you Amazon.
3,"If you loe Jane Austen stuff, worth seeing, otherwise pass","I was expecting much better, the older version of Persuasion is something I have owned for a long time and I wanted this one to see the story, which I love, performed again and perhaps differently. I was especially put off with the running around the city of Bath in the final scene.But, all in all, it tells the story that Jane wrote and that is why I purchased it.I love all things Jane and this is something I shall keep and view again, but after watching the older version and this one back to back, I have to say that one is best. <3"
2,Changes the feel of the story,"I was so disappointed in this film. I love the Amanda Root version, and was hoping for another great adaptation, with a newer look. This version changed so many events to try to make it more dramatic. I guess it succeeded in the added drama, but in so doing it changed the mood of the story. The whole movie up until the very end focused on the sad and serious aspects of the story. You never get to see Anne start to open up and come alive again the more she's around Captain Wentworth and other friends and seeing more of the world. This lack of emotional evolution bothers me so much more than all the changes in events. Even if you've never read the book, I wouldn't recommend this one-tone movie."
2,Horrific,"I own the earlier Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciarin Hinds. It's beautifully acted and filmed. This version fell flat for me very quickly. I like Penry-Jones in Spooks and the BBC's Cambridge Spies immensely. I did not care for him in this role. I can't pin down exactly why, but I simply didn't feel he was right for the part....to distant, unemotional, even nonverbally, facially. Granted, Hinds, who can be explosive when he acts, was also very contained, but Jones here did NOT come across as contained, rather as nonresponsive much of this film. Overall, I felt none of the actors were that strong; the pacing also dragged with this version to me. If you want the film, buy the earlier BBC Persuasion!"
2,Disappointing,"I love Persuasion--it's one of my favorite of Jane Austen's. So I was looking forward to this version since I'm not a huge fan of the Amanda Root version.But is it too much to ask that they try to follow Jane Austen's story line? Since it holds together? I was going along with it until the end when I realized there's no motivation for how the characters are acting. Because they didn't follow the story line--misplacing conversations and events.If you aren't a huge Persuasion fan and you are a fan of costume drama, this might work for you. But if you love the book, don't get your hopes up. And go watch Pride and Prejudice."
4,"Passion, not Accuracy","Persuasion is the story of a second chance at love. The two main characters are meeting again years after a painful breakup. Much of the dramatic appeal comes from the fact that the friends and family surrounding them seem oblivious to the pain each is suffering. This BBC production is only an hour and a half long, which obviously means it has to leave some details from the book out (and actually changes a couple of points).I own three different versions of Persuasion and I love this one because of the passion shown between the two characters, but it is the one farthest from the actual classic novel by Jane Austen. However, it is definitely worth the money for the high entertainment value."
2,Persuasion - Masterpiece Theatre,"This version of Persuasion is not my favorite. This actress can't compare to Amanda Root, though this Captain Wentworth is handsome. There are two scenes that are so out of the Edwardiarn era that I can't justify liking this film version. When Anne Elliot runs around town looking for Captain Wentworth, I nearly laughed until I cried. No respectable woman of that time period would ever carry on that way in public, let alone in private. In addition, there is a ridiculous 5 minute unrequited kiss that is absurd! I felt like saying, ""Oh, get on with it!"" All in all, not my favorite film version of Persuasion."
3,Ending spoils the rest of the film.,"Not only was Anne Eliot running all over Bath totally out of character and unnecessary to the story, the fairy tale ending of Wentworth bringing her back to her childhood estate was totally impossible. He could not have afforded to buy it or maintain it on what he would have made in the war. And the character in the book would have been happy in a much smaller place.I've seen this a few times. Although the 1995 Amanda Root version is much better, this has some charms. They had to compress parts of the plot to fit the 90 minutes. That I could have accepted if the ending had been true. There was no reason to make Anne run through the streets ! That detracts from the entire production.Sally Hawkins gave a sensative portrayal, but the Anne of the book was stronger."
3,Not what I expected.....,"I really love Jane Austen's books and I think BBC normally does an amazing job with the series. I have watched BBC's new versions of Emma and Sense and Sensibility and LOVED them. They are by far my favorite movies of the books. So I naturally thought Persuasion would be amazing too because BBC has been doing such a great job at updating their versions of the books. However, that is not the case. I found that this movies was way too short. I felt I had no idea what was happening. The story was jumping all over the place. I just don't understand why they didn't put the time into the movie and make it longer. We will watch a three, four, or even a six our movie/series because normally they are just that great!! What happened here?? I just don't know."
3,More than just the running didn't make sense...,"I really do enjoy watching Jane Austen screen adaptations, and for the most part, this was okay. Maybe it was because I knew that there were other things going on in the story, that when it ended, I couldn't feel satisfied. Nothing was resolved other than Anne's romance with Wentworth. I went so far as to look for 'deleted scenes' from the special feature section of the DVD - and then discovered that there was none. That was disappointing as well.Yes, the last 10 minutes were very strange, and left me entirely unsatisfied with how it ended. I know what happens *in the book* and in other versions, though, so it's not as if I was left totally in the dark.In fairness, each rendition of any of Austen's books needs to be a bit different than that which has come before. Some of this version's experiments worked better than others."
3,The Last Ten Minutes!,"I am a Jane Austen fan, but I don't mind new adaptations. This one confused me. The last ten minutes horrified me. Otherwise, worth watching."
2,Stick with the 1995 version,"This adaptation was disappointing, with the characters not really coming to life. Everyone seemed rather leaden, actually. Anne's 'race' around Bath at the end was totally unbelievable, and the kiss between Anne and Wentworth was staged so awkwardly that I nearly fast forwarded through it -- not pretty to look at. And what's up with Wentworth buying Kellynch for her at the end? Stick to the 1995 version -- it was tons better!"
5,Persuasion,I love this movie! I thought that it was beautifuly filmed... the whole thing is just lovely! Great chick flick!!
5,"Not the book, but still a great movie","This movie is not the novel but I found it to be a great love story in its own right. It is one of my favorite movies to curl up on the couch to watch. The ending comes too quickly, it feels as though they are rushing to tie up the story...maybe that is because of all the running she does through Bath at the end. The sister Mary is over played, as others have mentioned, but in some ways I find this humorous...she is the sister you truly want to role your eyes at and say OMG! If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy the movie, if you are a die hard Austen fan looking for the novel, you will be disappointed."
3,Disappointing adaptation of a classic tale,"I agree with several other reviewers who stated that, while the actors chosen for the roles did an excellent job and seemed to visually ""fit"" their characters, the screenplay was oversimplified and, in terms of the ending, totally changed. I found it hard to follow parts of the story, although I know it well, because what I felt to be key ""links"" and parts were left out or glossed over. I still feel that, of all the versions I have have seen, the 1995-1996 version with Amanda Root is far more of an accurate and honest adaptation. I would not buy this Masterpiece Theater version for my home video/DVD library, though I am a big fan of Masterpiece Theater in general."
1,One of the worst adaptations,"The movie lacked real emotions. All the acting and actors were dull and nothing about the whole thing was aspiring. ""Persuasion"" is one of my favorite novels by Jane Austen but not even that was enough encouragement for me to root for this poorly portrayed couple (Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth). I must admit the 1995 version of Persuasion staring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is my favorite and maybe I had too many high expectations this version would also be wonderful but I was very disappointed. I think I knew I would have a problem with this movie from one of the earliest scenes of a maid doing nothing more than just standing around holding an inkwell waiting for when Anne needed ink from wondering from room to room making a list of the house items. What was the point?"
2,"""Shreds and Patches""","This is a poor man's version of Austen's late masterpiece. Full of odd cuts, misrepresentations, and a generally rushed job feeling throughout, this adaptation makes one wonder who considered it worthy to film in the first place. Some of the Complete Jane Austen entries, after all, will be repeats of earlier TV versions, and the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds ""Persuasion"" of several years back is in all respects infinitely superior to this mishmash. The closest equivalent to what has been done here to a great work is what the Reader's Digest routinely used to do when it would blithely maim a novel of merit and then foist it upon the general public as ""a Condensed Book."""
1,COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY VERSION.,"NONE OF THE VERSIONS OF ""PERSUASION"" IS AS TRUE TO THE BOOK, TO AUSTEN, AND TO THE TIME PERIOD AS THE COLIN FIRTH ""PRIDE AND PREJUDICE"", BUT THIS IS THE LEAST SATISFACTORY OF ALL.ANNE ELIOT IS NOT A TEARY NONENTITY, ELIZABETH IS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE ANNE'S MOTHER, ETC., ETC. UNFORTUNATELY, ALL OF THE PREVIOUS CRITICISMS WERE JUSTIFIED!"
2,Ho Hum,"This movie takes FOREVER to end. The near miss of every situation leaves me too frustrated. She doesn't speak up until the very end and frankly by then I don't give a ...... Extremely slow and I just don't think the movie shows enough previous history between the two leading up to me caring if they get back together or not. I haven't read the book, but feel it must be much more exciting. I fast forwarded the part at the end when she runs and runs and runs and runs...good grief!! It's almost comical. The acting is good (thus 2 stars), the story is not."
2,Nowhere near as good as previous productions,"In order to be different from previous productions, the director has decided to make the female lead a shopkeepers daughter rather than a Baronet's daughter. She seems to be in pain all the time, the costumers appear to have decided that two or three outfits (dowdy ones at that!) were adequate and that the director thought it was perfectly normal to have a Baronet's daughter sprinting the streets of bath as though a pack of dogs were after her.If one wants an elegant production, one that matches the novel then I recommend the 1971 BBC version."
2,Eh,"I have never read the book nor finished watching the 95 version, but even I could tell that this was a majorly abridged version of Persuasion. It just felt way too short. The acting was fine I suppose, if not bland. And the ending was just so sudden and awkward. I agree with the reviews that mentioned the running around scene, and agree that NO proper woman of that era would ever do that. Just very awkward."
1,Have they ever read Jane Austen,"This movie was a complete disappointment. it left me wondering one thing, have the creator's of this film ever read or watched Persuasion. What was the point of hitting the shuffle button on one of the most beautiful plots ever written. They completely took any meaning away from Wentworth's letter and mixed up the plot so much the to create drama they had Anne Elliot running all through bath. The ending seemed forced."
2,A disappointing simplification of a sublime ending,"I agree with the most recent reviewers. The screenwriter chose to substitute the sublime denouement written by Austen with a most un-Austen-like, undignified chase around Bath, culminating in a public kiss -- Jane would have been mortified! I'm not a purist if the change improves the product, but this one doesn't. Perhaps the screenwriter shouldn't have aspired to best Austen."
2,Not worth it.....,"This version of Persuasian was at times silly (Anne running all over Bath looking for Wentworth - Oh Please... how un-Jane Austen can you get.) and unfaithful to the book. The acting was pretty bad too....The costumes were wonderful, so was the music.The 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds was much better and was faithful to the book."
4,Good Persuasion,I thought this movie was really good but I have to agree that the last 10 minutes was not very good mainly because the camera shots move in and out to fast while Anne is running. There are shots where the camera is not so close and several side views of her are taken running are not so bad. I think 10 minutes of poor take should not affect the entire movie so I rated it with four stars. I think both Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones are good actors.
4,Watch it more than once,"First I just want to say that I have read the book and love it. Second, I am realistic and know that they have to adapt a book in order to make it into a movie.With that said I really did enjoy it. As a person who enjoys movies, it was well done. I personally didn't care for the shaking of the camera but I know its some type of artistic spin so whatever.Wentworth was amazing (not to mention hot). I didn't really care for Anne's character at first but she grew on me.I really recommend watching more than once because the more I watch it, the more I love it."
2,Not true to character,"I am an avid fan of Jane Austen's works. As such, I am very forgiving of any version of her work that will gain her a greater audience. However, this screenplay so totally changes the character of Anne Elliot that she is hardly recognizable to those who have read the book. Anne was perhaps Jane's ideal woman, yet this screenplay makes her a pathetic silly woman and it's quite hard to believe her capable of attracting anyone's interest, or maintaining it over a span of many years. Too bad we can't hear Jane's critique of this adaptation. I'm sure it would be quite caustic."
4,Great remake of a Jane Austen classic.,This Masterpiece production was another great example of their quality work. The soundtrack is great. Most of the actors are enjoyable to watch. This version has an edgy feel to it that I enjoyed. And finally the ending brings more closure than the previous version of Persuasion. All in all it is very enjoyable.
2,Jane Austen would denounce this film production!,"PersuasionThis film production of Persuasion is so disappointing that I believe Jane Austen would denounce it if she were alive today. The screenwriter and film director clearly did not understand the story characters in this Jane Austen story. They turned Anne (the heroine) into a weepy, desperate & emotional basket-case instead of portraying her as a self-confident (in a quiet way), dignified, and full of common sense. A number of the support characters were so marginalized that it weakened and oversimplified the story. My recommendation is to go with the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds film production which is about the best we'll ever see."
2,What a terrible waste!,"""Persuasion"" is one of my absolute favorite Jane Austen stories but this adaptation is just insulting. The character of Anne is completely misrepresented! In this version, she is so spiritless and dull it's impossible to imagine how Captain Wentworth could ever have fallen in love with her in the first place, let alone carry a torch for her for almost a decade! And though the gentleman playing Wentworth is handsome, he lacks charisma and doesn't leave much of an impression. The costumes and sets were quite attractive though, it's just a shame they were wasted on such a terrible production. If you must see every Jane Austen adaptation ever made, just rent this one, because purchasing it would be a mistake."
5,Persuasion,"I love this version of Persuasion! I think it is beautifully done. I wish it were longer. I love Sally as Anne, she does a great job and she is lovely. I highly recommend the movie to anyone that loves Persuasion the book.Spoiler Alert!!!!!As for the last ten minutes where Anne is running around the city looking for Captain Wentworth, I loved it. Maybe that is not what a lady would have done back then but if I had been seperated 8 years from the man I loved with all my heart I would run after him too."
2,What was this?,"Another Masterpiece Theatre production where I ended up thinking, ""huh?"" (I felt the same way about ""Woman in White""). And I just saw an excellent MT adaptation of Jane Eyre so I'm amazed at how bad this production was. The lead actors--Rupert Penry Jones and Sally Hawkins-- had no chemistry and I didn't believe they had been pining for each other for the last eight years. The camera angles were annoying and I hated the way Anne would speak directly to the camera--it was too campy and out of place. And I didn't like this Anne nearly as much as Amanda Root's potrayal--in the 1995 production Anne was quiet but smart and strong and dignified, nothing like the Anne in the MT version who seemed silly and weepy and so so weak. And don't even get me started on the ending and that laughable kiss. I was glad it was only 90 minutes long."
2,please watch the 1995 version instead of this one,"I was very disappointed in this version of one of my favorite Jane Austen books. When Anne repeatedly looks directly into the camera, it felt like I was back on Gilligan's Island and the Skipper was doing one of his looks. Offputting. The cast was fine and I thought Sally's acting was pretty much on target-besides the disconcerting glances at the audience. She really was able to give the emotion to Anne she needed, although her personality seemed a bit more martyrish than I would like. The 1995 version was much better overall, in involving you in the life of the characters, and I felt much more true to the book than this version."
2,"ok, but could have been so much better","Having been a Jane Austen fan for years, I was really looking forward to this movie. Persuasion is one of my favorite books, and I have read it many times. However, the movie left a lot to be desired. While the whole film was rushed and out of order, the ending was the worse. Why try to cram everything in in the last 10 minutes? The ending made little sense; it had unnecessary additions, way to much running, and a LAME kiss.The book ending is perfect, so why they strayed so far from that is beyond me. While that actors where much more enjoyable to watch then in the 1995 version, I would have preferred that they stay with the book. The movie lost much of the Jane Austen wit and charm."
4,Quick fix for the desperate Austen fan,"Ok, it's not perfect, but what the hey. The sets and costumes are beautiful, definitely, 5 stars for location shooting(Thanks BBC!), the main actors are good (the father is great), and all and all, love lost-love found reigns again in the heart of us true romantics. My main complaint is it's too short, and the climax is a little crazy, but you have to love the shots of Bath's 'Crescent'."
4,Miss Austen,"Loved this movie, seems to move very quickly thru the story but is put together very well. Well cast and lovely Brit. countryside...makes me homesick!!!!!!!"
2,Very disappointing!,"This story was presented so briefly that anybody having not read the book a number of times would be totally lost. There is not enough of the book in it to even give clues to events portrayed! Relationships are not portrayed as in the book...everybody gets a long far too well. Casting seemed to be well enough, but the story line lacked enough depth to convey the plot along. I was so looking forward to this, especially after watching Sense & Sensibility, which was superbly done!"
1,"Too Bad, So Sad","I am ""all astonishment"" that the BBC could film such a version of Persuasion. No chemistry between Anne and Captain Wentworth, no suspense in the relationship between Anne and Mr. Elliot, no character development, and the end, which in the book was romantic and satisfying was a total let down. Buy the Amanda Root 1995 movie. It is much truer to the spirit of the book."
2,Too much unsteady cam,The main complaint I have with this film is its photography. I don't know how they did it but it was like they attached a frame to the actors with a camera on it and shot several scenes like that. The result was like the actors were disconnected from the scene and the shots were jerky. I got a headache just watching them.The idea of girl of the lower nobility running all over bath with out being horribly out breath is ludicrous.Aside from that Anthony Head was excellent as a member of the aristocracy. The rest of the cast were good. The plot was OK even if it wasn't conventional though I didn't care for the Anne's looking into the camera in several shots.
2,Not a snob,"This is a disappointment. No, I am not a ""snob"". Why on earth did they not change Sally Hawkin's hair to make it softer and more appealing as time moves forward in the film? Anne Elliott is supposed to have a ""second spring of youth and beauty"". Sally Hawkin's is youthful but she never achieved a modicum of loveliness, there was no change in her look from beginning to end. As other reviewers have noted, her sister Elizabeth is supposed to be very pretty also. With the great costuming and sets, why not complete the picture Jane Austen painted and have the characters look the part?"
2,Sacrifices character and plot development for cheesy gimmicks.,"The hotness of Rupert P-J is the only thing this version of Persuasion has going for it. Horrific, distracting acting in some key supporting roles (such as Charles and Mary Musgrove) is part of the problem, but worse is that this adaptation chooses long moments of Sally Hawkins staring meaningfully into the camera over actual development of the characters and advancement of the plot. The 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds does a much better job of capturing the mood of the book and is infinitely more engaging. Rent this one (or catch it on tv) for the eye candy if you like, but buy the earlier one for repeat viewing."
5,Beautiful take on Jane Austen's classic,"Of the six or seven BBC classics I have seen, this one is special on the grounds that it is, independently from the literary original, a extraordinarily well made film. Five stars to the people who created this fabulous film! The film music is also amazing."
5,new addition to my Austen movie favorites,"Love, love, love it! Sally Hawkins is phenomenal as Ms. Eliot. The emotions that she conveys without words seem to jump from the screen. This quite easily make its way to the top of the Austen best of list. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves good writing, great acting, and beautiful storylines. 5 stars.If you like this you also may enjoy the 2007 Sense and Sensibilty as well."
5,Very Sweet!,"Before I bought the movie, I read the reviews on it. I have to admit, after some of them I was scared to buy it fearing that it would be a total disappointment. However, I went for it anyways! And I am SO pleased that I did!! It was incredibly sweet and appealing! The actors did a terrific job of putting you in the moment, especially through the tension and sadness of the events. In fact I love this movie so much, I am now back on the amazon.com site to buy a copy for my mom for mother's day!... Yes! It's that good!"
1,Lost Art,"This version of Jane Austen's classic, is so far from a well produced drama that it doesn't merit being called drama. Not because of the acting but because the script, directing and sequencing in an attempt to modernize and shorten results in a movie that is difficult to follow, whose characters seem shallow and within a short time, you think to yourself, why am I watching this bollix of a film in the first place. Watch the Amanda Root version, much better, true to the story and a classic that warrants your time!"
1,Piece of Trash,"Where to start? First, the case arrived cracked (damaged in shipping) so I opened the plastic to survey the damage and found a big crack down the inside of it. Well, I decided to give it one more shot and go with a three strikes your out basis and it struck out! This movie sucked! I could barely stay awake through the boring and uneventful dialouge, the way it dragged through each scene like a snail and whoever complained about her running through the streets at the end being the only bad part was crazy. This whole movie was slow, poorly casted and all-in-all a complete flop. Have you not seen Pride and Prejudice? Becoming Jane? The Inheritance? Anything but this...!"
1,Ciaran Hinds version is better,"I was very disappointed in this new version. All the characters were bland. Very unfaithful to the book.If you are a Jane Austen fan and are a purist, I recommend the Ciaran Hinds version which is much, much better."
2,Buy the 1995 Version,"I like many other avid Austen fans was thrilled to see that a new version of Persuasion was to air on the local PBS channel. Although the PBS version was edited, I doubt that anything could truly save this movie. Outside of the beautiful scenery and music, this version lacked all the charm of the 1995 movie with Hinds and Root. It was so greatly altered from the book, the story was almost unrecognizable. It was a tremendous disappointment."
4,Persuaded to like this one!,"On initial review, all I could do was compare this film to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, and so I was less than objective. However, this film is NOT that other version and needs to be reviewed and weighted on its own merits. It does follow the storyline rather well, and while some scenes do seem a bit rushed, it is still true to the heart of this moving story.Upon a 2nd and third viewing, I found the film rather charming, the acting good, the scenery and sets excellent. So, I would recommend this film. I think it is especially good for someone new to Jane Austen, but I feel that even Jane Austen fans will come to appreciate the film if they can but give it a chance."
2,Worst of Two Worlds,"Presenting a simplified version of a novel widely regarded as a masterpiece of English literature is not a meritless idea: though we understand that especially the development of character may be diminished or compromised, it may be worth it to get the essentials across. To present a simplified version of a novel which is an out-of-order, jumbled, misshapen, meaningless shadow of the original is a disservice to all who watch it. It neither helps us understand the infrastructure of the original novel, nor is it a worthwhile piece of art in itself. This production represents a total failure of engagement; it's a piece of cotton candy. Watch the 1995 Amanda Root version, as close to perfection as a filmed version of an Austen novel has gotten so far.(Will no one ever cast a version of ""Persuasion"" in which the heroine's sister Elizabeth really is beautiful?)"
4,I really enjoyed this version,"I really enjoyed this version of Persuasion. Looking at Rupert Penry-Jones, was, well, he's hot, hot, hot. Anyway, they could have cast Elizabeth better (traded her with Mrs. Clay even)."
2,Persuasion,"This was a disappointment, the lead role Anne was odd looking and her hair and clothes drab. The filming of this movie was also disappointing, far to many close ups and odd camera angles which didn't do justice to the beautiful homes and locations."
2,A Little Flat,"I was disappointed in this movie. I found the storyline hard to follow, and often the dialog was spoken so fast that I could not decipher what the actors were saying. And, I know it's a side issue, but I was really put off by the hairdo of the heroine. She never seemed really appealing enough to draw the hero's attention. I wanted to like this movie, but I just could not get there."
1,Terrible rendition,I'm not going to repeat what other reviewers who have also given this production of Persuasion 1 star have said - they have been exactly right - I'm only adding my one star to bring the rating down as a whole. I pre-ordered this sight-unseen based on other British productions of Jane Austen which have at least striven for authenticity. Watching this version of Persuasion was truly horrible and my copy is going into circulation as a used version to keep people who don't know better from buying directly from the producers.
2,No chemistry,"Although this version is easier to follow than the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hines edition, I really did not care for it. It moved too fast, and just wasn't as believable. Did not care for Rupert-Penry Jones as Captain Wentworth.Glimpses into Anne's thoughts and diaries really help viewers understand the intricacies of her relationship with Wentworth, but there just wasn't any chemistry in the film.Glad we bought the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hines version."
3,Slow romance ends happily after,"The romance builds at an exceedingly slow pace. Since the story is told from Anne Elliott's side and in keeping with the strict protocols of British manners, you're not even sure that Captain Wentworth still cares for her until close to the end. She is not a pretty heroine, but her fine acting draws you in and you feel her anguish. As for the Captain, he's so gosh-darn handsome and plays his part well. He acts indifferently, but eventually reveals his passion. All's well that ends well. I'd live to give the movie 3.5 stars."
1,Disappointing,"A new adopter of Jane Austen fiction, I recently went on a campaign to watch every adaptation of my favorite novels. After watching the 1995 version of Persuasion, I must say that I am very disappointed in this recent take. Although I wish the 1995 actors were as handsome as those portrayed in the 2007 version, the 1995 adaptation is much more fluid and romantic. The actors portray the characters very well and look natural.Although the cinematography is better in the 2007 version, it seemed very stilted and focused more on the facial expressions of each actor rather than the actual storyline. I feel it is rushed and disjointed. The music is a bit dramatic and the acting is overdone.If you are interested in purchasing this film and have not seen it yet, I highly suggest you rent it first (along with the 1995 version) and come to your own conclusion. I am glad I did not purchase it in haste."
2,Bland and Boring Compared to 1995 Version,"Having recently watched the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version of Persuasion on PBS, I consider myself fortunate not to have invested in its purchase. Compared to the 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds, Persuasion 2007's script leaves much to be desired. The actors were another problem; they just seemed to put very little emotion into their characters. While watching the current one, I kept asking myself if I would have understood the depth of Austen's story had I not been familiar with the 1995 version and the answer was no. Do yourself a favor and skip Persuasion 2007 and purchase the wonderfully produced Pursuasion 1995.Persuasion"
4,The score is incredible,"I just watched this version of Persuasion for the second time. The person who arranged the music deserves an award (maybe they did?). Sally Hawkins also deserves accolades for her performance. Even though the film is not true to the book, both the music and Ms. Hawkins make this version of Persuasion an enjoyable way to spend an evening."
4,Persuasion-A Year Later,"I watched the DVD of this version of Persuasion recently and realized that it indeed has redeeming qualities. Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins did well with the material they were given. Anne's long, unrequited love was beautifully played out by Hawkins, as was the bitter rejection of Captain Wentworth by Penry-Jones. I continue to be disapointed with the script of this version of Persuasion, but the outdoor scenes were rich with the English countryside. I believe this movie deserves a positive review for those things that were done well-actingPersuasion, costumes, cinematography, music, and the interior scenes."
3,Decent,"I agree with many of the reviews that the last 10 minutes went horribly wrong. That said, this was a very watchable version.Make no mistake though- This does not hold a candle to the Amanda Root/Ciarin Hinds version. I don't care if Root and Hinds had been twice the age that they were when they made their version- They were both far superior in their roles than Hawkins/Penry-Jones. Cirian Hinds in particular wrapped up the definitive take on Captain Wentworth.BTW, I'm assuming that all of the comments on what a hunk Penry-Jones is are coming from English viewers. Penry-Jones is not by any means a bad looking fellow. However, I think he could only be labelled a ""hunk"" by English standards for physical attractiveness. Good looks or not, he simply did not have the ""gravitas"" of Hinds (IMO)."
1,OUCH,"It is hard to imagine why anyone would make a film of Jane Austen's Persuasion without any respect for the majesty of her words. This production pales in comparison to the complexity of the book and serves as a reminder of how wonderful the 1995 film staring Amanda Root was.Just a couple thoughts: no well-bred young woman would run wildly through the streets, certainly not Anne Elliot. And why have the book end with Wentworth purchasing Kellynch? Isn't the reason that Mr. Elliot is in the book because he is going to inherit the entailed property and wants to insure any way he can that nothing comes between him and his inheritance? He courts Mrs. Clay because he thinks that Sir Elliot may marry her and produce a new heir who could then inherit in his stead. The ending was just plain dumb. This film lacks the tenderness, the thoughtfulness, and the regret that are the hallmarks of the story."
4,So Good,"reading Persuasion for me was dificult but i did cause i love Austen books. now watching this live and so very well acted, I'm totally transported to the book. its sweet and lovely.I think its ver dificult the task adaptating the book to a movie. but this its a Wonderfull adaptation. i love it, i get nervous, happpy and suffer with every thing that happend to this carracters.then after i finish the movie, i go back to the book and then back to the movie."
1,Unprofessional,"I must admit that I didn't get very far into this film. I could not believe that the director chose to go with a hand-held, shaky camera. So we're supposed to believe this is some kind of reality show?! If you're fairly blind to cinematography, you might like this thing, but otherwise avoid it..especially if hand-held camera makes you sick. It's sad that cinematogaphy is getting so unprofessional in so many movies, especially on television. We're entering a dark age."
5,Roll Away by Davy Knowles Back Door Slam,"For anyone who likes the blues,rock,alt.rock: then Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam is the group for you. they maybe young of age but you can't tell by the way they play. lance"
5,One word...Awsome!,This band rocks! I love this album and will be looking forward to their other albums in the future.
5,The torch has been passed,These blokes are awesome. They're playing the club circuit these days but it may not be long before they're doing amphitheaters and arenas so see them while you still can in an intimate venue. This album is everything I expected and then some--unplugged to my delight.
5,Making the best of getting back to basics,"""Roll Away"" - Backdoor Slam's first release is a very satisfying drink of fresh water in world of brackish recycled runoff. This power trio takes the idea of blues/rock back to its origins. They play it straight and they play it right. The musicianship is exceptional. The vocals are clear. The lyrics are understandable and the groove is tight. If you are a fan of ""Cream"" at its journeyman best, you will love Backdoor Slam. I hope to hear more from them. Buy this CD!"
2,A/C Adapter Review,"I was happy the the product showed up earlier than expected, and while it did work, it didn't work as well as I thought it might. I'm using it on a 96 Audi A4 with the 12v V6 motor. The threads are not cut with the appropriate depth, so when I was tightening the adapter down it sheared threads. Thus I wasn't able to charge my A/C system. I bought another one locally(which I tried one time before with no luck) and this time used some teflon tape. That took care of the thread depth problem and the adapter works pretty good, except for the fact that one has to hold pressure on the adapter to get a proper charge reading.In short, it gets the job done with some adaption and fussing with."
5,Kolchak Pretty Good,"These Kolchak comics are good, if you are a fan of the television series. These are some of the stories of the TV series that never have been aired in this book."
5,Boca Beth is the Best,We love Boca Beth!!! My daughter Samantha loves all the music. She loves to sing and what a gift to know she is learning while she is doing it. What a wonderful feeling to have your child come to you and tell you she knows when her birthday is and when you ask her When? She tells you in Spanish. Money can't buy that!!! Thank you Boca Beth
2,this cd is close to useless,"from what i can tell, this cd is sung by folks who are not native spanish speakers, and it's unfortunate to miss the accent that comes with listening to songs sung in spanish. it's nice that the made-up songs are to tunes american kids already know, but younger children (pre-school aged) who are native english speakers trying to learn or get acquainted with spanish do not find this an especially helpful selling point to connect them with the songs on this cd. it's a good try, but i would keep looking for other/different music to introduce your youngsters to spanish vocabulary."
1,The music is mind-numbing.,The music will drive any adult insane in a short amount of time. It is not at all original and does not make my children want to learn Spanish. The translations are cliche and the lyrics are not at all clever.
2,Not good for squeaky doors indoors,"I'm sure this product might be good for garage doors and other things where it doesn't really matter if you make a bit of a mess, but for oiling for example a squaking living room door, this is not the product you want. Even with the straw it makes too much of a mess."
3,"Some good Moeller instruction, but the rest? Meh!","I bought this book after seeing some online videos of this guy demonstrating various Moeller techniques... I thought the book would go into more detail, but I think the videos actually cover more than the book... The first section of the book gives some good insights into basic technique, (Moeller stroke & other similar approaches), that has helped me to rethink my fundamentals... but the rest of the book is pretty dry and seems geared to jazz... to tell you the truth I have not been able to work my way through it, as it is just not exciting enough. Recommended for the most studious of drum academeticians."
2,What a waste of a good gift certificate!,"I am not completely giving this 1 star, as I do feel the product itself is sleek, simple and full of useful features.However, the anti-skip is HORRIBLY sensitive. I have found very few conditions under which I can play a CD without it needing ESP. This includes positions in which it is completely still! Often times, I can start to play a CD with no problem, but over time it will start to need ESP more to play, and eventually stop playing altogether. From there, it's pretty much useless to try and play the CD - the unit will barely read it.This has been tested with multiple CD's, all in perfect shape, some brand new.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! These things are not very attractive anymore because of the electronic memory units, but I wanted something that I could still hook up to my car until I can afford a real replacement for my CD deck. I guess I should have saved up!"
2,Coby MP-CD561 MP3 CD Player,"I have had nothing but trouble trying to make this player work. I ordered it specifically to listen to the entire New Testament on an MP3 CD. I have tried many times to make it work and can only get the beginning or the end. I had a friend try it and she made it work and search for the proper spot on the CD and showed me how. Now when I try, I still can't get it to go to the spot on the CD where I wish to listen. It is not user-friendly."
1,Too p.c. for my taste,"I rarely stop reading a book partway through, but I've made an exception in this case. This novel drips with political correctness and with a pro- illegal alien sentiment. My neighborhood is too damaged by the influx of illegal aliens to be sympathetic to Hall's view in this novel. Too bad, because I generally enjoy her novels. But DEFINITELY NOT this one."
2,okay,My son loves eating saimin with mommmy and trying to eat sushi. He's three so chopticks just don't do it for him yet. So I bought these. They were my second choice because the chop stick trainers wouldn't ship to hawaii for some reason. I don't really care for these and neither does my son. If anything it discourages him from using them. One has to have just the right tension when grabing the object or the chopstickswill cross and the food will fly or if too soft a touch the food won't make it to ones mouth. When I get back to San Diego I'm getting the better one.
4,Cheater Chops,"The kids like them. I doubt that they could really help anyone learn to use real chopsticks because the technique for holding real ones is much different than the fakes. Small kids might find it difficult to squeeze the chops together, but the grips on the sticks make food easy to pick up if they can squeeze them together. Each one has a different animal on it so the kids will be able to tell their own from someone else's. They clean easily in the dishwasher or by hand. My husband STILL won't use chopsticks!"
4,They get the job done...,"These are good starter chopsticks for little ones who want to learn but just don't have the coordination yet. The ends are a bit thin which makes them a bit slippy, but for fine motor skill development, they are perfect. My 3 and 5 year old love them and I use them in my preschool for pre-writing development too."
4,my 12 yr old loves them,"I bought these for my grandkids for xmas. My 12 year old grandaughter uses them almost daily, She has broken a couple of them but they are inexpensive and I ordered her another pack. She has one set here and another at home. She like them better than regular chopsticks and if it makes it fun to eat maybe she eats better."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought these chopsticks for my 4.5 year old. I am not very pleased with them because they are too flexible at the tip to hold food securely, but too stiff at the top to easily bend. I think these would be better if the entire thing were not made out of the same material, or if the tips were a bit thicker.My daughter has broken two already without being incredibly rough. These were just not a good purchase."
2,not very strong,These sticks are not very strong ( the plastic is really flexible at the tips) making it difficult even for an adult to use... I would try something different as my kids are getting really frustrated with these.
1,Chopsticks,I bought these hoping to learn to use chopsticks but sadly they are much to pliable to be used. They won't hold anything since they bend. A waste of money.
5,chop sticks,This is a fun products for the kids and adults alike that can not use the traditional chop sticks. They wash up quick and look just as good as new. Would buy again
3,Fun for party.,"Ordered 8 packs for kids party. Liked that they were lead, phthalate and BPA free. Nice for price. A little big for small hands and not easy to use for adults, not the greatest way of learning and holding a real chopstick. Have to hold them like tongs to pick up food."
4,Great Party Favors,"These chopsticks made great party favors for my daughters 1st birthday that was asian themed. The chopsticks include one design of either panda, dragon, fish, or butterfly. This is perfect for boys or girls. I will admit that the chopsticks are not super stiff, there is some flex to them when you pinch it together but overall they work fine for little fingers. My daughter hasn't tried them out yet because she doesn't quite get the concept. I tried to use them and thought they were pretty good for the price you pay. While their maybe sturdier trainer chopsticks out there, I think these make a great start."
2,Coffee Table Book,"This is a glitzy compendium of items related to the Jungian concept of Shadow. The poems, brief articles, pictures and photos are nice but not terribly informative. There are many other books out that will give you more."
3,A Reasonable Guide at a Reasonable Price,"For the camper traveling around the Eastern Seaboard, Anderson's is a useful resource. It is targeted to motorized journeys; the self-propelled would be better served elsewhere. The sections covering state, county, and national parks are welcome, useful, and often unavailable in other RV guides.While listings are extensive, they do not cover all campgrounds in a given state. Maps and indexing system are adequate, although occasionally frustrating because of a seemingly random numbering scheme.As with most other RV guides, Anderson's is partially fueled by advertising revenue. The ads are grouped together in their own section, which is less distracting than some competing formats.Not great literature, nor does it pretend to be. It works well for what it is."
3,Okay,"Again, bought this book for discussion at Book Club. The age of the book had me thinking it was post-hippy era."
2,Hooked On First Book,"I could not put this book down! I did not want it to end, yet could not wait to run out and find her other books. I did find them, I've read all of them and eagerly await ""All Fall Down"". I will buy this as soon as it is on the bookshelves.PLEASE write fast Erica, because you are great!"
5,Fantastic!!,Once Again Erica captivated my attention with her story line. She has such a way of weaving the characters lives together. I have read everything Erica has ever written. I feel she writes better and better with every book. I can hardly wait for what's next!
2,Nothing special.,"Spindler is a good writer, but there are many stereotypes and cliches in this story. There's the spoiled poor little rich girl trying to make it in the bluecollar world, a sweet, almost saintly poor woman who married into money, and a one dimensional nutcase stalking everybody. And the names like Julianna Starr, John Powers, and Luke Dallas made me laugh. I thought names like that appeared only on daytime dramas! There were a couple of twists and turns here and there, but the book was too predictable for my taste. Not a bad book, but nothing special."
1,Terrible book-readers should expect more from authors!,"I read this book based on the rave reviews by readers at Amazon. I feel cheated. Readers should expect more from authors. This was a cookie-cutter thriller. It was all wrapped up too nicely. You could see the authors outline at every turn. Golly, we need someone with insight into the lives of professional killers--How about having the wife/husbands best friend be an author? Great idea!Thrillers should be twisting and page turners, and surprises should happen when you least expect it! To say nothing for the neat and UNCLIMACTIC ending...one lousy chapter of a finale--and the COPS shoot him down? Ridiculous!For a REAL thriller that excites, try: Balducci; Meltzer, North Patterson; Diehl; Martini or Archer. Leave this ""write-by-the numbers"" author alone with her books."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This was the first Erica Spindler novel i've ever read, I have now begun reading all of her books. If you enjoy reading intrigue this book is for you. You can't help but get involved with the characters in this book. Adoption is a hot topic along with all the feelings adoptive parents go thru during and after a closed adoption. All of their worst fears come to light in this story. One never knows what baggage a birth mother may have in her closet!"
5,Cause for Praise,"This book really held my interest, it was hard to put down. Although it could use some editing, all in all it was a great read.If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this book should fill the bill."
5,Masterclass in suspense,"Kate and Richard Ryan adopt an infant, Emma - the final accessory to their already perfect life at the edge of Lake Pontchartrain. The child's birth mother, Julianna Starr, has a crush on Richard and inveigles herself into a job in his firm. Julianna is on the run from John Powers, a CIA assassin who has gone rogue, and who has been molesting Julianna since she was ten. Meanwhile, Kate still has feelings for Luke Dallas, novelist, who she might have married instead of Richard.With this simple story, Spindler delivers edge-of-the seat suspense, and it never lets up until the end.The characters and their motivations are credible, and the backdrop and scene-setting is first class.Enjoyed it immensely."
5,Great read,"This book is by an author I enjoy but I couldn't find it anywhere until I looked on Amazon. The seller shipped quickly and the book, even used, was in like-new condition. I don't hesitate to buy from Amazon sellers. All of my experiences have been very good."
5,Wonderful,I love everything I have read by Erica Spindler. THis book has many twists and turns that you don't want to stop reading it.
4,how tall is this,how tall is this grind rail? i would really like to know. what are the height adjustments as well. Please comment
4,Vagabond,Cornwell book is a very readable follow up to his initial book of the series. He gives you an insight into life style and customs of the times. His characters are believable
1,Party Cooler,"Ordered one and it didn't work. Returned it and received a replacement, and it arrived in damaged condition. It was certainly not worth the money and effort."
4,item description,"i'm looking for a pair of the tan ones, does anyone know if the coyote tan knee pads are actually tan? the picture shows od green. thanks."
4,not the best for my job,"Bought these for when I have to crawl into the belly of am airplane to load baggage, the curved shape if the plastic on the front makes it kinda hard to balance, and the material had absolutely zero grip on the plastic lined floor. I had to put strips of black duct tape on them so I don't slide around to much. These would be good for a swat team costume"
4,Hatch XTAC,"First off, the picture is misleading. HATCH does not make these knee pads in Woodland digital, which shown in the swatch. The digital they are talking about is ACU Digital, that is what I received. When I contacted the seller about it, they said HATCH supplied them with the photo and were willing to take back the knee pads.BUT, these knee pads are excellent. They are comfortable, sturdy and very well made. They do not slip when running (they have a neoprene pod on the inside to prevent slipping. Once you adjust the velcro straps to the correct size, the quick attach clips are very easy and quick to use.I sewed Digital woodland fabric onto these knee pads so they are now the color I wanted. It was a pain, but now I have the color I wanted and on a great knee pad."
4,"Comfortable, color off",These knee pads are very comfortable and seem to be highly durable. I have only owned them for a few days and have not yet put them through a hard use situation but they seem like they will hold up.Some things to consider are.1. I selected the coyote tan option knowing they are probably O.D. green. So I wasn't surprised when I open them and they where O.D. Green.2. They are Velcro adjustable with an elastic band. There are only three Velcro squares that you can adjust too. I put mine on the smallest which suites me just fine but I can see a problem for someone that wants a little looser.With those things in mind they are great pads.
5,The best British interpreter of Liszt of the XX Century!,"At the time of taking stock of the greatest pianists of the century in the vast territory Liszt, the name of John Ogdon usually flowing almost unconsciously. I would argue that Ogdon was the British pianist who better performed the Hungarian composer during the XX century .He possessed the grace, charm and magic to express the romantic rapture but stern and demanding mainly Liszt.The bass notes through an impressive left hand to remind me Nyíregyházi Ervin, Louis Kentner and Gyorgy Sandor, Hungarian probably the three best pianists of the past century.This recording was made by Ogdon because of the upcoming centenary of Liszt's death in 1986, and remains a valuable musical document of inestimable historic and artistic value. So, I recommend wholeheartedly the adqusisicion this album."
5,Our favored commonwealth,"The ""Portrait of America"" series by Kathleen Thompson is a wonderful introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. In this case, however, Ms. Thompson steps off the mainland and off the continent to visit America's largest and most famous commonwealth. The book, like all others in this series, is broken down into sections like ""History"", ""Culture"", ""Economy"" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. The section on the mass emigration to the U.S. during the 50s and 60s will be of interest to many students, especially those in urban areas. My only reservation is that the History section should have focused more attention on the ancient civilizations that flourished on this island over the centuries.This book, as well as the entire ""Portrait of America"" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."
3,how much fun is super glue?,This must be an automated web feature without human direction.I have never considered glue as a fun toy but the product was and worked as stated.( it is about twice for what you can get at hobbyshops
4,Probably more like 4 1/2 stars,"This novel is great. I was very impressed with Ford's poetic style of storytelling. Very spoken wordish, however injected very gracefully into the book. I was constantly getting annoyed with Michael, but then I had to remind myself that she was a self-described ""nut"". Without being very specific about time and place, Ford manages to create a very full novel. I will definitely be reading her other novel ""Rising"", and look forward to more from her in the future."
4,Cant Stop Craving!!,"Thats what it boils down to. Craving what you dont have aka the grass is always greener. i found it interesting to read this very well written piece of literary work detailing the innermost thoughts of a womans heart, which we all know carries more than our share of secrets. i wanted to advise Michael because it was clear when she was about to bang her head up against a wall, she fell in love with the concept of being in love so much that she allowed alot of men to enter her life, had she been thinking with her brain and not her cravings, she would not have let enter her world. we watch her enter into relationships doomed from the word go and react to rejection so typically of what we are used to. she sunk and i mean she sank but the moral of the story is that we as women do crave but we must do so with great caution so as not to cheapen ourselves or create these kinds of emotional scars which can be passed on through generations."
4,Thought she was talking to me....,"I absolutely loved this book because of how well I related to the story. I think alot of young black girls who yearn for love but instead end up pregnant are looking for what Michael has struggled through. Her story, yes while sometimes a bit melodramatic, is one that I have personally experienced and many of my friends have gone through. While reading, I thought, ""is Darnella Ford talking to me?"" in the same way that a preacher's sermon might strike a chord with you."
5,Crave,You can feel her pain as she searches for what she had all along. Her writing in expressiveI READ THIS BOOK TWICE
4,Fun and educational,Simple play rules + educational + lots of laughs = a win for our family (9 and 12 year olds)
2,didn't keep interest,"Based on the reviews, we purchased this game, but our family w/teens didn't find it sustained interest for long. Trying to build humorous sentences versus accurate sentences was part of the problem."
2,Makes people angry,"In theory, this game is great. My family got this game last Christmas though and each time we've tried to play together, at least one player has gotten angry and/or hurt. The thing is that you have to argue against people's contributions and some people don't take that well."
3,teacher,"I bought this for 7th graders. Will use it in our classes to support learning how to build sentences, etc."
2,Not for the faint of heart!,"I bought this scanner after researching several models - primarily Microtek and HP. It seemed to have all the features I wanted, was reasonably priced, received great reviews, and had a one year warranty. That's as good as it got. The scanner may have produced good results but I was so lost in the program I was too frustrated to appreciate it. I'm an experienced computer user but I found Microtek's program extremely confusing and difficult to navigate. Not having quantities of spare time (or desire)to devote to learning it I returned it and purchased the HP 3570c the very next day. A HUGE improvement!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time.....,"Purchased Microtek ScanMaker 4850 in spite of reading all of the not so favorable reviews. I should have taken the reviews ""very"" seriously. I wasted alot of time installing and uninstalling the software because it just would not responding to my OPS, XP...Dell Computer, 512MB. Take the reviews seriously and don't waste your time!!!!"
1,Don't waste your time with this scanner!!,"This is,hands down, the most worthless piece of equipment I've ever had the misfortune to buy. Yeah, the reviews were pretty good and it has all the features I was looking for but, it refuses to work. The software is hard to navigate and, most of the time, locks my computer. Windows XP can't find the scanner. I give up. I've owned this pos for over a year and have yet to get one scan from it. Their website is equally useless. Do yourself a favor and look at HP or some other brand that actually functions. Now I have another money losing thing to try to dispose of."
2,What a pain...,"I received this as a gift from my husband for Xmas '02 to replace my Visioneer flatbed that had started to scan in funny colors. Let me say that I really loved my Visioneer. First of all, the scanner installed pretty easily, no problems there. But... when I reboot XP, it takes 60 seconds just to boot the scanner before most of my other programs can load. Also, you have to manually open the ScanMaker 5 program and click the scanner control button and then close out of the program to get the light to go off. I wouldn't ever buy another one of these. I've also had a big problem with lint inside the machine under the glass, causing big problems with clean scans. I've tried about everything I can think of and still have the problem. I've even cleaned the glass on both sides with alcohol and newspaper! What a rip off. My advice is to stay far away from Microtek products."
1,Microtek service is the worst I have ever seen,"I bought a Microtek scanner a year and a half ago, and have had to send it in twice for repair. It has been not working or being repaired for most of it's life. I have barely had any use out of it. Now that it is out of warrantee, and never been fixed correctly, Microtek is trying to charge me $...-$..., plus shipping, to repair it again. When they didn't fix it right the first two times it was supposedly repaired. They have constantly gave me the run around, and will not replace the bad scanner. Buyer Beware!! This company does NOT take care of it's customers."
2,Don't make same mistake I did - this is NOT same thing as Miss Dior Cherie,"Not the fault of the vendor, but I didn't realize that Miss Dior was not the same thing as Miss Dior Cherie. I had bought a bottle of Miss Dior Cherie at Sephora and loved it then bought this when I ran out...not realizing there was another perfume by a similar name. This is more of an old lady scent whereas Miss Dior Cherie is a lot ""younger"" and sweeter. I already opened the package (it wasn't until I smelled it that I realized my mistake) so now I am out the $. :("
1,Not as represented.,"Although the ad did say the packaging may be different from the picture, it did not say that it is ""Originale"", a completely different fragrance from the one pictured. It wasn't inexpensive on top of being disappointing."
1,This is disgusting,"I realize it says the packaging may be different, but mine isn't anything even close. And it smells terrible! It isn't just my body chemistry, either. I tried some of this on at Macy's and adored it. This bottle I received in the mail doesn't have even a hint of floral. I feel like I'm spraying on patchouli-scented Old Spice. I can't wear it, and I can't even give it away. I guess I am just hosed out of too much money. I will not be buying fragrances online anymore, that's for sure."
2,Perfume not up to snuff,I will not buy perfume from an online vendor in the future. I am spending a lot of money and the smell last as if they are watered down fragrances. You even have to watch the stores for counterfeits anymore. I have used this fragrance for 20 years and never had it fade like the recents bottle smell does.
1,Simply no fun,"I was intrigued by this game winning the ""game of the year award"", and it is fun to play, until you've played it about 8 times then you will never want to play it again. It's just not very compelling. I believe it is now ""end of life"" so I guess I'm not alone in my opinion."
1,A must-read! Never-ending laughter,"Morse Peckham is dreary, dull, confused and very smug about all this, and he wants you to read his fittingly masturbatory pamphlet. This book pretty much epitomizes everything that is laughable and reprehensible about philosophy, both in its justification of the status quo and in its relentless silencing of real people's lives. Don't miss the incredibly funny ""definition"" of talking in the first chapter.A++ would lol again!"
5,Clean and entertaining,I read this book for a school assignment and found it extremely easy to read and entertaining. The author has a fantastic imagination and the story gets very interesting specially beyond the second half of the book. Mr. Klein has a clean style and gracefully tells the story of Paul Sant with a beautiful depiction of images and an appealing choice of scenery. I enjoyed it. The book has been nominated for a few fantasy awards.I was pleased by the outcome.It's altruistic and exhilarating.Recommended.
4,Excellent & entertaining,This book kept me entertained from start to finish. True fantasy with CS Lewis stylings. A very hopeful and wonderfully told tale.
3,Over The Hill,"'36 Hours' was suposedly a suspense film hanging on the premise that a military man, who knows about the Allied Invasion plans, will crack up under Nazi subterfuge, which I will not bother to detail, it all being so silly. The problem is that the real outcome is known to us all. It was sort of like the wrong Twilight Zone script got through somehow before anyone at the studio realized that the basic premise was just plain dumb. The movie tanked at the time, and rightfully so. I remember catching it on a double bill in a big city downtown movie house - obviously the studio knew it did not have a First Run release in their hands, and dumped it. Dimitri Tiomkin was really getting beyond his better days as a major composer, and his music shows it. His score here is repetitive and uninspired - he obviously had the experience to know a turkey when he was assigned one. Not his shining hour, I regret to say. Only for the purists who want to collect everything from ""the golden era""."
1,Arrived Broken,"Needed, note that I needed*, not just wanted, this product, and it arrived to me with the glass broken! I can't even use it for the intentions of a heat source because without the glass the candle holder is loose and swings upside down! And SOMEONE knew the product was ruined because they had already wrapped a single layer of bubblewrap around the lantern's open face box (not the box it was shipped in) and had written ""Damaged"" on it! I am severely disappointed and angry about this. I needed a candle lantern specifically because I can't go around carting or affording oil for oil lanterns, or keroscene, and I need a lantern mainly for the warmth it provides in a small tent! So, THANK YOU so very much for this waste of my money and time! Eight dollars may not seem like alot but it still pisses me off. I don't care how little an item costs, I expect to receive it in one piece!"
4,A Private Affair,"It was ok. The only reason I purchased this movie is because I'm a fan of Vanessa Bell Calloway. I've seen better BET movies. Regardless, I purchased it and added it to my ongoing African American dvd collection."
5,Beautiful work by a fabulous company!,"I have long been an admirer of Baerris's beautiful work, and when I received a pair of the macassar ebony hair forks as a gift recently I was taken aback. Despite being in the middle of cooking thanksgiving dinner I immediately took down my hair and put in the hair forks and crowed about them non-stop. They are gorgeous, light, and comfortable, and they held my hair very securely all day. These forks are so beautiful and I am sure I will continue to enjoy them for years to come. The packaging and careful instructions were very helpful, and I will definitely be a repeat customer!"
5,An excellent first textbook in Anaesthetics.,"This book is well-presented, easy to read and, with the case scenarios presented at the end of each chapter, puts some of the most important clinical considerations in anaesthetics into a truly practical way. It is relatively small too, so that it is portable and can be referenced easily. All in all, an excellent book."
3,Not as Useful as Others,"We were required to buy this book, but since the first day of class, instructors keep saying it is ""not comprehensive enough,"" and ""doesn't go into the necessary depth."" Basically, this book is good for a quick and dirty summary, but it is definitely not a replacement for Miller, Barash, etc. Save your money!"
5,Excellent!,"I bought this CD in Borders under the ""Discovery"" rack, knowing absolutely nothing about the artist. This is by far the best impulse buy I've ever bought! Patrick Park has an amazing talents in writing music and his tenor voice is perfect for the type of music that he performs. Trust me, you will love every track on this album!"
1,Do Not Be Tricked,"After reading all the reviews of this album, one would be lead to believe that upon the first few listens, this would be a great album. Please, do not be tricked. Monotonous song structures, repetitive lyrics, and an unexpected country twang prove this album to be a let down. It blows my mind that this is the first review that isn't giving the album ridiculous amounts of praise."
2,Outdated and gender biased,"This book was written in the early 90s, and perhaps clergy self care was a brand new idea, but it belabors the point too long that self care is needed. Then it seems to assume that men are the ministers, with questionnaires that assume they are married to women. Not without good points, but too outdated for my liking."
2,Cheap,These hubcaps have cheap plastic attachment lugs which break easily. Ask your hubcap vendor if they have 100% steel attachment lugs to avoid easy breakage and lost hubcaps.
3,RURAL MAIL BOX,"MY MODEL DOES NOT HAVE THE ADDRESS PLAQUE, BUTTHE MAIL BOX IS THE SAME. THE QUALITY IS OK. IT ISA STANDARD SIZE, AND I WISH IT WAS LARGER. THEONE I REPLACED WAS LARGER, BUT I DID NOT COMPARESIZES BEFORE ORDERING. THESE TEND TO LAST A FEW YEARS,BUT I THINK I'LL GO WITH RUBBER OR PLASTIC NEXT TIME."
2,Stickers peel off - no replacements available from manufacturer,"I like how this design clearly broadcasts our house number. Recently, the numbers started shriveling up and peeling off. I contacted the manufacturer and they do not sell replacement stickers for this unit. That said, be prepared to buy a whole new plaque in 2 years.Update: Haven't found anything more durable, so I'm still buying these. On my third one. The adhesive letters just don't stand up to the Texas sunshine."
3,Difficult to apply Reflective background & looks cheap,"I thought the reflective background was already applied to the plaque, but it's actually a decal you must apply yourself. It's difficult to position perfectly into the recessed area & very difficult to lift up to reposition or to remove air bubbles. I recommend using a credit card or driver's license to push out the bubbles as you go along. Even using that technique, I was left with several small bubbles which probably contributes to the peeling problem others have experienced. While it will serve its purpose of clearly displaying our house numbers, it isn't very attractive & I will be ordering a custom made replacement."
2,Doesn't hold up over time,"It looks great when new, but after a couple of years the reflective background and numbers peel up and eventually fall off. It would be nice if the manufacturer offered just the replacement background and numbers and not the whole item."
2,Plastic and vinyl don't hold up to strong sun,"I just happily removed this address plaque from the fence after installing a metal one from another brand. The plaque was put up a couple of years ago, and its plastic and vinyl components have not held up in strong Florida sun.When the plaque was new, it didn't look bad, although it is all plastic and cheaply made. The reflective background and the numbers were a pain to apply. Applications of 303 once a month kept the black plastic frame edges from fading too badly, but eventually the numbers started to flake off, and the background loosened up. I don't recommend this product."
1,"looks good at first, but stickers wear out quick","I bought this product and it looked great for the first year, but the stickers started to fade and peel off. I tried to locate replacement stickers for the product and could not. I contacted the maker and was told that I should go ahead and replace the whole product. RIP OFF!! They want me to spend $17 for a $1.00 worth of stickers, no thanks. If the company wanted to keep customers happy and not rip people off, they would offer the stickers without making buyers purchase the entire address plaque.I DO NOT recommend this to anyone unless you only plan to be in the house for a year."
4,A Real Page Turner,"Commander Ken Carodine (yes, this gent is a Naval Reserve Officer) has produced a wonderful, well paced, finely constructed military thriller. The plot is virtually flawless, every twist and turn is plausible. The characters are deftly developed, with each individual's past subtlely combined with the action. Ken's prose is crisp and descriptive, portraying the details without bogging down the reader's interest. I would not be surprised to find All The Tea the focus of a Hollywood studio in the near future."
4,Techno Adventure,I read the book based on the reviews; I was not disappointed. The book it fast-paced with interesting characters that seem like real people with real problems we all experience today. The plot was intelligent with several unexpected twists. The Navy backdrop was interesting and believable because of the author's great attention to detail and knowledge.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It made me think about our relationship with China and how it continues to evolve. For me a good book leaves me thinking - this one is a real winner.
3,somewhat dissappointed,"I had great expectations for this book. It was ok but didn't offer the ""How to"" I was hoping for."
2,More pictures please,I would liked to have seen more pictures in this book. There is not really a lot of ideas. I really feel like I wasted money on this book.
2,Basically Silly,"Well, if you like books about a middle-aged cop who leaves guys half his age moaning in agony after a karate session, leaves women half his age moaning in bed, and every time his superiors meet with him, they promote him... then you'll like this book. If that sounds a bit silly, then the actual plot is even sillier, so perhaps you should pass. If Rankin's Rebus is too screwed up to be believable, then Skinner is too perfect to be believable."
4,"A worthy start to a Scottish based crime series, but.....","This was my first Skinner book, and I enjoyed it. I have since read several more, and they have became progressively worse! Skinner becomes more irritating and arrogant as the series advances, but this one was good."
5,After all these years...,"It was a real pleasure to hear this album again after so many years. I was pretty much a novice engineer when I recorded this album in 1970. I remember being very nervous about working with such a famous person but he immediately put me at ease. He really was such a nice guy and a gentleman. I was greatly surprised to find that he had a very nice singing voice, something I did not always find in other actor/movie star types that I worked with. After listening again to this album after so many years I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out pretty danged good for a relatively new engineer."
5,If you think you've seen every film about the holocaust.....,"For years I've read every book and watched every film I could find on this subject, but I've never seen or read anything from the perspective of this particular film. It's outstanding! You will forget who you are and you will just ""jump"" headfirst into history!! This film mainly deals with videos, narratives, etc. of the rescue of the Jews from the camps following the end of WWII. You come away with a better understanding of how the survivors must have felt, and how difficult life was for them even after the war. You will never again think ""They survived; they were the lucky ones!"" SEE IT!!"
3,a fair look at the founding of israel,"ah yes, once more a holocaust movie, this one using the darkest moment of 20th century history to justify the establishment of the modern state of israel. i will not go into the politics here, but merely rate the movie as a piece of art, by which definition it was good."
2,So-so documentary,"A grave documentary of the struggles of European Jews liberated from Nazi encampment to survive the isolationist aftermath of World War II. While the Allied nations strengthened their immigration laws and the survivors' formerly occupied homelands still bore the taint of anti-Semitism, the Jews were forced to live as refugees until founding the nation of Israel three years after the end of the war. I prefer movies such as Schindler's List and Anne Frank to this."
3,extremely short even for Zorn,"I have over 100 Zorn cd's and this one surprised me at it's short length. only about 36 minutes or so. The only reason i bring it up is that certain groups are great at pricing their cd's accordingly as EP's but to pay full price for half a cd filled with music....maybe it's just me. Tzadik as usual made a great package this time using Salvador Dali tarot cards (which i own a set!) as the front cover pic which is very fitting. Zorn describes the way the music was constructed and its meaning towards magik and sorcery but I have certainly felt more moved by some of his other pieces. He writes that the drum piece at times makes it sound like an octopus is playing but this release is very quiet and muted. Not really any aggressive playing just a ""less is more"" approach this time around. If you like some of his quiter works I would certainly try this one out.I myself prefer his more daring and noisy compostions :)"
4,Sense Field - Living Outside,"I have been a Sense Field fan since the early Revelation days (and before that, the Reason To Believe days) and although the edges of their sound are a lot more polished and radio friendly now, they still have that wicked melody and song writing ability. You'll be humming along to these songs after the first listen. Definitely recommended, even for older fans!!"
3,Maybe I'm expecting too much...,"and don't get me wrong, this is a very good acoustic set from Los Lobos, but it has the feel of being culled from various recordings. There is no build up of memntum, and I don't think this was set up as a cohesive project. The outstanding moments are ""Two Janes"". ""Guantanamera"" and ""Maricella"". In fact at the conclusion of ""Maricella,"" it feels like the set is about to take off. Instead, additional songs sound like Los Lobos is idling on the runway.I can recall outstanding moments throughout the times I have seen them, and have found the Live at the Fillmore Set from this year less than satisfying. This set just seems to be a smattering of live acoustic traditional Mexican tunes, delivered competently, and a few notable numbers from their catalogue. Somehow, I'd expect more than competency from them...."
1,Canon A710is Accessory package,"Canon 250D 58mm Close-up Lens for A700, A710IS, G1, G2, G3, G5, G6 & EOS SLR CamerasI was quite pleased to order this pack. Imagine my disappointment when I received it and found I couldn't use it without an accessory adapter. This fitting is not available for shipmwnt to Canada, so I am left with a package that cost me more than $140.00 that is useless to me. I feel that the vendor should have noted the delivery address and highlighted this problem.I would really like to be able to use these accessories that I received."
2,No such thing,"There are only a few items in this package that I use on a daily basis. I use the tripod, the carrying case, and the mini tripod. Everything else in this bundle is useless. If you are looking for a good wide angle lens or a good telephoto lens for your Canon Digital camera you're out of luck. No such lens exists...that is unless someone out there can point me in the right direction (I've been looking for quite some time now)."
4,"Sounds great, looks so so","Anyone who has heard ""I Suffered for My art. . . "" knows that Marshall's acoustic shows at the Stone Poney were great. This DVD certainly maintains the sound quality, in fact, you feel even more like you are there. The visual however leaves a lot to be desired. Often Marshall's face seems washed out or over exposed. I really enjoyed this DVD, and I think anyone who gives it a chance will, but don't expect amazing visuals."
4,A WAKING DREAM,"Lead singer/bandleader LD Beghtol's dreamy Southern voice on this very pretty mini-album transports you off to a land of dark pleasures - both cerebral and orchestral. There's even a song about THE VIRGIN SUICIDES that's lovelier than the Air movie soundtrack. In addition to the guitars and strinsg Flare is known for, there's an emphasis on the baritone ukulele (Beghtol's ax of choice) as well as sublime vocal harmonies, subtle keyboards and hushed drumming. And the cover of Kid Montana's ""Anywhere (Like the Moon) should become a classic. All and all a treat for folks who like Low, Magnetic Fields, Will Oldham (though Flare is more complex and sophisticated) and just good songwriting and arranging in general. The production is complex but transparant - listen in headphone for maximum swirl."
2,Cheap?,"First off. When I initially got this item I was incredibly happy. Estatic even. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. The only problems I had at first were minor. The chain was too small for me to wear comfortably, and for added protection, I doubled the hoop thing that the necklace goes through. Other than that, I was happy.But after wearing it a couple days, I've noticed the back of the pendant has started to wrap/bubble. And it kind of creeps me out. I don't know why. I guess it seems kind of cheap. The main reason I wanted to buy it was to wear, but I don't want to wear it if it'll disintergrate on me, or have the bubbling become worse.Still. I would liked to have rated this higher. When I got it, I was so happy. It was beautiful. Much better than the picture. But, I guess it's still nice."
3,In All Honesty...,Don't go by the stars on this one. The machine that I purchased came to me used and defective. So I never had the chance to try this product... no fauylt of this product. I still have this item... maybe I'll find a machine one day that works and use this 'juice'.
1,High shipping charge,I bought these folders because they were reasonably priced-$23.88 for one hundred. At the time of purchase I chose standard shipping. I did not know the shipping charge until they were shipped. I was charged $49.96 for shipping. Obviously I would not have made this purchase if I had known the shipping charge. The folders were purchased for a non-profit and I am embarrassed to submit this expense.
5,beleivable story line,"This five volume set has a very believable story line.It is set in the very near future and the conflict between the USA and it's allies and China and it's allies has come to pass.Jeff Head has put together characters, story lines, facts, and figures and created a very plausible scenario for the future of the world scene.If anything, Jeff may be too optimistic about the actions, and reactions, of different countries throughout the world, but that takes nothing away from the story.If you are looking for a page turner, in a somewhat Clancey style, you could do no better than this set."
1,"Cheap ripoff, Clancy does better.","Away goes the Red Russian Bear, and here comes the Orange (Red+Yellow) Chinese Dragon! At the time America can least afford to make enemies, we have this jewel of a book. Or series of books. With all its spelling and grammar mistakes, it's surprising he got the funding to write FIVE crappy books. Dr. Fu Manchu, reincarnated into the body of President ""Jien Zenim"". Did you know that name is unpronounceable in Chinese? I wonder how the average, illiterate Chinese in this series pronounce this tongue-twisting (to their uneducated minds) name? Oh, that's right, they can just call him, mein Kameradführer!If you're part of this China-bashing hysteria, please, at least switch to Clancy, he does the same thing, but without the spelling errors and the horrendous cover."
5,A very real possiblity,I enjoyed this series very much. A frightningly real possible senario. Especially with the latest news on the rise of China. They see us as a road block to their supremacy is Asia and the rest of the world.
4,Very good story,I tore through this book and enjoyed it. I havn't read a book of this scope and magnitude since Red Storm Rising. Besides a few unrealistic I tore through this book and enjoyed it. I haven't read a book of this scope and magnitude since Red Storm Rising. Besides a few unrealistic turn of events like Americans armed to the teeth wouldn't start shooting each other over road rage and starbucks lines. I remember the 1980s paranoia over corporate Japan taking over the world but China is definitely a threat on a level to what's portrayed here in this book. They contributed huge sums of money to the previous Clinton presidential campaign and instruct countries like North Korea and Iran when to pop off. Now Russia is trying to return to the old ways by cozening up to the red banner of China. This story is completely possible but let's not forget it's categorized as fiction not prediction here.
4,OnGuard Lock,Not a bad lock. While a little pricey they are a lot better than the foreign non European made ones. Would definitely buy another one.
4,be aware!,"this disc lock does not fit on a sport bike front disc brake.... well i couldnt get it to fit proper, get the model one size down."
5,YUK IS THE GREATEST TODAY!,"if you a true yukmouth westcoast fan...you gotta get this album! every track on this album is tight...yuk puttin it down for the westcoast... and destroyin 50, em, and g-unit all tha way."
4,"Finally, he quit growling","Yes, Yuk's inception to the rap game showed talent. One could hear his lyrics and either crack up laughin or put a hand to the mouth on his unique delivery. When solo projects came, Yuk became a lot more agressive and his vocals became aesthetically displeasing. Finally, he came back to a smooth delivery, indicating much growth, and can truly express his talent to those eho do not enjoy being yelled or growled at when driving back from a hard days work."
3,"BEST TRACK 'BE EASY', WORST TRACK (50/EM DISS) 'THUG LORDZ'","1st of all, I repected Thug Lordz frum da beginin since dat P diss but now FAKE SH*T has been crackin wit da disses nowadayz against G-Unit/Shady especially callin Em u aint a gangsta cuz he neva said he was! I diss-unagree wit dem callin out names 4 nuttin! Jealous frum their wealth & thuggin! I got attention frum a nu diss towards G-Unit which is Thug Lordz (Yukmouth & C-Bo) f/ Bang Em Smurf, Domination called 'Need A Hug'. ALL THUGZ NEED LUV & DATS DA END!!!"
2,Got what I paid for...,The can opener... doesn't. It just turns and turns and hardly goes around the can at all. I had paid 19.99 for the set and it wasn't worth that.
2,typical sucky example of japanese cinema,"its a japanese version of the star-crossed lovers. but they are rival warring samurai clans. each side has magical fighting abilities. you can predict the whole thing from the first scene. some people might think some of the fight sequences are cool. a couple of them were a little cool. but it was bad, a poor film."
1,Dubbed in English!!!,"I don't see anything on the product page to indicate this, but... Before you rent/download this, be aware that it's dubbed in English."
1,Peackocks - Review,"I ended up returning this book because it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I expected a much larger book. This one was a thin and small as a childs book. I don't recommend it, especially for $25. It's not worth nearly that much $$."
3,need more information,"The book has lovely photographs in it,and answers some of my questions,but leaves a lot more unanswered.I really need a book onpeacocks that takes them from hatching,and probably until they are about 5 years old.I had 6 peachicks hatch out in late spring and I lost every one of them.I came to find out they should have had worm medicine.We don't have a Vet in town that deals with birds.However,I shall go back on Amazon and see if I can get a more informative book.Other than that ,I have had very good shopping experiances at Amazon."
4,Sense of Fear,"I enjoyed Devil's Footsteps for many reasons, but it lured me in mostly by the fear. This book built up a great sense of fear and abandonment within the reader. I felt as if I lived there in the moment, experiencing what they were seeing with their own eyes. This book receives five stars from me for its descriptiveness, cliffhangers, and portrayal of fear."
1,Low Heat/Low Air,"I am loyal to Conair blow-dryers, but after purchasing this one, I may have to switch. It's big, clumsy, and blows very little air at a what seems to be a very low speed. When I use this blow-dryer it takes twice as long to dry my hair now and the style turns out flat! My old blow dryer was also a Conair 1875 and was twice as hot and the power was twice as strong. The performance of this new Conair blow-dryer is unacceptable and I'm going to have to purchase another."
4,"Fast paced original plot, but add a glossary please!","Angus the Blood is on a mission to find a bride, but his hopes of finding his perfect lady-wife are hampered by Birdalane - a myopic, pagan healer -- whom he accidentally marries.Enjoy this book immensely. Fast paced, fun and hard to put down. But if the series continues (Ian next please), consider adding a glossary for the Scottish terms. There were too many to keep track of, and by the end of the book I was going ""wodey"". I never figured out what ""sheet"" meant (some kind of curse word), and it took a few pages before I figured out why the guy kept worrying about his ""sweeties""."
4,View of a bygone world,"I loved it. Ok, it seems that someone scraped together any fabric or fashion related promotional video they could find and piled them onto this DVD, and I'm glad they did. I'm going to screen the ""Simplicity"" one at my next American Sewing Guild meeting. Very inspiring and amusing -- how the world has changed! Some clips show how selling was done in the middle of the last century."
1,AWFUL!!!!,"The acting in this movie was just silly. The story line was all over the place, the plot was silly, the whole thing is just silly. If you can rent this for FREE, then you won't be angry you wasted your time watching this mess of a film."
3,"Nice yarn, ends in a whimper","Kate White takes the reader on a fun whirlwind tour of tabloid publishing, celebrity news and sleazy paperazzi, while her heroine goes about solving a murder. There is a bit of an implausible slapdash romance involved, and at times it feels the book will never end. The whodunnit questions keeps the reader turning the pages, but when the solution unfolds, it is rather disappointing. The character least developed in the whole book, someone who has commanded virtually no emotional attachment, conflict, passion, revulsion etc. turns out to be responsible for the murder, and all the colorful, engaging potential suspects deflate and disappear into thin air, leaving the reader rather disappointed and with a flat feeling."
3,Book two of Bailey Weggins,This is book two of the Bailey Weggins series. Bailey gets fired from her job as a freelance writer at a womens' magazine only to have to take a job at a celebrity gossip magazine. It doesn't take long for a body to drop at here feet. It was pretty good. Lea Thompson narrated it.
3,Great read - bad ending,"This book had me captured the entire way through. The ending however, was a let down. I too felt the story had ended rather quickly leaving more questions then answers. I hope in Kate's next book she will answer a few of them - mostly about Bailey's personal life, but also about the secrets that she unfolded through her job. Looking forward to the next book and hoping it doesn't end in the same way."
3,Didn't Care for the Ending,"I listened to the audio book and enjoyed Lea Thompson's reading style. The story held my interest fairly well until the end when it seemed to run out of steam like suddenly there was a time limit. I also thought Bailey was annoyingly stupid at times and it was like the author didn't know it because the mistakes didn't lead to any trouble in most all cases. For a crime writer, she blabbed too much info when she shouldn't have and her love interest wasn't described in a way that made me understand her attraction. It's a light read and pretty forgettable."
3,O.K. but not her best,"I have really enjoyed Kate White's books in the past, but this one just didn't measure up to the others. I found myself putting the book down and finding other things to do when I normally devour her books from start to finish. I still enjoy the main character (Bailey Weggins) and find the setting of Manhattan quite fun, but the story line just didn't hold my interest. The biggest complaint I have is that it seemed to repeat itself over and over. I would read 50 pages and feel like nothing had really happened other than the main character talked with some people. Another 50 pages, and she talked with some more people. Another 50 pages, and she talked with some more people. Not really up to Kate White's other work. If you would like to read it because you are a fan of the series, I would recommend checking it out from the library. Not really worth buying."
3,Well illustrated,"This is quite a pleasant, well-illustrated book about trees you might think of growing in your garden. As usual with this type of book, about half of it is just a directory of trees, giving info about zones, height, spread and the trees likes and dislikes.The first part of the book discusses trees that will do well in certain circumstances or for certain purposes - clay soil or winter display, for example. The book also explains planting, propagation, transplanting and gives ideas for hedges and avenues.You won't find much that is new or inspiring here but Sarah Cuttle's photography adds visual appeal to to a somewhat pedestrian text."
5,An excellent learning tool,"As a child, I studied music, but I wanted to brush up on my music theory. This video presents classical and jazz music theory in a very accessible way.Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite and Duke Ellington's arrangement of the same are used to illustrate different aspects of music. Marsalis uses visual aids that tie the music theory to everyday aspects of life.This is a great video for kids and adults to learn more about the music that they are appreciating."
4,A fascinating read....Woods does it again!,"For those of us who loved ""Hill Country"" and ""True Women"", Woods doesn't disappoint. Here is more of the story of her family, and the evolution of life in Texas. The characters, based on her ancestors, are real, and carry us through what was a very difficult time - a time of persecution of those who had the courage to risk life and limb to find a home in our promised land - and who, for the most part, were loyal, patriotic citizens. Again, we are aware of the resiliency and courage of those pioneer spirits who created the Texas of today. This is a great read, particulaly if you are interested in the human side of Texas history - warts and all."
3,Not a totally hands-free system,"This accessory is not a fully self-contained hands-free car unit. It is a two-piece bracket/cradle to attach and hold the phone on a flat surface; a separate cigar-lighter plug in charger; and an ear-phone/mic hands-free plug-in like the one that Samsung provides with the phone.I was expecting an all-in-one unit that plugged into the cigar lighter, and had plug-in remote mic and speaker, which would provide for hands-free conversation in the car while charging the battery.Having an earphone plugged into my ear and a wire dangling across the steering wheel is not my idea of a hands-free car adapter.The quality of the components of this accessory are good, but it is less functional than I expected."
2,"One man's collection of good poems, not mine","I found almost no poems in this book to like. Mr. Keillor and I are not on the same page when it comes to poetry. I do hope that Keillor, whom I happen to admire, has not made the mistake of thinking that the American poetry reading public lacks the ability to appreciate poems of real depth and substance. I wanted to like this book. I ordered it with every hope that it would be filled with poems to which I could relate with real enthusiasm.Alas, that just didn't turn out to be the case. I am sorry that I feel so negative about the book. I wish it were otherwise."
5,For Beginners and Connoisseurs,"*****I have always loved A Prairie Home Companion, and to discover that Garrison also has a ""poem-of-the-day"" makes my morning coffee taste better!This collection of poems is sundry, rich, and unadorned. It would have taken me a lifetime to have discovered all these poets, and now a whole new world of poetry is opened to me.I cannot recommend this book enough, especially for people who are just discovering poetry.*****"
3,Good anthology,Defintily these poems reflect a wide variety of styles and taste. There is something for everyone. Now if only it came with a CD of Garrison reading them.
1,Big disappointment,"The poetry selections were uneven and uninspired, even at times pedestrian. I could've thumbed through and found some good ones, but that was the main problem... I couldn't ""thumb through."" The uneven cutting and binding of this book -- done, I'm guessing, in the interest of pretense and affectation -- pretty much destroys this collection's functionality as an anthology. When you thumb, the pages flip by about 40 at a time... thump, thump, thump! This may be fancy and and fashionable in the artsy, fartsy Poetry Club circles, but it drives crusty old plodding poets like myself crazy! Stick with Billy Collins.Steve Jackson"
3,Alright,The product was fine once I received it. It took quite a while to receive the actual product though.
1,Ordinary poems,"These are simple and direct poems, they don't have much depth and they couldn't keep my interest for long. This collection doesn't even try to rise above the ordinary. These poems won't stir you, or make you think.I wouldn't recommend buying this book."
2,Who is the audience?,"I used this book as a text for a junior-level course. The first two chapters are well-written, with useful exercises, and appropriate for the audience; later chapters are far more difficult, with uneven coverage, and the exercises are far less useful (I had to use other books for exercises, hand out extensive notes, etc.) These later chapters might be good for professional review, but not for students.This is not just my perception; several students commented that the early part of the book was much better than the later part."
3,Wiper blade only lasted 3 months.,I installed a set of these wiper blades on my daughters car and they only lasted 3 months. The Arizona sun is hard on wiper blades but not that hard.Bob
4,A true classic!,"The music from FLESH + BLOOD is very enjoyable to listen to. If you liked the soundtrack from CONAN THE BARBARIAN than this is a CD for you! Although a bit pricey (limited edition!) this product is a good addition to a soundtrack collection. There are some who feel that the extra tracks do not add anything but I disagree; the extra tracks (e.g. ""St. Martin Leads the way"")are very welcome. Thumbs up!"
2,Wrong Merchandise,"If I had received the right shirt I could better write this review but instead of a kids medium red t-shirt with Robin on it, I received an adult medium blue t-shirt with all the Teen Titans. Luckily, my daughter didn't see the original so she was happy with what showed up but I am hesitant to order the one I wanted in case I get some other random shirt. I also emailed Old Glory through Amazon but never received any response from Old Glory about the mix up."
5,Truly complete,"This is the book that you never give away, even if you have not used it for a while. Just when I think I know what I need to know, I find a section in the book that educates me.I have a large library of new and vintage sewing books. I keep many books because each book seems to have a section that another book does not have or does not explain as well. 8 to 9 times out of 10, the Reader's digest book will have what I need while most other books have a hit rate of 50%.A must have that will support you for years to come."
4,very good condition,Book was received in very good condition and it was shipped right away. This book is exactly what I wanted.
3,Not ideal for beginners or even semi-beginners,"I recently decided to follow a lifelong ambition and take up dressmaking. I took needlework classes at school (admittedly about 15 years ago) and so I know how a sewing machine works, how to cut patterns etc, but there are a lot of gaps in my basic knowledge and this book is NOT managing to fill them. It uses a vocabulary that obviously makes sense to people who know about sewing, but many words aren't explained properly in layman's terms.It's a good book, I'm glad I bought it, and I'm sure it will be a useful reference guide when I have more experience, but at the moment I need something a bit more basic that really spells things out in words of one syllable - which is what I thought this book would do."
2,Compartments too little,"I was dissapointed with this one because the compartments were a little too small. I don't even use this item for myself. If the bowl was a little deeper, it would work fine; but I just keep it for the babies when they come over. They don't like their food to touch each other they don't eat much so this works out for them."
1,Defective!,"Like another reviewer said, the lids are too small for the plate. I just spent five minutes trying to force the lid to close, hoping that I could get some use out of them, to no avail. (I have another one that I purchased as part of the full set. That one is AWESOME, which was why I wanted two more.)"
1,Lids were too small for plate!!!,"I was really excited for these tupperware dishes to arrive and when they finally did, I realized that the lids were too small and you couldn't close the plates. Obviously, they were defected. Amazon was very helpful though and sent me a return address slip so I wouldn't have to pay for the actual return, but still, what a pain! I just wanted to use these plates."
4,"Sturdy, but lids hard to put on","These bowls are nice and sturdy, just like I expected them to be. They are just the right size for my daughter's lunch. The only issue is that the lids are somewhat hard to get on. Just takes a little practice, though. I definitely think we'll get more than our money's worth out of these."
1,Don't do this kit! Very bad combo.,"OK, I had this set up on my Miata and am going to pull it off - DONT buy these. Why? The lowering spring rate is too soft, So you end up running right on the rubber bump stops. That's real bad. Also, the Tokico blues are NOT good shocks for a miata, especially for a lowered miata. Check mnet there are horror stories about this set up."
1,Mmmm.. Poor.. and rather confusing..,Frankly speaking there are far better books that you can read to really understand India's history and the vedas....
3,A scholarly approach to make a unilateral case,"The author has done an excellent review of the Hindu culture and has missed the fundamental understanding between the Hindu Religion, Hindu Philosophy and Hindu Culture and at times looks confused between these since the goal was a unilateral pursual of ""mine is better than yours"" and missing the theme that every religon has its good and bad and that Christ only evolved thousands of years after Hinduism brought spiritual light to the world."
3,"Entertaining, but...","Chris Welch is a very good writer, and I enjoyed his little pamphlet (for that is really all this is) on Genesis. When I first read this, I had no clue about his history with Melody Maker and so forth, I was just trying to learn about the band. He writes descriptions and short critiques of every song and every album they did up until ""We Can't Dance"" and pretty much every solo effort to that point (mid-1990's). I would only truly recommend this book to someone who values Welch's opinion on this sort of thing. Hardcore Genesis fans like myself would find it rather hard to swallow that he thinks ""The Lamb"" is a complete and utter waste of time, and that ""Invisible Touch"" is the ultimate Genesis album. Still, if you're a Genesis neophyte, and wish to know a general description of the style and contents of each album, this helps. Probably just as informative to read amazon.com reviews of each album!"
1,THE Chris Welch?,"After spending many hours in the library during the late 70s and early 80s reading concert reviews and interviews with various members of Genesis in imported copies of Melody Maker - most of them penned by Chris Welch, I found this booklet to be disappointing in that it is far from complete and (based on other readings) sometimes inaccurate. It would be my hope that some day Chris would write a real book about Genesis, similar to his book about Yes, full of anecdotes about their touring days, insites into more of the songs - the stuff Gallo didn't have the space for."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This author, while rich with words, is lacking in tact. The book makes reviews of each album, and almost every song. He shares his terribly rude opinion he has about each song, as if he's some kind of musical prodigy. And while it may be commendable that he took the time and effort to publish the book, I see no point in buying someone elses opinions. They're free on the web."
3,Old fans can skip it..new fans might enjoy.,"If you're an old fan of Genesis you're familiar with Chris Welch, much less the Genesis catalog. The only interest might be some photos that are not so common, and even the author isn't sure where they originated from! Other wise, this is just a healthy introduction to the band and related releases."
1,Cheap and not much fun.,"I bought this toy for my daughter's 5th birthday and she was excited until we took her out of the box and followed the directions to get Sarah on her bike and ready to play. The doll does not sit on the bike seat. When her feet and hands are attached to the appropriate places(handlebars and pedals), her bottom just hangs in mid air and her head falls backwards, so she appears to be riding her bike as though she's fallen asleep. Her legs do appear to be pedaling(for a short while) and the bike moves only in forward and backward motions. She can't do wheelies on her own, you have to attach a clip from the bike to the cart and it allows the bike to ride with only the back wheel on the ground and the front wheel raised in the air. Also, her feet constantly fall off the pedals. The little hooks that attach to her feet are not big enough to fit into the holes on the bottoms of her feet, so after she pedals three or four rotations, they just come apart. This was a disappointing toy."
1,Her feet fall off the pedals,"My daughter had to have this, however....as Sarah goes around the house, her feet keep falling off the pedals. Quite annoying as it's too hard for her to put back on, me as well!!"
3,A little disappointed,"My daughter saw this toy on TV and ""just had to have it"". She received the toy for her birthday and once we got batteries and figured out how to get her on the pedals and handlebars, she worked. But, like the other reviews, she does not sit on the seat. This is a little disappointing. Even my daughter asks ""why doesn't she sit on the seat?"" It is very cute but disappointing at the same time."
4,New Food Combos for Stews,"I find myself pulling this book off the shelf again and again. My family really enjoys the Old-Fashioned Beef Stew with Coffee which is easy to make. The Curried Vegetables with Chick-Peas & Raisins is also good. This week I'm trying Shrimp Curry with Mango and Pineapple. If you're looking for some new ways to make one-pot or crockpot meals, this is the book. Can't say I'll ever make Venison Stew with Armagnac & Prunes, but you might have a call to do so."
5,Simply Stews,"This is the ultimate stew book to have. So far, every recipe I tried was wonderful. I particularly like the Coq au Vin and the Venison with Prunes. I also like how each dish has freezing guidelines. Interestingly, some of these dishes are even better after having been frozen."
1,This book sucks,"The authors neglect to follow the proper format in example problems, such as writing out the formulas first, or using units in solving the problems. This is a terrible habit to teach. It also makes it very hard to follow."
2,"Definitely a ""collector's shelf"" toy","Overhaul is a very nice-looking toy, both as a Humvee-esque vehicle and as a Wolverine-esque robot. Unfortunately that's about all he is. Overhaul is jointed in a way which, while excellent for putting him in dynamic-looking poses for a display, is all but useless when it comes to actual play. (He can't even achieve the ""stand perfectly straight with one arm pointed forward and the other down by his side"" pose popularized by the nearly immobile early Transformers toys.) His gimmick is weak, too: apply excessive force to his ""Cyber Key"" in an unsuccessful attempt to get it to stay in the little slot on his back so you don't lose it, and he fires a missile THROUGH HIS OWN CHEST.Overall, an unexpectedly weak toy among the veritable avalanche of awesome that is Transformers: Cybertron. If you have to have all the major show characters, I suggest you wait for Leobreaker."
3,Overhaul is cool,"Well, Overhaul is great and all, but I don't know where to start. Oh yeah! He is way better in green. They decorated the windshield and windows red. He looks like X-mas. I wonder what's inside?"
5,Soft touch cushion,"This cushion is great. I have a problem with sitting on anything the least bit hard or for any length of time, so I purchased this for my car. I have used this now for 2 years and am still very impressed with it. I guess, after 2 years, and still loving it - it speaks for itself. It has a nice soft top and a sturdy vinyl bottom which can be removed to be washed, which I have not had to do, at least not yet!"
5,Very enjoyable!,Excellent documentary about forgotten champions and a long gone era in sports. Really shines the light on how much the Olympics and sports have changed.I highly recommend this DVD if you are a hockey and/or Olympic fan!
4,Miracle Not forgotten,I truly enjoyed the DVD. It would have only been enhanced if it was done in circa 1981. I would have liked to hear Mr. Brooks viewpoints. I wish there was more footage on the game and color commentary on the plays. Hats off to the team that put together this documentary. I really liked the way this story was told as well as seeing and hearing from greats like John Mayasich.
3,These do not float in surf.,Great fins for body surfing but I already lost one.They might float in a calm pool but not in churning surf.Keep a good hold on them if you're putting them on with breaking waves around.
2,Not much bass,Maybe about what you would expect at this size and price point though. Hard to complain for the price. Get the bigger Infinity 8 inch sub for $40 if you have the space and cash.
3,Bigger is better,"This works, but not loud enough to hear. Need a bigger box. If you had the bigger box, you could use a bigger speaker.200 watts is enough for a sub, but I think the factor is box size more than anything. If I had room for a big box I wouldn't have bothered with this."
2,Visual Deception,I looked at the picture saw 400 watts looked at the watts and thought 200 was the rms. another sight i looked at said max rms of 200watts which reinforced my assumption. Also the box shows holes for eight screws the one i got had spots for 4 screws. The terminals on the box they came in were of a different style. And the picture shown on amazon is of a pw877x. Sound quality also is no good i have a 80 watt amp so it is getting enough power. These subs are inferior and i gave it 2 stars cause i liked the weight of the magnut.
3,I thought its a lot better,"I got this subwoofer yesterday,there wasn't any damage to the package,the sub looks brand new.I connected it to my amp,I put in a speaker cabinet with a big port and it really didn't impress me,I can't turn the subwoofer more than 10% volume without that the subwoofer sounds like its going to blow...my amp is from the labtec pulse 485 (I think it gives 12 watts) Its just for music and movies on my pc..so is it my amp or its the subwoofer thats bad?if its the amp than please tell me what amp to buy,thank you."
3,speaker is ok,"i have bought this speaker to replace the logitech x530 because i wanted more thump more bass more boom, but didn't fit because the sub hole is 5.25 inch big but bass did sound good but the rim wasn't glued on right and had to send it back, not because of the glue because of the size."
5,Not a single poorly sung song,"You gotta hand it to Doris Day. Although she sang an occasional poorly written turkey of a song , she sang every song well , and without a single off pitch note. A true , pure voice. Bear Family has released every note Doris ever uttered in pristine sound----along with the other three boxes you will have a gift from an angel."
3,Finding the good in the bad...,This book was intriguing for the mind of a simpleton of myself. I like the Sopranos and have nothing to offer religion but the comparisions in this book to the characters of the Sopranos and religious matriarchs of the bible kept me reading on. The Gospel... was a book for me that gave insight of religion of today and the entertainment world. Finding the good in the bad was what came out of reading it. Anyone who feels that the Sopranos is not a show worthy of their eyes because of violence and language they need to read this book and look beyond all that.
2,Interesting angle,I thought it had an interesting angle to the mob family. But the writing was terrible. Very high school. I was disappointed that the issues were glossed over.
3,"What A World, What A World","This is a good book that could have been a great book.When David Chase created ""The Sopranos"" he intended to provide a lens by which we could examine our daily habits, values and aspirations. [Source: his interviews on the Season 1 DVD.]Sort of like a mobbed-up Simpsons, I guess.Chris Seay took the bait and used parts of the series' plot and characterizations to create a good philosophical primer for aficionados of the series. Some select observations:A.J. may be the most spiritually mature character in the series.Dr. Melfi ignores reality [Tony's evil nature] and places false blame while offering an escape from the truth.Betrayal can only happen if yuou love.Never say you hate life - that's blasphemy.There could have been much more here...but, collecting these things in the way in which he does, Chris Seay adds to our awareness."
2,Don't buy it on the Kindle!,"I've seen this book at the library and wanted a copy for myself. When I saw the Kindle version, I decided to purchase it. I regret doing so. No where in the description for the Kindle edition did it say that all of the photos were in black and white. Since I've seen the actual book, I know that the pictures were in color and good quality. All of the pictures in the Kindle version are black and white and have poor contrast. If you count on having good pictures to do needlework, don't buy the Kindle version of this book - buy the print version."
2,Kindle version is seriously substandard,"The Kindle version this book is seriously substandard compared with the print version. Yes, the Kindle version is in black and white, but what appalls me is how badly the photographs turned out. They are extremely dark and in some cases you can't even see what the image is beyond the black blob on the screen. The print version is terrific! Thank goodness I own a print version. I was excited about having a version on my Kindle for when I travel, but I have serious reservations about recommending the Kindle version. If there's going to be a Kindle version, do it in color!"
5,Wonderful Book,"This book is a great way to learn how to make buttons for just about any project that you would like to make, especially historical clothing."
5,Excellent Trafalgar History,Roy Adkins has done an outstanding job of portraying the Battle of Trafalgar in all its fearsome detail. This book is an easy read as Adkins narrative flows easily around the events bringing the whole event to life. This is a comprehensive history of one of the battles that resulted in English being the most spoken language on the planet as the British Empire was built on sea power. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of Nelson and Trafalgar.
1,Another Rip-Off Set of Re-Recordings ---- Avoid Like the Plague.,Another Rip-Off Set of Re-Recordings ---- Avoid Like the Plague. REAL OLDIES MUSIC lovers want the ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. Period.
1,Waste of time,"More about the music industry than Amy. And yes, the narrator's voice was atrocious. Very glad I did not pay to watch."
4,I always liked the show,"This is one of my all time favorite TV shows. It is on one channel that started charging to be seen.The other shows I have either seen, or don't care to watch. It was on one night, and I wanted to watch it.One channel at $5.00 per month to occasionally see Macgyver is riduclious!I went to my computer to see if Amazon had any DVD's avalible, I'm writing this so that is the answer.Anyone that has jury-rigged a car to get home knows the Macgyver feeling.Side-note to fans that want to know, His first name is Angus."
4,Decent wide angle lens for the price,"seems to work ok, and the macro lens is nice too. I didn't actually realize that there were 2 separate lenses (first the macro, then the wide angle). I am using them on my konica Z6, and it does capture a wider angle, which is helpful for family shots and landscapes.The threads on the lenses don't always catch, and it kind of makes this disconcerting screaching noise as you are screwing them together, but maybe that's how all lenses are (this is my first add-on lens).for $29 it seemed worth a shot. Now I am considering getting the telephoto lens."
2,I need originality to be inspired,"I think it's great that this woman stands so strongly behind her convictions and she is clearly a very talented poet. I just wonder why talented artists who clearly have an abundance of creativity cannot find their own voices and instead insist upon copying Ani Difranco's style. This makes the album painful for me to listen to. Clearly, Alix is an amazing poet. However, hearing her recite them is like listening to someone trying to mimick Ani Difranco. She is great at sounding like her. I honestly could not tell the difference. Sorry, but I think thats kind of lame. I can't listen to Alix. I think she is extremely talented...yet this whole business of stealing Ani's style... I can't stand it. It happens to often and it is just..kind of lame. What happened to originality? If I want Ani, I'll listen to her. Otherwise I'd just like to read Alix's poems."
2,thr originality of passion,"I give her credit where it needs to be, but honestly folks, if I didn't know any better I would say that Ani Difranco had a new album. Alix uses the same patterns, phrasing, and vocal techniques as Ani- and to such a large extent that it sounds just like her!! When playing the album, I've had others ask me when did Ani release this new record. Originality Alix, please."
5,Best Watch Ever! (For a Golfer.),"About a year ago, I bought a book on the golf swing's tempo (""Tour Tempo""). Great book, but the practice of creating a tour tempo was difficult. Well, this watch is the key to that! It has several features, but ""practice"" mode is the one I find most valuable. In it, you can get feedback on every swing. (The watch can even tell the difference between a practice swing and a stroke that hits a ball.) In practice mode, you get the time of your backswing and downswing, total swing time, the ratio of back/downswing, the length (in degrees) of your backswing, and clubhead speed (if you set it with the club you're using.) NO training device I've ever had provides so much valuable feedback. Get one! (And buy ""Tour Tempo"" while you're at it.)"
1,Leaks like crazy,"After initial assembly, there was a small leak on the back. I wanted to wall mount the unit, but the leak prevented that. I worked with an ESU (the manufacturer) support engineer to resolve the problem. I cracked a part following his instructions, which made the leak worse. The engineer sent me a replacement part that did not fit. At this point, I gave up on asking the manufacturer for help.Finding a replacement part that fit was a major hassle as the instructions don't include any sort of part list. Finally I located the part and replaced it. No sooner was that leak fixed than the increased pressure (from no longer leaking) caused another part of the unit to leak. By now the filter is out of warranty and I have to set it up on top of the washing machine so water doesn't go everywhere. Every time I use it, I'm tempted to throw it in the trash."
5,SO GREAT,"I loved using this mold. The VHS was actual size in length only half the depth though, but it came out so great. I added a label to the front of it and hand painted it and it was sooooooooo cute!"
2,*yawn*,"If you loved ""Reality Bites"" or ""Garden State"" then you'll automatically love this one. But if you didn't happen to love those movies, then you'll likely not love this one. It reminded me a bit of the sitcom ""Friends"" only not as funny or as interesting. It just didn't have anything that will make it memorable to me years from now. Perhaps I'm missing the message because I'm not from this generation?"
2,Happythankyoumoreplease,"A DVD for the younger generation, 20-30's. Good comedy but could use some more. Might be more for those who live in the city."
2,Not my cup of tea,Was not interested in this film at all. I watched the whole thing and kept hoping it would end soon or that something would happen that would make me enjoy it. The story line was weak and the characters got on my nerves. I did find the acting was done well.
3,Above-average drama on life & relationships,"This film presents a solid ensemble of actors (including the film debut of a child actor) exploring their roles in life and how they perceive themselves and their peers. With multiple interconnected sub-plots occuring in the film some of the characters don't get developed too fully, though overall this film is driven by characters, their thoughts and feelings about themselves and others. This film is satisfying, though not exceptionally memorable. The ending felt like it could have been expanded some, while it seems like it offers a pleasing bit of closure for viewers. The film's title comes from a sort of self-help spiritual mantra of saying to the Creator/Universe ""thank you, more please"" in developing a positive, grateful attitude. That's something we can all take from this film - becoming more grateful. This film may not make your list of all-time favorites but I'd recommend it for a satisfying drama about life and self-discovery."
3,"Generally good, but not all that memorable","This was one of those movies that was good enough to generally hold my attention, but not so good that I'd ever want to watch it again, or listen to the commentary on the DVD. Nothing really stood out for me, either good or bad, although there were some significant implausibilities in the story line (including one of my pet peeves - skirting the issue of the economics of living in NYC).I would say it is a somewhat promising start for Josh Radnor (the writer/director). Hopefully, he can continue to hone his skills on his next film."
2,Boring.,"I just couldn't get into this movie. It was slow moving and did not have any witty banter which usually characterizes this genre of movie. I couldn't make it all the way through, and I have sat through some bad movies! As you can tell from the title, it seemed very stream of thought, from the mind of someone who is very boring, and not in the ironic sort of way."
3,Pretty good directorial debut.,"This is actor Josh Radnor's directorial debut, he also has role in the film as well.This is a good but not great dramedy IMO.One of my favorite character actors appears briefly, Richard Jenkins.All in all, I give it a solid three stars."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"I first watched this movie when I turned the television on. It was on the channel my television turned on to, and I thought I will see if this movie is any good. Well I finished watching and went the next day to get it. I loved it!! Hands down, makes my favorite movies list."
3,"Decent movie, implausible plot","This movie, when you cut beyond the veneer, is about a bunch of twentysomethings trying to find their way (see Singles, St. Elmo's Fire, etc.). The movie opens with Sam (main character) stumbling onto a little boy on a train. Suffice to say that the slacker Sam doesn't do a very good job getting the boy to the authorities, and instead lets him hang around for the better part of a week (totally implausible!) There are a few moments like that sprinkled throughout the movie (things that are hard to imagine, things that are too tied up too neatly in a bow). As a result, it is worth the watch, but missing anything particularly amazing - adequate plot, adequate acting, etc. Worth the first watch but hard to justify a repeat."
5,Just amazing,"This movie really made me think about my life and how i wanted to live. Powerful meaning to this movie, it really hits you"
3,Gift for father in law has held up fairly well,"This thermometer survived several winters and it's been outside. The face got a little blurred over time, but it still seems accurate."
1,Inaccurate,Bought this and returned it because it was inaccurate by 10 degrees F. The replacement was just as bad but Not bothering to return the replacement just keeping it for aesthetic value.
5,Perfect Pocket Shop Companio,I have had my PEC 6' square for a couple of months now and I am hooked on having it in my pocket or apron while working in my shop. It is a great size to carry at all times instead of my normal habit of setting my larger squares down and then trying to remember where I placed them. The construction was solid and the tightening mechanism works well. I read the Amazon reviews for all of the squares before I purchased this model along with woodworking magazine reviews. I am very happy with the price/quality I received on this model.
3,"1-3 Stars,Mixed Bag/Mixed feelings about it.Everything Must Go.","The Movie is what the flim makers intended it to be:Depressing,at times Dull and a mixed bag;I have mixed feelings about the film myself.I am a Ferrell Fan despite his politics and despite the Drab Movie and the politics implied and involved in ""The Other Guys""which was another Mixed bag with few highlights.The problem for me it is so slow paced and while There is light-hearted moments I would not bother to see the movie again,One time instantly on netflix is enough.Point Blank the movie is about selling everything he had because his you know what Wife soon to be ex is a you know what,granted he may have done some awful things but she was not classy;a Wife you never see by the way.And pay attention to the so-called ""Coach"" and ""Friend"" of Ferrell's in the movie,A movie that is perfect to hate."
1,waste of time,"This movie was okay. In a world full of excellent movies, when you watch the true cinema gems you can't help but feel with THIS movie there is little substance & you just wasted 2 hours of your life! keeping this review short to not waste more of it- 1 star."
1,This Movie Must Go,"Another nothing new nor creative portrayal of a white middle class, lost in the corporate climb, male with a slight affinity for a few beers. He gets fired and messes up even knifing his boss's tires and of course ends up losing his wife on the same day. He comes home to see his stuff on the front lawn and the door locks changed and bank accounts frozen by his now ex-wife who of course is seeing his trusted friend (on the sly).Formula, redundant, copycat storytelling where the ending was as predictable as taxes.Same predictable scenes of, of course, a lawn sprinkler coming on to soak the stuff on the lawn; attractive female with her own issues across the street; weird neighbors; and the predictable kid coming by to act as antagonistic foil to our protagonist who is sitting on the lawn with his stuff and acting helpless.Acting was very audition, read the lines, bland with the exception of CJ Wallace who gave the best performance of all by saying the least."
1,pitiful,i didnt think ferrell was capable of putting out such a poorly made movie---looks like a weekend project effort----------PITIFUL----NUFF SAID
3,movie is just okay.,i LOVE Will Ferrel but this movie was just okay....not as great as his prior movies. I would recommend renting it...not buying it first.
4,Excellent inspirational tale of an almost broken man.,"Lemme just say WOW. This film is easy come, sweet go. Will Ferrel plays a man who's having the worst luck in the world. He's losing everything in life and has picked up drinking and is slowly on his way to becoming a bum. The characters are very intricately pitched and there is irony but not in a typical movie telling way, the direction is awesome, you will see some familiar film characters who you've seen in other films. This is just an awesome feel good film, in the sort of sense ""Its a wonderful life"" was and it makes you reflect on the difficulties you may be facing in your own life and how good it feels to know there is no greater than the gift of being alive and the ability to transform, reform yourself to grow and get back on your two feet. There were a couple of very moving scenes, this is not a comedy so those of you expecting a Stranger than fiction won't find it here."
2,The ending needs work...,"I managed to watch the entire movie from beginning to end. I was waiting for a dramatic ending. It just didn't happen. It was not really, really bad. It was just bad."
4,A few really bad days,"It's so refreshing to see Will Ferrell play a human role rather than a mugging idiot - and he does it very, very well in this understated film about a few really bad days in a superficially successful man's life.I can't stand Ferrell's usual schtick, but this was good. From what I had read about Ferrell I was pretty sure he had it in him and I'm glad he takes a break from raking in the dough to make something good occasionally. I hope to see more."
3,Moderate aspiration moderate acheivement,"Doesn't try for a whole lot, and I guess succeeds. It is not dreadful, not at all; I cared and bought in. But too little content and too little humor made for an infield single. You can see where the story probably accomplished a lot more. You can see that an intellect was behind the production; that intellect just didn't contribute quite enough.I cannot imagine giving this 5 stars. Really folks--this was pretty slight. But the hate? There's not enough here to hate; it's like hating the 2003 Honda Civic. It is a slight, but tasteful, presentation of a selfish and self-indulgent man (married to an equally selfish and self-indulgent woman) who has started to slide off the edge and manages to recover. Maybe it's too late for his current life, but he can build a new one.But thank goodness there was no schmaltzy ending! Hooray for avoiding the pat solution!"
4,I can relate. I go to a lot of yard sales.,"I think a lot of people can relate to this middle class man. Divorce, lost his house, jobless, nice guy, had it all. Very funny."
1,Painful,This movie is the worst I have seen in a long time. It is painfully slow and boring. Don't waste your time.
2,Depressing with too little upside,"I had somewhat high hopes for this movie. I didn't expect it to be a comedy - or even somewhat funny. I expected it though, to be quirkier and with more upside than down. Unfortunately, it was just too depressing. The best part of the movie was the character ""Kenny"" played by a young African American actor. Loved him and loved his character. Will Ferrell gave a solid, understated performance, but the material was just way too depressing."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"There was little to no plot and no resoultion at the end. If you want to watch a film about nothing with no comedy, no suspense, and nothing to make it worth watching, this is the film for you. My guess is that this was a direct-to-DVD movie, which would explain why I hadn't heard of it before finding it on amazon. That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back."
2,this movie was clown shoes,"if i had to describe this movie with one word id have to say depressing. depressing as f@(%. i saw a movie with will smith that made me feel similar. i want to slit my wrists and jump out of a window from a forty story building and land in a pit of molten lava. in short this is the best will ferrel movie i have ever seen. almost as good as anchor man. no im kidding it really really sucked horribly and i seriously want to die now. i mean what the hell! this movie had the most god awful ending. my friends are being dic5s right now about punctuation and grammer and all i want to do is take a bullet to my head from having paid for this movie. i was waiting for like will ferrel to flip out and kill someone or like start beating the kid but no...nothing, nothing at all that was interesting. if you are suicidal...do not rent this movie...buy it! watch it over and over agin till you end your sad life."
1,Dismal with NO Redeeming Qualities,"I was expecting a light, humerous movie. Instead, an hour and a half of someone's alcoholism causing his life to rip apart at the seams."
2,Shallow attepmt at drama,"I did not expect this movie to be a comedy. I saw a preview for it and knew I would rent it. I like most of Will Ferrell's movies, and I thought Stranger Than Fiction was great. But this movie is really contrived. Not showing his wife as a character? Ironic, not creative. The depressing friend Kenny? Been done way too many times. Wife cheating on husband with friend? Been done to death! It's easy to depress people and have trendy ironic plot gimmicks, but it takes a little more to entertain. I watched it with my girlfriend and we both decided that we want our 2 hours back. If you don't like dramas, do not watch this movie. All that being said, Will Ferrell did prove he does have acting chops. He just needs better scripts."
2,"Do you appreciate yourself? If not, watch this.","Long, boring, slow, depressing to the tenth degree, and a very realistic story. Yes, there is a moral or two, hidden or lost in delivery. In short, if you are looking for a good time, or are even bored, keep looking 'cause this is not even a good time waster while sitting snowed in at the airport, or 8-hour train layover at the Chicago train station. If you are the artsy-fartsy type, or want to experience 'realism' in cinema and don't like yourself much, then have fun with this movie."
2,Very Depressing,"Not what you expect from Will Ferrell. Unrealistic view of a serious, depressing life situation. Not and entertaining or informative movie. Skip it."
4,great movie,"this is not the usual Will Ferrell movie, there are no laughs here but I think this is his best or at least in the top 3 movies ,It kept me interested the whole movie! I could of watched more if there was more to watch!"
2,Had a better time watching paint dry.,Not what I expected. Rarely funny. Dull. Love Will Ferrel. Disappointing. Not a movie I would suggest to anyone. Even my quirky friends.
1,Waste of time,"Very slow, not funny, and a total waste of time! I would not recommend this movie to anyone! Not Will Ferrell's best work."
1,Absolutely Painful,"I love Will Ferrell movies...except for this one. I kept waiting for some sort or even a hint of action or life in this movie. It never happened. I was looking for something upbeat and something that had his usual charm. Instead I watched in hopes there would be something funny, something light hearted, but I was left emotionally drained instead. Horrible, pathetic, and very lame movie."
1,Really Bad Movie,"There seemed to be some artsy meaning to the movie we just didn't get. We rented it because Will Ferrell is a comic genius. However, this movie was really poorly produced and provide little to no laughs. Save yourself the money."
4,Realistic portrayal of alcoholism/addiction.,I work in the field of addictions and found this to be an honest look at a man faced with the impact his drinking has had on his life. I especially liked the ending because it did not wrap everything up in a nice package and make the viewer feel everything was going to be great for Ferrell's character moving forward. I found the movie to be an interesting snapshot of a man at a crossroads in his life. Highly recommend.
4,Everything Is Good,"Great film! Really enjoyed it. Will Ferrell is an interesting comedian, because you're used to laughing at everything he says but it's great to see him in a film where he can be serious, Stranger Than Fiction is another great example of this. Great flick!"
4,Everything Must Go,"Will Ferrell's best drama since Stranger than Fiction. Or you could call it an indie comedy, but don't hold your breath for laughs. It is a great film."
3,3 1/2 stars for a more serious Will Ferrell,"Will Ferrell plays against type as Nick Halsey an alcoholic sales manager who is fired from his job. When he arrives home he discovers that his wife has left him, moved all his personal items out on the lawn and changed the locks on the doors. Only the fact that Nick is constantly drinking a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon, can I believe that anyone else in this situation wouldn't have gone around the back and broken into the house. So what if the cops come, it's his house. That aside, Ferrell gives his best performance since ""Anchorman"" and proves he can be a dramatic actor with deadpan humor ala Bill Murray. Nick decides to conduct a garage sale and is assisted by newcomer C. J. Wallace, a teenager with time on his hands. Rebecca Hall is excellent, as a sympathetic neighbor. The film isn't without humor but the focus is on Nick and his situation."
2,Nothing really happened.,There was no real conclusion. The movie was slow and dry. I dont recommend it. I want at least half of my money back.
2,"Sad movie, good acting","This is a depressing movie. Will did an incredible job acting and the story itself was somewhat original. However, this is far from a funny movie or a satire. This movie is just plain sad, so it should be in the drama category. So, if you like watching people at their rock bottom in life then you would enjoy this film, if you are like me and do not then skip it."
2,Not Funny -- Not Interesting,We watched this with semi-high hopes since it stars Will Ferrell. It was boring. All the characters were less than enthusiastic. Don't waste your time on this one. Go and watch Elf again. That was a good story and it is funny.
2,Can anyone explain the ending to me?,"It just...ENDED. Like abruptly. Did he get his wife back? What about that chick from high school? I cannot be bothered to rewind this movie and devote another minute of my life to it. What a bizarre ending. I don't get it. Then again I wasn't fully paying attention, as my mind had wandered off long ago."
4,A Lovely Story,"I didn't know what to expect from this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. Good writing, an interesting plot, and a story that seemed to move at just the right pace. Good character development and interesting dialogue.The story takes place in WWII, but the situations could still happen even today. It's a story of an earlier generation, but still applies to modern day.This isn't a book that takes a long time to read - it would be a great beach read - but it remains interesting all the way through. Give it a try, I think you will like it."
5,Great Toy,"I bought this toy for my son when he was about 18 months old. He is now 2 1/2 and he still loves it. Leap Frog toys are the best! The only problem I have with most toys is if they have a volume control, it's right on the front where my son notices it. Whenever I turn it down, he turns it right back up. :) The only solution I have ever found for that is to put a piece of clear packing tape over the speaker. It works wonders! Anyway, this toy is well worth the price."
4,Great to keep in the car!,My son got this a year ago for his 1st birthday and he loved it. We kept it in the car mostly and it kept him entertained for the drive. It was a great gift!
5,LEAP FROG TOYS ROCK!,Just got this for my daughter ( 14 months ). She LOVES to sing and dance so I thought this might be her kinda thing. She loves it. It is a great toy.Perfect size and the songs are actually nice to listen to ( unlike too many other toys ). It has alot of learning to get her going and it's just so fricken cute! Keeps her entertained hence keeps me ( mommy ) happy! Leap Frog toys are just so great! Love them!!!
2,"Not the best in the Leapfrog lineup, but it is ok","My daughter HATED this toy when she first got it. Actually, she was afraid of the voice, and refused to use it (she was almost 2 years old). As she got older, she would turn it on, but really didn't enjoy playing with it. The toy is kind of boring: turn the page, press a button, hear a song (and the same song as many of the other Leap products ""B says BEE, every letter makes a sound"" etc). Not much else. She prefers the Leapfrog refrigerator magnets better for learning the alphabet. For the price, I thought this was a sure hit. I'm glad I didn't spend more on it."
4,Pricy but cool toy!,"We got this when my son was about one, and it was great for entertaining him in the car. He is now almost three and can play the find the letters game and loves when it ""claps"" for a correct answer. I was going to get one as a gift for a friend, but it is more expensive than I remembered...."
3,Not enough volume control,"My two boys love this toy, but I have to put it away after a while because it's so LOUD. The on/off switch lets you choose a volume setting, but it's still very loud and easy for kids to change!"
2,Doesn't hold attention,My twins got this when they were 18 months and loved it the first day then got bored. They are 2 now and still won't sit and play with it. I'll try it again in a few months to see if it will hold their attention and help with their ABC's.
4,A Big Hit!,"My 18 month old son is obsessed with ""Buttons! Buttons! Buttons!"" and has just become really interested in music and dancing around. This toy met both of these urgent 18-month old needs. He just loves it! He already really loves books, so it's a bonus that that the front of the radio has pages that turn like a book with all of the different letters. We have only had it about half a week, but he is still fascinated with it and plays with it for long periods every day. He is very active so anything that can hold his attention for any period of time is a godsend. We love Leapfrog toys in general and already have the Alphabet Ball, Learning Drum and Phonics Bus. I think these toys are in large part responsible for helping him with starting to learn the Alphabet song. He knows a few letters and hums the tune when he wants us to sing it and there is a lot of ""a, b, d, b"" type singing from him. It's very cute! Thanks Leapfrog!"
5,Leap frog is the way to go,My 1 year old loves this. Each alphabet has a beat to it that she likes and dances to. If you like a learning material leap frog is the way to go.
3,Somewhat happy mom,"This toy is ok. It gets boring fast. My daughter likes to turn the pages and she likes some of the different sounds. But the game that comes on when you push the middle button and the whole explantion after you push the button for each letter is annoying. It asks your child to say the letter but it goes to the next thing way too fast. I ended up selling this thing in a garage sale and the best offer I could get was $3. Not very impressive, in my opinion."
2,Not a good value for the price,"This toy is not a good value. My toddler received it for Christmas and has only played with it twice 10 months later. There is VERY little interaction needed for the child to do things, the toy mostly just talks at you."
3,Good Start but Didn't Last,I bought the phonics radio to keep my daughter entertained on a plane trip. It was great for the trip but we have only had it for a few months and the audio has started repeating and not changing when the pages are turned which makes it so the radio says R when the button is pushed for L.
1,Whitney's Worst,"I found this to be the worst novel I've read by Whitney. The plot was sluggish, the characters stiff and the resolution felt unresolved. I do not recommend this one at all."
2,This book is very unusual for a mystery/romance novel,I believe this book is out of character with its genre. The nature of and the answer to the mystery is most shocking and unexpected. I would not recommend it to readers who are sensitive and easily offended by certain matters.
3,"No bad, dont fit a std pickup","These look pretty sturdy for the price for sure. I have a Ford F150 pickup and these are way too big to go in the stake holes. I'm talking like 3/8"" too big. If they wont fit an F150 what will they fit? I have a band saw so I cut a lot of rubber off and made them fit. I expect the steel screw part will rust immediately.. so once they are in it may be hard to ge them loose. Still for the price....they're ok if you have a bandsaw... The plate appears to be stainless steel, theloop chrome and the threaded ""bolt"" zinc coated steel. Probably a bad combo for the long term. would be nice if the bolt was SS also."
1,Must every scene be out of focus???,"I guess there was a plot, eventually, but between the shaky camera and the out of focus shots, who cares.Look Mom, I'm directing.Oh, get over yourself. You ruined what might have been a good story with your edgy and childish affects.A few seconds, fine, but keep it up minute after minute, you're a jerk.I rejected this disc after about 10 minutes because the director was so upstaging the acting with the out of focus shots over and over and everything being so blurred and freaky, like maybe you need a new camera?. Ugh."
3,It takes time but.....,"At first I didn't like this film. It was too artsy, too frumpy, too fuzzy. Far too fuzzy. Frankly I bought it because I am a big PJ Harvey fan, no surprises there right? But after watching it a few times I begain to find importent and often funny moments. The interaction between Jesus and the Devil are often quite amusing.The acting is lacking. Donovan has done better work in my opinion(Nadja, for example). PJ Harvey is surprisingly good, speaking as a critic and not a fan, perhaps the best actor in the film really besides maybe Thomas Jay Ryan. As for her looking like ""Jack Skellington"", as my friend pointed out, well she has always looked that way.If you like independent films or are an art student then this is a good choice for you."
4,The Book Of Life - funny and thought-provoking,"It is the rare indie film that a)is funny in a droll way b)is thought provoking c)is especially interesting for biblical scholars d)that is both directed by Hal Hartley and is short and e)manages to squeeze in a Yo La Tengo cameo. Such, however, is Book Of Life, a film that posits a kinder, gentler, Armaggedon. Jesus Christ arrives at the airport December 31, 1999. He's expected to open the 4th-7th seals on the Book of Life, thereby unleashing Armageddon. He begins to have second thoughts, however, as he looks around and examines humanity. This causes trouble with God's lawyers. Besides the uniformly excellent writing, this movie also recalls Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, in that both movies hold special delights for those well-acquainted with the source material. The movie, shot on a digital camera, doesn't suffer for it. For Hartley fans, well worth the investment."
5,beyond belief,"Living in England, I doubted I would ever get to see this short, let along actually own it. This is a multiregional release, so us Limeys can purchase the DVD as well as you darned Yankees. The film itself is only an hour or so, but succeeds on every level - there's not an ounce of fat on it. A freewheeling take on millenial apocalypse, it stars Hartley veteran (and all round object of desire) as, appropiately, God versus Thomas Jay Ryan's delicious Satan. A superb supporting cast including PJ Harvey (a revelation) and Hartley's better half Miho Nikado help bolster this humorous and theologically inventive piece into the realms of pure cinematic joy. Thomas Jay Ryan's Satanic deliveries to camera are superb. His best film? Quite possibly. Go on, shoot me. Reccomended without hesitation to all."
2,"Fascinating concept, curious execution","I love the quirkiness and daring of Hal Hartley but I must admit that I do not intend to keep this one in my collection.Having said that, a negative review would not have stopped mefrom seeing this film. I enjoy the difference that Hartleybrings to film. I watch the short ""Surving Desire"" regularlyand I also love ""Simple Men"", ""Trust"" and ""Henry Fool"".Basically, I wasn't convinced of the necessity of thecamera contortions and I didn't follow what he ws trying to saythrough his charachters. Hartley's technique walks a fine linein his films and sometimes a viewer simply says ""Oh, please!""Didactically, I don't think you can learn anything in ""Bookof Life"" that hasn't been said in his other films.Of course, if you're a Hartley fan like me, you'll see this regardless. You won't let a sourpuss detur you from your curiousity.Either you'll feel slighlty burned like me, or you'll love it and change your life. I wish you the best."
3,GENERAL INFO,IMO book contains a lot of very general info probably already known by most gardeners. No real revelations found .
1,Louisiana Gardener's Guide,"The book is very limited. It doe not include very many plants or a guide on how to grow, protect, or treat problems. ... Very limited."
3,"Good Enthusiasm, but...","Very good book on GIMP. Attempts to follow the same routine(layers,filters,etc) as do the popular Photoshop books. This is an excellent manner of presenting this information to you. This book WILL show you the possibilites of making the most beautiful art with GIMP.A notice though, alot of the related hyperlinks referenced from the book for resources (art,bitmaps) are broken. You will do alot of site jumping trying to find it."
5,I LOVE The Gimp and this book is perfect for me.,"I'm not a graphics professional by any means. I found GIMP a couple years ago and muddled through getting it to do a couple of the things I wanted. Part of my problem was the fact that I didn't know what all Photoshop could do, so I was unsure of what I could make The Gimp do! I'm completely amazed. Thank you so much for an easy to understand manual. It seems perfect for me!"
5,Way Cool Gimp Book,"I use the Gimp in my work on a day to day basis, and I thought I knew it pretty darn well. But this book has changed the way I work. It does have very good info about colorspaces and color correction, and I picked up a few things I didn't know, but for me the most valuable sections were about making selections. The section in chapter 4 on using the threshold tool to quickly make a selection mask knocked my socks off! I'm using this technique all the time now."
4,Very good examples,"I have referenced the on-line version of this book several times and found several useful ideas and techniques out of it---especially those dealing with color correction and enhancement. However, there is no comparison to actually haveing physical pages to flip through and seeing the photos ""in person"". After reading through this book, several other Photoshop tutorials available make much more sense as well. My only complaint is that there is not much attention paid to any use of plugins or ""advanced"" clone tool techniques for repairing marred photographs without destroying the natural film grain etc. Also, some of the keybinding shortcust appear to have changed, and his examples using Layer masks did not always work for me as described in the book. Overall, though, purchasing this book is a great way to support open-source projects and learn a good deal about the Gimp as well."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"I read this book looking for ideas to help supplement by regular income by doing something from home. This was NOT the book for me. Most of the suggestions were totally useless for me and required a lot of skills/education that I don't have and would have to obtain before I started. For example, two of the suggestions are Accountant and Lawyer (!). This would better have been titled as ""Careers That Allow You To Work At Home If You Want To."" Also, as a side note, the projected earnings about Medical Transcriptionist was WAY overinflated...I am doing that currently, and my mother owns her own business and makes really good money, but not the $40-$60 an hour stated in the book. That's outrageous!"
2,Did not like it!,This book did not help me at all. It was all just alist of ideas of businesses to start(I could have written it) but no concrete advise on how to start. I finally found a business I love! and it was not listed in the book.
2,Too stereotype,the ideas are quite common and don't really adapt to today's success ideas... Did not work for me
2,Not useful,"Most of the advice is useless (""Hey, you know that law degree? You could work from home as a lawyer!"") and some of it is silly and/or dangerous (""Buy a franchise to make customized children's books for $30,000 to $50,000 and make a living selling books at $15 each!"") You may find that flipping through this book is mildly interesting, but it's unlikely you'll find anything helpful. Also, most people don't think of newspaper delivering as a home business, since it involves being outside of your home the whole time."
2,"200 Best Home Businesses:Easy To Start, Fun To Run, Highly Profitable","Much reasearch went into this project, but the content was disappointing, outdated, and totally uninspiring!The cover (which sold it to me)is good, the idea brilliant, but I'd go back to the drawing board and rev it up a few notches, do much more research, add great images, print on better quality paper, make it appealing for todays' discerning women around the world who would like to have the freedom to work from home, but they need to be INSPIRED!"
2,FAIR.,"There's only a few things in this book that I didn't already know. Otherwise, it's the same as any other book on the subject."
2,disappointed,I was expecting some realistic ideas to start a home business. It seemed the majority of the ideas in this book required a substantial investment of $5K - $20k. I think there were a few for a couple hundred. Not realistic for someone looking to create wealth.
4,K Swiss Youth Athletic Shoe,"I initially purchased these shoes because they seemed to be a great price from Amazon. The shipping cost detracted from the appeal of the deal. This shoe is not solid leather on the sides - it almost has a type of mesh-looking fabric on it. They are very plain and basic looking and now, in retrospect, I think that my boys would appreciate a more ""mod"" looking shoe. I decided to keep the shoes due to the cost involved in returning them and will have my boys wear them until they are spent."
4,"Modern slavery, boy soldiers and African Diaspora","This is a fascinating account of how orphaned Sudanese displaced in struggles with northern miltias, found new lives in the US. The volume is particularly useful because it shows the connection between wars of religion and region, the slaving expeditions conducted by janjaweed Islamic militias, and the politics of recruiting for rebel liberation movements in the south. Short on arms, money, soldiers and international sympathy, the southern Sudanese seek international attention to the problems of post-colonial boundaries and rights. They have learned to use the politics of refugee camps to leverage attention and forces. The fortitude of these survivors is amazing, no matter how complicated the story of their displacement turns out to be."
5,The Lost Boys of Sudan,It is inspiring to read how The Lost Boys of Sudan started their journey and numerous challenges. It really inspired me to consider those who cannot provide or in position to help themselves.
4,Te Real Lost Boys were not from Neverland,"Without giving away anything about this book. I originally became aware of The lost Boys of Sudan from watching an episode of 7th Heaven and was intrigued. These men wen through unimaginable trials to be upheavaled into a life and a world so strange and foreign to them its mind blowing. They truly were dumped onto a strange soil and left to their own devices. Fortunately they were able to use their faith and past experience to not become a statistic and be Lost in America. I highly recommend it for most ages I would say 13 and up, I think teens would be able to identify and hopefully appreciate what they went through just to be free."
4,!!Very Cool Music!!,"I was vacationing in Athens, Greece a few years ago and the cafes I went to all played music. I kept hearing a particular song in all of the cafes- it was Everytime We Touch. That song sounded so cool, I asked the local DJ's who sings that song & they said Maggie Reilley. I was on a hunt in the local music stores for that CD. Before that, I had never heard of Maggie Reilley, but now- her album is always in my CD player!! Some of the songs sound kinda like folk music, but the ones that don't are Very cool."
4,"Child of Satan, Child of God","I read this book some years ago, and I have to admit I am tempted to read it again now that Susan Atkins has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.I found the book to be an interesting insight into how bad decisions can truly ruin one's life. I am tempted to get my son to read it when he is older to show him that the decisions he makes as a young man might follow him his whole life. I definitely do not regret reading it.As far as whether or not her conversion is real, well thats between her and God. None of us know for certain what is in her heart, but I see no obvious reason to doubt her sincerity. But I don't think that conversion should have any impact on her parole or release hearings."
1,"Silly Liar, Susan","Atkins spends the entire time regurgitating the Helter Skelter case. Enough said.For those who are interested in learning why this book can be proven false in every way- Atkins wrote a partially completed, autobiographical work shortly before her death, in which she recants everything she said in the trial, and in this book, and states that essentially, Bugliosi forced her and Kasabian to testify that Manson was a murderous brainwashing hippie satanist commie-fascist guru, in order to make sure Bugliosi had a hairy, scary looking man to crucify so that he could write his bestselling book.And that, folks, is the truth behind helter skelter- it's complete fraud foisted upon us all by a willing, sensationalist media."
1,Don't bother,I got this book when it was first published and tried to read it with an open mind. sadly Susan Atkins did have a rotten childhood. But she also chose the path she went on long before joining Manson. I think regardless of Atkins background she was going to commit crimes. I have never beleived in her so called return to Christianity. Miss Atkins was a fine little actress and unfortuantely as given a life sentence when her death sentence was over turned. I have yet to see any memeber of the Family who has come clean so to speak on their roles in the tragedy that took so many lives. They all dump it on Charlie. I tried several times reading this book to not judge Atkins or her cohorts in crime. It just isn't possible. Don't waste your time on this one.
1,Snitch,"Susan's religious conversion is a bunch of bull. She is the reason that they are all in jail- if she would have kept her mouth shut- things would have been different- she just brought everybody down with her. Susan has always wanted and probably always will want to be the center of attention. 99 % of the words from her mouth are lies, so why would her conversion be any different. Susan does whatever she has to do to get the heat off of her, if that means making up outrageous stories of non-existent murder plots or being a good christian woman to get out of jail (again- her own fault-loose lips sink ships), she will do it!"
3,"""Child of Satan, Child of God""...which is she?","Susan Atkins is very forthcoming about her troubled youth, her meeting with Charles Manson, and that horrible weekend in August 1969. I believe her religious conversion, and that when the tears and grief finally came, they were real. But the fly in the ointment is that her version of events has always changed, and she still gets unfavorable psychiatric evaluations. She claims God has forgiven her, so she needn't seek forgiveness from the Tate family. All of this is enough to make one uneasy. But it's unlikely she'll ever be released, so she can serve God just fine within her prison community."
2,Wrote with parole board in mind?,"Some aspects of this book were great. Learning about her childhood and pre-Manson days was insightful. However, I could not stop and think that most of what she wrote in this book was contradictory of what she previously said-- and what she said after. It was obviously written in hopes the parole board would read it and be somewhat influenced.She seemed to accept some responsibility, but also pawn off responsibility on others. She made Manson seem like this all-powerful man with hypnotic powers and we all know that's just total BS. Manson had no powers, no more than you or I.All in all the book was kind of dull and rehashes tired stories with twists for personal gain. It's not as bad as Helter Skelter, but only read this if you have thoroughly researched the case."
2,"Haunting, shocking, fascinating","I read this book many years ago when I was a teenager. It goes to show you how morally adrift you can get when immersed in a world of drugs, booze and sex. I don't believe that Atkins would have done half the stuff she did if she hadn't been out of her mind on drugs. She had a really self righteous tone though as I recall. It seems that she implied Sharon Tate et.al. bought on their fate because hubby Polanski was dabbling in Satanism! I don't remember much about her religious experiences - the druggy, sixties thing was much more interesting to me at the time and I certainly got my money's worth there!"
3,Hot Shot - Transformers Cybertron Deluxe,fun for the little ones but better for the 6 to 6 year olds then the 9 to 10 year olds.
4,Great features,"This curling iron has great features, like the automatic shut-off (haven't tested that yet) and a range of heat settings. I love the sleeve that fits over the iron when you are done using it; I feel that is a great safety feature to help protect my curious toddler.The dial that sets the heat level is in an awkward spot though, and while using the iron I accidentally change the setting with my thumb often. This order took forever to arrive. It was ordered the end of May and arrived in August (2004).Jan 2010 - My curling iron is over 5 years old now and still works great!"
1,does not curl!!!,"i bought this curler because I wanted to curl my hair for valentine's day. I've always used conair products but this one just didn't work. I left it in my hair for at least a minute, and my hair came out the way it started. I even tried using it with hair spray, still didn't work. I ended up taking it back an hour after I got it."
5,Reliable and effective!,I've had bad experiences with other curling irons...this one is great. So I bought one for home and one for traveling!
1,wont curl my hair,"I thought this curler was the best of the best being a well known brand and ""ceramic."" I was wrong. I paid $30 bucks for this thing and it didn't even curl my hair. I will go back to using the $10 generic curlers. I regret my purchase. I also regret throwing away the box before trying it, so I can't send it back now!"
1,What a load of...,"It's frustrating that otherwise intelligent people are being won over by such patently obtuse arguments that utilize methods of diagnosis that have been conclusively proven to do nothing except cost the person being tested a load of money. True science does not utilize scare tactics. While amalgam may not be pretty to look at, it has a proven record of efficacy with low adverse reactions (approx. 100 cases of true allergy in 150 years). These are the same people that are against fluoridation. A dentist who promotes no amalgams and no fluoride to their patients can expect a larger profit margin from the increase in decay and the inherently higher cost of the resin material used in place of amalgam. People who think that professional organizations such as the ADA and AGD are perpetuating some sort of cover up for their own benefit are sadly mistaken. Do me a favor- Take a good look at who is operating for the benfit of whom."
5,ESL,Excellent book. It's an excellent resource book for ESL teachers as well as for Resource and English teachers. It will help adults too.
4,Fun,I got this after I saw it on a youtube channel. very fun but things get messy when you try to take it out of the water but that is expected. Don't mix the colors together or else it won't look good as when they are isolated.
4,Mission UK - God is a Bullet,I'm a huge fan. So this adds to my collection I started since about 1989.Wayne still has the touch with all his music. I recommend it. Now if we can just get him to tour the US in the south. That would make it better. :-)
5,Great Book,"I know Tom Hegg personaly, he is a great guy. The book is very warm and sentimental. If you liked ""A Cup..."" you'll love this one. BUY IT PLEASE"
3,Decent book for the most part,"On the positive side, Prochnow's candid writing style makes this book very entertaining to read. Most of the projects (but not all) are interesting too including replacing Robosapien's feet with a tank tread based traction system, turning him into an alarm clock or using him as a virtual wall for your roomba. Some seem silly and out-of-place however like the chapter on dressing up Robosapien in paper clothes. On the negative side, the author assumes the reader already possesses a basic working knowledge of electronics and schematic diagrams and as such completion steps for many projects are overly simplistic without the hand holding that most beginners would need."
2,I can't really rate this item...,"Why? because I was expectin something else, but first of all, I didn't expect that you have to open/make a hole in your Robosapiens to modify it, so forget it! i will not damage my Robot."
4,"Not the ones I got in Germany recently, but....","I ate them all anyway. There are new flavors for gummi bears that I got in Germany in October and these were not the same, so I was a little disappointed. But these are still better than what you get in the supermarket, so every now and then they're worth the splurge..."
3,I expected more for price,It's a nice size heating pad. Works ok so far. Cord gets tangled very easily. Heat settings are good. Priced too high.
5,POWERFUL AND INSPIRING,"THIS BOOK IS TRULY ANOINTED. WHEN YOU PICK IT UP IT IS HARD TO PUT IT DOWN. YOU FEEL THE WORDS AS YOU READ THE WORDS. I FOUND MYSELF THINKING AS I READ THROUGH THE POEMS ""GEE, I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS, OR BEEN THERE."" WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU FEEL GOD'S POWER THROUGH HER WORDS. IT IS POWERFUL AND WARM. HER WORD'S ARE FILL WITH GOD'S WARMTH AND SPIRIT. IT HELPS THE WOUNDED AND CAN SET YOU FREE. YOU FEEL HER WORDS AND GOD'S SPIRIT. THIS BOOK IS A WINNER. I ENCOURAGE ALL TO BUY AND BE UPLIFTED."
2,Web information is much cheaper than this book,"After reading this book, I am truly disappointed. Almost all the information found inside is available on the Overeasters Annonymous website...for free. It was a lot of pages that ends up saying ""don't each sugar"" (duh) and then gives you a very strict meal plan (no - sugar meal plans are also all over the web for free). There is too much information on the web to spend $10 on this."
2,unreasonable,"I'm sorry, but honestly, I bought both of her books, read a few chapters, and I just don't like her approach to food. Food is an addiction, yes, but I think it is unreasonable to live the rest of your life without some flour, some sugar, some good fat, and boiled meat!!!?? jesus, the day I have to eat boiled meat, just put a fork in me, I'm done and on my way to straight up deprivation binge cycles or anorexia. eating is a privelage and one of life's great pleasures, people who are healthy are priveleged to have this pleasure but life needs balance. I think of the my many relatives that have had cancer and could not eat.Even though I think Sheppard has some great connections about food and addiction, I think her approach is too extreme and not mind/body focused enough, and frankly I just didn't like her. Kudos to those she has helped, get it where you can! But, I don't think this is a five star book - going back to Geneen Roth"
3,Interesting reading ...,"... but I didn't join the Kool-aid group on the total abstinence from flour, sugar and wheat products. Attended a few meetings and found that even though some long-time followers were Ok with one that didn't follow the letter of the law, a few were too radical about it. I found another way to permanently lose and sustain weight loss. Very informative, though!"
3,repeated version,This book was no different than the first version. I was rather disappointed.The first edition was good and I lost 100 lbs but I expected recipes and more meal plans with this one.
3,Interesting...but quite a taxing plan to follow,"This book is well written and informative. It has a very thourough plan of healing...but you can never again eat any food with sugar, wheat or flour in it."
4,Solid staring point,"This is a good starting point for food addicts. Ms. Sheppard offers much valuable information. However, the tone of the book, a bit exclusionary and black and white, can be offputting. It's necessary to overlook that in order to appreciate the valuable information this book contains."
5,"This makes sense, actually helping me to change easily.","For a lifetime, I have struggled with food addiction. I still am a food addict. After following Kay Sheppard's suggestions, and the program, however, for the first time I felt ""normal."" By just changing my eating habits according to this plan, and attending meetings supporting this plan, my dress size went from 16 to 6-8. I had more energy, more interest in other things, and, best of all, I felt good and balanced physiologically. I KNOW THAT MY FOOD ADDICTION IS JUST A BITE AWAY. And, I believe the elimination of all refined foods is essential to recovery from this disease."
2,Leaks...,"Lube is great but this particular container leaks, even in upright position. It was leaking on arrival and continued. Of course it was no problem returning with amazon's stellar customer service. Go with the smaller size bottle."
1,Don't be mislead!,This is a book review which costs $5.95. There is no information about the subjects mentioned in the description! It is only a review and a waste of $5.95!
3,Pea-nuts,"Not nearly as much as you would expect. Two decent bagsdidnt even fill my friends front seats in his car. thats what i used them for, a practical joke."
2,Not what I thought,Sixty gallons seems like it would be a lot! On top of that it was two small bags that would barely fill two bushel baskets. I felt ripped off and the post office made me come to pick them up. In my opinion not a good buy.
5,What more can I say?,La Dona is quite simply one of the best CDs I have ever listened to in my life! It is absolutely lovely. A must have for the Teena Marie fan and anyone else who enjoys good music. She is a musical genius!
4,Not Bad,"I've been listening to T since back in the day. Teena's voice is just as fresh as ever. It's nice to see that she's a happy woman and content with life and love. You can tell this in her music and voice. This CD is jazzy and smooth but I much prefer and miss the young Teena going through the growing pains and complexities of live and love in her earlier albums. I really miss the belting, soulful and sultry deeply passionate songs like Cassanova Brown, Yes Indeed, Dear Lover, Tune in Tomorrow, Miracles Need Wings to Fly, Where's California. This CD is more easy listening and not bad but not her best."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I guess I am in the minority here because I bought the CD over the weekend and hated it. All of the songs should have been performed by anyone other than Teena Marie. They all sounded quite similar in that she talks on each one and the constant reference to being Lady Tee was annoying. I'll take her old style of music like Ooh La La La, Square Biz, Lovergirl, etc. Leave the moaning and talking to the current wave of no-talent songbirds that are out there today. Teena should be raising the roof with her pipes not whispering and talking us to sleep."
5,BACK with a VENGANCE !,"Apollo worthy. With this CD, Teena proves to her critics that she can return to the music fold after a long absence and create a powerful CD. Her fresh vocal performance should place several current R/B divas to shame. This CD is a musical package that is a huge gift to an audience. It will be easily playable in several years cause the performance and production is solid. The strong quality of the material is not dated nor is it over the top. Teena offers a powerful yet controlled musical performance on this CD that could be rated as sheer RB classic. This CD is perfection. Vocally she shines amongst the ranks of legendary RB artists mentioned and paid homage to on the track MAKAVELLI. TEENA is R/B. You should seriously consider adding this CD to your R/B collection. It's HOT!"
4,You Go Teena Marie!!!,"After hearing Teena Marie's performance on Aretha Franklin's Walk of Fame on BET(this was my first time ever hearing of or hearing Teena Marie), I wasn't sure if I really liked/appreciated her style or her voice and I was disappointed by her performance. After listening a Teena Marie CD for the first time (which was of course La Dona), I have changed my mind. Teena Marie has pipes! She has such a very wide range and a great, great voice. She gives me chills when she has no trouble at all hitting notes in the upper register (her high A was belted out so easily I was truly, truly impressed). I loved ""A Rose by Any Other Name"" and ""Makavelli Never Lied"" and I pinpoint those as my favorites. Her voice just has a quality to it that the music industry has missed over her decade hiatus. Her album is different and I believe distinctive from other albums and lack cliches making it distinctive. Welcome back Teena Marie. Keep doing your thing!!! 4 1/2 stars!!!"
5,Stir it up Lady T !,"I'm diggin' the new vibes on this CD a lot. It's been way too long since we have had an official new release from Teena. I can see that she hasn't been wasting her time though and is giving us some very nice stuff lyrically and musically. Teena seems to be in a new place, very comfortable with delivering her songs with a relaxed pace, almost too relaxed at times - I still love to hear her give us the full voice, loud, long held notes she has become famously associated with. Teena has still got it vocally, just excercised more overall restrain in her vocal delivery. This CD is a must have for all long time and new Lady T fans. You go Teena, keep on impressing us fans!"
5,PURE TEENA! SHE'S ON FIRE!,"THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE HEARD, N A LONG TIME. I LISTEN 2 ""BABY IM YOUR FIEND"", ""BLACK RAIN"", AND ""IM ON FIRE"" EVERYDAY! tHEY R 2 PERFECT 2 PUT N2 WORDS. THEY CANT TOUCH MY PERSONAL FAVORITES: ""PORTUGUESE LOVE"", ""OUT ON A LIMB"", ""FIRE & DESIRE"", ""HAPPY"" (BEAUTIFUL DUET WITH RICK JAMES(CHECK IT OUT)), AND ""DEAR LOVER"". TEENA MARIE IS A GODDESS AND IS TRULY LEGENDARY, THE ONLY THING MISSING 2 MAKE HER A SHINING STAR IS MORE VIDEOS, BUT SHE IS AN INSPIRATION 100%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Teena at her best!,"I haven't found anything wrong with this CD! her duet with Gerald Levert is ""OFF THE HOOK"", ""My Body's Hungry"" is PURE TEENA!! With each listen I find a new favorite, which is often placed on repeat. Teena's release of this Cd was perfect timing, my daughter age 35, and some of her friends fell in love with Teena as teenagers listening to my LPs, she has 3 generations of fans loving her, and her music. La Dona is a great album, a must for all of Teena's fans."
3,"Good, but hard to call it a classic","If your a Teena Marie fan, you 'll appreciate how strong and clear her voice is, and hasn't lost anything on that. However, I found the many street references got old after awhile. Sounded too much like she was trying too hard to be accepted by the hip hop crowd. She doesn't need to do that, the soul she has in her is easily displayed by her vocals. However the cd has a number of notable tunes that make up for some of its short comings. Some of my favorites were ""Hit Me Where I Live"",""Makaveli Never Lied"", ""My Body's Hungry"", ""A Rose By Any Other Name"" and ""Black Rain"" and ""Still in Love"" to name a few."
3,Love the radio edit of the single.,"When Teena Marie was regularly topping the charts, I never liked her. However, when I heard the radio edit of the single 'I'm still in love' - I had to have it - it was great! Sort of a cross between Martha Reeves (in her prime) and Syleena Johnson. When I got the cd, I was not pleased that they have this rap intro which was not what was played on the radio. This has been particularly frustrating lately, when you hear a song on the radio, buy the cd, and the cuts are not the same. While I don't condone it, I understand why kids are copying music from the Internet, so they can get the song they heard on the radio and NOT the version the record company sticks you with. The radio edit would have been a pleasurable bonus to this cd."
2,it's aight,I've always been a fan of Lady T&of course been waiting for this album.but after hearing it something was missing&It just didn't move me that much.glad to hear her with Gerald Levert&Of Course Rick James.some good runs in the instrumentation department&She had some nice vocal Runs but the album just never got cooking for me.
2,Where's the funk?,"I'm a big fan of Lady T but what happened? I wasextremely disappointed. If you are looking for someeasy listening jazz/R&B music, then this is a great pick.There is no energy in this album. Her past recordingshave always had some great upbeat tunes with great energy.You know how her old music has a lot of intruments? Well, thissounds like all the rest. I just kept asking myself, where is all the funk? I only knew it was her because she has an outstanding voice.Don't waste your money. Just keep listening to the old stuff."
3,It's About Time!,"It's always exciting to her new material from Teena Marie.""La Dona"" finds her still in the r-n-b pocket but alsoupdating her style with more of a hip-hop edge. She's always been one to stay current while also paying tribute to the musical heritage she comes from. Some of it works (Honey Call), some of it sounds like parody (Off The Chain). It would have been nice had she not had so many guests but they seem to compliment her vibe. She's most enjoyable when she's alone and doing jazzier and ballad material like ""Baby I'm Your Fiend"" ""I'm On Fire"" and ""Hit Me Where I Live."" She sounds so relaxed which is nice. She's not bowling you over with vocal riffs as much as she seemed to in the past. She's allowing themusic and the lyrics to work their magic on the listener. I hope this album gives her much acclaim and sells well. It's great she found a record label that finally appreciates her."
4,A Lovely Legend,"I heard LaDona at a hair salon and enjoyed especially the collaborations with G.LeVert and Rick James. What makes this CD so special is the range from a latin feel..to jazz ..to hip hop.. to R&B. This is a nice listening mix that can appeal to all ages. Saying goodbye to Tina is hard, but the gift that she left behind will live on for generations."
5,Bear Family Records Did Us a Big Favor,"If you want all of the early Marty Robbins songs, then this is the set to buy! You pay a higher price for Bear Family products than you do for some others, but they are worth every penny! For instance, this particular 5 CD set came in a beautiful box the size of an album. There is a 50 page booklet (the same size as the box) that tells the history of Marty's entrance into the recording industry. Bear Family puts a lot of research into their records and the result is an excellent product. The music of Marty Robbins will live on thanks to companies like this."
4,A good book about self,Your name is important. It is a symbol of you. That must be why parents try so hard to find the perfect name for their children. Lucy finds many ways to enjoy her name over the 7 years of her life. This would also make a good book when studying growing up. You also get to watch her grow from a baby to a 7 year old while she goes from playing in her icing name to scribbling and finally being able to write it in cursive. Michael enjoyed this book quite a bit. I have it recommended for ages 4-8 years.
3,A good story about the French Revolution.,"A Tale of Two cities to me, was a good story. I liked how it took place during the French Revolution. I also liked how the characters were well brought out in the novel. Charles Darnay was my favorie character. I liked how he was always there for his friends and his loved ones. Sidney Carton also was one of my favorite characters. I liked how he took the place of Darnay so Darnay could still live and be with his wife and child. Even though Carton loved Luciee too, he did what he thought was best. I liked how there were bad and good guys in the story also. I think it should've ended in a different way though. But other than that, the story was very good in my opionion and I think more people in the world should read it."
2,comment on cover art,The cover photo for the CD is from the Hunt CD set-about 20 years ago.Hunt Cd# 518.........
3,Two Thumbs Up !!!!!!,"Es un Excelente Artista y la cancion Antes es un equilibrio perfecto entre musica y palabras, algo recomendable al momento de necesitar relajacion."
5,cant get enough,"i have to say i rarely buy spanish cd's, but this one i just had to buy, i cant get enough of the song ""antes"" . i havent even met a person that told me they did not like this song. its definately worth adding to your personal music library."
5,The Best,"I'm Heidy,originally from Arecibo Puerto Rico;living in Florida. This album is the best. Obie is one of the best singers. He's got a voice that will always remain in your head, I hope that he gets the fame he deserves, w/ this album.Thanks Heidy :)"
1,disappointed,"ORIENTAL MUSIC (DULL) AND ORIENTAL COSTUMES (THE BEST PART OF THE OPERA)SUNG IN ENGLISH BY PERFORMERS WITH ACCENTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.THANK GOODNESS FOR SUBTITLES.IN ADDITION, THE LIBRETTO IS AWFUL!WHAT A BORE! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.AND, BELIEVE ME, I'M A BIG DOMINGO FAN."
1,Not my taste,"I will buy this DVD one day when I can buy it cheaply simply because we decided to collect all the Domingo DVD's. Too many CD's to try and have the whole collection so we will go for the DVD's. We saw this performance live and Placido's acting and singing was amazing but we did not enjoy the music. We actually had tickets for a 2nd performance and for the first time ever decided not to attend a 2nd performance and asked the concierge to sell them as it was a sold out performance. We just could not not sit through another boring performance. If you like Tan Dun, you will probably love this opera but it is just not my taste - I agree with the person who said it was boring. I would say rent it before you buy it as I would rather spend my money on another DVD."
3,"great mouse, horrible software","if someone could make decent software fo this mouse, it would be my favorite. however, i have yet to ge a game to recognize the joysticks. for those that like large mice, it's great."
4,twelve programable buttons for $32,"I bought this mouse to work with Blender3D. With S&H; + taxes it cost me $32.The normal mouse functions work fine. And it has twelve programmable ""buttons"".It has two extra buttons which are not programmable. They work as Back and Forward buttons, handy for web surfing. Pressing them together changes the DPI. I have no need for that feature, and I wish they where programmable.The software could be better. It should switch profiles automatically, depending on which program you're running. Instead you have to manually select the profile you want, from a list.Since I just got this I can only speculate on durability (I'm not sure replacing WASD with a hat switch is a good idea, but I haven't tried it).I like the feel of it better than my old one (may not be as good if you have small hands)."
1,Music 3.5; production 0-,"If you want a children's cartoon, this Hansel and Gretel is for you. If you want opera, this is a travesty!Anthony Rossi wrote, ""It seems to be popular today to take a composer's creation and twist it into something totally unrecognizable from the original libretto."" Bravo, Anthony! Unfortunately, this is what the Met is doing with almost all their new productions.First, there is no logic in saying that this opera takes place in three kitchens. It does not; it takes place in the cottage, in the woods, and at the gingerbread house. Waiters in pig faces have no place in the story. And the greatest travesty of all is the Jerry Lewis/Three Stooges approach to the witch. She (he) is supposed to be frightening, not maniacally hysterical. If you want a food fight, go to Animal House.Besides a terrible production, the singing is not up to the usual Met standards.I am delighted that I saw this first on television and did not waste my money buying the dvd."
3,"Fun to watch, but a few things bothered me","I have to say that I enjoyed this production, even though it was weird and darker than usual. I feel like I understood where they were trying to go with it, but they weren't very successful. The biggest problem that I had while watching this was the diction (mostly Christine Schafer) and the horrible new translation. I rather liked Alice Coote as Hansel. I especially like Sasha Cook! Overall, an ""ok"" production, but there are other really nice ones (the movie version with Gruberova) I also agree with the first commenter about the HD production of Il Trittico, I really hope they release that one soon."
4,Interesting update and staging,"Purists may decry the translation into English instead of the standard German, however it does not feel as if anything was lost. The unique staging and an update into modern times makes the opera quite enjoyable. Those who complain about the ""over the top"" staging may be forgetting that the story is supposed to be from a child's point of view. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the witch by a man in drag, with heavily exaggerated features. The kitchen scene with flour flying and modern appliances screaming was quite effective."
1,"a pathetic, bastardized, take and mess on a children's fairy tale","I too saw this mess of a production. I had to put my two sense in and say something. I remember seeing this monstrosity when it aired on PBS and was horrified at what I saw. Pigs instead of angels? Now really, this was going a bit too far. I personally have the 1982 version of the Metropolitan opera . It was a stupendous production. But this was a disaster... The music and performances were top notch. but the plot and characterizations with pig faces . It is apparent what the Grimm brothers were expressing in their story but this was going too far... imaginative, innovative, i think not a mess is what I call it... and that is being nice... If you want a wonderful production of the treasure ""Hansel and Gretel"" choose the 1982 production. It is a sumptuous delight for adults and children...."
5,My son loves this show,He loves all it has to give. He loves how he shows new things. He keeps him on his watch list.
5,My Son is a Fan!,I hope these come to DVD soon. My son loves the show and watches the show on Amazon PRIME. The show is educational and entertaining!
3,came damaged,"The sealer itself worked on my gutter, but the tip was broken (leaving a gap right at the base of the tip near the tube) so i had to use a rubber glove and my finger tip to stick it to the seam in the gutter instead of a caulking gun. I think it was probably damaged in shipping."
1,Trashaway!,"Talk about stupid history--this writer should be in the book somewhere. Some good items in the front but then Fenster let his left-wing liberal views shine as bright as his negative attitude toward virtually everything. Not the least bit cute or funny. He should have quit while he was ahead on a few items, instead, it looks like he tossed about for any liberal trashy ideas to insert as filler. Don't buy this one. Thank goodness (and there is goodness in the world!) I only paid one dollar for it at a book sale. Not even worth that but at least I discovered how seemingly hate-filled some liberals are, as if I didn't already know. Oh, did I say something about accuracy? Don't look for it in this book. Trashaway! It deserves a zero star."
1,What a stupid book,"The first couple of chapters, which probably sold the publisher on the idea, are amusing enough, but I was constantly irritated by the author's opinions and snide comments woven throughout the book. As one reviewer put it, it's as if he thinks the reader isn't smart enough to understand the humor of stupidity on its face.The book steers clear of controversial subjects that show the history of stupidity, such as sexual ideals developed during the Victorian age. Thus, it's nowhere near a complete history. It's not a terrible book to keep next to the toilet, but the author's comments only add to the stink in the room."
4,1 star???,"I don't even know the guy who gave this one star, but just reading his commentary makes me believe he should be chapter 1 in this book."
3,"Somewhat amusing, somewhat disappointing","A good book to read once, but I regret buying it. While most of the stories are fun, they are (mostly?) urban legends. The book ""Darwin Awards"" was better since it told which stories were confirmed to be true.I was also disappointed by misinformation in the book, even with my education I knew many things to be false. At times the author's attitude is presented too strongly.All in all, not a bad book, but I still prefer the ""Darwin Awards"" series of books when I want to laugh at human stupidity."
4,Good design,"This is the third one I've owned over many years. The design remains unchanged for good reason. I carry a lot of stuff and use it 5-7 times a week. It has enough pockets to keep things organized. The exposed ball carrier has probably saved me several balls over the years. It's very obvious when you left the ball at the field, something I've been know to do.They do, eventually, wear out. Funny, mine always fail at the same spot another reviewer mentioned... The seam near the zipper. That's not really a stress point. I wish I could sew. I'd give it a five stars if they lasted longer. I do use mine a lot, so I don't know if this is a problem or not."
5,Diadora Pallone Team Bag,Ideal product. This is the second one I have ordered. Well made and practical. Will definately order more in the future or similar products. Great for players and coaches.Also well packaged with quick postage and resonalbe rates.Many thanks!!
2,Diadora Pallone Team Bag,"The bag has ripped at the seam near zipper after using for 2 weeks. Nothing too heavy has been carried in the bag, used for soccer shoes, shinguards and some books. Very unhappy with this product for the price I paid."
4,Christmas present,"I bought this present as a replacement for my grandson's old duffle bag. He loved it. He is a wrestling coach and is able to place all kinds of things in it, plus his dirty clothes can be placed in the outside pouch. This was a lucky purchase for me as I know nothing about duffle bags. Once again, AMAZON to the rescue. Great product!"
4,Great Book!,This is the best book I have read in a long time. I read it in 2 days. I couldn't put it down! It was a great combination of history and passion. I really thought the author knew her history. It was also very interesting to see how people from two different worlds could fall so completely in love.
5,An excellent intoduction for beginners,"this is an excellent introduction for beginners. in fact, this reference has explained the differential equations, the dynamical system and the chaos as clear as possible. the elementary mathematical analysis, the matrix analysis and ordinary differential equation should be mastered before starting on this book."
3,I'm biased,"I took a theoretical course in differential equations and we happened to use this book. I was always told this was a really good book and such, but I just didn't like it. I'm not sure what it is (I'm not a huge fan of differential equations so maybe I'm biased), but I just didn't feel like I connected with the book ever. I didn't cover it all, only Chapters 1-9 and chapter 17 and I did think chapter 17 was covered very nicely (Existence and Uniqueness Theorems), but the other stuff which was mainly on planar systems not so well. I plan on re-reading the book again just to see if I'm just missing the entire picture because one of the authors is Stephen Smale and so I would expect good things from it all. I'll edit my review then and see if anything has changed."
4,Excellent collection of songs (for die hard fans),"This will not be for everyone (hence 4 and not 5 stars) but if you really love R.E.M. this is a gem. Note that all tracks could have fitted on a single disc. I second Ben Morse in that even the 'silly' songs are great. Top tracks: Fretless, First We Take Manhattan, Winged Mammal Theme."
5,kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiikkkkkkkkkkkin!,"This is a kik butt set, along w/. the rest of R.E.M&gt"
2,Selection of related science fiction stories.,"For those of you that like a little psycodelia, and mystism in your Sci-fi, this is a book for you.This novel sounds more like it was written in the late sixties than early eighties. Be therefore advised."
2,Garland Disappointed,"I have read another book by the author as Yolanda Joe and I that was an enjoyable read. HIT TIME was not. At first it had me going but soon I got very bored. What bothered me most was the language. I love to read books by my sisters because I can relate but Garland seemed to go overboard. Words like ""sister twin"" made me wanna gag. I mean all she had to do was throw in a few ""chiles"" and ""girls"" and it would have been a real live ethnic read. Come on Garland.Over all the story was okay as it had a twist but I could have passed on this one."
4,Scapegoat Complex Study Review,"Great book. Very insightful. Such an interesting history to the complex. For all who may be suffering from Scapegoat Complex, this is definitely a must have."
5,well-written,The book takes us on an insightful voyage through characters as they respond to tragedy. The responses of each person reveal the characters. Deep.
4,very good for the money,My factory sub in my 13 year Lincoln Towncar finally rotted so I took a chance on this speaker after checking what some people used on the Lincoln blogs with the same problem. This speaker sounds great and for the money is a great value. The contruction seems very good. The speaker came very quickly and was pakaged well.
5,Great replacement for Jeep Wrangler,"I bought this as a replacement subwoofer for my 2004 Jeep Wrangler. Very happy with the quality and the sound. I wasn't looking for shaking bass or a high end sound so this was perfect. It is a definite improvement over stock and for the price you can't beat it. It's been installed for 2 weeks now and it still works great. The quality is surprisingly well for the brand and price. I listen to mostly hard rock and have pushed it volume wise with no problems. It works great for what I need it for. I figure until I can afford a more high end subwoofer this will suit my needs great. So happy to hear bass again and no crackling from the blown stock one. If anyone considers this for a jeep, wranglerforum.com has a post with great directions for installing."
2,Put in my 2005 jeep wrangler center console,Installed it in my jeep because the factory sub was blown when we bought it. The sound out first was weak. Bass was on max. Sometimes it would sound okay. Just enough to fill in some missing bass. Sometimes it just sounded bad. The sub would try to hit hard but then u wouldnt hear much. 2 months later it stopped working. Not a very good replacement. Your better off going to quadratic and buying the only real factory replacement subwoofer for a jeep wrangler. Its like $80. Havent tried it yey but cant find anything else so may have to give it a try.
3,Real power is nowhere close to declared.,"First of all, box clearly says ""mounting hardware and template included"". My box was definetly factory sealed, and no template or mounting hardware to be found inside.I connected this speaker to amplifier, fed it with 100hz sine signal, hooked control mic to the oscilloscope and started looking for distortions, while increasing the output power. To be short, this speaker is OK for powers up to 25W. Above that power, distortions become very noticeable. This is not RMS, ""Musical"" or ""PMPO"" watts. These are plain watts, calculated by ohms law formula. So, consider this observation, if you plan to buy this woofer.Anyways, I was not expecting top performance from this speaker, and it is very nice for price it costs."
4,Good sound for little $,"I put these into a box and powered them with a Boss R1002 RIOT. It does the job, good supplementary bass. Nothing to shake your rib cage, but if you're looking to for a little bump it does the trick. That was Summer 2011 and they're still pumpin. I suspect people are overpowering them according to the high RMS, it's not necessary."
4,Replacement for factory sub on 94' Lincoln Town Car,"I did a lot of research in looking for a subwoofer to replace the blown factory sub in my 1994 Lincoln Town Car. I chose this one for the price and the good reviews, particularly one review where this sub was put in a similar car. I installed it over the weekend and it sounds great. For the price, you can't go wrong."
2,"Bought Two, One Worked","I bought these a few months ago. For some reason, only one works right, the other one sounds like the voice coil is blown. What a piece of crap. I'm only running 150 watts to the speakers as well."
4,"For the price, Awesome","Used this to replace a factory sub and would buy another in a heartbeat. If you're a serious audiophile, you will not be happy with the sound, but if you're looking for a cheap replacement that sounds okay. This is it."
3,Good sound for your dollar,"There aren't many 6"" woofers out there. I purchased the speakers replacing my 2002 Sienna JBL woofers ($15+shipping=$24 per speaker). Granted this is not top of the line product, but the sound that came out of these speakers was clear enough."
1,Crap!,"This product is not well made, quit working after less than a month of use, using a 50 watt amp, woofer quit operating due to a bad voice coil and poorly wired terminals. Do not buy this product!"
3,Writing Gets in the Way,"This novel, which I looked forward to reading, was somewhat of a disappointment. It's one of those novels in which a cloying MFA-driven writing style gets in the way of what could have been a riveting story. The novel follows too many of the precepts of what is expected in ""quality"" fiction: quirky characters, an intrusive and forced writing style (sentence fragments abound), and a general sense that most of the material in the novel was researched, not lived.The novel seems more like a response to an assignment than a work of art. As a response to an assignment, it, of course, earns an ""A."" As a novel, it's a ""B-."""
3,Loved it right up to the end,"Well done, and I think it's admirable that an academic doesn't have to succumb to ""magic realism,"" or some such potted meat, but it seems that much of Zafris' effort goes into getting two girls to kiss."
1,EntirelyPets does not ship Elastikon,"This product is another brand, Elastiant, and is also not 5 yards, but 2.5. When requested, EntirelyPets refunded the whole order. But they do not even stock 5 yards of Elastikon."
5,"Ray Bonneville's ""Goin by Feel""","Ordered the CD by a review I read somewhere, did not know Ray's music and after listening I had that rare feeling of hitting Bull's Eye: Southern rythmn, captivating voice, fascinating lyrics... GREAT MUSIC.I will be buying more from him."
4,Great heater,"I was a little worried about my skills in putting this together based upon some of the reviews, but it was really easy (this coming from someone who took three hours to put together a grill!).Pros:1. It puts out a lot of heat.2. There's little smell.3. Easy to assemble (I wouldn't even call it assembly since it took all of five minutes).Cons:1. Handle (as described by other buyers).2. A full tank won't last 11-12 hours, even on the lowest heat setting. Based on our limited experience, it'll last about 9-10 hours."
4,Good,It works very well and will save us from the EVER escalting electicity costs!!! Thanks - have emailed pictures of the product going to other people I know in Australia and they will by off you!
2,Sengoku CV-2230,"I have had a Kerosun kerosene heater for 20 years. I assumed that this heater would perform equally, however it has a smell unlike any kerosene heater I've ever had. I have followed the instructions closely including ""dry burning"" without eliminating the fume smell."
2,It could be better,"I have owned this heater for one week. It heats my 1100 sq ft house very well. However, There is a definite problem. It will shut itself off. The manual shutoff is malfunctioning. If you walk by, it will shut off abruptly. I tried to call the company but they are in Japan and are closed after 5pm. I would tell people to reconsider this company due to this problem. The other problem I have is the getting the flames to just the minimum height. I will remind you this is brand new. I have owned this type of kerosene heaters for 15 plus years and this is the first malfunctioning one I have ever owned."
4,Out of the box and into service,"My heater arrived quickly ( 2 days ). There was a minimal amount of assembly and I had harder time finding a place nearby that sold 1-K kerosene ( OSH ) . The assisted lighting works great and flame is nicely regulated, the only negative is the kerosene smell which is a given with an open flame. I live in a 1200 sq. ft. house with one wall heater. I would recommend the CV-2230 as a nice effective supplemental heater."
5,"Burn, baby, burn","My garage is cold. The heater makes it warm. Good s***, Vern. Well worth the price for effectiveness & portability."
4,Good for an emergency,"We bought this kerosene heater to have in case of an emergency. We brought it inside to test it out. You will want to fill it outside to reduce kerosene smell.PROS:*It warms the room nicely. (A neighbor used a similar kerosene heater to heat theirhome for several days while their furnace was out, it heated most of their house)*Fuel is readily available at your local hardware store in sealed cans.*PortableCONS:*It is heavy and somewhat difficult to move.*There will be an odor when you turn it off so we take it outside."
2,"Sengoku CV-2230 KeroHeat Convection 23,000-BTU Portable Kerosene..","This really was disappointing for me. I could not get the flame to blue no matter what , although it may have just needed a new wick. I wasn't going to try to fix something that was suppose to be brand new. It is good workmanship, but filled the house with kerosene smell no matter what I tried as far as adjusting wick and using k-1 fuel. I may have had a bad wick. I really wouldn't try this brand again myself though."
1,What a disappointment!!,"I read the reviews - mostly good - and I bought one. I had no trouble assembling the heater, but when I lit it for the first time I couldn't get the flame adjusted to the level shown in the instructions. Even on the lowest setting the flame burned about two inches high. I let it burn outside for ten minutes, then allowed it to cool down. I brought it indoors and in the process dropped it on my hardwood floor because the poorly designed handle popped out of place.When I lit the heater my house quickly filled with smoke and fumes. The top of the heater is blackened. There is something about adjusting the height of the wick that isn't right, and it's not as simple as the directions describe. I read one review that suggested taking it apart and trimming the wick with scissors to correct this problem.I have another suggestion. Buy a different product. I'm going to. This thing is going back tomorrow morning. There are multiple quality control issues with this heater."
1,Miss leading BTUs,"While the 23,000BTUs sound wonderful in an uninsulated garage it is worthless. I left the heater to set for an hour, checking on it twice for wick burn. The garage started at 19 degrees and after an hour was at 23 degrees. A fire barrel would do a better job.Hopefully I can return it and get another Torpedo, sure its noisy and needs a plug, but it actually works."
1,not safe,"We bought this product at Walmart last year. It did fine the first winter. This year, no matter how we tweek the ""can"" inside,or adjust the wick, it continuously flames up, bellowing smoke into the room. We had some trouble only occassionaly at first,and now, it's everytime we turn it on.I am throwing it away, as it's not safe to use."
4,Works well,"Works well, the flame seems to not be consistent all around and I have to leave it on the lowest setting at all times, but it works."
4,Just OK,"My basement is temporarily unheated and I purchased this heater and two others. The other two are the Mr. Heater propane heater and the Sengoku 10,000.This heater does put out a lot of heat and I thought the construction was adequate. The handle did seem a little flimsy (as other reviewers have commented) but I thought it would have held up fine. The deal breaker for me was that is left a kerosene odor when it ran. The Sengoku 10,000 and the Mr. Heater give off no odor. Maybe the trade off is to be expected - quite a bit more heat but some odor.I returned this one and purchased another Sengoku 10,000."
2,"quick delivery, good box, very flimsy construction","I have had kerosene heaters before - several times. This one was very flimsy despite careful assembly. The carrying handle, as others have noted is weak, flexable, and thin and ALSO will not stay installed. As others have also noted, I should go to a hardware store and get wire clips - hoping they know what I am talking about. The top sheet metal ""hat"" pops off and the base does not stay attatched well after sliding the main section sideways under the clips (epoxy perhaps?). I prefer to refuel outside (just a few feet) but this unit is made to be installed and never moved. I am surprised some federal agency has not gotten into this. I hope some clip and a few sheet metal screws can upgrade this unit. I wonder if $1.00 extra at the factory would cure these problems. As to operation and flame control - I am still learning to work it so have no feedback yet. With a winter storm coming it might be useful."
1,Huh?,"Oddly enough, Amazon's search engine brought me here when I was searching for ""Blue Man Group""....unfortunately, the closest we get is the Blue Danube. Wonderful though it might be, it's NOT Blue Man Group.Let me reiterate, there is NO Blue Man Group at all on this CD. Not even one track. None. Niente. Nada.Heck, they aren't even Austrian. Or Australian, for that matter.Good search engine, Amazon. Way to go."
5,1970-80's Style popcorn... Before the microwave,"What a flash back. It is amazing how many people have never seen this before. Well worth buying, especially for a conversation piece. Great tasting popcorn!"
4,Cute barn,"I bought this for my 6 year old niece as a birthday gift. She loved it and so do my 10, 5 and 1 year old sons. The barn is pretty large but it folds closed to store all the horses and equipment. Good quality construction for a fair price."
2,Virgin Mummies,"I am a big fan of B movies, but this one lacks everything except a few naked girls. Many of the genre are much better; more girls and better production values.Try instead The Mummy's Kiss, Mummy's Kiss 2nd Dynasty, and Blood Scarab."
2,Horrid,"The only decent actor is Bob the bar owner...and even he was no good. I would only watch this movie for a ""what not to do"" in film making..."
2,attack of the virgin mummies,"This movie was sub par at best. I've seen worse but it was very badly acted and the story was not very creative. I've seen hundreds of B type movies and you can do alot with a small budget and some decent writing and humor. This film does have some pretty girls, Hannah Harper among them. It is watchable and not too long but that's about it."
2,Car desk disappointing,Very over priced. Nice idea but not worth more than $5. I found one on sale and supplied with markers for $4 so I felt burned.
4,perfect for on the go,"I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter and it is perfect for entertainment in the car. It is simple to fold up, keeps things tidy."
4,Great value overall,"I bought this to see if we could occupy my daughters while driving more; they're 6 and 3. The 6yr old uses it ALL the time and loves it! The 3yr old hasn't tried it yet. I think it's really a good value overall and pretty good quality. The kids like the pockets to hold art supplies and the way it folds up and has a handle. The only drawback is it could use more cushioning to make it more stable, but it works fine."
5,Exactly what we needed,"I was looking for something for my 6 year old daughter to keep some basic art supplies organized so she'd always have them at hand when she wanted them. This little desk is perfect. It's lightweight, has a padded bottom for balancing her her lap, sturdy elastic straps to hold in a pretty thick pad of paper and zippered two pockets (one on each side) for holding pencils, crayons, etc. The material is some sort of nylon which is relatively easy to wipe off with a damp cloth if it gets dirty.I wish the pockets on the sides were a little deeper, but that's me being too picky :)"
4,Great for a gift,I got this for my niece for Christmas and it has been a great gift. I will be putting it to the test in April when I take her on a 5 horu road trip for her parents. :)
1,Alex Desk To Go,"Not a very good buy, i thought it be used more by my daughter, and she doesnt like it. The red carrying strap ripped right away, just not well made. I cant recommend this."
3,HANDY BUT FLIMSY,"I recently purchased this and was surprised after reading all the great reviews how flimsy and cheap looking this is. It is a handy little desk and lightweight which is great, but it is not sturdy at all. I'm also disappointed that the desk top is simply cardboard covered with a nylon material. This makes the writing area textured, so you will not want a single sheet of paper on the desk...think of writing on paper laying over a textured table cloth. That can be frustrating, especially when using a pencil, or for a child learning to write letters. A wide-tipped marker would do best."
3,Maybe good for a smaller child,"I had bought this for my 6 year old, at the time wavering back and forth about whether or not this would be big enough for him. He's not a big child, and I finally decided it might be enough for him in the car. It did end up a bit too small. The cushion is not thick enough. However, he loves the pockets on the sides where he can keep his markers and it tidies up neatly with the straps so you can take this on the go. Maybe this is better for children 4 and under."
4,Great Disk,"Well ""Everybody Hurts"" is a great song, but you know the 2nd song on here ""Dark Globe"" was written by Syd Barret, the origional lead singer for Pink Floyd. Michael Stipes wanted to sing one of his songs. He has was influenced by him. This CD is worth buying.."
2,Boring!,"First off, Jillian does a _great_ job describing proper positioning and breathing; however, the workout section was so boring that I couln't even finish the session. They all look bored, themselves. No smiling, no apparent energy or passion for what they are doing...just stone cold faces and almost robot-like movement through the few and low-repetition exercizes.I also don't at all like the info-mercial aspect to the Gaiam DVDs...the instructors always seem to recommend some prop to aid in doing some move rather than describing what muscle groups are supposed to be used to help control the motion naturally.This DVD is dull and uninspiring"
2,"boring, but very informative","I'm new to pilates and I wanted to find a dvd that breaks down the moves and that shows me how to do the moves correctly in order to get the full benefits. This dvd does that and give you very helpful information on each movement. This video is very slow, but it has plenty of info on the movements. It plays more like a documentary than a workout video. This dvd breaks downs each movement step by step. There is a woman and man on screen that shows you how to do each movement while the announcer (voice over) tells how to do the movements. Also has a great background, it takes place on what looks like a mountain side (very relaxing)."
1,Bad production,"I'm a newcomer to Pilates, and I admit that the parts of the DVD I viewed, I liked. Unfortunately, the DVD production quality is so bad that about 10 minutes into the mat workout (the really important part of the disc) the DVD hangs. No problem, I thought--I just ordered another one. Believe it or not, it had exactly the same problem in the same place.Both DVDs had small dappled spots on the surface in the same place, which I assume is what was causing the problem. There are several tracks that are completely unwatchable as a result. With quality control like this, I will never buy another Gaiam DVD."
4,Experience,"The book is excellent, I enjoyed reading it and think that you will be excited with the drama it potrays.Great Job Ms. Kristina"
4,Great Reference Book,"There are three books in this series. Volume Two deals with the following topics; Mountebanks among Forensic Scientists, More Mountebanks, Forensic Capillary Gas Chromatography, Forensic Identification of Illicit Drugs, Microscopy and Microchemistry of Physical Evidence, An Introduction to the Forensic Aspects of Textile Fiber Examination, Forensic Mitochondrial DNA Analysis, The Identification of Semen and Other Body Fluids, and Firearms Identification.Dr. Saferstein has done a wonderful job of getting well respected scientists to write each section. These handbooks should be required by any forensic science program."
5,"Works great with Apple 23"" Cinema Display","I just added a 2nd 23"" Cinema Display and wanted to use it in portrait mode. This arm handles the 23"" CD perfectly. When I first attached it it drooped the display, but reading the manual revealed the screw to tighten the tension and all is well again."
3,Poems of 'self',"I really wanted to like this book. It contains a few magic moments, and the poet unquestionably demonstrates agility and skill within these formal works.But overall, the poems were a disappointment. They don't live up to the famous Rabbi Akiba epigraph, ""If I am not for myself, who will be for me?/ If I am only for myself, who am I?/ If not now, when?""It's a risky venture, exposing deeply personal discoveries to the public.Unfortunately the risks taken here never break out of a vapid self-centeredness into the universal language that all poetry seeks and successful poetry attains. Skip it. Alyssa A. Lappen"
3,unicorn,"Overall, I was happy with it. The desciption(story,myth,legend etc...) of the Celtic unicorn was weak. Not much presentation. I had to switch the necklace to a prettier box.But it served it's purpose."
2,Unreliable,"Hard to say -- is it the phone or is it T-Mobile? -- but this phone is just not a reliable communication tool. I've had it for about 5 months now and I use it for phone calls, email, and web surfing. Every now and then it would freeze and would have to be rebooted. Sometimes it can be very slow. Sometimes service disappears and doesn't come back for some time -- while the phone remains in the same place where it was only a moment ago. Sometimes the battery charge doesn't last a day, with only modest use during the day.Granted, most of the time it works fine -- but a communication tool should work all the time."
1,"Jimmy cracked screen, and they don't care!","Had the Dash for a year and a half. Battery began to die after 6 months, standby time was dismal. Thought I was in a bottomless pit of phone pergatory until the dredded ""cracked screen."" OMG, I thought it only happened to others, not me. What was a guy to do? I reverted to my old stand-by, my old pal, the Motorola Razr. It never let me down. As for the Dash, she is buried at the bottom of my sock drawer. Bless the dead and if you buy the Dash, be prepared for a disfunctional relationshp that will come to a complete and utter end when you least expect it. You may try to reboot, but in the end all will fail. So stay clear of this device and read the reviews; find out what really works & make an informed purchase. At the present, I am in the market for a new phone relationship, one based on quality, speed, reliability, and commitment. Farewell, Dash, you were a problem from the start."
3,Not that great,"I really was excited to get this phone but it has really disappointed me. The main things I hate on this phone is that wifi is extremely slow, the alarm goes off all the time even when I do not turn it on and the touch pad volume control sucks! I always accidentally touch the screen when I am on the phone and it messes with the volume. So annoying! The call quality also sucks but I'm not sure if it is the phone or just t-mobile. All in all, I don't hate the phone, I just hate aspects of it but I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Worst PDA phone!,WM 5.O is hard to use. Speaker is very soft; there is no volume control. My unit is broken in 3 month. The battery gets very warm and discharges quickly after a full charge at minimal use.
2,Screen cracked,"At first I liked this phone. But then I got annoyed by that slide bar that changes the volumne. The worst part came only after 7 months or owing it, the screen cracked for no reason. Tmobile won't warrenty that."
4,Great all-around PDA; beware of fragile screen,"I bought this phone when it was originally launched at a reduced cost and my only regret is that I broke the screen with it in my pocket. I was able to talk my way out of the deductible and just paid shipping or I might not be as pleased with my experience.First off, the phone works well. Good volume and reception. I did have some problems with the phone link turning itself off but that disappeared when I updated the operating system.The Windows Mobile Media Player is awesome once you add a MicroSD card and a quality pair of earbuds. The ones included do not stay in my ear (my problem, not the buds) but sound great when I can get them seated correctly.I didn't have any problems syncing it to my computer, Yahoo Email, or my companies Outlook, when my company allowed it.Overall for what I spent and what it has delivered you could do much worse."
1,Do Not Buy This Phone!!!,"This phone sure seemed cool before the LCD cracked on day 5 of owning it. Sitting in my jacket pocket no less. Guess what the manufacturers warranty does not cover? Yep...the LCD. Scheisters!!!... I hope HTC drowns in a polluted puddle in China..and takes the CEO of TMobile with it and that brainless girl with the awful voice from customer service. ""I'm sorry sir, that's too bad we just robbed you of $300.00 :)"" Yea! @#@$ You!!! Scheisters!!! I hope this helps...Happy Holidays!"
3,"Great phone, nice wifi crappy camera","I bought this phone to replace my blackberry 7820 and Razor V3xx. I was constantly switching my sim card from home to work and bought this as an all in one. I love this phone. bluetooth, wifi, voice recorder, windows media player, great reception. BUT crappy camera. Would be great except for that. Razr v3xx is 100 times better camera."
1,really bad phone,"It is a really bad phone. The first year it is ok but always auto-dial even if I lock it. The battery can be used only 12 hr and have to be charged everyday after I use half year. The second year this phone always auto-close when I talk with somebody else by phone. Currently, it is completely down. My god it is not a phone but a black sheep. Never use it if you have important thing to talk."
1,Horrible. DONT buy this phone.,"I absolutely despise this phone. I thought it was great when I first got it, but now that I have had it for a while, I think it's the biggest piece of garbage I have EVER wasted my money on. the phone is SLOOOOOOW. the alarm goes off randomly throughout the day, it takes at least 7 minutes to completely load and function after it's been turned off, and now, my phone won't even turn all the way on.I have never had so many problems with this phone. I even talked to people at T Mobile and they admitted that this is a poor purchase.I am completely dissatisfied with this product. I'd rather have a land line than have this phone."
1,I hate this phone,"I've had problems syncing from day one, both with ActiveSync & the newer windows mobile program. It's problem after problem after problem. Every single time I have to sync is a production. The phone itself is SO SLOW that it's next to useless. It takes forever to process anything. The camera quit working on it for no apparent reason. Unless you buy extra memory for it you can fit almost nothing on it. A couple of extra ring tones and it's full. It's my first smart phone (if you can even call this phone smart) but I have to believe there are far better ones out there."
2,Looks are deceiving,I love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it. From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone I've ever owned. I've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise.
1,phone is mediocre but t-mobile is the worst,"My phone broke after a month or so. After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light, did you put it in the sun, did you drop it, did you put it in your pocket and bend it, did you put it in your pocket and bump into something, did you drop it, did you break it, did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money.The most amusing part of the conversation went like this: would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost $15? When I responded that the ground would be fine she said ""OK, that will be $9.95"". I had to laugh at their arrogance."
4,Extremely fragile screen,"Our company recently switched from Blackberry to the Dash. The Dash is very nice and I like it better than the Blackberry. BUT you have to be quite tender with it so I can't rate it 5 stars. My screen broke after 2 weeks. It was on my belt under my seatbelt and it didn't survive a hard stop (no crash). A VP broke his the first couple days. As has my manager. Today another person on my team sat down at his desk, Dash fell about 18 inches onto the typically hard carpeted cubicle floor. Screen cracked in half. Of the many cell phones I've had over the years, all of them you could drop onto cement with no worries. Not the Dash. You best get one heck of a wty or replacement plan with this fragile smartphone."
2,Very fragile LCD screen!!!,"This is a great phone, however I highly recommend insuring your phone! This can only be done within the first 14 days of purchasing your new phone. Also get a shell protector!!! I didnt do this and I had my phone in my jacket pocket and I took it out and my LCD screen was cracked....the phone was useless at that point."
3,Its Okay...But,"I bought this phone to replace my Blackberry 8700g, from what I read it would give me everything I need that my Blackberry didn't. A camera and games. Well...It does but I should have bought a blackberry that does the same thing. I am so unhappy with this phone that within two weeks of owning it I went out and bought a blackberry curve 8310. This phone is great if you don't put a lot of data on it. I had to buy a memory card so that I could stop getting the message that I was running out of space. But after 10 pictures it still tells me that. This phone is great if you don't plan on using it as a pda, or really using it but for fun. For me, I need a PDA and it just didn't work for me. The picture quality is beautiful and quite surprising that I can get a clear shot while the sun is going down. Other than that I would NOT recomend this phone to anyone. I will stick with my blackberry which seems to have it all."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Do yourself a favor and click on the link above for the author's other books. Note that she has written books on hamsters, koi, gerbils, parrots, and conures.I am truely amazed that the author is an authority on so many different animals. I have been breeding chinchillas for well over five years and I have rarely seen so much inaccurate information in one book."
4,A wonderful source of basic information,"This book provides all of the basics for raising a pet chinchilla. Although it covers a lot of topics, I would have appreciated a lot more details...especially regarding chinchilla health. It is a great book for someone who wants to learn the baiscs of chinchilla care."
4,Chinchillas,This book has a lot of helpful information in it. I would reccommend this to all my family and friends.
3,Xena:Warrior Princess (Xena),"I bought this book for my little cousin, who is a uge fan of Xena. When it arrived he insisted on me reading it to him. Being an avid fan myself I agreed, and I think that this book does an incredible job of telling the story of Xena. It does justice to the series and the trilogy that first introduced us to Xena. He loved it and so did I."
4,XENA strikes again!,"This is a great little book based on actual episodes of the TV show. It's an easy read for the younger set, but also a fun read for us old time Xena fans. The format is a tiny (about 3X4, but thick) hardcover with lots of good pictures in it.It starts out with the bad Xena trying to kill Hercules then progresses on to where she turns good, meets Gab and they become friends and travel together. Classic stuff!"
5,The Johnny Cash American concept albums,"Johnny Cash / Come along and ride this train (eight albums on 4 CDs - Bear Family Records):This Johnny Cash box set from Bear Family Records is very different from the other sets Bear Family has of his work. Instead of having every track and outtake from a particular period, this one gives us eight of Johnny's American concept albums which he made in the 1960's and 70's (without outtakes, etc).The Eight albums included in these 4 CD's are...""Ride This Train"" from 1960""Blood Sweat and Tears"" from 1963""Bitter Tears"" from 1964""Ballads of the True West"" from 1965""Mean As Hell"" from 1966""From Sea to Shining Sea"" from 1968""America: A 200 Year Salute"" from 1972""The Rambler"" from 1977These are not the only American concept albums that Johnny made but these eight fit together wonderfully in this Great box set.The Tracks in this box set are NOT included in the other Johnny Cash box sets from Bear Family."
4,A super collection of Old Johnny,"Once again I've had the pleasure to listen to the Man in Black. I've especially loved the songs dedicated to Indian themes, such as As long as the grass shall grow, Talking Leaves, Hiawatha's Vision. Thank you for your contribute to the Indian cause, Johnny."
3,"OK, but can't reach full power through variable control","I was disappointed that the variable control only produces about 75% power. To reach full power, you must flip the select switch to ""full"". I really need variable power from 0% - 100%."
5,"Clean, fresh and innocent","A great perfume for office or work. Smells like clean,fresh,breezy laundry. Not too overwhelming or offensive.I use it often. It is a scent that does not tire your nostrils or go stale easily."
1,Seriously deficient,I ordered a 10 pack of empty AIT cases and received only 1 AIT case. When I complained you put the order through again and again I only received 1 empty AIT case when I wanted 10. Then you refunded my money but I still do not have the cases that I need. I am very disappointed with the product that I received because it is not what I ordered.
5,The Horse,"Her horse's name is Pacifica, but Amazon doesn't sell it.The horse is dun(very pale gold with a black mane and tail) and is like the other horses, Baha and Topanga."
5,Great doll,"i brought this toy with her horse but,my unit is defective,so i am going back to target today and getting the same doll because this doll is great"
5,Perfect!,"My favorite singer is w-inds.!in Korea, has mny w-inds's fans!I am alsow-inds's fan!this third album is so perfect album i think!especially I like 'Love train'Keita's voice is so cool!If you want to buy some of Japanese artist's album,I reccomended this album!"
3,Great but requires MacGyver adjustment.,"This rail is awesome, but the problem is that the foot pieces don't connect snugly enough with the leg pieces, which means than the whole rail will wobble a bit when you ride on it....which is scary/dangerous.To fix this, I had to drill my own holes through the legs & feet and use a bolt and wing nut to actually SECURE the legs, then I filled the remaining space with something like plummer's goop to eliminate any room to vibrate.If you're willing to do this, you'll transform this into the most kick-ass rail in town."
4,funnier than chris rock; cooler than Miles Davis,"How many albums are wicked funny and massively cool at the same time. This is it, music fans. Skip lunch for a week and get it. Oh and it's funky, too. Greasy enough to close some arteries. Answers the musical question, ""What if Frank Zappa was black?""Funny, funky, cool, toe-tapping, intelligent. What more can you ask for?"
1,Unsatisfied customer,"The Theorema watch that I bought for my wife's 2005 Christmas from Old World Collection, Trias in Germany, was over two months late when I received. On 18 April 2006, approximately three months after receipt, the watch has stopped working."
2,I like it. It was a good purchase,I bought it without reading any reviews. Once I received it I tried to find out what I had bought. The 1st shocking thing I realized was that 90% are negative reviews; the 2nd was that the watch was not accurate at all (a delay of 4 minutes a day!). I sent it to the watchmaker and lucky me it's now less than 1 minute a day fast!The design is very nice. That's was the reason I bought it at 1st glance and that's also the reason for taking the time and make this review.Is the watch worthless? No. Not on my opinion. I am still disappointed that was not originally fine tuned at the factory
3,Fantastic Math Review,"This guide provides a rally good math review section, the English Comprehension section was ok-but left me wanting more. On the actual exam, I had 33 questions and a time limit of 30 minutes. So you have to practice timing yourself on the practice quizzes. I also found the practic quizzes easier than the actual exam, but that's the luck of the draw. (some of it may have been stress related b/c of the time limit)Overall, I would still get this because I would have done horribly without the refreshers."
4,GOOD BOOK,"I wish I had gotten this this book before I bought a steamer, I would have gotten a different one."
2,"If you're someone who likes journeys that don't go anywhere interesting, this should be right up your alley.","If you're the kind of person who likes reading Umberto Eco and watching French films, you might like this. Otherwise, happy slogging. Trying to read & enjoy this book is like trying to play chess blindfolded without anyone telling you the rules - some people can do it, but whether you're one of them is another matter entirely.The first story, Dark Piper, isn't too bad. The second story, Dread Companion, can be read entirely separately from the first, which is actually not a point in its favour. It would be a much better story if its middle 80% was chopped out and the story continued from where it ends."
5,Beautiful,This barbie is so beautiful and entertaining! Both her and princess Anneliese look so beautiful together. They both look great as a decoration peice and great to play with!
3,SON LOVES IT,THIS CD WAS FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVES IT I AM WAITING FOR HIM TO WEAR IT OUT :)...TOOK FOREVER TO GET THOUGH :(
3,Ughhh mainstream is in fashion I guess,"This album makes me feel like only breaking a vase versus there previous albums were I wanted to destroy a whole city. I want the anger back,,,, I need the anger back."
4,A surprising dose of heavy twisted music,Otep is the female version of Marilyn Manson. She has the same perspectives on life as Manson does in most respects. This is my first album by Otep although I know a few people that don't like them. I was suprised to find out this is actually a good cd. The production and sound on it is very good and being a death metal junkie like I have become this was a new and welcomed sound with the same punch I like in metal music. Although I don't agree with the twisted views she portrays this is still a band to pay attention to and was one I didn't waste money on.
5,Otep Rocks!,"Otep gets better and better with great tracks like Crooked Spoons and Ghostflowers. If you love Nu Metal or any metal really, you will love Otep's The Ascension.Raw and Hardcore \m/"
5,the best metal album of the year period.,Otep has always been a step above other metal acts because of the strong lyrics and the vocals of a goddess. this album they set the bar up even higher. when i first put this in the cd player i thought this is the otep that i know and love and then i came to the song 'perfectly flawed' which is different then there other music but beautiful and it showed that they have range and will always surprise there fans. if you've never listened to otep i encourage you to buy any one of there albums. this one i think is there best so far.
1,"Oh, Otep. When are you going to get help with your problems?","What a waste of money. I was told about this band that was fronted by some ""chick"" and was told that she was hardcore. That should of been my warning. Sure enough my fears were correct. Crappy predictable guitars, girly girl topics with a message and vocals that are processed with all sorts of effects because she cant scream by herself. I suppose I am being harsh but I just dont understand what people see in this junk. What angers me more then anything is that she routinely rips off her ""corpse paint"" from Mayhems Maniac. Check out the similarities.Any one who likes quality metal skip this. Get some Origin, Hate Eternal or Immolation."
2,I'll put it real simple..... This b**** needs JESUS!,1st off They screwed up a very good NIRVANA song . They shoud not have done that.Instead of otep I call them OCRAP. whoever abused this chick did a number on her .she is weak.....
2,Not as nice as the photos,"I ordered this set for our everyday and formal use. I was very dissapointed when I received them, as they really looked nothing like the photo. The flatware had some sharp-ish edges, and the hollow spots were dirty. The weight wasnt very substantial and they felt cheap. They are nothing like the stunning Wallace Grand Baroque in Sterling. They should try again. This stainless set is not worth it. AND, it didnt include the box!!"
2,A decent product,"My first impression is that the fit and finish wasn't exactly up to typical Thule standards.Apparently a generic cookie-cutter product with Thule logo slapped on it.However, it will do the job."
5,Bicycle Frame Adapter for Bike Carriers,Excellent product for use to attach woman's bicycles to car bike rack. Product delivered as described.
1,Did not fit bike,"Make sure this items fits your bike. The bike frame was too big to fit in the adapter. I had to connect to seat bottom and handle bars. After first rain, I noticed rust on bar. Walmart has a similar adapter for less."
3,Handle with care!,"The directions on this DVD advise watching the entire program through before trying it yourself. Be sure to do that! The entire routine is frustratingly difficult to follow, even for someone experienced with stretching exercises. The directions are confusing and the pacing highly erratic.For a FAR better overall exercise experience, better paced and better coached, try anything by Rodney Yee. He's the best!"
5,Just what I needed :-),Madeline Lewis is very pleasant to listen to. The background music and setting is very soothing. The routine is just what I needed. My job is quite physical and this helps to reduce muscle soreness at the end of the day.
4,STRETCH DVD,"THIS DVD WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR-GREAT STRETCHES FOR BOTH AM AND PM...NICE MUSIC, NICE SCENERY AND EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTOR AS SHE DOES THE STRETCHES...ANYONE WHO HAS TIGHTNESS IN THE BACK OR IS JUST SIMPLY NOT FLEXIBLE...A GOOD CHOICE"
5,I like the a.m og p.m. stretch,"I like the stretch work out with Madeleine Lewis. I use it after I have done a work out with zumba fitness sculpt and tone, or dance off the inches hip hop party (Jennifer Galardi). Madeleine show the different exercises with a beautiful nature in the back ground. It is easy to follow her instruction. You can see all the exercises the instructor are doing, so you would not lose any of the details of the moves that are being done. I would recommend this video because I think it helps to build up strength and flexibility in the body. I think if you have an arched down in the lower back, this video may help a little bit to strengthen this section. I think also it can be nice just to do as an a.m. and p.m. stretch which the video are made for. Kind regards form Norway"
3,This is not for the novice.,"This is not for the novice. I travel allot and was looking for something that I could do in my hotel room. I just started a stretch routine about two months ago. So I purchased this to supplement to that. I realize that this is beyond my abilities. This is not for the average, moderately overweight, doesn't exercise like they should, individual. The women in this video is highly flexible, to the point of looking like she broke something. So far, I've only attempted to do it about three times. With that thought, I'm the overweight business traveler that doesn't eat right or exercise and these stretches I, physically, can't do. Now, if you're a slim person that exercises on a regular basis then this would work for you."
1,Not for beginners or those with any type of back issues.,"This video is most definitely NOT for beginners. The basics of proper body positioning such as how much of the lumbar or thoracic back should be touching the mat in a relaxed supine position aren't even touched on . And not nearly as much of a warm as it suggests. Also, the morning stretch while is thorough in leg and lower to mid back stretches, it is not nearly enough for upper back or cervical neck especially for those that have any type of desk job. The video itself is nicely produced and great scenery but I prefer to focus on my body more than the t.v. screen other than watching for instruction."
1,More advertising than stretching,"If you want to buy an advertisement for The Gaiam Corporation, this is excellent. There is plenty of advertising but little real exercise. Amazon took it back quickly and easily. I feel badly for anyone who purchased from this company. I won't anymore."
5,Great stretch for sore muscles.,"I am 47, overweight and going through menopause. My muscles hurt all day, every day and this DVD provides me with relief. Madeline Lewis takes you through a slow meaningful stretch routine that leaves you feeling great afterwards. The AM and PM workouts are each about 30mins long, plus there is an extra 30 min routine that is more advanced once you master the AM & PM routines. The stretches are good for ppl of all ages and fitness levels. You stretch as far as you can go comfortably so it doesn't matter how flexible you are. It's for everyone."
3,Too long,"Solid stretching routines, but at 30+ minutes AM and PM segments are just too long. There is just no justification for spending this much time on gentle-paced, easy stretches for anyone who exercises regularly and needs a good stretch after a challenging workout. Just about any beginner's yoga DVD will be much more beneficial than this."
5,I recommend this DVD to everyone,"Since I was 10 years old, I've had problems with chronic headaches. I've seen many neurologists and had spent 20 years looking for relief before I bought this DVD. As soon as I started the AM & PM Stretch, I realized that I have serious muscle tension issues in my neck and back. Now, as long as I do these stretches once or twice a week, I never get headaches. These stretches make me feel great.The PM Stretch is the ultimate stress reliever. After the AM Stretch, I am ready to take on the world. I started doing these stretches 2 years ago and I still do them at least once a week.The events that lead me to buying this DVD: I fell off of a cliff while playing paintball. I dislocated my shoulder. Months later I started having severe pains in my upper back. I saw a chiropractor who recommended I try some stretches. I bought this DVD. No more upper back pain. No more headaches. I feel great!Do yourself a favor and try these stretches."
2,Buyer Beware! Not really stretching,"I really wanted to like this, but felt really misled by the title and packaging. I was looking for a thorough stretching routine I could do after exercising or to work out those morning kinks and stiffness. This isn't it. It's really a pilates/yoga DVD, and as such would get 4-5 stars. But I didn't want pilates or yoga--I don't like pilates, and I've got plenty of yoga DVDs. I give it 1 star as a stretching DVD. Stretches aren't held long, there's a lot of bouncing, the upper body is largely neglected, and I didn't get that nice ""stretched out"" feeling I was looking for.It's fine for what it is--the scenery is pretty and the music is benign. The instructor doesn't seem to know her right from her left, which since all the narration was voice-over, was distracting, but it doesn't matter all that much as far as doing the routines."
3,Fine for beginners or the not so physically active,"This is a well produced and pleasant to watch video. Nice scenery is coupled with relaxing music and voice-over. That being said, I found it to be quite basic and more remedial in its approach than what I had hoped for. If you are searching for gentle routines using very basic yoga-like movements, this may be a good choice for you. However, if you are more physically inclined and able, and are looking for a more serious stretching video, this will probably fall a bit short of expectations."
5,Good Stretching,"I like the streching exercises on this DVD and the fact that it also makes sure to focus on proper form and psoture, it is not just bouncing around type stretching. The focus on the core is good and something I find important to help make sure your back is also getting a workout and development. It has some similarities, in general, with yoga and pilates, or at least it seems that way to me, but is neither of those. Good addition if you do either of those or you just want to stretch in general."
3,Disappointed,Ms. Lewis's exercises were good but pace was too rapid to comfortably follow along. I'd call this a speed stretch!
3,Good for beginners,"This is a well produced and pleasant to watch video. Nice scenery and relaxing music .But I found it too basic and easy. If you are searching for gentle routines , this is a great choice for you. However, if you are looking for a more serious and challenging stretching video, this will probably make you down."
4,Love the setting,"It is actually refreshing to stretch with this video, the music and setting is very relaxing."
3,Meh,"I only tried the PM stretch, but I was so put off by that one, that I haven't been able to try the AM. Did not like the stretches. By the last set, I was feeling nauseated and had to quit. A LOT of leg and calf type stretches. Boring instruction. Just not my thing. Try the Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee. Much better!!!"
4,This book will explain what you don't know about Boltanski,I saw his exhibit in Paris a few years ago and I was intrigued about this artist.This book will give more explanation on his work and why he does it. Some of the writing can be too academic and hard to understand. There's an interview with Boltanski which I loved. He's very opinionated and an interesting artist. There's not much info on him on the internet so I'm really glad that was made.
4,Buy This Book !!!,"A good book on an excellent artist. Why, then, only 8 / 10 ? Because the authors/contributors do not deal in-deep with certain AMBIGUITIES in Boltanski's life and art. Everybody always focusses on the quote >official< unquote biography and bibliography of Boltanski (e.g. in Lessons of Darkness). But CB himself is constantly re-arranging and reconstituting these 'facts'. Critics and curators, though, always seem to take the information for granted.I think that CB plays a game with us, and that (t)his game is a very important part of his oeuvre. As such it should be properly documented and studied.Han Geers"
1,Unable to review,"I'm unable to review the product as I never received it, but I was charged for it! When emailing the seller, I never received a reply. Be careful when purchasing anything from this individual."
3,"Bible Exposition Commentary, Vol. 1: New Testament","Bible Exposition Commentary, Vol. 1: New TestamentOK. a little liberal in its view on divorce-exception clause in Matthewhaven't looked at much else yet"
2,Soup,"As I tend to overdo homemade soup adding all sorts of things I like and ending up with a bland pot, I had hopped to find some rules for making good soup that would cure me of the scattegun approach but this book was just compilation of regular old recipes which will probably never be taken off the shelf."
3,Warning!,"I bought this item a while ago for the list price of $1,999, and let me tell you it was not worth it. Hell, I'm not sure if I'd even pay $1,000 for these 10.2 ounces of product. Maybe $500. We'll just say $499. Anyway, I went through the entire set fairly quickly before discovering that the ""timeless quality"" and ""romantic, floral scent"" do not mix with meatloaf. I thought I was going to be enjoying a flowery and long-lasting meatloaf, what I instead enjoyed was a trip to the Illinois Poison Center. The wait staff were friendly and the doctors were very knowledgable.Overall, I gave this product 3 stars, 1 star for the product itself and 5 stars for the good people at the Illinois Poison Center. It's almost worth eating this product just for an excuse to visit those lovely people again."
1,"""THREE Accurite Rain Gauge Replacement Vial""","As a consumer, the photograph of three (3) vials and ""Three"" as the first word in its description was misleading. Even the description states ""5"" capacity tube comes with 1 replacement tube"". Disappointment was felt when only ONE vial arrived and, also, there was no ""lip"" on it as shown in the picture. A blunt response from the manufacturer when receiving our question of ""only one"" was stated as ""As per item description, the item only inludes 1 tube."" ""Thank you???"" This was our first and will be our last order from this company ""Picnic World Plus""."
5,A Wonderful Work,"This work by Scott Plous should not be taken lightly. Dr. Plous, indeed, reviews the literature, but he also puts the missing pieces to the puzzle together as you try to understand how we got to the point we are today in the Psychology of judgment and decision making. Without this comprehensive review, it is hard to put other books in context. Many books explore specific persuasion principles and the psychological aspects of decision making. The problem is, how to you put all of the pieces together to make sense of it all. Plous gives the big picture so you will have a place from which to view all the other articles and books you read. I read this book four times and tried to pick apart each paragraph to see how it could apply to influencing others. I promise you the pearls are there if read each page with the goal of understanding how it can be applied in the real world. This book was my top 2 of all time!"
3,"Does not answer ""How to make better decisions""","After reading this book, your ability to make better decisions will improve a whopping zero. If you 1)want to learn how to make better decisions 2)like to save money because it is precious 3)never enjoyed that Psych 101 course in college despite upper classmen swearing you into believing you will learn the tricks to get the hottest babes, then do not buy this book. On the other hand, if you were a geek like me and enjoyed the self torture in order to obtain intellectual enlightment, then this book is definitely for you. This book will cites what seems like 2 million case studies to show you that humans cannot make right decisions worth crap. I kept reading this book to find the ""how to"" section on making right decisions, but there was none, making my decision to buy and read this book a wrong one."
5,Scott Plous is a star. This is an inspiring text that had my brain popping.,"I write this from the perspective of a social and market researcher, and thought I was quite aware of many of the nuances and pitfalls that can render our scientific research somewhat open to question. But Scott Plous, with his vivid, lively writing style, his acute logic and well chosen case studies shows what a hell of a minefield it is that we work in. The Psychology of Judgment and Decisionmaking is a rich resource book of human insight that is at once vitally useful (this book has opened me up to new insights and led me to rethink many aspects of research design) and awfully humbling: there's a pair of pie charts on Page 54 that show that whatever questions we may have about margins of error, the way we happen to phrase the question may well have a much larger effect.In total, Plous entertains, he shares wise insights and he challenges the reader. I wish Amazon had room for 6 stars. I'd give this one 7."
3,Not a complete collection,"This album only has 12 tracks and in my opinion I think many songs are left out such as ""Looking for a Love (that's real),"" ""If It Should Rain,"" ""It Should've Been You,"" ""Nobody Else,"" ""All That I Need,"" and ""Movin' On"" This album is too short, I recommend her you get her ""Best Of"" or ""Essential Collection"" instead of this one! This one was a waste to put out. why does she need a third greatest hits album? She's an awesome singer and this collection is so not complete! Don't buy this CD! Buy her Essential Collection instead which has 18 tracks making it a much more complete compilation album!"
2,"Get more for your $$ w/ Japan import ""Best Of""","I would have to strongly agree with the previous review by Corey. The A&M; Collection is a little boring. Anyone who is enough of a Fan to buy this is likely to have these songs on the original discs. Some refreshing remixes would have been nice, or even an unreleased track or two. This CD reminds me of something you would find at the carwash or truckstop.... The liner notes are pretty good but out dated photographs and boring graphics/cover art make it a bargain bin purchase. I do not like the UK ""Essentials"" for the same reasons.*** The Japanese import ""The Best of CECE PENISTON"" has newer photos, a more modern look and a bigger selection of hits and even a few remixes. It was costly but worth the extra $$ if you are a true fan."
5,The best Ce Ce Peniston,"Everything, I knew it would be, I love dance music and this is a perfect mix of both dance and r&b."
4,good collection,"though more tracks are missing this is a good introduction to Ce Ce's music.I always dug Her feel good jams lik Finally,Keep walking,we got our own thang. She had a voice&was always good for my eye sight. i like her still.saw her new movie recently&was feeling Her new Irena Cara Hair. Ce Ce was cool with dance music.She was like a cross between Irena Cara&Jody Watley&a few other folks.good music&good overview of her career."
5,The Best of Ce Ce Peniston,"The product came on a timely basis to my overseas address and was in mint condition. The packaging was excellent.Maybe a little too large for a CD, so bit of a waste. Smaller packages should be developed for small items if possible.Thank you.Steve"
5,This is an AWESOME dollhouse!,"I bought the Savannah dollhouse for my five-year-old granddaughter who lives in another state. She just loves it, and plays with it a lot. The only complaint she had was that it was hard for her to see the top story--it's taller than she is! (Of, course, this will change!).The house is sturdy and well-built. The furniture is wood, hence durable. My son's comment on the phone was ""Oh, Mom, Wow! Wow! Wow!"" Hey, anytime you can impress an engineer that much, it's got to be good!"
2,"Not impressed, poor quality.","Looks good and is a nice design, but materials are questionable, screws too small to really hold it together - very disappointed in the quality from day one. Tired of fixing panels that pop out and the swing that really doesn't work if you put any weight on it.On the plus side the furniture that came with it was pretty good and much better quality than the house! Wouldn't buy again for $[...] nevertheless $[...]. We had it a year and already threw it out. Junk."
4,savanah dollhouse,"Santa was great to our family this year! Our 2 1/2 year old daughter loves the doll house as do we. It is much bigger than her but this allows she and her sibling to play in the house at the same time. A few of the furniture pieces were broken from the arrival but hopefully it will be replaced after I contact the company. I'll write again if they do not! Overall, its a wonderful addition!"
5,Excellent Quality Dollhouse!,"We got this dollhouse for our daughter for Christmas, she had been wanting a Bratz Mansion or a Barbie Dreamhouse, but they looked so cheap and made out of flimsy plastic, and I wanted something that was going to be durable and hold up over years of playtime. I am so glad we went with this instead!! It is crafted so beautifully, and the details are exquisite. The furniture is heavy duty, and the Barbie and Bratz dolls fit it perfectly, which I was a little leery of because the pictures make the house appear to be a smaller scale than Barbies or Bratz, but they fit perfectly. I would definately recommend this house to anyone looking to buy a dollhouse!! We are so glad we did!"
4,Great doll house!,This is a great doll house! I would recommend it for anyone! Easy to assemble. High quality. The only complaint is the porch swing is not much. I am very pleased with my purchase.
5,Very Satisfied,"The dollhouse was a huge hit at Christmas! My 3 year old loves it eventhough she can't even reach the top floor (4 total). It was easy to put together except for the porch swing which required my engineering creativity to keep the swing from flipping over. Other than that, it took less than 30 minutes and is pretty sturdy."
1,Not durable,"We bought this dollhouse for our 5 year old daughter for Christmas. As of tomorrow, it will be in the trash. It is shame because my daughters loved playing with their Barbie dolls with it, but it just fell apart on them. The furniture was nice, but the dollhouse was not durable."
2,disappointing,"This dollhouse is not worth the cost. While it has some positive aspects, it is not durable or well made. After 4 months of use we will be throwing it away and looking for another doll house from a different company.First the positives: it is colorful, big enough for barbies, and my daughter enjoyed playing with it while it lasted.The drawbacks: The wood and floors don't fit together well so that the floors keep falling out. There is really nothing to secure the floors in place besides a slot for them to sit in. Because it is poorly made, the floor doesn't snap into place and falls out whenever any weight is added. Next, the swing doesn't work. Anytime a doll is put in it, it flips over. Not so fun for a 5 year old.The concept is good, but the quality is poor."
3,good but doesn't fit a scooter,i have a yamaha zuma 125 and it didn't fit. its a heavy duty lock just didn't fit my scooter
4,A great book for students,"A Reliable, pragmatic book, great for students and for all those who like to see it clear, with real life examples, great tips and all that is needed to get a good glimps into the hospitality business. Easy to read and nicely organised."
3,Entertaining,"This is my third Silverberg novel. All of them have been entertaining and easy to read. His treatment of an alien culture in this novel is quite realistic and fresh. I gave the 3 stars only because the ending was too much like the New Testament. Why develop a storyline that does such a remarkable job of complete originality, then end it like the Bible?"
4,Good book,"This is a huge book with lots of information. I liked the presentation and the author knows what he is talking about on a very large subject.My only complaint is that I wish the author had written more from a tips and tricks style, or added a section like that."
4,New to SQL 2K....,I bought this book as a companion to my exam prep reading for Microsoft's SQL Admin exam. I only had 6 months of working with SQL2K when I started to read and study. This book gave great clarification on otherwise vague material. The detail was easy to understand on all levels. I have now been working with SQL 2K for 2 years and still go to my survival guide for reference daily. Also- it's on it's 2nd edition- How many tech books last long enough to go to a 2nd edition?!
4,Good for Beginers,I read a lot on SQL Forum about this book. I am new to SQL Server 2000. So i took a chance to buy and put some of my energy into it. I am still in process of reading this book. But what i have learnt upto this point is really a big help in understanding what is SQL Server 2000 and its administration capabilities.Have a good luck !!
4,Microsoft SQL Server 2000 DBA Survival Guide,"Seller was great. Price, shipping, delivery all outstanding.Book is very easy to read, covers quite a lot and great examples.Older edition of SQL Server (2000). Would not recommend buying this, get the 2005 version since SQL Server 2000 is no longer supported by Microsoft."
5,Great Book - a bit of everything,Used it to study for the exam (70-229). Wish it had a little more on installation options and directions - but great reference. Great overview of everything. May not be ideal for hardcore in-depth stuff. Definitely would suggest it!
1,I still hgave not got the book yet.,I still have not get the book yet. Please let me know how to get it.
4,Wes is great.,"I'm a big John Wesley Harding fan. In 1990 I heard Wes as a bright star on an otherwise ordinary sounding Sire Records sampler called ""Just Say Da"". One listen and I was off to the record store once again.Most of his studio albums have been worthy efforts; ""Why We Fight"" being my favorite of the lot. ""It Happened One Night"" is a wonderful solo acoustic CD with an enduring cafe folk sound.J.W.H. is up there with Elvis Costello in my book for turning a musical literary phrase. In ""Awake"" he's in good form. I can't wait for more."
2,He's capable of much more.,"I've a huge JWH fan since first seeing him in 1990 -- I own all his recordings, and his second (and so far best) album, ""The Name Above The Title,"" is on constant rotation in my CD player. I know I can usually depend on him for marvelously tuneful, edgy, clever songs. But this album is a disappointment -- tame, mannered, and overall unremarkable, with only rare flashes (""Window Seat,"" ""Miss Fortune"") of the deft melodies and dazzling wordplay of the past. Wes, this album just doesn't do you justice."
3,Save Money - or - Buy Quality!,"I purchased this cross slide vise by Shop Fox for use on my Ridgid drill press. The vise is fine for holding a piece to simply drill a hole. You are assured the hole is vertical and straight. However, if you want to drill a series of holes in line by using the cross slide travel, I find the holes will not be in line when I finish.The reason for this is the vise portion is not at a perfect 90 degrees to the transverse travel portion. Worse yet, there is no adjustment to correct the vise to a perpendicular position.I also wanted to use the vise to make slots and mortises by using a center cutting end mill in the drill press. However, with the vise not being perpendicular, the slot will be out of line by almost a 1/16"" after about 8"" of travel.My opinion is if you only want to drill a hole or two, this is a good economical vise. If you want quality and precision, spend the money to buy a really good cross slide vise."
1,Shop Fox D2731 VISE,"Terrible! Poor workmanship. The jaws would not close together leaving a gap of 1/8"" and no way to adjust. Saw similar review before I purchased but thought it was one of those ""that couldn't happen to me"" but it did. I sent it back for a full refund. Look for another manufacturer but NOT Shop Fox. I wouldn't even give it one star. Amazon was great in taking it back and giving me a full refund."
1,dissapointing soundtrack,"A disappointing soundtrack. Not as good as Curtis Mayfield's Superfly, Issac Hayes ""Shaft,"" or Roy Ayers ""Coffy."""
4,Good but sometimes seemed deliberately obscure!,"I read the whole of Sebastian Gardner's 'Guidebook' to Kant and understood most of it. On the whole I would recommend this as making Kant more accessible. But I think he could have made the subject easier by avoiding the use of some words and phrases to seemingly impress the reader and the frequent use of parenthesis (the latter like Kant himself)For example...(page 311)""There must therefore be - if morality is not to be a chimera - some principle of action which is a priori and constrains all rational agents irrespective of their contingent empirical constitution"" (page 311)Avoing the use of the split infinitive and ""therefore"" both of which are unnecessary and do not improve the meaning I think the above could have been better expressed as follows...""If morality is not to be a chimera there must be some a priori principle of action which constrains all rational agents irrespective of their circumstances (or character perhaps)"""
5,spanish dictionaries,"For the English speaker wanting a monolingual dictionary for translation purposes, to find out present day usage, this dictionary is very helpful. I t seems comprehensive,providing 20th cent examples, from an array of authors, of a huge range of words with very nice distinctions. For many purposes it is to be preferred for example to the RAE dictionary, which however records a vast number of archaic uses.I bought it as an adjunct to my other dictionaries (RAE, Maria Moliner and bilingual ones), but have found it to be my preferred source. It is,however, peninsular Spanish."
1,This does not work!,"This charger does not work with my Ipod Nano. I have even tried different usb cables and leaving it charging for hours. No result. Nice price, but it doesn't work."
2,Did not work with our Creative MP3 players,"I purchased this product to charge our Creative ZEN Micro and ZEN V Plus MP3 players, but this product did not work for them or any other MP3-powered devices we have. I suspect it might not have the required ""oomph"" to charge these notoriously hard-to-charge (but otherwise excellent) players. Make sure your product is supported by this product before buying."
1,Don't Bother Unless You Really Want To Play A Hippie....,"A great disappointment. While the organization of information is greatly improved, the tradition itself has been turned into a Mage version of the Children Of Gaia. The interesting sub groups have all been termed ""Extinct"" or ""Dying"", and the focus is now on the neo-hippie ""Joybringers"", severely limiting the tradition. I regret buying this book, and intend to give it to someone who has the old book, and can actually pull something out of it. Don't waste your money. It also ties in with the new WW metaplot, further destroying creativity."
2,Should have written a new book,"When I got the book, I had a problem getting over the shoddy appearance, but I thought, well it's the content which counts. Starting to read it I really struggle with the sloppy way the whole book is made. It is a revision of an existing book, but that is no excuse that one notices each and every time when sentences were added, it's just not round.Maybe everything she tells is true, but I can't get over this patchwork. She should have written a completely new book instead.I recommend Schnarch Intimacy & desire instead. It is far better and there is more hard work behind it."
3,Found Only One Chapter Useful,"Kind of an odd book. Very ""you are the victim"" and ""all children of alcoholics fall into the same category"". Didn't really help me to understand my significant other's behavior. To be honest, kind of felt like it was a waste of money, and most likely could have read most of the info on line for free. Gave VERY LONG ""examples"" or case studies of situations that were just boring, since everyone's situation is unique. Short case studies would have been just as effective. Think I'll just hop on line and see what I can find out for free."
1,Trash,"The seller of this print managed to get rid of my previous review, but I'm sure it's the same old trash. First of all, this appears to be a print of a preliminary sketch or early version by Manet. Having seen the real painting in the Orsay, I can tell you that it is not the real Dejeuner sur l'Herbe. Second, the poster has a large white border that reduces the actual picture to about 10""x8"". Look elsewhere if you want a print."
1,Torturously boring,"I love, love love weird, far-out music from Beefheart to Zorn to Reich to Stravinsky . . . but I hate this. HATE it. Go turn on your radio. Put it on AM. Now take the station dial and start running it around aimlessly, randomly. Do you like that sound? Would you rather listen to that sound than something - anything - that sounds like it was ""written"" for consumption by human beings?? If so - this album is for you. You see, this exercise approximates what listening to 1930 is like for the 99.7% of us who are not impressed with what is ultimately a collage of static."
4,listen to it drunk and high,"listen to this drunk and high and you will initially laugh and say ""my god, it sounds like noise/anarchy/christ has just died and is in the process of being resurrected"".after awhile, you'll say, ""my god! ive never heard anything quite like it!""then you'll give it four stars like i did."
1,GOOD OLD MERZBOW,Still playing music that would scare animals. This is not art. Its noise nothing more :(
1,Ha! Ha! Ha!,"I find it fascinating that today anyone can become an artist, and that anything can be considered art! But don't fool yourself, there are standards, even when you make noise, and I heard way better noise at 'Baustelle' than on these samples (of course I am not giving a cent of my money for this piece of utter s**t). There are people who will probably call this visionary, but there are over 6 billion people out there, and anything you make, and I mean anything will get you approval and money from some of them. So how can you make yourself heard if you are talentless? Connections, my son, connections!"
5,Beautiful serving tray,We got this serving tray for our wedding. It looks wonderful. We haven't had a chance to use it yet but it is large enough to accommodate any treats we would be serving guests and looks great. I like to fact that you can take some the serving dishes out or leave them in. The dishes and the tray both look very nice so apart or together this is a good package.
4,Victorian Fashions Review,"I love this coloring book! Mr Tierney has excellent attention to detail that sets his work apart. My only issue with his drawings is the fact that 90% of the drawings have their hair already colored by the artist using black ink. I prefer to to add a variety of hair coloring. I own several coloring books using Mr Tierney's work and virtually all have black hair. The styles, however, are perfection!The gowns are exquisitely detailed, there are also men in period dress to color! These are all so much fun to color and I have passed many hours completing them. The pages in this book ail not disappoint!"
4,Captivated,"My wife can hardly lay her coloring books down. She has this one on Victoreian fashions and several others, and I am sure she will be ordering more when these are completed."
4,Bit hastily illustrated Victorian Fashions,"This book contains 45 fashion illustrations from 1837 to 1877. Lots of ladies' evening wear, walking costumes, 10 outfits for children and even some dogs are included among many other.Some of the illustrations are really well done and detailed. However, many of them feels little bit too quickly drawn. Almost every fashion outfit has also some backround - like seashore, garden or room. I agree with the reviewer who thought this book would be better without. Many of these backrounds are really hastily made and actually make whole illustration to look quite chaotic.However, if you are into this period and you like coloring, I guess you would enjoy this book. It offers nice acitivity for hours."
2,"This product was described as ''Any 4 Bb Carburettor to Any 4 Bb Manifold''. The fact is, this is not the case.","The adapter plate will only fit a Quadrajet to a Squarebore manifold, or a Squarebore carb to a Quadrajet manifold (I hope).It will NOT fit a Squarebore Carb (Edelbrock and the like) to a Motorcraft Spreadbore manifold and vice versa.If one tries this a big gap will remain.I do find the way my re-embursement claim was handled, very good. (I will get all my money back)I will gladly send the adapter plate back to the vendor, if they appriciate that. Please tell me if the vendor provides a postage paid code or similar.Best regards."
2,Wasted talent,"Johnny performed in Baltimore with his release of 'The Shape I'm In' and literally tore up the audience. He started out like a bull, but RCA soon forgot or didn't want to create compitition with the reigning Elvis, so his record wasn't promoted as vigorously. Then came the release of his album, and I must say; I'm a big fan of Johnny's, but that had to be the worst compilation of songs ever put on an album. Nothing came close to his intro song for RCA. Unfortunately, its collectible, but not listenable."
5,absolutely beautiful,I love it! I never get tired of listening to it.You discover new aounds each time.Very elegant
1,piece of junk,"This looked like a caliper coated with brass, and pieces of brass being chipped or about to fall off near every edge or mark. It zeroed at around -0.2mm. I sent it back for a refund.I would not recommend to anyone."
2,"Low cost, low quality","These deliver appropriate quality for the price. However, the quality is just not what I'd hoped for. They seem like an inexpensive knockoff. I bought two, and they differed in defects. On one the slide and head joint had been crudely swedged to fit. On the other the press fit was all that was evident. On one the jaws didn't close on zero. On the other they did. Etc. Etc.I guess I was spoiled by an older set of Dixon brass calipers I'd been given. I finally found what I was looking for at Otto Frei. I got a 60 mm and and 80 mm capacity set of calipers from them, and they're what I'd hoped for, and only (roughly) twice as expensive."
5,I passed with it,"I used Wiley as a supplement with another online program. I decided to buy it and use it for final review a few weeks before my exam just to make sure I had everything covered. Turns out I hadn't been adequately prepared with the online program alone.Whether or not this book can stand on its own for your CPA review prep depends on your circumstances. I earned my accounting degree over 10 years ago, so this book served me well in my final review prep; but I don't think I could have passed with this book alone.However, if you're fresh out of college, this book might be all you need.In the end, I passed with help from this book. That's good enough for 5 stars."
4,Mongo At His Best,"This, I believe is one of Mongo's best recordings. Excellent sound engineering for its time."
5,The Velvet Sound of Fred Haas,"If you haven't heard of Fred Haas, you need to buy this CD, as well as his latest release, ""Telling Stories."" You will love his original compositions and the velvet sound of this talented musician."
3,A Book for the Professional Baker,"I recently bought this book,after reading several reviews about it and decided to give it a try.For my surprise is a 600 page book with barely no pictures,Its a book for professionals,I am a mom trying to make a nice cake for my son's b-day.If you are NOT a Professional Baker with LOTS of experience DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.The book is a beautiful example of the french methods ,but at times you can't even find the ingredients to make the recipes here in the US.Be aware!!!"
4,The Art of The Cake,The pages are dull except the pictures. They need to be improved in term of the way they are written orf formatted.
5,Best Hula Costume out there,My five year old daughter loves this costume. It is made very well and the price is very reasonable. I recommend it highly.
5,love it!,"i had already fallen in love with bare minerals, but the product was exactly as reported and in perfect condition. shipping was great! thanks!!"
1,The mineral veil doesnt do anytihng. o__O,"I decided to try bare minerals a few months ago, and bought the beginner set since it came with the brushes.Bare minerals are okay, but not very natural looking...you end up looking orange at the end of the day.But anywho, for this mineral veil thing, I put it on, but nothing happens...It does nothing.About me: Pale, just turned 21 couple weeks ago, acne-prone skin, pores, green undertone."
5,"Product great, but buyer beware...","Not a single qualm about the product, but if some of these deals on Amazon seem too good to be true, there's reason to practice caution. I purchased this after reading the fine print carefully. No mention was made about the size, but since it was ""reduced"" from $18 retail (full size price), I ordered it. Alas, what arrived was .14 oz small travel size Mineral Veil. I was disappointed, but learned my lesson: be very careful with some of these prices and sellers. Won't be fooled again."
2,Not what it seems!,Not what was pictured. I'm not even sure it is really made by bare minerals. Makes skin appear very chalky. Seems like a bad knock off. I could be wrong though it could just be very old.
1,BEWARE,"I paid about $100 and got the whole starter kit plus some Buxom lip gloss (which is awesome) and some Eye Rev-ver Upper. This make-up is garbage (the gloss being the exception.) After less than a week of use, my skin was covered with tiny pimples (some of which turned cystic.) I resumed my usual skin care regimen and went back to my old make-up. It's been about two weeks since I used Bare Minerals and my skin is still horrible. I have pimples in places I have never had pimples in my life (and I used to have acne.) I have tiny pimples under my eyes and all over my upper lip and jaw line. Unbelievable. Total waste of money. I'm actually going to have to purchase products to counteract the effects this has had on my skin."
3,definitely messy,"It's definitely messy! Or I just don't know what I'm doing.... If your skin is even a little dry, this looks pretty bad--highlights the baby hairs on your face. From a distance it looks great though. I won't be using it everyday, but it'll work."
4,"Great product, just less of it","I love Bare Essentuals - it's a great product. The only thing I don't like is that now the same product in the same container costs the same, but you get 1.5 grams less. Sneaky way to raise the price."
1,Disappointing,"I was originally spurred to order this album due to a magazine review that acclaimed the work as refreshing. Sorry to say I was greatly disappointed with both the lyrics, the music, and the performance."
4,Smooth as a snifter of brandy,"This record marks a return to form for the fannies, whose last record, Howdy, was a little disappointing. Man-Made is a quality effort that is more subversive than any of their previous efforts- the wonderful harmonies are still there, but there is an underlying maturity throughout the record that sets it apart as a new direction for a band that was in danger of becoming stale.The increased songwriting participation of guitarist Ray McGinley is probably the major factor in this. His songs have always been the most layered of all the band's catalogue, and on this record he really shines.Having seen them live recently, I must say that they are still one of the best indie bands going around, and while they are not part of the british angular rock revival movement, you can bet that all of the hot bands right now owe a massive debt to this great band."
2,Laking Energy,"After the lackluster ""Howdy!"" and the terrible collaboration with Jed Fair, I was hoping for a return to the energetic sound that has made TFC one of my favorite bands. ""Man-Made"" was quite a disappointment.While the vocal harmonies and musical arrangements are beautiful, there is just no passion here, it's like the band is totally bored with the material. When ""Songs from Northern Britian"" was released, I was surprised by how the band had matured and became less hyper-frenetic, but at least that album had some soul behind the performance. If you're new to TFC, I'd suggest ""Northern Britian"" or any of their Geffen albums over this."
2,SQ problem flaws this otherwise fine remaster,"This commentary refers specifically to the Friday Music remaster FRM 7510Prospective purchasers should know that the first couple of seconds of track 4 ""Song of Scheherazade"" exhibit audible ""judder"" (for lack of a better adjective). This was found on two separate copies, including a replacement provided by Friday Music. This artifact was audible on multiple playback systems and does not exist on other CD editions, of which I have several. The remainder of the album sounds fine."
5,BEGIN,"I would buy this album just for Annie Haslam's last note on the disc.It is one of those rare moments that sends shivers down the spine. For a disc that's hard to fault the only gripe I always had and have is that it is too short. It seems to be over before it began..But for those who wish to discover Renaissance, start here and enjoy."
3,"Great sections, decent whole","Pretty, partially pedestrian progressive can get lost up its own period-piece perspective, but nonetheless comes equipped with several thrilling segments."
4,Not Rimsky-Korsakov's,"I love Renaissance and I love this album. However, it has absolutely NOTHING to do with Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, despite what Amazon says in it's blurb.Amazon really should not allow its ignorance of music to show, particularly on a music site! They should hire only informed people to review albums. The blurb trumpeting Renaissance's ""interpretation of Rimsky-Korsakov"" is frankly embarrassing to read.RM's Scherazade is one of my favorite musical pieces and it shouldn't be confused with this album, no matter how good it is.By the way, Rimsky's is far better. I'm not knocking Renaissance. It just is! I think Mick Dunford would agree. His music sounds heavily influenced by Russian composers."
3,I don't understand the fuss,"It's a fine thing, having this album, but I think mostly because of ""A Trip to the Fair"" and perhaps ""Ocean Gypsy."" The epic title work of 24 minutes leaves me wondering if I'll ever be able to ""appreciate"" it. And this from someone who always starts at the hardest albums by prog bands -- and ends up favoring them above all else. So I think they were impressed by their efforts to date and missed the mark on this one. They deserve to, and maybe it'll grow on me, but I've heard it now about 20 times w/o the main piece growing on me. The first track (""A Trip"") is the best!"
3,Nostalgic,"I had enjoyed this in college many moons ago and while there is nothing wrong with this CD per se, musically I have moved on, although I do appreciate the artistry of Renaissance."
2,Not worth it.,"""Momma says if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all."" So, I'm going to try to stick by that old saying and keep this brief.The tutorials are no more than rehashes of what is in the Rhino manual already. The book does not go into much detail with respect to advance techniques.For what it's worth - save your money and buy the Rhino Training Manual, or just about anything else."
1,Glad it's out of print,"This book is nothing more than a rip off.I am a moderate to advanced user of Rhino and I've found that the users manual acompanying Rhino is more than sufficient for a beginner, but lacks real substance on advanced techinque.Thats where this book should come in, however it does not. This is a bad copy of what already came with Rhino.Save your time and money for the better guides on their way."
3,Just for beginners,"This book is just for begginners or Beta users of Rhinoceros 3D program. Tutorials are too much easy to do and some tutorials are the same of the Program manual. Yes , it's well written but i'd prefer some tutorials more interesting."
4,Mae looks younger and slimmer than in her 1930's movies.,Mae looks and dances the Rumba (even showcasing a little Xavier Cugat). She is excellent and beautiful. Unfortunately the non-Mae West 'musical numbers' - especially the victory garden music number should have been cut. They make the picture drag. When Mae is on she sparkles and there is never a dull moment. Just when she starts getting really hot doing the Copa Cabana number the movie ends.... leaving you wanting more of Mae...
4,"great brush, though my preferenc is stiffer bristles","My girlfriend insists on using my hairbrush, one that I've owned & loved for 15 or 20 years; she has loooong hair, so every time she uses it I have to spend 20 minutes cleaning it.Got tired of telling her to buy her own, & bought this one. It looks just like my old brush, but the bristles are significantly softer; I don't get quite the same scalp stimulation, but my hair gets brushed well enough. I'd give this one to my gf and keep my old brush, but these bristles really won't stand up to her hair."
4,Love this Brush!,"This brush is great! My hair is really short, but this brush still works, the bristles feel great on the scalp and it is the perfect size."
4,enjoyed it,did not expect what happened in the movie enjoyed it...i am glad to see that they made a movie that this happen to a man
2,This stunk.,"I watched about fifteen minutes before I gave up. I mean, David Boreanz is always pretty, but what a horrifically boring movie..."
3,It has some moments,"This movie has a few funny moments, particularly the scenes with the kids. However, I felt like I'd seen this movie before because it's so full of romantic comedy cliches. The end has a funny twist, but the rest of the movie seems way too deja vu."
5,Romantic and funny!,"I loved this movie. David is so funny and romantic in this movie! If you want fluff and you want to see David being so romantic, go ahead and buy this movie!"
2,Has cute moments - stress moments,"I rented this mainly because I am a David Boreanaz fan. The film is a long lost cousin of ""Hitch"" and is rather contrived. But romantic comedies are contrived - nothing new here. I enjoyed watching David Boreanaz smile - his other roles are always so serious - I very rarely seen him smile. Besides - he is easy on the eyes. Not all movies are a home run - I realize that. Anyhow, this film had some redeeming moments. This film is a very high-end Lifetime movie. As another reviewer stated - watch this movie only if you are a David B. fan. The female lead, Alana De La Garza, is the new lawyer on ""Law and Order"" and played the girlfriend of Horatio on ""CSI - Miami"""
4,Very Funny,"Well played, this movie is very refreshing as it doesn't take itself too seriously. If you want to have a good time, smile and laugh, then it's a good choice."
1,Worst thing I have seen in a long time,"I never write reviews but I just had to warn people how terrible this is. It's just awful, I barely stopped cringing the whole time. I have no idea why David Boreanaz did this movie, cos he's actually a pretty good actor...in other things."
3,Little slow but cute,"I watched this movie only because David Boreanaz was in it. I've loved him since Buffy & eventually Angel.He's not known for his acting skills beyond a TV series and at times during this movie; I can see why.I almost turned it off but figured, it wasn't a long one and it was kind of a knockoff of ""Hitch"" but with a twist.In the end, I must say I would buy this movie.The scene where he takes her on their dream day and makes her fall for him.. I felt *I* was falling for him (Bad I know).but in end, the story is about love and being able to open up enough to find love.As long as you're not expecting an Oscar performance, you'll be fine."
1,"Wrong battery, twice","The part came wrong, and the replacement was wrong.Please stop selling wrong product and waste people's time. I am still waiting for my refund."
3,Pretty Good,"Not to bad, my son enjoyed this book. He did figure out the ending before we even read it, and I hate when you can do that. Other then that he really did seem to like it for how shot i was."
5,Best book I ever read,It was fun because it was adventurous and we found out who the m person is! It was really great!
2,Poor show for someone aiming to teach English reading.,"My son really enjoys these stories but it is rather disappointing and indeed, shocking to have to point out to him that the word 'and' is a conjunction that joins two sentences to form a longer sentence and that it therefore should have NO punctuation marks before it and should NEVER begin with a capital letter. As I say, the stories are fine but a proof reader or editor is failing to spot glaring grammatical errors here."
3,Children's Book,This is a great children's book. I work with high needs special education students and they were very engaged by the story and accessibility of the writing. It is very engaging and has great word choice that is not too hard but challenging and easy for students to use context clues.
4,pirates past noon,Pirates past noon is about a girl and a boy that go to. Pirate time to heip the M person. A pirate was in thier way. He take thier coin. They had to get it back and go home to save the M person.I think you should raed it.
4,Time of the Pirates,"Pirates Past NoonMary Pope OsborneWould you ever want to travel to the time of the pirates?This is a story about two kids Annie and Jack. They have found a magic tree house and travel to the time of the pirates. The pirates show up and capture them. The pirates make them tell were the buried treasure is. They tell them they don't know were it is, but then Jack & Annie find the treasure and tell them were it is. The pirates found it too and leave to get some shovels and in that time something happens to Annie and Jack, but you'll have to read the book to find out what happens to the two of them.I thought this was a great book think it is for people who like adventure books.I recommend this book to kids 6-10 years old and I think kids would love it if they like adventure."
3,Pirates past noon,"Pirates Past Noon (Magic Tree House, No. 4)Summary:It's a rainy day and Jack and Annie go to the tree house and see a book that has a picture of a sailboat, a parrot and a palm tree. They head on an adventure to an Island..............Review:I thought the book was quite interesting and wished it went on longer. It was exciting to hear about them getting captured and being brought onto the ship.I was disappointed that they never opened the treasure chest and left us at the end of story without telling us everything I wanted to know.I would recommend it for second and third grade boys and girls. The words are easy to read except for one."
3,Quality issue,Issues: The box will not close properly. It arrived with the wooden box warped so much it will not close and latch. The carving set itself is OK. It's a bit over priced for what you get.
2,It's soap.,But it's an odd kinda soap that smells ok...but does nothing for dry skin or itchy spots. Out of the 4 of us who used it not one of us wanted to buy it again.
1,wasn't what I expect.,"I read all those good reviews and I decided to give it a try, this an overpriced soap with the same results as Ivory soap, I don't feel any difference on my skin it didn't leave it as moisturized as I thought, is thousand times much better Olay bar soap Sheer moisture with tangerine oil it smells like the most expensive perfume, my skin smells and feels divine and my shower smells the same after I take a shower and for only a fraction of the price of that french soap. If you want an expensive soap with only a bunch of dried flowers in it, then buy it. I won't buy it again period."
3,um...just a good-smelling soap to me...,"well.... I see most people like it for its scent, truly it does smell great, but for a facial cleanser I thought that's not quite enough...+: good smellhuge sizequte shapecleans well-:doesn't leave skin moisturizedno other effect to skin, just clean upa bit dry"
4,Liked it,"It smells really good and isn't harsh on my skin. I tried the lemongrass kind because of a few other reviews I read. It surprised me, mostly because lemongrass scented things tend to smell a bit funky to me, but this soap smells really nice."
2,"Huge Block of Soap, Crumbled :-(","I bought two of these soaps, the verbena (which smells lovely) & the orange one (nothin special...). I had resigned myself to using one as a mantel splash of color but tonight I read the reviews and one said they are easy to cut. So here I am with a huge knife in the kitchen and left with one misshapen hunk o f crumbly soap. It is horrible soap. Although I recommend the chunk of verbena in a car if one lives in a desert community, the heat makes the car smell great!! Don't buy these expecting to use them in the tub."
5,Great soap!,"This soap is fantastic in quality! And the fragrance is very strong (which is a good thing)! 300g is a very sizable block of soap, too, it will last for quite a long time."
3,average to good Americana romance...,"This romance is unusual because it begins ten years after the hero and heroine break up after a tragedy befalls the heroines brother-and she blames the hero for his death. She moves back to the small town, to take the place of her father-the city's doctor. A accident happens-this romance turns into a semi mystery.Some sensuality, but quite formulaic in the lovers ""battle"" to not fall in love again. I'd say this romance was better than average but not much. There's nothing that makes it stand out from similar books. I would give it an award for a beautiful cover but horrible title. I'd say buy if you can get it used, otherwise skip it. 3.5 stars."
4,Good product,"I bought this item with Buy.com. The service was good in general even when I had some problems with my credit card. I think more info about the status of the shipping is needed. Good product, at right price. I would buy again with them."
1,THIS IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK????????,"With the amount of animosity, hurt, regret and anger that is involved in a divorce situation I find it hard to believe that someone published this book. The hurt that any five year old would feel at her father's stupidity is bad enough, but to write a book about it? This is PAS at its best.Yes, the father should be ashamed of himself (I am going to assume this was based on a true story), but so should whoever told her daughter that her father didn't want her anymore. In the real experiences of many fathers it is the mother who refuses to ALLOW the father to have a relationship with his children - not the other way around.In divorce there is enough blame to go around, the object of our society should be to protect the children from the ugliness portrayed by adults, not add to it."
3,"Beautiful, but....","Doubt if you would have any more reviews from South Africa, since I got this as a gift from New York. The music is beautiful and inspiring, I just find it a pity that it is not really the complete and full soundtrack of ""The Songcatcher"". I like to listen to a soundtrack of a movie and recall the actual ""event"" in the movie, but with the ""modern"" voices inbetween this was not possible. Still, it is a good buy. The other movies/soundtracks that you refer to ""Oh, Brother where.."" has not reached SA yet."
1,O Soundtrack Where Art Thou?,"Like many other reviewers, I loved the music from the movie and thought this was the soundtrack. Instead main stream voices (Dolly Parton, Emmylou, Roseanne Cash..) and cookie cutter music were used to destroy everthing that I liked about the songs from the movie. This CD is probably not so bad if you haven't seen the movie. If you have it's a terrible letdown except for the few songs that remained intact."
3,an actual soundtrack would have been better,"Overall I have to agree with the reviewers who were expecting the soundtrack rather than music ""inspired"" by the film. I'd say about half the tracks on this album are real keepers. The other half are just so-so. I am a big fan of Emmylou Harris, so I am disappointed by her overproduced take on Barbara Allen. I would have preferred more Emmy Rossum."
2,"Not the soundtrack, for sure...","After seeing the movie, I hoped to buy a soundtrack recording. Although advertised as (Soundtrack), read the title of the CD carefully: songs ""inspired"" by the movie comprise most of the tracks. Only a few are actually played the way they were in the movie. A ""nice"" CD, but not at all what I was looking for."
1,just doesn't cut it.,"i only give one star to this cd for one very important reason: the cd is missing that gorgeous song sung by aiden quinn about the two women of the mountain that takes place after the fire. whether it was quinn or someone else, it should have been included. there just seems to have been to many cooks in the kitchen when putting this together. to short, incomplete selection, and dull modern renditions. harris has enough recordings and her barbara allen was plain and disappointing. do some legwork and purchase original recordings."
3,Good soundtrack & other songs.,"I loved the movie, so I was happy to find the soundtrack on CD. There are a couple of good songs by Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton. Good overall."
4,I like it but there are songs left out of this cd that I was looking forward to.,"I like this soundtrack. Not super keen on the instrumental scores from the movie but they are nice. I normally skip over those but while cooking or doing house work, I really enjoy it.Was hoping to hear more of the songs from the movie but maybe I can find them elsewhere."
1,Disappointed,"I should have paid more attention to the fine print. Mostly, this is not a soundtrack album. If I want to listen to all the songs as they are performed in the film, it seems I will have to get the DVD.If you want to listen to the soundtrack performances of all the songs, then do not get this CD."
3,I wanted more of the actual songs of the movie!,"I have to say this is a terrific cd and I love Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. I was disappointed that the song done by the actor who played Tom was not included. It was as if they decided to go with commercial country singers instead of putting in enough of the actual music in the movie. I have to warn you, if you really LOVE the traditional mountain music, you will be happier with Songcatcher Two. I bought them both. And WHY did they not include Emmy Rossum doing the ENTIRE song of ""Barbara Allen"" instead of just a couple of verses? This is my reasons for not giving a four star review."
3,It may serve a purpose,"The disc is a dissapointment if you are looking for a presentation of traditional music without the studio influence. You have Iris DeMent with a very, very fine performance of Pretty Saro but there isn't much of note after that. Sorry, a female voice trying to perform Moonshiner is going to come up short. You are taking on Roscoe Holcomb and the singer doesn't even seem to be aware of the definitive version. However, this may be the route that is necessary to ease people into traditional music. There is an audience out there and for most this is a pleasant enough disc that may generate interest in the masters."
2,Letdown!,"This cd in no way captures the spirit of the Appalachians. I was disappointed because most of the songs are performed by known country artists. I was expecting some primitive, bluegrass, or old time music. I received something commercial."
2,Disappointing,"As I am one of the descendants of the mountain people of NC, I was thrilled when I saw the movie the songcatcher and thought it a great movie!! I asked my children for the soundtrack for Christmas and was thrilled when I opened it. BUT I was disappointed when I played it. The music isn't the original music from the movie, it has been changed tramendously! It sounds like it has been mixed in a studio. Some of the songs were never even in the movie and over half the songs from the movie were left out, then to take up space the scores were added as suite 1 & 2. This is hardly what I would have expected from the sound track of such a great movie with such wonderful mountain ballads of my ancestors. Luckily I live less than an hour from Asheville and can drive to the Southern Highland Craft Guild, for some decent mountian music, which this one lacked."
3,Not really a soundtrack,"After seeing the movie ""Songcatcher"", I wanted the music from the show. A week of searching finally got me a copy of the ""soundtrack"" CD. Expecting to hear the music from the show, needless to say I was a bit disappointed to find that half the songs on the ""soundtrack"" weren't in the movie. Conversely many songs in the movie didn't make the ""soundtrack"".I emailed Vanguard records asking about this. Their excuse was ... to say the least.On the plus side, the music is still outstanding and aside from the above comments, I have no regrets in listening to the soundtrack. The music is far better than ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". Much closer to the real roots of the music and that I like."
5,"Wonderful Singers, Wonderful Roots Music","I came to this album without the predispositions others seem to have had and found a wealth of musical treasure in the singers and their songs. For the purist, there is Iris Dement's mournful ""Pretty Saro"" and Hazel Dickens' ""COnversation With Death""; for the post-modernists, Julie Miller's ""All My Tears"" and many commendable roots songs between these boundaries. For my money, Rosanne Cash's spare and heart-rending revival of ""Fair and Tender Ladies"" is worth the price of the CD. This is NOT a soundtrack--it is a compilation, and as with all such recordings, some outshine others, but I find the CD consistently strong and a great starting place for those wishing to further explore Appalachian roots music. Get it."
1,Not Really a Soundtrack to the Movie,"This soundtrack was a BIG disappointment. I thought the music in the movie was amazing and captured the spirit and life of the people of the Appalachian Mountains.But this drivel is more 'inspired' by the movie than 'from' the movie. Country stars riding the coattails of some beautiful, raw music. The best song from the movie (when the couple sings and plays violin on the porch after selling their farm) isn't even on the album.I'm going to try and return this tripe."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"If you, like I, wanted to buy this CD after seeing the movie, be aware that it is NOT the music you heard in the movie. Only three of the songs are from the movie: The song sung by the couple on the porch after they've agreed to sell their farm for $50, the Single Girl song by the old woman after they delivered the baby, and the Death song started by guy trying to buy everyone's farm and continued by the unknown man and then woman at the barn dance. All the other songs are adapted, or not in the movie at all. AND, that beautiful voice of the young girl you will hear for all of 30 seconds on this CD!!! I was very disappointed and would return it in a heartbeat if I could."
2,No one at their best on this one,"I bought this CD after learning about it on Gillian Welch's website. I really like (generally) Welch, Iris Dement, Maria McKee and had high hopes for this CD. After several listens, I can say that this is not what it's cracked up to be. Although Gillian Welch/David Rawlings are always great, their subject material for this song is their most gruesome yet (which is saying something). Maria McKee is not at her finest on here either (and barely sounds like herself). One of the most disappointing songs on the collection is ""Moonshiner"" which Uncle Tupelo did an excellent rendition of a few years ago. How could Uncle Tupelo make it sound so great and Allison Moorer make it so blah? I thought the song by Iris Dement was good and she managed to capture what this CD was supposed to be like. The CD is not all bad but (I think) is not that good either."
2,"Not very authentic, but a couple of good songs","This is an okay album if you are just looking for some listenable music, but in general the songs are overdone and not authentic-sounding (as in, they don't sound like mountain music but like something produced in some fancy studio). The exception is Iris DeMent's ""Pretty Saro,"" which is an absolute gem and perhaps makes the album worth buying for just this one song!!! There are some good songs on here, but if you are looking for real Appalachian tunes, you'll not find much of that. Of course, many of the singers have fantastic voices, so that's one plus. There are a lot of really good authentic albums out there, but this isn't one of them."
3,CD doesn't do the movie justice,"I have watched the movie over and over-- I am constantly blown away by the emotion and vocal strength.But the first track of the CD was disappointing. Roseanne Cash may be a talented singer, but she seems to have missed the whole point of the movie, and did no justice to the song ""Fair and Tender Ladies"". In the movie, it was sung much better by a young maiden played by Emmy Rossum.I can only imagine that there wasn't enough music from the movie to make into a straight soundtrack album, because it is the voice, accent, and emotion in the movie that grips you. The tracks on this CD that weren't from the movie lack all that made the movie great."
5,Lovely,"This CD isn't so much a soundtrack to the movie ""Songcatcher,"" as it is a companion album. Several songs on it are taken directly from the film and the jewel of these is Iris DeMent's startling version of the old traditional ballad ""Pretty Saro."" Those of you who have seen the movie will remember the sheer power and presence this song had when sung, in its entirety, by Iris who also has a small speaking part.The rest of the songs are songs that were ""inspired"" by the movie, but are not actually heard in it. Most of these are traditional ballads, but some are originals written to sound as if they could be old ballads.The overall result is a very enjoyable CD for anyone inclined towards this type of music -- acoustic based folk beautifully sung and arranged. If you are a fan of any of the artists here, and/or if you have seen the movie, it is difficult to imagine you not liking the disc."
4,Good but a little disappointing,"I'm finding an every increasing trend in the soundtrack industry that what you hear and love in the movie is NOT what you get when you buy the CD. Which is frustrating and disappointing. Of the 16 songs on the CD, 7 are recognizable from the movie; 2 of which are background music and 2 are only partials. There were wonderful voices, historic versions of songs, and pickin' and fiddlin' that I really wanted and had never heard before, and it's just not there. The other songs are good by known artists, but they have that modern sound. I wanted what doc had found in the movie. I guess, somehow, when it came time to put together this CD, a lot got lost in the fire."
1,not vista compatable,"I had a very dissapointed toddler and have had to go through Disney support to exchange for another game (they're quite amiable with this exchange), alot of trouble for us though, so caution when trying to run Disney games with windows vista"
3,Boring even for a 3 year old,"My toddler found this game quite slow. Not enough interactive to keep him going. If you have a child just starting out on the computer this may be a good way to help with mousse navigation, but otherwise too boring. Definitely too boring far a child over 4 already equipped with good computer skills!"
3,"Good content, poor structure","We bought this game for our (...) daughter and we were disappointed. There are virtually no instructions and the navigation between screens and games is mostly guesswork. On several screens we had to ask ourselves what the goal of the page was. Many of the games are nice and our daughter likes them, but the overall experience as a user is not great.It would be better if the game had some instructions included with the CD, and if there was a more Windows-like navigation to be able to choose the games. My goal for getting this game was to help her strengthen computer skills (such as mouse and screen navigation), but this one is not great for that."
1,NO MORE,"Badly written and by someone with no clue about the world she purports to describe. While one does not expect a mystery writer to be fully aware of investigative protocols, one is entitled to logical sequences and endings - both missing here. Go back to medicine and leave the writing craft to others, please, doc."
4,Just what I was looking for!,"Audiofile may think that the performance is ""tired"", but Peck's reading of the New Testament is exactly what I wanted. No musical score, no cast of thousands; no overblown, Shakespearean dramatization. Just God's word, read clearly and simply. Gregory Peck was a fine choice, and I never tired of hearing his voice.The only reason I rate this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would prefer the NIV or even the NKJV over the KJV, but this is the only version that Audible.com carries (as of 10/2002)."
5,Driving Psychedelia,"Have to agree, this is a great one!Head trip music with ethereal power surge at its best. Drive hard, drift, float and soar . . . Servedriver creates gargantuan layers of music to ride and dream on.A bit like Led Zepellin; all the power, all the blast, much more zero-space drift & whine. And (at least until all of those words reveal themselves), not the same tendency towards fits of pretentiousness.It's one of those records where you don't catch the words right away, but the ones you do sparkle, lurk and entice.Classic spaced-out hard rock, with lots of melodies and lots of different, strong, original melodic hooks. . .Overall Vibe - sex on lysergic? It's powerful . .."
2,Not up to swervedriver par...,"Ok, I've been a swervedriver fan since practically the first distorted note came oozin from their wall of sound and i gotta say it - 99th dream is a TOTAL dissapointment...Swervedriver are know (or at least were know) for a lazy angst that got me going every time...their previous albums are a tribute to noise and music and i was hoping they would get success so they could get money and not have to change to try and get fans...then they didn't get success, don't know about money - but the definately changed and now they sound like they are trying to compete with RadioHead and Oasis...99th isn't crunchy enuff and the vocals are too straight forward / in your face...not the lovely lazyness that made them imortal..."
2,thanks but no thanks,"I was really excited for this to come out. I pestered music store clerks for months, and advance ordered it as soon as I could. When it arrived, I rushed home (really!) so I could play it ASAP. But after I listened to this extremely boring waste of money, I felt totally [let down]. Where was the loud, crunchy Swervedriver I'd been a fan of since seeing them open for Soundgarden in 1991? ""Raise"" was and is one of my favorite albums, and ""Mezcal Head"" was awesome too, so how the heck could this be the same band as the one on those albums? I still don't know how such an injustice could occur, but at least I got 3 bucks for it at the used CD store."
5,Keeping up the excellent standards,"I'll admit, at first it took me a bit to get into it, but I certainly now appreciate the insane asylum theme....each spooky/beautiful song just has that much more meaning behind it. The occasional moan or two is almost scarier in the fact that it's human....at any rate, the music takes on many different forms and creates a very clear mental image."
2,"Footsteps, knocks & giggles","If you want to listen to something really unsettling, try Brian Eno's ""On Land"". It's the creepiest thing I've ever heard - and it doesn't rely on footsteps, knocks and giggles like ""Gates of Delirium"" does. Sure, the music here (when it's not overblown) has its moments, but it's really just a cross between a horror movie soundtrack and a Hallowe'en special effects CD. The track ""Haverghast Asylum"" reminds me of an outtake from Alice Cooper's ""Welcome to My Nightmare"". That might have been the intention, of course, but it adds up to a CONSCIOUSLY spooky listen, not a SUBCONSCIOUSLY eerie listen like the aforementioned album by Eno.If you're looking for background music to a game of Vampire: The Masquerade, I suppose ""Gates of Delirium"" will do the trick - but if you want to feel the goosebumps rise, put on a pair of headphones, turn out the lights, and listen to ""On Land"". Alone."
2,Good artist that play boring music,"I purchased this cd on an impulse. Mainly because the reviews were great and the art work on the cd is awesome. However, listening to the cd gives me a sense of bordom. The songs are too slow and repetative for my taste. I gave it two stars because there are hints of good music in the cd. Be aware that if you're going to buy any of Midnight Syndicate's albums like I did (in fact I bought the last three albums all at once), thinking you're going to get some kind of hint of heavy metal and industrial into the music you'll be disapointed like I am."
1,Save your money,"After two years it died, one full year out of warranty. While the VT55 worked, it was always noisy and the thermostat varied by over 12 degrees between on/off cycles. Buy a brand you can get service on, they want to sell me a new control panel for $55 with shipping, but I think I'll just bring it back. Let them deal with Costco - I'll get a new GE."
1,Poor Quality and Lousy Customer Service,"I bought a Vinotemp 28-bottle wine cooler 2 years ago and it suddenly died. I own another wine cooler that I bought 5 years ago and it is still working fine. A cooler is basically a refrigerator and it should last a very long time. I was very disappointed to see my cooler die after only 2 years. I contacted Vinotemp customer service and they basically offered to sell me a replacement board for $47 + $15 S&H. I thought this was a steep price for a ""quality"" product (as their tag line states). I asked for a discount on the board and they refused. Yet another poor quality product made in China!!! I recommend you try a different brand."
1,Vinotemp ruined my floors company does not care.,I purchased a Vinotemp beverage cooler and had it installed for less than a month before it leaked water and ruined my new floors. The company sent out a tech that verified it was a faulty door that should have been caught in there quality control process. Company hides behind fine print and will not answer emails. DO NOT deal with this company the shoddy products they sell can ruin your wine and property.
2,Product stopped cooling shortly after warranty ran out.,"I was pleased with the unit for the first two years I owned it, but then it stopped cooling. I called Vinotemp and they basically said I was on my own - they would not even try to help me find someone in my area to repair it. I can't find anyone reputable to even look at it. I wish I had spent a little extra money and gotten a better brand that could be repaired."
3,Good value,"I've only had it a few weeks, so hard to give a long range opinion. unit came in a day(!) and looks great. I have been monitoring the temperature with a portable thermometer to compare it to the LED. The unit is running hotter than the LED reads, but has been consistent. I have called Vinotemp for feedback, but have found their customer service folks to be incompetent. If I wanted a top of the line unit it would have cost 2.5x the money, so I am content with this item."
2,Noisy compressor - unstable thermostat,"We have only had our Vinotemp installed for about a month (we use it as a built-in in our kitchen), and it is so noisy when it is running that my husband wants to get rid of it.Also, we keep setting the temperature on 64 and it keeps dropping back down into the 50s. It apparently has a mind of its own on what temperature it should be set on.We like the look and size of this unit, but so far we are very unhappy with its performance."
5,5 Years & Still Running Great,"I've had my Vinotemp for 5 years now and it's worked flawlessly. I've read some other reviews that said the compressor was noisy or that it didn't stay at the set temperature. All I can say is that I have had absolutely no problems, it runs so quietly that I don't even know when it's on, and it stays fairly close to the temperature that I set it. I use a separate temp gauge to monitor the temp. and it stays within 2-3 degrees after I get it set correctly (large temp swings within the house such as hot 100F summer days will cause it to swing as well, but I feel that's to be expected).I'm selling my house and I like my Vinotemp so much that I'm buying another for my new house. After reading some of the reviews here that reported issues with their Vinotemp I felt compelled to write a review to report the good luck that I've had with mine. On top of that it's a great value compared to other models out there selling for $800 to $1400."
3,Just A Reminder,"I don't have this cd but if you are looking for ""Someone Like You"" by Van Morrisson on the ""Bridget Jones Diary"" soundtrack it is on this one."
4,Trailer music,"Hi, Someone like you has only just been released on DVD here in the UK, so i will be watching it this evening :-) The trailer music, if anyone is interested, features Kendall Payne's song ""closer to myself"" and is on her ""Jordan's sister"" album.Right... i'm off to blockbusters :-)"
2,Missed the mark for me,"This book was highly recommended to me, and I looked forward to reading it. However, I found the stories uneven, and while some of the them were quite good, others were forgettable. I passed it on to a friend to get her reaction, and haven't heard back yet."
1,The worse book she has written,"I am a Dorothy Garlock fan or maybe I should say I was. I love her writing style and the era she writes in. But this book was as if a 13 year old wrote the vulgar, filth in Hope's Highway. Yes people do use foul language but it seems as if Dorothy Garlock just discovered these words and sex and had to use it as often and rotten as possible to show she is all grown up. The two bad characters were not well written about at all. They were so in your face and outlandish, it was not at all realistic. Very disappointed, would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Shallow and simplistic,"I have a few problems with this book. It is written on an eighth grade level, but with adults themes and words. The author even repeated herself a few times. The characters were not believable. They weren't given any real emotions. The bad people were really, really bad and the good people were wonderful. Except the contrived ""misunderstanding"" between the two main characters, so the author could delay getting them together, the good characters were never cranky or sick. The bad people didn't have anything but evil in them. One dude turns horribly evil, but there are no realistic reasons given why. This book avoids a '1' rating because there was some interesting information about what it was like traveling along Route 66. Basically, this book wasn't romantic enough to be a good romance novel, and it was too shallow to be good fiction."
3,Somewhat disappointed with this one,"I am a Dorothy Garlock fan and I was so excited to start this. I really enjoyed it up until about halfway when I began to realize that some of the characters lacked any depth. Also, there was little or no mention of the depression era and the dustbowl. I found the romance sweet, but without a lot of depth or sophistication. The language and descriptions were simply stated and left me wondering if the two main characters were well suited for one another. I'm still a Garlock fan however, I've read enough of her books to keep we coming back... :)"
1,THIS IS NOT A GOOD GUN! DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this gun hoping for a decent weapon, but when i got it i had to charge the battery and then shoot. when i shot this gun it shot 2 bbs out everytime. so i lubricated the gun up, still shot 2-6 shots everytime i pulled the trigger. and then the battery died after 1 hour so i charged it again.it seems like after every charge the battery life gets shorter...i took the gun outside and shot a full clip into my leg .... didnt even leave a mark... the Fps obviously stinks because it only shot5yds ahead of me. Hotimporttoys never E-mailed me back so they really dont care about the customerthe onlhing good about this gun is its body, its full metal but some little parts are plasticDO NOT BUY THIS GUN WASTE OF MONEY"
1,NEVER WORKED FROM DAY ONE,RIPED OFF.... PURCHASED THIS GUN DAY 1 THE GUN FIRED ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN. TRIED THE CUSTOMER NUMBER LISTED IN PROFILE RINGS NEVER TALKED TO A PERSON. CONTACTED SELLER WITH PROBLEM VIA EMAIL SAID TO PRINT OUT THESE SHEETS FROM A WEB-SITE. DID SO. NOTHING WORKED. CONTACTED SELLLER EXPLAINING I THINK THE BATTERY IS DEAD CAN YOU SEND US ANOTHER BATTERY. NOW TELLING ME TO LAST THE RETURN POLICY IS 30 DAYS. ALL I WANTED WAS A BATTERY TO REPLACE (I THINK) A DEFECTED BATTERY. COMPANY NEVER ATTEMPTED TO MAKE IT RIGHT.. BUYER BEWARE.. CONCERNED MOTHER. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2,Not worth the money,I would not suggest this gun. It only shoots about 20-25 yards and isn't accurate. After I had it for about two months it busted and it never worked after that. This gun just never seemed to work well.
2,Awful,"This gun isn't good, I don't know if it is just the gun I was sent, which I think it was but never mind that. When I got this gun, I looked through the instructions for how long I was supposed to charge the battery It didn't tell me so I charged it for the standard 8 hours. When the battery was done charging I put it into the gun, loaded the magazine and started to fire. But the BB's didn't come out, they would just roll out of the barrel if I tilted it downwards."
1,BOOO.... I hate this company!!! BOYCOT H.I.T.,"I ordered this gun for my birthday and it took forever to come. When it finally arrived they sent me a CYMA AK47, not an AK47""S"" like the one in the picture. It was not full metal nor did it have a full metal gearbox, and from what I've read it shoots around 220 FPS and not the 300-350 FPS stated here. The gun I was sent was worth maybe $20.00 dollars. This is a huge ripoff, but I wasn't suprised because they can't even speak proper english, so their chances of getting my order right were already pretty low. I urge everyone to NEVER EVER X 1,0000 order from this company. you will only be disappointed."
5,sweet!,"This is my first airsoft and i have to say im impress, Great gun looks so real and shoots great, would buy anytime from this seller, very responsive:)"
1,"Please, please stop! I will confess anything....no more...","If I was running Abu Gharib prison, and looking for confessions from hardened terrorists, I think playing this kind of music for them would get early & complete confessions from all. No water-boarding needed!"
2,Ehhhhhh.........,This CD is average at best. C Murder is T R U 4 life but getting with a talentless faggot like Slim Thug...come on C tighten up your game.
5,"Cop this, The REAL dirty South","C-Murder delivers savage lyrics to real good beats, i can't fault one track. Just sit back & bop your head, you gotta love it! If you don't i can't understand why you're even on this page. TOP RAP ALBUM."
2,Library Reject,"I was disappointed to open my package and find a smelly discolored library reject book. It had all the library stickers on it and was stamped on several pages and sides. The described condition was used, not disgusting. Book itself was good, I considered wearing gloves to read it. Disappointed in seller though."
3,"Not bad, but certainly not the best","After having read ""The Unofficial Guide To Having A Baby"", this book just didn't compare. In only the first few chapters, there were references to ""hanging from the chandelier""! I admit, the idea of that was funny, but not what I was looking for at that particular point in time. And things such as that caused me to lose interest in this book - and fast! The ""Unofficial Guide"" mentioned above is a much better, more informative book in my opinion. Dr. Ruth's was so/so, but as I said - NOT THE BEST."
2,"Less about sex, more about how to be a patient","I bought this book in hopes of finding discussion of various positions for sex during pregnancy, coupled with emotional information and guidance about sexuality. While there is a bit of that information, the bulk of the information in the book is how to be a good OB patient. With line drawings of episiotomies, forceps deliveries, and a few dismissive paragraphs on home birthing and other birthing alternatives, Drs. Westheimer and Grunebaum strive to keep women in the dark about the culmination of the sexual act: the birth itself. If you need help in choosing an anesthesiologist or deciding which surgical procedure should be performed on you at birth, then buy this book. If you're looking for good information on intimacy during pregnancy, keep looking."
4,political dreams and furiously evolving theology,"Mudimbe does philosophy like a talk-show host or a parliamentary speaker. His benches are packed with hundreds of religious leaders, political thinkers, anthropologists and philosophers who have moved African self-understanding. Their discussions are most eloquent, but unfortunately there is scarcely a woman in the auditorium.In these pages Carl Sagan undertakes to test Dogon cosmology. Zulu Chief Buthalezi and F. Eboussi-Boulaga debate the directions of African religion. The ""Bantu Philosophy"" of Belgian priest Placide Temples is chewed over by ethnophilosopher Alexis Kagame. Mudimbe himself continually pulls the lines of thought together and sets the stage for our next adventure."
5,GOLD!!!,"Christmas gift for a spouse with a background in geology, an interest in prospecting, and a metal detector. It's a hit!"
1,Save your Money,"This brush works well at cleaning lint off clothes, but is very poor as a hairbrush - its bristles are too short and too soft. The brush slides over hair, rather than acting as a hairbrush should. It is cheap, but of little use. I found a much better boar bristle brush in the supermarket hair care aisle for the same price. My hair is quite short, so hair length should not have posed a problem. I would definitely not recommend this brush."
2,"Good durability, but burn errors galore","Blank CD-R companies always seem to be a hit or miss. Some have good durabilty, and some have good burning, some (only a few) have both, and some (once again only a few) neither. TDK is the company that has good durability of their CD-Rs, but almost half are errors.The packaging states ""48x"", so I burned at 48x on a Buslink drive (52x24x52). It choked, and took 10 minutes for Nero to say ""Burn error had failed at 48x"". So, I went lower at 32x. Same thing. Then I went to 24x and the thing finally worked. If a package says ""48x"", I'm expecting 48x, not 24x. Even at times 24x would choke and not burn correctly.Yes, I do have a few TDK CD-Rs that are 2-3 years old and look almost new compared to the 2-3 month old Sony, but with all these errors, will I ever get to experience that? Try looking at Maxell, Philips, and Samsung."
1,A complete waste of money,I bought a 100 pack of these from Office Max. I used them to burn data and music and most of them failed at various stages during the burning process. I am really disappointed with them. The Maxwell CD-R has worked better.
4,Hard To Find Movie Soundtrack,"I've been trying to get the soundtrack to ALL ABOUT EVE for years. I tried ordering it at several music stores and on I-Tunes. Nobody had it. Who knew I could get it on Amazon? This is the original soundtrack and it is excellent. Alfred Newman's score for this movie is as good as the movie itself. The only drawback is that since this is the original soundtrack, it is largely in mono, not stereo. There are a two tracks that were rerecorded in stero, but the rest is mono. There is no other place to get this soundtrack, so if you can accept the sound limitations of mono recording you will be very satisfied with this one. This CD also includes music from LEAVE HER TOO HEAVEN."
2,An LP Not A Digital Recording,Disappointing reproduction of soundtrack - from an LP and not from a new digital master
2,Cheap and crappy,"I saw the deal and jumped at it - I am restoring our 1930s craftsman and have a lot of staining to do. I usually pay .49/brush at the hardware store so this seemed like a good way to get cheap disposable foam brushes. One is as good as another. Yes? No!These things come apart FAST. I can do maybe 2 1x10 planks with a brush before it comes apart. And they come apart every which way - the plastic handles snap (these are not your usual wood dowels). The brush heads come right off the brush paddle. Not good.If you have tiny touch ups to do and the brush will be used for 5 minutes or less these will work. Otherwise, pass on these as more frustrating than worthwhile.Two stars for value and FAST delivery."
3,Does not last long.,I bought these thinking they will last as long as the more expensive foam brushes I bought at hardware stores such as Lowes or Home Depot. They do the job but only half the quality time. The tabs that are built in the middle of the foam tend to wear through the foam quickly and I use foam brushes all the time. They are great for a quick application where you do not use them for very long like over an hour as the tabs will work their way through the foam. You get a whole load of brushes but you will use them quickly. I used them for staining my cabinets and they were not worth another buy as they broke down faster than normal.
4,Exactly what you'd expect,"It's a large box filled with foam brushes, what can I say - all meet expected quality and shipping was very fast. If you need a lot of foam brushes, I would recommend this product."
1,"No good, even if they were free!!","Brush foam cracks open across the front after just a few swipes, making them unusable.Foam is just too cheap. Your money is better spent elsewhere!"
2,good but too generic,"this isn't bad, but too much smooth jazzy infecting the galactic vibe i was hoping for.pertty warm though for clinical new age music...but if you want that floaty, space station lullaby/lounge feel, getSTEREOLAB's First of the Microbe Hunters!again, liquid geometry isn't bad, but just a bit sterile.my chakras are yawning:)"
4,Little guide book,"This is not a film book. Ebert and some of his old English teachers have written an interesting guidebook, recommending a route that you can take for an enjoyable day's walk through historic London, visiting parks, historic homes and grave sights, and a pub lunch. I haven't tried the walk myself, so I can't vouch for it, but I do know that this book makes me keenly interested to fly to England and try!"
2,Dated and poor black and white photography,This book is an interesting ramble in and around Hamstead heath. It is a little dated now and requires an over haul. If you want to visit the heath (where parts of Nottinghill were filmed) there are better around however this one does offer an interesting if old perspective.
5,I AM IN LOVE & SO IS.....,MY HUSBAND. WE DON'T LIKE THE SAME MUSIC BUT WE BOTH LOVE THIS!! I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF RICK'S SINCE 1994/5. I OWN EVERY ONE OF HIS CDS ENGLISH & SPANISH. I LOVE RICK'S VOICE COUNTRY OR SALSA. HE COULD SING IN ALL SPANISH ALLDAY AT MY HOUSE. BUT I LOVE HIS BILINGUAL SONGS BEST!!
2,Gannibal is a tedious story,In theory this could have been a very exotic true story about a Moorish slave rising to prominence in the court of Peter the Great of Russia. In practice it is very tedious and more worthy of being a short story. Too little real facts seem to be known about Gannibal and thus the story suffers from tedious speculation and interpolation of what and who Gannibal was or had done. I got 1/3 of the way through and decided I had better things to do with my time.
3,Beware!,"This text is not at all exhaustive. As the title indicates, it is a study guide only. I used this (required) ""guide"" for a graduate level nursing course in epidemiology and health promotion, but I believe this book is geared more towards MPH courses. One would think there was an accompanying main text to go along with this ""guide."" Well, there is not. This is the main text, which makes it even more inappropriate for someone who is not majoring in epidemiology or biostatistics. So, don't expect this book to ""guide"" you through learning how to do biostatistics or epidemiology. You should have previous instruction in those areas or have a good instructor who will fill in the gaps for you."
4,A number of catchy songs not long progressive works,"No one was putting out long rock jams in the early 1980's and progressive bands like Renaissance were no exception. Southern rockers like the Allman Brothers and jam bands like the Dead were no exception. Record companies at the time must have viewed the longer pieces as dated. Yes was able to adapt to this chnaging landscape with 90125 and this is Renaissance's work in that mode.It's the second album with just the core trio and it is step up from Camera Camera, which is their least appealing work. It's still Annie doing most of the singing and she could sing anything and make it sound good. This is really an enjoybale record if you go in with the mindset that there are no ""Ashes Are Burning"" or ""Mother Russia"" type pieces. I will say John Tout on keyboards is missed but I think the band came out of the studio having done what they set out to do (or possibly were told to do.)"
2,Definitely Slow,"The Slow Air of Ewan Macpherson might've been a better book if the author had an ear for dialog...but he does not. The characters in this book talk to each other in the most oblique manner I have probably ever encountered in a work of fiction. I imagined them never quite meeting each other's eyes, talking to spots several feet to the left or above other people's heads, etc. The very bizarre and unnatural dialog in this book made the story less than enjoyable to follow.The story itself, once a reader is able to winnow it out of the ponderous, undirected dialog, is interesting...but not quite interesting enough to overcome the dialog."
5,First rate,"No More Myths is a super book on pet-care. I used to take my cues from the legends of the Tsimshian Indians of the Nass and Skeena River basins of British Columbia in the way I interacted with my spaniel Barry. Even allowing for a structural analysis of these myths, that's no way to treat a dog. This book, with its no-nonsense approach to pet-care set me straight, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to others."
1,"Terrible service, poor product","It not only smells bad (I could live with that), and it is loud - you do not want it in your kitchen or anyplace near where you hang out, it emits a loud buzzing noise - last but most important their customer service is terrible. My cooler simply won't shut off, it get's colder and colder and I have to uplug it to keep it from freezing. I have called them multiple times, they never return calls, and if you do reach someone they are no help at all."
4,Just thought I add I checked the BBB,"The other reviewer must have checked another Vinotemp, because the one I looked up at BBB had a rating of BB (high rating) on a scale from F to AAA. They had 6 complaints, 2 agreeing to perform per contract, 2 unassigned, and 2 denied. While not perfect, for the price of there product that's probably not horrible."
2,Poor match for the Grizzly G7942 5 Speed Baby Drill Press,"Robust if roughly built, this cross sliding vise is adequate for a range of occasional tasks. However the vise fits drill presses that are larger than the Grizzly G7942 with which the ""Shop Fox"" is sold. When partnered with the G7942 Baby Drill Press there is simply not enough room under the drill head to fit the vise in a useful configuration. Grinding off the rear mounting lugs helps, but is not a complete resolution of the clearance problem. The two components are a poor match at best."
2,rusty vise,Recieved vise double boxed inner box sealed with package tape not the normal paper tapemanafactures use. Both gibs on the vise where extremely rusty and pitted. Making the viseunuseable until I removed the gibs and reworked them
2,Pay for what you get,"At first glance out of the box, I thought this would be a good buy. Mounted it to the drill press and quickly realized that it wasn't cutting straight. I tried milling a piece of wood with straight edges and realized that it was cutting at an angle (from one side to another). I started in the middle of the piece and moved it away from me; from start to finish of the entire motion it was about an 1/8"" difference.I expected some slop in the tool upon arrival (which there is but its manageable). The casting and everything is good but if it doesn't cut straight, what's the point of having it?"
4,Make Room Make Room on the Kindle,"I wanted to focus specifically on the Kindle edition of this text. I enjoyed the book very much, finding Part 2 to be even more dramatic and thought provoking than the beginning. I found the other reviews to be fantastic for content. I would, though, recommend putting Soylent Green out of your mind and take the book as its own entity, which it is.The Kindle edition has many typos. I'm used to finding one or two typos in a book, but this edition is simply full of them. Multiple typos per chapter. Of course, the human brain seems to ignore it and you can easily tell what the word is supposed to be... but that isn't much the point. I previously had difficulty finding this book in print (because I'm snobby and want my books to be new instead of used most of the time) so it was a great way to actually get to read the text. It would be nice if they did an updated version, with less errors. They do get annoying after you've seen 20 or so of them."
4,Make Room!,"This book served as the basis for the movie ""Soylent Green."" It gives a fictionalized but realistic account of what can result from uncontrolled population growth, though its time frame (it was written in the 1960's and projected an unsustainable world population in 1999) is slightly off. It ranks with books like ""On the Beach"" as a warning about the future if steps aren't taken to ease the adverse impacts of worldwide population growth, potential for global warming, and other consequences of un-thoughtful urbanization and loss of arable land."
3,Enjoyable read,This was an interesting and enoyable read even though it was more of a prequel to the movie than a writing that mirrored the movie. I liked the main character development and could also see where the inspiration for the movie came from without it being directly said! Interesting parallels with global issues and politics today. Could be used in a high school or college class to generate discussion.
5,Depressingly realistic portrayal of one possible future...,"This excellent little book is often compared to ""Stand on Zanzibar"" by John Brunner, which is a very lengthy, complicated book on a technologically oriented future. Harry Harrison's ""Make Room! Make Room!"" is more realistic to my eyes: the cities are vastly overpopulated and there are shortages of everything, including food and water. There isn't much technology and it almost seems like human culture has reverted, by necessity, to a simpler, regime of satisfying basic needs for food, shelter, etc. The situation is described well, and there is a neat plot to boot that revolves around a detective trying to solve a murder and his girlfriend. Don't look for happy scenes or happy endings in this well-written book. Written in the simple, straightforward style of Asimov and Simak, it constitutes a thoroughly enjoyable, if depressing, read that makes one wish for a sequel..."
5,Grim depiction of the future,"""Make Room! Make Room!"" is an excellent sci-fi novel which envisions our overcrowded future. It is a very entertaining read, with vivid characters and a neat premise. The book will make you realize how much you take simple things like drinking water and living with only your family members rather than strangers. I think this book needs to be reprinted, and am saddened that more books of this nature aren't written today."
2,nothing wrong with the story . . . .,"My less than stellar review is based on the ridiculous number of spelling and other editing errors. I don't know it is exclusively in the Kindle edition, but there was even a passage that made no sense, and then that same phrase showed up a paragraph later where it was supposed to be. I know the book was not expensive, but I still question if it was worth the money for such a poor quality edition."
4,"surprisingly, better than the movie","I love the movie Soylent Green, which is based on this book, and had heard that the book was substantially different than the movie. Many of my favorite ideas from the movie - the whole 'soylent green is people' concept, Sol's poignant suicide scene - are not present in the book; the plot lines are substantially different. Instead, the book develops a sensitive and beautiful relationship between the cop, Rusch, and the girl from the apartment, Shirl. These characters are exactly as they are in the movie, as are Sol and the police chief, but are more fully explored in the book. The background is the same dystopian vision of an overcrowded future. In the book I found this interesting backdrop used to tell a very realistic and somewhat bittersweet love story. Highly recommended."
4,the basis for Soylent Green,"This novel was the basis for the 1973 sci fi classic SOYLENT GREEN. I would have to say that this is the one time where an adaptation is much better than the original novel; the film is a detective story; the novel just sort of wanders around so the author can show the disastrous effects of overpopulation. This is worth reading, but don't expect Soylent Green."
3,Not like the film...but refreshingly so.,"I'm a fan of dystopian stories and this one does not disappoint. The story takes place in 1999 and was written years before that, but it does not feel dated or old-fashioned. A very good read"
2,"Get to the point, please!","I read this book after seeing ""Soylent Green"" because it was the basis for the movie. The book is very different and I preferred the movie. While Harry Harrison is an excellent writer, the book dragged on and on. Where was the drama? Rather it was a love story set in the dirty overpopulated future NYC. And the ending left me with the bitter feeling of why did I spend my time reading this for it to end like that? I spent a considerable amount of time locating this book and I have buyers remorse."
2,No depth,"I ordered this book because it was based on the movie Soylent Green, although it would turn out that it had little to do with the movie. ""Make Room! Make Room!"" is hopelessly outdated. Overpopulation is no longer a threat for America, in fact, throughout most of the Western world, depopulation is much more of a problem. This book not only failed to retain its relevance into the 21st century, but it is also a poorly written book. The motivations of the characters are never explained, and their personalities are never explored. Shirl, a major character in the book, is only described as beautiful. Descriptions of her past relationships with her father and her suitors are left out. This creates no emotional resonance for the reader when someone dies, or leaves."
5,"Tom Clancy meets ""Left Behind"" and ""Enduring Freedom""","I recently got your new book in the mail, and just finished reading it.WONDERFUL!!!As others have noted, your writing style strongly evokes Tom Clancy, and I **LOVE** the idea that there will be MORE books arriving at regular intervals - just like the ""Left Behind"" series!!I cannot WAIT for the next installment!While writing about the near-term future involves the significant dangers of having events in the ""real world"" overtake your fiction, you have MASTERFULLY adapted your fiction to the realities of 9/11.THANK YOU for creating such a POWERFUL warning about military and economic threats - from both Red China and the Islamic fundamentalists - which we have thus far escaped, perhaps only for the want of strong leaders in these important areas of the world.Keep up the GREAT work!!!"
2,Read this first,"These five books tell the story of WWIII that pits the US & allies against China & Allies. There are a number of things that make this a hard sell. One problem with these novels is how long they are verses the writing style in the books. With five books you have a lot of paper to develop character depth and the author tries, but if you have read any of tom Clancy books involving Jack Ryan then you will be disappointed with the result, especially at (...) Canadian per book. The second problem is the Chinese capabilities in the time line the author has set the events are hard to believe, especially the logistic abilities. If you want to read this series check the library or second hand store first. Otherwise buyer beware"
4,Mostly a good story,"All in all, I found it to be a pretty interesting read. The world events were interesting, although as it was written close to ten years ago, it's a little out of date. In spite of that, I enjoyed the story, and I actually consider a U.S-China conflict to be a possibility.The only real complaint I have with the book is that it became too political at times. It's pretty obvious what the author's views are and I don't see how much of it is really relevant to the book.I would recommend this story to others and I intend to read the rest of the series soon."
5,Good,"This is such a perfectly practical little knife. The small blade is certainly sharp enough. The small philips screw-driver works perfect on my glasses that have philips-head screws. The bottle opener isn't the best, but it will get the job done. I have not had a chance to use the stripper yet, but everything else is great. So this is perfect if you don't mind losing the small scissors."
3,I was issued a used knife,"I've ordered about 6 of these knives previously, perhaps last year. Having an EDC knife and can opener instantly available (on my keychain) is truly the cat's meow. I was very pleased with the past shipment, they came in a nice 2 inch by 4 inch box, which was plastic wrapped. However, the knife I received a couple days ago was sent in a tiny 1 inch by 2 inch box box which was scotch taped on one end. Looked suspicious. Upon unboxing the knife, I was able to clearly discern smudges and scratches across both sides of the knife. They didn't come off after cleaning. It will cost roughly 50% of the value of this item ($6) to ship it back, or 25 minutes of my time. So I won't.I understand that the knife will earn even more scratches as time goes on. But I paid for a new knife, and this was to be a gift. Secondly, and more importantly, it shakes my confidence in Amazon's quality control. I will always harbor a slight doubt about this knife's reliability and authenticity."
5,The perfect pocket knife,This is the perfect size for a pocket knife. Victorinox has never let me down with these swiss army knives. The size of this one is good enough to fit your keychain without bothering and you have all the necessary tools. I've had it for almost a year and I'm still as satisfied as the day I got it. Highly recommendable.
2,Looking for concrete money advice? Look elsewhere...,"If you need help in how you think about and perceive money, then sure, this may be the book for you. But if you're a young, up-and-comer or someone looking to correct past mistakes with money--this book borders on worthless.A better investment is in Suze Orman's book, ""Young, Fabulous, and Broke"" which comes with access to online features which are really useful."
4,"Found the information interesting, informative and relevant","We need an Australian equivalent for some of the information in this book - not the author's responsibility, of course. It was a great confirmation of things I already do, and helpful for things I plan on doing"
4,"It's not where you are, it's how to get where you want to be","I was given the book by a friend, and started reading it just because I like reading. As I read, it was a good eye opener for great aspirations. It is not so much about where you are, but if you want to go far, you have to learn to manage what you have currently. It coaches on how to manage your money currently, work at getting better, and hopefully, some day be rich moneywise. There is an activity that analyzes how well you are on your way to getting rich, and I highly agree with that. There are areas that I do not agree with (Money has to be among the top 3 priorities in life) among others, but overall, great book. Her approach is very applicable in life too.I would recommend it to ""the nice girls"" out there. Those who find it hard to say 'No"" and especially to friends, those who think they have to match up a gift,... among others. I have recommended it to some of my friends, and bought it for some."
3,Written for the business woman,I think the value of this book to describe the mistakes that Lois has seen women make in the context of a business organization. Women who are not in that world may find it less relevant as the reviews have shown. I found it useful just as a description of her own observations..and I do think that it is true that many high-earning women do little or nothing to understand their own finances and just want not to bother with it. I also think it is a good idea to try to look at the big picture when choosing a career..but I also remember being young and in my 20's with my advisor trying to persuade me to go to medical school and I of course refusing all the advice of anyone over 30.
3,decent read,"This book was pretty good, still reading it actually. Its nice you can jump around to different topics. I will say a lot of it is stuff I already knew about my spending habits but hopefully I can put some of the advice into action!"
