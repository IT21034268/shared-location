2,Small with cheap parts,"This set is tiny, and I mean tiny. I am aware that this is a child tea set but for the price it is comically small even by children's tea set standards. The clear plastic insert to hold the set is about the quality of cheap toy packaging and won't last long at all, which means that at some point sooner than later you'll have a box of loose tea ware banging around in a box. I suppose the good part of this is that the tea ware itself is way to small to ever break."
2,Easily broken,"They break easily, even for a 6 year old who is pretty careful. Also the dishes are much smaller than we were looking for. My daughter loved the basket that it came in and thought that the dishes were beautiful. Overall, I wish that I had made a different purchace."
2,A little too small,"I bought this tea set for a 3 year old who loves to play tea. However, the cups and other parts were a little too small on this set. All tea sets are small but this set is actually kind of tiny which is why it is able to contain 30 pieces."
2,Cute...But Tiny,"My 3 YO daughter is a girly-girl and I bought this little teaset for her for Christmas. It's very cute, but it is very very tiny. The cups are maybe a half inch tall. I had hoped to actually have tea parties with my daughter (and son), but it's all just way too tiny for chunky/clumsy little fingers."
1,Flimsy and cheap,"Comments about your experience with this seller:My issue with the Butterflly Tea Set Is with the basket carrying case and not the tea itself. While the porcelain pieces are nice and the basket and gingham fabric are ""ok"", the molded plastic foundation inside is flimsy and not attached in any way to the basket; also the fabric covering the foundation is loose and/or bunched up, making it difficult to tell where pieces should be placed. In fact, two pieces are broken already after falling out before basket is fully opened. The set is basically unusable by my 3 year old.I find it hard to believe that this product could continue to be sold at this $30 price and I realize My particular set may be defective as most reviews don't mention this problem. I have contacted the seller with my concerns."
3,Too Small,"This tea set is absolutely adorable! Even with the other reviews, I decided to buy it because of the cute design. Unfortunately, it is too small (cups will only hold 2 Tablespoons when filled to the brim). My daughter is almost 4 years old and I purchased this to use as her birthday gift so that she could have tea parties. This set would be perfect for a pretend tea party! But, my daughter loves to drink real tea (she calls it honey milk because that's what I put in it) and usually drinks out of one of my smaller mugs. So, I am going to return this set and I just purchased an adult tea set that I think will be better suited for my daughter."
1,Not as advertised...,"As several other comments indicate, the product showed in the picture and described in the description is NOT the product I received. I ordered it because it was a 30 piece set with a carrying case that a fabric-covered interior with protective sections cut out to put the pieces in for travel. I received a set that only had a flimsy plastic interior that fell out when I opened it and is not protective or kid-friendly. I am returning the item as it is NOT what I ordered. The advertising/description is false.In fairness, I contacted the distributor with my complaint and they were quick, apologetic and professional and gave me a full refund for my purchase. But, I was still annoyed to have to go through the process.."
4,Girly Fun,My daughter has an absolute ball having tea parties with her dolls. I love that it comes with a basket to keep it tidy till the next time it is played with.
4,Nice Set,Nice set. All of the pieces are great. the basket is great. I don't like the inserts in the basket (cheep plastic). but overall very happy with the purchase
3,"Cute, but flimsy","My daugther loves it. It is very cute, but the toggle on the inside panel came off in my hand the first time we opened it."
5,Waste of time,"If you're in the same industry as me don't waste your time buying or reading this book! If you're in another idustry, state or country it will be the most valuble knowledge you will ever gain."
5,From a die-hard RP'er,"I've been playing RPGs since I was six years old. I got the very first edition of Rifts at the behest of my friend, who hyped it for months. After reading it (YES! You can read this cover to cover and not be bored), I was hooked. I have bought 14 of the books in this series to date, and even go back and read them just for their literary value from time to time. D&D with style and versitility. HIGHLY recommended."
5,RIFTS is an adventure that can capture the imagination.,"""RIFTS"" is an adventure that gives us a grim look at what could be. Set in a post-apocolyptic time frame it lets players of the game journey through the many territories of modern day Earth; only in this game it let's us see a ghost image of what is now. Setting the characters that the gamers play as up for many frightening descoveries as they explore the new world and fight off supernatural beings from other realms. Along the journey gamers will face many trials to uncover what truely happened to the once beautiful world we call Earth. After reading this I can't help but remember the last line in ""Planet of the Apes."""
3,"Not Bad, But Not Perfect","This game is, unfortunately, not GURPS. The game world is fun, the character creation isn't too bad... but there are a lot of errors and little problems with book. First off, it's a little disjointed. Races & Classes come after character creation & combat rules (why?), and there is no built in character sheet (giving you no idea what the character is supposed to look like when finished). Also, unlike a lot of games there is no start-up scenario in the book to help you get an idea of what the heck you're doing. If you're real curious, go for it. If you can figure it out you're golden & you'll have a hell of a good time, but if you just want to jump into a new game try GURPS instead."
4,Don't over pay.,"Don't pay more then 39.99 for this book. you can buy it NEW!!!! at Palladiumbooks.com. If you pay more then the asking price, you are getting ripped off."
4,One excellent RPG,"I have read this book, and I loved it. That's surprising, too, because I'm not a hardcore RPG player. Rifts is far from ordinary. I thought that the plot was very origional, even for the sci-fan and post-cataclysmic plots people (including the authors) classify it as. The only problem with the book, that I have noticed to the moment, would be the soldier's armor for the coalition. It's overdone and doesn't make much sense-- not due to colors, but the shape. I saw no real need for the spiked shoulders and skull-shaped helmets, or any of the other nonsense cluttering the ""uniforms"". There's nothing wrong with style, but it should be realistic style, particularly for a government that rules machiavellian and enforces its rule over people with propaganda. That's probably the sole reason, to the moment, why I didn't give it five stars. I'd like to give it four and a half, but no can do."
1,Anthony Swofford should have paid me to buy this book,"this book is awful terrible writing and alot of BS i cant wait for the movie to come out because within a month it will be out on DVD because its awful swofford should change the name of this book to ""0 KILLS MY STORY OF SITTING AROUND IN THE DESERT AND TELLING LIES"" if i saw my dog buying this book i would whip it save your money i am glad i only gave a dollar on the used books for this because its terrible i want my dollar back"
2,Not very good...,"Read, 'Christian Family Guide Explains The Middle East Conflict' it's much better. David Dolan's outline's just to dry and poorly written."
3,Good but not great,"If you all ready Have Beard on Barbeque or Cook It Out Dors ther is very little new here.I collect all James Beard books I can find and this one is well writen, with several great recipes but since he wrote so much about out door cooking very little here is not in other books."
2,REALLY ANNOYED,I LIKE THESE A LOT FOR MY DOGS (3) BUT ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE...SO I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT AND I DON'T SUPPOSE SELLER CARES WHETHER THEY ARE REVIEWED OR NOT!!!!!!!!
5,Better than Suze Orman,Mackey McNeill's wisdom is far superior to any of Suze Oreman's work. From this book you will learn how to change your money life and create the money life you always wanted. It is a must have book.
5,A new dawn:,"Mackey's book sheds light on the shadow of money issues-a subject that I usually like to leave up to ""luck"". It is delightfully designed-and the questions were so provocative that I decided to actually use it as a workbook-rather than simply browsing through it. I feel my ""money-mind"" opening!"
5,A fun way to count down the holiday!,"I bought this for my 7 year old and he loved it. Each day he would open the box and carefully place the piece in the scene. It became part of our Christmas decorations. There is some assembly required though, so make sure you're aware before Dec. 1st."
5,Rainbow Crystal Science Kit,"This was a great kit for my six year old girl. She needed some help from her dad, including explanations of how the experiments worked but overall, it was a fun project and a neat introduction to very basic science. This kit contains a few different experiments so you can break it up into a few afternoons so young attention spans don't get overwhelmed. Everything included is non-toxic; the only thing you need to watch out for is staining if a little gets spilled."
2,Not his best work.,"I loves Keikth Laumer's earlier works, but I found this last entry in the series to be much like a 100 page story told in 200 pages. It seemed to lack the tight, slightly snarky, clever plotting of his better known works. I'm not sorry I read it, but there was an awfully lot chaff with this wheat."
1,Trivial Pursuit book,"As another reader stated, this book IS NOT what the title suggests. I also purchased this book for it's ""Applied .NET Framework Programming"" title to find that it doesn't go into programming applications at all! Instead it is mainly Trivial Pursuit-like information on the lower level structures used to support various C# constructs.Who cares? The whole point of the BCL and C# is that I don't have to know about this stuff. I'm paid to deliver applications - not tell my management how cool .NET is internally. And we programmers wonder why management won't buy into this stuff :( Until we learn to focus on how a framework results in faster time to market with more bullet-proof applications instead of the ""gee-whiz"" factor, how can we hope that our managers will ever care?"
2,Check OReilly First,"This book is better than most microsoft press books, but as a rule of thumb always check OReilly first. Microsoft Press is known for fluff - even books people consider the bibles are fluff when compared to OReilly. After reading a few OReilly pages you'll say 'gee that was simple'.I don't work for OReilly, I've been a Unix programmer for 15 years and used OReilly for a long time. I am now switching to .NET. I was very disappointed when I tried to use MSFT Press books to learn anything.Steve"
4,.NET Intro,"This book serves as a great introduction to the building blocks of the .NET Framework. I've always enjoyed Richter's professional, competent writing style and would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to find out what the .NET Framework is all about, how it works, and how best to utilize it in your own .NET development."
5,A Must Read for .NET Programmers,"Jeffrey Ricther has written a very thorough yet readable book describing Microsoft's .NET Framework from both 3,000 feet and, at the same time, 1 millimeter. His direct interaction with the Microsoft team that developed .NET has proven to be a competitive edge that other .NET books currently on the market lack. If you're serious about .NET programming in any language, this is a book you need to buy and read multiple times."
5,"Amazing book, but ....","As most of the reviews suggest, it is a great book and I highly recommend you to buy it.There is a cheaper alternative to buying this though. Search for The Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming in C# Collection by the same author (Jeffrey Richter). That edition contains this book with lots of additional materials (CDs, Class Library posters etc) and surprisingly its MUCH cheaper than buying this by itself."
5,All you need to know about the .Net Framework.,Don't go here if you are trying to find a good book on VB.Net or C#.net. Before reading about the Languages around the .Net Framework one should gain an understanding of the framework as a whole. I have bought many books (50+) and this book is the best book that I have read so far about the .Net framework. It is very comprehensive and describes in detail about the types and classes that make up the framework. If your a .Net programmer have fun with it. A MUST BUY!
1,Title is a bit misleading.,"I bought this book because of all the good reviews...but. This book looks at .NET from a very low leverl. I just wanted to be able to write programs with .NET. I didn't really care about how it works and why it does things. I wanted a little bit of a higher view of things. Perhaps I didn't understand the reasons behind starting at this level. It was a good book for C#, but not for general .NET programming. The new Visual Studio was not touched at all. It was basically about writing your code for optimum use for the .NET platform. I found the information not very useful because I wanted a book that would immerse me in the environment and help me to use the tools, not look at how the compiler interprets the code and how to look at it. My 2 cents."
5,Well Worth It,"For the first 17 or so chapters I felt this was a pretty good book, giving a little more detail on many topics than what is found in the vast majority of books and articles. Then I hit the chapter on exceptions and I became more enthusiastic. This is a good explanation of exactly what is going on inside .NET exceptions with examples of how to limit performance hits that I haven't seen anywhere else. Well beyond the typical ""this is the try block, this is the catch block, this is how finally works - don't catch what you don't handle"" litany.Then I got to the chapter on garbage collection. Wow. Laid the whole topic bare with deep detail and concise explanations. I am now the office guru when it comes to how garbage collection is affecting our performance. This chapter alone may be worth the price of the book."
5,You simply must read this book,"It was great to read a ""bottom-up"" book after having read somany ""top-down"" books.... I can heartily recommend thisbook to anyone interested in learning about the*nuts-and-bolts* of things such as the CLR, Framework and the Common Type system.The book clearly explains what assemblies are, how they are structured, and how they are used by the runtime to enforce strong versioning and allow such things as side-by-side execution of assemblies of the same name.In short: this book has totally blown my mind!After you read this book, you will have an abundant understand the *entire* architecture of .NET, including such things as:o Assemblieso Intermediate Languageo Common Language Infrastructureo Structure of an Assemblyo Various deployment tools including csc.exe, AL.exe, GACUtil.exe, etc."
1,incredibly deceptive title,"this book is a complete 'under the covers' look at .net, which is a fine goal in and of itself. however, applied to me means means 'applying .net towards accomplishing a given programming goal', which this book will *not* help you with at all. If you want to know all the underlying details (which is sometimes useful) this may be a good book, but if you want to learn new tricks and techniques for actually using .net in your daily programming work or to program something, this book is a huge detour.Just wanted to make people aware that the title is totally incorrect for what the contents are, I'm returning it since it wasn't what i thought it was."
4,A Good Basic Introduction to the CLR,"Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming is a solid introduction to the CLR. Richter provides a peek under the hood of delegates, the garbage collector, finalization and application domains.The book contains a mixture of practical advice and technical trivia. Some C# knowledge would be useful to get the most out of the numerous examples.There is a good level of detail for such a readable book. If you want more technical information about IL and the CLR, Gough, J. ""Compiling for the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR)"" might be a good follow-on from Applied .NET."
4,Good but not a classic,"I was fascinated by some parts of the book(the chapters on delegates, exceptions & GC are really good), but some of it left me saying ""duh"". Richter does state the obvious at times, but all-in-all this book has a lot of info that you just can't find elsewhere. I think that the complaint of some reviewers dealing with the ""trivial"" nature of some of the info is valid, but some of the info is essential for writing tight code(the boxing info. for instance). Richter always brings good common sense to the table, and has a gift for explaning things clearly. I've read other .NET authors who don't."
5,Must read !!,"A Must Read!! This is by far the best book on Common Language Runtime that is out in the market. This book treats the reader to an indepth, accurate coverage of the fundamentals of CLR.I have been working on the CLR for the past 1 1/2 years and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book!!Ravi"
1,Looks great in the picture but not in reality,"Picture perfect only, on hand looks very inconspicous and sometimes down right ugly. If the leather strap is replaced by a similar looking ionised aluminium metal strap it would look great"
5,Another cross-sections...another good review,"Finally, a cross-sections that gives the audience a look inside the buildings of Star Wars! Why they waited so long to release it is anyone guess, but the wait is over. If you've read my reviews for the other cross-sections books then you know how much I love cross-sections. That said, Inside The Worlds Of Episode 1 breathes new life into The Phantom Menace. Particular favorites of mine include Otoh Gunga, Watto's junkshop, the Galactic Senate building, and the Jedi Temple. Not only does the book talk about particular locations in the movie, but also the very planets that the movie is set on: Naboo, Tatooine, and Coruscant. Inside The Worlds Of Episode 1 is full of wonderful illustrations and is packed with amazing information. Indeed, it's the chosen one...of cross-sections books, that is."
3,Orange...orange,This was okay for my meet but she still likes her cuttle bones the most! The orange flavor was interesting to her.
5,Great Product,"My 2007 car sets outside 24/7 summer and winter. The paint finish has gotten where it feels like sand paper even after and good wash and wax. It is almost imposable to remove all the wax and never do I get that nice shine and smooth feel. I thought I would give this product a try and sure glad I did. No, it will not take care of the marks those idiots in Wal-Mart parking lots can do to your car. It took me about 2 hours to Clay my car and WOW the finish is so smooth and now has that shine like it had 4 years ago. I then applied a good coat of Meg 26 and this baby looks Great. I have use many products over the years to get the clean finish, but this is the best I have ever used for the home do it your selfer that works!"
3,Cannot remove hard water stains on the paint,I bought the aggressive clay hoping it could remove the hard water stains on paint. It removed may be 30% of the stain but still many stains left. It does give the surface a very smooth feel though.
5,Fantastic find!,"So imaginative, so colorful without going overboard and being kitchy.It is a truly enchanted book, I just couldn't wait to pick up my brush and paint frogprinces and grinning vegetables.I ususally paint murals, serious ones, so this was such an unexpected delight.It is different,even beginners could do it,it doesn't require the usual drawing skills, if You doodle, You can do it!Bobbie's creatures are loveable,easy to paint yet rewarding,and You can just come up with new ones once You are done with the book.I found myself designing more and more.It's inspiring,good for the soul,a fun little challenge,enjoy!"
5,amazing.....,"I just bought this cd. Yes I know a little late to buy their secon cd but I think it was good that I bought a perfect way to spend 15 dollars. I especially like songs Like better off dead, dress to kill and hit or miss after previously releasing it on Nothing gold can stay but this version is so much better like a wise person all reaady stated this is there second best cd. I would defintely say its a little better than catalyst only because there are more songs you can learn to like. Only thing is this Cd can't hold a candle to sticks and stones. Every song on that album is just burst of energy . So i say that this is a awesome cd."
5,Best Emo/Punk Album,"NFG is one of the best emo/punk bands out there now. This is there sophomore effort and definately their greatest yet. It deals with growing up, relationships, and life. Boy Crazy, Better of Dead, 3rd and Long, Hit or Miss, Sucker, Second To Last are all great songs. Guitar is great with drums and lyrics. Jordans voice goes great with the music."
3,satisfied,"i came to find nfg by browsing through ""people also bought this"" on amazon. i never heard these songs before, but ""hit or miss"" especially, and like half of it i thought were pretty cool. im not dissapointed at all. yeah, tom d doesnt have the greatest voice, i like mark hoppus's better."
1,A Scenesters Dream Come True,"Catchy yes, a top seller, yes, RADIO FRIENDLY, yes....New Found Glory, formaly A New Found Glory (Just NFG sounded more ""punk"") has created a masterpeice for kids that are just dying to be ahead of the crowd....those who want to say they are ""punk"" in the commericial sense are in heaven with this album....The first album was good, the second was alright, and the third has hit rock bottom...The way mainstream punk has been going is to become as immature and silly as possibly....And on the third attempt NFG has succeeded fully....This album is just what a punk crazed scenester needs in their cd collection...side by side with MXPX and Blink....Enjoy...."
3,Not bad,"NEW FOUND GLORY are a cross between LESS THAN JAKE and BLINK 182. I bought the album on the strength of ""hit or miss""But i was quite dissapointed really because their weren't many stand out tracks apart from ""vegas"" ""boy crazy"" and ""sincerely me"" But the rest were more or less the same. Although NEW FOUND GLORY aren't as good as LTJ and B182 thy are still a quality band with lots of potential which should be used on their next album. Overall its not bad but it isn't brilliant."
2,What was i thinking,"I reviewed this Cd a year ago exactly. WHAT THE [HECK] WAS I THINKING GIVING IT 5 STARS?!?!?!?!?! a couple days ago, i put this cd in my cd player, and i cant believe i bought this. it's like hearing nsync with guitars and an extremely annoying voice. the only song thats decent is the second one. dont waste your money on this ..."
5,expanding the narrow definition of punk,"i just saw these guys at the end's board this 2001 here in WA, and they're awesome. i also downloaded a live show of theirs... hahaha. but this cd is the best cd since sliced bread and they are super good live too. buy the cd these guys write lyrics that you can relate to, like ""boy crazy"" and the music is upbeat with catchy hooks, like the bass line on ""sincerely me"", and choruses, like ""ballad for the lost romantics"", this cd is flawless and i haven't stopped listening to it for like 4 months. and they're way better than both blink182 and homegrown so buy this instead."
5,This CD rocks!!!!,"Definitely my favorite CD. I can easily listen to this CD straight through and I listen to it about four times a day. There isn't a bad song on this CD. It's worth whatever Amazon's charging for it. I'm not even the biggest punk fan, but I absolutely love this CD."
3,Not bad..,"When I first put this CD in my D player, it was in there for about 5 months.. it was all I listened to, Ithough it was amazing. What happend? I dunno... I think Jordan's whiney voice just must of drilled a head in my brain. Its an ok CD, and really entertained me for 5 moths, but now, I really wish that I'd bought something else."
2,I dont get it...,"Where's the appeal in this band?...i dont even hate emo or anything because im actually somewhat of a weezer fan. Come on! Besides being a bit catchy this ""punk"" is melodramatic ""am i waiting too long, to find that special someone"" (what were they thinking??), and plain bad...Heres a good emo weezer quote to make up...dont buy this stupid MTV ""pop-punk"" garbage.""why are you so far away from me, i need help and you're way across the sea"""
5,THIS IS SO GOOD!,"if any one has heard this album im sure they would agree that its brilliant!their album is realy good but i hope seeing them live will be better because im seeing them on wednesday - i cant wait!every one that likes blink, sum 41, and other punk will definaltly enjoy this c.d."
4,"New Found Glory rocks, and so does they're cd","HEY GUYS!! nfg rocks. They are definately one of the best punk bands out, if not the best. THey're catchy, and their music just rocks......like ""hit or miss"" or ""eyesore"". They're really truthful, yet happy, energetic, and uplifting punk rock. They're music is fast at times, but then will stop and slow totally down, and then go again. And jordan, the singer, has an awesome voice, it rocks. Its definately punk pop, but power punk too, but not emo. IT ROCKS!! I very rarely say, but this is one of only like 5 cd's that i would listen to the whole way through and not skip one song, maybe every once in a while, but i've had this cd for almost a year, and i still love it. ITS AWESOME!! so guys, its clean, happy, and awesome, SO GO and buy it, THEY ROCK!!"
5,hahaha,"hahaha! theused!? MyChem? i cant even listen to those bands with out puking and thinking...what kind of man wears womens cloths and makeup...and just happends to sound like a women? well the members of the used of course...and the singer of my chem..but aside from that, this album is the balls in my opinion their best one, aside from nothing gold can stay...so yeah if you dont like NFG you can go take your ""mates"" and listen to some pussy new wave hardcore wanna be bands and slit your wrist while your at it :) peace out brotha's..oh and buy this album..its the balls...again lol"
1,Vomit!,"What is the deal with New Found Glory? I don't get it! I've listened to it because my brother owns this cd, and frankly, it sucks. The guy's voice is terribly annoying, and they just come off as extremely...I can't even find the word. I am amazed they've made it this far. It is quite sad what is happening to the pop punk genre. I can recomend much better. I even like Blink182 more than New Found Glory. In my opinion, Sum 41 is probably their complement and is probably my favorite band in the pop punk genre. Another band close to that is probably The Vandals. All of which are better than New Found Glory"
2,this cd sucks guys,"i got this the day it came out popped it in the stereo and suffered a big blow of dissapointment...what happened to the raw nifty sounds? all of these songs sound basically the same. However, think of it as party with yourself music,even thought it sucks it is still fun to bop to. and they are just a really good live band, sooooo much energy. so if you are a fan of nfg you may as well pick it up to top off your collection, but if you are a newcomer to them do yourself a favor and get nothing gold can stay or the ep which is so underrated, i love it. yeh so buyers beware, this sugar coated album gets really annoying after a few listens."
5,great their best album dont buy their next one its ****,great album made when new found glory where at their prime their next album is like burnt meat compared to this great buy it.
3,Not that great,"Alright, i'm sure most of these reviews are sorta bias since most of them are from rock,punk,alternative,metal or wtahevver listeners. But i'm not one of them. This is is alright, but the new one is better. If you're a new to listening to nfg, go buy the sticks and stones."
4,New Found Glory,"This is a great CD! I'm not sure if it is their best, but it is a must have if you are a NFG fan!"
2,pop/punk for the mainstream only,nfg is alright this is a good cd if your into pop/punk awhile ago i was (for the 5 min before everybody had heard of them) but it grew old fast check out bouncing souls or flogging molly if your ready for a change i know i was
5,~*AWESOME*~,This cd is the best cd that i have ever bought! it is so cool I love a new found glory and this was their best cd yet!
4,NFG - posers? but love them!,"I first heard NFG by accidentally downloading one of their songs a year and a hafl ago. The song was ""Heaven."" (It's a cover). I instantly loved them, and downloaded ""Hit or Miss"" and ""All About Her."" I became a NFG fan right away. Although they are what most people would call ""punk"", true punks know that this is more pop than anything else. Sort of like Blink182, but with better lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I love NFG! If you prefer poppy punk, you'll love them too. If you like hardcore, you're better off with bands like Rancid, NOFX, AFI, etc. The tracks on this CD are great, from the sweet rythmic melodies of ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""Eyesore"" to the upbeat, catchy sounds of ""Hit Or Miss"", ""All About Her"", and ""Sucker."" I definately reccomend this CD to pop punkers."
3,Good...just not as good as it should have been,"The new A New Found Glory cd at first seems as good as the debut full length. But after several sittings it becomes apparent not as much thought was put into the making of this cd. The second track ""Dressed to Kill"" shines as the best track on the cd. It is classic New Found Glory style...whereas most of the other songs sound like all the touring with Saves the Day has rubbed off on them. All in all it is a decent cd. Just not what I was hoping for from these coral springs boys. Better luck next time"
5,PURELY AMAZING,"this cd is the best cd i have prob ever heard, i listen to it atleast once every single day, its so amazing,better off dead is an awsome song to start ot off with the lyrics are crazydressed to kill as it says it def is a killersincerly me awsome song beutiful lyricshit or miss can't get enough of itsecond to last my fav song on the album you just wanna rock out when you hear iteyesore slow but very meaningfulvegas sick songsucker the best songblack and blue alrite but still phatboycrazy the best song espesciaslly how it rips girls apartall about ehr is the dope song i love itballad of the lost romanrtics has the most meaning of any songs i love itGET THIS CD"
1,...,"at one time a new found glory (or should i say new found glory since they recently dropped the a)was an amazing band and one of my favorites, but this cd is one of the worst punk cds i have ever heard. it is just a bunch of bad girly pop punk. the original hit or miss was a great song, and all though they did not change it much, they found a way new version is horrible...."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this album, but after I listenend to it a few time i was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I like the album alot, but it just doesn't compare to Nothing Gold Can Stay. The slick production of the new album doesn't fit well with their style, I much prefer the gritty charm of their other albums. The new version of Hit or Miss just isn't as good as the original. They sound like they are holding back, restraining themselves. Eyesore sounds like a backstreet boys song with guitars. New Found Glory is a great band, but this album makes them sound like cheesey pop stars, they might just be ready for MTV. Ugh."
1,They Missed Badly,"I love how bad these guys really are. You know you're really trying to make it big when your first big single on your new cd is a freshly remade version of a bad song on your old cd. They are simply trying to follow in the footsteps of the extremely bad Blink 182 to try and strike it rich by overproducing their so called punk album and making funny videos. In fact, whenever another band like this comes along, there should be a 182 added on to their name just to warn the public that the music is unoriginal and boring. But if you must be trendy like all of your friends, go out and get this cd now."
1,"this is a dark day for ""punk""","It sounds like one song over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over- AND over - again."
1,Not Really Good,"After hearing so much about NEW FOUND GLORY, I went out and bought this album. As a fan of emo in general, I was expecting this to be awesome. Unfortunately, I believe it is terrible. I don't feel NFG classifies as ""emo"" - they sound more like a pop punk band like Blink 182. The lyrics are awful and all songs sound the same. I'm sorry."
2,Disappointed,"Wow I'm suprised at all the 5 stars. This CD, unlike Sticks & Stones, Nothing Gold Can Stay and Catalyst (their best yet) has no personality. Every song sounds exactly the same and you'll get extremely confused as to which track your listening to. The melodies aren't even that catchy. Plus, its completely forgettable. I listened to this CD all the way through about 3 times and I can only remember one song: Hit or Miss (which is the only good song on here). This label goes out to pop-punk bands alot, but I think this CD is seriously Nsync with guitars, every song is about relationships and they never branch off into any other topics. At least on Sticks & Stones they had Sonny, which was about somebody who died. Buy Catalyst instead."
5,One of the most listenable CDs ever.,"NFG's Self Titled, and most recent release, carries more replay value than about 90% of the CDs I own. It's so catchy and talented; yet it has this awesome, raw edge that only New Found Glory can add to a music genre that isn't known for being raw at all. These songs, just like the ones on ""Nothing Gold Can Stay,"" get stuck in your head for what seems like forever. And that is a good thing. The band has not let up at all, infact, opposite to what many have said, this release is actually heavier than their previous ones. My advice is to buy it now, kick back, and listen to some awesome tunes. I dare you to sit still while you're listening to NFG, you won't be able to. Not with songs like ""Better Off Dead,"" ""Sucker,"" ""Eyesore,"" ""Hit or Miss(new version),"" and ""All About Her."""
3,GOOD......YEAH THIS IS GOOD,"with so many pop punk bands around these days, it's hard to find a band that you can really hold on to. unfortunately, ANFG isn't really that band. the songs are great. very well produced, catchy, great melodies, and solid breakdowns. however, it's not original. that's the ONLY problem. eyesore is a great song, really emotional. but warning: THIS IS NOT EMO. THIS IS POP PUNK. ANYONE WHO SAYS IT'S EMO DOESN'T KNOW CRAP. anyway, if you like these cats, you'll like the ataris, same type of tunes."
5,NFG DOES IT AGAIN!!,"The great punk/emo style that was brought to us in 1999, has come back. This cd is almost as good as the first. No band's second album is as good as there first one but this sure comes close. With a great re-do of the most popular track (and show headliner) ""Hit or Miss,"" it is a sure ""Hit"" so dont ""Miss"" this album. With song themes ranging from ""girls"" to ""girls"" it is surley something to listen to with a loved one. 12 Tracks of pure power i must say. Although if you are lucky enough to get one of the first 5,000 copys made, you will get to enjoy an extra slice of NFG goodness with the track ""So Many Ways."" Be sure to pick up ""Its All About The Girls"" ep, ""From The Screen To Your Stereo"" ep and ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"""
1,Why bother,"Ok so i read one of those things on this web site that tell you like if you want to listen to good music read this... that was so not true they sent me to NFG... i have nothing against NFG but its not ""Punk"" music. I listened to this whole CD and wanted to shoot my self... have you heard this guys voice and all those power chords on the guitar were getting annoying... if you want good ""Punk"" Music go buy a Distillers CD or some Dead Kennedys... If you want more of poppy punk then go with NFG or GC or Blink 182.""Dude did you see that guys mullet... It was AWESOME!"""
1,Disgrace,"I dont know where to start on how horrible nfg's music realy is...Along with their queer peers such as ? Gay charlotte,green day, avril levign, blink 182...All that crap you hear mtv play? Is not by any chance, punk but its the opposite of punk and its a disgrace to the genreand you want to kno why other country hate us? Again, listing to what mtv plays also, mtv fools lil kids into making them think that what they play is good...Now, thats evil! As i said before, you want punk ? Listing to ramones,pennywise,dk,sex pistols,rancid,anti-flags,bad religion now those are bands i grew up listining and i still enjoy their music very much but since im not 100% a punk lover and more of a metal lover? Those bands i did named are basically the one punk bands i can say i did love and apreciate as a young kid. If you have self respect? Do not support what mtv plays!"
2,Generic,"I listened to this and I thought I was listening to the same thing over and over again. The lead singer cant sing right. It sounds like he tries to sing like Claudio from Coheed and Cambria but this guy cant pull it off. I could play better drums, guitar AND bass than these guys. They are horrible and Im surpised to say that they have gotten worse."
2,"Dammit guys, your abandoning your roots!","I happen to have gone to high school with these guys and were good friends, I can say that back in the high school days when they were doing the local club scene, they rocked no doubt about it. Chad man, where has your head gone? start pumping out the old hard punk that I remember you all. This CD unfortunately is horrible. The songs are all Blinkified and little 12 year old girls are willing to give you their virginity. Jordan, Chad...Do me proud guys, go back to your roots and the world will be a better place once more"
2,An entire CD of the same good song...,"The CD is decent, until you realize you can't tell one song from another"
5,WOW,"when i first heard this cd..well it was 4 days ago. i was lookin around at some mp3s and i fell on this cd. i downloaded it and listened to the first track and it was the greatist thing i had ever heard. i love this cd so much and yesterday, i went... and bought all 3 of their cds. This band is great and when they hit it big i will be very happy. this is the greatest cd of the year so far."
5,Bounce Around With Energy,"I picked up this album after hearing ""Hit or Miss"" and i love the rest of the songs even better! They are all really energetic songs and the sound is kinda pop mixed with awsome guitars and drums. The songs aren't crude like blink 182, they are mostly about love and the ups and downs etc. But it is the coolest CD. One of my faves! Check it out."
5,These are great!,I reviewed two similar candy molds that were less then satisfying but these are great. We have used them multiple times and the design is very distinct on every lollipop we make. I highly recommend them.
3,Simple Man covers,"Yes to Paul's review. Gov't Mule (Warren Haynes) does a great Simple Man. But the best ever, and even better than Skynyrd, is Shinedown's acoustical version. That guy can sing!!! Perfect tone control. And to do it acoustical without a bunch of loud instruments covering it up takes balls. Check it out."
5,Easy to use guide...,"This book is such an easy to use guide for anyone interested in game development. I have recently become very interested in this subject and found the examples easy to follow and use. Also, the CD tutorial that comes with the book is very resourceful!!! I hope to see a follow up book from Lewis Moronta very soon!!!"
4,Review,This logic liftoff resource book is most helpful. My students certainly enjoy the logic activities. I would recommend this resource book to others.
4,History,Another great book to add to your history collection in terms of cultural areas. Its a general book for Ojibway spirituality.
3,The Terrorist,"This book was better than I was expecting. The plot was decent, but rather predictable. Unfortunately, the main character, Laura Williams, was not exactly likable--ignorant, spoiled, and shallow. The other characters were rather sketchy but had the beginnings of being interesting. An international setting helped to enhance the book."
4,GREAT BOOK,i could not put the book down. It was a great book. It was very exciting.the only thing was the end was dissapointing----i was so excited trying to figure out who did it...but it never tells you at the end!!!---otherwise it ws really good
3,Wrong impression,"Dear fellow people, I would like to bring your attention to the fact that this book although thought to be good, conveys a wrong impression of Islam to non-muslims. The true religion does not support terrorism or ill-treatment of women. I am speaking on behalf a large number of muslims who just want you to know that our true religion is one of peace and tranquility. -thank you"
1,Islamophobia,"The writer is clearly determined to demonize and raise suspicions about people of Middle Eastern origin,the religion of Islam and Pacific Islanders. Definetly not recommended reading as the book teaches religious and social intolerance."
1,Why the West Encourages Stereotyping,"It doesn't surprise me the book stereotypes Muslims as terrorists. Why didn't this author know anything about Muslims, Islam, and the Middle East but terrorism? Is it ignorance? Or is it hiding facts that would change the worlds view about Muslims and Islam as a system? Islam teaches us that if we are to say something it is to be useful or to not say it at all. What this book does is nothing but creates hatred, misguidence, misinformation, and spreading lies about Islam. Fiction or not, it doesnt serve humanity in any way. The only ones served are the enemies of humanity! Don't let your kids get their hands on this book!"
2,I didn't really enjoy it,"This book was very discriminating against the Muslim religion and it sounded like Americans are supposed to be the top race in the world, but at the same time they are also naive in other people's eyes, at least in ""The Terrorist"". I did not like the way the book was written. It was confusing and lacked detail. It was pretty unrealistic when it came to students with mixed races. I myself go to an international school, although not quite as international as LIA (the school Laura and Billy went to), and you have friends no matter what country you're from, and nobody criticizes you the way the kids criticized each other in this book. I didn't much enjoy this at all, and I'm not exactly planning to buy any more of Ms. Cooney's books if all of them are going to be written in the same weird style."
4,awakening,"The book tells the story of one American girl's stay at a school in London and how a terrorist bombing affects her life. Prior to the bombing, her biggest concern was the next school dance. After, she finds how important it is to understand world events and how her new suspicion of all foriegners taints her good judgement...almost fatally. This book was a quick read. I picked it up intending to read a few pages, but couldn't put it down until I was half way through. Some might find the journey this young girl takes to be disturbing, but the book is age-level appropriate for 7-9th grade, and deals with serious issues like death, trust, fear, and cross cultural mis-conceptions."
1,UGH...Disgusting,"All I need to say about this book is that it is gross and the wrong persective of Muslims around the world! Well, DUH... there are good and bad people everywhere and this book makes it look like ALL Muslims are bad -- WRONG -- This book is stupid, it shows how ignorant Caroline B. Cooney is. I hate this book and I dont understand how people can read it and STILL like and BELIEVE it! Dont even bother to read this book!"
1,Disgusting and very stereotypical,"I cannot believe that this book is on its way to middle school students whom lack the choice in reading material. Hence, affecting their ""train of thought"" and embedding the stereotype of how Islam is NOT. This is absolutely outrageous. I'd like to see the same book written towards a specific church. Towards a Baptist church, for instance (nothing against them, just an example). Just imagine ..."
1,a terrible raceist book that should never be published,this is the worst book I ever read and I encourage people never to read this disgusting styreotepical raceist book that is a terrible think that would be givin to children to read if there was a lesser rating I would give that to it. I can't belive Caroline B. Cooney would be so raceist as to write this terrible book and I am disgusted with such a terrible writer who would write something like this and I would never read any of her books just because I read this book which deserves to be burned.
5,awesome book!,"I bought this book last year, and I'm syill reading it. It is a fabulous book and it keeps you're attention till the end. The most interesting part was how other people in the world view americans. I suppose I was totally ignorant in thinking that other nationalities bow down to us. But I totally recommend this book and I think everyone should read it!"
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read,I really didn't like this book. I think it is to hard to get into it and to understand what is happening because it mixes all around. It just isn't one of those books that you just can't put down.
1,Disappointing,"Clooney's use of the English language is more than acceptable, but it is evident that she knows next to nothing about the Middle East, Islam or even terrorists. Any book which reinforces ignorance in such a manner can not be recommended, especially for children."
4,A Great Thriller!,"When her brother is killed in a London subway bombing, American highschooler Laura becomes obsessed with finding her brother's murderer and starts to question and suspect all of her friends at school. When Laura's friend devises a plan that supposedly will help them both, Laura puts both her life and her relationship with her parents and friends in jeopardy. Has her brother's killer been under her nose the whole time? Read this suspenseful novel and find out!"
4,Get ready for a ride,Caroline Cooney has once again shown her nack for suspense. Right from the start she grabed my attention with the horrible death of Billy Williams. The death of a sibling just scares me inside knowing that that all of this could really happen. After the incident Billy's sister Laura vows to find his killer. The book than continues with schemes of fear and betrayal. I really recommend this book to anyone wanting to move over seas. It will definitely open your eyes.
4,The Terrorist,"This is a really really good book. It's kind of scary at first to realize that this could actually happen to anybody. Caroline B. Cooney wrote this book very well. It gives a really good perspective on World Peace. After reading this book I reccomended it to everyone I knew and they all agreed with me... this book is one of the best books I've ever read. And it also made me want to read more of Caroline B. Cooney's books such as... Driver's Ed, The Face on the Milk Carton, Whatever Happened to Janie, The Voice on the Radio, and What Janie Found... which all were very good."
1,The Terrorist is a bad book,This book isnt even interesting. I got half way through the book and through it down. I would rather read the encyclopedia then this book!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont even think about reading this book!!!!!!!!!! Caroline B Cooney is a good author but not on this one. So if you see it dont even bother picking it up.
1,This book was not the bomb,"I never liked any of her work. I started reading ""The Face On the Milkcarton"" and was really disqusted at it. Then I thought I should try reading another one of her books. mistake!!! This book is not thought out very well. The main charactor is as lightheaded as a balloon. And to top it all of the ending is beyond beleivable!"
5,The Search of Revenge,"Billy, a 10 year old boy that used to live in Massachusetts now living in London, dies from a bomb handed to him by an unkown terrorist. His parents and his older teenage sister, Laura are shocked by this news. Afterward, Laura starts stalking people(mostly from her highschool), trying to find out who killed her inocent baby brother. Every body sugests that theymove back to the United States where they are safe, but the family wants to be as close to Billy as possible. All the kids at school think Laura is a luatic, but every time, she feels that she's getting closer and closer to figuring out the unsolved case. Thruoghout the book, you think you know who it is, but your wrong. I would recomend this book for any body who likes, adventure, some action,and a bunch of mystery and drama. Have fun reading it!:)"
4,An interesting book,"The Terrorist is a book about a girl named Laura who is trying to figure out who killed her little brother and why. He was killed by a package bomb given to him by a stranger in the subway station. Laura is commited to find out who is responsible for Billys death and wants a reason for it. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in mystery books. This is a book that will not take long to get interested in, and once you start you wont be able to put it down."
3,It was pretty good!,This book was entertaining and the plot was suspenseful but theconclusion was very predictable. Still Cooney is a good author.
5,The Terrorist,I think that The Terrorist is great book.If any one asked me to recomend a book It would be The Terrorist or any of Caroline Cooney's books.The Terrorist is a spine chilling book it also keeps you on the edge of your seatI have read alot of Caroline's books and this is my favorit by far.It is about a boy who was involved in a terrorist act but he did not help the terrorist he was the one who died.This book shows how a family copes with the death of a child.
5,The Terrorist by Caroline B. Cooney,"The Terrorist by Caroline B. Cooney is a thriller. When 11year old Billy Williams is killed by a terrorist bomb, the family is never the same, and Laura is determined to find his killer. Everyone is a suspect. Will Laura find Billy's killer or will his killer find her.I loved this book and recommend it to anyone who likes to read. This is one of Cooneys best. This is a great book because Cooney puts you into the mind of Laura and gives the Laura's perspective."
5,The Best in Comics is still George Herriman,"This man must have been an inspired visionary genius. HIs comics are an abundance of true brilliance. It seems that most other cartoonists of his time were busy imitating his style. This work is still fresh and innovating, half a century and more later. This book is a must-read. Please buy it, it is truly more than food for thought. it will touch your very spirit."
2,Bad puzzle,"I agree with the other reviewers. The puzzle has pieces that fit in multiple places, and the pieces do begin to tear/fray. We were very disappointed in the quality of this puzzle & definitely would not buy another one from the same maker."
2,just ok,Don't put it to microwave! now I have only 3 of them... They are just a little boring but look fine.
3,OK... but not classy.,"I ordered these bowls hoping they had the same classy look as the Bormioli glasses I ordered last year. They don't. Ho-hum design at best. Had I seen them before purchase, I would not have purchased them. However, they are good enough to keep."
2,Great logo but....,"I don't like this mouse pad as a mouse pad. It does not grip the desk top so it slides around when I'm moving the mouse. Plus, while it works, I don't like the way the mouse moves across the surface--I prefer a bit more resistance. This feels like I don't even have a pad and am using the desk top instead. I'll be replacing it as soon as I find another with my school's logo on it."
3,Too Thin,This mouse pad is very thin and without any padding. It has a sticky back that doesn't work very well. It doesn't stay in place very well. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone.
3,Not bad but what about the second story line??,"It is not one of the best books ever written, but definitely good for reading on a rainy day... The story is ok, and I quite liked the characters; the hero was fabulous whereas the heroine was pretty and smart but a bit spiritless and whiney. What I really found annoying was that the other characters, Emma and Richard Du Quesne, didn't come together but were hardly mentioned. I think there was great potential in it, as they really matched, but for some reason Miss Bredan chose not to use it!"
4,"Complete, but many errors","Excellent collection of solitaire games. Unfortunately, there are also quit a few errors. This includes discrepancies between the text and illustrations, and in some cases, the rules a simply too vague, making it impossible to play the solitaire. Despite these flaws, this book contains a lot of gems and is well worth the price."
2,Disappointing but for the money they are decent,they sound worse then the stock speakers in my 02 Caviler. I had them powered by a US Amps 4 Channel 800w amp. The bass was lacking greatly and the sound quality wasn't very good but wasn't the worst i have heard.For the money they are a decent speaker but don't get your expectations up to high.
3,Watchable...,"Sweet, predictable. Clean & refreshing...unlike Hollywood filth we see too often. Why do these reviews have a minimum number of words? I had nothing more to say."
4,Nice Family Choice,"It was nice to have a movie with good values. It was not the best acting, but the story line was refreshing."
5,Loved this!,Such a good romance. I could watch this over and over again. It contrasted true love with a shallow infatuation in a very enjoyable movie.
4,Belle and the BeastI,"I thought this was a very cute movie. The characters where good for a modern day twist to the Beauty and the Beast story. It is really nice to see that movies can be made to be entertaining without having bad language or nudity in it. Anyway, it's very cute and worth watching!"
2,Simple Minded.,"Maybe two stars is unfair, because this is a fairy tale. It is a Christian movie, which is fine. However, the script is too nice-nice. The handsome beast is a jerk, of course, but to an unexplainable level. I was disappointed. I thought an adult fairy tale would deliver more complexity. The acting is merely adequate."
5,Good clean Christian film,So nice to watch a film that I can view comfortably with my teenage daughter. Great message and decent acting too.
4,Modern Day Beauty and the Beast,"I gave this movie 4 starts simply because it was clean and it could be watched with anyone in the room. The scenery was pretty, the story classic, but of course the acting and lines were wanting more depth, passion and humor."
1,Total Trash,"This flick is terrible. It's cheap Christian cinema. Terrible, unprofessional acting from the getgo. I think the people who produced it and acted in it wrote the good reviews."
1,"Worst acting, worst writing, worst plot ...","I expected this movie to be a little shy of Oscar quality, but it was actually horrifyingly bad. The acting was SO bad that I could not stop watching. And the dialogue was ridiculous. I think it hit its low point when Eric tells Belle about the horrors of being trapped in a car with his dead wife, praying for her to be alive but knowing she was not. Belle's response: ""Some times bad things happen to good people."" Eric didn't even blink. He should have thrown her in the lake. THAT would have improved the movie a lot.If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I'm a big fan of sappy Christian romance movies that you might see on the Hallmark Channel. This movie makes those Hallmark movies look like a Meryl Streep/Robert Deniro Oscar-winning blockbuster by comparison."
1,Misleading . . .,"Ironic, this ""Christian"" movie (dishonestly) doesn't give you a clue that it is a religious-based / Christian-based story in the advertisement - after paying, and clicking ""start"", within 30 seconds, you know that Belle is a good, hardworking, generous ""Christian?"" girl. Felt like brainwashing. I don't object to the movie, just how it represents itself. If you want this fine. But you should have the option to choose, prior to payment. I'm sure people w/be offended if another religion did this."
1,Sadly boaring,"boaring, dull and had a hard time finishing movie. Great movie if you want to do something else and need some noise."
1,Predictable,"This movie has predictable plots and dialogue. The acting is bad. It is not worth the money, there are much better christian romances available like One Night with the King."
4,belle and the beast,I truly enjoyed the story line. It was inspirational and real life. It was a story about second chances and forgiveness. It taught you not to be so quick to gossip and be judgmental. You should get to the facts and find out who a person is versus what you have heard. Sometimes what appears real is not the truth. Find truth and you find the person.
1,Off,I did not get to watch this due to the audio and video was not in sinc so I watched something else.
5,New Music For New Millenium,"This CD sounds pretty much like Karl Jenikns Adiemus but it is softened and more relaxing. If you like Enigma or Enya you will see that they, made groundbreaking steps for music like this wich surpasses them in all dimensions. Simply this is what they were spelling from the horizon. But do not think that it is somtging revolutionary, it looks like folk music of 21 century.Cerating the very same feeling gregorina chants do. Relaxing."
4,A Proven Master Falls Barely Short,"I have waited for _Anthem_ to be released for nearly two years. I bought _Solas_ and was hooked. My wife introduced me to the collaborative work Mr. Hardiman did with Michael Flatley. That was enough to tide me over until I got my hot little hands on this CD. Overall, it's a wonderful piece and the songs stand up to inspection alone or as a whole. But ... it's not _Solas_. I love the more relaxed feel that _Anthem_ has, and the comparisons made in other reviews to Hardiman's work sounding like 'Enya' meets 'Enigma' is perfect. I suppose I'm just more of an 'uptempo' Hardiman fan. I do heartily recommend this album to anyone who likes the Celtic genre -- of *any* stripe. Ronan is a genius, and whether writing dance music or slow flowing scores, he has captured the essence of what it is to be Celt."
3,it's okay,"With all the high hope I generated from the reviews I read here about this album, I play the CD as soon as I got it. And... I think the CD won't be played very often ( I might just convert track 2 to MP3). I found this album just above the ""so so"" level. All the tracks are sound the same, keyboard playing is just one handed, same type of rhythm through out the entire CD, constant repeats heard every where. Don't get me wrong, I believe the style of the musician should be the same, but not every piece of song. The vocal is beautiful, but it makes the CD sounds too much like Enya's music. Someone said this album combines the style of Enya and Enigma, I...don't think so, it's pretty much just Enya style.I won't recommend getting this CD. Sorry, it could be just my taste, however I DO know good music when I hear one."
5,Bruce Lee & JUDO Gene LeBELL,I ordered this disc in hope of seeing a half way decent production. Well I can tell you it is GREAT!A perfect dub of the three TV episodes by Bruce Lee after his first acticg stint as KATO in the GREEN HORNET from 1966.Bruce holds his own as an actor in these episodes. In the Ironside episode you not only get to see Bruce doing a nice acting job but a bit of judo with Judo Gene LeBell who taught Bruce grappling art of judo. All in I think this is a must for any Bruce Lee fan. It is just a shame Bruce was ripped off for the KUNG FU TV series.
2,Preaching Fred Craddock,It is a good book . He i s a little long winded and it takes him a while to get to the point
1,Requested replacement,"Cd had a severe scatch, about an inch. Unable to play. Provider says they'' get in touch. We'll see when they get in tojuch."
4,lot of innovative moves,"Having previewed this DVD I am struck by several things: first, I do not think I've ever seen more innovative moves or variations than on this DVD. she had a new twist on just about every familiar move.Second, this workout was different in that she rarely, if ever, requires 12 reps. She just keeps moving quickly through a variety of exercises for one body part.Third, speaking of the upper body workout, she only uses one pair of weights for all of the exercises, except for doubling up on one. I am used to using different weights for various exercises. For example I would use 10 lbs for biceps and 5 lbs for shoulders, but it's all the same here. Maybe it's OK to use just one set of weights for exerything considering how fast she moves between exercises."
5,Denise Austin 10 five minute target toners,"Once again another great workout routine. She is so good in this one. Easy to follow, very do-able. Loved this one."
5,Excellent form of Excerise,Great Fast intense Workout will most Definitely help lose weight an keep off with a proper diet...A+++
3,Good but difficult,I liked the idea of doing five minute intervals of different muscle groups but some of these moves are insane! I'm not in bad shape but I'm just not able to do some of what she is asking. I'd rather do a full workout that is going to work for me than to stumble through a few intense moves. She makes you work for those five mintues which is why I still rated it a three. I can see the benefit of what she is asking and it gives me a goal to work toward but this is not for beginners by any means.
5,Great DVD!,"I would highly recommend Denise Austin's Hit the Spot five minute workout DVD. The ability to choose your own workout is great. Exercises are low impact, yet effective."
5,Loved It!,"I really really love this workout dvd. It is by far one of the best! I work full time, go to school full time, have a husband and a baby boy and not a lot of time so it is perfect!"
5,Great workout,"Great workout, I like that you can pick which areas you want to work on each day. The workouts are short, but she makes you work hard. Great for all levels because you can change how heavy your weights are."
4,10 Target Toner,"I like the fact the it is targeted toward people on tight schedules. You can set the CD to targer a particular area of your body and yes, you can do it in about 5 minutes. You can continue for the full 20 or 30 minutes and stop or just do what you have time to do."
4,Exellent instruction,Unlike some of Denise's other dvd's this one has excellent instruction and encouragement. Not like the old Denise workouts where she is practically shouting at you. I use this dvd on easy days when I don't feel up to pushing myself and I still feel like I had an adequate workout depending on the weight I've used.
4,Consistently good,This is a great DVD. The only thing is that she indicates you can set bookmarks for sections you like. I couldn't figure out how to do that on the Kindle????
2,Uninteresting and completely unbelievable,"In medieval France, every noble from the King and Queen on down alternates endless sexual antics with declaring war on each other, with some occasional devil worship thrown in.History as excuse for ""romance""/sex. I don't know how accurate the historical portrayals are, but I have trouble believing they could be close, especially with all the devil worship. In any case, the thin excuse of a plot was tedious and I didn't even make it a quarter of the way through before giving up."
5,History Revisited,"This book is like no other I have read. It entwines history with spirituality and is so accurately researched one might wonder why it wasn't used in history class. This book has changed my life! It has given me a whole new outlook on everything and everyone. I am planning my journey to France, which will no doubt be a life-changing experience! The gilt-edged paperback cover might throw some readers off as to the content, but don't let that stop you. This is no typical romance novel. This book is a true heart-gripping historical masterpiece from the first page until the very last, and will have you thinking about it for a very long time afterwards!"
2,potty mouth Passover,"I didn't like this as much as I thought I would. I liked the idea of some of the stories (the mother is always upset), but I found the frequent usage of the eff word distracting. I don't think that usage of profanity should be banned from books, but how many times is it necessary to tells someone to eff off at a Bris, or a Seder?The dialogues seemed contrived and unconvincing. I read the entire book hoping to find a story that would justify the purchase price; I was unable to do so. I really felt sorry for the characters who found themselves in these stories, but hopefully they are fictional and will not need to read their portraits.However, if you like to read details about yeast infections and graphic accounts of vaginal itch, this may be the book for you."
4,Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover...,"This book was a selection from my temple's book club...did not know what to expect when I heard the title and was uttertly surprised once I cracked the cover and starting reading it...not exactly your zadie's fiction! Ms. Albert definitely has a gift with the pen, but while her recurring somewhat-sexually-repressed-Jewish-woman-in-quotidian-situation is written with some wit, the stories grow quickly tired and are reminiscent of a Larry David ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" episode or a ""Sex in the City"" episode peppered with a bit of Judaica. Nevertheless, it's entertaining to read about 30-something women live life and be Jewish. Curious how the novel she is working on will read...Mazel Tov!"
1,"I really didn't enjoy it, but...","I can see how more literary readers would. I thought that it tried too hard to be shocking and edgy--I found it more bitter and morose. However, I think Elisa Albert has a strong passion for her work and I will give her writing another try. Looking forward to it."
5,A Instant Fascinating Jewish Classic,"Elisa Albert writes from the heart with humor and wit. An instantly classic book, silly, humorous, always fun. Highly recommended."
4,Painfully funny,"Elisa Albert's observations are painfully funny...I cringed even as I was giggling out loud while I read her nicely written prose. Not for the faint-of-heart, though; these stories offer unique insights into modern American Jewish life...!"
5,This was perfect for what I wanted it for.,"It's not the most amazing piece of jewelery ever made but it was exactly what I was looking for. A little while back I read about this Greek Myth. This small fish was so strong that it could stop a ship from moving and when worn as a pendant by pregnant women it would protect them in pregnancy. It would stop them from having a miscarriage. Anyway, I liked the myth and I wanted to remember it so if I knew anyone who became pregnant I could give it to them as a congratulations present. This neckless was the perfect representation of the myth. It's not too expensive and the fish is nice looking and not heavy. When the fish got to my house a wished on it to give her a good and safe pregnancy and guess what!?! She pretty much had no morning sickness and is past the three month mark with no complications so far!"
5,music video galore!!!,An awesome collection of music videos...most of them you can't get anywhere else! The whole list is as followed:Concrete Blonde - Heal It UpDead Can Dance - YulungaEve's Plum - BlueThe Posies - Definite DoorThe Thrill Kill Kult - Blue BuddhaRedd Kross - Jimmy's FantasyScreaming Trees - ButterflySpin Doctors - Jimmy Olsen's BluesSuede - The DrownersThe Wonder Stuff - On The Ropes
3,For all Witches who are Healers,"This is a great book for all those witches who would like to learn or enhance their healing arts. Loaded with lots of ideas, charts, and extra info about healing from many aspects of the occult."
5,DHC Live: What a Live Record Should Be.,"If you're a Dance Hall Crashers fan this will be a slice of heaven. If you're new to them... well,it'll still be a slice of heaven but an informative one,because this record samples all of the DHC albums,giving the listener a good taste of past and present.Since many of the songs are edgier and faster than the studio tracks at times (most of the time actually) I enjoyed them even more than the studio recordings.The occasional short exchanges between the extraordinary vocalists Karina and Elyse are quiet funny and to the point.I'd point out standout tracks but all 25 from the fast 'We Owe' to slow and moving 'Cricket' are great.This is the best live record I've heard and it should be in any ska/punk-pop fans collection."
4,really good,"usually live albums arent really good but i loved this. i felt like i was at the actual concert and all the songs were so energetic and fun. even tho i thought this was good i made all my friends listen to it and no one liked it. pshhh, people these days have no appreciation for quality music."
2,Blech.,"There should be some sort of rubric for a band to warrant a live CD. Too damn many are being put out nowadays in a market where the official live CD [especially in punk rock] used to be rare. As I listen to 70 minutes of dual-female vocalized punk/ska, Fat Wreck style [there's your summary, kids], I ponder: why do the Dance Hall Crashers need a live CD? They're not breaking/broken up. The songs aren't varied at all from their original recordings [at least the ones that I have heard before, which are about half]. This isn't a benefit for anything/anyone. So why? I mean, DHC is alright, and I'm sure they're nice people. But unless the live CD is marking a special occasion [i.e. Cheap Trick's ""Music For Hangovers"" or Braid's ""Lucky To Be Alive' {both recorded at the same place, might I add}], keep it under wraps. And if you ska kids REALLY want a live ska CD, check out the new Slackers CD, it's great."
1,"Pick the diorama, drop everything else","I bought this becuase I wanted the diorama, the background and I wanted uncle Owen as there is no other version of him (not that I know). Action figures that come with this pack are not poseable, and they just move like the old vintage action figures of the 1980s, and they come in awful poses. Luke can't stand up outside of the diorama. Uncle Owen needs to bend forward to stay up outside of the diorama. C-3PO has a zombie face as if it was an undead robot from a scrap yard.I bought it since I had some Jawas, R2-D2, R5-D4, C-3PO and Luke. If I wanted Luke and C-3PO I would go and look somewhere else."
4,good collection for the new abba fan,"fernando was a cool cut, but my favorite song by them is dancing queen. i dig that catchy groove and the vocals are cool. abba had there own vibe and sound and there songs still hold up real well to me. this is a good guide for a new fan getting into abba."
5,Sweet sounds from a super group.,"Abba is one of the few music groups who's music is always in fashion. There is not a ""sour"""" note on the whole CD. Abba lives and this CD proves it!"
5,love their music,"Always loved ABBA. Even though this has nothing to do with jazz, my favorite music, bar none, there is always room for Abba!ABBA forever! What voices!"
4,Great For Casual Fans,"This is definitely a good CD for people who are casual fans of Abba and looking for the essentials. The hits are here *although the sound quality could be better.* Of course, you get the ever-so-famous ""Dancing Queen."" Everyone knows this song. You also get many of their other great songs including two of my personal favorites ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" and ""Take A Chance On Me."" Plus one of the best songs of their career ""The Winner Takes It All."" My complaint would be that I would rather have seen them take off one of the lesser songs and put on ""Lay All Your Love On Me"" but oh well.If you are looking for a little more, I recommend the ""Gold"" collection. Definitely worth a few extra bucks."
4,lots of fun..he plays for hours,My 6 year old son got this for Christmas and has had no problem with it coming apart. Every now and then a sail or flag will be pulled off by the younger ones (4 and 2) but he can put them back on himself. I waited until he was six because of the other reviews that it falls apart and I think that helped. I also put up some of the smallest peices but not all. Maybe when he is a bit older and the other kids are too.
4,Pirateships,"Not a bad product compared to some of the other pirate ships I have purchased...Others, come apart and are useless withing a day or two after the child plays with it...this pirate ship is alittle more solid but still has pieces that come off continually and you have to keep gathering them up and putting the ship back together...Pirates come apart..arms and heads...not good for small children."
1,Pain in the butt!!,"Several of the pieces don't fit together properly and the directions are lousy. I've bought similar sets from a different brand and I've had no problem at all with assembly. This is the only christmas gift I regret buying now, my son will enjoy the others much more."
3,If you buy this toy.......,If you buy this toy for Christmas DO NOT open the box before you are ready to spend a big chunk of time assembling it. I gave the ship to my 6 year old last Christmas and it was out of the box before I knew it. The pieces ending up all over the place and the ship never got assembled. When we finally did get at least part of the ship together I found that it didn't stay together that well when played with. My three kids are all huge playmobile fans but if I bought this again I would glue everything together when putting it together.
3,Too many pieces,"Our 5-year old grandson was thrilled when he opened this gift. But the number of pieces, combined with the complexity of the assembly required the efforts of both grandfather and father. Actually, this was a good thing - the intergenerational sharing of a task. The toy seems sturdy and could inspire lots of creative activity, but the the pieces are numerous and small and sure to get lost."
4,sharp and precise,These are well made and sharp. A person has to be carefull since blades are long and have sharp edges.
1,They don't cut!,"These are toenail pliers, not cutters. They won't cut! You've got to twist the toenail over and over like breaking wire with pliers. Stay away!"
5,Just what I wanted for my thick toenails.,"My toenails have thickened as I have aged, and the standard toenail clippers no longer will handle the load. But these babies handle the job with ease. The angled cutter works perfectly, and clips accurately with little effort. I think I will order some more for a gift for others."
1,Do not even bother with it !,"This is a cheaply made ripoff of otherwise great toenail clipper. Pakistani made, advertised as 'surgical steel', has been filed by hand with visible defects on every surface. It is so dull, it does not cut toenails at all, but only tears them, presuming that one has enough strength in the hand to do it. Even though return postage most likely equals the value of the apparatus, I return it promptly as a matter of principle. Folks, do not be fooled. This tool is a ripoff. I wish there would be a minus 3 (-3) star rating."
2,The Grief Recovery Handbook,"This book was a little disappointing because it tried to cover too many areas of loss and didn't cover any one adequately. I was looking for a book to help me counsel a widower over the death of his spouse. Some of the suggested activities required a ""partner"" to process and talk with and didn't offer methods for an individual to process and journal their grief alone. The book is not suitable for the grieving person to go through alone. It requires someone to take them through it."
5,Essential reading and integration into everyday life.,"After losing a friend to suicide I discovered the Grief Recovery Institute. I ordered the book, read it, practiced the exercises and enrolled in the certification program. It has changed my life in profound ways. It is the single most important action plan I have ever encountered."
5,A Necessity,This is an incredible book that helps you to process your losses. This is great for anybody. It should be a requirement for all helping professionals to understand how to be the best support to those who you will be assisting.
5,The Grief Recovery Handbook,Work at your own pace alone or with someone to help. It is really an action program and I feel that when I am done my grief will not be unresolved so I will move ahead stronger. Also this is a great gift for the grieving and to help someone else .
4,Wonderful Book,I bought this book at the recommendation of my counselor after a complicated divorce. It has been very helpful so far.
2,Not Helpful to Me,"I have read other books on grief and this one is not as good as any of the others I've read. It puts down some of the theories of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross who has written many wonderful books on grief. Some of the statements in it are so simplistic that they sound stupid. The book puts down the ""denial"" aspect of grief by saying that none of the people they interviewed ever denied that their loved one had died. That's not what the ""denial"" step is about. It's about saying ""This can't be happening to me"" or ""I must be having a nightmare,"" when faced with the loss of a loved one. I would appreciate the book more if they just said the book contains their beliefs about getting through grief and not that what they think is the gospel and what anyone else has written is wrong. I'm also reading a book, Transcending Loss, by Ashley Davis Bush who is a therapist and grief counselor and am finding it much more relevant and beneficial to getting through grief."
4,Grief Recovery Handbook,"This book is a lifesaver. It leads you through action steps for correct and right choices in participating in your own grief recovery. I highly recommend reading and doing the ""work"" that is suggested. Healing a broken heart is possible!The authors take this book a step further than their previous book, by adding ""intangible"" losses such as faith, miscarriage, health, etc. which is extremely important."
4,It works,"Yes this book has a big focus on working with a partner, but there's a erason for that: it works. Processing emotions works better when you're doing it with another person. It isn't as easy to do, but the book is still useful and it can still be effective when done alone."
4,Very Good Book.,I'm only half way through this book but It's wonderful. A book everyone should read at some point in there life.
1,Waste of time,"I tried to read this book on the well iintended advice of a close friend. While it may have been well intended, I really didn't have the patience or the desire to endure the protracted sales pitch about what a great book this is for several chapters, followed by the redundant sad rambling stories of the authors lives. While I do agree we tend to repress the correct emotional response to loss and medicate ourselves into a state of apathy, the rest of the book and the exercises were just too dramatic and unrealistic in their benefit. To sum the process with ""write a letter saying how sorry you feel"".. well why not just say that up front and be done with it. To top it off with a sales pitch of the grief products was just a disappointment. basically ""We'll fix your lifetime of grief for 12.99""... not really, but we'll make 12.99 and feed you some worn out psychobabble."
2,Read the reviews,"We purchased this book based on a recommendation that although it talked about divorce and death, the process was helpful for other losses as well. You need to be able to plow through A LOT of repetition about divorce and death to see that. I am a very open reader and can see past the obvious, but this one was even tough for me. If the authors are serious about using the book for other losses, then create a book that focuses in as much detail, and with as many examples, as the death and divorce events in this one."
2,"Not bad, Not good",I felt that they rushed you through the process. I am farther along in my grief recovery so it do bother me that much. But if your loss is still fresh I do not recommend this book. Find a therapist and work through some thing then buy the book.
3,Be where you are and be where you're going.,"This is a non-threatening user-friendly book that helps the reader both understand the experience of grief and find ways to recover from its impact.Sydney Metrick, PhD--Author of Crossing the Bridge: Creating Ceremonies for Grieving and Healing from Life's Losses"
3,Grief of Spilt Milk and Lost Keys,The grief of divorce and the grief of death are completely different. Hinting that they are similar is hurful to those that go through the pain.I have a faith of an afterlife and would much rather have had my wife die. I would better savor the great memories of the past with a hope to see her again someday (however misguided if there is none).Missing someone who loves you is DEATH. Your lover turning traitor and assassin is DIVORCE. These are very different griefs to overcome.Can I also apply this book to the grief of a burned-down house (no insurance) and lost memoirs?
5,The Grief Recovery Book,"This book does what the title promises, gives instruction and plan for working through grief. It is not a religious book, rather about the mechanical details, the ups and downs. It makes you realize others have survived grief in a healthy way and so can I. Thanks"
4,A Great Book for Moving Beyond Grief,"This book is a great book for those who are grieving any type of loss. I recently lost my husband, and this book offered me insights into the grieving process and how to move beyond it."
2,"Repetitious, not a lot to offer other than their technique","I expected more from this book, based on the reviews and the description.Having been through a few sudden deaths of people close to me, and some other major life events, I found the author's techniques to be more than a bit lacking. But as they say, everyone's experience is different. Glad to see that it helped some people, but there were many, many omissions and oversights in terms of ways to deal with both traumatic and predictable events - past, current or future - and how you let them effect you as you move forward.(They only briefly touch upon that concept.) That's the difference between growing from experiences - and getting stuck. This book really only speaks to those who have gotten stuck.All in all, a much better book on all of this is Scott Peck's The Road Less Traveled."
5,"The Grief Recovery Handbook, 20th Anniversay Expanded Edition","I'm a psychologist and have used this when trying to deal with grief. But it's also just as good for loss of relationships too. I think it's a great work book for guidance / structuring of letter writing to the person you have lost. I't quick reading and if you stick with it, you can get thru the process in a few days. This book really helped me!"
5,Very good and popular resource... (review by personal coach),"This book is an excellent resource for those who are grieving any kind of loss. It provides an action plan that is gentle and provides direction during a difficult, confusing and often disorienting time. I have used this resource with my clients and I know many other therapists who regard it highly and use it in their practices. If you get this, I would also recommend the classicOn Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss. After a big loss of any kind, I think it is very important to take action, but also make sense of the loss. Both resources I mention in this review will help with making meaning out of the loss and getting reoriented."
3,small,"This tea set was smaller than I was expecting. I ordered a different tea set for my daughter at Christmas, and it was a small one, but a perfect size for her. We ordered this one, to have at Grandma's house, but it's like half of the size of the one we got at Christmas. The cups are so small."
4,Great Tea set for beginners,"Tea set is great fun when painting with kids. It's much smaller than I imagined it would be though. Paint caps were a little hard to open. But, still great fun."
2,Beware!,"Purchased a similar model - KX-TX1460 series - in April 2003. Great clarity, good range. Happy all over. But, a scant 9 months later, the battery was dying. Panasonic customer service told me the expected battery life is 8-12 months.When the phone is $25, why spend $16 a year for a battery?I'm going elsewhere."
1,If the Shoe Fits,"I have sent several emails that I have not received this book, but I have not received any acknowledgements that Amazon is going to do something about it. There is no phone number to call and this has been one of the most frustrating experiences I have had in buying something over the Internet. I will never buy another book from Amazon again, there is no problem with Amazon in trying to sell books but when it comes to customer service there is none."
5,How fun!!,"My daughter (age 7) and I had so much fun reading this story of snow white, cinderella, sleeping beauty and rapunzel- the girls rocked! They fought back, had bad hair days, dealt with sorta normal issues and felt insecure, grumpy, and scared. Just like us! They fought hard, rose above the issues and became happy. That's the stuff!"
5,Splendid!,"Lesley Gore had the ability to hit every note and make us long for her insight into love's complexity. All are worthwhile, but ""Look of Love"" is the cream of the crop ""Here I stand, all by myself, watching him with someone else - bet he doesn't even know I'm here - wish I could hold back my tears ..."" is right on target. The Phil Spector-like arrangement is over the top and adds to this superior song. But really, ""She's a Fool"" and ""Maybe I Know"" are classics in their own right - well sung, well phrased and, well, just perfect. This is a must-have for anyone longing for the days where the most thorny problem we faced was ""who should I take to the sock hop."""
5,60s cutie lesley gore,i was very happy with this cd it had all of lesleys best songs and the music was crisp and clear if you collect music like i do pick up this cd its worth it i listen to mine often.
5,60's babe...............,"Leslie Gore was one of the best singers during my 60's growing up years. Her voice was rich and heartfelt. I would crank up my old box record player and put on her 45. I especially loved That's the Way Boys Are and even though I wasn't allowed a boyfriend I still had visions of what it would be like to even experience a broken teen heart over a boy. She gave me that vision and if I felt the tears coming, it wasn't because of my father's words, but hers. She and others like her were my teen idols and listening to their songs during those sad and bad childhood years in my father's house reminded me that I was just a teen after all and should be allowed to feel and act like one. Listening to her songs gave me those moments of peace and I thank her again for those 'just for me' memories. For me this CD deserves 8 Stars!!!"
3,Great 60s Songs - Album Should Be Longer,"This album contains all of Leslie Gore's top 40 songs and sounds great and I'm not sorry that I bought it. What would have been nice is if the album had more than 28 minutes of music. I know that the 20th Century Masters Series don't seem to have more than 12 songs on their albums, but when the artist's songs are generally around 2 minutes long you get minimum for your money. That said, all the songs that I wanted are here and I like the album."
4,LUV THE SONGS,"I was encouraged to write a review by those good people, so here goes. I personally love oldie songs, and I wasn't even around when they first came out. Anyway, I especially liked track 5: 'That's the Way Boys Are'. Of course, the lyrics aren't entirely true, but it's got a good beat to it. 'Judy's Turn to Cry' is a personal favorite of mine as well. It's great music, great songs, buy the CD."
1,Oh please stop!,"I didn't know she was still alive.I cannot fathom the appeal of such wretched, pointless songs. Why anyone would want to go back and listen this garbage again is beyond comprehension."
5,Great,This recording of Lesley Gore recording sound exactly like the original recordings. Bravo! I would recommend this CD for anyone who like Lesley Gore or the 60s.
3,The tips showing in the picture didn't come with the charger,"I received the charger. First it's all in black color. Looked not as good as it showed in the picture. Second, it only comes with the mini USB tip. In the picture, it shows 5 tips in total for different phones. But I only received 1 mini USB tip. Also, there's no LED light indicators. The first time I tried to connect the charger with 4 AA batteries to my iphone, it's not charging. Then I had to replace 4 AA batteries and it charged. Since there's no ON/OFF light showing on the charger, so you won't know if it's the AA battery's problem, the charger's problem or the phone's problem. Not worth the money. The product looked so cheap."
2,Warning - Too small!,"They look great, no doubt about that, but the size is much too small. I took a size larger than I usually wear in underwear, but they were still so small that the sem broke on the second use. Some mending, and they function again, but it was a disappointment. Not also that they are only leather in the front."
5,Simply the best! Farina has never been better...,"This CD was realeased around five years ago and still stands as one of the best mixed house cds ever. It is completely seamless, in fact if you set it to loop continusly, the beginning and the end mixes perfectly. This disc rarely leaves my player. It is only equaled by French Sessions Vol. 1 & Vol. 3. This cd really shows the skill and creativity of the Farina. He adds beautiful vocal samples from one of the tracks, throughout the mix, this small addition ties the whole disc together. Farina is truly a madman with a sampler. Buy this disc, support great artists and indie labels."
3,Mediocre-at best,"My expectations were for a ""Mushroom Jazz"" experience. What I got instead, was repetitive-cheap feeling music.Don't get this album unless you're a collector"
5,Just a second shy of excellent...still good Mark Farina,"This is an excellent cd by Mark Farina. I can say that I love each and every song, and I'm definitely feeling song #s 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 through 14. I also love his use of voices, the ocean handclaps, etc. This cd is NOT a WASTE of money, it is a good buy, and it works real well on my treadmill. :-)"
4,Good CD,"Funky tunes and nicely mixed but feels a bit unbalanced. Doesn't reach the level of 'Mark Farina - Live in Tokyo', so if you dont have that one then get it now!"
2,i didn't care for it,"This sounds like generic laid back funk more than electronic dance music ... didn't much care for it, sorry. Shoulda listened to the samples I guess."
4,slow moving and loathing,"This album is not for everyone. It's rather slow moving most of the time and some of the songs (The Golden Egg, The Star You Left Behind, A Fable With No Morale) fade forever into an instrumental. The attitude of Sam Coones could be a definite turn off. I suggest you download some of it before purchasing. I, on the other hand am not one of those people and enjoyed these aspects. Beautiful pop melodies, insightful lyrics, and the essence of Quasi completely hooked me. The only problem I truly have with the album besides a couple of duds (Don't Mean Nothing), is the way they arranged the songs. If the shifts had been better and a more effecient order, the album would go by much quicker and would seem much more cohesive. Instead, you get the feeling that the moaning and groaning of Sam Coones is never going to end. But most of the time - that's a good thing."
2,Boring,"Overall a very disappointing release, not so by the songs and the concept, but by the dated music Quasi is playing. We've heard it before, we'll hear it all again. This band does not break any new ground, it displays the ground sixties pop and nineties low fi once broke."
1,please print this review for others to read!,"i cant say enough bad things about this cd. it sucks. please dont waste your money like i did. super cheesy lyrics, bad guitar playing, bad vocals, everything is wrong here. and who is the 'tard who produced this crap? he needs a beatin'. go buy blink 182 instead and don't waste your money on imposters."
4,Very Good!,"Their 2nd Cd is better, but their newer CD is coming out in March 2003 and I've heard some of their new songs like Trademark, and Wits all been done before, but I would still recommend this one. This is the slower one, but it's worth it for track 2 alone!"
3,"""Even the band admits they hate it.""","When the band made their debut in 2000, you could hear the crickets chirp. The album was evidently written by teens, which is forgivable if you grew up in the 80's, but the rest of us didn't get it. Nancy Drew, Matchbox 20, Marilyn Manson, Back to the Future, Charles in Charge, and 17 Magazine--all referenced in the music--made focal points of the songs. While some are amusing and witty, ""`It's three a.m.,' she said. `Who are you Matchbox 20?'""Other references are irritating and utterly pointless. The vocals lack, and while glimpses of tune are visible, most are simply forgettable. ""Softer to Me"", the highlight is an edgy rock song that croons the plea, ""Life could you be a little softer to me. ... This world is hard, it's cruel, and I wish it could be ... softer to me.""Overall, the album is amusing to a degree, but it's juvenile, and this all but murders the album's good points. Even the band admits they hate it."
2,the second album's way better,"When I got this CD, I thought it was like really cool. I listenedto it at the CD store, and it ROCKED. Then a few weeks later, thelyrics were so tongue-in-cheek, so stupid. The only good song was""Softer to Me"". But overall, if you don't want something tongue-in-cheek, DON'T GET THIS!..."
3,"It's pop punk, but still good","Most pop punk bands to come out the last couple of years have sucked, especially those in the ""Christian market"". Relient K, however, actually might suprise you with this album. The sound is much heavier on the pop side and doesn't come off like a blatant MxPx rip-off. Some of these songs are awesome, such as ""My Girlfriend"" and ""Softer to Me"". However, where the album fails is in the juvenile, often unfunny, and very cliche lyrics. Many of the tracks, such as ""K Car"" and ""Nancy Drew"", are utterly stupid and bland. Overall, this is actually pretty good, being a debut and being marketed toward CCM youth group kids, and some of these songs are awesome."
3,Almost worth a listen,"Relient K's debut cd shows that the band has a lot ofpotential, but this cd isn't so hot. The lyrics are witty, but themusic isn't very interesting at all. Some of what goes wrong on this cd isn't the band's fault, it is just overproduced and too slick sounding. I wish the cd was a little bit more raw sounding."
3,RELIENT K ROCKS!! and this cd does too!!,"HEY GUYS!! RELIENT K's debut rocked like a goose....but it was lacking in some areas, but it still rocked. IF YOU LIKE POP punk this is a band for you, THEY ARE one of the best bands ever, AND THEY""RE CHRISTIAN!! They're really melodic punk, very poppish, but varies a lot in they're sound. This cd is one of those that you'll love some songs off of, but then a few of the others get kinda boring and dumb, so you start skipping them, but most of the songs rock. The highlights are ""Softer to me"",which shows they're hardest side, ""Charles in Charge"", ""wake up call"", and the ever so popular ""marilyn manson"". These guys have awesome music, but what really makes them is their VOCALS. There's a lot of good bands, but then their voice ruins them. BUT THESE GUYS ROCK!! SO GUYS.......if you like pop punk, GET THIS CD!! BUT THEY""RE new cd, the anatomy of the tongue in cheek IS EVEN BETTER!! but still get this, cuz its awesome!! SEYA!!"
5,"Hello, McFly!","Just a warning to anone who buys this, you will be laughing until your sides ache. Relient K takes bubble gum punk and mixes it with the funky style of Blink 182 to create absolutely hilarious songs that actually HAVE a point. Example lyric form ""Hello, McFly"":""Oh, I wish I was Michael J.

See what I mean? This is an awesome CD, so what are you waiting for? Buy it already!"
4,Pretty Cool CD,"Come on, how can you not love a band that does a cover of the ""Charles in Charge"" theme song? Relient K has a fresh sound similar to Blink 182 or ACE Troubleshooter. If you're a fan of punk, this cd is a good investment."
2,MLEH,"Don't get me wrong, Relient K is the best band ever in my opinion, but this is only their debut. Don't judge a band from the cover, check out their newer stuff beginning with MMHMM and I promise you will be amazed. Their 2nd and 3rd album are great as well. I don't know what I could do without songs like ""Pressing On"" ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"" ""Chapstick"" ""Moodring"" ""Forward Motion"" ""In Love With The 80's"" (they really can write some good stuff) but I can do without all the songs on this album and so can Relient K. Matt Thiessen blatantly asked people not to listen to this stuff because this is NOT who they are. They have grown up since this and so have the fans, so do yourself a favor and overlook this album but do NOT overlook the band."
5,This album ROCKS!!,"Relient K did an awesome job on this album. All the songs are catchy, and lots have a great message. The secular songs on this album are fun and still sometimes include references to God (like in Charles in Charge) I recommend this album to you if you like Blink 182 or American Hi-fi. Keep your eyes peeled for their new cd August 28!!!"
5,RELIENT K ROCKS FOR GOD,"I saw Relient K in concert in April '01 and had no idea who they were,after only hearing about 2 songs I loved the style and sound,so I bought the cd,at first i didn't like it and after having it on the shelf for about 3 months I started listening to it and they became my fav band!! Their lyrics are really good and if your a teen I can guarentee you will relate!! They will have a new cd out Aug.28th(The Anatomy of The Tounge and Cheek)I encourage you to purchase both!! AND KEEP JAMMIN 4 JESUS! In CHRIST,Gillian!"
4,A Good CD,"I really like what Relient K does for Christian PUNK RAWK. Their lyrics are great, and the music sounds awesome. They are similar to MxPx, Ghoti Hook, and a lot of other christian punk bands, this CD is definitly one to add to the collection"
1,"If you want punk by Christians, buy MxPx or Ghoti Hook","I really dislike this cd. The label may say its punk rock and roll, but the production is definitely pop. I guess if you like pop with a little bit of punk like Blink, you might like this. Also, all the pop culture references get old really quick. The artwork is a rip-off of The Get Up Kids' ""Four Minute Mile."" If you want good punk by Christians, stick with Ghoti Hook, MxPx, and Dogwood."
2,not the relient k i know,"This cd is NOTHING LIKE any of there other ones. I'm not a huge christian music fan (although i like Mxpx and fm static), but when this band put out ""two lefts don't make a right"" it totally changed my mind about this genre. I can't believe i waited for 2 weeks and paid 15 bucks for this junk. The vocals are bad, the songs are weak and if it didn't have the name relient k slapped across it, it would have been discontinued 3 years ago. I'm glad rk has become more mainstream with every newer album...and yes, i know it will make alot of people mad but this album is just TOO preachy. It ruins the music with overly sappy lyrics about jesus. I'd recommend anatomy (which is good but borderline too preachy) two lefts or mmhmm instead..."
1,wow,This CD is a joke. Seriously... it's awful. It's for people just starting to get into punk and rock. Use it to convert a friend from Britney Spears to rock and roll. Then *quickly* let them listen to other stuff so that they can say they discard it as the lousy mindless slush it is.
1,has to be some sort of joke...,"is this cd just a big act to get stuff like teen magazine, matchbox 20, staples, marilyn manson stuck in peoples heads gone wrong?! this cd really sucks... if this group would make up some of their own ideas rather than just taking from pop culture they could be great! they seem talented, but they sure arent showing it, give me a break. lol"
3,It is ok.,"I think a book accompanied with this might make it much better. He does not fully explain what he is doing. I guess he expects you to watch and mimic his motions. But one can mimic and get the motions wrong because they do not understand the concepts. Along with his short explanations he does give, they are very quick and not in depth. Good thing for DVD you can pause, rewind at a much better rate than VHS. If you decide to buy this, make sure to keep it basic for the beginning: maybe have another person nearby. I almost knocked myself out trying to do those breathing exercises. Not because they are bad, but because it does put some pressure on your body and lungs that are not normal to the average person that has not done these things before."
2,Get something else,"This GPS is nicely set up and isnt too hard to operate. The bad side is that there is no website support for the US and it has a tracking problem. This could have been the one I had, but when you stop, gps keeps flipping your position around as if you were rotating in a circle. When you take off it has to reacquire your position. This is a problem if you are in an area with a lot of streets where directions happen often. I would recommend getting another gps from another company."
1,I'd rather take a valium and stab my eyeballs out,"This movie is absurdly depressing. Maybe if you had some horrible event in your life this would make you feel like it wasn't so bad.I don't mind a sad movie but there needs to be some redemption, or hope, or something for christ sake. If you want an all star depressing weekend, watch this and million dollar baby, then maybe ""what dreams may come.""Jeeash. 4 star average?"
4,Perspective,"The boy-meets-girl formula can only take a film so far as it has been shot in every conceivable combination. I would have chosen someone different than Meg Ryan for the lead female, if only for a bit larger thrust to suspend belief in reality. Cage did a fine job of restraint, not overwhelming the poignant lines. This story captured my imagination with the scene where Dr. Rice is eating the pear, and Seth replies that he doesn't know how it tastes to her...I would recommend this video to those in need of a dose of the fairytale to ward of the burdens of reality for two hours."
1,A ho hum movie...wake me when it's over.,"This is one of those highly forgettable movies that two days after you've seen it, you can't recall much, if anything, about it. Basically, it's about some dreary, gloomy, joyless heavenly angels that live in a library, (it gets worse).This movie lost ALL credibility for me in an early scene when one of the angels (Cage) reveals himself to a doctor (Ryan) who doesn't know he's an angel. He then asks her what food tastes like. Without batting an eyelash, she answers him like this is an everyday normal question. I think he also asks her what an orange tastes like...like I said, it's hard to remember. I can not recall anything from that scene on, not even how it ends. The script in this movie is pitiful and Cage and Ryan are moronic throughout."
1,Please...,"Romantic, beautiful... what a bunch of ... This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. I like romantic movies. I like Meg Ryan. (""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""You've Got Mail"" were really good.) This movie I hated.I as I sat through this movie, I had an overwhelming feeling that I was being played. This movie was made for the sole purpose of making people cry. Not that it had a story to tell, just string together as many sad events as you can in two hours. It was heavy-handed and insulting. If you liked this movie, watch it again and then tell me the reason why....""Joe vs. the Volcano"" was a more romantic and beautiful movie than this, and it was just plain silly; but at least it didn't ask to be taken seriously."
1,two great actors one bad movie,"Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are fine actors who have made excellent films, so why they jumped aboard this is anyones guess. Meg Ryan is a doctor who loses a patient. Cage is the angel that takes the soul away. Ryan is beside herself with grief and anger, cage is puzzled at first by her reaction then as he visits more falls in love.It reminded me of the sort of film you would agree to go to on a first date. Lots of people will say there is a deep profound hidden message about vulnerability, love and the human spirit, but I just wanted to be entertained. PS Bad ending also."
1,"See ""Wings of Desire"" instead...","This is merely a pale remake of a beautiful German film from 1988 called ""Wings of Desire"". Like Roger Ebert once said, why remake a GOOD film? Remake a BAD film and make it good."
2,"Overrated, Sentimental, Boring, Predictable","Leave it to Hollywood to take a good cast (Cage, Ryan, Franz) and an interesting concept (How does it feel to be an angel among us?) borrowed from an outstanding film (Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire) and make a mess of it. If they had stopped half an hour before the end, leaving the outcome in doubt, the film would have been ok, but that last half-hour of soap opera or melodrama, or overwrought junk would kill a better film than this. Lilly Kilvert gets full marks for production design, and the actors deserve credit for trying to put some life into this dreary tale, but in the end we say thumbs down!"
2,I couldn't believe. . .,"There's a scene with all these black coated creeps hanging around a hospital waiting for people to die. Now I don't want wings on my angels. And I don't want a thousand angels on the head of of a pin. But a bunch of creepy guys in black dusters hanging around a hospital waiting for the flesh to give up the spirit is just something too far off.Nicholas Cage is an angel. And he's willing to give up immortality, and I assume his immortal soul, just so he can touch Meg Ryan. Hey most men would give up a lot to touch Meg Ryan. But as the romantic premise for a movie?In the end this is like so many recent movies. All style and no substance. And the images are admittedly enticing. But there's got to be more. If there are angels, they've got to be more than dour dope in black dusters."
2,The Original Is Better,"Back in 1988, on a friend's recommendation, I saw ""Wings of Desire"" in the theater and loved it. Subsequently, I was interested when Hollywood made its own version of Wim Wender's film with Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan, both actors whose work I've enjoyed. I saw ""City of Angels,"" and for the most part I liked it -- that is, until the very end. What a DOWNER!! No matter that the movie gets all psedo-warmfuzzy-philosophical and time-to-get-out-your-handkerchiefs, it misses the point of the original film, which was a celebration of Human Life and Love. I own the DVD of ""Wings of Desire."" One viewing of ""City of Angels"" was enough for me."
1,Not worthy to tie Wim Wenders's shoelaces,"I love, love, love ""Wings of Desire."" I went to see this remake hoping it would at least approach Wim Wenders's ethereal vision and joy.Shot ""Wings of Desire"" in the kneecaps is the feeling I left the theater with. Dark, dismal and downright appalling.Please, please, please see ""Wings of Desire"" before you comment on this movie. You'll be doing yourself and everyone else a favor."
2,"the good news, he is an angel. The bad news, he looks like Nicolas Cage.","This movie is a desperate imitation of ""wings of desire"". It is cheesy and barely contemplates the thought of existence. The only part you might want to watch is when the Goo goo dolls song is played. After all, if you want to sacrifice eternity, you better not do it for Meg Ryan!"
3,Giving up Immortality for Heaven on Earth....,"""All God's angels come to us disguised...."" -James Russell LowellWhen we think of angels, we think of light, power, comfort, healing, goodness, wisdom, loveliness and protection. We think of celestial beings who we think of with wonder.In this movie the angels are much more human, in fact, Nicolas Cage chooses to become human and gives up his immortality in order to be with his true love.This movie is terribly romantic and is a real tear jerker. The ending shows how wonderful it is to be human and to be alive.This movie is SO sad! Women will love it. I watched it with two girlfriends and we were all passing around the box of tissues!""If...we would cast the gift of a lovely thought into the heart of a friend, that would be giving as the angels give."" -George Macdonald~The Rebecca Review"
3,Glossy and Formulaic!,"For those who compare this to the infinitely superior masterpiece 'Wings Of Desire', will be extremely unsatisfied. The fact is that you're better off not thinking of comparing them or you won't enjoy what this film has to offer. Meg Ryan's performance is the key to the success of this film, beautiful performance that elevates the romance. Nicolas Cage is a very talented actor, but I think he was miscast, his character is creepy and very unangelical. While some scenes are identical to 'Wings Of Desire' and the plot is almost the same, it does take the angels 'rules' and bends them and even breaks some. A formula movie in it's essence but it works in it's own sappily romantic way. Great songs. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
1,A horrible movie.,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I thought I would like it because I usually like romantic movies, but this was just depressing and sad. All of the things that happened in the movie seemed so stupid and unreal. I don't see why anyone would think this is a ""romantic"" and ""touching"" movie."
1,"Great premise, terrible movie","I love Meg Ryan, and like Nicholas Cage, and wound up renting this movie in the hope of seeing a romantic, lush movie. The movie starts off slow - and then just gets slower. Cage is moody and somewhat one-dimensional, Ryan is great but not enough to carry the picture.I could have walked away with a good feeling overall if the ""twist"" at the ending hadn't been ridiculous and frustrating. Who wants to see a movie with an unhappy & depressing ending?Save your money - and your time. City of Angels made me wish for a prescription of Prozac."
1,"What, I can't give it 0 Stars !","TERRIBLE ! Was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My girlfriend and I went to see it at the movies and neither one of us said anything the whole movie but after it was over we both said that we wanted to walk out. We both hated it, and she usually cries at these type of movies. She did not shed a tear. It was not a long movie, but it seemed to drag forever. You do not get emotionally involved with the characters at all.Do not buy this, do not even watch it. There are much better things to do with your time. BEWARE!"
1,Sappy and Dull,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie after one of my friends recommended it. She guarunteed that I would cry. You can be sure that I cried all right: first, because I had paid $3.50 to rent this film, and then when I realized how bad it was. I am a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, but I can't stand Meg Ryan. I had hoped one would cancel the other out. Unfortunately, it didn't. This film was ridiculously sappy and long. I actually fast-forwarded through some of the conversations because they were so dull. Plus there was no chemistry between Cage and Ryan. I was completely unconvinced. The saddest part of this film is that the soundtrack is so great. This movie does not deserve the great songs that were placed in it. I wish there was a law against pairing an awesome soundtrack with a lousy movie. Overall: good music, good actors, but they rely too much on cliche lines and cheesy dialogue."
4,This movie completely entranced me.,"This was such a great movie. Cage and Ryan really pull you into the story. It shows so well what some people will got through to find true love. At every point in the movie, Cage looks like he's about to break down and cry but that just makes you empathize with him even more. The only thing that really surprised me was the ending. When Meg Ryan was riding her bike back home I was thinking that this was going to be such a great ending to the movie and it was really going to lift me up. I was devastated when I saw what happened. I was crying histerically and my friend had to console me. However, like Cage said in the end, it's better to have one hour with the person that you truly love then live an eternity without them. This movie is all about true love and the lengths that someone will go to to reach it. Difinitely spend your money to buy it."
3,Wings of Desire sans poetry,"This movie has awed lots of people. Probably, most of them are yet to see Wim Wenders ""Wings of Desire"" and better yet, ""Faraway so Close"", films on which this one was inspired. Basically, City of Angels gets some of the best aspects of the original, and removes all the poetry from it, and makes sure it's more Hollywoodian. The emotional aspects are treated in the usual artificial manner, which greatly detracts from the experience. Do yourself a favor, and watch ""Faraway so Close"", you can't go wrong."
4,"Sensational, takes you by the heart and makes you say ""WOW""","City of Angels was by far one of Cage's (Face Off, Con Air) best movies. He plays a real heart touching role. Cage and Ryan just click. They really set the mood and the scene. You wonder if they really are in love. The ending just made me realize how much a person can mean to another. Not at all what I expected. I'd recomend it to everyone. Four Stars."
3,Disappointing ending kills angels,"Yes,it's a good movie.It's going very well untill,you know,the climax.It's terrible sad when you're trying so hard but find bitterness in the end,isn't it? Watching it makes me believe in love but have doubt in happiness."
3,I was prejudiced at the start of this film...,"Wings of Desire (Wim Wenders), which City of Angels is (loosely) based on, is my all-time favorite movie. Which wouldn't necessarily mean that I would harshly judge City of Angels, but the parts I loved best about Wings of Desire - the very spiritual themes, the poetry, and the unusual camerawork and use of lighting and color, were completely lost in this American version.Add to that the added twist at the end, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.This movie, on its own, is okay for a ""date film"" - except for the ending, which only made me wonder why they did it that way.But when it's another rendition of an incredible film like ""Wings of Desire"", it's just a complete disappointment.I'd say skip this one - and get Wim Wenders' film instead."
5,Fall for this classic tale,"I love this movie, and have seen it many times. Could watch it many more, as well. It shows what some people can and will do for love. And what some SHOULD do, but won't."
3,It's not a remake. It's a retelling.,"""Wings of Desire"" is among of my favorite movies. To say that ""City of Angels"" is a remake of ""Wings of Desire"" is wrong. It is a retelling. ""City of Angels"" in my opinion was not as profound as ""Wings of Desire"". It lacked the impact of how Angels were portrayed and focused more the underlying theme of love. Which brings me to my point that ""City of Angels"" is just a love story. And a fairly decent love story it is by Hollywood standards. If I had never seen ""Wings of Desire"" then I would've probably liked this movie more. But being a fan of ""Wings of Desire"" has somewhat heightened my expectations of movies that portray Angels. In ""Wings of Desire"" the Angel that chose mortality used love as an inspiration to desire all that life has to offer. While in ""City of Angels"" the Angel there chose mortality because he fell in love with a mortal woman. It is not as deep and inspirational as ""Wings of Desire"". They are two very different movies."
4,Very nice movie,"This is a very nice love story, one of the best love movies I have ever seen. I also really liked the way it shows that you cannot believe only in materialism and that there's nothing beyond, as that's a very empty life. It may be happy in its own (blind) way, but it's actually very empty. This is what a young doctor (Meg Ryan) discovers and decides to change. The movie is very sweet throughout, but not sappy. Beware, as it's not a happy movie, though!"
3,An exploration of the divine power of love,"How can any film that opens with the death of a little girl and ends with a tragedy be so uplifting and happy? Well, the real subject of City of Angels is the overwhelming power of love to redeem life itself. The cinematography is especially good. The cast is wonderful and the story unusual. An interesting, worthwhile film."
1,"Please please please, watch Wings Of Desire instead!","humorless, overarching remake of one of the best films ever made. People give it kudos because it didn't tack on a happy ending like most American reduxes, but guess what folks, this movie should have a happy ending! Its supposed to be about joy, not loss. For pathos, watch the sequel, Far Away So Close."
2,Try it as a silent movie!,"The only reason I borrowed this film was because it featured my two favorite TV cops--Frantz and Braugher. The movie looks lovely (except for Cage's mopey eyes) and the soundtrack is great, so do what I did--go to the options, where you can turn on the subtitles, turn off the sound, and just listen to the music. As a silent film, it actually works pretty well.But once is pretty much enough."
1,The. Worst. Remake. Ever.,"Except for the mugging of Solaris.This film is to be avoided at all costs. It loosened my bowels. Do yourself a big fat favour and give it a skip and see the original film, ""Wings of Desire"" by Wim Wenders, which is one of the best films. Ever. ""Wings of Desire"" is worth owning. City of Angeles isn't worth visiting, in oh so many ways...."
2,pretty darn bad,"although meg ryan is always compellingly disgustingly cutie, the movie is bad. what a bad idea. bad story."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This is the americanized version of the lovely ""Wings of Desire"" shot in Germany in 1988 by Wim Wenders. You should see that film. It truly is a beauty. THIS one, however, is so sub-par in comparison it is laughable. And not in a good way. Why, oh why, do american moviemakers insist on remaking old classics and foreign films? No ideas of their own I suppose. Pathetic. A great film recast and redone with a silly, shallow, cloying Hollywood veneer. Totally pointless and completely missing the artistry of the original. If I knew how to give negative stars, this one would get 5 of them."
1,"forget it, it's not worth it.","It was more like watching a documentary! all these sites and the music, very little talking on the part of the actors. The more annoying thing bout this film was having to watch the cold performance by Cage. Add to that: who on earth have even conceived the thought that all angles live in a library building????? This title is definetly not worth the money or the time."
2,ANGEL FOOD CAKE,"It seems there's this angel who comes to Earth and falls in love with a beautiful woman and becomes infatuated with human beings and life and this is not ""Death Takes A Holiday"" and if you like movies about angles who confront human nature as if it's an exotic butterfly then this is likely to be the cherry on your ambrosia pie."
5,It is one of the best films I've seen in a long time.,City of Angels is one of those movies that you can watch over and over. There are times that it makes you cry and times when you are laughing. I havent seen a movie like this in a long time. I would recommend it to eveyone.
2,"Visual, Stylistic, yet, doesn't hit like Wings Of Desire..","Wondering why Wim Wenders wasn't credited for this blatant borrow. An attempt to copy the original, slight shift in character and story. The result, a contrived effort to change a little here and there. The chemistry seemed to be lacking between the principals. The singular strength of the original story, proves that Wim Wenders vision splendid endures, even if it had to be Hollywoodized. Check out the original Wings Of Desire-Wim Wenders, with a riveting cameo by Peter Falk. City is ultimately saved by it's well thought out soundtrack. ...A filmmaker"
2,Real boring movie,I just can't think of angels in black. Maybe Men in Black. Maybe they should have called this movie Angels in Black.
3,What should I say..?,"Umm..I find it's hard to give comment becasue I think the film dosen't go smoothly.It lacks something and I feel a little frustrated after watching it.Still,it's above-average(but not much)"
2,Casting is the best thing in Angels,One of the reasons Angels got more compliment than it should is brilliant acting by Nicky and Meg.It DOES help a lot with movie that has nothing in it but magnetic stars.
1,Something about meg ryan! 26th june 2004.,"No affense or anything, but i don't like meg ryan. Her films are entirely boring, i think she as ruined herself abit by her surgery, and i would feel sorry for any pretty actress who had the same. God bless mine hasn't had anything done."
1,"I'm sorry, but this movie is AWFUL","Honestly, I am a hopeless romantic, and I thought this movie was one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. From the very beginning, I just did not buy into the story and it went downhill from there. The angels all hanging around in black trench coats made me tense...not to mention that as a Christian, I found the whole concept to be totally non-biblical, which may be why I just never got hooked. I stuck it out for the ending, and found that even that made me feel empty and mad. Overall, I think the movie was too obvious an assault on my senses and it just never touched my heart. if you like movies where the dead communicate with the living, try ""Always"" with Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss. Total tearjerker."
2,I WAS VERY VERY DISAPOINTED !!!!!,This movie was very mediocre. An average movie that shows falling into coices and choosing the choice that benefits you will lead to disaster! The only thing good about this production is the awsome soundtrack.
2,THIS IS THE REVIEW YOU WANT TO READ,"Decent soundtrack. Overrated movie. Cage bores me, Ryan plays her typical self, and the idea of giving up eternal life to be with someone for this pathetically short lifetime is stupid. And no, I'm not an anti-romantic...I just don't have screwed up, selfish priorities which is exactly what this movie promoted."
5,The Greatest Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Truly, this is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. Nicolas Cage gives the most stellar performance of his acting career. I loved the entire movie, except for the ending. But despite that tragedy, Seth's love for her will always be eternal, and he will die happy knowing he had just that one night with her. This movie really inspires me. It gives me hope that there really can be true eternal love in this world. If you plan to watch this movie, (and you should, you really should), don't forget your box of tissues. You were wonderful, Nic."
4,Cage and Ryan are excellant....disappointing end to story!!!,I loved the movie. Very touching. Cage and Ryan were nothing but great in it. However i was not expecting the ending it had. I thought it was going to be a different ending. I wish it would have been!! What a tear jerker!!! Even though i didn't care for ending will watch it again and again.
5,Captured my heart and soul!,"After seeing this film once I had to see it again and to date have wathced it 4 times.Each time I have been touched with many deep emotions! Each time I watched this film was like the first time as there were new feelings & emotions brought to MY surface.Like being deeply In Love, each time was like the First time!The entire cast and effects were exceptional!I'd watch it again and again just to remember/experience how TRUE LOVE FEELS, GIVES, LIVES!A Must See!"
3,A BIT TOO ANGELIC FOR ME,"Great stuff and well donw, if you like sweet sentimental pics and first rate tear jerkers.I agree with a former viewer who says that Cage may have been the wrong casting choice. Meg Ryan, though, is near perfect in the role.I could do without Dennis Franz slobbering over food to show how human he has become.. But then, being uncouth has apparently become his forte.I do not believe the film holds up with repeated viewing except perhaps for the great extras on the DVD showing just how the picture was made."
2,Disappiontment!,"As a fan of Cage, I am very disappointed.. The plot is too simple and the performance was not good."
5,Awestruck by an angelic piece of Poetry,"This is one of the most beautiful love stories you can find on film. No better an angel than blue-eyed Cage and no better the love of his life than mesmorizing blonde curly-haired Meg Ryan. Even though this is being put down as a ""chick flick"" :-) I know of a lot of guys who really liked the movie (though they hate to admit to it, of course :-)), so don't let yourself be discouraged by bad reviews. Instead, make the journey yourself - follow angel Seth through his tormented journey to be with a human - to feel, touch, smell... ""I'd rather have one touch of her hand, one smell of her hair, one kiss of her mouth than eternity without it. One."" Poetry in motion. Amazing. Funny. Stunning yet simple. I wish I had an angel like that fall for me :-). Don't forget your hankies and get the soundtrack when you're done watching :-)."
3,Good,"I enjoyed the film, *but* Wings of Desire is a great, poetic masterpiece, and I couldn't help comparing the two films. City of Angels shows the touch of Hollywood, but what can you expect? ... Also, in Wenders' film, the city (Berlin) is a character unto itself. City of Angels lacks this dimension."
1,Junk,"This movie was completely idiotic. The entire idea of the angels not being able to feel was mishandled (see the ""What does a pear taste like?"" scene. How is someone who could never taste supposed to know what ""sugary sand"" tastes like? But Cage's character just nods. Terrible.) The ""plot twist"" was ridiculous. And yes, the angels do look ominous. Meg Ryan was miscast as a heart surgeon. This is simply not worth watching. However, as a result of this crappy movie, I have been introduced to Wim Wender's version, which I will check out as it sounds far superior. The one star is for that."
2,wrong rating,"when I placed an order for this movie it was rated PG-13, when I got the order, it was rated R, I was very dissapointed as we try not to watch rated R movies in our home, yet I love this particular one."
2,An atheist's dream...,"I saw Wings of Desire when it was in theaters years ago. So I'm sitting home tonight with little to do, and I turn on City of Angels on FX -- not knowing anything about it -- and realize after a while that it's got to be a remake of WoD. I guess you have to buy into the idea that life with God just can't quite compete with life here on earth. Unfortunately, I didn't buy the idea in German, and I can't buy it in English either. I will say that this version is not as depressing as the German version, but, hey, that's not saying much. WoD is something I would expect Debbie Downer and Bob Bummer to take in as a date flick."
2,Why did she have to die?,"The main character isn't supposed to die! Okay, this movie would have sucked even more if she didn't but it was a really sad ending. The added features on DVD were why I bought this and they weren't that great. If you are looking for one of Nicolas Cage's great action flicks like The Rock this is the WRONG movie for you. However he is a great actor and was in this movie too. He really sells the role. If I had it to do over again I'm sure I could have found another DVD more worth my money."
2,Puh-leeesssseeee,"OK, let me get this straight. A being in the company of the All Mighty is willing to give that all up to become human. On top of that, the main reason that he is willing to do this is because of Lust (not love - let's get that straight). A sin in which we know is adultery. Then he further sins by now sleeping with this woman to whom he is not married.Yep, God would surely give an Angel the chance to be human so that he could commit another sin. We know what happened to the first Angel that commited a sin...."
1,this was the worst!,"this is meg ryan and nicholas cage in their absolute worst. nicholas's acting was that of a 3rd graders! i would recommend NOT seeing this movie! if i could, i'd give it 0 stars."
5,this movie is so perfect!,"The ending is actually unexpected but it really runs perfectly. For me, that was the right ending. The soundtrack is perfect too! The stars are really great, especially Cage. love it!"
2,Ryan and Cage = NO SPARK,"I am perhaps the biggest Meg Ryan fan around. I absolutely adore When Harry Met Sally among her other great films. This flick ws almost as disappointing as 1998's Youve Got Mail. The difference is that in You've Got Mail Hanks and Ryan have a connection that ignites on screen, while this movie had an okay script just bad casting on the choice of Cage."
5,wow.,"I loved and still love this movie. It is my #1 favorite movie. The only bad thing about it was the flippity ending. But when you put it together as a hole, what you end up with is the movie of this millenium. Sad and tearful and inspriring. All my friends love it. So does my boyfriend!"
3,a new and intersting portrayal of angels,I thought this movie was very inventive with its use of angels. Nicolas Cage starts to get on your nerves toward the end but the two leads do have some chemistry and you feel pulled along by the romance. One of the best soundtracks though and great cinematography. A one-hanky movie.
2,Too melancholy,"I thought this was going to be a wonderfully uplifting love story. Instead I found it to be depressing and dark. My goodness, I never imagined angels to be so gloomy - Seth always looked like someone had run over his puppy. He should have been allowed to smile a bit. Plus the ending seemed contrived. Reminded me a bit of Titanic, but then we all knew how that would end...."
2,Could be better.....,"I enjoyed watching it until the floppy ending.The only scene I cried is in the beginning when young daughter died even her mom tried so hard to pray for her.It's the most heartbreaking moment,not its ridiculous ending."
3,"Bad,terrible ending","This movie is not for everybody.I mean,not everyone find it enjoyable and pleasant.Ending is the main problem here and movie would be better if it'd been changed.It's not about sad or happy ending,but ""reasonable"" and ""intelligent"" one. Movie can have various kinds of ending as long as it dosen't destroy main plot.City of Angels is a bad example of that."
2,"""City of Angels""- Poor Copy of ""Wings of Desire""","""Angels"" is simply a bad movie, whether you compare to Wim Wenders' masterpiece ""Wings of Desire"". ""Angels"" has only boring dialogue interjected with scenes of pretty Meg Ryan looking tentative. If it's trying to emulate ""Wings"", it has failed terribly. :-( Please watch ""Wings"" or Wong Kai-wai's ""Fallen Angels"" instead."
3,Good but discouraged movie,"Don't get me wrong,it's a wonderful movie and I suggest you buy it--if you don't mind sobbing ending."
4,Parallel to the Hindu Dvaita philosophy.,"As I watched the movie, it struck me how close the plot of the movie came to the Hindu Dvaita philosophy where the Angels are referred to as Nithya Soorigal...those who have attained Godliness- can witness God, but can never become one with Him.Inspirational...."
5,One of my favourite movies @}->---,"This is a definate chick flick but it's a good one. I love the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage in here. She plays a Dr and he's an Angel who sees her in the hospital where she works. She can see him but he doesn't let her know his secret. The only way their relationship can grow is if he leaves his 'life' as an angel. He can leave the life of no death, pain and sadness, and trade it for a normal life that humans experience.They both act really well in this and it was good to see Meg in a more serious role. I cannot go into more depth without giving you the ending, but I have to stress that this is such a beautiful movie (ok a little depressing in parts) but overall so good. You will most probably need tissues; it never fails to make me cry. It's such a beautiful romantic story and an under-rated movie for sure. I love it and it's one of my all time favourites.PS I love Megs curls in this."
3,Great Movie except,Loved the movie until the end...that was just wrong! It was a good story to follow but really left me disappointed in the end.
4,This is a great date movie,"While some people would dismiss this as a ""chick flick"", it goes much beyond that. The imagery is wonderful and the premise eerily wonderful. I think the visuals will draw you back to the movie time and time again. In the way that Cliffhanger made you scared of heights, this movie will make you relish them."
3,ancestral grandmother by grandaughter,"I loved this book, Marie Grandin who was one of the women sent by Louis the fourteenth to populate Quebechave been to the church where she and Jean Beaudet were married and the hospital where she died. I don't knowhow anyone in that time and place survived bearing 10 children and all the drudgery involved. Most of herdescendants are as tough as she was. I had the hard cover book but loaned and never got it back have to haveit for my children. Wonderful read."
3,A Disappointment,"I came to this book having finished Musser's ""The Formation of Cinema,"" the first volume in this series. Sad to say, this volume is a disappointment.Yes, there is some good information here, but the author's style is extremely dry, and I found her footnoting style to be very misleading. (She mentioned one film that exists only in fragments in a Soviet film archive in Moscow, and her footnote lists only the original review of the movie in 1914, before there even was a Soviet film archive.) She pursues the topic of the origin of the closeup to death, devoting one whole chapter to whether the camera was 12 feet from the actors or only 9 feet.Admittedly, the era of the ""Patent wars"" is confusing, but I think more could have been done to make this era clearer to readers. This is a very weak volume in an extremely good series of books on the American cinema."
1,No Comparison,"When I started making boxes, a friend of mine gave me a copy of David Freedman's book Box-Making Basics. That book contains photographs of a variety of boxes, has large line drawings to illustrate details, has precise measurements for each box, and has a numbered step-by-step procedure for making each box. That book enabled me to make several of the boxes in the book with relative ease. Stowe's book, on the other hand, really disappointed me. Although it has colored photographs of the boxes, they are so small that it's difficult to see what's going on in them. His procedures for actually building the boxes are way too general for me to follow. In a couple of sentences, he attempts to describe five or six procedures at a time. He has no dimensions for any of the boxes. There are no line drawings to further illustrate what he's trying to show in the tiny photographs. If I had used this book when I first started making boxes, I probably would have built book cases instead."
2,"Big on marketing, short on details","I have over 30 year of woodworking experience building tables, chests etc. I bought this book as it sounded like everything I ever needed to know about box making. The book was a big disappointment. It has lots of colorful pictures on nice glossy thick paper, but lacks the detailed instructions of how to build a box. Normally the Taunton Press (Fine WoodWorking Magazine) has excellent articles, but this book falls short of giving you the 'know how' to build a box."
4,Box Making,The book gave me several new ideas for design as well as new techniques for creating beautiful boxes. It was well illustrated but could have included some specific plans.
4,El Arte del Cajón,"Un exelente libro para la creación de todo tipo de cajas realmente es muy detallado y completo,Javier"
1,USELESS,A total waste of money. An amateurs account of how he makes heavy work of some of the simplest tasks. The designs are appalling. Giving it a One Star rating is too high for it.
5,This is the best.,"I have been box making for several years now and have found Doug Stowes books to be amongst some of the best. It is obvious that he is very talented in this field and some of his examples will simply blow your mind. I do not suggest this as your first book though, get David Freedman's basic box building book first and then buy this afterwards. There are tons of pictures with examples that serve as an excellent reference for ideas on your own projects. I believe Doug Stowe may in fact be the best box builder in the world....his work sure says he is. Buy it!!"
3,Taunton Box Making,"I was initially really excited to get this book. I am setting up a new wood shop and planned to make beautiful boxes as a side hobby. This book has lots of photographs of boxes so I thought it would be great. It does talk about the shop, tools needed and gives guidance on the types of joints used in boxes. It talks about jigs with some photos as well. I was hoping to see more information about use of laminates, intarsia, various woods, etc... I also was hoping to see plans for making boxes. Not much there. Also, not much on wood finishes or hinges. It is a nice book, but tends to be focused on joinery. Maybe that should havbe been the title or subtitle. I will keep looking for another book on this topic."
4,Excellent if you have all the machines; not so useful if you have a small shop.,"I chose this one because it has step-by-step color images and the format is broken down into logical sections for the beginner.The only problem is that most of the procedures require large machines (e.g., table saw, planer/joiner, wood lathe…). I have very limited space, so I have only hand tools and small machines. I could improvise based on the book's descriptions, but that still means most of the images and text are not useful for me. This book would be 5-stars if it had alternate methods for small shops. I hope the publisher makes one for that purpose in the series…If I had a larger shop, or easy access to one, I would keep this book and I will definitely re-buy it if I ever expand my shop. So, highly recommended if you have the machines!"
1,secrets of the masters is a literary disaster,"This is one of the worst written pieces of literature I've had the displeasure of reading. It has numerous sentence structural problems and grammatical errors, along with thoughts and ideas bouncing back and forth. After you cross out the sentences and paragraphs repeated over and over, correct punctuation and spelling errors, combine the simple structures into cumulative sentences,the pages of actual useable text is cut in half. Although there is some useful information, this book was not proofread and edited before its print and sale. It's worth 16.95 at best, as is."
3,Super tiny,The earrings are cute and as depicted but tiny. They just hoop around the lobe. Pay careful attention to the size indicated. They are well made and pretty - just not what I expected (since I apparently did not pay attention). Still worth it.
3,sterling earrings,These are very beautiful earrings. They are a little smaller than I had anticipated. The curved and rather short post make them a little difficult to put on.
3,Tiny,"Make sure you read the measurements before buying jewelry. Afriend of mine says"" buying a cat in a bag' and that it true, unless you read the measurements.Mine are tiny like everyone reviewing these earring has written.I saw them as something that looked bold, but they aren'tI read they're 13 mm and that is small. I should've read this information before buying.They were just too small for me and for the price but I have a very happy niece!"
1,Purchase these only for children or teens,"These earrings are as pictured but they are not meant for adults. See the other one star review from another customer, that person is correct! If your earlobes are thicker than 1/4 of an inch, the earrings will pinch and you will ""feel them"" when you are wearing them. My pair has hinges to open more but one hinge is stuck and does not open as much as the other. I will either return them or give them to a preteen."
1,Very disappointed,"My wife loved the earrings. Unfortunately, the quality of the lock is very poor and one earring was lost on the first day!"
2,Save your money,"This book contains a lot of good information on RPG/400 programming. However, it is not very clearly written, and is somewhat difficult to follow. Also, the authors make, IMO, to many assumptions about what you already know, for a book which is supposed to be a ""basic"" level introduction. I think there are much better RPG/400 books out there."
4,"Simple to read, straightforward and effective golf handbook ever","With this book, it will give you a very simple read and easy to understand to improve your golf lesson. Even though it is a small size, short sentence with old print image, this book is a hassle-free reading (compare to hardcover textbook like), where you can easily find the subject you want during your practice. A good 1st book for golf beginner to start with."
4,Touched Emotions,"The year 2000 was heralded in with this song ""Can't Stop"" Album: Sleepless jacksoul""Can't Stop"" dealt with all the emotions that we experienced at year ending 1999.jacksoul lets us open our own thoughts to unwind all these pent up emotions, broken relationships and all the good reasons ""Can't Stop"" speaks to me. We all have questioned our mental health but we cannot let anyone know about this, we just can't stop being in love, with the occasion or the person or the job, our life. 2000 - 2001 Goal settings for a positive new millinum ""mindsets"".Can't Stop is now nominated for the Juno Awards in Canada at the Copps Colisium, Hamilton, Ontario Looking forward to root for ""jacksoul"" throughout this grand Celebration. March 2001.""CAN'T STOP"" jacksoul Album ""SLEEPLESS"" A MUST!!!"
3,Jus 1 Hott Song,"My first Dance Mix NYC CD. Too much vocals on this album for me. Track 14 is unbelievable though. This is the only track I listen to. HOTT. I like all the NYC Underground Party albums, especially vol.2 & vol.3. The blends in Dance Mix NYC 5 are nice and clean for my tastes. BTW, the Greek Song (Gia) was not good in this album, there was very little bass and mostly annoying music that ""colored"" the songs Greek theme, i was expecting repititions of that famous Gia rythm, but it was hard to make it out, i'm sure Louie Devito would do or has done a better job withthis song."
3,Nice collection of hits in short version form,"This new collection of Gloria Gaynor's greatest hits includes her major hits and some extras as well! The disc has been remastered and sounds great, but unfortunately the songs are around 3 minutes and under. For those who could care less about extended versions this collection is all you need. For those who want the ultimate collection buy The Gloria Gaynor Anthology 2 - cd set. This includes full length extended versions of all her hits!"
2,Better if it was condensed,"This book is very dry, but a necessary evil for a course I am taking. If they condensed the content down to the key elements and the charts, you could get by with about 1/2 the total page length."
4,A wonderful look into the life and loves in the lesbian comm,This is a great look at the life and loves of the lesbian community. I truly enjoyed it!
1,Pirate sold as original,"What to think of a product that is supposed to come to your hands as a double CD set and has only 1 place into the box. YES, THIS IS TRUE, instead of having that special plastic double CD case it came into an ordinary single CD box. The 2 CDs were sharing the same single CD space...WHAT A BLOODY JOKE !!!!!! DONT BUY IT !!!!!"
3,"Fun, but hardly believeable.","I just watched Hot Rod after not having seen it for several years. Like others have said, the people take back stage to the cars in this obviously budget-made movie. The plot is simple and totally unrealistic, but fun, just like the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. The acting's okay but there are no reasons given for people's behavior and with all the BS that goes on, nobody even gets upset, least of all, Brian, the main character, played by Gregg Henry. Anyone know whatever happened to him? Anyway, while the movie is fun and the drag racing is exciting, the makers of this ""film"" didn't do their homework, calling a '65 Fury a Dodge, taking a Hemi out of an AMC Matador(?!), and generally the editing is competent at best. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but movies like ""Heart Like A Wheel"" and others are much better movies and are much more true to life. Like all reviews, this is just my opinion so take it as you will."
4,Great Purchase for the Price!,"I bought this back-pack after taking a hike to our famous Blue Mountain Peak in the pouring rain (12 hours) last January. My dry T-shirt and socks were thoroughly soaked, so I had nothing to change into. I decided to try this one after reading the comments. I did the hike this past weekend and I am extremely happy that I made this purchase. Everything was nice and dry despite the trek again in rain... Good thing I decided to keep my friend's T-shirt in it as his backpack was soaked through...The only improvement would be a pocket to hold a water-bottle on the side or something."
1,Streaky,"Nope, don't like em. Left a totally streaky mess on the windows. I used them as directed, I think. Are ya supposed to wipe and and wipe until the cloth goes dry or something. If so, I don't see how. Ok to wipe off other things, but not glass."
3,Hard to get out of the container,The wipes were so-so and it was a bit of a hassle to get them out of the big container. I wouldn't buy them again.
1,THIS IS NOT A VIDEO GAME,"This is a book on CD, NOT A VIDEO GAME.Trust me, I bought it, and had to use an Amazon a-to-z guarantee to return it. IT'S A BOOK ON CD for children."
5,I feel like I'm back home.,"I went to go see them last year at the Flynn center. Their music is so lively, that I can't help but tap, clap, sing or dance to it. When I listen to the music , I feel like I'm back home in Quebec."
4,The 1970's...,"I bought this album sometime in the late 70's. I had heard something from this band late one night on the radio.. back when radio was a place where you could hear new and different types of music without the station being concerned if liked every tune they played.. anyway, I got around to buying one of their albums although not the one I heard that night. The album has some decent stuff.. but it's masterpiece is an absolutely stunning rendition of Joni Mitchels ""Stange New Flesh"". The band is very tight and the lead vocals have a soulful and gritty feel. The price is worth just having that one tune."
3,Go west young man go west!,"If this book takes you back to the source material, then it will have accomplished its goal. The book itself, lacks the finesse of it's intellectual founders. But by god do we need this book in order to point us back. The last three years have been a result of reading all the source material for the book and for that Jamshid - I thank you.The best of luck."
1,Striking Down the Tall Poppies,"The story: A rabbit is magically gifted with red wings and a joyful ability no other rabbit has: flight. But he soon learns that To Be Different is Bad. The other rabbits, instead of sharing his joy, reject him for his special gift, as does his own mother. He soon learns that it's better to deny your own gifts than to Be Different; and in the end, voluntarily shorn of the wings that gave him so much delight and lifted him above other rabbits, he is again accepted by rabbitkind.A stirring celebration of mediocrity, and a much-needed message to children with gifts and talents that they had better learn to hide them. If you enjoyed this book, you'll love Rainbow Fish."
2,Scared me to death!,This story used to scare me to death when I was little. The rabbit got rejected by all his friends and his mom and had to spend the night by himself. I definitely would not read this to my baby.
3,Ok for the money,"Very nice little unit with acceptable but not great tonal quality. Works well amplifying my wife's flute (had to rig up a holder for the tieclip microphone), but speaker coloration isn't natural sounding when amplifying a saxophone. Reverb is kind of poor (delay would have been much nicer, whether digital or analog, but for the money what do I expect...) Surprisingly loud.I'd like to find something comparably portable and convenient, but with higher quality sound, better effects."
3,Group Activity,"This was required for my class, and it's a fun activity, but it's just a 12-page booklet, so not really worth $12."
5,Excellent resource for putting magic to work in your life.,"I found this book easy to read, understand, and use for practice. It is well written and gives easy guidence especially for those just beginning to explore magic. It is not limiting to one group or practice. This is a good feature for those who define their god or goddess slightly different from any other they have read or heard or seen. The author encourages the user to develop their own skills beyond mimicing those of others. She starts simply and leaves lots of room for expansion into complex spells and rituals. This book will especially touch those who are more logical and practical and doubt the powers of the universe. I have had a whole new world of happiness, power, and possibilities open up to me after completing this text. Harming none do thy will. Good Luck."
5,Great book,I love this book! It proves that you don't have to follow a specific religion to practice magic. And it is very down to earth and practical as the title implies. I recommend this book to ALL of my students.
5,A refreshing outlook on magic for solitary magicians.,This book looks at the art of magick in a different light than most of the other well know authors I have read. Nancy Watson focuses upon the importance of understanding the principles of magick. It is a great addtion to any magicians bookshelf.
5,a great primer,I think this is the ultimate starter guide for the new witch. I highly recommend it. She covers a wide variety of techniques.
3,a slight hinderance,"despite all the good reviews...i would only rate this book as so so in terms of helpfulness. the terminology and some of the ideas were good but a lot of it i found to be quite a hinderance.she seems to cater to the average magician i suppose. i have been practising magick less than a year yet most of my techniques taught to me by my teacher were those she considers only for the most advanced magicians.for example: i have hardly used much physical plane magick even though that is where she implies would be the place for beginners. when i first started out, i instinctly chose the path she refered to as the spiritual plane and the mental plane and all this has served me quite well.on a whole, this book might be a good foundation for beginners but more advanced students might find it to be restrictive."
1,Bad magic,"Having been given this book as a gift, I was quite excited to get down to reading it. In the early chapters I found it very easy to understand what the author was saying but then it got to the subject of Archetypes. The author starts to talk about archetypes as if they are real people and then she really goes over the top when she starts to attack Hitlers character to bolster her rather perverted view. It is now 60 years since the second world war, which incidently was started by the British and not Germany, so why rake it up now? It is a very weak and insecure writer who feels she has to stoop to this type of character assassination. Maybe she should look closer to home at some of the recent American Presidents as moral examples for her book. Whilst the book as some merits, I would not recomend it to anyone who is serious about the subject."
5,A solid basis for any spiritual path,"This is a wonderful book that covers what most other handbooks don't - Why magic does, and sometimes doesn't work. Instead of handing out a bunch of pre-packaged spells, this goes into the mechanics of what goes into a good ritual, and most importantly, how to practice safely. It was my first book, and I would highly recommend it for anyone new to spiritualism, as it does not pick any one path over another. Rather it gives good guidelines for finding the path that's right for the reader. A definate jewel amidst the morass of fluff-bunny garbage on the occult bookshelves!"
3,It met the expectations,"This product simply met my expectations. However, the price it is too high for the product. If I had bought a Cassio watch I would be happier.Not a big deal."
3,VibraLITE3,"This is the second VibraLITE3 that I have owned. The first one lasted for many years and was extremely reliable. The second one was flaky from the start: the function button often skipped over functions, and sweat on my wrist would send the watch into spasms of function switching followed by failure to operate at all, though it eventually recovered. Now after six months, none of the function buttons work at all. Looks like performance for Vibralite3 is the luck of the draw, or else quality control has gone way downhill in the most recent years."
3,Not for a morning alarm,"This watch works perfectly, but I was looking for something to wake me up in the morning. The vibrations were not quite strong enough for that."
2,The vibration is strong enough.,"After wearing it for one week 3 of the front screws came out, so now I'm not sure how long the top part of the watch is going to hold in place with just one screw!"
3,Easier to hear than feel?,"My hearing isn't the best, but I've been able to notice my watch buzzing better by ear than by feel. This watch needs to be improved to shake more and make less of an audible buzz.Another ""feature"" not mentioned in product descriptions is that the repeating alarm (the main reason I bought this -- ""alert me every n minutes"") will not only buzz when the time is up, but will also buzz when 10 and 5 minutes are remaining. That would be great as an option if you could turn it on and off, but you can't.Lastly, I'm forever bumping the 'mode' button on the watch, which not only shifts the display from the time/date to the alarm screen or the timer screen, but also makes the watch buzz whenever you hit it.Since it buzzes so often when I don't want it to, and the vibration isn't as strong as the audible buzzing, it quickly becomes a minor and easily ignored annoyance, which renders the watch rather useless to me. I'll stick with the 'invisible clock' item instead."
3,Vibralite 3 Vibration Watch,"This product meets most of my expectations. One problem, however, is that it is too easy to turn off both alarms (vibrate and ring tone) accidentally (since the same button has other functions)."
5,Wonderful source reference!,"The front chapter gives a history of pattern companies, how the small ones started and eventually merged into Simplicity, McCalls and Butterick. Also includes history on styles that were popular in the early '40s and how WWII affected these styles and the home sewing industry. The majority of the book is pattern covers. This is a valuable source for anyone who has vintage patterns and would like to date them. Or for someone who is trying to sew vintage from new patterns. If you're using new basic patterns, it's possible to recreate sleeves, hemlines, pockets, and other details to make the garment look vintage. Great inspiration!! Highly recommended for anyone interested in the 1940s!!"
2,This could have been a very interesting true crime story...,"if it wasn't for the author's atrocious writing skills.I honestly can't believe this book got published. I was so frustrated and lost that I couldn't even finish but 1/3 of the book.Ms. Wellman, I'm very sorry to be so critical, but you're in the wrong line of work."
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers who were turned off by the author's writing style and bias in favor of Valessa. As I continued reading this book, I was increasingly surprised that it ever got published, so pervasive was the poor grammar and sentence structure. It was disjointed and confusing and lacked substance; I learned so much more from reading a piece that was written on this case for the St. Petersburg Times. I think Kathryn Casey or Ann Rule could have done so much more with this tragic story. Furthermore, the author's bias towards Valessa was very clear, thereby victimizing Vicki Robinson all over again. Please, Ms. Wellman, most children who grow up in far worse circumstances do not take part in murdering their parents. There were NO excuses for Valessa's actions."
4,Great DVD player with strong sound output,"Looked at the Sony DVP NS75H as a competing model with the Panasonic player. Both had great picture quality for a non HD player. The panasonic edged out the sony in sound output. (using HDMI connectors). One great feature is the digital voice enhancer so you can hear people speak on the dvd and not have to turn it up too loud.The included instruction manual could have been written better, confusing. Sony's was a bit more user friendly. The menus for the panasonic are OK, more thought should have been put into this to make it more intuitive. Similar with the Sony player, maybe a bit easier.I ended up with this unit over the sony bc of sound features. Also, no blue annoying light as on the sony player."
4,Pretty good player....,I was in the market for a dvd upconverter...to make my dvds on my hd lcd tv look sharp...well I came across this and so far it's doing the job. I do suggest when you purchase this you go over the settings for the player and tv so that you can get optimal performance. For the more recent dvd releases they're mastered in hd ie: Sony pictures and the picture is sharp and clear on 720p really you'll love it! I suggest watching Casino Royale on 720p and enjoy!
1,Very low quality,"I got this product after a long research. Put the first CD (The lord of the Rings) and image quality was disappointed. Up-conversion was the worst.Returned this product quickly and got and Oppo 981HD. What a difference!!If you are looking for a good DVD player don't buy this, instead buy an Oppo 981HD."
1,Don't buy this DVD Player,I used this DVD player once and the power supply broke. It has been in the shop for almost a month cause the part needed to rebuild it is on backorder with no estimated arrival date. Panasonic won't send me a new one. I am surprised Panasonic manufactures such a poor quality product.
4,Underrated comedy farce...,"Bill Murray is the main character - aptly named Wally, whose 'innocence abroad' plot is fuelled by bumbling spies, dopey bobbies and the farce of political espionage.What makes this a great movie too watch is the old-fashioned 1960's style comedy of errors - such as Pink Panther or Casino Royale (as other reviewers have said). I may be wrong but I think this was the last film were Murray played it in all-out comedy (such as his previous gems such as'Ghostbusters', 'Scrooge' and 'Groundhog Day')If you like Bill Murray then this is a must, but for everyone else there is enough comedy and plot (abeit a crazy plot) to have a good night in..."
5,The Man Who Knew Too Little,I think this is one of the funniest movies I've seen for a while. Bill Murray is just great. Some of the scenes in this movie are just hilarious. I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt. I would recommend this movie to anybody who had a bad day and wants to forget about it for awhile. Great movie with plenty of laughs. GOTTA WATCH IT!P.S. My husband & I have watched it 3 times already and I could watch 3 more times. It just stays funny no matter how many times you see it.
5,"If you have five potential movie tabs open, pick this","Very clever plot, engaging characters, and an all around good time. The perfect movie for a Saturday night. If you're looking for comedy that's entertaining but not too intellectually challenging, pick this."
2,Murray's films have been reliably good..until now,"I've often wondered why Bill Murray's career hasn't afforded him the types of roles we see Robin Williams getting. This film is the explanation. There is some built in comedy here. Murray, thinking he's participating in a theatrical farce, digs himself deep into the underground world of international spies. Through clumsy coincidences he manages to convince those in power that he is actually very clever. This is something to watch if you're reeeeeal desperate. It works on a lowest common denominator type of comedy. Murray incorporates a slapstick humor here, which is not his fortee. I think that the fact that there is no emotional bond to the characters works against its entertainment value. Rent ""Groundhog Day"" or ""Scrooged"" again instead."
2,The comedy that tried hard,"About 8 or 9 years ago the team of Bill Murray and writer-director Howard Franklin delivered the funny and energetic QUICK CHANGE. With THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE, Murray and Franklin tried again with mixed results. They seemed to want to make a quality comedy and Bill Murray definitely will crack you up from time to time. While THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE falls short of the energy level it's trying to reach, it's worth a look nonetheless. See THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE, on cable TV."
1,It was so horribly dreadful!!!!!,Okay despite what the other reviews say this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen in my life! the plot was so stupid and when you were supposed to be laughing I was just grimacing!
1,Why do so many people find this movie funny?,"I saw this movie when it was in the theater with two friends, after 45 minutes(it felt more like 45 hours)and even though we paid 8 bucks each to see it, we all got up and walked out, that's how bad this movie was. In the theater I didn't hear anyone laughing, not even so much as a giggle. My friends never let me live it down that I made them go see it. I agree with the reviewer who said people who like this movie probably think the phone book is hilarious.P.S. I gave this movie one star because I didn't have the option of no stars."
4,horrible reviews for a hilarious film,"Wallace Richie (Bill Murray) works at Blockbuster in Des Moines, and to celebrate his birthday he visits his bigshot brother and banker in London. But brother James must host important German clients to seal a deal, so he enrolls Wallace in a reality television show called ""The Theater of Life"" where contestants play scripted roles. Wallace mistakenly answers a phone call from a real hit man, remains oblivious throughout the film of the mistaken identity, and the rest of the film is about reality mistaken as fiction and vice versa. This film got horrible reviews, but I thought it was hilarious."
4,Surprised Me,I didn't see the movie until it hit cable. Loved it so much I decided to buy it. Simple humor but makes me laugh.
4,Let's have more laughter!,"In an age where there is so much rotten stuff going on in the world it is refreshing to see a good comedy that makes you laugh, no matter what the story line may be or if it makes sense. Bill Murray plays this part like it is an award winner, making the most out of a situation that is, at best, impossible. That is what makes it entertainment - slashings and murders and people with horrid lives is not entertainment in my book. I can get that from the newspapers or evening news every day. Hurrah for Bill Murray and his talent for making me laugh. The movie is a Repeat Watch at my house."
4,Underappreciated Funny Film,This movie was lost in the Austin Powers excitement. It is nothing like Austin Powers but definitely has its moments of hilarity. My only issue with the film is the last two minutes - which I thought didn't work very well. Other than that it is definitely one to watch.
2,Bill Murray Made 4 Good Movies and This Ain't One of Them,"Embarrassingly unfunny and even boring, like most Bill Murray movies. He's had featured roles in a couple of good movies, but as far as Bill Murray movies? Four, count 'em, four. the last one 19 years ago. Just like Eddie Murphy, he has the talent so why so many duds? Number One, poor script selection, which would lead to Number Two, a less than enthusiastic attitude towards his roles in those films."
3,"Funny, but not that Funny!","This was an okay comedy that I caught for the first time on HBO the other day. It had it's funny moments, but they could have done so much more with interesting plot and situations that they had to use. I liked the idea of the movie and I'm a pretty big Bill Murray fan, so I was a little let down by the overall outcome. Check it out for free on T.V."
4,Good entertainment,Good entertainment. It was pretty funny. Good entertainment. It was pretty funny. Good entertainment. It was pretty funny. See bit.
4,Funny!,Classic Bill Murray! Bill is endearing in this wacky comedy about espionage. It is pure entertainment and full of twists and turns.
4,Written Just for Murray,"Much like Ground Hog day, this script was written just for Bill Murray. No one else could make this ridiculous plot work. And like Ground Hog Day, this has become one of my favorite Murray outings. Forget what the elitist critics say. They don't get comedy and they don't get Murray. He plays a dimwitted simpleton thrust into what he perceives is a live action mystery theater constructed just for his amusement, but what is actually a real life cloak and dagger adventure. This sets up perfect Bull Murray scenarios that he milks for all the laughs possible. He plays it to the hilt and the results are hilarious. If you like Bill Murray's humor, you will love this movie. Don't look for deep meaning. Don't expect answers to the meaning of our existence (unless it's just to laugh). This movie delivers the hoots at a fast pace. Nuke the popcorn, pour a Dr. Pepper, open up the red vines and enjoy."
5,"Well-written, entertaining secret agent parody!","When they're done well, movies about somebody in the wrong place at the wrong time can be hilarious! This is certainly the case here, as Murray plays a bumbling American mistaken for some kind of super-agent by the secret services of the superpowers. The supporting cast is excellent, and the film moves at a fast pace. A really fun movie!"
4,"""...any regrets?"" ""Garfield, maybe""","The odds of this movie occurring in real life are about the same as getting 1000 monkey's to type on 1000 typewriters for 1000 years. However, I imagine that that would be just as funny to watch.I imagine the pitch for this film went something like this...""Bill Murray is back, in the new blockbuster side-splitter 'What About Bob: 2'! This time, Bob is mistaken for a government spy who... What's that? Change the name? Ok, how about 'The Man Who Knew Too... umm... Little! Hmm? What's that? No! This genre has plenty of gas left in the tank. You're practically guaranteed to make bank on this.""That pretty much sums up this film. If you find it as easy to laugh at Bill Murray as some people find it to laugh at Will Ferrel, then you might want to plan a few intermissions to stop yourself from getting a hernia. If not, then pop some extra pop corn so you'll have leftovers to throw at the screen."
3,The Man who knew too little,This one is a little older but it was a lot of fun to watch. I laughed out loud several times. Worth watching.
3,Okay for a Saturday night with no plans.,"It was a good movie and moved along nicely. We did not care for the ending, it got pretty silly."
4,Fun Fun Fun,a long time favorite... worth a view anytime. Everyone in the film does a fine job and it is just a good time.
4,a fun movie and decent story,"Bill Murray is always entertaining! The story kept my attention. The supporting actors sometimes had a hard time not cracking up while doing a scene with Bill, especially the female lead. Very funny!"
5,Very funny,Bill Murray is a comedy genius! Review guide lines want 14 more words; I like my reviews short and sweet.
5,Bill Murray at his best,"This show is hilarious. It is a perfect family show because there is little or no vulgarity. Bill Murray is hysterical as an unsuspecting mid westerner who has stumbled onto a major assassination plot in London. He has no idea what is really going on and yet plays the part beautifully to the end. We laughed so hard during one part we had tears in our eyes. He is one of the great comedic men and according to my friend who has actually met him, he's this funny in real life too."
5,Classic,I have been looking for this dvd for quite a while because it is Bill when he is best and the review didnt disappoint any bit.
5,Best Bill Murray Movie!,"This is definitely my favorite comedy. Very quotable lines and memorable scenes. Absolutely Hilarious...just watch it, you won't be disappointed!"
3,Entertaining drivel,"Bill Murrey visits his brother in England and thinks he is spending an evening in an actor's drama, a dinner theater type production where everyone is an actor. Unbeknownst to him, he is really dealing with shady characters with real guns, real bombs and real money. He bumbles and jokes his way through one deadly situation after another.His comedic abilities save this from being a tedious bore. Also, being set in London with English actors makes this more entertaining. It's a way to kill a couple of hours with amusing nonsense."
4,Good old comedy Bill Murray,I love this movie. It's just fun and funny. Great concept. It's a bit over the top and un-realistic... but it's a comedy so I don't mind.
5,Hilarious!,I truly found this movie to be funny. An undiscovered gem if you enjoy comedies. Bill Murray plays the part to perfection and the plot is just right for a comedy. Enjoy! I did.
3,"True to form, but missing a vital part.","Taped in Vancouver's Queen Elizabeth Theatre in the final concert of the reunion tour of '83, Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, and Richard Manuel come back together in The Band Reunion, AKA The Band Is Back.Two versions of this tape exist: The American version, 60 minutes long with only music; and the Canadian version, 87 minutes long with more songs and interviews.The music is true-to-form Band, but the members have noticably aged; you almost feel pity for Danko as he tries, and almost succeeds, to sound the way he used to.Still forging on, the Band provides the best they can, and even though it's not their best effort, it not their worst, either."
4,all aboard for murder,"This is my 3rd entry into the jessica fletcher books and I enjoyed it tremendously. I have always wanted to take a train trip and this book showed me how much fun it can be, of course if no one is murdered on it. This book had lots of info about trains, which I could have done without, but I liked the way jessica was put into danger, and of course she rallyed. Even though the regular Cabot Cove gang was not with her, it still was an enjoyable read. I couldn't figure out the killer and I enjoyed that. It is nice to be surprised. I think it is one of the better books of the collection."
4,Good reading.,"As always, Jessica solves the crime. It was a good story line and hard to figure out who the culprit was!"
4,mellow gold,"Had this CD from a recommendation link via Amazon thru some other title I can't remember - And must of had it a good year without taking it to serious. Then my 4th child was born, and I started playing the CD in the CD player (this at the time) to rock him to sleep. Well this baby must have listened to cd 150+ times because it played so well and soothed so well. There are some truly amazing beautiful acoustic tracks, our favorite being Naked As We Came (inspiring lyrics) and Sunset soon Forgotten. Check it out"
4,Rest easy with Iron and Wine,"I heard an EP from I&W; at my university record store and was simply amazed by this level of guitar playing and beautiful lyrics. The music is incredibly soothing and good for taking a quick nap. The only real qualm I have with this album is that some of the songs sound the same. This is not bad, however, since the first one is great on its own.Also, Jess ""E,"" people such as yourself are what make the midwest so easy to despise."
3,I'm ruined,"I'm ruined. Giving this excellent piece of art a 3 out of 5 stars? It's practically obscene right? But here's the thing. For a guy who writes a song as brain-smashingly beautiful as ""Upwards over the Mountain,"" I think the follow-up almost has to be a tiny bit of a let down. And that's all of a let down his second album is. . .tiny.Still good though, obviously. ""Each Coming Night's my favorite. He's this century's Dylan. And I aint kiddin'."
4,Our Endless Numbered Days,"This sounds beautiful. I am a music snob who longs for something to come out that makes my ears happy. Few if any can do that and very little have lately. I am forced to look back to older albums because nothing new seems to be worth the time. ""Our Endless..."" is. It can be lumped in with other artist of his genre, but to me, it's just ear happy music."
3,"solid, but over-rated","I see the Wine and Iron fan club members did most of the reviews here -- telling us little about the disc except that they are ga-ga for Sam (end of rant). That said, this is a solid effort, even if pretentious and drearily monotonous at times... If you want better intimate singer-songwriter stuff, I suggest early Bruce Cockburn (and not because he is from Ontario - Ottawa/Toronto).Cheers."
3,"Great guitar, but all that inhalation!","I'm surprised to see all of the comparisons to Elliott Smith, because this CD did not remind me of Elliott Smith at all (Smith's work is much better). Dan Fogelberg might be a better choice for comparison. Still, the acoustic guitar work is lovely, and I don't mind his singing voice all that much. What drove me absolutely bananas, and detracted greatly from my enjoyment of the music, were the very audible inhalations on over half of the tracks. He must have had one heck of a head cold while recording this, or had the microphone inside of his mouth, because the inhaling is loud, and it is extremely annoying. Too bad, because I really liked the music, and would disagree greatly with those who found this dull or boring. But Elliott Smith? Not even close."
3,I'd have preferred a bit more energy and amplification,"Hmmm, ""Our Endless Numbered Days,"" which I would have to rank as good but not great, seems to polarize folks quite a bit. Mr. Beam seems to draw heavily from influences such as Cat Stevens and Nick Drake but does not quite reach either's level of subtle use of image or tone or achieve either's transcendence.Tracks such as On Your Wings, Cinder and Smoke, and Free Until They Cut Me Down draw much of their strength from the collective playing of the supporting cast. Naked As We Came and Each Coming Night work well as meditations on the ephemeral quality of life, but some of the other tracks drag or even limp along.For my money, I'd have preferred a bit more energy and amplification."
5,Sam Beam is truly gifted. This is wonderful stuff.,"I just picked this up an hour ago and I've fallen in love with it immediately. All the soothing melodies and beautiful slide guitar work of his first album are there, with just enough variances to keep it fresh and new. Sam Beam is a blessed musician, and kudos to Sub Pop for giving him a record contract."
5,Amazingly beautiful!,"Compared to Iron And Wine's ""The Creek Drank The Cradle,"" this one sounds more melancholy.Melancholy in a romantic way, not in a depressing way.This album also sounds subtly happy, compared to ""Woman King"" which is a tad bit angry.The acoustic guitar that can be heard throughout the whole album is charming!I also love Sameul Beam's hushed soft voice (you wouldn't expect someone who has this soft voice to sport such a beard haha!).His story-telling songs are ones that you'll never get bored of.I've been listening to this album countless times; consider it a classic.I can't say any of the tracks are bad, because they're all brilliant.I thought #5 ""Teeth in the Grass"" has this repetitive guitar tune.#7 ""Radio War"" is a short, redundant song.Other than that, the rest of the album is great.All the songs are worth listening to!"
4,Coming out of my coma to write this review,"Don't let the title fool you, it was a good coma!Iron & Wine's Our Endless Numbered Days is a fantastically simple and relaxing album. I think too many people associate complicated rhythms produced by 50 different instruments combined and unintelligible lyrics with brilliance. I think the first line of the Amazon review says it all: Sam Beam is a brilliant song writer, and it shows. Many of the negative reviews revolve around his simplicity; a man, a whisper, and a guitar. But that's what makes Our Endless Numbered Days so attractive. Even the inside cover is simple as Beam shuns the normal trap, ""thank everybody from kindergarden through today"" every other artist falls into. Beam has written simple, melancholy music that makes some cry (not this guy), others bored (again, not this guy), and some just relaxed. I really enjoy music with a soothing, calming feeling, and this album has it from On Your Wings to Passing Afternoon. Highly recommended."
5,summer warmth,"""Our Endless Numbered Days"" is one of those albums that passses you by, and its over before you know it. It calms your nerves, and makes you feel everything is going to be alirght.Sam's voice gets better and better on each album. I've listened to this album over 100 times now, and I can honestly say, it holds up, and continues to get better and better."
2,Fake Drake,"Take a man with an obvious devotion to Nick Drake (did you know that the title is a clever reworking of some of the lyrics from the last song on Nick's final album Pink Moon?). Make sure he has a passable voice and songwriting skills, and that he can write lyrics that on the surface sound profound. And you'll get this - an uninspired collection that sounds great as backgound music 1 or 2 times, but becomes increasingly pale after a couple listens. Upon scrutiny the lyrics are often senseless and artless. The whole thing has a misleading sense of ""genuineness"" which, when revealed for what it is, really rubs me the wrong way. It's the kind of cd that sounds amazing at Starbucks, but when you bring it home and listen to it a few times you realise you just wasted 15 bucks. With so many real, genuine singer songwriters (Bob Dylan, Bruce Cockburn, Nick Drake himself - to name a few of my favorites) out there there is no reason to bother with this."
2,I must be missing something?,"I've tried to listen to several InW releases,and no matter how much i try,I can't seem to listen to a whole album.Yes,there are some great lyrics in here,but its basically just a man whispering into a mic with background music playing.None of the songs i've heard seem to go anywhere.I do like heatmiser,Elliot Smith, and Bright Eyes,and other slower tempo bands,but i do not see the appeal in this.Good lyrics,boring songs,very little cohesion.This is simply my opinion,but i would not reccomend this at all."
3,"Interesting, but oh, that voice...","I'm usually a big fan of the ""singer-songwriter"", but I found this disappointing. I don't think Beam lives up to the singer end of the bargain. The songs are obviously well-written and the musical accompaniment is beautiful, but his singing voice is just above a buzzy whisper and sounds the same on nearly every track. Definitely worth a listen if you can get past the mosquito drone."
1,Not my cup of tea,"If you like someone straining a whisper into a microphone as two acoustic guitars strum monotonous tones, you might like this. However, it gives me a headache. There isn't anything original here, and frankly it is very dull.And for those who love it, well, don't deny the truth. It is exactly that. A dude whispering into a microphone with two acoustic guitars playing dreary songs. Like I said, if you like that, more power to you. Me, I prefer innovation and a little more of something I can move to or at least use my imagination without wishing to put a bullet in my temple.I'll try listening a couple more times....but right now I have to see a psychiatrist."
2,downgrade to 2 stars and falling,"weak songwriting, and lots of filler make this guy lots of money. you'll find yourself skipping over almost all the tracks here save 3 or 4 average at best tunes. Dont waste your time."
3,"Pleasant, not earth-shaking folk","67% of reviewers give this cd five stars. Many are overcome with their love for the music. To the few who grant this cd but one or two stars it is repetitive, monotonous, boring and therefore unremarkable. For me Samuel Beam makes simple, pleasant, listenable, quiet acoustic folk music. The references to Nick Drake are most apt. This is music that hasn't changed my life. However, it does have its time and place."
4,A Whisper Speaks Volumes,"The man with the awesome beard, Sam Beam, and his co-horts have created a wonderful world of music here. This is ""down-home real"" music, played with care and understatement. All the songs here are good and will reward those who want to hear roots-inspired folk by a master storyteller. Also, check out the ""Woman Kind"" EP."
3,Not nearly as good as 'The Creek...',"'The Creek Drank the Cradle' was a great album. This is not. The lyrics are almost as good but the music is staid and static. Even Beam's second album, 'The Sea and the Rhythm,' is better than this. Yes, this is his third album, not his second. But not to worry. A guy with this much talent will give us another good album, I'm sure."
2,ZZZZZzzzzzzz...,"Oh my, what can I say about this whispery little train wreck. It's third-rate coffee house music that struggles to be heard over conversations (as it should be). In the quiet sanctuary of my den, it's revealed for all it isn't. It isn't clever, musically or lyrically, and just drones along seemingly forever. My audiophile friends would like it because the sparse notes and little extraneous noises would make their overly analytical and fatiguing systems sound magical.Unless you're into performances that sound influenced by heavy doses of thorazine, don't bother."
1,don't believe the hype,"This recording should be sent to every dentist in the country. Musak for people who like to think they have taste, forced breathy singing (""Hey I'm as talented as Nick Drake"") forced steel string guitar squeeks (""Wow, what a lifelike recording"") pathetic Hallmark quality lyrics (""Hey I took a creative writing course, really""), and just to make you feel comfy, the songs are redundant. ""The art of saying things well is useless to a man who has nothing to say"" -Macaulay"
5,Wonderful,"Touching and poetic lyrics, beautifully crafted songs, hauntingly brilliant vocals and harmonies, not overly produced as some acoustic albums can be, thoughtful guitar lines, and variety between tracks."
2,Cute charm,It's cute but falls apart too easily. The tinkle bell gets on my nerves and my caller can hear it each time I move the phone. I put it on my purse as a zipper pull and it fell apart with in a few days. For the price it's cute though.
5,Historical Page Turner,"Murdered by His Wife by Deborah Navas is at once a gripping ""Gothic"" page-turner and a solid piece of scholarly research. Navas writes in an elegant, clear and concise manner. A fine balance is sustained between objective, documented reporting and carefully considered interpretation which is never allowed to override the facts. The book is packed with information including fascinating transcripts of eighteenth century testimony. While the narrative stands on its own as a riveting drama that will appeal to the general public, the book should be of special interest to historians,legal historians, feminists sociologists and psychologists. In my opinion this is a landmark book."
5,Incredibly shocking,Hard to believe this happened and so close to home! Exceptionally detailed account!
1,Rhapsody in White C/D a disappointment.,"I have the vinyl LP of Rhapsody In White. It's loaded with wonderful songs...10 of them . I decided to order the CD version. What a huge disappointment that was!! Only 8 songs of which only 3 are from the original LP release. I think this is very misleading to a buyer when they use the same cover from the LP for the CD. I guess I should have tried to find out what songs were on this CD before I ordered it but how would I have figured out this rip-off when they made the CD version using the original cover of the LP version?? As with ALL of Barry White's music regardless, you will enjoy whatever songs are on any album. I guess I will have to search for all the songs from the Rhapsody LP, buy them from either iTunes (and that still doesn't have all those songs either) or buy other CDs and then put them on a playlist to burn my own ""Rhapsody In White"" CD. Anyway, whoever had the ""bright"" idea of this CD rip-off shame on you!!"
3,Barry White,"What woman doesn't love this music. I've had my vinyl album since it came out but decided to replace it with a CD. It's old and mostly instrumental but still good. ""Barry's Theme"" is my favorite. Feeling nostalgic? Like Barry White? You'll enjoy the CD."
3,Boomer Sooner,Kinda cheap plastic helmets for the checker pieces. I bought it for display rather than to actually use so it will be okay.
4,pretty book,"this is a paperback, not a hard cover. and for the price from a used dealer, i thought it would be hard back. but the colors are vivid, the book is not used at all. i 'm glad i have it and intend to collect this series. oh, and the hard cover thing is due to my not carefully reading the description.i'd buy here again."
2,"""Like new""?","This book was advertised as being in ""like new"" condition and it is far from it. Both the cover and the pages are well worn."
4,excellent buy,"The tool itself gets 5 stars, but overall loses a star because of packaging. This tool crimps very well and gives pro results but once the dies are removed from their plastic storage positions in the box, it becomes a challenge to store them all again.This is a minor annoyance at home while inspecting the tool but on the job site this becomes a problem."
4,Great product,Produces high quality crimps.Replaced all the wiring connectors in my older car and this tool proved a necessity.I had used the normal hand crimpers but these work much more effectively.A guide printed on the inside cover as to which crimp is for what terminal would have helped.
3,"Didn't work for me, but seemed like a solid option","I needed a crimper for WeatherPack terminals. I believe this tool would be great for the Metripack terminals or any other insulated or non-insulated connectors. The problem was that this is built as a ""double-action"" crimper, meaning the tool is designed to make both the connector crimp and insulation crimp in the same movement.When the tension was tight enough to make an effective connector, or wire, crimp, it would destroy the weather pack sleeve because it was too tight. When it was loose enough to save the sleeve, it did not make an effective connector crimp.Ratcheting action was great. Adjustments were easy. Tool felt solid and well built. Think this would probably make a much better crimp than anything from an auto parts or hardware store. All of the teeth were solid, although I did not try any other connectors.Storage box was a bit of a pain to use. Seemed like i could never get the teeth back in their slots correctly."
3,Crimper problem with OEM open barrel crimps,Crimper is a double crimper which requires a large squeezing force to crimp bare wire and insulation simultaneously.A single crimp insert which would only crimp either the wire or the insulation at one time would be better.Do you have a jaw insert for open barrel OEM crimps that will fit the 18900 tool in my kit?
5,Wonderful multipurpose tool!,"Great, compact, versatile tool set. Worth every penny (which is many pennies less than other sets). The case is great to store the unused parts in until you need them. This little set has everything I know I currently need, and some that I'll probably need in the future for my line of work. Quick, easy head changes, and sturdy tool. Super fast shipping, packed well. A+ from this gal."
5,Great value,Installed a new wiring harness in my classic car and needed to make up a lot of connections. This kit was great for all the sizes I needed.
4,The Drifters All time Greatest Hits,"All the original cuts , sound it excellent ,and from original artist. I would make this recommedation for anybody in the 50-60 music collectors."
4,A real nice cd,I like the cd very much but some song I liked was not on there. So four stars is my rating
2,Too Few Tracks,I was disappointed in the CD as it has too few of their wonderful recordings. I must check other other CD's and I am sure I will find a more complete product.
3,"An anachronistic rant against ""the system.""","H. Rap Brown has been called the african-american Jim Goad. In Mr. Brown's case, however, his screed is directed not at women and liberals but instead at ""honkeys,"" ""crackers"" and, of course, ""THE MAN!"" This autobiography gives the reader insight into the anger that fueled one man's efforts to bring down ""the system."" Overall, though, the book is kinda insubstantial and considering the darn thing cost nearly 15 bones, there are much better books on the subject."
4,"After Molson, The Best Thing Canada's Ever Produced....","Decent compilation, even though it really tails off after track 8. My advice would be to save your cash on this one and pluck down the extra money on the 2 disc ""BTO Anthology"" set."
4,"Oh, the good ol' days","Made in USA in 2000, Serial# 314-548-096-2, Playing Time 53:51This CD lifts songs from the band up to their 10th album, ""Rock N' Roll Nights"", released back in 1979.Some great songs, a lot of hits. Just a bit disappointed that the people at Universal couldn't come up with another 20 minutes of material.BTO isn't about musicianship: it's about non-pretentious, simple but footstompin' energy, with ordinary sounds but fun to listen to. Who hasn't heard ""Takin' Care Of Business"" ?Put the CD in, press the play button, and prepare yourself for about an hour of pleasure. If you like rock from the 70's, this one's a treat!"
5,BTO,"I have been a big fan of Bachman, Turner Overdrive since I was a teenager. I still like their music and I am thorougly enjoying this CD. Although the music that I listened to are considered Golden Oldies, I still like to listen to my favorite groups. Since I cannot find those kinds of music in CD's except on Amazon.com, I purchase them when I can. I still have all of my LP's and 45's, but CD versions are better!"
4,Enjoyable and brings back memories,"BTO had a sound and it was great to hear the old tunes and bring back memories and sing along...not all of the tunes I knew, but enjoyable."
4,FIGHTINGFALCON1685@YAHOO.COM,THIS IS TRUE ROCK N ROLL FROM MY ERA. I GREW UP WITH THE SIXTIES ROCK AND ROLL. TRULY A TRIBUTE TO AND WITH THE REST OF THAT ERA.......
3,"OKAY, Some good material.",I was never really a fan of this group but does have some good songs. Sound quality is great. I'm sure some better songs could have been added to this than what is now part of the album.
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK EVER. IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF $86, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPEND ON STUDYING FOR THE SAT AND PROCURING MY PHD FROM THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF DIVINITY. I'VE READ SO MANY BETTER BOOKS THAN THIS, SUCH AS MARY KATE AND ASHLEY ""DETECTIVE ADVENTURES"", BOXCAR CHILDREN, AND FULLHOUSE!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK WAS A COMPLETE DISSAPOINTMENT, AND THUS I AM ENRAGED!!!!!! THIS IS NOT MEANT FOR MAINSTREAM CULTURE LIKE ME, AND ONLY FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF VETERAN AFFAIRS FOR MACEDONIA. PEACE"
3,Best of ? L.T.D. Not really.,"There are too many omissions such as ""Concentrate On You""""Love To The World"" ""Lady Love""(good-bye)not to be confused withthe Lou Rawls song with the same name and too much filler. I neverheard of ""April Love"" ""Kickin' Back"" Save your money for the greatest hits."
1,REMASTERING WAS NOT GOOD,"THIS CD WAS REMASTERED AND I MUST SAY THAT IT WAS A BAD JOB. THE LAST 2 TRACKS BEGAN AT 45 & 48 SECS. THERE WAS NO BEGINNING,NO INTRO TO THE SONGS. I WISH I HAD THE OPTION TO ORDER THE ORIGINAL HOWEVER, THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE."
5,PL Cook,"These are artist that I cherish. You do not find this kind of music everywhere; but, thanks to you, Amazon.Com for making this type of music available. I am completely satisfied with all the products I buy from Amazon. Keep up the good works!"
5,smooth,Dove beauty bar's are the best soap for our family's dry skin.This packaging allows me to have enough on hand so I don't run out and have to buy them at a much higher price at our local stores.
5,A special holiday tradition,My family listened to this book on tape every year as a family. It became a very special holiday tradition for us and should be shared.
3,Still the best version of the Forgotten Carols,"My CD copy was to old the sound was messed up, jerking from too loud to too soft. But it's still better than the McClean more modern version which guts the musical and serious tone of this fabulous parable for Christmas"
5,"tomorrow,will i again go free","Amazing in 01 that ppl still listen to this. but im not surprised. Very good . Early HOldsworth ,heavy licks for then and now. A very talented group of musicians ,with jon hiseman of colosseum fame. Not much air in usa at time. Also check out Jade Warrior another group ahead of the pack/"
5,a must-get,"this is one of the best comics i've ever read. it's about manji's job as a bodyguard for rin, who confronts Anotsu Kagehisa, who killed rin's father. she attemps to kill him, but does she really even stand a chance?this book was explosive and had a mix of action and explaining of the story for people who did not read any other of the Blade of the immortal series."
5,BIG,My husband loves them because of their size and durability. He hated all the little 'thin' domino's on the market.
2,Don't hold up,"These gloves say they have 'Superior Puncture and Abrasion Resistance', but they are not as strong as others we have used."
3,Interview with Jarmusch is good,The cover guy does give an exclusive interview from the Cannes Film Festival - overall superficial but interesting if you're a fan of his.
4,New WPPSI,"I purchased the new WPPSI-III. The WPPSI-III is different from the WPPSI-R. The book Essentials of WPPSI-III Assessment helped me to understand the differences in the subtests and the differences in administration. Also, the book helps in analysis of the scores. Perhaps the best thing about the book is that it written in clear language without too much jargon. There are summaries throughout the book that make finding information easy."
4,Thursday at noon review,"William Brown, author of ""Amongst My Enemies"" and several other books, He somehow made a action packed thriller in ""Thursday at Noon.""William Brown has real people and other made up people to make a page turning story. You can never tell who's gonna get who next!! You cant help but to turn the page and see where William Brown is gonna take you.If you you like gripping page turners, and thrillers this is the book for you!! Thursday at noon has action, suspense and conspiracy all in one! There's never a dull moment and a must have for anyone that's into suspense thrillers!!"
5,Another Winner!,"Brown has penned another great read! This story pulls you in and won't let go -- taking you through twists and turns you could never predict. As in the other Brown novels I have read, it was hard to read quickly enough to learn about what would happen next. The CIA, Embassy appointments, the religious fanaticism in parts of the Middle East and even the Nazis, all play into the plot. Though it was set in the early 1960's, the reader might easily imagine it happening in today's world. Following washed-up CIA operative Richard Thomson as he snakes his way into a foreign government is an unparalleled rush. References to the Bay of Pigs and the Kennedy administration create a brilliant historical slant. I am looking forward to the next book Brown will share with Kindle readers!"
4,Trampoline Man Enjoyable Music,I am a gymnastics coach and I am always looking for music to play in the gym that is appropriate to my business and clientele. I previewed a song from this CD online and took the risk of ordering the whole CD. I am pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the whole CD is and I am glad that I made the purchase. The kids have commented on hearing a song about trampolining while we train on the trampoline. It has a circus feel and makes for great music to play in my gym that is family friendly.
3,Billy Rose's Jumbo,"I was a little disappointed in this film. Even though it had Jimmy Durane and Martha Raye [ two stars I have enjoyed in the past ] , the movie was not that good. I will continue to purchase ANY Doris Day movies that I don't already have as I am able. The film itself was received on time from Amazon.com."
5,"Jumbo, the movie","Doris Day and Jimmy Durante in circus musical from the 1930's. Durante seems miscast as the circus owner, although he played the original role on Broadway. His short stature and unattractive face is sharp contrast to tall and beautiful Doris Day, his movie daughter. I bought this to see the setting for the song Little Girl Blue, a favorite tune of mine. I wasn't disappointed with the music in the film, and it was enjoyable enough as an opportunity to see past stars do their stuff."
4,"Hopelessly corny, but great nonetheless","If you are looking for a light hearted, uplifting, and entertaining classic, then this is the one to see. Jimmy Durante is always at his best, especially as a circus owner, and his affection for an elephant named, Jumbo. Doris Day is also wonderful, as always. This movie has it all, romance, a little action, comedy, and a lot of good fun. An endearing movie that won my heart over, despite it's predictable corny scenes. I definitely recommend at least renting it."
5,the singings good enuf but the guitar is what its all about,"I saw Foley live when she was a shy 22-year-old, and my opinion hasn't changed: Her singing's ok, good enough to keep her out of the financial hell that blues sidemen suffer in, but her guitar playing is is tops. Foley had an in-depth understanding of the greats, and built her style on the best of foundations; T-bone Walker, Freddy King, etc. I must insist that she would probably wail beyond her best so far if she had an equal vocalist to push her."
5,Guitar Heaven,"I listen to alot of guitar music and I am putting track 6 on my all time favorite list. Fat slide sound, fast picking, nice changes, cruising music, catchy melody."
5,Dog Good,"Since I work out of my house I spend hours a day listening to music and Levee Town has become my favorite CD. It is a stunning achievement by slide master, Sonny Landreth. Sonny is a masterful poet and has incorporated any number of regional musical influences into his songs while still making them uniquely his own. I can't stop dancing to USS Zydecomobile."
3,Not my favorite CD from Sonny,This CD is definately not my favorite from Sonny. A couple of decent tracks but overall not the best in my book.
4,The 2-disc version is silly!,"Although this is a solid album, squarely in the Landreth tradition of swampy cajun/zydeco/slide blues, the 2-disc version is ridiculous: Together the two discs only total 73:57, and thus they could clearly have been combined onto one album, with bonus tracks!"
1,"No, no, no... misses the mark completely.","Poorly put together book. Just one example concerns adding a TurboNet ethernet board to a Tivo Series One. I did this myself last year with no book - only info from the Internet. This book claims you have no choice but to hack the software to accomodate TurboNet when in fact, TurboNet drivers are already built into the latest Tivo software. Also fails to cover using the board with standard ""off the shelf"" wireless ethernet bridges. I'm not impressed at all. Way too convoluted."
2,Not for novices,"This book is poorly organized. It has you flipping all through the book and leaving you frustrated as where to begin. I am not a novice. I am a computer programmer with win2000, xp and linux machines and still couldn't figure out where the 3.x tivo kernel is for the 2 Kernel monte method of getting a command prompt on the series 2. This is required to get anything to work on that system. It mentions nothing about mounting specific partitiions (4,7,9) in order to get your drive mounted to your machine. This book needed some serious usability testing from people who haven't hacked a series 2 before. I guess it will make for some good paper for my fireplace. Wait until something better comes out or find better info for free on the internet (which I had to do to get everything working)."
2,Hands on review,"CAUTION!!! Just finished upgrading the hard drive on my Series 1 TiVo. This book was full of errors and outdated information. Had I not bought Jeff Keegan's ""Hacking TiVo"" book at the same time as this book, I would have a TiVo boat anchor by now. Luckily, I am the cautious type and read both books before I started. I don't think the author, William von Hagen even proof read his work before it was published. Besides giving wrong information on setting up larger disk caches etc. the book was littered with lots of small typos such as MB instead of GB etc.I did give this book an extra star for the user friendly language and explinations and the larger sized type. Jeff Keegan's book is a lot more technical, has less detailed explinations and smaller type."
4,A great reference for amateurs and experts alike,"Despite it's relative blandness (no illustrations and a boring font) This book is an interesting read (though some entries were not there i.e.: Glasya, troglodye, etc- but- you can't have it all).Page after page you learn something new about your garden variety supaernatural occurences and characters and much more.This volume has the advantage of not being corrupted by the mass media perception of the occult.Definitely a book that I would not put down for a while."
2,Doubtful Completeness,"I cannot find the word ""egregore""... and hence I doubt the book is good enough to be called an encyclopedia of occultism. Anyone who knows occultism well will find terms here and there missing in this so-called most complete encyclopedia."
2,Disappointing - Not Complete,"I expect it to be comprehensive. After all, the title includes the word ""Encyclopedia"". Those that are knowledgeable in the occult will find this book incomplete.I don't think it is worth even to call it a ""dictionary""."
1,UMMMMMM,"Amazon??? You should let us know if this is a music cd or an interview disc...I got it thinking it was music....it's interviews.....I love lennon though!!12/19/05-I typed this review way back in `99 0r 2000, when there wasn't any information about it. Since then, amazon has added the information/track line up...thank you very much amazon for the added information...I am still upset that it's an interview disc though :)"
3,Great in the way he till it like it is Lennon is peace,I fell history has only been kind to john only for his music. But the minute he start's talking about peace we turn a blind ear We all want peace it was. just we did'nt want john to tell us an ex- beatles of all people.I enjoyed hearing him talk it was go for the record co. to get it out there.
4,The X-MEN Compilation,"This book is not bad and beats the Spiderman Ultimate Guide too. But I think taht with the X-Men characters they didn't give too well a 'modern' bio, like what's happening with them right now (although they explained the sagas, timelines and timezones perfectly though I think they should've done a little more. A near omission to the Toad is one of these examples. He should've been included in the chapter 'other 60's villains' instead of being given a backseat to the chapter the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. These little things make little differences and its overall a very good book."
2,I'm only saying 2 because some people might actually like it,"I checked out this book at my library because it sounded pretty interesting, even though I was told it was for die hard fans only. I pretty much consider myself that. But even I found this book completely...pointless. The stories had either no plot or a pathetic one. If it hadn't been for the names I never would have thought it an X-men book."
2,Great Characters--Zero Plot,"As a die-hard X-Men fan I had to pick up this trade paperback. Taking the X-Men out of a visual comic form allows more to be written. It gives writers a great opportunity to flesh out these colorful characters. Unfortunately, the anthology format ensured that no plot would survive. Each story is averaging 20 pages. In order to accomodate such a shortage of paper, the writer has to present a plot, flesh it out, and resolve it on the turn of a dime. I was frustrated halfway through the book at the stilted writing and lame ending after ending after ending. This book does get two stars. One, because it is afterall the X-Men, and two--it does focus on a variety of heroes. If you want X-Men fiction that won't leave you unsatisfied, I recommend checking out those novels written by Christopher Golden. (The Mutant Empire Trilogy is nicely written.)"
4,A Provocative Read!,"A wonderful collection of short stories about kids who are ""outsiders"" which can facilitate some great discussions both in the home and in the classroom. The stories are written by well-known YA authors and many readers, both old and young, will easily relate to the universal situation of those in the ""in-group"" versus those ""on the fringe."""
1,Throw it away,I thought the book was a bunch of bolagna. I didnt care for it at all and someone should burn it. The only reason i liked it was because it had a bunch of short stories and not just one big book with a bunch of chapters. It had a lot of truth in it which is the only good part of the book. The book was basically about kids that dont fit in and are outsiders. Who ever get's this bpok should throw it away or tearit and burn it into peices.
2,I want the whole thing.,"The picture and sound quality aren't bad. Although, the earlier videos were shot on film and it would have been nice if they had cleaned them up a little. There are a few songs missing. Worst of all, the very beginning and end of each song is clipped/covered by a graphic providing title and year. The music starts and after a few beats the graphic slides off, and then it slides back in before the song is over. If I'm paying for a whole video I want to see the whole video."
2,Disappointed,"I saw this on the racks in Hong Kong but frankly the sight of the poor reproduction on the cover (it's a US copy) put me off from buying it.ABC was a favourite band of mine from the past and it's great to see it being re-released on DVD....but the collection is far from complete. The song ""The Real Thing"" is missing and there's no extras at all. The sound doesn't even seem to be remixed....If only those concerned who had the heart of putting it out again just add a bit more effort into it. Perhaps the UK version could do a better job?"
5,at the drive-in: Relationship of Command,"This is a jaw-droppingly good metal/punk album. The whole CD blazes with energy. They remind me a lot of awesome live Fugazi and Janes Addiction shows, back in the day. They have a really fresh sound, really cool guitar experimentation - not more of the same detuned Korn-type metal guitar. This CD really works its way into your head. The word must be getting out about these guys - They're on a long european/world tour now. I can't wait 'til they get back to the states. If they sound this good on record, the live show will probably knock you down. If you're a metal fan, and you've never heard of At the drive-in, take a chance on this one."
3,Hype Machine,"The hype machine revving up for this El Paso quintet is nearly as deafening as the frantic rock these guys crank out. They're passionate, so comparisons are often made to Rage Against the Machine and Fugazi. Those are apt, but more to the point would be Shudder to Think and Gang of 4. The songs on Relationship of Command are like hectoring seizures; they keep you shaking when you'd much rather stop. The lyrics don't help - obscure and pretentious, occasionally hitting a powerful image they chant into the ground. Singer Cedric has a forceful set of pipes; the band is so tight it squeaks. They might be a force to reckon with when they calm down enough to focus."
4,amazon is incorrect,The release date is September 12th 2000. Not what they have printed. Amazon please fix this
4,A awesome rap/rock band,This is 1 of the best bands ive heard in a while. They sound a lot like Rage Against The Machine but the only problem with this cd is that there singer really cant rap. I'm not dissing the dude or anything but if u stack his rapping skills up 2 Fred Durst or Zach from RATM then ull see that he really cant rap 2 good. Its a good cd thouhg and u need 2 get this be4 they sellout n e more. Ive been a fan of this band sinse day 1 and teenyboppers are starting 2 like them.
1,Dissapoining,"This album is incredibly dissapointing. The songs sound all the same, and it gets old fast. The lyrics are horrible, and the lead singer dishes them out in a really strange and unpleasing fashon. Stay away from this one and spend your 15 bucks on a good Rage Against The Machine cd."
3,Future? Maybe. 1989? Yup.,"At The Drive in comes to me with heavy buzz about them. Touring with Rage, indie darlings, etc... My first reaction to the disc was, ""Fugazi called, they want their songs back."" But wait, I haven't liked anything they've done since Repeater, which is where ATDI pick things up in a new direction (one Ian and co. should have taken in my book). Songs are okay, vocalist isn't going to last long on the road tearing his throat up like that. It's too bad, he has a nice voice when he chooses to uses it. Production is a pretty weak, just bad quality for what is available gear-wise these days. I wholeheartedly believe that this band will blow me away live, but on record they sound a little flat and hardcore retro. But hey, there's a lot worse out there."
5,Nay - sayers beat it!,"I cannot believe that some people actually do not like this CD. I am scratching my head, because they either like metal, or rap, or they are too young to know what punk music is. I have been around this scene for 20 years and I know good music when I hear it. At The Drive In is punk at it's finest... they totally make me spaz!"
3,rambling,"Good album, incasinoout was a bit better. My only problem with ATDI despite their rocking shows is the lyrics. Yes you can say nonsensical lyrics are just too deep for lamens to read. But with the exception of some of the songs in one interview I read they just make the words up when they sound good. But than again, emo is the land of vague lyrics so we'll make do."
5,Emotional Blitzkrieg,"Every now and then you listen to a song that makes every hair on your arm stand on end. This is the case with almost every song on ATDI's new release ""Relationship of Command"". This hardworking band has received much critical acclaim recently and deservedly so. This is passionate music that demands your attention from the get go and doesn't let up until the last cut. Aggressive yet filled with passionate hooks and underlying melodicism within its blitzkrieg arsenal of sound. I heard this is one of the best live bands around and I can definitely see why. I'm sure this album captures the raw intensity of the band's live show. Very strong songwriting with a bold emotional assault on the senses makes ""Relationship of Command"" one of the best releases of 2000 and a force to listened to repeatedly to fully understand. Essential."
2,Dont believe the hype,"Maybe I'll be drawn and quartered for this, but this is their weakest effort. Just because it had the ""best"" producer, biggest budget, and they had a cookie cutter three and a half minute song with a chorus sung 8,000 times on MTV doesn't mean this is an album of the decade. Honestly it took me three times before I could even get through the first half of this record. I found it that unimpressive. And still do. Its slightly above generic alt rock or whatever the hell MTV would label this as. If you're going to get any ATDI, please do yourself a favor and get Vaya and In/Casino/Out, then Acrobatic Tenements third. Actually, don't even bother with this one at all."
5,"Intense, Sad, Happy, Excelent",This is undoubtably one of the best albums of 2000. From the opening track 'Arcarsenel' with the screaming of 'Beware' all the way to the excelent final track 'Catacombs' you are taken on an intense journey. This album was prodused by Ross Robinson (Slipknot et al) and he has done a great job holding the album together. The single 'One Armed Scissor; and the scary kidnapping song 'Enfilade' are the best on the album. You generly cant understand what the vocalist is saying due to the Zach De La Rocha like shouting through the album but this just adds to the intnsity of the album and all the lyrics are printed in the liner notes for anyone intrested in the great writing by the band. Buy it now anyone sick of the predictibility of nu-metal.
4,Truly wonderful album,"Before listening to this album I was quite skeptical (""Don't believe the hype""), but after giving Relationship of Command a chance, my faith in modern music (and modern rock critics) had been restored. ATDI delivers as many lyrical non-sequiturs as a Beck or Ghostface album, and as much ferocity as The Smashing Pumpkins at their tortured best. Both beautiful and menacing, Relationship of Command leaves little room for ambiguity. Like works from such artists as Albert Ayler, Frank Zappa or The Stooges, either you ""get it"" or you don't. The bottom line: if you are keen to experiment, and take pleasure in discovering art (any form of art) that makes a demand on you the audience, then this album will not disappoint. Relationship of Command is as much a mental challenge as it is a wonderfully visceral experience."
5,ATDI : le meilleur band,"C'est clair que at the drive-in est le meilleur band que j'ai entendue jusqu'a maintenant. Le cd relationship on command est surement le meilleur cd fait par at the drive-in. C'est vraiment chiant qu'ils ont splités en 2 groupes dont : sparta (Jim, Paul et tony) et The Mars Volta (Cedric et Omar). At the drive in est une légendre de la music, personne va pouvoir reproduire ce qu'ils ont fait. J'espère juste qu'il vont revenir ensemble un jour. Et pour les gros fans, je vous conseille d'acheter le cd VAYA qui ressemble beaucoup à relationship on command."
3,The short awakening of Punk,"This album has a very powerful initial effect. The Sheer energy and intensity of this band is mind blowing. They make Rage Against the machine sound like a bunch of old whining veterans. When i first bought this album i listened to it daily, but the novelty soon wore off. The same thing happened with System of a Downs Toxicity. Most of the songs do contain strong melodies and hooks, but they are hidden by a thick wall of distorted cacophony. It just becomes too grating to listen to. Enfilade is still a brilliant song and is one of the best songs i've heard of the new millenium. Relationship of command is great accomplishment for At the drive-in. It gained them some much deserved recognition and hype. Unfortunately it remains as one of those albums i'm proud to own but never really listen to. I would still see them live though, if they decided to re-unite."
4,At the Drive-In is where it all started,"Omar's high woman-ish but extremely awsome voice hasn't quite shown itself that much in this CD. Songs like ""Mannequin Republic"" and ""Non-zero possibility"" are probably what got him the idea for Mars Volta. If thats you'r favorite part about At the Drive-In you should definitly look into some Mars Volta. But don't think of them as an ""underdeveloped Mars Volta"" because they differ in many ways and have more of a EMO style."
3,Nice - shame about the voice,"The tunes on this great album are incredibly good. Nice guitar and lots and lots of effects and crap. However, the pants lyrics and his frankly annoying voice just put me off this totally. I know that some people like it, but I hate it. He screams too too much but it would be alright if he didn;t do it so badly. In track 12, he 'sings' a bit lower than usual and it helps. It sounds really good. I think it is when he says 'hate you' Nothing really wrong with this album apart from that blokes voice. Listen to some f it and make up your mind on his voice. If you think that it's good, chances are you will like this album. However, massive Kurt Cobain voice fans will hate this."
5,Cerebral hard rock with over the top energy...,"Best described as cerebral hard rock with over the top energy. If you enjoy King Crimson or Rage Against The Machine, than you should find something to appreciate with At The Drive-In who consists of two members of Mars Volta and three members of Sparta. My favorite cuts are the hyperactive ""One Armed Scissor"", ""Invalid Litter Department"" with the haunting lyric ""Dancing On The Corpses Ashes"", the punk song ""Rolodex"" with Iggy Pop on guest vocals, and the very apocalyptic ""Quarantined"" with it powerful wall of guitars. These guys were exceptional, passionate musicians."
4,At the CD player,"Influential neo-punk rockers' finest sonic sucker-punch to the gut may not tear down the house like it used to upon youthful debut, but certainly remains uniquely powerful enough to qualify serious space in any adventurous heavy music fan's collection."
4,pretty good,"This is a good album. Being a big Mars Volta fan, I find a lot to like about it. Its no MV though. Its like being in the car on the way to the beach when you really want to be at the beach."
5,One Armed Scissor is good enough for a purchase as it is!,"This CD is awesome. Serious hardcore music. ATDI remind me of Rage Against the machine, but with so much ENERGY! Buy this CD, its cheap, cool, and just something good to listen to."
3,BOOM!!!,"This record really is just like a bomb that's ready to explode. The band has that level of energy and audacity. Unfortunately, once bombs explode there isn't much reason to keep them, is there?"
2,dancing on el paso's ashes,"i wouldnt really say these guys are from el paso anymore. i mean its safe to say that they really arent going to claim recedency there again. this album only has about 5 good songs. 1,2,3,4,10. but even those seem like they are going to wear thin on me in time to come. cedrics lyrics are laughable sometimes and the album in general is overproduced. try not to get me wrong im extremely proud of these guys. i just think they should try to start from scratch on their new album. and please cedric i hear you're a big a coke head. try to cut it out and dont scream so much. i was showing one these songs to my father and he just laughed and shook his head. over time i understood more and more why he laughed."
1,MC5 ...,"This has to be the most overrated, overhyped, talentless bandin the world. At the drive in is one talentless band. They clearly[replicate] their stage antics and hair styles from the great MC5."
5,the future of all music,"Put quite simply, this is an absolutely incredible album. The way it conveys emotions just through raw musical power AND intelligence is amazing. These guys represent what is to come for music: total artistic freedom, the way it was supposed to be in the first place. Everyone who enjoys, plays or respects any form of music should listen to this.Its so sad but also good in a way that they broke up; it would have been even worse if they had broken the mainstream and been manipulated by major labels and money.Nirvana? Rolling Stones? The Beatles? No. In my opinion ATDI beat the socks off them all musically, ideologically, and originality."
5,Crawls under your skin,"When I first heard this album, my first exposure to the band, I loved the music but hated the guys voice. Now with only a few more listens, the voice is the main reason I cannot stop listening. It's what makes it like nothing I've ever heard, sonic and soaring, yet warm and sincere.Crawls under you skin, and lives there."
3,Too hyped.,"RELATIONSHIP OF COMMAND is a decent disc-I can tell there is some real talent in there, but it seems that most of the tracks are buried under the bands pretentious, overwrought songwriting. I enjoyed about half of the tunes, the rest just bored me. I won't say 'disorganized', but I'm not sure how to describe the bizarre 'sructures' of some of this album. I listen to other material that is more chaotic than this, so it's not that I don't understand what's happening here-I just am not interested in it. The vocals are ok, but a bit grating over time. Not my thing, but I know many others like it. I still give them the benefit of the doubt-I will wait for the next album and give them another try. This just strikes me as noisy-almost noise for noise's sake."
5,Good Music,"This is a great CD! Go to their concert to see them in action. ""rock's latest saviors"" -Rolling Stone (aug. issue) need I say more?"
5,He Writes with an air of Experience,"It seems that the Java community has been so fast in developing new tools to assist in system development that it's hard to keep track. In fact, it almost seems that you could spend virtually all your working time on just reading the big thick manuals that each new development seems to require. And then when you want some guidence on which took you should use on any particular project you are faced with an almost religious ferver as to this one vs. that one.This book is a practical guide to using the new lightweight frameworks with POJO's (Plain Old Java Objects). It gives you an overview of Hibernate, JDO and Spring. More important, is that it defines the features of each with relation to the others. That in, for this kind of thing use this one, and for that kind of thing, use that one.It's clear that Mr. Richardson has used these programs to develop real applications and he shares his knowledge well."
5,A pragmatic guide to the POJO approach,"This is an excellent book for enterprise Java developers to get the best out of the POJO approach. ""POJOs in Action"" has done an exceedingly good job of covering a broad range of technologies (Spring, AOP, Hibernate, JDO, iBatis, etc.) and concepts (domain-driven design, dependency injection, AOP, unit testing, etc.) in a simple yet comprehensive manner. The code samples make the material useful in the real world applications. Further, this book contains many nuggets of information such as recovering from concurrency failures during a transaction and managing offline locking.I highly recommend this book."
5,it has 560 pages?,"Computer books today can go beyond 500+ pages way too easily, it's hard to understand what these editors are doing:-), for me most books can be reduced to half without loss any meaningful content. But this book is an exception! It's very practical, cover lots of area in a clean, easy reading style. Every page deserves the paper. really enjoy it. Note you need Marven to build the source code, which I think it's too much for exmaple code."
2,"useless book about pojos in context of spring, ejb, hibernate and jdo","the book lightly covers the use of pojo in spring, ejb, hibernate, and jdo. the coverage of each topic is like say 30-40%. you are probably better of getting spring and hibernate books to get complete picture of pojos in spring and hibernate. all in all, this book is pure waste of time and shouldn't exist at all."
4,good,"i thought this was a very good book. it had just the right amount of suspense, supernatural and romance to make it this way. Elizabeth Chandler is an amazing author and has proved that in her writing. Dark Secrets is a very good series and i recomend it to anyone, not just teens."
1,No worthy,"The movie arrived without cover art and rendered useless. When I bought this from the seller's store, there was no indication that this dvd will arrived without a cover art. I requested for cover art but refused."
3,Vampire Twist...,"Been a watcher of horror for years and thought that this flick had some interesting twists and turns to the usual vampire plot.Acting was acceptable as were the effects.Would recommend as a good sit back with the lights out independent. Somewhat suspenseful, blood thirsty, keep the vampires from controlling the world movie !!!"
2,Imcomplete,The CD's which are required as a part of our class are not part of this book as they would be if ordered through the university bookstore.
4,another fitment not listed,"This does fit a 78 cb400a hondamatic , by reversing the direction of the fork clamps. This model doesnt appear on the fit chart so maybe this will help someone. Nice quality to the hardware, a nice improvement with glare on the gauges with the gradient black, and no buffeting once you get the angle dialed in. I think this would fit a lot of old riceburner cruisers by the big 3 jap makers. I gave it a 4 because the hardware is blister packed labeled ""opened parts cannot be returned for credit"" . You cant tell for sure in some cases whether or not it will fit before opening so, youre rolling the dice abit. I got lucky and mine fit. But, if you arent as lucky you will have to eat the cost of the hardware kit."
4,Project Management Review,"This book was required for one of my graduate courses. However, I found it to be very useful reference book for software development project management. Boring read, but mandatory for anyone who wants to learn more about project management."
4,Incredibly Helpful Do's and Don'ts,"If you are involved with software development projects, reading and applying the advice in this book can make the difference between on-time completion or never-ending redevelopment. McConnell covers the entire development cycle and presents his successfully tested methods.He begins by outlining the mind-set that is required to complete the software development project. He then follows the cycle from planning to implementation to wrap-up."
4,Good but Light,"This was good, but a little light. I have really liked the author's other works and so I expected a lot from this. Maybe that was part of it. I could not give this five stars because it was a little light on details, especially at the end. However, there is a lot of good project information here, from years of experience. Just the fact that it is not huge is a good thing -- too many 40-page books are turned into 600-page tomes so they give an aura of respectability.If you are new to software project management, this is an excellent book to start with (five stars). If you want to get a quick refresher on good ways to run a project, with some modern-day approaches, this is also good. Give it a try."
3,Good but not the best,"First, note that this book is enjoyed by a great many people. Also, I am not a project manager. However, I read this book for an IT course in project management, as well as another book. The other book I read was called ""IT Project Management"" (2nd Ed.), by Kathy Schwalbe and I enjoyed it much more than McConnell's book. I thought it was a more comprehensive guide to project management, apparently.McConnell's book is presented well though, and fairly easy to understand. The section on Software Architecture is good."
4,Well thought out and practical advice on managing projects,"The guidelines and practices put forth in this book are practical, and are a common sense approach to Project management. I have worked with teams using many of the techniques on previous projects, with a high degree of success. The one area I find missing in the staged approach is the handling of overlapped work where some items take much longer to complete than any single stage. Users should review this staged approach to be sure it can work on their specific project. Otherwise I highly recommend this book."
3,A disappointment after excellent predecessors,"I read Code Complete and Rapid Development and was trilled. Survival Guide is not in the same league as them. I think that the author feel in love with process and describes an ideal project that doesn't exist. That is the source of my disappointment since his other books were delightfully pragmatic and useful.If you landed in nearly doomed project and you want a real survival guide, use chapter Project recovery in Rapid Development or even better, use whole book."
5,Excellent guide to basic project management,"I've read McConnell's other books and I think that they are excellent. This book contains alot of the same information as Rapid Software Development, but it has much more of a slant towards applying the ideas. I think that anybody involved in software development should read this book."
4,Common sense approach for all projects,"Most of us have been involved with software projects that we would just as soon forget--or at least run away from screaming. If you want to learn how software projects should be run, or how to run one correctly yourself, then Steve McConnell presents a straightforward, common-sense approach that can be applied to all types of projects. The companion web site provides a complete collection of templates to support all aspects of managing a software project."
3,Survival Guide Lives Up To Its Title!,"The Survival Guide lives up to its title. It is a practical guide that is readily usable by projects on the factory floor. It succeeds by providing the minimum essential prescription for success in software projects. If you lack experience in managing a software project, the Survival Guide is there for you. Its fine grained checklists and succinct, well packaged essays chart a course you can actually follow. Team members will bring this book to project meetings; so should you."
2,If you need to read this You're in the wrong business,"No statement in this book is incorrect, or even inaccurate. The problem with it is it goes on and on about a number of simple, if not trivially obvious facts about how to manage a project. The main one which occupies hundreds of pages is ""PLAN YOUR PROJECT"".So if you could not have thought of these on your own, or ever did anything more complicated than playing tic-tac-toe without discovering this book's type of advice, you have no business managing a software project.However, if you skip all the obvious advice (averaging about 1/70 pages) and enjoy reading phrases like ""Executive Sponsorship"", ""Mushy Milestones"", and ""inch pebbles"" this book is for you. But please buy mine... cheap!"
3,"Good checklists, not enough examples.","This is a good book full of essential checklists for the lifetime of a project. However, it does not contain sufficient examples. For example, there is no sample architecture document, only guidelines. The book's website also does not include examples."
2,I was disappointed by this book,"I expected a lot from that book based on who wrote it. Unfortunately while reading I realized that this book is not up to the standard I expected. All practical parts I would expect to be there are missing - you will find plenty of guidelines though. Also the book throws a lot of numbers at you, but doesn't back them up.Often the book says that you can ""overdo"" something and that's true, but it doesn't say when you're overdoing. I think (and I have nothing to prove that) that many new PMs will try to follow these guidelines ""too much"" (as it often happens with highly theoretical books that should be practical)."
4,Superb project roadmap and cheklists,"Most (but not all) information in ""Software Project Survival Guide"" was also presented in ""Rapid Development"" by the same author.The value of this book is not in the amount of information, because ""Rapid Development"" provides much more information and many different best practices.The value of this book is the clear road map it gives you for running a project according to the ""staged delivery"" model. The checklists in the book are invaluable.This book is a blessing for everyone who is overwhelmed by the amount of information in ""Rapid Development"".I think this book is the perfect companion to ""Rapid Development"". ""Rapid Development"" is the authoritative reference for a lot of good practices. ""Software Project Survival Guide"" provides the checklists and road maps to keep the project on track in every phase of the project."
1,Wrong photo and description,"This is the wrong item. Only in small print is it CORRECTLY described as HDMI-f.The photo shows it as HDMI-m, and the lengthy description explaining its use also has it backwards. Don't trust the photo or the long description.There's no way you could really tell which this is. So I ordered wrong."
1,101 How-To Favorites by Florist's Review,"I'm sorry, but at this time I cannot review this book as I have still not received it as of July 23/05. I ordered this book a little while ago, but it has since passed the date of being received by me and I was only emailed once on June 29/05 by this seller as to the status-they are still trying to obtain this selection for me. I just emailed them again to see if I can get an update on this order or have the seller refund my credit card purchase for this order if it is unobtainable. I don't understand why some sellers list books they are selling and then the buyer never receives their selection. This is the only seller that I've had this long of a wait."
2,THESE ARE MID-1980s RE-RECORDINGS - NOT ORIGINAL VERSIONS,"This is a partial re-issue of Petula's circa 1986 album ""Give It A Try,"" which featured Nashville re-recordings of many of her classic 1960s hits. Of course, the CD here fails to mention on its packaging that these are not the beloved originals. If you want the 1960s versions, buy a Petula CD on the BMG label (or the Hip-O/Universal double CD) in the US or Sanctuary/Castle labels in the UK."
1,Smells CHEAP and ancient,"I was determined to find a classy and sexy citrus. I bought this because of the good reviews on a fragrance website. I'm almost 30 but I wouldn't wish this upon a withered nonagenarian. It smells like a potent CHEAP (think: cheapest you've ever smelled) perfume with massive baby powder throughout. Utterly disgusting. It is unwearable. Upon receipt, I immediately unloaded it on eBay after 1 spray.Don't buy Christian Dior Eau Sauvage either, it smells like someone sprayed Lemon Pledge on a floating turd.I went for a contemporary citrus: L'eau D'Issey Pour Homme. It smells fresh all day long and gets tons of compliments from God's gift to man."
1,return,It was wrong size.I returned and now waiting to return money.Even though I gave my machine number.Next time I should more carefully to order.Both of us waste time and money.
5,A whole new world of birds will open up to you!,"Using memorable examples and mnemonic devices that are actually relevant to any birder in the field, Walton brings birders of all levels a treasure trove of insight in his ""Birding by Ear.""This collection differs from other ""bird song libraries"" in several ways. First, the narrator comments on each species, making sure to point out the ""gotcha"" clues that are evident in every birdsong. And, he speaks to all levels of birders: from the backyard enthusiast to the tried and true birder who has only relied upon eyesight up 'til this point.An unqualified 5 stars! And, its great fun to play this tape nice and loud, with the windows rolled down at a red light! (you'll get some interesting looks.)"
5,Good-sized Oven Mitt,"My husband and I both like oven mitts versus potholders, but since his hands are much larger than mine, we have trouble finding oven mitts that we can both use. These are large enough for him but not bulky so that I can also use them. I got them in the pale yellow, but if we change the colors in our kitchen, I saw that there were other colors available."
5,In My Top Ten,"The sacrificial love in this book takes my breath away! I enjoy Callie and Sin's story every time I read it. I'm reading it to my husband each night. Camraderie, bravery, love and passion make it a fun bedtime story for us both. It is one of my ten favorite novels!"
3,Just ok.,"I thought this book was just ok. I did like the teasing and banter between the two characters, but the problem was that the banter was too contemporary and 20th Century. That really bothered me and threw the book way off for me. There was nothing original about this book; I wish the author hadn't gone with the English/Scottish cliché."
5,Loved it!,"I bought this book yesterday afternoon and spent all evening and into the night reading it. Heartwrenching and heartwarming both. Very refreshing to read a romance novel with all the usual overdramatic elements, but with humor too. I really enjoyed it!"
5,worth 5 happy faces (:D) ...Thats how i feel,"THIS book was soooooooooooooooooooooo good Sin is like the man you just wanna get to know if he really exist There is a part in the book that was SHOCKING, breath taking and just so so times infinity sweet that you rearly will find in Historical romance novels..this book will not dissapoint get the series start with the MASTER OF DESIRE the fisrt book and the BROTHER HOOD OF THE SWORD series you will know the characters moreEverybody has a different opinion when writting a review if we all had the same reviews or opinions it would be boring. Reviews can sometimes down play a really good book or up play a really bad book its up to us to read the book and judge for ourselfs and draw our own conclusion thats the best thing about a review its like a silent debate...."
5,Kinley Macgregore A.K.A. Sherrilyn Kenyon,"Awesome series,but, what do you expect from Sherrilyn Kenyon writing under a different name. LOL She is the best author around no doubt, I have yet to read a book by her under either name that I did not completly love!!! So for those of you that didn't know thats who Kinley MacGregor really was, check out her other books under Sherrilyn Kenyon, you won't be disappointed."
1,Not memorable.,"After writing a handful of 4&5 star reviews I thought it was about time I bothered to write a negative review so I didn't come across as loving every single book I read (it's much easier to write reviews for books you loved rather than hated).This was one book that everyone on the boards seemed to hype up and came highly recommended but unfortunately I can't feel the same. I read this book a couple months ago and as I write this I'm struggling to remember what it was about. Hero and heroine were boring, as was the plot, and well, I suppose even the supporting characters were dull. As I recall, I was barely able to finish it.. there wasn't enough in there to keep me interested, and I just wanted to skim over it quickly so I could start reading another book already.I don't get what the fuss was about. Maybe one day I'll give it another go but if it didn't work the first time, it probably won't again.."
1,Bad! Really Bad!,"So trite! So many tired phases! The hero, so tried, so true, so tortured! So bad! He didn't even have a birthday- nor any Christmas presents! Never loved! NO mother! No love! So many 20th Century phrasings! So old! The usual Scottish vs English during the Plantagenet era. (Could have been the Tudor era!)I bought this book only because it promised a storm for the weekend. Will I ever buy a book from this author again? Noooooo!Even the ""romantic"" scenes were so tired- so trite...need I go on? Sophomoric, really."
3,Not bad,"Pacing was good. Some unusual plot twists. Not a bad read. Male lead was believable, female not so much. Recommended."
3,Attempted Commercial Release,"Sometimes the truth hurts. One reviewer said it all in one sentence: ""All the songs on this CD are strong and could be potential hits on the radio."" If it's an airplay candidate then you can bet it stinks. This release lacks the spirit, grit, and edge of previous releases. Every tune melds into the lame, predictable FM radio genre. The Hendrix subtones are OK but a bit contrived. If you are into ""Hooty & The Blowfish"" only with a decent guitar player then this CD is for you. Listen before you buy."
2,what did you do Mato,I am a true fan of Indigenous. But this album is far away from what Indigenous is. It's not the raw blues we all love them for. It's more a mainstream CD. Better get all their other records instead. These are great blues. Looking foreward to your next album.
2,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"This band is great live,only because of the lead guitar playing of mato. I was expecting some real hard rocking blues. What i got was a few good tracks and lots of radio oriented garbage. Go see them live but don't bother with this cd."
3,Not what I expected from Mato Nanji!,"I have no problem telling you that Mato Nanji is probably the best blues guitar player alive, maybe ever... time will tell. This album, though, is a disappointment. It sounds like Big Head Todd or Hootie and the Blowfish. The vocals are incredibly strong, but Mato's guitar playing is really downplayed in pursuit of what someone must have perceived as ""radio friendly"". That person (Doyle Bramhill?) should really keep his hands off of Mato and the band and let them do what they do best. If this sells well and establishes a direction for Indigenous we will have lost one of the great guitar voices of our time... check out their appearance on Austin City Limits! In summary... this is a misrepresentation of a great band. I'll buy their other discs anyway in the hope that they can capture Indigenous' potential. Mato Nanji... you are one of the greats. Sorry to do this review."
4,ANOTHER GREAT CD FROM IDIGENOUS,"I just received this CD today and have only played it twice. Whenever I've reviewed a CD after such short aquaintence I've gotit wrong. However, this is easier than most.This is not as good as 'THINGS WE DO'. It is mellower and does not show a lot of progress toward a sound of their own. It is still a brilliant CD and shows more facets to these incrediblytalented musos. Again no really weak tracks and great guitar playing ( not as exuberant as the first 2 CD's ) from MATO NANJI,but he still is too close to SRV and HENDRIX in tone and phrasing.As they are the masters there is nothing wrong with this, I just thought with the undoubted talents of MATO NANJI he would develope a style of his own before long.I will just have to keep buying their CD's untill he does and enjoy every moment along the way."
4,Best Native American band to ever come out of North Dakota..,"The best Native American band to ever come out of North Dakota! Produced by Doyle Bramhall. I hear many influences such as Hootie, ZZ Top, Allmans, and Santana but no really strong songs like those bands are known for. Decent album."
5,Best tasting sublingual,Low-dosage sublingual tablets are the best way to take melatonin. The peppermint flavor is a very pleasant way to take them.
5,my must have,"I have 3 little ones with sleep issues, these work the best as recommended by my doc and we give them about an hour before bed and they get sleepy makes bedtime soon much easier my must have for kids with sleep problems."
4,Would have bought this one new.,"This is a very detailed historical account of the Siege of Derry and its place in the struggles of the times. It also provides enough background on the previous events in Ireland that you see the earliest seeds being sewn of ""the Troubles."" I can't completely vouch that it doesn't take sides as I am just not schooled enough in this time period; but, I felt it was balanced.[I had to buy this one used as it seems to be out of print. The transaction went great, and good on Amazon for setting this up.]"
5,Perfect for my 4 and 6 year old,Good selection on stories and great for a new reader. They needed something with a little more meat in it and this bible works.
4,picture bible,"Not what I thought it would be. Large print with short bible stories. Very little scripture. It is good for a beginning level reader. ages 5-7, would get the most out of it. my son needed it for school that is why he needed it. I saved a lot of money by buying it here."
3,Biblical Studies Alternatively Review,"The book was in good physical condition, there was some pen underlinings which weren't appealing but helpful for the project I was doing.Overall I give it three stars, all pages were present and legible."
4,"Great, durable running shoe","I have been wearing this particular shoe now for about 3 years. My current pair is the fifth pair I've owned and have found them to be exactly what I need. They are ideal for runners with mild pronation who need good stability in the heel and mid-foot areas. I do not log as much mileage as in the past, but they continue to suit my current fitness program. I'm a personal trainer (so I'm always on feet working with clients) and also wear them when I workout with weights and when performing other dynamic activities. They've proved to be a versatile, reliable, and affordable shoe and I highly recommend them to anyone with similar needs as my own."
5,Good Looking and Comfortable,"I love these running shoes. They have a great look and they feel great, too. They fit my feet perfectly."
2,not your usual asics,Not the support and comfort I'm used to. I own 2 other pairs of Asics running shoes and should have stuck with them.
4,This is a university professor?,"After watching Project Nim, I was appalled. This alleged ""professor"" - Herbert Terrace - needs to be cattle-prodded into a cage himself. What an arrogant, disingenuous, irresponsible hack..."
3,Not for the Whole Family,"We enjoyed watching this movie, but it was not for the young ones to watch. I found it difficult (violent) in parts. Also, the ""strong language"" did nothing to promote the story line and could have easily been removed. Even during the upbeat parts, you had a pending sense of something bad about to happen. It left me with a lingering sense of sadness."
3,More an exposure of bad scientific technique than a study of the gorilla mind,"This was more an exposure of bad scientific technique than it was a study of the gorilla mind. It was more of the waste of an opportunity to teach a gorilla sign language., This is something that any animal behaviorist would dream about. Instead they're smoking joints with him. I have nothing against marajuana but it has no place in a study such as this. It also had the appearance that the researchers knew nothing of gorilla behavior and what to expect and were simply not equipped to conduct a study like this.It was really sad to see this opportunity squandered by people that attempt to conduct an experiment of this sort when they don't have the necessary background. I'm not saying don't watch this movie but be aware that it is nothing like the study of Koko, it's more an exposure of bad researchers and the wasting of the opportunity to work with a valuable animal"
2,Save your Money!,"I enjoy animal movies that are based on true stories rather than purely fictional tales. NIM is based on a true story; however, I found it lacking a few of the basic ingredients that makes people want to watch movies. There was little action, suspense, or drama, and what very little bit it did have, it was way too predictable. Basically, this flick is more of a documentary than a movie. Half way through it, I found myself looking at the clock, hoping it would soon end. I'm sure the chimp in the research experiment wanted it to end soon, too. I kind of wish I had saved my money on this one, and waited as I think it is now out on the premium movie channels like HBO or Showtime."
1,PETA probably was behind this!,"I stopped watching this 20 minutes in. I was surprised after watching the opening scene of the portrayal of how horribly the chimps were treated. If I wanted to think about this from the standpoint of taking a chimp from it's mother, I am smart enough to realize it. I got this movie, because I really wanted to see how smart the chimps are. Time after time, they continued to just stress all the negatives....Unless you are a member of PETA and want to see this stuff over and over to emphasize your beliefs to yourself, DON'T GET THIS MOVIE."
5,Much needed story to be told,"Excellent documentary offering a rare view into the life of a chimpanzee who was used in scientific language experiment and then simply discarded. The film allows the viewer to question the psychological effect on Nim during his entire ordeal, and opens a great dialogue allowing us to question not only the morality of using these sentient animals in scientific experiments, but also the necessity - or lack thereof.Highly suggested."
2,Shortcoming of the Profiler,"I found this book to be a lot less than I had anticipated. Having read several books by different authors, I had my hopes set too high for this book. Ressler was more concerned about telling the reader how great he has been over his career. He repeatedly throughout the whole book tells us readers how good his talents are and how he was the sole person who developed criminal profiling. The information given was shallow, though the interviews with Dahmer and Gacy were interesting. He provides no depth of knowledge into the criminal mind. I found this book to be an overall disappointment, unless you are a self absorbed person, then Ressler's attitude might be what you looking for. There are several books out which are much better!"
2,Fascinating Material!,"Unfortunately, no one ever told Mr. Ressler that the presentation and analysis (sans the incessant patting himself on the back) of each case would have made his intelligence, experience and expertise self-evident. It is heart-breaking that he felt the need to remind us on every other page how amazing he thinks he is. Speaking only for myself; I'm sure I could have figured that out on my own! I won't buy another of his books and I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,"Yes, Robert, you're good at what you do and we all know it","Despite his braggadocio, the stories he tells are chilling, especially the ones about the South African serial killers (I had never heard of either of them) and information about the Aum Shinrikyo cult that I had not seen elsewhere. Aum Shinrikyo, if you don't remember, was responsible for the Tokyo subway gassing in 1995. Its leader appeared to be a Jim Jones in the making, and that was the least of his danger.John Wayne Gacy was always just plain unlikable, but I always thought Jeffrey Dahmer was sort of a pitiable character and never was this reinforced more than in the chapter about him."
4,great cases - bad egos,"This book explored a lot of different cases and included a lot of material you don't find in other forensic/crime books, such as the interview with Jeffrey Dhamer. However, Robert Ressler has a HUGE ego problem and seemed to spend a lot of time boasting about himself and his work, his overwhelmingly large picture on the front of this book is just a small comparison to whats inside. ;)"
3,the bad and the ugly,"Though I found the material fascinating (especially the chilling interview with Jeffrey Dahmer), I agree with the reviewers who note the egoism. Of course Ressler should be proud, but perhaps he should let others tout his accomplishments rather than doing it himself. It detracts from the cases he describes. It reminds me of the old Saturday Night Live skit when our hero bursts in with, ""Here I come to save the day..."" Despite the egomanical strain, there is lots of good information on behavior profiling here. The author could show a bit more empathy for the victims. He'll recount the most horrid crime as if it were the recipe for apple pie. I'm thankful for his dedication to crime and for his insights into profiles of the serial killer. I suspect his first book is more in depth than this one."
2,"A good beginning, an egocentric ending","I enjoyed the interviews with Dalmer and Gacy as well as the author's expertise in the serial killer arena; however, the book became increasingly tedious and self-involved as the chapters wore on. Frequently, Kessler is self-referential and self-congratulatory, attempting to deny responsibility for SNAFU's that occurred over the course of his career. In addition, he invariably gives himself considerable credit and seems to see himself as a sort of demi-God where this field is concerned. The book seems as much about this author and his perspective as it is about serial killers. At best, his tone is extremely irritating after page 150 or so."
2,"You're going the wrong way, Mr. Ressler . . .","After reading Mr. Ressler' first book, ""Whoever Fights Monsters,"" I was hoping that his second book would go into even greater detail in explaining how the many elements of murder investigation yield a criminal profile of the killer. Sadly, this book goes the other way. It downright skims over some of the most intriguing cases of our time. The result is maddening. I was left hanging time after time after time. I was also hoping that Mr. Ressler would turn down the ego a notch or two with his second book. No such luck. ""I Have Lived in the Monster"" is even more ego-ridden than ""Whoever Fights Monsters."" If you don't believe me, just check out the photo section. I am still looking for that special book that goes into great depth on just one case to show true-crime buffs just how criminal profiling really works. That was a HINT, Mr. Ressler!"
2,"Ego, ego, ego....","Mr. Ressler seems to find ways to work himself (and his accomplishments) into each story he tells. Very disappointing book! Really didn't care for the comment made about John Douglas either! Mr. Ressler, I wanted to read a book about what stirs these people to commit the crimes they do - not about you and your accomplishments. Save it for your bio - and let someone else read it!"
2,More about the mind of Ressler than those of serial killers,"This book and ""Whoever Fights Monsters"" are more about the mind of Robert K. Ressler than about the minds of serial killers. The books present an interesting history of the profiling of serial killers Ressler leaves no doubt that he coined the term ""serial killer"" but these are not books dealing with the psychiatry of serial killers."
2,Egomania,"While the subject matter is inherently fascinating, Ressler manages to turn it into a 200-page excuse to brag about his accomplishes. Yes, his achievements are remarkable, but his incessant boasting (as another reader commented, he finds a way to work himself into every story) grows tiresome very quickly. True, he has handled some fascinating cases, but I bought the book to learn about criminal profiling, not about Ressler's self-proclaimed genius."
3,Stick with TV,"Could this book be more self serving? This guy is really impressed with himself, it really takes away from the stories. I'm a big buff of A&E American Justice, the History Channel and CourtTV. I'd rather watch that and hear the same stories, or at least types of stories, told objectively. Instead of reading about what a wonderful guy the author is."
2,Ressler sounds angry at the FBI,"I have enjoyed reading true crime for some time now including Whoever Fights Monsters, But this book is self serving and does not introduce any new information you have not already read. It seems Mr. Ressler is angry at John Douglas and others for not aknowledging his effort while an active profiler and he is trying to show them he was first or best or something. The message was lost on me. The interviews are something to read however the bulk of the book is simply a retread of his previous works. My advice. Skip it."
2,Doesn't live up to hype,"Unfortunately for the reader who spent good money on this book, it does not live up to its hype. First, Ressler has a monstrous ego; an example: he didn't coin the term serial killer any more than the three other authors claim to; it's been around since the 50's. His book is biased and slanted, while masquerading as a facts-only book. He claims to have had a greater play in many cases, most notably the Chase case, than he actually did. While the book was entertaining, it was not worth the money. Borrow it from the library or a friend."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY-AT ANY PRICE!,"ROBERT RESSLER NEEDS TO GET OVER BEING IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF. WHILE HE MAY HAVE SOME INSIGHT ON THE SUBJECT OF SERIAL KILLERS, HE SPENDS MORE TIME INFLATING HIS OWN EGO THAN HE DOES ON THE SUBJECT. A MORE APPROPRIATE TITLE MIGHT BE, ""I LET SERIAL KILLERS TALK TO ME"". THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME."
4,"Once again, Ressler hits it on the head!!","Ressler continues to dig deeper and probe more thoroughly the sick twisted minds of serial killers and their ilk. His methods of profiling and his work with the Behavioral Science Unit along with his cooperative efforts with the likes of John Douglas,John Walsh,etc...leave you turning the pages in anticipation of ""how'd they catch him??"" A constant source of late night reading and a beach book as well....Ressler gives civilians the feeling that maybe someone is on our side and is watching over us! Someone so gifted and such a hard worker...yet so humble and precise in his writings!!! Ressler's a GENIUS!!"
1,falsifier's work,"One reads in this book that Jean-Pierre Voyer is now on the extreme-right. Well, he's not... So I guess Bracken is a cretin. (And no mention is made of Voyer's criticisms of the S.I....)"
1,if only i could give it zero stars,"it sucked it wasnt funny and the quality sucked just all around bad, booooooo never make another movie please!!!!!i could have threw my money in the toilet flushed it and had more enjoyment then watching this crap"
5,Honor to Zap Mama for the love of LOVE,"A must-have CD for the lovers of African + Roots + R&B = REAL Good Music by Marie Daulne, taking us ""From Progres to Progress""!"
4,Music,"Zap Mama not only provides one with music to move the soul, her lyrics are strong and speaks Truth in volumes"
3,Where is AmaZing vocals??,I really like Zap MaMA but this is not my favorite album of her's.She can do super-human things with her voice but I wasnt hearing that on this one.Dont get me wrong;just about anything she puts out I'd love but I really prefer Am a Zone to this.She might've had fun with all the guests on this but it just did not move me.
2,great gum,"The gum was shipped promptly, but it was 3 pounds short.I took it to work to weigh it and it was only 22 pounds. very disappointing."
3,"good product, poor packaging","I also have a small vending machine business, so I need to order this product for that. I can't complain about the quality of the gum, but it comes with the worst packaging they can do. In my last shipment the bag that contain the gum was all ripped and the gum all over the box. I think that the company that sells this product can put a little more on the bag. It used to be a sealed weather proof silver one and now the one that you get at any supermarket for your veggies and fruits it's a lot better that the one holding the gum. I got pictures of my last shipment as a proof. Please do something! We are all in the same business! We will not be able to sell this product any more if they keep ""saving"" on cheap stuff!"
3,Altoids Gum Shipping Box,"This product needs to be shipped in a heavier box and especially a heavier and weather proof bag for the gum. The current box comes crushed and the bag holding the gum is so thin it can't hold the product without tearing. Plus, on all three boxes I have ordered so far, the bag ends up sticking to the tape on the outside of the box because the box is too lightweight for the 25 lbs. of gum. If it is too hot the gum will be ruined and if it is too cold the gum will freeze and crack. This product was previously shipped in a weather proof bag. If this box is dropped there is a chance there will be 25 pounds of gum all over the ground."
2,"It's an ok masterlink, but it's not the one pictured.","I ordered this product because i thought it was the kind of link that you just pull together, not the standard type.Still the product is either not the one pictured or i was sent the wrong part. I dont have time to mess around shipping it back though.It's ok quality, not good, just OK, but it will work for my purpose.this link doesnt even look to be KMC(Or any) brand, as it is completely logo-less.Well at least is got here super quickly."
4,Share the love,"Let there be love gets 5 stars from me, it is great song sung by both Liam and Noel in the style of the Beatles. However the B sides don't live up to Oasis' reputation for putting out great tracks on there singles as well as albums.Don't get me wrong, Track 2 ""Sittin' here in silence (on my own) is still a good song, but sadly only runs for about 2 minutes and so much more could have been done with it. Written by Noel, it is very much a Lennon-esque song that deserves to be a B side onlyTrack 3, a live version of Rock N' Roll Star has been done before, and is no better or worse than other versions getting around.The B sides get 3 stars each from me. Buy it only if you are a hardcore Oasis fan."
2,Not among their best....,"What can I say? I would have never chosen this track as a single for this album.Traditionally, singles are picked for radioplay and marketability.""Let There Be Love"" is not one of those songs. It's a weak track. Noel should have just left this up to Liam to sing the whole song.Reccomended for serious Oasis fans only."
4,LIKE NO OTHER SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD,"IN THIS VIDEO, MS. BROWN POURS HER HEART OUT IN WHAT SHE WANTS IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP. VERY EROTIC AND EXOTIC."
3,Not perfect for a partial remodel,"I bought this book because I am remodeling my basement. I find about 1/3 of the book to be useful, maybe a bit more.There is a lot in here about purchasing a home for the purpose of remodeling, and those who would make such a purchase appear to be the target audience. For me, much of that content is not necessary because I am remodeling part of a home that I already own. There is also unneeded content about financing and making a real estate purchase. All this in a book that is only 106 pages plus appendices (contracts, forms, and sample blueprints)."
1,misled by previous reviews,"Donna Ingersoll's book depicts the hardworking and respectful life of the Cheyenne people. Her hero's tribe, including his own wife treat the white woman he finds with kindness and generosity. My disappointment with the book comes from the boring dialoge and lack of descriptive writing. I do not enjoy a story of a hero who covets another woman while his pregnant wife is trying her best to be generous and considerate of his ""guest. Sorry, I did not like the book at all."
4,I'll never pick up my knitting needles again without remembering this movie,"This movie was a surprise from start to finish. It definitely kept me off balance and was unpredictable, if not pretty disturbing. I will never pick up my knitting needles again without thinking of this movie. Strange how familiar objects and sounds take on an entirely different meaning in this boy's world."
3,good for some things,"sturdy. good for hiking, not so much for snowshoeing (the plastic sizing piece contracts in the cold and doesn't fit as it should). make sure you size them to your body and get the hand straps on correctly, it makes all the difference."
1,BROKEN CLASP,"Hello, I would like to say that I thought these would be simple, classy earrings for work. I just received the item today. They look so cheap!! I can't even believe it! The clasp was defective and the gem completely fell out! I just received them two minutes ago. I am in the process of getting a refund. I can say that the booklet that comes with the earrings is very convenient if you are unsatisfied...However, I would appreciate an accurate life-size photo, so I don't waste my time in the future. I think I'll just stick to books from Amazon."
3,Nice Earrings - Post too short,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. These are nice earrngs, however I have to struggle to get them in place. The post just needs to be about 1/16"" longer."
5,Percy's most commercial and still brilliant . . .,"The Second Coming sold surprisingly well, probably because it features a quirky love story and has one of the most original openings I've ever encountered. The young heroine has just completed a course of electroshock therapy. Although the procedure leaves her amnesic, she is able to learn what she needs to know by consulting a letter she wrote to herself prior to the last session.Based on that tantalizing start, you might expect a quick moving plot and a tale of conspiracy. No dice. This is Walker Percy. What you're going to get is an exploration of the human psyche and how we manage to get lost from ourselves. It's not a roller coaster ride, but that's not why we read Walker Percy. His readers sail into uncharted oceans."
2,Loose Ends,"This is a very scattered novel with lots of needless repetitions. What was Percy on when he wrote this thing? There are so many loose ends it would take an additional book just to tie them all together. My response to this book is similar to the incessant grunts of the protagonist Will Barrett--""Huh""?, ""What""?, ""Who""? ""Eh""? For me a poor ending and an unsatisfying read. Perhaps I should go back and read it again to see what all these five stars are about."
2,Meandering stretch of a story,"This is the first Walker Percy book I have read. I don't believe I'll choose another unless there's compelling reason. Mr. Percy started off well with a good writing style; a little more than half-way through, I realized he was padding the book with irrelevant, fantastic vignettes. This is one of the few books I threw away rather than pass on to a friend."
1,Don't waste your money.,How many times does he fall down before you give up on the monotony of this book? Save your money.
4,Excellent social history of Coney Island,"Despite all the books about Coney Island, there really aren't that many of substance. John Kasson here gives a serious yet extremely entertaining look at the social forces in play at Coney Island 100 years ago. This is as much about the birth of mass culture as it is about the rides and the personalities who built Coney Island."
2,This book doesn't cover the topics very well.,I actually took the ACRC class from Mike Shroyer and then read this book five months later. After failing the exam I read the coursebook and passed. This book does cover a lot of information but it's not presented the way the Cisco presents it on the test. I'd recommend a Cisco Press book over this one.
1,Do not waste your time.,Does not cover all the material from ACRC exam. To many errors. Very brief. Do not recommend. Only waste of your time reading this book. Failed the exam. Go get Sybex book -- very good. I passed an exam in first attemt.
1,Waste of Money,"This book is flat-out terrible. Incomplete coverage, questions that don't compare with the complexity of the real test, no useful examples, mistakes galore. I have used it only as a supplement (and a marginally useful one at that). Some Exam Cram books are superb; this one is not."
2,Missed the mark,I used this book among others. The book does not contain the necessary depth and breadth to pass the ACRC test.
5,Mew's Theme is adorable!,"I brought this cd because I love Pokemon the first movie and I think it has some wonderful music. My favorite track is by far Mew's Theme, even if it is only 30 seconds long. Mew is my favorite Pokemon and the song is very cute. If your a fan of the first Pokemon movie, this cd is a must."
5,Fianally!,"Fianally they have made a CD of the actual score from the movie instead of that ""inspired by..."" stuff. Excellent!"
5,Love at first hearing,"A very nice music experience. I especially like ""Tears of Life"". The music helps putting you in a good mood. I'm disapinted that it didn't recieve as much praise as the album. I adore Mewtwo and I can't wait for ""Mewtwo Returns"". I hope the music is as good as this one. All the tracks are good but my favorites are ""Tears of Life"" and ""Surviving the Storm"". My praise of the composers of this album."
3,Prepositions Matter,"Prepositions matter.I was looking for a Battlefield show from the first series on the Battle OF Normandy.This show is from the second series of Battlefield and is called the Battle FOR Normandy. If you actually look at the show, it's got the sub-title, ""The Battle for Caen"".Never quite understood the issues and problems the British faced in their push for Caen on the eastern side of the Normandy beachhead. This covers Monty's challenges quite well However, if you're looking for things in the American sector, this DVD doesn't cover it.Also, this DVD does not seem to work in older DVD players but works fine on my late model Macintosh computer."
5,Political intrigue among the stars!,"Guest star James Sloyan is riveting as the ""defector"" in the episode's title. Almost like a companion piece to ""Deep Space Nine's 'Duet'"", the show is an exercise in the politics and machinations of war.Like the best ""Treks,"" this one mixes science fiction with biting social commentary. This third season offering was one of the best."
5,Absolutely the best Romulan episode of the series!,"The Enterprise intercepts a fleeing Romulan scout ship crossing the neutral zone with a war-bird right on it's tail! After warning off the war-bird, the passenger of the scout ship beams aboard the Enterprise with news of a Romulan invasion! But this Romulan is not what he seems nor is the information he brings to the Enterprise. This episode ends with possibly the best Enterprise/Warbird encounter of the entire series and the death of a man who only wished to secure the future for his family. A personal top ten episode!"
2,BobJava LeanCaffe,"I made this several times and had several other people taste it and we all agreed that there is something that just didn't taste right. We thought it was probably the cinnamon, since most can at least tolerate a hazelnut flavor. As far as curbing appetite, I felt that it worked, but just couldn't get past the flavor. I probably won't buy this again, too costly anyway."
3,Too slow...,"China Zorrilla is great, as always. However, the movie is slow, at times boring and a littledepressing. Would not see it again."
3,testing the waters,"Dear gentlemen,This was my first time hearing James Harman. The cut that I fell in love with was ""The Falcon's Nest"". I am really a jazz lover and that cut just blew me away.The blues are okay but I was looking more for the instrumentals that I thought the CDs would contain. I will be purchasing more CD's now that I know how because KPLUplay some beautiful music.Bro. Alexander Coleman"
3,Tracks don't match the description.,"The tracks you have linked here do not appear to be by the James Harman Band's ""Mo'Na'Kins, Please"" CD.I'm just hazarding a guess, but the tracks I heard from these links sure sound like New Yorker rocker Patti Smith to me."
4,A fine portrait of the artist as a young man,"Darcey O'Brien's fine Bildungsroman is a very funny and lethal depiction of a golden Hollywood childhood which begins to tarnish as his parents' careers do. The narrator's parents--a histrionic former screen beauty obsessed with sex and a former Western star of amiable disposition but sometimes hidden motives--unconsciously (and even sometimes consciously) wreak all kinds of havoic in their son's life, but as he gets older the son begins to fight back in covert ways. This was exactly the kind of book that the NYRB series was created to revive: a funny and poignant novel of sterling quality that somehow slipped through the cracks of readers' attention years ago and deserves a new chance."
5,Best book on this era of film history,"A wonderfully complete entry in the ten volume series, History of American Cinema, created and edited by Charles H. Harpole. Great unique illustrations and award winning prose."
5,Fascinating,A terrifically informative look at silent films in the era right before the emergence of talkies.
3,Unseen Cinema,"Unseen Cinema is a Collection Like no other. If you appreciate the old school, this is it."
2,Sprout Master,"The biggest disadvantage to the sprout master is that i found it difficult to get rid of the hulls - it seems to be much easier with a jar and screens. However, the sprouts seem to store well in the sprout master - they stay fresh a long time."
2,ms.,"Certainly not worth the price. It's only advantage to using jars is it stacks. Good luck getting a response from the company if you need any information (which is seriously lacking with your purchase). Save your money, use jars."
2,overpriced,"Product is ok, but I consider it very expensive for a small plastic item! If I had seen the product in person, I never would have paid that much for it."
1,Umm why wont the water stay in!,I read all the reviews before purchasing. Just received the mini sprouter tried to start using but the water keeps leaking out the sides. Not sure what i could be doing wrong since its only 7 pieces that stack. Very disappointing! Returning this ASAP!!
4,Thought-provoking read,"I have always wanted to read AOS and this was his first material I've read. It was very very interesting. I found myself highlighting excerpts on every page. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a different perspective on humanity, life. There were a few typographical errors on this Kindle version, which were slightly distracting and irksome.. Hopefully someone can fix that someday. Either way, I'm definitely going to read it again, and keep it forever!"
2,Not that good,Barbara McGrath has done lots of books like this--simple counting books using candy or some kind of food. This is OK but the illustrations aren't that good.
5,EYE OPENER.,"""Day of Deception"" is brilliant. The book is an open exposee of the issues that need to be addressed in the USA. The root cause being deception. The book applies to everyone; a self-examination will tell us if we are deceived or not. There are solutions proposed, some of which I could live out. The book is for those who will take action; definitely not for faint-hearted reader. I thank God for his man of integrety and boldness whom he uses to expose a nation's deception. This book encourages and invigorates the reader to pay attention to the times and act within the limits of God's will. Fortunately, the exposure of deception in the USA emanates from love; the reading will not depress you, but tickle you..."
2,Patriotism diguised as Christianity,"I don't deny that John C. Hagee is a Christian. However, in this book he seems to be focusing on the American flag more than the cross of Jesus as the symbol of his religion. He bases his ideas on all the patriotic rhetoric we've heard before -- dollar bills say ""In God We Trust"", the pledge of allegiance says we're ""One Nation Under God"", so therefore America MUST be a Christian nation, and any idea that goes against its foundations is therefore anti-Christian as well. I've never believed it, and for any other Christian who doesn't buy into the patriotic style of religion, I would recommend reading Who Speaks For God? by James Wallis. It talks about similar issues from a much more balanced point of view."
3,"It's not a 12 oz. glass, it's a 10 oz. glass","I ordered these particular glasses because I was looking to replace some 12 oz. water/wine glasses, and the price seemed right. Upon opening the box, the glasses seemed rather small.I took out myPyrex Prepware 1-Cup Measuring Cup, Clear with Red Measurements, and put 8 oz. of water into it, and then filled the glass. The glass had a bit more room so I added 2 more ounces and that topped it off. So, this is only a 10 oz. glass.Does that make a difference? It does for me. I like a bigger glass, and wanted at least a 12-16 oz. glass.Amazon should change these to indicate they're 10 oz. glasses, not 12 oz. glasses.The quality of the glass was also in question. The base was off center on each of the glasses, and the glass itself is rather fragile. I don't expect they can be knocked around too much before they break."
4,Pink Faustina glasses,"The glasses arrived quickly. They are a bit more fragile than I thought when purchasing them, but they are quite lovely. The itching of the flowers add a bit of elegance. For the price, they were worth it as I will only use them when I have guests over........and not everyday. I would recommend either hand washing them or make sure no other dish is placed near them in the dishwasher to insure that they are not broken.I really love the pale pink color, too."
2,"great product, poor service and incomplete shipment","I love the glasses. They are beautiful. But I was very dissapointed by the fact that I ordered two sets, and only received one set, although the packing slip stated that my order was complete. After calling to report the problem, I was told I would receive the second complete set that I had ordered. Shortly after that, I received an email stating that the item was out of stock and could no longer be ordered. So I had to call again to request a refund since my credit card had been charged for a shipment of two sets, which I never received. In the end, I am one set short and have had to make too many phone calls. I'm still waiting to see if I receive the refund on this month's credit card statement."
5,Works for what I needed it to.,"I use the light to brighten up my shop. I don't know much about lighting, so I can't tell you specifics on color range, but it works for my basic lighting needs, and that is good enough for me."
2,WTF?,"I haven't used this product yet, but I'm sure it's the real thing. The thing that I don't like about this transaction is that it didn't arrive as presented on the Amazon web site. It was displayed in a plastic container. It arrived in a metal container that will be more difficult to effectively reseal after each use. Either change the picture or change the container!"
5,An Excellent Product!,"We have used Hope's Tung Oil for several years now, and it's our oil of choice for finishing furniture, touching up our oil and wax floors, and weatherproofing outdoor teak furniture and wooden gates. A very good product at a very good price, especially with free shipping."
5,Excellent book,This is a most excellent book in all respects. It preserves the integrity of the Bible and of the Lord bringing into discussion Old Testament ethical life and its applicability to us today. I especially enjoyed its discussions on marriage and its banishments of hyperliteralism.
5,Belkin Leather Case that I didn't have to pay $19.99 retail for!!!,I was so excited to find this case on line for my 4th Gen iPod Nano! I have had the same case for it's Daddy (5th Gen Video iPod Classic) for a couple of years and the quality is amazing. My favorite part is that I didn't have to pay $19.99 retail for it. Exceptional quality and very stylish. I purchased two within a weeks time because I was so pleased with the quality and price.Jeff Boone
1,Not good.,Not a high quality case. No access to the IPOD dock. I sent it back and got a different case.
1,brook benton/s greatest hits,This cd has Mr.Benton/s greatest hits. That is the only positive thing that can be said about it. The sound quality is horrible. It is not even recorded in stereo. This is a very poor quality black markrt recording.
1,Brook Benton's Greatest Hits,These are not the original recordings! They are fair if you don't mind remakes but I am one of those fanatics who likes to hear it the way I remember it and these aren't even close.
2,Doesn't live up to expectations...,"This is a fine book if you want to teach mischief and disobedience. I really liked the first book we got from this author and illustrator If Animals Kissed Goodnight, so I went searching for another book. The illustrations are nice, very calming and soft, great for bedtime. But, the story is about a monkey who creates great havoc and gets snarled at by various circus folk. We still use it occasionally for our 18 month old, but I change the words which will work until he starts to read or recognize the displeased expressions on the characters' faces."
2,I thought I was ordering a HO scale model,"I was looking for an HO scale of the tanker ""Gramps"", I guess I need to read the adds better. it's not a bad model,Its just not what I wanted. I guess I need to read between the lines"
3,New Thoughts on the New South,"Despite Middleton's English eccentricities at times coming out, this makes for a great read. His idea to travel across the Deep South using not only a rental car but also all other forms from Greyhhound bus to Amtrak train allows him to meet a good cross section of people to gain insight into the region. It's also the first travel book I've read that fully explains how BBQ differs region to region in the South and how grits has such a hold on Southerners. His take on Southerners' obsession with heroes of the Lost Cause (i.e., the Civil War) really hits home and shines a lot of light on the recent Confederate flag debate in South Carolina. Highly recommended and check out his other stuff especially ""Last Disco in Outer Mongolia."""
3,My least favorite,"Out of Pale Forest's entire current discography this disc probably disappointed me the most. Being their first full release it contains plenty of catchy tunes, some great melodies and one or two outstanding tracks, but as a whole the album is rather undeveloped and carries little concrete continuity throughout its whole. It is easy to see on their next album how they matured musically. If you are new to Pale Forest check out either ""Of Machines and Men"" and ""Exit Mould"", and if you like those then get this."
4,Thorough discussion on religion,"GURPS Religion provides a thorough (almost too thorough!) framework for roleplayers to create religions for their campaigns. Although it is very complete, it needs to have more direction for the novice campaign creator. I felt lost trying to determine the best place to start. I still recommend it for game masters creating campaigns."
1,Not worth it,I thought this turner would be a good investment because of the Calphalon brand. Not impressed. Almost immediately it started almost chipping at the tip. Then I went to cook a grilled cheese and it melted to the pan! Not worth it.
1,Melts too easily,"Apparently the 400 degree max is not enough for my needs. I made pancakes, which cook at reasonably low heat, and the nylon came off the turner. Gross!!I would NOT recommend this product."
1,Poorly Made - Can't Handle the Heat,"Purchased this turner 30 days ago. Reason for purchasing was the Calphalon name. Unfortunately, it does not hold up as advertised. Using the turner on a T-Fal non-stick pan on a GE electric stove where we never turn the heating dial past the number five (5), the end and side of the turner is disintegrating and fraying. Clearly, this is not ""heat-safe silicone"" as advertised. Nor is it ""heat resistant to 400 degrees"" as adveristed. Frankly, I don't think there is any silicone in it. It appears to be a cheap, low-end plastic flipper."
5,You must listen!,"B'z is the best rocker in not only Japan but also the planet. If you can't understand Japanese lyric, you'll feel the spirit and heart. You'll change your thought of Japanese rocks."
5,"Scholarly, complete","Robert Gordis has written a complete, if not definitive, commentary on the Book of Ecclesiastes. He was Professor of the Bible at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America for eight years and an adjunct professor of religion at Columbia University. He gives Ecclesiastes a thorough literary, philosophical, and stylistic analysis against the background of both Hebrew and Near Eastern Wisdom literature in relation to Greek and Egyptian wisdom."
4,Bluegrass collection -- old and new,"This collection of bluegrass standbys is complimented with a second CD of more modern music. The ""Now"" CD includes many hits that were not originally recorded as bluegrass, but the renditions are a must for all lovers of wonderful bluegrass instrumentals.The ""Then"" disc is certainly a favorite for lovers of traditional bluegrass music. Many old favorites -- and many great artists."
2,Incredibly mixed bag,"While there was some excitement about this series, things just didn't go right for most of these. The Ben Dunn penned and illustrated ""bookend"" stories are lacking in any real imagination in the manga-fication of the Marvel Universe. Plus, the introduction of the ideas is handled in such a rushed fashion that you never get to stop and like a character or absorb the concepts.Some of the individual things worked alright. Lea Hernandez and Peter David score with a fun, kabuki-sytle Punisher. Kaare Andrews' take on Spider-Man is... okay, really. Udon does nifty art for Avengers Assemble, but the story isn't up to much. Same with most of the others.Frankly, there are great Manga and superhero books out there. May I point you to the work of Miyazaki or Mark Millar's Ultimates for entertaining Manga or pure superhero reimagining? This book, overall, is decidedly average."
4,Corelle 10-ounce bowls,"I needed more 10-ounce bowls for eating food (lentils, ice cream, etc)These work great in microwave, wash up well in dishwasherGood quality and nice easy clean upA little plain looking but there are other sets on Amazon with flower patternsHighly recommended"
5,Perfect Cat Food Bowl,"This bowl is perfect for feeding a cat wet food. Since it's becoming more widely known that dry food isn't good for cats (their bodies aren't designed for dry food) more people are switching to a high quality canned or raw diet. These bowls are just the right size, clean easily & are hard to break. I've had them for over 20 years & never broken one!"
2,Overpriced,"These are great bowls, but they are being sold by Amazon for four times the usual price (e.g. you can buy them for $2.99 each on Corelle's own website).Most of Amazon's other Corelle prices are about the same or in some cases less than Corelle's own, so it wouldn't surprise me if this pricing was just some sort of error. In any case though, don't get swindled."
3,Quartz clock ideas,"Silly me, I thought this book might be a how to on building clock works. Instead I got a very nice book with beautiful pictures of common refuse with a hole poked in it and a battery operated quartz clock movement bolted in. If you lack creativity, this book is a good source of ideas but, if your looking for a more horologically centered book, you can pass on this one."
5,Albita's Best,"In a few words, this is the best CD Albita has recorded. She has managed to pack plenty of punch while retaining the traditional style of Cuba's soneros. Probably the most authentic of her recordings, it takes me back to my Cuban roots. I have a large collection of Cuban music and this one is one of the best."
5,una chica caliente~,"una chica caliente... if my spelling is correct that will mean ""one hot chick!""i saw albita quite by accident @ the blue note in nyc. the first thing i saw her do was put a hurtin' on Oye Como Va ~move over carlos santana!actually, those two would be a great combo.anywho the concert was great & i went right out and bought this cd.expand your horizons...get out & see the world a little...albita is fantastic!"
3,Not her best...,"As with this cd, I noticied that there was a lack in that up beat variation of music. Altough this cd is not bad, it will not remain as one of my favorites of Albita. Maybe it was harder with her new company. I am goign to see Albita, front row seats this June in Vienna, Virginia. I know she will be outstanding... I guess I was just expecting a little more out of this cd..."
2,Lacking in content,"If English is your language, then this book has 2/3 of useless text for you as it includes other languages. The text in this book is surprisingly lean, take out the other languages and you would have a very thin book indeed. Further, the texts are quite a dull read, except for the interview (which is the most interesting part of this book aside from the photographs), the text reads like someones college report.The image reproductions are well done, but be aware that there are not a lot of them...."
2,He Forgot The Interesting Stuff,"Disappointed almost to the point of disgust, to put it in as straightforward a way as possible. How can someone that has been involved in so much history give us a memoir with so little to say. He has seen so much, interviewed so many important and influential people during the last 40 years surly he has better stories then this. The book started out with the obligatory small town boy stories with the average level of interest, unfortunately the book really never got past this dull, inconsequential stuff. He gave as much time to getting stuck with a dinner bill by the Kennedy's as he did the assassination of JFK. You decide which is more important. Overall I felt the book was a major let down."
2,Not very secure,"I ordered this product through another site when I was redoing some of the fencing on my property and changing from a wood plank fence to the electric tape. I was planning to use the existing wooden posts to secure the tape so I ordered these insulators. To date, I have been very unsatisfied with them. They come unclasped very easily and I often go to the barn in the morning to find entire sides of my paddock with the fence on the ground because a horse bumped it and they came undone. I have stood there and watched as the wind caused 3-4 of these insulators to come undone just from the pressure of the wind on the tape.I suppose if I lived in a place with no wind and didn't have horses that would test the fence occasionally, I would probably like them...but I will not be buying these again. Matter of fact, I will soon be re-doing the fence again and I will be finding different insulators that will work better."
3,Takes ages!,"its good at a certain level - but very laborious in detail. You'd have to be punctilious to want this much detail about Mayan or Egyptian mathematics, calendars etc! Not for me as a 'get to the point' kinda guy. LOL"
5,Read The Book,"I will not repeat the analysis given by others. I just wanted to say anyone interested in this disc should also buy a book of Blake's poetry with The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell; it's much easier to read than the lyrics printed in the CD booklet, and you'll get more poetical gems by this great poet."
5,A Strange Trip,"To really understand this release, you must forget that the Bible is not the word of God. William Blake, like most other poets, were able to see past the Christian/Catholic assault on what was supposed to be an allegory of creation. ""Western"" man is unable to comprehend the fact that the Bible was SUPPOSED to be Myth. Poets understood this, as they dealt with it all the time. That's all I'll say on that. Read some Gnostic gospels and you'll see...The music is brilliant. Mixing metal, acoustic passages, techno with spoken word and singing. Some people we upset about the ""spoken word"" parts. I think it really lends to the mood. Basically it is the entire poem ""The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"" used as lyics and Ulver put music to it. And as usual they went over most people's heads. Don't think of this as an album...think of it as an expierence (sorta like Pain of Salvation's ""BE""). Do this, and a whole world opens up to the senses.Amazing stuff."
3,Sox review,"Nice fit and comfortable.easy to clean.bought via gift card and they fir the need!however, these very nice liner socks, which are used mostly for hiking, are readily available at my local sports store."
2,Going downhill,"I used this book as a student and enjoyed it then. Years later, as a professor, I decided to switch from Krebs and Davies' text to this one for the greater number of examples. However, the lack of theoretical underpinning makes this book more of a fun read than an educational one. My students often thought ""wow, thats cool"" without understanding the significance. I also found the avoidance of mathematical models troubling. This is a trend I have seen in the most recent Ricklefs' Ecology text as well (which I no longer use). Beautiful photos, easy to read, lots of examples, but much too watered down. I would give this book to my parents to read to understand animal behavior, but I wont use it for a college text again."
4,Book of examples and studies; great for animal behavior,"While I expected this book (and my course) to be a book of concepts and theories, they are actually filled with examples of field studies, lab studies, etc. This makes the book actually enjoyable to read, if you have any interest in animal behavior. The writer is an evolutionary biologist himself, and he makes this clear when he explicitly compares his opinions to other biologists' opinions. The images of the author's thumb as a mating object by a bee were also amusing. Like another reviewer mentioned, this book is fun, and can -almost- be read for fun."
2,Poorly organized,"Very poorly organized. Focuses on case studies (like pages and pages about vole hormones and a whole chapter on bird song) rather than concepts. The writing style is decent, but it's not very comprehensive or clear, and the author makes some mistakes (he misinterprets a critical graph when discussing hyena hormones and ends up with a bad conclusion. My teacher knows he screwed it up because she wrote the paper he cites incorrectly).The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is that my teacher says that, while it is quite bad, there are no better alternatives."
2,Lack of Mammalian Studies,"I was disappointed by the lack of mammalian studies in this book. I was overloaded with avian studies, which are interesting to a point, but the book is permeated with them. On the whole, I would not reccomend this book to those who enjoy animals such as whales, tigers, other mammals."
2,Not that well written,"First of all, this isnt a textbook in the traditional sense, so dont get fooled.It is actually just a compilation of research done on animal behavior, plus a few bolded words and definition.Definitely a really dry read that makes it overly complicated to understand a concept.For example, i dont need to know about the experimental design of ducks and how they got them to imprint, i just need a definition and a quick example, not a 3 page long spiel that is a waste of my time to read"
2,Ok for starters...,"when I first got into MMA, a buddy gave these to me. I thought they looked pretty cool, and they did the job. After about year of using them (and as my kicks got stronger and technique improved) the just didn't cut it anymore. Any one who is interested in getting serious with MMA should not get these, due to the fact that you eventually out grow them and require a higher quality product."
2,Not Impressed,"I am usually pleased with Everlast quality, but it was not the case with these. The stitching between the shin pad and instep pad started coming loose fairly quickly. They still have not separated, but they are well on their way. The band on the bottom of the instep guard is almost completely off on one side. They get a solid amount of use, but they had disappointed on the amount of wear. The amount of padding is good and pads themselves work well, but they are falling apart at the connections. Put your money into something else."
4,Shin Guards,"Good product. works as advertised, have not tired all brands hence only 4 stars but I an still walk after a hard work out :)"
3,Love Evergreen - Ginny Aiken,"Quite entertaining... the romance is a bit too thick and perhaps even too much like a fairy tale at times. The two characters are charming, and their story was quite enjoyable for a light read. Though extremely unrealistic, the author provided an entertaining tale of a wealthy woman and an Indian. Though I did find the heroine too dependent, and wished she stood up for herself more."
4,Old fashioned spy book,"Alan Judd brought us back to the golden era of the Cold War spy novels. There are no explosions and flashy superheros. Spy business is a dreary, cerebral game. Secret services spy on enemies, on friends and on those who are hard to pin down. Charles Thoroughgood, young, idealistic spy beginner is a richly written character. Complex miasma of his new business soon overwhelms him, but he shows a surprising talent for the game. I am hoping for much more from Mr. Judd. It was a very rewarding experience."
1,What about IP?,"I will confess -- I've only spent a few minutes with this book in a boosktore. I didn't buy it. Here's a big reason why: the index lacked entries not only for ""patents"" but for ""intellectual property"".For lots of companies in my part of the world (Silicon Valley) patents and other intangible rights in technology are the most important kind of intangible asset. You also can't do patent strategy without having some understanding of the constraints (and opportunities) created by patent law. If the book omits those topics, then I don't see how it can do a complete job.OTOH, if you like lots of consultant-type diagrams with platitudes about ""customer value"", ""long-term value"" ""meeting customer needs"" and the like, all garnished with arrows going all over heck, you might feel very comfortable with this book."
5,Got to me in good time. As it is a text book I haven't opened it yet.,like I said it got to me in good time but as it is a text book I haven't opened it yet.
2,Balancing the Strategy,"This book has serious inadequacies in its presentation of strategy maps. It is difficult to read and furthermore it offers unbalanced maps which are not significant to business bottom-line.However, the last two chapters of the book are somewhat useful and can help a novice in understanding what strategy maps are and how one could in concept employ in business"
4,A Little Inconsistent but Works Fine,"It takes a little practice to get a good transfer to paper. ""Sent"" stamps seem to be a little less common than others - this one is a good choice."
4,Star Trek VI,"This is one of the best entries in the Star Trek film series. I hold it alongside STII: Wrath of Khan as one of my favorites.It's very well executed, well written, with plenty of action and excitement, and none of the shortcomings of the preceeding film (""The Final Frontier"").I especially enjoyed seeing Capt. Sulu at the helm of his own starship (see? there is a life beyond the Enterprise).Look for an appearance by Michael Dorn, but not as CDR. Worf.I strenuously recommend this film to Star Trek fans who have not seen it yet, and for the rest of you I certainly stand by getting a copy if you don't already have one."
2,Warp 2,"Star Trek is important to me, so much that it's hurts to give a poor review of the final film in the series. I literally cringed listening to some of the awkward dialogue. The film was meaninglessly slow. The action scenes were limited and looked overtly staged. This was the one Star Trek film that really came across like a big floppy TV episode. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home ended the series for this fan."
4,Good service,The disc was in really good condition. There was a sticker on the front that I was unable to get off but overall I was happy with the quality. Shipping was quick.
3,Star Trek 6: Blue for you,"I just purchased a blu-ray, and, the first movies I bought where the Star Trek films. I think that the transfer is good, but, of all six movie in the box set, the only movie that did not skip, or, stick, was Star Trek 4. I found the sticking and skipping to be very uncalled for. I was also unhappy, that, Star Trek 1, 2 and 6 where the original versions of the film. I feel that extended versions are much better and for the price I paid for the set, they should both be included. I found the features to be fun, for the most part. I woul dhave liked to see more behind the scenes stuff, and, promos and hard to find interviews. This is Paramount, and, they have access to anything and everything Trek. To put over three hours of features on a disc, for the sake of doing it, does not make it better. I feel the the blu0ray version of Star Trek (2009) had far better extras than this box set."
1,A waste of good money,"This was a waste of time and money for me. The Title says for collectors and the cover says with prices. I found it to be a loose collection of pictures with VERY little information on any of the dolls. The vast majority of dolls have no priceing and the few that do have, in my opinion, unrealistic prices. Wondered how a publisher would put money into such a waste until I looked. Self published."
4,This is not a Boojum,"This story is available online -- with the illustrations in a separate section. Still, I wanted a paper version. The text is legible, the edges of the illustrations are ""rubbed"" a bit, but that's forgivable.The notes, introductions, etc., are not half of the book, like they are in the updated edition. This is the perfect version for those who want the story without excessive extras."
4,Damn fine funny rhymes,"Yeah, this album is probably one of the funnies rap records that is out right now. Princess Superstar is crazy like none of your business. I usually don't listen to too musch rap, but I'd say this is definitely one of the best records not in rotation at MTV right now."
2,Uhh...I wanted to like this but...,"I heard Princess Superstar on a track with (the ridiculosly funny) MC Paul Barman. I was very impressed with both her wordplay and her delivery. But, then I heard her own solo tracks. To spare the track-by-track rundown, I'll just say the album isn't very entertaining. I have as much respect for killer guest appearances as the next guy, but you have to be able to translate that into a dope album as well. I don't think it happened here. The lyrical content and some of the production earn 2 stars, but I'm saving those other 3 stars for when she becomes more than just a ""one verse MC"". And no, I will not give her extra props for being a white woman in a field dominanted by black men. :)"
4,More of an edge to this one...,"I would like to have given this book 4.5 stars but Amazon doesn't allow that. So since Harriet Klausner (Who is this woman and how does she have time for all those reviews? Does she have no other life?) had already given it 5 stars, I opted for 4.Early Eight definitely had a more edgy tone to it than Fawkes' first two books. Cold Slice and Lights Out both had kind of a warm and fuzzy feel to them; whereas this one is less so. However, I thought the whodunit aspect of Early Eight was much better than the previous books, as Fawkes did a much better job of holding the suspense out until near the end of the book. Good book, looking forward to the next Terry Saltz adventure.Also a technical correction note to the author - on the Andy Griffith Show, I believe it was Barney Fife who said ""Nip it in the bud"", not Aunt Bea."
2,Part- Time working man's non-mystery,I suppose I except to not have solved the crimes less then half way into the book. I find the editing week. Grammer was lacking. The charceters were enjoyable. But they drink more coffee then work. If you are looking for a light mystery then this is it.
4,Nice instrumental album,"I have not seen this movie yet, but this is presumeably the instrumental score (no vocals), which includes two original compostions and several classical pieces.Here are the tracks, since they are in Japanese and not yet listed here:1. Akiko Yano: Takashi to Matsuko no Tango Symphonico2. Mendelssohn: Wedding March from a Midsummer Night's Dream3. Albinoni: AdagioJ. S. Bach: Prelude and Fugue number 8 from the Well-Tempered Clavier4. Prelude5. Fugue6. Mahler: Symphony No. 1L. Mozart: Toy Symphony7. Allegro8. Menuetto9. Allegro moderato -- Allegro -- Presto10. Chopin: Nocturne No. 111. Akiko Yano: Tonari no Yamada-kun no Teema (My Neighbors the Yamadas theme) Orchestra version."
1,Seat Failed Crash Test for IIHS,"I bought this seat three weeks ago because it was rated by Consumer Reports as their safest booster seat that they tested. It also got reasonably good reviews by parents who had purchased it. However, I watched a report on a national news program yesterday regarding crash tests done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on booster seats. Guess which seat they used as an example of the worst qualities in a poor booster seat? You got it, this one. You can go on the IIHS website and see for yourself. It is found under the ""Not Recommended"" category. Needless to say, this carseat is back in the box and on its way back to Amazon."
3,one small problem,"I liked this chair a lot but returned it for one reason... I have a bigger than average 3 year old son and the strap-clip between his legs was too far back on the seat. I had to dig it out from beneath him and even then, the straps were tight on his thighs. If it is small now, it never would have lasted up to 100 pounds (he is only 32 pounds now)."
2,hate hate hate!,"I don't like this seat at all. It is not user-friendly. We had been using Britax car seats, but I didn't want to spend as much money this time. Yet, this car seat feels so awkward and clumsy. The clasps take a lot more effort than my other car seats, and it's even difficult pulling the straps tight ~ not impossible, but it takes a lot more energy. We have another booster for my 5 year old in our other car, and I like that seat a lot more (from Costco). I don't recommend this seat at all; I wish I could get rid of it. It's funny, because the Costco seat was less expensive, but it's obvious that it's a higher quality seat."
4,No Blu-ray?,No Blu-ray? Other than that track listing looks good and I'm sure it will rock since I just saw them and they rocked.
2,A Darker Crimson,"Claudia Donovan is a tough cop in Crimson City, but she has a vulnerable spot, her daughter, Holly. When the girl is captured by demons, Claudia will break her own rules to join forces with a vampire, Korzha, to get her back from the demon realm. A secret Claudia never imagined knocks Claudia for a loop, and the young mother is forced to do things she finds horrible to save Holly, but do them she does. As an added complication,she finds herself caught in a nightmarish ""love"" triangle with a demon who loves and hates her as well as Korzha, whom she does love.** This is an unusual story. Claudia's rape is portrayed in a very disturbing manner. How she falls for Korzha is never clearly defined, and there is a large gap in the background information. If you read this book, be warned, it is a very dark story, invoking a subtle form of horror. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Sad Story,"I enjoy the Crimson City series - some authors more than others. I'm not bagging on Carolyn Jewel's writing style - just her plot / character movement. I gave the book 2 stars because I felt the author was completely WRONG in her choice of ""anti-hero"". For the first time I completely felt that the so called ""bad guy"" should get the girl and the ""anti-hero"" should drop dead. I HATED that Claudia preferred Tiberius to her demon SOUL MATE, Lath. It ruined the book for me. I felt AWFUL over it."
2,"ok, the first few books were WAY better!!!",I love this series. I just did Not like this storyline and plotline. I think it was lacking in just about everything!!!
1,A Disappointment!,"A very disappointing book! I have loved the rest of the series, but could not get ""into"" this book. I found the action sequences disjointed, the jumping from one ""nightmare"" to another confusing. It is not until Chapter 8 that you understand where the heroine is and have an inkling of what is going on. Character introduction is particularly weak. I was also annoyed by hackneyed ploys in speech, (""har har"", ""that's need to know"", and on and on). Though I will read the remainder of the series - I will not finish nor keep this book. Unless you are a real fan of Carolyn Jewel, this book is not recommended."
3,Vishta mates,"I havent read Jewels book, but the person who made a comment about how jewel hasnt read the other books because the vishta mate is wrong. If you recall in Through a Crimson Veil Mika had a demon half brother, which would mean that you can have more than one vishta mate in the series. If you are going to condemnd a person book then make sure the facts are straight"
1,barf,"This is quite possible the worst book I've ever read. The plot is horrible, the characters shallow and there is an icky feeling that you are actually reading a bad Jerry Springer episode. The only characters I liked were the daughter and her pet. The bad guy is hate her/love her and dies way to easy. The good guy doesn't care that it was less than a day and a half since she was forced in mind if not body to ""mate"" with the bad guy before he ""mates"" with her. The whole thing ends with guess who the daddy is for her new baby. The only thing missing to make this story any more tacky is a dna test and a chair throwing fight. I recommend this book if you need a door stop or perhaps some kindling. To bad zero stars isn't an option!"
2,Not that great,"Seems to be where the series is taking a serious downturn. The first three books were relatively well written. This one, however, tries to go dark (think Book 4 of Harry Potter compared to the previous 3) and disturbing and achieved that with a healthy dose of confusing, mainly due to the fact that it wasn't very well written but also because the plot was just...weird.And Carolyn Jewel apparently completely left out the fact that demons can only reproduce with their true mate (can't remember the term...). It really bugs me when people change recognized facts in a series simply to suit their (so-called) plot.I'm still reading the series since each book is written by a different author, so I can't judge the entire series by this one bomb."
3,Scoop Free Cartridge,"It's a good product but it's too expensive; it does keep the odor down; it states that it lasts for 30 days with 1 cat, well it only lasts about 20 days with mine and our cat is outside half the time; the price needs to come down about 40%"
4,Love my Scoop Free,"We have had the Scoop Free for 6 months now. I love it. Best purchase I could have made. I am 3 months pregnant and love the ease of cleaning up. My husband does it without asking. Just lift the top, pull out the cartridge, install a new one and your done!!! You never have to touch or scoop droppings. I have a large 14lbs cat and we can go an entire month between changes. We did have a kitten live with us for 2 weeks. That was alittle more challenging as her droppings were much smaller and often went betweent he rack arms. Works best with an older kitten/cat."
3,my opinion,"this product advertises that it will last for 30 days. I can't even get a full two weeks out of it before my cat is deficating on the floor. The price has also gone up and it is now too expensive. I'm going back to a regular litter box, and do my ""scoop the clumps"" thing!"
4,scoopfree,The product works just like it should! Its worth the extra $ it cost and it was convient to have it sent right to my door as there isnt a place to get it within 50 miles.
2,No...No for LARGE Cats!,I love this sytem and the idea is wonderful but if you have a LARGE cat forget about it. I have a small cat and a LARGE Maine Coone. If you know about cats... he's big! The smaller one does fabulous with this system. The larger will reject it after the cartridge has been used a few days. I then find things on the floor. It fills up rather quickly with the two cats especially one being so LARGE. If you intend to use this with one cat go for it. You'll love it. If there's more than one or a larger size cat you'll be replacing cartridges constantly and racking up the litter bill.
1,Not worth the money,"It works great for about 5 days. I have 2 cats, one small, one about 10 lbs. The box states it wil work with 2 cats from 10-15 days. Well by day 6 it smells by 7 you HAVE to change it. Which wouldn't be so bad itf the replacements weren't so expensive!! With a 3 pk being $50 and you need at least 4 a month that about $68 a month just for litter. I can't afford that. Otherwise would have been nice."
2,Not a big fan of this product,"I orginally bought this litter box because I was pregnant and my husband hates kitty litter. The litter box works fine it's just that it doesn't really clean the urine out. It scoops the poop to the end which is fine, but the urine stays clumped in the box and it stinks. Save your money and scoop the poop yourself!"
5,love it!,"My cat love this! Everty time the box goes off she runs to watch it clean it. She is a Tortoiseshell with what's known as Torti-tude. She is OCD about her litter box. If I didn't clean her box in time, she would knock her poo onto the floor. This litter box has saved me from this. Also, I have it on have it on automatic refill so it just refills on its own every three months. Extremely awesome feature! Not having to remember when then the next order is due saves time and is a lifesaver! Lulu and I love this product!"
4,Pretty good!,Always ships on time. The only negative is that the lining on the bottom of the tray starts peeling within the first few days. Can't quite figure it out. Otherwise it's a great product.
2,ScoopFree litter tray,"The good: The automatic cleaning system with ScoopFree litter is easy to use.The bad: The smell is not absorbed well, and the litter box smells all the time. I own only one (cute) cat."
3,Fresh Step,The product is a good idea although when the weather is very warm it can have an unpleasant odor. In the winter months this was not a problem.
3,Not loved by all cats,"We have a large and a medium sized cat. Our large cat was fine with the crystals, but our smaller cat did NOT like these. We got these crystals (and the litter box) for when we are away because it's just easier on those taking care of our cats not having to scoop. Wellll, we've been away for a total of 4 weeks in the last 7 months and have come home to ""saturated carpet"" which we have since replaced with laminate. This isn't the case with every cat though and our other guy was fine with it.We found the cartridges don't last long and since the crystals hold the liquid it gets really smelly...not to mention the aqua color quickly turns to a greeny-yellow. We've had much better luck with a regular little box and Arm and Hammer litter that controls odors better."
4,Convenient,PRO: Relatively simple to change. Minimal mess.CON: Doesn't always eliminate odor.One indoor medium cat. Regular (not low residue) feed
3,Scoop frre tray size / odor/ cost,"We have two cats. The compartment for solid waste collection is barely large enough to collect solid waste for ten days for the two. Because of this the lid on the storage compartment does not close down when getting full and odor becomes obvious. In additioon I was horrified by the amount of mold/fungus that was growing on the waste - can't be healthy. Because of these issues and the need to replace cartridges frequntly the cost is going to be high!Suggestion - Increase the depth of the box to allow more solid waste to be stored. However, this may require increasing the height of the rake. ??????????"
4,Works Great,I just love this litter box. Great smell works really well.I would have given it 5 stars if it lasted alittle longer.I have one cat it last 2 weeks. I could not live without it.You cant go wrong. Amazon has the best price and it's delivered right to your door.
3,Good and not so good things about this product,"Good points: you don't have to scoop out your litter box every day or every other day and it is extremely easy to switch the old box with the new box.Not so good things about this: If you have two or more cats in your household, this should be changed at least twice a week, not the 10 to 15 days as described in the product description. It starts stinking after about four or five days."
4,Works well for three cats,I love the whole device and the trays are great. We have 3 cats using it and only have to change the box about every 10-14 days.
1,don't buy,does not work very well. even with one cat. does not hide odor. stick to regular litter and just clean each time used. if your lazy then don't get a cat.
3,scoop free,"The refill boxes often get chrunched in shipping within the shipping carton. If this happens and gets deformed, the magnet squares on the refill don't make a good contact with the scoop free box. Then it doesn't open properly. This is the biggest problem I experience with the refills. It has happened several times, and it's a pain. The refills are expensive and should work well."
1,Amazon not fair in stated savings!,"Product is great but AMazon not fair about prices. 3 refill pack, $49.99 & savings of $10? and that includes free shipping!But when I chose the 6 refill pack for $89.99, I noticed over $30 shipping and doesn't qualify for free shipping. In other words, on the 3 pack, you're being charged for shipping in the hidden retail price. Not a happy customer! Bummer, Caveat emptor, buyer beware."
4,"A little pricey, but so much better than typical boxes!","This is so much nicer than regular boxes. I love that you just throw it away. No scooping, no spending a large amount of time inhaling the litter smell when changing while you try to gather the bag without spilling the litter, etc. The only downfall is that with two kitties, I have to replace it more often, but even with the extra cost, it is totally worth it. The box itself has some issues, but that is also worth it. For these issues, see my review on the box..."
3,TOO PRICEY,"For the average, financially middle class cat owner, with 2 cats, this litter cartridge is way too expensive and does not last long enough to make it cost effective. Also, there is NO WAY that this device can be left unattended for 10 - 15 days. The fecal material builds up and MUST be removed with a scoop (even though the instructions say not to do so). In addition the crystals MUST be stirred EVERY DAY to eliminate the build-up of urine which will eventually leak around the sides and corners. It's obvious to me that this costly and temporary cardboard cartridge COULD have been made of a permanent, cleanable, plastic by the maufacturer. This would make the device worth purchasing."
3,Not maintenance free!,"This is not a maintenance free system as advertised. We bought a litter genie and have to scoop the capture tray once a day. There is also a fine white dust from the crystals that gets on anything nearby. We end up replacing the trays every three weeks. On the plus side, the crystals do a good job drying out the poop and keeping odor in check."
1,??????????????????????????????????????,"I cannot believe I cannot get the bags (2/4.4lbs each) of litter delivered to my door as I have been since purchasing my litter box mos. ago. Best litter box I ever owned. I too, have the forever litter tray which solved the ""wet"" urine problem with the refill trays. Hate to go out and buy crystal litter elsewhere, but I guess I'll have to unless I get a reply as to why this has been discontinued.BOO HISS!"
2,Disappointed,"Well we have already gotten rid of this and are back to the old litter box. Our two cats had no problem adjusting to it. However, the cartrdiges needed to be replaced in about a week, and are quite pricey. Also the raking mechanism which I referred to as the poop zamboni often missed deposits and left them there, or got them caught up in the rake, not pretty. In the end this was a very expensive product that was not worth it for us."
3,First experience with crystal litter,"Very nice product, but I either have to either order online or travel 30 miles to the nearest Pet Smart to purchase."
4,Life-saver,"This has made owning a cat an easy prospect. Only problem I have with it is that my cat loves to throw litter around and the space where the cat can sit in is smallish. I'm not sure if its the same as normal liter boxes or if my cat is just crazy though. I had a problem with this before on my old litter box though so it could just be me.Either way, I recommend this product highly. The amount you have to clean up the litter box is negligible. Nothing has gone wrong with it. It costs a lot but makes cat ownership near effortless.Note: I am not a horrible cat owner, I promise"
4,Good product - but know your cat,We have three cats - the 10 year old one took to this instantly - he likes a clean box and now uses this box exclusively - however 3 year old female cat - hated it and refused to go in laundry room at all to even use other boxes - so she took to visiting other areas of the house - 1 year old cat doesn't like it but will use it if I take the other boxes away.
5,Just what I wanted,"The Blu-ray quality of sound and video is perfect for this movie. We found the extras to be illuminating as well. If you love the Beatles and the movie, this is a fine purchase."
4,? Region A?,Region A? Is there? Region A? Hm? Is there Region A? I would buy it if it were...Lives in the USA
5,"Another hole in my pocket, but worth every shilling!","Cleanest, clearest version I've ever seen. Unlike the DVD releases the full frame has been used so there are no cut off heads! Hey Bulldog is in, love it or hate it.The sound is uncanny in remastered DTS-HD Master. It sounds like, for the songs, the master session tapes were used because the clarity and seperation are amazing.Fun for all ages and if you haven't a copy of this movie yet this is the one copy to buy."
4,Way better,The DVD version of this movie was copied from the VHS. The quality was not very good. The Blu-ray version in comparison is like night and day.
5,yellow submarine,never been a big fan of the Beatles but I really enjoyed the movie and the music and it really s
3,Flash-back,"This might sound dated but, you don't have to remember the 60's to enjoy the 60's. Good music is timeless. The visuals in Blu-ray are worth the expierence."
5,Beatles on Blu-Ray!,"This is an excellent transfer of the film. I've owned the VHS version, the DVD, and now the Blu-ray. Without question the Blu-ray with its remastered video is a revelation. Colors are better, the picture is the sharpest its ever been and the music is well, still the Beatles which means if you're a fan it's a no-brainer. This is the same version as the DVD which means it includes ""Hey Bulldog"" and a few other minor changes from the VHS release. The audio is available in both a new HD surround track or the original film version.The movie itself is very simple but wonderfully weird as it involves freeing Pepperland from the clutches of the ""Blue Meanies"", with numerous Beatles songs along the way. If you like the Beatles, psychedelic animation, or cultural artifacts from the 1960's this is a great buy."
3,I don't understand.....,"Did they remaster the Mod Oddessy special because the 1999 version was NOT remastered. Regardless, I don't understand how it is they took the film in 1999 and remastered it to add in the Hey Bulldog sequence only to take the 1968 version and remaster it for Blue Ray, presumably now again without the Hey Bulldog sequence. Also, why don't the extra's include both segments to show viewers the difference. Even more, the 1999 remaster went through P.Gabriel's 48 track set up to remaster the sound. Did they take the 1968 source and remaster it or did they take the 1968 remastered versions for the iTunes iPod and USB promos, or what? I mean, how many times do I need to by the soundtrack, the song track, and the film on DVD? Stop messing with my childhood Apple Ltd., seriously. Pick a version, you're confusing the kids, those who grew up on it and those who will shortly."
5,Yellow Submarine,"I had Yellow Submarine on my wish list for several months. Finally purchased it through Amazon last month. Now it's outon Blue Ray. Should have waited just a little longer. Oh well can't complain, still a fabulous film."
2,Longtime Fan,"I am sadden to read that the release of this will not include the VH1 1999 Special where the remaining Beatles dicuss Yellow Submarine for those whom may not be aware it was VH1 Special on the re-released of the Yellow Submarine film, this special showed behind the scenes of the producing of the movie, and containd with new interviews with the three surviving beatles Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, among others who produced the movie!Next is why did they place a new voice over on the trailer?A huge crying shame is they also did not include the BBC doumentary about the film. This is simply a shame they dropped the ball on this. I ill buy this and I love the Bealtes forever. Who is in charge here?"
2,A vision of a time long past,"Wow. I was really looking forward to viewing the Blu-Ray - I had not seen the film for over 20 years.Technically, the transfer is excellent. Content-wise, it was like putting on a pair of paisley bell bottom pants. You look at it and think ""What the hell is that?""The colors and graphics are vintage Peter Max style eye-exploding visuals. The story and dialogue are mostly mumbles and nonsense.You might want to consider renting this - anybody want to buy my used copy? Just viewed once!"
5,After waiting forever...,"What more can be added to all the other reviews of this iconic Beatles classic? Yellow Submarine on Blu-ray is a wonderful addition to any Beatle fan's collection. It has quickly become my daughter's favorite movie! The music makes us all smile, of course, and she loves to sing along with all of the songs. We couldn't be happier!"
5,Silly,"It was silly when I was nine years old, but I loved it. It is still silly now that I'm 53 years old. I still love it. Not sure if this is about me or the movie..."
4,classic,Animated beatles at their finest. It's pretty strange but always fun. Loved the little extras that come with this dvd
3,Beatles in DTS MASTER AUDIO!!!!,"bought this blu ray to see how good the beatles sound in lossless DTS master audio. In a word ""INCREDIABLE"". hope i don't die before the beatles albums are released in a hi rez format of either SACD or BLU RAY AUDIO DISC. the art film was GODAWFUL"
4,Another great video for Barney lovers!,"My 2-year-old Barney fan loves almost everything about this video. The ""Down on Grandpa's Farm"" song is the same tune as ""We Like the Shapes"" from her first Barney video and she was thrilled that she already knew it - as well as ""What I Want to Be"" and ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" in outer space! She also loves the cute ""Keep Your Sneeze to Yourself"" sequence at the veterinarian's office, and the ""Mac & Cheese"" song, since that's her favorite food! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because she really loses interest in the rock & roll sequence at the end. I think one song would've been enough, but they do two rock songs in a row and she actually walks away - then comes back when they finish! That and she also asks where Baby Bop is -it would've been nice to include her."
2,Thumbs down,"We didn't like the video, kids being wild and acting like Rock Stars was not the kind of video we were looking for...creative play is one thing, hedonism is not a value I want to teach my children."
4,Vesala is a god,"Great session of mostly unknown (to me) musicians of northen europe playing a Garbarek-ish, 70's ecm-ish, style of Jazz. I bought this because i am a big fan of Edward Vesala and this is his last recording before he died. And what a farewell it is. His drumming is simply unique and will be hard to imitate. As for the band it is also interesting because it has a superb vibraphonist and a great bass player. Also the saxophonist leader and composer is worth a mention as he is obviously a tremendous player with enough chops to keep you attentive and the tunes he penned are very well composed. Nice and recommended specially to followers of northen jazz and Vesala's work."
5,Simple and Plain. This is One Durable Salad/Pasta Bowl,Corelle plates and bowls have been with our household ever since I remember.We used to have (we still have them but they are on the shelves) Corelles with color designs but we decided to stick with simple plain ones which is easier to match.Pros:-Durable. Me and my wife have dropped them many times; and they don't break easily.-Light. Less stress for our kitchen shelves.-Microwave safe-Easy to clean-Dishwasher safe
3,pasta bowl,"3 stars for price...bowl is super.This is a GREAT bowl, but I bought the EXACT same bowl at Walmart for $3.12."
5,Great for everyday use!,I use these bowls all the time! They are shallow enough to be used like a dish but like them as a bowl to eat pasta or stews. They are super useful!
2,Too Small,wanted a bowl twice this size. probably will hold up well and last long time I am sure of that.
3,Threat Level,"I am not qualified to write a balanced review on this book because I know nothing about maneuvers, strategy, tactics, and would have problems identifying a weapon as either an AK-47 or a BB gun, except that one is bigger and more complicated than the other. I am impressed by characterization of Storey and his cohort, which gets better as the book goes along. This book and its sequel, as well as several other books Mr. Christie has written, are not for 72 year old females who have never gotten near a war/military action. But it is well written and I would think that military minded people would like it very much.Linda Sheean"
4,Threat Level,"Good book, kind of grim though. It left me feeling like the world is going to hell in a hand-basket."
5,Amazing,Love it. This is the best original sound track off all time in my opinion. Deep music and inspiring melodies!
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!",I was disappointed to find these MP3s are mediocre rehashes and NOT the brilliant original arrangements from the film soundtrack. I don't understand why this inferior version was produced when the wonderful soundtrack was already on the shelf and only had to be ripped to MP3 format. Go figure. I'll have to hunt down the original soundtrack CD to get the good versions.
2,A Travesty of the Original,"I bought this because I lost my original (and I mean ORIGINAL) in a fire. This, on the other hand, represents false advertising. It is billed as the ""Original Motion Picture Score"" but it is not. It's not even close. They've taken the most beautiful movie soundtrack ever recorded and destroyed it. It's difficult to listen to - it's noisy, all nuance is removed from it. This is the soundtrack as if played by some high school band. Do not buy it. Buy the original. I will. This was a mistake. There should be a disclaimer on the cover such as ""based on the original motion picture score."""
2,Here's how bad it is....,"Don't get me wrong, the score is beautiful! This recording is not great. To me, the sound is a bit brassy and tinny. Get the original recording instead, especially since you get the nice pop song from the original version of the movie. Here's evidence that this recording was thrown together hastily: The liner notes say ""A Longstocking Tale"" and anyone who knows anything about James Fenimore Cooper and his classic novels knows that they are ""The LEATHERSTOCKING Tales"". Who knows how they made that mistake but it's quite embarassing!"
1,Last of the Mistakens,"I always imagine the scenes with the music only to realize that the music is only good while you are watching the movie. Alone, it is a cacaphony of noise. Only one of the ending songs had any interest, but it is not worth inserting the CD for just one. One of these days I will wise up about soundtracks.Skip the recording. Watch the movie instead."
2,A beginner book....,"If you you are just starting out then this book may work for you. With regard to using the text as a reference or just to brush up on your Access then it failed miserably. Because the practice chapters build on each other, you practically have to work through all of the previous chapters to build up the database, thus if you skip chapters and work on your topic of interests, the database failed because of missing data that was supposedly created during the previous chapters, which is pretty much useless as as brush up text."
3,Dragon Ashes Disapointing Single,"I am dragon ashes number 1 fan from the usa.However the song ""Summer Tribe"" isnt that great.You either like DA for thier laid back sing-a-long songs(Grateful Days,Life Goes On,Shizukana Hibi No Kaidin Wo)or their intense punkish style(Deep Impact, Bring It,Fantasista)But this single is tryin to get that layed back feel to it but the beat and tempo of it mixes horribly and the remix of it isnt any better.However the 2 versions of ""Episode 2"" are allright.Its a mediocore song.If your a die hard DA fan (Like Me) this isnt horrible but its not at all that great.if i could i would give this a 3.5 stars."
3,Lovely doll but poor cultural sensitivity,"The May Lin Collector's doll is lovely, with beautiful accessories and clothes. I was disappointed that the MGA people didn't give her a Japanese name (my 7 year old daughter renamed her Kyoko), especially when they went out of their way to create this Tokyo a go go collection. Yes, these are toys and kids use their imaginations, and maybe it is a Chinese girl trying on a kimono. I still think the makers of Bratz need to do a bit more homework the next time they release a special edition, culturally themed doll."
5,May Lin is the Bomb,"...or so says my 10 year old daughter. We've given a couple as gifts and they always go over well. If you have a girl who likes Bratz Dolls, she'll really enjoy receiving this gift."
5,Cool toy,This is a very cul toy and Bratz r the best dolz Evr.So Pu-leaze by Bratz and not Dumb old My Scene dolls.GO BRATZ No .1 Fan LPG3LNC
4,i love her! best tokyo a go go doll! GET IT!!,"i love bratz. and this one is one doll i own, and i absolutely love her!she has a kimono gown, and a stand plus is a a collector's edition doll.i play with her everyday along wih dana,phoebe,nevra,cloe,and meygan.i love this doll. i give her 4 stars though because she is not very educational. i love her, get may lin!"
5,TRADITIONAL Japanise!!!!!,"First of all, she IS Japanise NOT Chinise! And second of all she is really cool and i don't care what you all have to say! I don't care if u have lived in Japan or stayed there this doll is coooool!!!!!!!"
1,Why do they have CHINESE NAMES?,You'd think the Marketing department would do some research before nameing their dolls especially when they claim it's a Japanese Doll! May Lin is Chinese....
2,May Lin isn't Japanese.,"May Lin is a CHINESE name, not Japanese. Haha. Also, she doesn't have a nose. Don't you think that's kinda weird? And her lips are like permanently in a kissing position. Hmm. But I do like her clothes. I think that My Scene are a better influence on girls, but Bratz DO have better clothes.Hey, why would you pay 40 bucks for a doll?"
5,Shut your mouth,"FYI, this is a beautiful Bratz doll, not a ugly dumb My Scene doll. Bratz dolls are better and you know it. Bratz won years ago and My Scene dolls lost before they were made. My Scene SUCK, and Bratz RULE. You know that, I know that, the whole world knows that, the whole entire universe knows that. Get over it My Scene losers. Bratz rule My Scene drool. Ha-ha-ha to you My Scene loser."
2,don't listen to those other reviews,"listen up, you people. you might say she's ugly or something, but she's not. it doesn't HAVE to look like it does in the real world! the creators of this doll are trying their best to keep you satisfied. my mom wanted this so bad- she won't let me open it. she didn't care about the name. she liked it because it's beautiful, and she doesn't see things like that anymore.may lin is a fine and pretty name. it also doesn't matter if the kimono doesn't look like a real one.you just have to be happy that they made you a dol like this."
5,Good but needs help !,"I love Maylin but why is she yellow I mean c'mon she should be white , if you shop on the Walmart website you'll find Kumi dressed in a red and blue kimono and she's white not yellow but other than this everythings fine with her."
3,your right brats sholud get sued,"I think your so right about IT. and you shut, shut up.my scene is so better then brats because the feet don't pop off and they have a nose and brats needs BOTOX for a nose job and they need to move outta japan, they need to stop being so ''boy crazy'' and the motto of brats is ''boys,frineds,fashon'' they need to get a grip life is not like that it's about family,school,. and brats don't even think about family do they have a family??? oh I fogot they don't so they don't got family they don't got a home and if they don't got a home they are HOMLESS!!!!!!!!!!! STREET RATS!."
3,may lin?,"i know it is not to die for, but it is very narrow-minded to call the doll May Lin if she's japanese..and also..kimonos tied on front ...prostitutes wear them like that...oh well..if people make chinese ""Mulan"" wear a japanese kimono and geisha get-up, i guess THIS is not that harmful..."
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hate Bratz. They are trashy and not worth the price. Get a My Scene doll, they are better. Guess what, My Scene haters? My Scene are better than Bratz! My Scene rules! Bratz drool! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!!!!!! Bratz suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Nice little chopper but overpriced,"These are handy little choppers but why higher price for the shorter handle ? I have the shorty and the slightly longer version which I prefer. The larger splitting axes are really great. I have one with the splitter head which will out perform larger heavier axes. They are really a Fiskars in the first place with Gerbers name on them. I repeat, this little ax is way overpriced !"
4,Nice n Lite,"I needed a lightweight axe for my weekend hikes and backpacks. This axe is just the thing. Lightweight, well made and not too exepensive. Hilds a very sharp edge."
3,"It's a good book, but the title is deceiving","I'm an artist - I work with metal, gemstones, glass, paper, fabrics... everything requires a workbench. I bought this book with the dream of creating MY perfect bench. However, what isn't made clear in the title of the book description is that this book is ONLY for the concept of creating a workbench for woodworking. Wood happens to be one material that I don't work with. I don't have a carpenter's shop and don't need a woodworking workbench. The photos are splendid and the book covers a great many needs and possibilities for woodworking. I've yet to figure out if it's applicable for what I need."
4,Great photos,"Great photos of some of the most widely know and respected woodworkers at their benches. I have not read the book in depth, as yet, but the photos are worth the cost of the book alone."
4,Lots of great ideas and stimulating photographs,"This book has a lot of good ideas, great pictures and plans. I especially appreciate Schleining's review of what modern masters, including Sam Maloof and the late Tage Frid, are using/used. I would have liked to see more coverage of classic benches - only a couple of shaker benches and Henry Studley's (amazing) bench are included.I have already built most of my bench but I sure wish I'd had this book before I got started. I would definitely have done things differently.Workbench tops, bases, built-in cabinets, vises, hold-downs, deadmen etc. are all covered. I am looking to add a tail vice and several good plans are included.This is a very good and quite complete book. Highly recommended."
4,Costly book to own.,What a great book. Fascinating to read about the history and variety of workbenches.Problem: I have spent far too much money rebuilding the benches in my shop due to the insiration from this book.
5,excellent resource for ideas when building a work bench,"Prior to purchasing this book I heard several negative comments that the book does not give you ""blueprints"" for a workbench. This is true. However, I'm on my sencond night reading through this book and have found it to be both inspirational and informative. Lets face it. If you wanted a ""complete"" guide to workbenches it would contain multiple volumes to cover a variety of perspecitives. Relax people. Workbenches have been around since practically the dawn of time, and it's impossible to cover every topic in one book. I found this book to be a well thought out on everything related to putting together a workbench."
5,Great book,"Until I got that book I didn't know what a useful tool a good workbench could be. I had been getting by for years with makeshift creations thrown together from scrap, but after reading this book I was inspired to build a good woodworker's bench with a pattern maker's vise and bench dogs out of maple.The book is full of terrific ideas for every budget and time commitment. Some of them, like the pipe clamp bench are ingenious. I only wish I had time and space to build all of the ideas in this book. Even if you only have the time and budget to throw something together from scrap, this book will help you get the most out of your workbench."
3,"Was satisfied, changed mind due to malfunction","I was very pleased with the Nike watches that I purchased from Timezone123 and the customer service team when an exchange was needed due to a scratch. Since that time, both watches have needed batteries which cost me $16.00. Being a new watch, I was surprised that new batteries would be needed less than a month after the purchase. I contacted customer service and no reply which was disappointing."
1,DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"Within hours of receiving the product ordered, it stopped working. I contacted the seller twice to inquire about a refund and received no response."
1,stay a way from this junk,"I wish I could give it a zero star,I have never seen such a junk software,I think this was designed early 90s,it took me about 10 hours to figure out how it works,tech support is (0),It will not work with wireless printers,image in how out dated is this software,on package says 30 days money back guaranty<I called they said if you buy directly from us,but you know if you buy software from electronic store and open it you can't return it so it goes my $180 dollar down the drain,stay w way from it save your money and headache ."
5,Handbook of Plastics Analysis,"Fast shipping, next day delivery.! Great! And product in great shape.Thanks,"
1,Not what was expected!,This product was very complicated with no instructions. When a medical professional tried to assemble the pieces they did not fit making it useless! We sent it back and were disgusted as it was a Xmas present that went bad! We do not reccomend for any age!
5,Very Impressed!,"I truly enjoyed this story and it was well done by Ms. Clark. The research that she puts into the storyline leaves the reader feeling the pain Augusta must endure and the painful guilt that the Hero must experience. To not give the subject of the plot away, you will find at the end the full awareness of the subject matter and the growing deep love that was developed between this couple. If you like Beverly Clark's work check out her other two books: A Love To Cherish and The Price of Love."
5,Very pleased with this case...,"Received item on time. Case is very well made and neatly packaged. Belt clip seems unsafe due to the fact that it is detachable and held on by one screw. If you are planning to wear your Palm on a belt all the time, I do not recommend a detachable belt clip on any case. It is best then to buy a non-detachable belt clip case. Overall I am very satisfied with the excellent quality of the product."
3,silences sounds,"My Palm fits the cover, but I don't like it that it silences sounds. They should make a hole where there is a speaker."
1,Dead spot. Poor customer service.,"Purchased this and paid a professional mechanic to install it. After about a week, the car occasionally failed to start, making a click noise when turning the ignition key. Rocking it back and forth in 2nd gear would get it started. Clear sign of a dead spot. I called the Quality-built customer service number and was told by one of their reps that it was likely a poor installation with a break in the grounding.After checking the connections myself to no avail, I just decided to head over to Advanced Auto Parts, pick up a reconditioned starter, and swapped them out myself. As expected, problem solved. I should have saved myself the trouble and the cash and simply installed a reconditioned starter myself from the beginning. Lesson learned."
3,It's OK...,"I have had this book since it first hit the shelfs and I have not made a single quilt in it. I do love to make mini quilts and have made many, many, little quilts. This book just did not get me quilting. If it's cheap and you want an easy mini quilt book then think about it. Other wise save your money."
3,"Interesting, but not all the songs play well","This book consists of 12 songs: One, Harvester of Sorrow, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Nothing Else Matters, The Unforgiven, Enter Sandman, Until It Sleeps, Fade to Black, Seek and Destroy, The Thing That Should Not Be, Sad But True and Mama Said.Basically, some of the songs play a lot better than others. The more recent ballads like NEM and Unforgiven are excellent on the piano, but Harvester, Seek and Thing just don't really translate well to the keyboard.I think you'll enjoy at least half of this collection if you like Metallica and you've played the piano for at least a couple of years. It's not beginner music, but most of it is fairly straightforward to play. I was a bit disappointed at the transcription of some of the solos -- they leave some of them out -- then again, they were meant for guitar and not piano."
2,Grips just okay for Bike restoration,"Used to bring back a 96 GT or Diamond Back. They look great with soft material like the 80's style. Perfect price, should have bought a 2nd pair. No worries with these grips.Updated: after 8+ months these grips start to split between the design (appearing like 1/2"" long slice). I thought it was just one grip, but no. I bought 2 pairs and they are are doing this indiscriminately on each grip. Only good for a small amount of time, not long lasting. Now looking for better grips."
5,Best investment for your family's health.,"Our first case lasted us almost two years. We installed dispensers in each of our four bathrooms and one in our kitchen. Two of our bathrooms are infrequently used (by comparison) so these 1000ml sizes lasted quite awhile. But the work they did was admirable. The transmission of viruses and such was much less in the time we've had these, and I am very pleased that we made the investment in this product in our home. I know that most people buy Purell type products in those little pump dispensers at the grocery store, but they are wasting their money. If you do any kind of per ounce comparison, this is the way to go."
3,You are NOT buying a case of 8,"Buyer beware you are NOT buying a case of 8, you are buying ONE (1) refill.......The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because when I found out I only got 1 refill I immediately called them up and they said it was a mix up w/ Amazon and gave me a full refund, customer service was very friendly."
4,Great for a novice!,Good as a study companion to the DSM-IV TR. Worth looking into for the student who wants case study scenarios or vignettes to accompany the diagnosis.
4,Does help,This book does help one understand the DSM IV. Hopefully there will be one for the DSM V for us graduate students and clinicians.
5,An invaluable tool in tackling the complexity of DSM IV.,"Morrison does an excellent job of breaking down the complex difficulties of diagnosis into a manageable, thorough and above all readable guide. Where DSM - IV is daunting and impersonal, DSM-IV Made Easy guides the reader with an evident understanding of the difficulties faced not only by the uninitiated but also the experienced. Well written vignettes help bring DSM's disorders to life and step by step diagnoses are invaluable tools in learning to apply DSM's vast criteria. This book is organized, detailed, accessible and all but essential in wading through the tricky waters of DSM IV."
4,The DSM-IV Made Easy,"I do not know how I would have gotten through my first experience having to use the DSM as a diagnostic tool for my graduate work in psychopathology without this book. I used it to work up all my case presentations, and they were always accurate. Thank you, James Morrison!"
1,A Psychic Prediction,"I predict this book's sales at Amazon.com will decline rapidly starting May 6, 2000. (The good thing about this prediction is that if I'm wrong, none of us will know!)"
3,Good content - Bad choice of title!,"There's a lot more to this book than the title suggests. Ifyou like archaeology, mythology and ancient science you'll probablyenjoy this one."
1,Save your money.,"The planets are mostly lining up on the OTHER side of the sun, where they'll have even less influence than usual; the last time these planets were aligned (actually more closely than the impending event) was in the 1960s; buy a decent book on astronomy instead. There are plenty here on Amazon!"
1,True Prophesy.....yeah right,"Well seeing as how it is Nov 13 2000, 6 months after d-day, I think its safe to say this book is a crock. The premise of this book is that on May 5, 2000 a huge iceberg or ice cap is going to explode and we will all die....Im waiting and Im not holding my breath, are you?"
3,WE SURVIVED!,"Well, there's always next year, or as the article that I read today on the Internet said, two years. Another planetary alignment will occur in May of 2002, so there's still time for a new edition of this book to come out.Given what I read today, I guess one of the pivot points was in Georgia, for that was where Noone was reportedly sequestered with his family.Seriously, I think the biggest problem with Noone's thesis is that it is contingent upon a buildup of ice in the South Pole. The opposite has taken effect since the book was published.Still, it was a fascinating book to read.I wonder if the people of Adelphi and Stelle actually did the giant airlift today?"
1,I suppose it really was the ultimate disaster...,"If you were Mister Noone. Now, at least, we can move on to other dates of mystical significance, like December 22nd, 2012 and so on. When nothing happens then, I suppose we'll be forced to endure life until its inevitable end. ""We know not the day, nor the hour."" It's cruel of me to enjoy this, but then again, at least I'm still alive, and not buried under a glacier, as Mister Noone would have me."
2,"Well, Looks Like We all are still here! May 6","Hey, Were all still here! I mean 5 4 3 2 1 zero BOOM! Were all dead... I mean things can happen but nothing happen this time! I sure hope that everyone in the world don't dog the guy who wrote this book. Cause he had a stong point. And whos knows maybe, just maybe... He was right about the planets and all.. But what if it was May 5, but like 2048 or something like that! I have to give the author of this book credit. Take Care! Glad were all still Here! God Bless Thanks For Reading! =)"
4,There's actually a band dedicated to this idea!,"There's actually a band dedicated to this idea called 5/5/2000. Apparently they were heavily influenced by Richard Noone and these scientist's ideas so much that they made extremely heavy ambient music to accompany the idea that the world would end of 5/5/2000. Of course it did not, but they continued on to do another couple of records, BOTH available here on Amazon.com! Worth checking out, they're pretty interesting actually. The perfect music to imagine the end of the world by... by... by... by... by........"
3,"Intriguing, but not convincing","The author makes a good case for the argument that a highly developed civilization antedating the Egyptian pharaohs by thousands of years actually constructed the Great Pyramid (but not the other pyramids; he contends the pharaohs were copying the Great Pyramid). However, the weak point in his argument, or so it seems to me, is his attempt to tie in the alignment on May 5, 2000 to the earth flipping on its axis on that date. I seem to recall a book entitled""The Jupiter Effect"" in the 70's that forecast major earthquakes sometime in the early 80's (I forget the exact date and year), based on an alignment of the planets on that date.Time will tell, of course; here's hoping he's wrong."
1,Noone Causes Needless Worry,"While Noone's book is entertaining, it is fiction. Previous reviewers have pointed out the errors in the text. The planets indeed have been more aligned in the past, and the erratic weather has been predicted by everyone from Nostradamus to Bob Ryan on the Channel 4 News. There are more scientific and explainable reasons for everything. The great pyramid, a water pump? It would have been nearly impossible for something made of limestone to have any engineering purpose at all. As for the 5/5/2000 proposition - he makes people worry needlessly, as most soothsayers do. Never proven, with no foundation... Noone is a charlatan."
1,"Well, here we are in 2012...","This book was silly when it was published, and is merely tedious today. Its author displays a depressing lack of knowledge of his subjects, and then there is the acid test: did the events happen?They didn't. And Masonic membership is declining so rapidly (as opposed to his badly dated idea of a giant Masonic conspiracy) that Masons are now *advertising*. Sigh.Meaningless, tedious, repeats other conspiracy nonsense and is plain wrong. Less than one star."
2,All over the map -- literally,"The subject spread in this book is all over the map. If the subjects are related, the reader must intuit it . . . and they may be. The author is not mainstream, which is refreshing but sometimes frustrating. I wish for him a good editor and new title.Although I do not rate this book high for its smorgasboard topics, the revised edition's Epilogue rates a 5 simply for passing on Kunkel's theory that the Great Pyramid was a vacuum or hydraulic pump, complete with drawings and explanations. Since Kunkel self-published, his work may be lost except as preserved in Noone's book. Hats off to Noone for this alone.P.S. It's 5-21-00. The publisher should now lose the 5-4-00 fear-based readership, thank goodness."
5,Completely amazing!,"Not the book, the fact that you're reading this considering that the world has already ended!"
3,"Interesting Pyramid Speculation, Don't buy the Ice Disaster","Not overly-scientific, but explains to the layman many of the fascinating aspects of the great pyramid.It seems his premise about the Antarctic Ice Shelf is wrong. He says it is growing thicker. Isn't it melting? I tend to believe there have been polar shifts in our past, but find it hard to believe that anyone can nail it down to the next date when it will happen."
1,Learn from my mistake!,"What a disappointment this book is. I bought it in 1997, began reading it in mid 1999, and just finished it today (July 8,2000). Obviously Noone's predictions were in error. But perhaps there were other redeeming characteristics, such as the history and philosophy surrounding the origins and purpose of the Great Pyramid. Forget it. All one gets from the text is repetitive, pseudomystical mumbo-jumbo couched in dogma and supported by multiple ""interviews"" with scholars and obscure references to the mysteries of the Freemasons. Certain passages border on rampant racism, too, as contemporary Arab culture is described as beneath the moral and social standards of even barbaric medieval Europe. Read Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World instead. 5/5/2000 is a waste of time."
5,tennessee is laughably bad,"I find it quite ironic how someone from Chattanooga, TN can talk about scientific theories, talk about a contradiction. Tend to your moonshine stills. Charlie"
1,FUNNY,"How funny,,,just want to get peoples' money to issue this book.....so today is the 5 5 2000 and no thing happend...everyone is having a normal day ..so please I read this book,,and it does not make sence for me and for the CNN and for the most expert people and the most thing that prove for you that this book is wasteless is that today is that 5 5 2000...FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY"
1,Did I just see a pig fly by?,"Well, the world better not end because May 5 is my birthday and this might possibly spoil the party. As far as the book, nothing happened on 2/5/62 when the planets were closer to being aligned so I'm not worried. Maybe I should make up a date and write a book about the world ending that day. There is always a slight chance I could be right."
2,"5-5-2000 Hides more ""truth"" than it shows.","I've just finished reading Richard Noone's 5-5-2000. While it contains some interesting takes on the great pyramid mystery as well as info. on a shift of the earth's magnetic poles on 5-5-2000, it ended up being basically an ""infomercial"" recruiting folks to join up with the Freemasons. Consider yourself warned!!"
1,Just Plain Weird,"I've tried all sorts of yoga and this one takes the cake for weirdness! If you are athletic and like Rodney Yee's tapes, this one is not for you. Too New Age."
2,Not much stretching,"I have done some yoga and was expecting more stretching and holding poses than I felt that this video had to offer. I did enjoy the live music but the endurance portion was pointless as I've already had one baby and can't imagine slapping your hands together above your head and below your waist for 3 minutes daily would have helped me at all during labor. If you're serious about stretching , don't bother with this one."
1,Disappointing,"I have done about a year of Iyengar and Hatha yoga and was looking for something of a high beginner/intermediate standard. This workout is NOT what I had expected. There are no asanas/poses. It is more a very low impact stretch/calisthenics routine. She talks WAY too much, as another reviewer also commented. Even with the sound down I found it annoying. Contrived and corny. I would NOT recommend this at all. If you want a 'yoga' class try Prenatal Yoga. This is a pseudo-yoga tape. If you want very easy low-impact stretches, dancing and movement then this will help you."
2,I wasn't into the chanting,"This video has provides some good excerises, but it's a little weird. I had to fast forward through the chanting and the meditation.. it was just too much for me. The instructor is a little on the new age side (she wears a turbin). Not the video for you if you don't like the radical new age stuff..."
4,Very Relaxing DVD,"I really like this DVD, though I didn't use it as much as I had planned. The instructor is a little off the wall at times, but the exercises are great and helpful."
1,SNL Skit,"I am admittedly not that into yoga, although I am very active. I have been a bit stiff so I decided to try this yoga DVD. The instructor was hard to take seriously and I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit. I don't mean to take away from those that are very into yoga but this particular DVD was terrible. I had to struggle to make it even 25 minutes into the DVD and I finally just gave up. Unless you like cult like music and bizarre references to your relationship with your growing body and your baby this is NOT the right solution for you. I would still like to stretch more so I am going to search for a more straight forward yoga DVD."
3,"OK Exercise, Made me Want to Giggle","There's a passage where the instructor asks you to imagine you're experiencing the beauty of squatting to deliver a baby naturally in a foreign land, in the forest, surrounded by woodland creatures and many mothers and midwives. If this scenario appeals to you, this is your perfect video. If not, and you can make a go at the one-with-my-child-and-the-earth thing for the benefits of the exercise, it's still an ok yoga video (though a drawback is that there's no time spent making sure that postures are done properly to minimize injury.) Focuses on both strength and flexibility."
2,Choose another prenatal video,"The first time I watched this video, my thoughts were, ""Give me a break!"" That hasn't changed. It is a little too ""new age"" for my taste and the exercises were not to my liking. It is not a relaxing video. Instead it is repetitious with a lot of emphasis ""exercise"" rather than the traditional yoga poses which emphasize strength, balance, and flexibility. I recommend to potential buyers, ""Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea."" That video is far better than this one."
3,The New Method Prenatal Yoga,"I like the exercises, and for the most part, I like the music. But, I can't stand that lady's incessant talking!! How are you supposed to relax, and close your eyes, and get into the music, and look into your inner self, when she just won't shutup!! I didn't pay much for the DVD, and I'm glad. If they put out a video where they mute most of her talking, please let me know!!"
3,"too much talk, not enough yoga","I've been doing yoga for over 5 years now and I've found it to be really helpful for strength, toning, and relaxation. When I suddenly found myself pregnant (at 39), I wanted to continue with my yoga practice, but wanted to be sure the poses were compatible to pregnancy. So, I bought this video, hoping for guidance since I don't have a teacher right now. While the philosophy of yoga has always interested me, I was hoping for more work with postures and less talk about how wonderful yoga is for me and for my baby. At this point, I'm hoping to find either another video with more poses or a teacher who can give me a safe program. I'm really disappointed with this video."
1,Waste of money,"Don't get this video if you have done any form of Yoga previously. This video is very weird and useless when it comes to ""exercising""."
1,a huge disappointment,"i was disappointed by this video. i felt that it was too ""touchy feely,"" without giving SPECIFIC instructions for the positions she spoke about. in other words, i felt that this wasn't a yoga class. the amature videoing of the studio didn't help and though there are a number of women in various stages of pregnancy, it is never directly pointed who is in the right posture, and who isn't. i am not new to yoga, but know that i have different concerns now that i am pregnant. quite honesly, my back ached more after the video, and i sent it back the next day."
3,Great if your'e into New Age or a Kundalini type practice...,"I've been a Family Practice Clinician for 5 years and a yoga practioner for more than 25 years. One thing holds true for both medicine and yoga: everyone's needs are different. This tape is perfect for the woman who wants to relax and get more comfortable with the changes in her body before she brings her baby into the world. Though neither the classic Hatha nor physically demanding Astanga styles, the Kundalini practices in this video are quite challenging, both physically and mentally. It is a bit ""New Age"" oriented, which some viewers may not care for-try to get get past the turbans and the chanting. The breathing techniques and the encouragement to ""let yourself be uninhibited"" are quite valuable to help prepare for the labor and delivery process."
1,No Thanks.,"This was definitely NOT the yoga tape for me. There were very few true yoga postures, mostly chanting and flowing movements. I kept waiting for familiar yoga moves....and waiting....and waiting. I did not feel as if I got much in the way of good stretching."
2,If you're a yoga person....,"If you're a yoga person (Iyengar and other similar forms) looking to continue doing yoga during pregnancy, this video is not for you. It is not based on adapting traditional poses (traingle, warrior series, side angle, etc.)However, it is relaxing and has some good points to consider for labor and delivery if that's what you are looking for."
1,warning; don't arch your back like this when pregnant!!!,"This video is based on kundalini yoga, which is very different than what most people think of as 'yoga,' which is usually hatha yoga. There is a lot of chanting in it, too, and not really any asanas, b/c that's not what kundalini is about. (I've studies some kundalini when not pregnant.)I like the imagry the yogi presents, but her methods are very bad for pegnant bodies ... arching your back when pregnant can cause all sorts of problems (see the book Essential Exercises for the Childbearing Year, by Elizabeth Noble for more details about why arching the baby is bad during pregnancy).I just wanted to warn everyone -- BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS VIDEO! (or any other program that tells you to arch your back while pregnant)I did get a good sweat going, but it was hard to modify the movement not to arch my back, so I want to return the video."
2,Just shut up and let us think.,"I've been doing yoga for three years. Continuing the practice through my pregnancy kept me in the best shape possible helped keep the aches and pains of pregnancy under control. I thought this tape adapted movements from the Kundalini practice well, but the teacher is a bit of a nut. Using gereralizations such as ""scientists say"" discredits her opinions. And frankly, she talks too much. It's impossible to concentrate with her constant yappping."
3,Good video to add to your prenal workouts,"After having morning sickness for 3 1/2 months it was hard for me to exercise regularly. At 4 months pregnant I starting exercising with this video. It is not rigorous, and even if you are tired you will have enough energy to do this. However, I fast forward during the chating session, there is one at the beginning and one towards the end. I found myself to have more energy and I slept better after doing the exercises in this video. She also gives good breathing techniques and advice on how to handle pain. I definitely recommend this to those of you who want to exercise during pregnancy regardless of your fitness level."
1,A definite NO-NO for me,"I have done several prenatal classes prior to using this video. I enjoyed the classes a lot and they made me feel so good, so I want to do them at home (because it's cheaper and I can do them everyday).I tried this video, and the first time I used it, I felt slightly dizzy. The second time - I actually threw up. All that constant moving of the head makes one nauseous specially if you're pregnant. I'm already in my fourth month and I haven't had morning sickness, and since I'm in my second trimester, I don't expect to, but the movements in the video gave it to me. Also the poses are not so helpful; it's all constant moving and chanting, which is not really what I was looking for. I will try the other video which are better rated and hope that it will give me a more similar experience I had with my actual pre-natal classes."
2,Too much talking,"Overall, the exercises in the video are good. I enjoy the gentle stretching and moving, but she talks WAY TOO MUCH!!! It was fine the first few times I viewed the video, but hearing the same things over and over and over gets very annoying during future viewing. Now, I MUTE the TV and play a relaxing CD while doing the yoga exercises."
3,New-Age Flowing Yoga is Not for Everyone!,"I am seven and a half months pregnant, and I've been using this DVD since the start of my pregnancy. While I enjoy much of it (including the new-agey parts!), it is really best suited for those who enjoy a flowing, vinyasa or ashtanga style practice.I personally prefer hatha-style yoga, so this is not my favorite prental yoga DVD (see my review for ""Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea""). But overall, this DVD provides a nice way to relax and move around a bit in your pregnancy."
1,non-functioning dvd,"This DVD didn't play, either in my DVD player, or my computer. Returning it was a hassle, and I was still charged for shipping. These DVDs should really be tested at the factory, or wherever they are burned, to make sure they function properly!"
2,Earthy-Crunchy,"I bought this dvd because I had read an article about Gurmukh and some pre-natal postures she had suggested in Shape magazine. I've done yoga on and off for several years now and thought I'd really enjoy the workout. She talks during the ENTIRE dvd, there's no chance for you to just stretch and breathe by yourself b/c you can't tune out her voice. I bought both pre-and post-natal dvd's and now really wish I hadn't. I still do the workout twice a week (I'm 5 months along) and do find I enjoy the stretching, but it really is boring and for anyone who has done yoga before, you'll find there is very little actual yoga in the sequences. I take a live pre-natal yoga class once a week and we actually do more than sway and ""grind""."
5,Great Yoga video for relaxation and connection to baby..,"This video is really great. I am now 37 weeks pregnant and have used this video weekly throughout my pregnancy. It is not really for a hard workout. The instructor seems to be very spiritual and connects you with baby during the hr. I loved it because it is different. I felt I got the stretching that I needed and feel better about labor because of the time I spent doing this tape. I recommend anyone interested in a good stretching, relaxing yoga tape to use during your pregnancy, to buy this one! Well worth the money."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have done yoga with previous video tapes but was not sure what stretches I should and should not do once I became pregnant. That is why I bought this video specifically for moms to be. I should have known when the instructor appeared wearing a turban that this video was going to be ""out there"". I wanted structured stretching and relaxation. This video included foreign chanting and free style stretching. You are instructed to just let your body move freely to the music. I felt I was doing some kind of tribal dance. After my first viewing and attempt at participating, I immediately went for Amazon's return policy on videos. I was disappointed to learn that for videos, once opened, can not be returned. I think I will donate this one to the local library. My husband still comments on what a waste of money this purchase was."
1,"A long, tedius workout, better for those in very good shape","This workout takes nearly an hour, which is far too long for anyone who has other things going on in their life. Also, I find the postures pretty fatiguing. Instead of making me feel good, and relaxed and stretched, this video made me feel out of shape and sore. I didn't feel like the instructor really understood the challenges of moving and stretching when pregnant."
2,Very new-agey,"I got this as a gift from my yoga instructor and thought, ""It must be good if she recommends it."" WRONG! This is a very hokey video--lots of chanting, which I'm not all that into. I'd been doing yoga for about 2 years prior to becoming pregnant for a frame of reference. Half of the stuff you do during this video isn't really yoga at all. I'm currently looking for a new prenatal yoga video..."
2,WAY out there!,"I was interested in Gurmukh and her yoga style before getting pregnant, so this seemed like the perfect video to get for my prenatal workouts. I couldn't get through it even once! I found it boring, boring, boring! I'm guessing if you're a devotee of her style of yoga, the chanting, bongos and Gurmukh's breathy whispering might be enjoyable. I preferred Crunch's Yoga Mama by far. I found having a pregnant instructor was very helpful."
3,Interesting,I agree with many of the reviews. I don't do the chants and was glad that my husband missed this portion of the DVD! I find that fast forwarding the DVD past the chants is helpful. I enjoy the exercises and alternate this with a pilates DVD.
2,Too far out there for the non new ager,"The chanting was a bit much for me, as well as the visualization segments. They were too far out there for the average mom-to-be. In fact, my husband would laugh uncontrollably if he we to pass by the room during certain segments as they refer to a very primitive methods of birth. Definitely for the more new age/alternative life style group."
2,Chanting...not for me.,"I really wanted this DVD so that I could stretch and relax my back during my pregnancy. However, I could not get past the chanting. It is just not for me."
1,Laughter is best for relaxation,"This DVD is not very good for Yoga, but if you want to feel better though laughter pick it up. It doesn't take long to get a good giggle going and you'll feel better about yourself in less time than it takes to complete the DVD."
2,Helpful exercises drowned in silliness,"I was looking forward to a gentle challenge for my last month of pregnancy when I popped this video into the VCR (It was a hand-me-down tape from a friend). After losing my patience with the turban and muu-muu wearing instructor's long monologue that opens the tape I fast-forwarded until I saw the typical exercise-video setup.This was the beginning of the end for me. I resisted completely turning off the tape but couldn't help laughing as I watched some of the overly-enthusiastic participants writhing around while the instructor croons ""Your baaaaby loves to mooooove this waaaay."" It made me feel ridiculous.The reason I gave it two stars is that there are a few truly useful exercises that can be learned if you can ignore the instructor, participants, and music to get to them. If you're interested in trying this video, see if you can borrow it from the local library before you spend any money on it."
2,This one's not for me!,"I purchase this video hoping for a way to learn a little yoga and get some much needed deep stretching. I really was not into a more spiritual approach with chanting, etc.So, that said, this was just not for me. I watched it through before doing anything, as suggested. The music, chanting and tone of the instructor was a bit distracting, since I need a more direct approach to communication. I'm not a dancey kind of person, and that portion of the video was blah. I was also not always exactly sure of the correct positions, and since all of the women did it a little differently, they were more confusing than helpful. I did appreciate that all of the women were real-life people (read-normal).I have now ordered a tape that received great reviews and seems to be more what I would like. I wish I had checked out the reviews of this tape before purchasing, it would have saved a lot of money. Oh well, you live and learn!"
1,i thought it's yoga,not much yoga in this dvd!! So dissapointed. What's with all the other excercises?? If I buy something that says yoga on the front I expect it to be just that - YOGA!!
2,Good for beginners,"I found this video to be way to easy. I practiced yoga 5 days a week for an hour prior to getting pregnant, and was looking for a way to continue during my pregnancy. I didn't feel that I had gained any increased strength or flexability from this tape. The new age feel did not bother me much, but I did feel that the tribal dance moves were a bit silly. I would recommend this to a novice who is trying yoga for the first time."
2,WAY out there!,"I was interested in Gurmukh and her yoga style before getting pregnant, so this seemed like the perfect video to get for my prenatal workouts. I couldn't get through it even once! I found it boring, boring, boring! I'm guessing if you're a devotee of her style of yoga, the chanting, bongos and Gurmukh's breathy whispering might be enjoyable. I preferred Crunch's Yoga Mama by far."
1,Scary Towel Lady Yoga,"I'm going to have to give this DVD an F. I was looking for a yoga video that would provide a workout with some relaxing music, not some turban headed new age woman's opinion of what I should be doing while I was pregnant. I have used other yoga videos in the past, and I was so underwhelmed with this video that I only watched it once, and I'm sorry that I had my mother waste her money to purchase it. I would have returned it if I could, but the store would not allow it."
1,This loony tape isn't yoga!,"There is chanting (the instructor sounds like a banshee), dancing and flapping of the arms but not much real yoga.If you want to do prenatal yoga, try Crunch's 'Yoga Mama' or Living Arts' 'Prenatal Yoga.' I purchased them after buying (and laughing at) 'The Method' tape."
1,a waste of money,I totally agree with the previous reviewer. The singing/chanting was totally distracting and bizarre. And I didn't think the stretching and exercises were all that great. I expected a better workout rather than free-form belly-dancing.
3,Kooky,"I unfortunately left my curtains opened and was horrified to find the neighbors checking me out as I performed the exercises on this video. Definitely embarrassing considering some of the closed-eyed-dancing and the rocking-my-large-stomach swaying I was doing. The video is great to get your body moving, but I would not recommend it. Some of the exercises the teacher suggests doing go against my doctor's advice (the bridge). Plus, I just felt down right goofy doing some of the swaying around she suggested. I didn't find many traditional yoga poses in the practice at all. It was definitely a different experience that I'd just as soon not have again."
1,Definitely a NO-NO for me...,"I have done several prenatal classes prior to using this video. I enjoyed the classes a lot and they made me feel so good, so I want to do them at home (because it's cheaper and I can do them everyday).I tried this video, and the first time I used it, I felt slightly dizzy. The second time - I actually threw up. All that constant moving of the head makes one nauseous specially if you're pregnant. I'm already in my fourth month and I haven't had morning sickness, and since I'm in my second trimester, I don't expect to, but the movements in the video gave it to me. Also the poses are not so helpful; it's all constant moving and chanting, which is not really what I was looking for. I will try the other video which are better rated and hope that it will give me a more similar experience I had with my actual pre-natal classes."
2,Too bad you can't use the mute button,"I have no yoga experience, but did Pilates before my pregnancy. I found the exercises wonderful. They were a little challenging at first, and continued to feel good as I did them more. I skipped the chanting from the very beginning, and didn't mind listening to the leader at first. After just a few times, however, she started to really annoy me. She doesn't shut up the entire time! I found that very distracting. I'll still use the disk when I need an easy workout, but I don't really like it."
4,recommend for pregnant moms,I have thoughoughly enjoyed this yoga video. I do it once a week to keep me in tune with my pregnant body as well as my baby! I would not rely on it as my only yoga workout but it is a nice change. It's a video I will definently buy for other pregnant friends and family.
5,increases the bond between mommy and unborn child,"I didn't get this video until 2 months before my due date. Even then I didn't play it every day, but when I did I felt so much better. It helped me to forget the stress and totally relax and enjoy my pregnancy. I always felt very connected to my baby and this video gave me time to focus on just her. Everything was smooth and easy, nothing painful, but the stretches were invigorating and carefully focused on preparation for labor and delivery. I had a relatively quick and easy l&d and I believe the physical exercises combined with the encouraging messages in this video contributed to that. I enjoyed the peaceful tone of this video. The background music (played by live musicians) was soothing yet energetic enough to inspire movement. This video gave me many cherishable pregnancy memories and it also gave me the confidence I needed to remain calm and centered as the big day approached. I highly recommend it."
4,Great for labor prep,"Kinda silly looking as I guess it's ""look"" is quite outdated now. But this video is wonderful. It's very gentle and easy but felt great when I was 7 months and beyond during my pregnancy. I feel it's focus is much more towards preparing and opening a woman's body for birth rather than a typical yoga workout.Retrospectively, it was this video and all the yogic philosophy that goes along with it that allowed me to birth naturally."
2,Nothing like regular yoga,"This is an okay workout, and I enjoyed seeing the blissful and beatific looking pregnant women (especially since I haven't been feeling too blissful or beatific so far). But it's nothing like the hatha yoga I'm used to; hardly anything on this tape is recognizable to me as yoga, based on the yoga classes I've taken. And although I thought I'd enjoy the chanting (because I did enjoy it in a yoga class where we used to chant at the end), I actually found it silly and annoying. Plus, I found the instructor's silly-looking turban and ""zoned-out"" manner distracting.ZenMama with Rainbeau Mars: Prenatal Yoga Workoutis much less flaky and more like normal yoga, and is also good because it shows modifications for all three trimesters."
2,Maybe not for first trimesters....,"I've done lots of pilates and dance pre-pregnancy, but this is my first experience with yoga. I thought it would be a good, stretching, low-intensity workout, and it would--if it didn't make me nauseous every time. I haven't had much m/s overall, except when I try to do these moves! Too much rocking and circling. The chanting I found a little annoying (maybe it's just her voice), so I fast forward through that. I think I'll try to pick it up again when I'm feeling more sea-worthy!"
1,Couldn't get past the chanting,"Okay, maybe I was just unaware of what Yoga was, but I watched five minutes, the chanting bugged the heck out of me and I never put the tape in the VCR again. I finally gave the tape to Goodwill."
1,Worst video I have ever seen,I could not relax or meditate because the instructor talked throughout the entire video. She did not clearly explain the poses and the chanting was thoroughly disturbing...
3,A bit new-agey for my liking.....,"I began taking yoga after I became pregnant, and liked my prenatal yoga class in the area so much, that I thought I would buy a video so that I could enjoy the exercises at home too. However, I realized soon, that all yoga classes/instructors are not for me! This video is a bit too ""new-agey,"" and I found that the instructor talked way too much. I didnt find the tape relaxing, at all. Some of the stretching exercises were okay....."
4,Nice and relaxing prenatal yoga video,"This video is good for someone new to yoga. I'm pregnant and had to find something more soothing than step aerobics and spinning classes. This seems to be a good alternative, along with lots of walking and stationery bicycling. It's got a bit of chanting in the beginning and end, but nothing you can't fast forward through."
3,An decent workout but very new age,"This video provides a good paced stretching and strengthening workout for expectant moms. They use real pregnant women of varying shapes, sizes and flexability. Beware, the instructor is a little weird (wears a turban) and she leads off and closes with a lot of chanting and imagery, which can be distracting if you're not into that sort of stuff."
3,Don`t be fooled by a title!,"Let`s be very careful here: this is less a biography than a very well researched filmography. The title gives promise of ""Life and times of..."" but is thin on life and thin on time. But, frankly, if the title is inapropriate, this long filmography and analysis is worth it. Maybe I`ll try Zolotow for a real biography..."
5,Perhaps the best film biography ever written,"Billy Wilder is one of my favorite filmmakers, creator of three masterpieces: ""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Some Like It Hot."" Sikov does a remarkable job of giving us the life and mind of the man. Show people rival Southerners in their refusal to let the trivia of facts get in the way of a good story, and Wilder was a storyteller among storytellers. Most film bios are hopelessly gullible, but Sikov uses the interviews that Wilder gave throughout his career--the man would say virtually anything--to give us his full flavor, always careful to show where the facts and stories diverge, but without spoiling our pleasure in those stories. The result is the best film biography I've yet read, well-versed in the business, politics and psychology of filmmaking. And because the subject is Wilder, it is also one of the funniest books I've come across in a long, long time."
5,Love Corelle,"I have used Corelle Ware for years and this purchase seems to be just like the others, great. I expect it to meet my expectations of quality and service."
1,Buyer beware! Price is for only one plate!,"The price is just for ONE plate, which is way too expensive for Corelle. One of the reviews says that she received a four-pack of plates, but this is only for one. I returned it."
1,Listing error makes you spend $11.99 instead of $3,"Like the other reviewer mentioned earlier, be SUPER careful when ordering. Each plate should cost between $2 and $3 dollars (check other vendors not affiliated with Amazon!) and NOT $11.99. When Amazon itself fills this order, they COUNT each individual plate and sell it to you at $11.99. I don't know if this is a warehouse error or standard policy, but I am returning the 4 plates I got for a refund. (I adore these winter frost plates, but customers need to be made aware of this issue. I hope Amazon can correct this soon)"
2,Plates are great.. but be careful of buying from Amazon.,"My husband bought me these plates for Christmas and I love them. They are perfect for downsizing your portions!Now, about Amazon and these plates. We read the other reviews about them not listing them properly or sending the right number of plates. So, we very carefully read the description. These are usually sold in lots of 6 and the weight of the product is 4 pounds leading you to believe that all 6 plates are in the box. The price also indicates multiple plates in the box... who would pay $24 for one Corelle plate? Guess what... we got 1 plate in a box! Needless to say, they went back and we ordered from another supplier. Amazon gave us no hassles, but really, after all the bad press you'd think they would fix it! I just checked and they seem to have stopped selling them in house.Best of luck and try the Ace Hardware link. They shipped quickly and we got all the plates we ordered."
3,outrageous study of ego and arrogance,outrageous study of ego and arrogance. Who really cares what italian men think about women? i think american males are sexier and more sensitive at the same time!
5,enjoy his music,if you enjoy his music you'll most likely enjoy the c.d. some of the songs are hard to find so i bought the c.d. not regrets here.
4,AWESOME TECHNO SERIES EVER!!!!,"I have loved techno a lot but when I went to Mexico and I heard this series, I was hooked! I bought this album and every song makes you dance and is awesome. Has huge hits from Camisra, DJ Jean and this one guy named Zycro? Hey, I remember that song when I played it, I heard it at a hotel in Cancun and that's awesome. In my words, buy this album or keep on goin with the series but do not buy the Wild Nights but if you like them then that's ok. There not my favorites. My other advice:If your a huge DJ and ya gotta get some good techno music, buy Wild Vol. 8 and if your not a DJ, then keep on dancing with these club classics for forever."
5,The Five at their best...,"This DVD is a great purchase for pretty much anyone who appreciates Ben Folds Five's music. Whether you be an avid fan or someone who just likes a couple of their/his songs.The DVD is a colaboration of their best works from the 1st 2 albums (Ben Folds Five, Whatever And Ever Amen) played in a small studio with an intimate and enthusiastic audience.With Ben Fold's smooth lead vocals and awe inspoiring piano, the amazing harmonies from Darren Jesse and Robert Sledge coming over so perfectly in this live recording - you feel as though you are there watching live. It makes you wonder why they ever broke up!This DVD is a must have in anyones collection."
5,Amazing,"I recently purchased this Dvd, and it is absolutly astounding. I think i've watched it at leaste three times. All the songs are wonderful. Ben Folds ""Missing the war"" nearly gave me goosebumps. You might have to be a true Ben fan to fully enjoy this dvd. Seeing this just gave me a greater appriciation of Ben Folds voice, paino, and amazin song writing ability."
1,Get Ben Folds Live instead,"I bought this DVD on the strength of the new 2002 Ben Folds Live CD/DVD (Ben solo). West 54th was made in 1996 I believe, and all I can say is what a difference 6 years make! On W 54th Street Ben seems tentative with his keyboard playing and is somewhat nervouse throughout. He also is constantly looking at his bandmates to cue them as if they have not rehearsed enough. On BFL, he's awesome.. totally in control and displays his keyboard talent to such a greater degree. On W 54th street on a few of the tunes they try to do a hip hop/ rap beat which just falls flat. I know many fans would disagree, but BF did the right thing in firing the band."
4,"Great band, not so great mix","I'm a big BFF fan and have seen them in concert. The ""sessions"" part of this DVD has the same problem their live show did: the drums and fuzz bass, while terrific, often overwhelm the fantastic music and consummate skill pouring out of Ben's piano. This was a huge disappointment, but I still strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes BFF. Amazingly, some of the bonus track concert versions have much better mixes even though the recordings must have been made under dramatically less controlled conditions. The only other complaint was that I wish they had performed some of the songs with more variation from the album versions. Sometimes it sounds like you are listening to a bad mix of the same version you've heard before on the album. However, given that they have broken up and this may be your only chance to see a ""live"" show, buy it!"
5,In their prime,"This is the best band dvd I own. Really good performance, especially if you like Ben Folds Five. If only these guys would have continued making good music, and Ben didn't go lose it and start writing music that sounds like it should be on cereal commercials. This is definitely Ben Folds Five in their prime."
5,excellent video quality,"Excellent show. Didn't notice any sound delay as in another review. It is definitely like seeing him live. In fact, I did see him live soon after watching this dvd and he didn't dissapoint, but I was a little worried that he wouldn't live up to this performance. It is a must have if you are a fan.This disc has the best dvd video transfer quality I've seen so far. You have to really search for any compression artifacts, which are common on most dvd's and easy to see on big screen tv's (even hdtv ready)."
2,Where's Maxi?,"After listening to and finally realizing it is MUZAK and not MUSIC, I was a little bothered but listened to it anyway. The Maxi Priest song on here has no words except the chorus and done by the back up singers, no Maxi at all anywhere on here. So I was a little disappointed."
1,Gross,"This stuff was so gross. It was like wax, that didn't come off anything it came in contact with. Unless you don't mind grease/wax don't buy."
5,My hair looks stylish now!,"After using gel and wax for more than 18 years, finally, I have found Murray's pomade are the most suitable product for my hair. I can comb my hair easily and nicely now. Thank you very much. It's worth buying!"
4,murrays pomade,"I give it 4 stars because it can be hard to brush your hair with this in. It has great hold and I have found the best way to apply is to put glob on brush and run hair dryer for about 20 seconds. I like to put royal crown hair dressing on top for a slick look. U also dont need to put on every day so lasts long. I have tried sauvecito, axe and other water based products but keep going back to the old school products."
3,Good Price,"It was good for how much I paid for it. Only paid like 3 dollars for it. It didnt hold my hair in place like I wanted it to, but you cant complain for the price."
2,Smells bad and is impossible to get out of hair,"I really don't understand why anyone could endorse this. Not only does it smell bad, but it's next to impossible to wash out without using massive amounts of dish soap.No thanks."
2,It's Just So Hard,I haven't even used it yet because i can't scoop it or slide my hands through it at all. I hope it's worth it or I might just give it to someone.
3,Murray's pomade,"It's unexpectedly thick and a little hard to apply, but no issues with hold, this stuff can hold your hair in place during a hurricane. It's a little had to wash out, waxy, but I guess you have to expect that. I was looking for something that's a little softer and easier to apply, but this is my fist try so I'll keep looking.For what it is, not a bad product, just not exactly what I was looking for so I can't hold that against the product. One of the cons of buying online I suppose."
5,Great hair product,"The smell and hold are fantastic. For me the hair product is good for my hair when it is shorter, when it gets longer it's harder to apply, maybe doing it wrong... I have actually started to prefer this over American Crew since Murray's makes my hair look fuller too."
4,Nice,"I like this watch a lot. The only thing is the fact I wished it looks more professional, and a bit pricey. I used the alarm feature, and it works like a charm. The vibration is not to wake you up...but it will remind you for a meeting, or how long you have been working on something? You do have to be careful though as it is easy to turn the alarm. I think the reason is to make it easy to turn it off.Good buy for sure."
3,Alarm for Meds,"I previously had a wristwatch that alarmed to alert me that it was time to take an important medication. I wanted one that was silent and vibrated and that's what this watch does. Unfortunately it is very large and I have a small wrist, so it is just too large for me to wear. It is very functional, however."
3,Nice individual size,"I really like the small individual size of this. My husband and I open a bottle of wine, pour half in his carafe and half in mine. Now I can take as long as I want to sip my wine (while his is gone in minutes :-)Only negative is the lip of the bottle is thick and it always drips after a pour."
3,Color is not bronze!,"Chandelier looks bronze on line - it's definitely black! Nice looking light, but wrong color for me. I would recommend if black is what you need."
1,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with the music. I don't like the film that much, but the music is actually must worse. The songs have nothing special, and the music-making is of mediocre quality. Although it may not be appropriate to look for something that is very innovative in the music composed for a cartoon movie, such dull music is still very unsatisfactory, especially when released in soundtrack format for independent appreciation.I wouldn't recommend it to others."
1,The Party Cd Stinks!,I have not listened to the soundtrack cd yet but I have the party cd that came with my dvd. It is supposed to have 6 Kareoke songs on it and the words are supposed to show up when you play it in your kareoke machine compatible with the CDG. Well I have tried it several times as well as in other kareoke machines and it does not work. I am very disappointed in this cd.
2,Nothing very special,This is a very so-so release. Nothing special about the songs. Rather bland musically.
1,Much over-rated,This soundtrack has been very much over-rated. There is absolutely nothing new that the music can offer. It's just a repeat of some well tested and tried formulae with almost no intention to bring the listener something new. I found most of the songs staid and uninvolving. I don't like them at all!
5,Shrek 2,This is a awesome soundtrack. it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
4,Really worth listening,"I've been a loyal fan of movies soundtrack and I find ""holding out for a hero-bonus soundtrack"" really worth listening. Besides, you might like to try ""accidentally in love"", a sweet song, and ""fairy godmother song"", kinda ""be our guest"" in beauty and the beast. Those beautiful songs do make a good CD, I suppose."
3,Let's Hope This Brings a Nice Paycheck To....,"Hats off to whoever selected these tracks and managed to slip in tunes by true artists such as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Tom Waits, the Eels, and Steve Shelley (via Pete Yorn's cover of ""Ever Fallen in Love""). May they receive nice royalty checks into the forseeable future to continue their own great work."
5,A book to read more than once,"I really enjoyed this book. While not quite as immediately riveting, such as the case with Beggars in Spain, this book gradually drew me in. After reading it a second time, I found an even richer story. I think I've read this book four times now over the past six years and have enjoyed it each time. I find it amazing how Nancy Kress is able to create these true to life characters in situations that she creates and makes real."
4,Well Done Anthology,"A tip of the cap to editor Monte Dutton and the group of writers who put this together.This is a quick easy-read with no ""heavy lifting"".I especially enjoyed reading about the defunct race tracks (Wilkesboro,Columbia) and what they meant to the drivers,owners,crews and fans.The stories about Adam Petty and Davey Allison are especially poignant.Lots of good stuff here.Well done gentlemen."
3,full of wrong answers,"The textbook is good, but despite so many editions is full of mistakes (mainly the statistical exercises). For the price you would expect this book to be perfect."
5,Awesome and refreshing musical talent...,"I've been listening to Bugs in Amber for a few years since their first album, Trafalmadorian (sp?) Philosophy and I can honestly say that this is a great band. I even hung out with the members of the band one great summer a couple summers back. They have refreshing musical talent and Sonny's lyrics are nothing short of genius. Friend or Foe has been a favorite song in my arsenal since their self released EP Friend or Foe, but I was pleased to hear that the other songs have taken on even more depth and beauty. The dynamic of the whole band together and the individual sounds of seven different musical instruments is magical. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Radiohead, Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, and my favorite, Smashing Pumpkins. Try it out...you won't be disappointed! You can see more about them on bugsinamber.com if you're interested."
2,Broke after a few months.,I loved this blender for the time it worked. I probably used it for about 18 months. I made weekly smoothies with fruits and ice and washed the jar in the dishwasher. It worked really well.The plastic base of the jar broke today and I can either find a replacement part which will cost about $30 or find a better blender that is more solid... And I thought I would have that blender for 10 years!
3,"Love them, but need more adhesive","I love these things and have been using them everywhere we go out to eat with my son. However, it has been a constant fight to keep him from pulling them off, ever since he was about 6 months old (he's now a year).I find it best to tape the bottom edge down under the table, then pull very taut before sticking the top edge down. That seems to keep it on for an extra couple of minutes. ;) The rest of the time, I usually have to keep my hand pressed down on it to keep my son from tearing it off."
5,CALIENTE,"THIS CD IS SO HOT, YOU WILL NOT STOP DANCING TO IT EVERY CUT ON THIS CD VERY MOVING YOU CAN NOT SIT STILL."
5,High Level of Musical Sophistication,"If you love salsa rythm with more musical sophistication and jazz orientation that the average salsa you hear in clubs, this CD is for you. Frankly I can't believe my ears. They sound like they're Cuban, which is the highest compliment I can give."
4,modernized mambo style salsa with good flavor,"El disco esta bueno, pero yo pienso que muchos de los reviewers de amazon estan exagerando cuan buena es esta banda.El estilo de salsa que toca Salsa Picante es muy feliz y las canciones son bastante largas con buenas partes para los differentes instrumentos. Esto le da al disco una increible disposicion para el baile.Los metales tocan melodias en un estilo que recuerda a maestros del pasado como Tito Puente, y al fin al cabo terminan sonando como si los metieron en una maquina del tiempo en 1970 y salieron en el an~o 2000.Otra cosa que me gusto es que en estos dias de tantos grupos copiando exitos del pasado(spanish harlem orquestra, sonora carruseles, y miami's band), las canciones en este disco son originales."
1,Dont buy this mattress,"Don't buy this mattress. Had it less than a year, the air tubes inside separted and it become lopsided, and unusable. It is also difficult to get off, it tilts to one side."
2,Buy Intex but a different model.,"This is a great company but this particular model is a very poor design. the bottom in NOT flat. The bottom has an outer ridge all the way around that is 8 inches wide and is 3 to 4 inches in depth which makes the center portion of the bottom hollow. This makes the mattress feel like one of those old antique mattresses you see in the old movies where the people, especially two people, roll to the middle of the mattress. If they make one that has a flat bottom I would buy that model. Everything else about the mattress is very nice."
4,comfy bed,"Easy to set up and keep inflated. Also keeps sheets on without sliding off. As with all Air Beds I've slept on, needs extra layer between you and bed to keep from feeling as if your laying on the cold."
5,Great Finale,"I have watched this show since episode one, season one and have loved every season since... I love this set, great ending to it all!!! Hopefully they come out with a movie!!!"
5,Great picture,Wife watched all episodes and loved them all. Terrific video quality. Convenient to watch anytime in her room while I work outside.
5,A really great show.,"When I realized that season 5 was available before the actual season on tv began, I had to have it. It's so hard to believe that a great show is coming to a end."
4,A Little Disappointed,"The first three seasons of Friday Night Lights were GREAT (candidates for the best ever on tv). The 4th season slipped from that level and the 5th season slipped even more. So, OK to watch to complete the series, but not nearly the same quality and so very similar to many many tv series."
1,Ripped off!,"I purchased the season from Amazon. When I got to the final disc, It was dmaged the last CD although the image worked the sound did not."
5,Breaking Corelle,"I give Corelle 5 stars. They are hard to break. That being said, if you DO break Corelle, it turns into thousands of needle and razor like shards that are really dangerous. I buy, use and recommend Corelle, but just be careful around the breakage if you do break a piece."
5,Love these plates,"These are really nice plates. They have a classic beauty and simplicity, but at the same time a modern look...and the best quality: resistance. They are unbelievably strong and last forever. And you can never go wrong with simple white...you can combine them with different color table cloths, and colorful glasses. Plus, they are extremely cheap but with a quality worth lots of dollars."
5,Corelle is the BEST,"I used Corelle for years and then decided to 'grow up' and get stoneware. First, stoneware is heavy without anything on it! Put it in the microwave and it gets too hot to handle without serious hot pads or gloves! The stoneware is now at the thrift store and I'm back to Corelle! Love the winter white frost as it is so versatile. Love the open stock pieces as well as I never use the cups or mugs that come with a 'set'."
3,So-so,Was looking for everyday china and didn't expect them to be so thin. The picture looks more substantial to me.
3,It's a plate:),"It is a plate, food can sit on it, it works.Nothing more to say about the item but you have to have so many words in review:("
3,"A little bit of this, a little bit of that","Granted, some of the instruction is uninspired and done better in one of the countless other drawing books on the market. But each of the contributing authors gives a quick run-down of some pretty solid techniques for general drawing practice.Think of it as a ""Greatest Hits Sampler"" of drawing books."
1,A waste of money and time,"To begin with the instructor did not even have a baby with her. You are suppose to do yoga with your baby next to you for the most part. You are to perform the postitions around your baby. When I went from the triangle to the cobra, my baby grabbed my hair. When I lifted her overhead, she drooled on me. When I rocked on my back with her between my legs, I almost bonked her. At the end you are suppose to walk around the room holding your baby. I can do that while I do housework. This video is goofy."
1,A Waste of Money,"What a waste of money! The introduction was a waste of time to listen to and it didn't get any better after that. I thought I could do some Yoga with my baby, but that was only for a couple of minutes. My baby was lying down most of the time, like all the babies in the video, since there wasn't much techniques to incorporate them. I can't stand the instructor's voice, which sounded like a nagging tone. The session ends with everybody holding their babies and moving around and she calls it dancing!"
3,Buy with caution,"This series by Ms G Khalsa has its place. While the production is well presented I would not recommend it for anyone who had not been doing yoga for a long time, in otherwords a seasoned yogi. There is a lot of chanting, visualisation and a really new age/ esoteric feel to this DVD. While I have done yoga in various styles and with various teachers, I found this DVD patronising and over the top. I feel I wasted my money buying this product. What I would recommend is Lisa Hart's Fit Mamma. Now there is a routine that you want to get up for and Ms Hart is 8mths pregnant while she presents it and is a breath of fresh air. I use Ms Hart's DVD three times a week"
1,Not Great Yoga,I am sure if you just want a pregnancy or post natal workout that these are fine. I personally LOVE my yoga practice and found these videos deffinitely wanting. They have some nice qualities but really I was unhappy. I prefer Gaiam's videos.
5,loved the workout but Gurmukh IS a new age nut,"This is a fabulous post-baby workout and, unlike some of the others reviewing this, I can honestly say my son LOVES to do yoga with me. It may help that we started at less than 1 month old, but at 14 mos, he can do ""downward dog"" with the best of them!!Gurmukh is a complete new age crunch, and has some annoying habits - like only addressing women in her class who have non-Western names (I know there is a Kate on the credits but it is PruPaul who is spoken to) - but she does know her stuff. I choose to find it amusing and use it to have more fun with my son during my workouts. She has also intrigued me with Kundalini yoga (I have previously only done Astanga) and, lord help me, I think I am going to get another of her videos!!"
3,baby and mom post natal yoga,It was a very short work out. By the time i started to get into it it was over
2,Baby & Mom Postnatal Yoga,"A little slow to take off, the instructor's voice is boring and a little creepy. Would have liked a little more exercise interaction with the baby. Wasn't very unique or interesting. Very basic obvious routines, great for the beginner."
1,please give ME something jagged...,"Listening to this CD is the worst torture I can envision for anyone (unless, of course, you were actually stuck in an elevator with this CD playing.) I can't believe that anyone who appreciates Morrisette's music could think this would work."
1,Abysmal,"I read a review of this CD and thought it HAD to be a bad joke, so I checked it out for myself. Holy smoke...this IS a real CD! This is the worst release since ""Hooked on Classics""! It is TORTURE to sit through."
1,Are you freakin' kiddin' me??,"This is worse than Muzak. Honestly, what's next, the London Phil plays Eminem?It's well played, for what it's worth"
3,"Interesting, to say the least","Alanis Morissette's songs just don't suit the style of a string quartet, though the makers of this album pulled it off fairly well. Songs like ""Perfect"", ""Forgiven"" and ""Mary Jane"" work well with the string arrangements, but ""All I Really Want"", ""Hand in my Pocket"" and ""Ironic"" are just hilarious. If you're a die hard Alanis fan, this is a must. All others avoid!"
1,not meant to be,"After hearing this cd i've learned that alanis morissette's songs are not meant to be played with a quartet of strings. I'm not sure if it was a bad arrangement or what but it did not sound very good, and now i wish i hadn't bought the album. With the money i wasted on this cd i could've bought a cd of a REAL composer."
2,wrong part!,"The part arrived quickly - that was great, since we're talking about our daily driver. But, it was the wrong starter - didn't fit our vehicle. In other words, it was NOT as advertised - that was NOT great, because we're talking about our daily driver! However, returns were easy, and free, and that WAS great. So, customer was service was ALMOST consistently outstanding."
1,Charges Only,"The first time I used this it worked perfectly. Plugged it in and put the phone in the cradle and it started charging and synchroized perfectly. Since then however it has only worked as a charger. To get it to synchronize is very hit or miss - if you dock the phone and hold it it at the right angle steadily for a few minutes, if the wind is blowing the right way, and the stars are aligned correctly etc. etc. it may sync ok. I've found slipping a couple of business cards behind the phone in the cradle sometimes allows it to stay connected properly so it can sync.But it does work fine as a desktop charger and the charging of the spare battery is a good feature for those of us on the go all day who need the back-up battery handy so it gets a star for that."
1,would not recommend,this piece of equipment is not worth a dam. It broke on me and stop charging both my battery and my phone at the same time. i spent a little bit more money and bought the one from palm. Ive had it for around 7 months and have had no problems what so ever.
1,Waste of money,"Waste of money, do not buy this product. The charger is really bad, after a couple of week, it fall from my bed to the floor and it will no work, the height was 30 in, really bad product! Dont waste your money..."
4,Very thorough and comprehensive guide,"This book covers just about every facet of tcp/ip in a comprehensive fashion. Every protocol is covered separately and well illustrated. My only criticism so far is that I still have trouble understanding subnet masks, due to this book not actually giving an example other than the default 255.255.255.0 etc. - a trap that every networking book I have read seems to fall into (although that may say more about me than the book!). Definitely worth purchasing for its authoritative feel - I'm sure you could trust it implicitly - though maybe a tad heavy-going for the beginner. Only misses out on 5 stars because I'm still confused about the point I mentioned and I might need another book to help me yet..."
2,high and low leveles mixed together,"The book is thorough, but we have RFCs for that ... The author keeps flooding the reader with details (e.g. port numbers, sizes, addresses) even when trying to explain principals. There should be better seperation between high level concepts and implementation details that does not exist in this book (and does in other books). Also, a lot of the diagrams are meaningless, and it seemed to me a lot of the times they were here only to make the book thicker. Most of the examples are trace of packets, which are difficult to follow. High level flow examples are missing."
5,TCP/IP for the Advanced Professional,"This book has been my ultimate reference for TCP/IP for the past several years, and is very comprehensive. It is about as complete as can be expected given the publication date. However, it is not a book for beginners in any way shape or form. If analyzing TCP/IP is your business, or you need a good desk reference for TCP/IP, then I would highly recommend this book. I only wish more books were written with this level of detail."
4,"Engaging,1st hand account. Inspiring, but infuriating too.","""Capt. Howard Rutledge,11-27-65"" was the POW/MIA name engraved on a bracelet I acquired in 6th or 7th grade (~1972). A grass roots organization distributed bracelets with the name of missing servicemen. The idea was to wear the bracelet until the missing were returned. To my great joy, Capt Rutledge returned and wrote a very inspiring account of the hell he and others lived through and the spriritual toughness and comradeship that got them through it. I immediately read the book when it first came out. As an 8th grader it had a huge impact on me. The book disappeared after being loaned out to friends. I retain the bracelet and an undiminished bank of gratitude to Capt. Rutledge and all other veterans. The depth of faith and cunning of the prisoners and the brutality of their captors is amazing. This is an excellent book about the POW experience and the true meaning of honor and a military Officer."
3,Difficult to follow,"The illustrations are simple but difficult to follow. Pictures are in black and white so I was unable to get a sense of color patterns. It does however, provide how to information for the largest selection of designs and beading styles of any book I have. It is an older edition than most beading books and I like that. This book would probably be more useful to an intermediate beader than a beginner."
2,Only buy it if...,...You like any book on the subject of beading. It really left me cold. I'll just put in my stash of books but will probably never use it as a reference guide on beading techniques.
3,The Price does not Justify the Return,"While I'm sure at the time of this conference, the works in this book were a bit more groundbreaking, there is little in the book that is outside the realm of modern mathematical models of symmetry and symmetry breaking.It is fantastic, mind you. And it's nice to read some of these authors in their own 'speech' - for it is obvious that many of the papers collected were delivered to a crowd as part of a presentation. Therefore much of this collection is a messy copy of many unedited (spelling/sentence errors) and hand written notes.It's great. But, I don't know that there is any work from this conference that was not published later, and, since that is the case, much of this is really available for free on-line at this point. There are some nice hand written black& white pictures by Penrose, but... for $70-100 dollars?I wouldn't recommend this for an Escher fan, certainly, and only the most die-hard of math fans."
4,OK but not for new boarns,Nice halter but not for new borns - especially not Arabians. Perhaps OK for 6mos. Very little adjustment on nose.
4,Excellent account.,"This is a beautiful display book to have hanging around your house, something you are likely to pick up any time. It is a good short history and account of the tea trade, and the descrition and history of the ships is very detailed. For anyone with a love of these, the most beautiful ships ever built, this book is a must have!"
1,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed in this book. I expected organized, topical information that young people can use when starting out in life: how to find an apartment, keep a budget, understand credit, get along with roommates, find and maintain a car or use other transportation, etc. Instead, it's a lot of one-liner sayings, proverbs, declarations, and simplistic advice - one sentence per page. I'm sure the author means well, but this is something a parent might staple together for his or her child - it's not of general interest or use."
3,Way to much micromanaging,"For my taste there is too much to micromanage. The game play, graphics etc are very good however. Also, as others have said, this game is mainly for multiplayer online play. In the campaigns, The AI is fairly robust. If you like to micromanage everything I think you will like this game, if not I'd pass. I prefer Company of Heroes."
3,Faces of War ?? Men of War??,Just by looking at the screen shots of the game its men of war but its not but it is??? Anyway overall its a good game if you like company of heroes with alot more micro managing. Controls are good except for some AI issues when your troops decide to take on a tank by themselves or charge at a mg nest...Ahh no!! what are you doing...Men of War this years Faces of War takes care of a couple of those flaws...Graphics are good not overally impressive though..Sound effects are well done except for the repetitive voice overs...all in all a nice pick up for 10 bucks...
5,Understanding SNCC and Freedom Summer,"This is a valuable specialized book for understanding what it was like to be part of the SNCC/COFO volunteers (especially the northern white Freedom School teachers) and the people of Mississippi with whom they lived and worked in the summer of 1964. It gives a rich sense of who those people were then and what they became in later years. It also gives a good feel for what was and wasn't changed by that famous summer project. It's also a good book for anyone who's thinking about creating a politically inclined grass roots school from scratch. It's honest, well observed, practical in many ways. A good historical reading for anyone interested in grass roots community work in general. Also a good reflection piece for people who want to think about what education's all about. If you have a personal connection to that summer project that you still cherish, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this book."
2,simply a load of facts,"While I think that this book has true potential, I find that it lacks pertinent background information, and reads like a listing of ""who, what, when, where"" facts. While the author makes connections between gangsters and mafia families, I find myself thinking, ""who cares?"" Instead of developing the lives of the notorious mafioso, he simply presents the reader with a synopsis of their deaths in most cases. Lots of information. Not very interesting non-fiction."
5,Gangster City,"I loved this book! Their are many reasons, but the main reason is I found the author to be investgative as well as just telling stories about gangsters. He doesnt give you the usual already told before versions that some other authers do by quoting other books. He actually questions them and gives credible and rational reasons. For example, it is widely known that Lucky Luciano set up Joe Masseria in a Coney Island restaurant by going to the mens room when Joe the boss was killed. The author raises valid questions and refers to newspapers of the time and no newspapers report that Lucky was even there! He even questioned the hit team and driver(Ciro Terranova) If you are a Gangster book reader then you must read this book! I found the lesser known gangster for which the author was trying to tell about fasinating! I found myself wanting to go to the NYC municipal archives myself to see some of the pictures he put in the book."
4,Gangster City,"A very enjoyable book, and long overdue. Anyone interested in the evolution of the New York City underworld during the first part of the twentieth century will find it a pretty good read, fast-paced, accurate, and full of little-known facts about the local hoodlum community. While it does not quite rate a five star review in my humble opinion, it is still highly recommended."
1,You're being deceived,"For any Christians out there, remember, the Man of Sin, the Lawless one, the Son of Perdition, the Beast, the Antichrist will come before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.I'm not at all convinced Maitreya is Jesus Christ's second coming, in fact if you dig into the New Age religion, staring with Helena Blavatsky, you'll realize it is centered around the worship of the fallen angel, Lucifer aka Satan.Be careful what you read and what you believe."
2,One Truth,"I AM A Master and theres a million potential masters each day. Theres only one TRUTH, yet many books, many opportunities to look outside one self for something you already have within the center of your very being.Use your mind heart and body. You either use this one truth to serve this one higher self but some will use this knowledge to manipulate others in serving thier own personal agenda. NO FEAR..for what you think of as God IS already everywhere and its beautiful source and articulation has to be realized within your own story. Every word idea and thought has already been done, accomplished waiting for you to ask and you shall recieve. Christ means no limitation, infinite supply, abundance of love..heaven is here and now..how long will it take?...how many leaders do you call?...the infinite mind knows no size..you are one...."
3,Thought provoking. Open minds are rewarded.,Mr. Creme sets forth a number of concepts which were new to me at the time of reading. I found myself extremely sceptical but unable to toss it aside as having no value. I have re-read it from time to time since the first reading a number of years ago and still find it fascinating and much more believable.
2,Review of Reappearance of the Christ by B. Creme,A bit of a much ado about nothing - the book is largely a rehash of earlier publications in the Alice Bailey series which are mindblowing!! Nonetheless basic ideas are clearly presented.
3,Children of the Lion completion,"the book was a bit more worn than expected, but this was the completion to a set of books I had purchased years ago. Somehow I missed this book when it came out. The whole serise was very good overall for someone that likes historical fiction especially related to the time of the events of the old testiment Bible."
4,UConn Husky baseball floor matt,Baseball floor matt arrived quickly and in good condition. Looks great in my son's room. Took a few days to lie flat.
1,Tiffany print,"While the paper is the size mentioned, the actual print is much smaller within the borders of the paper than I thought. I had hoped that the actual print would have been the 11 x 14 - but it's smaller. Wouldn't order anything like this again."
4,Nice!,I'm surprised nobody mentioned the track Below. How sick is the solo on there? SICK! I would by it again just for that one track and every time I listen to it in the gym or in one of my vehicles it makes want to find a small child to punch in the face! Sure that's pretty messed up but that's how much the song destroys lives.
3,Why does Grave even bother anymore ?,"This 2 CD release had potential, but the album goes no where. Grave have not released a good CD since Soulless, and I find that album a little too tame for what Grave once was. The only good part about this release, is the 2nd bonus disc containing their early Demos. Put simply, the demo disc is the only reason to buy this release.Grave's new album As Rapture Comes will be out later this year (2006). From what Ive heard of the album (which is the entire album), its not anything to rave about either.REVISION: I must admit that while Grave's recent studio works are not my taste, their live shows are damn good. Support death metal."
5,One to share with a friend,"I almost passed this one by. I love historical romance and I thought this might be too frivolous. Boy was I wrong! Ms. Wynn was able to tell a delightful tale about a female elf trying to seduce a human male to win a dare by her elfin brother. Well known for their beauty, this elfin maid embarks on this adventure, certain that she will win the man's heart, but unaware that she will lose her own. The characters are well developed(and surprisingly believable!) and the story line is very interesting, yet it is a quick-read just right for the holidays. What could have been a silly story is in fact a heartwarming tale full of humour, adventure and romance. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, entertaining tale."
4,Surprisingly good hard rocker from Canada,"I remember hearing ""Wild Eyes"" years ago on CKLW out of Detroit. I also remember being shocked that it was by the Stampeders, a country rock band known for their huge hit ""Sweet City Woman"" This album is more of a hard rocker, with some excellent singing and guitar playing. Highlights are the B.T.O-like ""Wild Eyes"", the thundering ""Ramona"" and the hard southern rock of ""It's Your Move"". Capitol released the album back in 1974, and it was out of print a short time later. Even the mellow tunes are tasteful and well-done. Excellent production makes this a lost semi-classic."
5,Book review,Excellent product condition! No problems with seller - very straightforward purchase and will buy again!!
1,False Advertising,"The seller said this book was 99% great condition. However, it was so poorly wrapped, that when I rceived it, 3 of the 4 outer corners of the book (hard cover) were blown out. Also, there was a great deal of highlighting. Like I said before, this was completely false advertising, and I will think twice before purchasing from Amazon."
1,Very disappointed,"I had to read this textbook for a mid-level psych course and was very disappointed. Not only is there a lot of ""fluff"", but the author frequently presents the results of studies in such simplified terms, that it would be easy to draw the wrong conclusions (and conclusions which might be sexist, racist, classist, etc) from the information. There are also little ""observation quizzes"" and ""things to think about"" listed in the margins which were so subjective or irrelevant that I found them insulting. My favorite was a comment on breastfeeding, when the author suggested it was a good idea because it was less stressful on fathers, especially at night! I had to look back at the cover of my book to double-check that it was really written by a woman! That's just one example among many that I found very insulting in the book. I can't believe anyone still really thinks that way in this day and age!"
5,Detective Van Veeteren,We have enjoyed all of the Detective Van Veeteren episodes available on the market! We wish that there were more!
4,pastry board,"absolutely perfect board for any pastry, bread, or flatbread uses. good weight and perfect included marble rolling pin."
3,Not sure....hmmmm,"I just got done reading this very long-winded tale of ""who-done-it"" and I have to say this is one of those books that you really have to stick with in order to get into it. This is the first time that I have read this author, and I am not sure the presentation of this novel and the way that it was written, that I would jump for joy to read his material again...very slow moving story, with very little action...what does this novel have going for it?? I do like the way that the author ended everything on an even keel...I enjoyed how he took one character (Frances, main character's mother) and made her realize she had made some major mistakes in her life, and was now turning her life around.This is not a bad book by any means, but if you are looking for a story that has lots of non-stop action, that leaves you on the edge of your seat...this is not the story for you! As I soon found out!!!! :)"
5,Best paper!,I create professional art prints and I have been using Epson heavyweight matte paper since 2005. The prints from 2005 still look as good as the day they were created. Colors always come out true and the quality is superb. I use this paper in my Epson Stylus Photo 1280.
2,compressed disc plays at too fast a speed,"great to have lone on dvd at all but this dvd is obviously compressed to some degree because everything moves unnaturally fast. lone speaks too fast. it's not you're not getting the real show. it's compressed at a rate of 130% or something. the episodes open with the full song, the middle ones open with like an abbreviated opening (which is ok because we watch more than one) and don't close with the ending song until the end of the disc so that the episodes average out to 23.5 minutes each so i am thinking for a show from back then it has to be sped up so they could fit more eps on a disc. don't know what disc is better yet, really. the one from cracker barrel i think i remember might be better. the hopalong cassidy volumes don't seem to be so bad. anybody know of a better not compressed lone ranger disc than this one? will post to a discussion on here when i get a chance."
2,misrepresented,"This is another one of those DVDs that doesn't live up to expectations. It has no credits, each episode runs after the first - it's as if they are from a Saturday morning matinee at the theatre.The reviews made it sound like it contains all of the episodes listed - when obviously the reviews were for a different Lone Ranger dvd.Very disapointing, not the Lone Ranger DVD as expected."
1,dvd release a little bit crazy,"Ok, love Lone Ranger too but the DVD release is a little bit crazy. Why no chronological release in Season Boxs?No thanks - I'm still waiting before I'll buying it."
4,almost perfect,"I really like the speaker's styling. They are very compact and sturdy as well as being very easy to carry. The 9-volt international adapter with a folding plug is a very nice addition. I don't have a major problem with the sound quality. High notes at loud volumes may vibrate a little. Bass reproduction is weak. But speakers deliver a clear, sharp sound even if it lacks depth. I'd pay more for portable speakers that delivered a more robust sound, and it's a little surprising that Sony and other manufactures aren't offering a richer line. You would think with all the minidisk, Ipods, and other portable devices on the market there would be better options."
5,What a dandy little set of speakers,"I am not a techie person, so I was guided to buy these speakers based on what some of the other reviewers have said. My speakers came today - I plugged 'em into my Toshiba laptop and bingo - great sound. I also plugged them into my Dell MP3 player and got terrific results from that device too.I'm happy with the product. For what it's meant to be - a mini travel set of speakers it delivers a surprisingly good sound in a lightweight, portable small package. Perfect."
2,Don't Drop It!,I dropped the Sony Speakers on the bathroom floor from about 3 feet. One of the speakers broke off! There is no way to fix it. Now it's toast. I replaced it with the Altec Lansing inMotion speakers and was amazed in the improvement in sound. These speakers are discounted at Amazon making it a superior choice over the Sonys.
4,"Have Speakers, Will Travel",The size of these fold up speakers is great for travelling and they offer plenty of sound for presentations in small to mid sized conference rooms as needed. Only negative issue is a short power cord which sometimes limits the placement of the speakers.
3,not as good as hoped,"I was actually rather disappointed by the book. The subject matter is obviously very important and emotional, but I felt that the book didn't deliver as much as it could have. At various points in the text, the metaphorical passages seemed somewhat contrived and unoriginal."
3,"Cute, but it's not well made!","This little outfit is pretty cute on, but it is one piece and has to be treated very carefully. It's not very good to play dress up in, as it would probably rip apart if taken on and off too many times."
4,My son enjoyed it.,"I think the Christmas DVDs have more songs than some of the other We Sign videos. The other videos have the songs with the instructor and then the songs with the kids. This video didn't have any kids in it, although there are some pictured on the DVD case. My son enjoys having the songs with kids, so I'm kinda disappointed this didn't have any."
2,sign language,I did not care for this DVD very much. The person faces you and you have to learn the sign language backwards. Not easy to follow as well.
1,Junk,Worst thing I ever bought from Amazon in 4 years. Lens cover will not lock on base theads. Had to use plastic tape on theads to get back to launch site. Bow light no better.Unified Marine 50073855 Clamp On Waterproof Stern Light
1,Fell Apart On First Use - Not Marine Worthy At All,"I bought this unit for my 9 foot inflateable that had a 2HP Honda on the back. This light rattled apart after a few minutes of use. Battery contacts and lightbulb assembly are junk. Stay away and buy something reliable. Might be useful for an emergency backup, but as primary use, spend more money and do it right!"
4,best 100mb zip drive model (isn't this the 5th model?!?!),"Good price, great drive. Since it's usb powered, you don't have to drag around a power block with your laptop. I was going to buy the 250mb drive, but realized that most of the zip drives out there are 100mb anyway, and wouldn't read a 250mb zip disk. Out of all of the 100mb zip drive models I've used (the university I go to has different kinds of zip drives in their computer labs), this is my favorite....but it is kinda loud."
1,Home User,Boy am I sorry I ever bought this item. As mentioned by another user - it lasted less than 2 years - then it started to destroy any zip disk you attempted to write to. When I contacted customer service - instead of admitting they had a problem - I got - it sounds like maybe your drive is damaging your disks. You are out of warranty - but for $55.00 or so we will send you a reconditioned one with a 120 day warranty - and you pay for shipping. Forget it - save your money - buy a flash drive from Sony or use CDs - but don't buy anything from Iomega. They do not back their products - and their quality is highly questionable.
5,Used it to transfer data to WIndows Vista,"I purchased this after discovering that I had old digital pictures stored on 100 MB zip disks. I used it to successfully transfer contents of the disks to my new computer with Windows Vista. I wasn't sure it would work with Vista (I have read that the zip drives with parallel ports do not work with Vista). Based on previous reviews I did not install the software, I simply plugged it into my USB port and transfered them. Exactly what I needed and I received it in 3 days."
2,I don't like it,"On my pentium 4 running windows XP, USB 1.1 connection it works only about 25% of the time.. There seems to some ZIP 100 mb disks that it will read reliably, but other ZIP 100 mb disks are not recognized. The age of the disks makes no difference.Another computer running win 98 with an internal zip drive reads all disk without problems.I have had to mark the disks that it will read and use only them in this drive."
5,Sweet,I have owned this drive for almost one year and have had zero problems with it. Windows XP recognizes the device when you plug it in and you can use it immediately. 100mb is usually plenty of space for most things. I highly recommend this device!
3,"Great at first, but...","I don't know if it's the zip drive or my computer, but after using this zip drive for about 6 months, I now have trouble with it. When I insert a zip disk, the drive does not always respond (usually the green light blinks and it whirs when a disk is inserted). The computer tells me the drive is ""inaccessible"" and I have to restart the computer to get the disk out. This will also happen if I've used the drive successfully at first but then leave the disk in there. This is all very annoying and slows my work down considerably."
1,100 MB USB Zip Drive,It worked once for me and then the trouble stated. It would accept drives or if it did I had a lot of trouble getting it to release the drive. I took all of my zip drives to a computer with an internal zip drive and down loaded everything to a pocket drive and transfered the material to my main computer. The drive is sitting on my junk shelf. I do have a couple of scuzzy (sic) drives that I might get to use if I can find a scuzzy to usb or firewire adapter. I can't recommend the drive. This is the second usb zip drive I have and first gave me the same problem. They aren't made with the same quality as their earlier drives. Reliable flash drives are going to put this substandard drive out of business.
1,Junk,Sorry to say but i installed this junk on comp. with Windows ME and never got it to work...after several hours on the phone.....and on the tech website...downloaded there version of the software and nunerous attmpts to get it installed i gave up.About all this junk idd was mess up my hard drive.Evrytime i started up the comp i recieved a message tellign me no iomega drives had benn detected.Finally had to remove hard drive and wipe it clean.fortunately i always bakc up my hard drives...this was really nothing more than an exercise in total frustration and waste of money.
2,This product should work well on older operating systems...,"Doubtless this product would have gained a 5 star rating had I not found it necessary to return the product to the seller, unused. I strongly recommend obtaining detailed system compatibility information prior to purchase of any Iomega product in order to avoid the challenge of communicating with Iomega customer support."
3,Not happy with Iomega Thank goodness for Amazon and AEEC,"Very happy with the vendor I purchased this from AEEC. First Zip drive I received was defective (missing eject button). Thomas from AEEC mailed me (over night mail) a new one immediately. 5 stars for vendor. It's a good thing that there are dealers who still have Zip drives available. Iomega should have better support for the products they've sold. They bragged that a zip disc would last 25 years. That is one of the reasons that I purchased one. Here it is 10 years later and they don't make nor do they sell them any more. I had put over a 1,000 pictures on Zip discs and I wanted to burn them to CD's My old omega Zip drive quit on me while I was doing that. Again, thank goodness for Amazon and their vendors without them I would have lost all of those valuable photos."
