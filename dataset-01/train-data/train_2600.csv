2,For Nostalgic Fun,"This game by little means substitutes the original arcade ""720"" (the graphics and gameplay are shoddy even for 8-bit), but does do an OK job being converted to the NES and offers some nostalgic fun. One should EXPECT a redundant game, after all, this is a very old game and most old games were redundant on principle! If you want more variety out of your 8-bit skateboarding game, I recommend ""Skate Or Die!"" (for the record, this game was a ripoff, albeit a good one, of ""720"") or T & C Surf Designs. Otherwise, if you own a PS2 or Gamecube, get the ""Midway Arcade Treasures"" game for the full-on arcade ""720"" experience!"
2,Sub-par gaming at best,"This skateboarding game is okay for about 15 minutes until you realize that what you are doing is so redundant that you soon give up, only to never play the game again. If you are a hard core skateboarder, you might like this game a little bit, but most people have moved on to Tony Hawk's pro skating. Overall, this game is a rip-off of the much more gamer-friendly and fun ""Skate or Die""."
1,not worth anything,"First time I used this I hear a loud metallic pop in my oven. It scared the heck out of me! Turns out, this was so poorly made that it warped diagonally in heat. I should have known than to buy this brand thinking it was a good deal. I had previously bought a norpro wok that rusted in 3 uses. Absolute crap. I'm never buying this brand again."
1,Horrible- everything I made burned on the bottom.,"I baked home made cinnamon rolls on this right next to my old pan full of the as well, this pan burned the bottom of them, they were trash, a whole pan full wasted. Skip the nonstick crap and opt for commercial grade pans."
2,Ok board,"""This is a very basic bodyboard, poor quality, but for the price is ok. If you are thinking on doing seroius bodyboarding get a better one in a store, don't do it in this website...this is a kids board not for real surfers."""
1,hard to push button,Very difficult to push button to take pictures. Very flustrating when relying on this film camera. Will be looking for another
2,The tiniest version of the book,"I have had the original version, which is much much larger, for years. My rabbits had chewed it up mercilessly though so I wanted to replace it. This book is about one quarter the size of the original. Cute. But not what I thought I was ordering. Who knew miniature versions of books are now available. ??"
2,Very Over-Priced,"This is not writing but arranging...copies of articles, reviews, etc. from a variety of sources. As such, it may provide a 'service,' but these are not real biography. There are several of these 'arranger-writers' out there. The real problem is the price of these 'books.' Outrageously over-priced."
3,"Needs more Bob ""The Bear"" Hite vocals","Going into this dvd I knew it was recorded past their peak yrs still I had hope... Well sadly my hopes were dashed for several reasons. First Bob ""The Bear"" Hite only sings on 4 songs out of the 10 here...the Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown songs are not that good he seems to have a big ego and everytime the band starts to kick in and jam around him he quiets them down so he can do some lame ""trick"" playing on guitar or harmonica that to me just comes across as silly and boring... there are a few good moments in his 4 songs but not enough...the 2 songs sang by James Shane are OK blues numbers but are mostly showcase songs for his singing and playing not band songs... Bottom line I love Canned Heat and it was interesting to see The Bear and guys from this era of the band - just wish I could report that it was a better show.."
3,"Good, but book description is WRONG","DON'T get this book if you want the script for the series' best episode to date, ""In Excelsis Deo"" I bought it solely for that and was sorely disappointed to find out that the script for that episode is not in the book. The book description above needs to be changed to prevent future mix-ups."
4,For the serious fan,"This was a gift for my son, the Aaron Sorkin extreme fan. He wants to be a writer following in Sorkin's footsteps, so he read it cover to cover. Exactly what I hoped."
3,Slow delivery,Delivery took forever....over 2 weeks late. They said that they have no control over the delivery process but every other package I ordered and have sent since then has arrived with plenty of time so I can't imagine why this one got held up.
1,HORRIBLE GAME,"This NES game is nothing like the movie. You ride a skateboard through a street and dodge very deadly objects, such as soda cans, bannana peels, kidney beans, etc.. That's it... the whole game is you on a skateboard, a side-scrolling screen, trying to avoid objects being thrown at you. Why are objects flying at you? who the ---- knows????"
1,This is not Back to the Future....,"Back to the Future is one of the more popular movie franchises in...the movie industry. The game based off of the movie.....was a bombshell. It isn't even based off of the movie, since there's barely anything that relates to it.You play as a guy who's supposed to be Marty, but doesn't look like him. You walk through streets, collecting clocks and shooting bowling balls. That already sounds nothing like the movie. The music is as annoying as the game itself. It loops until you turn off the game.There is this one scene, however, where you play the guitar (In an awkward way), and different music plays. However, it's not Johnny Be Good. Instead, it's a garbled 8-bit mess.Could the game be any stupider? Yes, it can."
1,bad product,i got the cold cathode light kit and they were dead on arrival sad i still cant find a good case lighting mod sad.
2,The Fast and the Furious M.P. Haddix,"I was so excited when I heard that the final book was coming out. I sat down and read through this whole book at Barnes and Noble in one day.Basically, the end comes way too fast in this book. It almost makes me think that the author was under a major deadline and had to whip up something really fast.It felt like I was cruising through the book and suddenly everything was thrown at my face within 20 minutes of reading. I was like, whoa, wait, could you explain that again?It's not well detailed or explained. It seems like that happens a lot in a series. The author (I'm not saying this is what happened with Ms. Haddix) runs out of ""juice"" and the end ends up being kind of milky and you're not really sure of everything. That's how I felt about this book.If you're a fan of this series, read it just for the sake of finishing everything up, but don't set your expectations too high."
2,Depressing End to an Enjoyable Series,"This book is so fast paced that you feel like someone is summing up what happened during a rebellion and not a true detailed account. Which is what this book pretty much is, a summary. Not very well explained and it hops around too much. Honestly, Haddix dropped the ball on the last book. Among The Enemy was another disappointing book but it is better than this one.Poor writing, lack of detail leaves the devoted reader feeling Among the Betrayed, and you have to be Among The Brave to actually buy this book. Go to the library.2/5 stars."
3,Among the Free,"Hmm. Where do I start? I didn't find this book nearly as good as the others, and really only a step better than Among the Betrayed. We finally step back into Luke's shoes, which feels almost alien after ""being away"" from him for so long. While I'm glad the series had an enjoyable ending, I felt like the way it all came about was a letdown. Haddix is a great writer, and if you read her other books you know that she can be really good at twists and details and other such things. However, it felt like in this particular book, she took the easy way out. It didn't really make that much sense to me, and I felt like this book needed to be a lot longer, considering it was really ""the end of an era"".Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
3,okay,"i still like the idea of using cotton but the pads are way to narrow,especially if you want to use for menstruation unless you dont bleed very much. i'll use with several other layers and a moon cup and hopefully this will do the job. came with only one color and not as shown in this picture. i would have liked the variety."
5,Life changing!,"I absolutely love these! So much more comfortable than a regular pad. They don't crackle when I walk and don't give rashes. Of course, you have to be okay with washing them and you have to be comfortable with the whole process.These in particular are cute and very well made. I will definitely be buying more. Thanks!!!"
2,Ok- but not as good as some.,"I'm so glad I only bought a three pack. I purchased these products from this brand as well as two others. These shrunk in the dryer quit a bit and I had trouble getting them to lay flat and go back to their originial shape after washing and drying. I also purchased Fuzibunz brand- and they held up much better in the wash and for wear! But for the price, none of the brands are really worth it. If you sew, google for a pattern. I made an entire month's worth with 22 dollars worth of material and supplies. I love the ones I made so much better than the three brands I bought."
2,there are much better cloth pads out there.,"I love using cloth pads. They don't chafe or fall apart like disposable ones, even if you wear the same one all day. That said, I'm not a fan of glad rags. The idea of having inserts is a good one, but they don't work that well for me. They seem to ball up, and often when I pull up my underwear they slide so that the absorbent part is outside of my underwear. That's not helpful! And they kind of scrunch up and feel uncomfortable while I'm wearing them. I'd recommend going on etsy or looking for other brands on here that have a better design (I prefer ones that are one piece and are shaped like disposable pads)."
3,They're alright!,They are better than I expected but they are far from perfect. They leaked for me... but that could be just because I wasn't used to them... I'm not giving up! :)
2,not what I expected,"I have been using cloth menstrual pads for almost 2 years now. I currently use fuzzibunz, Charlie Banana and DIY cloth menstral pads. When these came in I was excited about the look and flannel until I washed them for the first time. They freyed really bad, the color faded and I had to repair some of the stitching. I also bought the glad rags liners and had the same issues. I am extremely disappointed with this product and I don't even think that I will ever use them. Thanks, but no thanks I will stick with my trusty Fuzzibunz, Charlie Bananas and DIY coth pads."
3,Pretty OK,"I really appreciate the intention behind Glad Rags, and the product works pretty okay. I have always had a heavy flow so GR really aren't great for me--they are small and bunchy and need to be changed very often, which means I would have to spend about $200 to be equipped for a week's cycle. Nonetheless, I am wiling to make the investment--because reusable products beat nasty disposables any day--but I will absolutely try out all other brands before I buy more of these. These really don't have me feeling confident that I can go out and stay fresh and dry...I'm betting there's something better out there."
4,Great Product!,"I just recently discovered cloth menstrual pads, and I am sold! Very comfortable, environmentally friendly, and not as much work as I expected. I don't think I'll ever use disposable again.There are quite a few companies making these, so I would recommend getting a few from several different places to see what works best for you.As for this particular brand, here are some pros/cons.Pros:Two removable absorbant cores means the amount of bulk/absorbency is adjustableStayed securely in place for meEasy to clean - just toss in whatever laundry load is convenient.Cons:After washing/drying, the pads were twisted and did not keep their shape. After snapping the assembled pad into a tight, square-ish shape (kinda hard to explain), they have returned to their original shape, but it's worth noting.I primarily use pads as menstrual cup backup, and these were too thick and bulky for that application.All three of mine came with a peace sign pattern. I really don't like it, but not a big deal."
3,Good quality and procust - a bit short.,"The biggest thing I notice with ""green"" pads (with the exception of GladRags Nighttime and Vimse Imse Nighttime/Long) is that the pads are always VERY SHORT, even in comparable to the environmental disposables. If you are a woman over about 120 lbs., these will more than likely not be long enough for good coverage. I can only use these at the very beginning and the very end of my cycle. They are very high quality, as all GladRags products are, but still very small - even before 1st use, fresh out of the box. I was all of my ""green"" pads in my machine on ""Tap Cold"" setting, on the extra gentle cycle in my washing machine - and line dry - but they still end up ""smaller"" due to being cotton. I have found that the only way to get them back to ""almost new"" size is to grad the ends and yank on them at the same time (I do the same for the inserts also)."
1,The quality of glad rags has declined over the years.,"I first bought glad rags nearly 20 years ago and they were SUPER well made, just as others have described here: they had thick cotton layers that stayed flat and the craftswomanship was very high quality. When my daughter reached the age of need, I was excited to buy her a collection of reusable pads and thought I knew just where to turn. Assuming they were still the same quality, I bought several sets for my daughter and invested quite a bit of money. I was deeply disappointed to find that they are indeed thinner, narrower and they crinkle up after washing to the point of being just about useless. So useless, in fact, that my daughter was turned off by them during her very first period and has refused to have anything to do with them in the years ever since. It has been a very disappointing experience. I wish that I could say these are everything you'd want them to be, but that's not my experience."
4,A new style of metal..,"This album is somewhere between black and classic iced earth like metal. I really like the sound. The high point of this album is most cirtainly the drumming provided by trodjav, who is a past member of dimmu borgir. Though a great album it lacks quality tracks, and the vocals arnt that great. This is why i gave it only 4out of 5"
5,wedding cake topper black tux first dance,"Very nicely detailed and has a wonderful paint job on facial features. Definitely worth the money, not cheap plastic, heavier weight than I Thought it would be."
5,Very nice topper. Exactly what we were looking for.,"My wife and I looked at many different toppers before finally coming across this one. We were very glad that we bought it for our wedding cake. We were married in a traditional ceremony, and definitely didn't want a topper with a half-dressed bride. We were happy to find this topper which more closely represents how we dressed for our own wedding. We would definitely recommend it. It looked very nice on our cake."
5,Lovely figurine with impressive detailing,"Both my mother and I are very impressed with this figurine and love it, and my mother is hard to please! It is hard to find nice figurines with a dark-haired bride that's not Hispanic or African. The few I found are more expensive, yet poorly detailed and often have bad paint job on the faces. The dresses and poses are boring, moreover. In contrast, this bride and groom are attractive in face, body, and clothing. Plus many little bonus details. The pose is gorgeous, the dress is flowing with multiple layers, the bride's hair has beautiful locks, she has pink flowers accenting her, the dress has ivory embroidery, and they even have a miniature veil and wedding bands on their ring fingers!Obviously a lot of care has gone into designing this figurine. We cannot be happier!"
5,I loved this book!,"Being a child of immigrants myself, I could really relate to the grittily real rendition of the American Dream, as portrayed in Let It Rain. And yet the beauty of the writing (which verges on but never really becomes magical realism) and the originality of the characters make the pathos of the Colon family's struggles enchanting and definitely worth the read. The constant tension between Don Chan, the ancient patriarch and romantic idealist, who is adrift in memories of his glory days as a political revolutionary in the Dominican Republic--and his practical and materialistic daughter-in-law, Esperanza--is the best part. Both comical and so true to life."
1,French subtitles PLEASE,"The quality of my ""english"" is not enough to allow me the understanding of such movies.Please make an effort (France is a cinephilic country, and most people like me miss thes movies)"
5,A Popular Classic Abandoned by 20th Century Fox Executives for Release on DVD,"This is a solid piece of Americana that never gets a bad review, even from within the ivory towers of IMDB's cinematic academe. Moreover, many critics rate the performance of Scott above that of Patton, the role for which he received Best Actor. Yet, in a 2002 interview, Peter Staddon of 20th Century Fox bluntly stated that there weren't any plans to release it on DVD. The movie's got a fan club, a fan web site, and memoriabilia on Ebay, yet the studio remains true to its bottom line and the fear that any money spent on digitization would result in a loss. I do not understand the politics nor the economies of this but wonder why these good people fear that this title would end up in the $5 bins of WalMart. Perhaps we, the loyalists of this film, are indeed too few to make a difference. It's disturbing how the dollar has canabilized this movie. What a crying shame."
5,DVD Please,"This movie is truly a classic. Very touching and funny is George C. Scott as Mordecai ""the flim flam man"". This could be classified as a road picture as Scott and Michael Sarrison an army deserter during the Vietnam War, go from town to town pulling scams on hicks who are also trying to get something for nothing. Henry Morgan is very funny as the sheriff chasing them. Where is the DVD for this movie. Sue Lyon who was a hottie in the 1960's plays the love interest of Sarrison, and daughter of Henry Morgan. Morgan starts out chasing a moonshiner named Dootle whom he thinks made his last escape by using an ""anphobibias"" vehicle. To not like this movie means you are humorless, there is a great car chase even by todays standards."
3,"Updated version, hardback","Nice updated hardcover 1987 version toPublisher: Prentice Hall (January 11, 1985)Language: EnglishISBN-10: 0201054337"
2,A disappointing mistake.,"While Daisy Head Maysie has many elements of a good Dr. Seuss book and a thoughtful story line with a good moral, it falls far short of the goals set by Dr. Seuss with his better known books. When the draft of this book was discovered posthumously, it was animated and published. The reason that Dr. Seuss did not do so himself when he was alive is clear. It was still too rough and unpolished. It contains many loose ends, and rhymes that don't quite work. No doubt, Dr. Seuss would have spent more time on it before he had it published. It was shelved for a reason. Stick with his better known works. END"
1,Really Stupid spin off...nothing like Grey's Anatomy,"I love when a favorite show gets a spinoff...it's like ice cream on cake, whip cream on your cappucino. Not this time. Great actors completely wasted by no story or drama or development. Gossip, sex, doctors treating patients is boring and worthless without characters that are likeable and actual storylines that lead to and from the gossip, sex and medical stuff. Sadly, Four episodes later it still seemed like pointless gossip, arguing, sex and medical stuff with no depth. BORING and the most disappointing part is it was a spin off of a great show. Even worse, it got renewed, while other great shows were cancelled, just because it was a spin off of a great show but not any good on it's own."
2,"Pretty awful, but theres hope","The fact that they did not bother to bring the show back after the strike, and one only recently started showing reruns leading up to the season primiere tells you that there were problems. I am hopeful that Shondra can turn it around for season 2.I'll stay away from giving away any storylines and just give my views. My biggest problem is that you have these succesful, well established. middle aged doctors running around like kids who just moved into thier first apartment. It's hard to believe Addison Sheppard can't find a guy to give her the time of day. I can tolerate and actually enjoy this type of behavior on Grays Anatomy because 1) they are younger and just out of med school it seems more believable 2) it was original when they did it.Unless they make serious changes, this show will fail for all the reason the Apprentice 2 with Martha Stewart failed. No one wants to see a lesser version of a popular show. especially with an out of place , inferior cast."
2,Overpriced for the number of episodes,"I rather like ""Private Practice"". It's often implausible, but that's one of the features of escapist entertainment. The cast is talented and attractive. I'm looking forward to watching the new season. But I can't give this first DVD set a good review, because it just isn't a good value.Due to the writers' strike, Season One of ""Private Practice"" only had 9 episodes. A normal season is 22 shows. But this collection's list price is the same as for a full season. The producers, having taken a major financial hit by not having as much advertising revenue as expected, are trying to recoup some of their costs from us by overpricing this set. I can't condone that.I rate this collection 3-4 stars for quality, but only 0-1 stars for value. That gives a combined rating of 2 stars: disappointing."
2,Frothy,"Spin-offs of TV series are rarely as good as the original, and ""Private Practice"" is a perfect example. Some reviewers have cautioned us not to try to compare this to ""Grey's Anatomy,"" but that is impossible--for me, at least. ""Grey's Anatomy"" was about the journey of five young interns on their way to becoming surgeons. The first two or three seasons were fascinating, but then it faded, and out of that fade was born ""Private Practice.""Set in Los Angeles it is about doctors who treat people with holistic medicine, acupuncture, psychiatry, doctors who do not dress like doctors, doctors who drink white wine and look as if they just dropped in the office from the beach. The story lines are most often about people problems, rather than medical problems.And as such, I just didn't find it worth watching when there are so many other better things."
3,GOOD START,"Only few spin-off have managed to be successful. Private Practice has a good potential but it still needs a rythm. It really started to be interesting when the season stops. Some characters have still been able to develop a good chemistry. The medical cases are different. Overall I found it fun, interesting and likeable."
3,"Not as good as Greys, but worth the money","This show was highly anticipated, but did not quite live up to the Greys' reputation (as most spinoffs don't). However, it is definitely worth the money, and you will love some of the characters.The plots are pretty fun and the relationships between the characters are intriguing. Overall, if you loved Greys, you will probably love this one, just not quite as much.Enjoy!"
2,"horribly bad, but a good idea","Shonda Rimes, famous for the groundbreaking and all around excellent medical soap opera ""Grey's Anatomy"" has made a big mistake. That mistake, deciding to produce and create the super dud ""Private Practice."" While the idea for the show was fresh and witty, it came out terribly. First of all, the show has none of the soap opera goodness, it is a boring and unbelievable episodic dramedy. The characters are all wrong. KaDee Strickland's role as the painfully annoying Charlotte King is in no way amusing. Also, Audra McDonald truly can not act, and Taye Diggs character was not adapted enough. He was more of a secondary character. It is especially painful to watch because the show could have been good. I just hope Shonda Rimes will make a few changes before season two airs. If the show were more soap operatic with recurring plots and had better writers and actors it might be something."
2,"I love Addison, but not this show",I have to say I thought I will be glad that my favorite character from Grey's will get her own show. But this show is under mediocre. There is no gripping atmosphere we found in GA. A small clinic and there's nothing they actually doing. Talking about sex and relationships and solving medical cases. I'm disappointed with the lack of brilliance in the writing. I don't know if it improves but I didn't like this first season. 6.5/10.
1,Private Practice,Maybe it was the mood I was in but I found this program to be inane. It was recommended as a funny medical show. I felt more like it was a frat movie set in a hospital.
4,Great,Great entertainment for relaxing on the weekends. It is also humorous and I like all of the actors in the show.
2,private practice,Would not play any movie that i require. Iwould like to get my money back or have the movies play correctly.
4,Best overview in print,"Raguin's overview of stained glass is the best available art historical overview of the medium, though it's not exactly exhaustive -- it covers the development of stained glass from early medieval time through the present day (though the examples of modern stained glass are comparatively weak), focusing on the evolving function of stained glass in its architectural context (as adornment, a didactic tool, an artistic medium). This is a reference book. You will not find patterns or techniques in it; and it does not examine any particular set of windows in depth; but it does frame the development of style and technology in an understandable narrative, and it has plenty of excellent photographs. Well worth the money."
5,Great Job !,"Very fast quick, easy transaction, I had the book at my door in no time even though I payed for regular shipping. A+"
4,Bearded Short Stories,"Taking a break from his usual novella and novel bizarro fare, this is Carlton Mellick's first collection of surreal and sci-fi short stories, including bonus stories that are very hard to find unless you can get a hold of Cancer Cute (an Avant Punk special edition not available for sale). The stories are pretty well put together, one or two that are a little hard to follow, but overall they create a picture of Carlton's earlier work that is great to read before you delve into his novels and novellas. From a place where humans carry their souls in little jars around with them, to a woman that has worlds tattooed on her arms, this has something bizarre for everyone to enjoy!"
5,science fiction at it's weirdest,"(Ash Lomen)""Sunset with a Beard"" may just be one of the best modern collections of science fiction I've ever come across. The collection oozes oddity from it's every orifice.And in the mucky-muck that is Carlton's bizarre universe you will find liquid plagues, haunted space travelers, drunken idiots, freakish aliens, love, betrayal and loss.This is a collection as timeless as it is original."
4,Mellick has me stumped!!,"Part of the fun of this collection of short stories is taking the challenge the author poses at the beginning of the book....guess which stories are sci fi, and which are surrealism. Oh, you can make arguments either way, but I'm not entirely sure which is which, BUT that's the genius of Carlton Mellick's writings. He is a craftsman of wordplay, and blends the best of both genres into each story, making it a blast to read, and even more fun to argue amongst other readers over which story falls into what category. I just love this guys style....Now when will we get to see one of his books or stories translated to screen?"
5,New Format to old movie,They formated the widescreen to fit the 1.33x1 screen. What is the wrong to format the 1.33 screen to fit the widescreen tv. Is not better than having black bars. I like the new format.
1,AWFUL,"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SOFTWARE. I have been trying for DAYS to complete just one DVD slideshow of photos and it still will not work. Every time the slideshow gets to the fourth slide, it quits working and says there has been error and the program needs to close. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING and such a waste.Not to mention the fact that I just bought this software from Staples for $40 and now see it here on Amazon.com for just ten bucks. WHAT A RIP OFF. It doesn't work anyway so even $10 would be a waste of money for this junk."
2,wood bee,product was poorly recorded had backgroung speech from another program in part of instructions. did not load as program said . had a hard time giting program off my computer. Did little to help me to use E-mail. Wasted my money
2,Only pretty good,"I did not find a lot of depth where the characters were concerned. The really interesting sections of the book were the recipes. The situations that the characters faced were humorous, but not my favorite series. If you do like this kind of book, try the San Francisco based Angie Amalfi series by Joanne Pence."
3,Not horrible,"This product wasn't really what I was expecting. The fabric is very see-through, and the Presidential Seal is very cartoonish. Luckily, I was using it in a play, so from 30 feet away it looks really good."
3,A DEEPLY EMOTIONALLY TROUBLED FEMALE WEREWOLF IN L.A.,"It is refreshing to have on the market a novel about a female werewolf that is credible. I say 'credible' because the storyline was easy to follow: Woman goes out of town where she barely survives an attack by a werewolf. Woman returns home to California, her wounds heal quickly, and with the advent of the full moon, changes into a Wolf. At times, the novel was a bit comical. In particular, the time when Phyllis awakes on the beach in tattered clothing with not a clue as to how she got there! Then scampering naked in panicked flight home. (In another instance, Phyllis as a Wolf, leaping wildly from car to car on the highway, disdainful of what she regards as 'steel monsters' and 'two-leggers'.) If you like werewolf novels, while this is not a great work, it's worth reading."
3,RUNNING WITH THE WOLVES,"Here is a story featuring a young woman who gets attacked by a wolf while on vacation, returns home to Los Angeles, where her wounds heal rather quickly, and fears she is going mad when with the coming of the full moon, she changes into a furry beast with a disdain for the ""two-leggers"" (i.e. ordinary human beings). There's lots of drama here to offer some excitement. The woman's monthly metamorphosis into a Wolf is, for her, an orgasmic experience, giving her a sense of untrammeled power and freedom -- though when human again, she is deeply troubled about her newly made dual self. An interesting story."
5,Industrial-dark,"This is to long. Dark ,drum, nihill, iluzionizmus. Great album from master Mick Harris (ex napalm death ,scorn,the weakener...)BUY or DIE !!!"
1,Largely unwatchable,"As a Tchaikovsky fan who has studied his life, I found this film revolting. I think it makes too much of his private life and what it does reveal of it, does not do it justice. The way his private life is dealt with makes everything else in this rather intellectual film somewhat redundant. There is too much overinterpretation perhaps of his personality and his theoretical suicide that is now largely discredited. Tchaikovsky was a more joyful being than the brooding, rather silent male model employed here. You'll find The Music Lovers by Ken Russell and some rather stiff communists biopics of him available on YouTube more informative and entertaining. Perhaps Poliakov/f as a film producer could have done a better job."
4,Composer,The story is well told and I now have a better understanding of his life. I have admired his compositions for many years. He is a genius and his music will live on for centuries.
1,Be warned,Not everyone cares to view a homosexual relationship. This is for those people. (The two people kissing on the front are both men.)
1,Over Priced!,"I didn't play yet. I just feel $10 for two dice, ten plastic chips, and a tiny cheap pad is over priced!"
2,Probability misused,"Anyone discussing a basically unknowable subject such as ""how life originated on earth"" should know how to avoid confusing the issue with insupportable assertions concerning the net probability of seemingly highly improbable events that could ocuur once over very long reaches of time or space. The author demonstrates repeatedly that he doesn't have this ability. Otherwise, the book is readable. I can't resist, however, giving away a bit of the plot, end the end, life did evolve."
2,mine as well avoid this baby,"This game is WAY too slow and hard to get into. Okay, so a nice challenge is always a welcome. Well no, that's not true. All I remember about this game is walking around a block and having these purple grapes suddenly appear, and you had to attack them and then slowly keep walking until you found the end of the level. But it was too hard and slow and not good."
2,it's a very hard book to follow.(needs more examples),It would be very halpful if this book supplied solutions to the problems in the back of the book.
1,Doesn't fit,I concur with the previous review. This protective cap appears to be a cheaply made knockoff and it is just enough too small to not fit onto the shaver head. Shaver Outlet says they have tried them and they fit fine on the ones they tested. Guess I'm just unlucky....
2,VocoPro,"The player is not a bad player but it does not read CDG properly. So I would advice any purchasers who would like to order this product for karaoke CDG uses, choose another player."
5,Great price for an amazing box set of Liszt transcriptions,"Liszt's task was enormously difficult to reduce all nine of Beethoven's Symphonies to the level of a single piano and to make this possible for just ten fingers. Absolutely amazing! To make the piano sound as an orchestra would be an illusion and unreachable for any other composer. Not Liszt, he consciously made wonderful, brilliant piano pieces out of Beethoven's Symphonies. Another aspect to mention is Liszt's obvious admiration and respect for the works. He did not change or add anything in the compositions, on the opposite, he just accommodated the symphonic structure within the limitations of the piano, with his unmistakable sense for perfection. To me, that is what Liszt is known for, making the impossible sound like the inevitable."
3,INTERESTING,"I found this disk extremely interesting, the way Liszt transcribed all this symphonies, i think the interpretation is too technical leaving behind at some point the beautifulness of beethoven's symphonies. I especially liked the 6th symphony on piano, found it beautiful, i did like it more than the orchestra version, for us that love this music I do think it is a necessary step to listen this transcriptions, to understand better Beethoven Symphonies, particularly in piano you can realize better the transition between the Mozart-Beethoven and BEETHOVEN-BEETHOVEN."
3,"Works pretty good, smells like Nutmeg","I love Porter's Original lotion. I have it on every sink in my bathroom. I don't love the smell of their Original lotion though, so I tried the ""Sweet Lotion."" Unfortunately, I really don't care for this scent either, only this scent stays on for hours. The closest scent I can say it smells like is Nutmeg, and the smell stays on for a long time. On their original lotion, it only smells for about a minute and then goes away. This scent doesn't, so you will smell like nutmeg for quite awhile!! Also, I find this one leaves a bit of a residue on me, and the original doesn't. So, I will only buy the original from now on....just my preference."
3,Good Source of Info,"This is a good source of data on Oliver tractors. I wish it had been more in-depth, but it is a start."
1,Fresh foods should be delivered fresh not spoiled,"I was so excited to find fresh Thai chili peppers that could be delivered to my door step after searching the fresh markets in NYC with out luck. I ordered 14 oz of the fresh Thai chili to make infusions from, so they had to be fresh. I expected that the company would expedite the peppers to guarantee their freshness. To my dismay, they were shipped ground from LA to NY with a cold pack (requiring some forethought) but it took 5 days to be delivered. By the time they arrived, the cold pack melted and at least 50% of the peppers were moldy and rotten. I sent an email requesting a replacement the order with out a response from the company or Amazon. I ended up with just over a dozen usable peppers after I picked through the soggy rotten mess. Too bad. I would have been a regular customer."
4,"Works well, oil leak issue","This chain saw worked well for the small amount of light use I've put it to so far. Only problem was that the bar/chain oil leaked out while it was not in use. I found out from a local shop that Poulan referred me to that if you store it on it's side (motor down, bar up), this shouldn't happen. I didn't see anything in the manual about this."
4,great value,I was looking for a inexpensive chainsaw for some light work around the yard.This one worked out great
2,slippery,"The chain saw is okay but, when you try to hold it with gloves, it can slip out of your left hand, which could make it a very serious situation. I have tried to figure out a solution to make the left handle less slippery but to this date haven't come up with a good one. I almost returned it because of that."
3,Del's saw purchase,"As a user of a Remington Electric saw for the past 15 years, Del knows electric saws... the new Poulan saw is excellent for the price... only complaint is no adjustment tool was included, so screwdriver and a socket and drive bar were needed from husband's tool kit.... otherwise a great deal.Poulan 1420 14-Inch 2.0 HP Electric Chain Saw"
4,easy,This product is very easy to use. I trimmed a medium size tree without problem. The only con is you have to pump the button frequently to give it oil.
5,great little saw for the price,"After five years of fairly heavy use, I may have blown the motor and will be looking at the 16"" model. Having to keep the oil button depressed is a bit of a bother, and if you're cutting more than a few hundred feet from an outlet you'll need a gas model, but otherwise this can't be beat. It's virtually maintenance free--I keep it oiled and tensioned and change the chain each year, but otherwise nothing is needed. It's quiet, very light-weight, and gets into tight places not accessible to bigger models. I take down 100-foot trees and cut them up without any problems. I feel I have gotten my money's worth many times over."
2,wrong choice,"Saw cuts fine,but it is so loud I have to use ear protectors and the handle is so slick that I had to duct tape it."
5,I like how Eric Wilson always starts with a mystery.,"I like it when TOM explores ghost towns and caves. I wish that I would be allowed to go explore ghost towns too. The part I like best is when they find CHUCK and TIPPY at the end. I want to read all of his books. I CAN NAME SOME OF THEM. COLD MIDNIGHT IN VIEUX QUEBEC, CODE RED IN THE SUPER MALL, THE GREEN GABLES DETECTIVE, SPIRT IN THE RAINFOREST, THE ICE DIAMAND QUEST, MURDER ON THE CANADIAN and many more"
3,Expected just a bit more from Microsoft for the Money,"For the amount of money to get these particular 10 games, all of which either turned up as a game that shipped with one or more versions of windows and a few others that were in previous Entertainment Paks for Windows, 10 games that required little additional programming to port to the new Pocket PC platform was bit for a disappointment for the money. On the other hand, these are the games that many of us who work with a desktop or laptop at other times are familiar with, and most are easy to play in a screen where control of the on-screen activity is mostly a stylus or entering words. There are a number of games from previous entertainment paks that could have been ported and included and were not. That was disappointing, as it would be nice to change out these 8-10 games to keep something 'fresh' to do while waiting in lines, for a table in a restaurant or in a doctor's office. You can only play solitaire for so long and not get really bored."
4,A Must have,"A must have. All the games are not good, but the chess game and some other games are good. A good time pass when you are tired."
5,"Take a course on Anne Rice, you'll love it!","What a great book. I felt like I was in class taking Anne Rice 101! Great insights on her books especially on ""Interview with a vampire"". Great reading."
4,Good but second edition needs to cover version 4,I teach from this book and I find it easy to read but the problem lies in what version of the as400 that you have installed
1,such a painful read,"As a student, I find this book to be a complete nightmare. It is poorly organized and structured. The author seems to prefer to write in long paragraphs and carry-on sentences which makes it rather difficult to follow. I may be biased. Let's draw your own conclusion, by comparing this book to any other well-written computer books(any O'Reilly or Wrox book) on the market."
5,Fantasia; Our Natonal Treasure Can Write Too!,"This book tells the story of Fantasia Barrino, American Idol winner in 2003. This delightful presentation is due, in part, to Fantasia's sense of herself in a world that she knows she can now leave behind but never lose sight of her beginnings lest she lose so much of her endearing charm as a person, a singer or a writer. Her voice is truly God's gift to her and is given through her to her audience. Her story is not unlike many others she knows, however, what she hasn't yet realized is that she has given voice to tens of thousands of young women who have suffered a similar fate. This book is as honest and upfront as it gets and wields even more power because we know her from that other perspective...her success on American Idol. Life Is Not A Fairy Tale is the brave story of one woman's struggle through adversity, shame and lonliness who, like a Phoenix, rose from the ashes of her life to become a Star! Well done, Fantasia!"
5,Fantasia is a shero to us all,"I am amazed at how remarkably strong you are Fantasia. Please stay humble, and strong. I am proud of you!"
2,I wasn't happy.......,"I really enjoyed the person I saw on American idol who called herself Fantasia. So full of life, so expressive, such a good singer. Then why didn't I enjoy the book? Fantasia seemed to use the book to preach to us about her religious beliefs instead of sticking to the story about her life. I have my own strong religious beliefs and didn't fancy her trying to change my thoughts about God. If she didn't have enough material from her own life to full the pages of a book, I think she should have just stuck with singing. THAT I enjoy."
2,Life Is Not A Fairy Tale,"The book reads on a very elementary level. I guess for a first time effort it was o.k. If she had assistance, what were they doing. Maybe they wanted the project to sound and be very unpolished.??? Informative and interesting to a small degree. Very repeditive."
2,Writer does poor justice to Fantasia's story,"While I think Fantasia seems to be an interesting person by what I've seen of her on TV, the book as written is a disaster. Badly constructed sentences, poorly organized chapters, the writer apparently not sure of how to write in Fantasia's voice. This is supposed to be a dictation of her truth, but it's unclear how much of it is really Fantasia or the writer's imagining of what Fantasia really meant to say. Very confusing to say the least."
5,The Truth shall set you free!!!,"This is a wonderful read!!!Fantasia, is my definition of a strong black woman: she's speaking the truth about her past and in hopes that it could and would help just one person that reads it. There are millions of people out there that wouldn't dare say that they can't read, or some of the other things in their past would they bring to light and share it with the world.If you haven't gotten the book yet, GET It now!!! She's always touched my heart and soul with her music and now this book.. I can relate to some of the things that she's gone through. And, I truly tip my hat to her and knowing that she is a God fearing woman, All Things are Possible through Him!The holidays are coming up and what a wonderful gift to give to the younger generation or anyone for that matter.This book is a must read!!!"
3,Great Story,THis book had a great story but the writing was very elementary - so we found it hard to read for that reason.
5,Best Science Fiction CD ever!,I am really enjoying this purchase. It is GREAT! I love the selections of music and the City of Prague Philharmonic did a fabulous job. This is class A-1 work. All my favorite pieces are available to me now without having to buy several albums. The 4 CD set contains 61 selections. I would highly recommend this great CD. The music is full and robust with a full orchestra.
1,BUYERS BEWARE WE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH OUR SAMSUNG DIGIMAX,"We have had our Digimax 800 K close to 2 years now.It goes through batteries like crazy, we have gone through 6 - 10 batteries just to have pictures of the kids opening they're gifts. It's really bad on batteries. We have tried every brand on the market, up and including what Samsung suggests to use, and there is no difference. The camera dies after 4-6 pictures that requires a flash.It's a great camera outside, providing, you don't require a flash.So having said that, Would we recommend this little camera to beginners. Absolutely not!!! We are very disappointed with our camera, and we paid (more) when they first came out on the market.Thanks for listening"
3,You can do a lot better,"I've had one of these cameras for about a year. It does OK if your have PERFECT conditions - still not that good, though. Also have a Fuji finepix 2300. You can get it for another 20-30 dollars more. It is 2.1 MP and has a color LCD panel. The pictures it takes are great - no comparison to the Samsung. I just would not see paying that much for such a poor digicam"
3,Not Bad for the Money,"Batteries seem to be everyones biggest problem. I bough some NiMh rechargeable batteries that will last for at least 80 pictures on a single charge. When I upload pictures on the computer I use an adapter since it does use a lot of battery power. It takes great outdoor photos. Indoor photos don't work out too well. It doesn't have an LCD screen, but if in doubt, you can just take another since it doesn't cost anything anyway. If you're going to use it mostly for viewing on a computer and for sending by Email it is great. For printing photos it's not high enough resolution."
4,Excellent for Starters,"I got this camera a while back . This is really a class on its on. Within this price & such good features , I think its very hard to get a good deal like this one. It has a lot of memory enough for a occasion & the resolution is also too good. I have never used a digital camera before & I surely liked the easiness of this camera as well as it is very light & handy. When I first showed the results of this camera my friends were surprised but i thought there is no need to as this comes from a very good company. infact even my previous camera was from Samsung . So go ahead everyone & try this if you have never tried a digital camera before & you wil be enjoy it."
5,An informative and usefull guide on how to succeed.,"Everyone has had some failures in life, some people fail at the first hurdle, and other just before they get success.If you want to be someone who succeeds, then you need to read Success Bound by Randy Gilbert.It is a great, informative and interesting book, packed full of usefull information on how to get over the failures that we all have to cope with.Each of the chapters is relevant to help you succeed, unlike some other success books, it is written for everyone.

You do, because the information is invaluable.The book is written in such a way, that you won't get bored reading it, and you will find that you will be reading the book over and over again.If you are going to buy any success book, then you need to buy Success Bound."
5,Sometimes Failure is Success,"After getting fired from a job I hated I decided to pick up this book because I was pretty miserable with my life in general even when I had the job.One thing I didn't realize was that I really needed to be willing to accept failure. With the job I had I really wanted to quit but I was too afraid of failing. The whole thought of ""crashing and burning"" was unbearable to me.Now instead of just looking for another job, which is not my calling, I am now pursuing my real dream and that is to start and run my own technology business. The whole thought of failing before was just too scary and frightening to me but thanks to Randy Gilbert I don't really have the fear anymore and I now have the true courage to go forward with my dreams and deal with whatever setbacks I may have to deal with.Like Randy Gilbert said, ""You have only one life - make it a good one""."
5,This Has Become My FAVORITE Book,"I don't usually read this type of book, but I read a review by another reader and I got so curious I just had to get it.I can't say enough about how much Success Bound has helped me already. I am shy and I had let the fear of failure run my life.BUT NO MORE . . . Randy Gilbert has completely changed that. I am finally on a path that is taking me to confidence and happiness.All I can say to any of you who read this is, don't hestitate to buy and read Success Bound. I'm already happier than I have ever been and I'm looking forward to reading Randy's next book.Signed,Still shy, but no longer afraid of life."
5,Bound to Succeed!,"Randy Gilbert's ""Success Bound"" gets down to the nitty-gritty on the psychology of succeeding in a very simple and direct manner. You'll not only enjoy reading the book, you'll enjoy USING it!"
5,"This is a ""Must Read"" for anyone who aspires to win.","&#65533;Success Bound&#65533; is a must read for anyone who is looking forthe sometimes elusive answers, to the questions of what ittakes to succeed in life. Whether you are a believer or not,Randy Gilbert does a first rate job of taking you by the handand walking you through the maze, we call life. I highlyrecommend it.* Jack Wilson, author & publisher..."
4,Success Bound: Breaking Free of Mediocrity,Success is a journey and effectiveness is the vehicle- -Behind every sucess story there is abig history of failures- he who knows how to maange failures knows really how to succed . In fact this is the first good book that I have seen which equates managmentr of Sucees is only a concept but management of Failures is the real success managemntIt is a book worth reading : based on several expereinced successful personalities
5,Success Bound-Become Bound by Success,"The book is really fantastic and has helped me a lot in changing my thoughts to positive thoughts.The road to success is not just having positive thoughts but an extra effort by the person to achieve success.Also the road to success comes from a failure since ""Failure is the stepping stone to success""."
3,Not Worth the Money,"I purchased this saw because I wanted a precision unit that took little space in my garage. While I like the precision of the rip fence, there are some problems with other aspects. (1)The miter gauge fits loosely in its slot, making it suspect for really accurate work. (2)The miter guage does not have slots for attaching an extension. (3)The stops for the tilt adjustment are very difficult to set. A handwheel driven tilt is needed. (4)The rip fence is not solid and I hesitate to clamp extentions, stops, etc to it."
5,Excellence!!!!,Danzzaj is refreshing and an awesome example of great Latin Jazz. All I hope is that Mr. Mattos comes up with another masterpiece soon.
5,Great CD,"I have both their CD's, and Bleed is fantastic. Not many songs but each one rocks hard and is worth the money if your a die hard fan of The Missing. Cant wait for a 3rd album cause The Missing is great band with female vocals that blow your mind away."
1,I can take it no more...,"Based on the reviews I was excited to read this book. I thought I could learn a little about Paris, and it sounded interesting and funny. What I learned is that Adam Gopnik loves to talk about himself and his hip New York City/Paris life, but it is by far not interesting to read. I never stop reading books, but this one is painful and pretentious. Can I get a refund?"
4,AN AMERICAN IN PARIS,"I had not really heard of this book until I saw Gopnik on Charle Rose after the interview I knew I had to go out and get this book. I can honestly say I was not disappointed, it is a quick read and I was fascinated at the authors experience as an American living in Paris. At times he name drops and you sort of feel he is one of these insipid, fey people, like the annoying Arthur Slesinger, Jr., who's easily impressed by famous people and famous places, but overall, I liked what he had to say and he's a very good writer, I really felt I was in Paris with him at times."
1,Poor book.,"This is a 'lets make fun of the French' book. In reality, a similar book can be written by many expatriates in every country, including foreigners living in the US and New York. Mr. Gupnik refuses to accept the differences between the different cultures and seemingly expects the French to behave as if they are funny speaking Americans.This is a useless book, fake and pompous. Don't waste your time and money with it."
3,Not Listener Friendly,"I have always enjoyed Adam Gopnik's writing, so when I set out on a long drive I was looking forward to listening to him read his own book, From Paris to the Moon. But I turned off the CD after a while because Gopnik is such a second-rate reader. He drops his voice at the end of a sentence and over-emphasizes phrase divisions, so the general effect is bumpy, monotonous and tiresome. Who chooses the reader of audio books, I wonder? Does the author always have first dibs? In this case, an experienced speaker would have done better by the book than did the author."
2,Paris to the Moon,"Boring and long winded, I did like the description of the Parisians attitude towards other people's problems ""eh' perhaps it is a bad day for you""! cracked me up"
2,audio book narrator,"The author, who narrates the story, speaks so quickly that it is somewhat difficult to get interested in the book. There are interesting parts, but I often found my mind drifting off."
2,"Death by commas!!,,,,","I enjoy travel essays, but this was so hard to get through. The author tries to clarify his clarifications in depth all in one sentence. He also goes over the top with words only a francophile would know. I believe the author needs to get over himself and remember, you are writing travel essays, not an encyclopedia of your life."
2,a great disappointment,"Several people who'd previously visited France recommended this book.For many years now I have lived in France and, I must say, this book is unrealistic. Adam Gopnick is pretentious. His vision of life here has been clouded by his ex-patriot status, his US dollars, and a pampered life in a company-paid apartment in one of the most expensive areas of Paris.I was expecting a more realistic experience of life in France; this was a great disappointment."
2,Paris to the zzzzzzz,"I bought this book on a whim, and have regretted it ever since. Adam Gopnick, the author, is such an elitist that it was hard for me relate with the different Paris he lived in. His stories were pretentious and so boring that I had to skip several sections to stop myself from burning the book. (I unfortunately, forced myself to go back to read the skipped sections.) The most redeaming parts were about his son and daughter and they save the book from getting just one star. Adam Gopnick is no Peter Mayle."
1,Paris to the Moon... Back to New York,"I thought I was going to love this book with this romantic title. It turned out to be that the author did not enjoy his stay and always compared Paris to New York--the apple city always won, of course. When his son had curiosity about soccer, the author panicked and taught him to play baseball. He even disliked the way he was greeted at any Parisian Cafe, ""how's madam"" and instead missed the aloofeness of any Cafe in New York where he could get a cup of coffee without anyone bothering to say hi."
1,A different opinion,"Some people seem to love this book - I will admit I enjoyed reading the political background about Paris and the history, and I am an avid reader of the New Yorker. However, the bulk of the work was devoted to Mr G's interpretationof his experience in Paris, and it struck me as an endless series of complaints that life there was not as he experienced in New York. I suppose to some this is interesting, but I found it tedious, boring, and sad. I had to stop reading the book around page 80 - I think after his complaints about not having a decent New York style gym to go to. Rather than understanding that Parisians get their exercise by walking he complains that he can't use his walkman and workout like he's used to. As one who loves Paris I can't jive with so much kvetching."
2,"About kids, not paris","As a French minor and an enthusiast of the culture in general, I was hoping to discover some witty insights into the differences between French and American culture in this book. Instead, this book can be classified as a guide to 'bringing up baby' in a foreign country. This was not what I expected at all. Although Gopnik made a few humorous remarks, most of his observations amounted to complaining about Parisian life... finding an apartment, going to the mall, getting Christmas tree lights. I was also not pleased about the section referring to Gopnik attending his wife's visit to the gyno at the discovery of her second pregnancy. I was looking to escape to the 'city of lights' while reading this book, not to TLC's A Baby Story takes Paris."
1,Not worth the time to read it.,"I really do try to finish the books I start to read. I at least give it a couple chapters. With this book, I could do neither. Great, the author supposes he has an insight into the politics and nuances that the rest of us don't get. Great, his professor-parents were propelled into the upper middle classes in the 70s. Great, I don't care. Don't read this book if you want a Paris vacation in a book. Read it if you want a history/politics lesson with a lot of pretentiousness thrown in."
1,Lost in Emptiness,"The title for this book should have been VAPID. This book is vapid, like the New Yorker. It's for people who want to look important being bored. Like New Yorker readers. It takes Gopnik five pages of philosophical musings on how many angels fit on the head of a pin to make a point about cracks in the sidewalk. Every chapter is like that. The most exciting part of the book is when he talks about how boring soccer is. His life is boring. All he can talk about are old pin ball machines in old bars. I've got that right here. I guess Paris is a pretty boring place. There is nothing of use in this book."
3,Surprisingly Trivial,"In the late 1990's, I really enjoyed reading Adam Gopnik's Paris articles in the New Yorker. I thought his stories were charming and well written. Unfortunately, ""Paris to the Moon"" does not live up to the standards he set in the New Yorker. This compilation of his earlier essays does not work. There is no glue which binds them to a greater narrative. As a reader, I was left with basic questions. What does Adam Gopnik do for a living? Does his wife have a job? Do they have friends? These are all basic questions that an autobiographical writer should be addressing. Sections of the book are engaging but without this basic narrative cement, I found ""Paris to the Moon"" to be surprisingly trivial."
3,Uneven read,"Adam Gopnick moves his wife and infant son to Paris from New York City. He works for the New Yorker so all this is possible. And although the book at times is just hilarious, funny, and insightful, many of the chapters read like they were separate New Yorker articles. There is a wonderful story of his trying to first find a gym to join, and then joining process and then the discovery of how the French use the gym. This little gem may be worth the price of the book alone. But later I found an ""article"" on the fashion industry just boring. I found the book to be a very uneven read that I could only recommend to persons going to visit or live in France."
4,Great Writing; Very Perceptive Observations,"Mr. Gopnik has a talent for moving from the personal to the universal and back... making the connection between his son's park playing habits and the inevitable French political corruption scandal du jour. As a Canadian living in France, what I appreciate most about this book is not just the great writing but the fact that Mr. Gopnik recognizes the sometimes infuriating things about ""the French"" (insofar as one can generalize) but loves them and their country (as much as they do) anyway. The only small weakness: it seems at times to be a collection of articles because he repeats himself (about the best walk in Paris, for example) a number of times on a number of things... maybe a bit more cohesive editing would solve this very minor flaw to a very great book."
5,Paris like you've never seen it before,"After reading this book, I want to do two things: 1) go to Paris, and 2) have lunch with Adam Gopnik. A surreal blend of travel literature, history, and even philosophy, _From Paris to the Moon_ will almost certainly contain anecdotes and observations unknown to even the most diehard Parisian-trivia buffs. For those of us who haven't been studying the city for a lifetime, Gopnik provides an accessible overview of his subject before delving into the nitty-gritty. Beautifully written and tremendously engaging."
3,I wanted to like it,"Maybe it helps to be a regular New Yorker reader or to be very familiar with Paris. I just wanted a cozy armchair travel experience, but this wasn't it. I kept putting this down to read other books and finally gave it up.Tidbits in the book intrigued me (activities with his son, interaction with the French, descriptions of food), but much of it was ""over my head."" That was frustrating and ultimately drove me away from the book.Since each reader brings a different background to their reading of the book, give it a try. Maybe it will be perfectly wonderful for you."
2,An American Snob in Paris,"Pretentious, what a bore. There is nothing worse than non-stop name-dropping or obscure literary and cultural references except of course if you are subjected to ""cute child"" stories which are only cute to the poor child's indulgent parents. I kept hoping this book would redeem itself thus pushing me to finish it. It did not."
2,look elsewhere for a view of paris,"Having appreciated many of Gopnik's articles in the NY'er, I expected quite alot out of this book and was quite disappointed. I appreciated neither the way the book was written (sloppily) nor the author's attempt to portray Paris (snobbily). While the book offers a few particular insights to french politics and a sense of the generalized aura that scratch a bit below the surface of what a typical tourist might experience, it doesn't go nearly as deeply as a reader would honestly hope or expect from someone who lived in Paris for five years."
1,You're better off sticking to your own memories of France.,"I trudged my way through this book, sometimes even rolling my eyes. I hoped things would pick up, get a bit more interesting, or lively, but they did not. There's nothing wrong with being a Francophile, but Gopnick at times comes off as blinded by his apparent belief that all things Parisien are superior. There is a self-consciousness and yet also an odd snobbery (seeing as how he's not French, but puts himself in the elite club) about his stance. His observations about his ex-pat experiences aren't all that unique or original, unfortunately, and somehow come off as slightly annoying. My paperback cover announces that it's a national bestseller, and also ""the finest book on France in recent years."" I find these misleading, and feel sort of like I did after walking out of ""The Blair Witch Project"" after all the hype."
1,Don't waste your time!,"We read this book for our book club. No one could finish it! It's like reading a very, very boring diary. I really can't figure out how it won any type of an award. Don't waste your time or money. I think someone sold the Emperor some new clothes!"
4,Made me Laugh Out Loud,"I loved this book because it was insightful about ""really"" living in Paris and it made me laugh. I loved the part about ""La Choisir du Roi"" and the ""Chocolate Chaud."" It was very endearing and it made me dream of Paris. The only thing that disturbed me was the absence of Martha until the part about the baby. Wasn't she there all the time? Even though Mr. Gopnik doesn't understand the fine points of soccer I forgive him. Anyone who likes Europe, France, Paris will love this book."
1,Disappointing,"I hate to trash an author's book, but I am afraid it is very necessary in this case. I bought this book recently, I found it very indulgent, and very highbrow and boring. I was intrigued by the beautiful title in that I love everything about Paris. I then passed the book to my prolific reading girlfriend who struggled to finish the book too. The author talks about himself, his kids and historic arties - rarely did I learn anything about Paris. If you want a good book on Paris, I wouldrecommend ""The Insider's Guide to Paris"" by Kate Muir. In contrast this book both very informative and filled with humour."
3,Not Quite the Moon,"I like Gopnik's writing--some of his magazine work is brilliant--and I opened the cover wanting to love this book, especially since my wife and I were doing a lot of walking around Paris at the time. But as a travel piece, it doesn't get into orbit. Some of the reviews seem overly harsh, based more on the book's focus not ending up meeting the reader's expectations; I founding it annoying at times for the same reasons. The five-star reviews, though, need questioning: I mean, no way can this be up there with the best of the genre, starting with Mark Twain. Essentially, though Paris to the Moon has many insights into Frenchiness, it is essentially about a New York writer taking his family to Paris, rather than about Paris.I would love to see Gopnik write a novel on the same subject, a dramatic comedy, since he has all the elements for a great work--writers, models, foodies, artists; NY meets Paris."
1,"Snob ""literature""","Gopnik has fallen into the same self-absorbed, pretentious and irrelevant fog that afflicts many American writers in Paris. But he outdoes them all with some of the phoniest, elitist writing I've come across in years. Seriously, does he have to use words like fecundity? His chapter on soccer helped me get through to the end (I rarely give up on a book), and his love for his son is truly heartwarming, but the play-by-play of a day with Luke should have been trimmed to one chapter. When he does get around to observing Paris and Parisians, his overwritten comparisons and conclusions are absurd. His self congratulatory recounting of the ownership change and ensuing revolt at The Balzar restaurant is particularly annoying. A word of warning: Beware any jacket endorsement that celebrates this type of book as ""literature."" Gopnik tries very hard to impress us with his snob literature, but fails miserably."
3,Blah Blah Blah,"The book gives you a unique sense of one family's view of living in Paris for 5 years but I didn't find it to be the delightful read that some did. Some terrific nuggets mixed in with a lot of self-discovery type prose that I found long-winded, but that's just mho."
2,"Yes if you're a francophile, no if you like good literature","This is a book for francophiles. It might be a good resource on French culture and attitudes if you will be spending an extended time traveling or working in France. But if you are looking for good literature, skip it.Should have known by just opening the cover - the first SENTENCE in the book has 9 (count 'em - NINE) commas in it. The prose is self-centered, self-conscious, and self-congratulatory.You are regaled by sentences like this one: ""The lucidity of Parisian empiricism was bought at the price of the grandiosity of Parisian abstraction, and you couldn't have one without the other"".Gopnik is the sort of author who thinks when he breaks a fingernail, it's significant and we need to know. You get an entire chapter devoted to a bedtime story he made up for his son, end to end.The author needs to get over himself, and the editor needs to go back to flipping burgers. Spend your valuable leisure hours reading something else!"
2,dissapointing,"I love Gopnik's New Yorker work, but this was a real let down. The writing is good, but it rambles and is like he felt he must come up with an idea for a book - should have been an article. Just doesn't hold the interest."
3,"There's no ""There"" There","This disappointed me, a huge fan of Gopnik's from his New Yorker writings. This book is a quick read, largely because of page layout. I actually finished it during a Delta flight. But I should have seen a red light go off in the bookstore's price sticker: the book is categorized as a memoir. Once more: it is NOT a travel book, rather it is a memoir. While there are Paris anecdotes and tidbits scattered throughout, they are mere olives in the martini of parisian travel literature. If you want a book about Paris, this isn't it. If you want a book abut Paris written by, as the author says, ""a yuppie family guy writer,"" this is your book. There's a lot of Gopnik, his wife, his child(ren), his friends here. But there's little in the way of ""there"" there. Caveat emptor."
3,Paris to the Moon,"Having read very positive reviews of this book, and being passionate about Paris, I expected to love it. Instead I found it boring. Certainly Mr. Gopnik writes very well, and there were occasional passages that amused me or rang true of my own experience living in Paris. However, on the whole I found the book to be less about Paris than about Mr. Gopnik's inner world, and that, to me, was self-absorbed rather than compelling."
5,A wonderful book about cultural interchange...,"I just want to thank Adam Gopnik for this wonderful book. I am a passionate consumer of travel books and more precisely of essays that tell stories of people confronting their own views of things, their own cultural backgrounds with those of the new culture they are visiting, and how that experience helps them grow and mature in their own lives (I highly recommend ""The Road to Santiago"" by Cees Noteboom). Mr. Gopnik succeeds in writing a very enjoyable book, capturing all the sensuality of Paris life by disclosing the pleasure of everyday things in a way only a witty-intellectual foreigner person could do."
1,Une tres grande DUD!,"Despite what he may think of himself, Janet Flanner lived in Paris, Janet Flanner wrote about Paris for the New Yorker, and Adam Gopnik ain't no Janet Flanner. He seems to have two tasks here: bragging to the reader how much he knows, and talking about his son. The first is pretentious, difficult to read; the latter is arduous to even skim over, impossible to stomach. This book is to Flanner (and Henry Miller, too) what those cheesy General Mills International Coffees are to real cappuccino. Get the real stuff instead!"
2,Misunderstanding the French yet again,"This book is in a long line of books about why France is hard for non-French people to understand. There have been much better ones, especially the one by Ted Morgan whose real name was Sanche de Gramont. Adam Gopnik is a clever writer for the New Yorker and that is his problem. He thinks that since he was in Paris with his wife and young son and also had another child there he might have some especially fetching things to say about the French. He doesn't. I spent two years in France with a young child and know that he is pretty banal about it all.The French are interesting and infuriating. To do them justice requires a writer more interesting than Gopnik."
1,Few islands of humor in a sea of pretense,"I too was suckered in by the praise this book received. In retrospect, I realize that the praise must have come from the author's boorish book critic friends and others so enamored of themselves that they find the work appealing.Mr. Gopnik is of above-average intelligence. Apparently, however, he feels compelled to prove this fact to us, through constant obscure references that very few people will get. Often, the book reads like a poor attempt at creative writing by a show-off college freshman.As an American who formerly lived in Paris, steps from the Luxembourg Gardens, I thought that the book would really speak to me. Unfortunately, Mr. Gopnik worships the same type of pretensions I learned were unappealing after a few short months in the city of light. I too finished the book, always waiting for it to get better. Newsflash; it doesn't.Don't waste your time with this one."
1,fatuous smug navel-gazing,"Adam Gopnik went to Paris on The New Yorker's coin. His kids like Barney, despite his best efforts at censorship. He had to practice cab rides to an exclusive maternity hospital in the suburbs. He ruined dinner for Alice Waters because he was too preoccupied with the Starr report arriving on his fax machine. If this interests you, then buy this book. Does it matter that it was set in Paris? Gopnik could have written similarly self-absorbed and banal insights from a plush Westchester suburb. His relentless insertion of personal detail into every paragraph turns the book's focus from life in the City of Light to the preoccupations of a neurotic bourgeois. An all-too-common example of the ""me"" journalism of the '90s."
2,Rough Read,"If you appreciate a sprinkling of French that you're assumed to understand and a ton of self-absorbed New Yorker-style reflections, this book is for you. He makes many excellent observations (earning him a second star), however, I constantly found myself flipping ahead to see if he was going to make a point.I heard the author on NPR and enjoyed every word that he said. He is capable of getting to the point. It's just ashamed that he isn't as well written as he is well spoken.I encourage anyone thinking of purchasing this book to carefully read all the reviews and consider whether this is for you."
5,I have savored this book,"I have never read anything which made me repeatedly laugh out loud over and over like this book did. And it was filled with many interesting insights into cultural things I am interested in--food, politics, etc. He also has a wonderful dry sense of the absurd. Will remember the Regiment Rouge and department store ""theme"" music for some time to come."
5,A Really Fun Read,"Adam Gopnik originally published these insightful and funny essays when he wrote from Paris for ""The New Yorker."" In general, his voice in these essays shows both amusement with the French and great admiration for their everyday culture. Here's a quote that captures the point of view of this wonderful book, as well as Gopnik's direct and elegant style. ""Paris is marked by a permanent battle between French civilization, which is the accumulated intelligence and wit of French life, and French official culture, which is the expression of the functionary system in all its pomposity and abstraction...There is hardly a day when you are not wild with gratitude for something that happens in the small shops...And hardly a day when you are not wild with dismay at something that has begun in the big buildings, some abstraction launched on the world in smug and empty confidence."" Highly recommended."
3,Beware product mix-up,"There was a problem with (Amazon's?) indexing of this item, which caused the wrong toy to be sent. Purchasers should call the seller to make sure they have ordered the right toy."
3,"Nice content, but not nicely written","~~~~~Contents are pretty good and updated and the examples are found to be very useful.However, the book is not well written and organized. Some expressions can only be understood by the authors themselves. The readers have to be prepared to spend much more time than they expect to figure out some minor details. Examples lack of step-by-step description. Important details are either missing or skipped in many places, assuming the readers are super-mathematicians.The book is, I would say,~~ out of a rush-to-publish job. Looking forward to 2nd Edition, if there is one.~"
2,"Loved it, until ... Win7 x64","I loved this monitor when i was still using Vista x64 and the HD4870 graphics card. It took a while to have them supported but the 2.0.0 software of the included calibration device finally did. Now on Win7 x64 and HD5870, it simply refuses the monitor as it claims it's not supported (seems to think it's a different monitor). No way around this and Samsung is notoriously bad for supporting older models. So, it still works as a regular monitor, but calibration is now bricked and no way to get it back. That makes the color accuracy (the whole point for the XL series) a non-feature. I wish the software would allow to calibrate anyway, even if the current configuration is not in the list. Especially when it SHOULD work but doesn't because apparently some code is not updated!I have no confidence Samsung will step out of their shadow on this one. Support is likely to be permanently outdated."
4,Iron fist is underrated series,Iron Fist is a low level Marvel Superhero. His first series was 11 issues of Marvel Premiere followed by a 15 issue series bearing his name and ending with two issues of Marvel Teamup. They are all in this volume plus Power Man 48-50 which laterbecame Power Man and Iron Fist. The stories are full of action and the art is suprisingly good especially the action scenes. The Claremont Byrne stories are the best in the volume and the weakest are the three issues of Power Man which initiates the partnership between the two heroes but that is largely because of poor reproduction of those stories. A solid collection of stories and underrated. If you like martial arts get this book
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Lost Horizon meets Kung Fu by way of the Marvel Universe. Iron Fist is a blast. Definitely one of the better Essentials. This is top of the line superhero and martial arts and other craziness. There is also corporate conspiracy and intrigue, and dodgy looking ballet booties on his costume, according to some writers! A definite bargain."
1,Circular Saw Cutting Guide,"When rough cutting, a good craftsman can follow a pencil line. An accurate straight cut requires a straight edge clamped to the material to be cut. This items attempts to shortcut that process and just doesn't work.Because it's a one item fits all device, it first has to be cut to fit your circular saw. The problem is that it has a minimal edge to support the circular saw when starting the cut, so you frequently start off in the wrong direction. Despite its being made from plastic, there was a lot of friction between it and my saw. which caused the whole unit to shift, making cuts less than perfect. My freehand cuts were just as good as cuts made with this device.Sears makes an item that is both cheaper and more useful.[...]They used to make a table that converted a circular saw into a 45/90 miter saw, that I bought 30 years ago."
1,"It doesnt fit all 8 1/4"" and smaller circular saws.....","It doesnt fit all 8 1/4"" and smaller circular saws.....other then that, iam sure it would of worked fine...."
3,Not exactly what it was...,"I own two of these. The one i bought last year was ""Made in the USA"", and was perfect. The one I just received was ""Made in Taiwan"", and IT SHOWS. Cheaper plastic...worse molding...half imprinted marks that show the outline of the stamp...etc... The worst is that it is bowed 1/2"" across the piece...fortunately in the direction that doesn't affect the accuracy, but still... THIS IS NOT WHAT IT WAS. BOO FOR BENCH DOG."
3,Works Good but watch out its brittle,"I managed to snap of the lower right hand corner, but enough of it is still in tack to use it."
1,Terrible application,"I started using this glitter spray tonight before my base paint was fully dry. I decided to wait a little longer to apply the glitter. Four hours later I came back to the same bottle of glitter paint and it was clogged and would only shoot paint a few droplets at a time. I had to hold the can three inches away from my project to get the paint on and I could only apply it in globs. What a waste of money. It doesn't matter if you read the instructions, which I did and followed. The tip/applicator is not right for the paint formula."
5,entangling vines,"Not a book for the novice, but an outstanding and valuable academic reference for the reader of koan works. a serious book for the serious zen adept. Difficult to find but available from the publisher in Japan. reviews and comments on the author by searching the web."
2,Too complicated.,"I am a freshman in high school, and this is my textbook in my AP European History class.The events depicted are often out of order, making it harder to understand the timeline. The writing seems inconsistent, sometimes short and understandable but often is long-winded and unclear. The authors of this book assume you have some knowledge of both of the geography in Europe and at least some knowledge of Europe's history already. In most of my fellow students' case, they assume wrong. If you do not already have some experience in studying Europe, then I would recommend searching for a different book."
3,Not the greatest but okay.,"I am a sophmore in highschool. This is my textbook for my AP European History class. It is a very hard book to analyze do to misplacement of chapters. For example, the Scientific Revolution is in chapter 14. The Enlightenment, (which should have come next), isn't for another 5-10 chapters. Also, they aren't clear about who did what. All in all though, it does give the information across fairly clearly."
4,Game worked well,"Sometimes you have to be cautious ordering old used games, but this game cam as described and worked very well."
4,Page turner,A well paced story that keeps the level of suspense high throughout. One of very few books that I wanted to read cover to cover in a single sitting. I look forward to Mr. Lutterman's next literary contribution.
5,Neo Leaf Tonic,Great stuff. Scalp feels wonderful upon application. Wife says my hair has a pleasant aroma and looks darker. Recommend this product and will purchase again.
4,Very Helpful,This book is very helpful and full of information. My husband and I are renewing our vows next year and this book is a great resource.Warning: The conversion to Kindle was very sloppy! Full of typos.
4,"Rigorous, important and insightful compendium of essays","The Baha'i faith is the most recent of the world's monotheistic religions. In its promotion of supranational form of global governance, sexual equality, racial emancipation and socio-economic justice, its teachings contain elements that are both novel in a religious context and replete with ethical implications. However, the religion's relative youth ensures that to date, little secondary literature attempting a sophisticated synthesis of these norms exists. Search for Values: Ethics in Baha'i thought is an important step in plugging this gap. Despite the diversity of the themes addressed, the various essays are unobtrusively, but effectively, linked. This is a high-quality publication which should inspire many others of this type."
5,helped explain a disturbing phenomenon,"this is a book that ALL OF US who grew up in the era of ""kind hearts and gentle people"" should read! these killings are so bizarre that they defied understanding prior to reading dr. smith's book. perhaps if we would ALL tell the truth and do the right thing (when in doubt, DON'T) we could help change our society for the better and concurrently set a better example for younger (pre-geezer) people. congratulations for dr. smith's brave venture into this disturbing situation."
3,Wooden Blade,"Blade: Black and White is a compilation of early appearances of you guessed it: Blade. We is a globetrodder, who is quiet the lemon (thats a 70's joke see Wikipedia). Ok, sorry thats like this is an opinion. I think that the movie version of Blade is allot more interesting than the source material. I hear that efforts have been made to make Blade more appealing in the pages of Captain Britain and MI13, but I digress. The artwork is beautiful, but the action and storytelling is wooden. It is cheaper than buying a new comic at $3.99, Hence 3 out of 5 for art and economy."
5,I actually laughed out loud!,"I like books that contain weird things that happen to people and this book fit that catagory perfectly. Some of the things the book contained made me laugh, others made me cringe, and some made my hair stand up. Also the stories did not drag on as some do, but it went right to the point in good detail. All in all, the book was great! I enjoyed it very much."
3,or buy a Melitta plastic cone for $2 - $5,"This is a lovely coffee maker, but too expensive for some of us. Melitta plastic cones hold similar paper filters and cost about $2 to $5, depending where bought. Melitta produces the same wonderful coffee. Melitta and Hugo Bentz patented the paper coffee filter in 1908, perhaps before Dr. Schlumbohm was even born."
3,Cracked from hot water on second use,On second use of Chemex the glass cracked as hot water was poured over the grounds. Forgot to contact company right away and they said there is no warrenty on glass for their products. Obviously you have the 30 day Amazon warrenty but unfortunately I did not start using it for a while after purchase. Recommend using right away to make sure that there are no defects in the glass. I gave another as a gift and that is still working although it is somewhat of a nuisance because it doesn't work as well without Chemex brand filters. With other filters is tends to spurt up as it does not vent.
5,Great hand dripped coffee,"Chemex drip coffee carafe is simply awesome. I like strong coffee but at the same time I never liked the bitterness. Chemex solved my problem. Because of the funnel effect during the brewing process the coffee gets a sweet brown sugar like taste. You can actually smell the brown sugar like scent while brewing. I was surprised how different the coffee tasted using this product. Yes, it takes more time and effort to make a good hand dripped cup of coffee. I also had to buy additional stuff (scale, hand drip kettle) in order to properly make hand dripped coffee. But if you are a coffee drinker once you've seen the difference there is no going back. I never use my electric coffee maker anymore. Try it yourself."
5,Chemex Drip coffee carafe 6 cup,"Design of the carafe is beautiful, attractive. I gave it as a gift to someone already interested in it. I do think it is somewhat overpriced."
4,good coffee,"Makes excellent coffee, easy to use. I wish there was a way to filter coffee without having to use a new filter every time. Still an excellent coffee maker."
5,"Love it, getting another as a gift","I am an avid tea and coffee drinker. I dislike the taste of stainless steel and plastic in my beverages. I've used this to make about 10 pots of tea. You can use conical filters or even tea bags with this if you are careful. Here's the steps1. Put about 3-4 tea bags or coffee in a conical filter into the Chemex.2. Bring about a quart of hot water to a boil with an electric kettle.3. Slowly pour water over the tea or coffee.4. empty the Chemex into a separate glass picture.The wood is decorative and acts as a heat resistant handle.You could easily store and dispense out of this, but then you'd have to use a bottle brush to clean it.It's a simple design that's been around a while. But there's also no moving parts to wear out. Glass is easy to clean and it doesn't impart any off tastes in your coffee or tea."
4,Great brewing system with a few flaws,"This brewing system provides the best at home brewed coffee. However, the wood needs to be removed each time you clean or it could start to rot from exposure to water. The glass also seemed fragile as my ring hit the edge and suddenly broke the glass. We are now going to try the Chemex with the glass handle instead."
5,OMG,Oh. My. God.A perfect cup of coffee on my second try. The first cup was too weak. I learned to use more grounds with a medium setting on my grinder.That is all.
3,Pretty good,"The product itself was very good because the lettering and numbers were all sewn on. The material was pretty stretchy to fit peoples form but there were pretty decent sized gaps in the weaving. the size however was about three times too big. I ordered a small with length plus two and I got a large with length plus two. All in all, the product was acceptable but the length was a bit unfortunate."
3,"Not Cajun, or Creole, but Chicago","This cookbook is not for those familiar with Louisiana cooking. Instead of complex layering of flavors, this Chicago cookbook opts for hot in everything. You won't find delicacy in the recipes, you will find lots of cayenne.Evidently, Bannos is not that familiar with true Louisiana cuisine, and the food at his restaurants confirms this.Now, being from New Orleans, I have the disadvantage of expecting what Bannos calls ""jambalaya"" to taste like what I know as ""jambalaya"". As such, instead of judging his dish on its own merits, I am comparing it to the traditional dishes.Check out Paul Prudhomme if you want authentic Cajun and Creole."
4,New Orleans meets the rest of the World!,"The Heaven On Seven Cookbook is a must have for any lover of Cajun/Creole cooking. Jimmy Bannos puts together a very interesting list of recipes matching traditional New Orleans fare with elements from other parts of the U. S. and the world. The recipes themselves are not too complex (but are somewhat time intensive), and the ingredient lists are very lengthy at times. Bannos is big on spices, so tamer palettes may need to modify some recipes. All in all a great cookbook though, and a good addition to any kitchen library."
3,Italian Progressive,"""Le Notti Di Salem"" (2000) is the third album from Abiogenesi, and is the weakest of the three that they have produced. Their albums have steadily declined in quality from their excellent self-titled debut through a strong sophomore effort (""Il Giocoscuro"") and now to a decent but far from outstanding third release. A couple of the pieces (""A Salem"" and ""Z.A.W."") have a heavier sound to them, which is fine but it doesn't carry through to the rest of the album giving it an uneven feel overall. Patrick Menegldo is missing from this album; he is replaced by Marco Cimino (mellotron, organ, flute, harpsichord and vibraphone). The rest of the group remains the same with Toni D'urso (vocals and guitar), Sandro Immacolato (drums and percussion), and Roberto Piccolo (bass). There are several guest musicians on the album: Gigi Veneconi (guitar), Clive Jones (vocals, flute and keyboards), and Kevin Brooks (keyboards)."
4,excellent if you dont collect d&c,excellently produced book although if you have the mags you have most of the stuff in it
2,"Great idea, but you can get it cheaper","A swivel head for the faucet like this is a great idea if you don't have a separate sprayer nozzle on your sink but you want to be able to spray the water around. I have one and I use it to rinse out bowls, rinse out the sink itself, etc. But this particular seen-on-TV model is a bit expensive. The one I have is theDanco 88270 360-Degree Swivel Aerator and Sprayer, Plastic, Chrome/Whitewhich goes for half as much and works fine."
5,Great sprayer for low pressure,"Our low water pressure makes for faulty kitchen sink faucet operation. Most end sprayers have a restricter which makes it worse. After looking through all the ""Made in China"" junk on the market, I came across Ultra Eurojet at Bed , Bath and Beyond. It's like I have new plumbing. It's all brass, quality built and operates very smoothly. The slide from spray to aireate is easy and the double joint is very smooth. It's a pleasure to use."
5,Kitchen Sprayer,"Might be a little ""pricey"", but well worth it! The other ones only lasta few months, and are flimsy. This one is very robust."
2,I agree with Thierry -- it wasn't so great.,"Yes, yes, and yes, I had the same problems as Thierry Hansard: it was always hard to pull from stream to spray, and it didn't reset for very long. There was often leakage from the joints. Soooo, after less than a year, I'll take Thierry's recommendation and try the Elkay aerator."
3,2 year lifespan,Length:: 0:21 MinsThis is a nice little addition to your sink when you don't want to spring for a faucet with a built in sprayer. Mine lasted for 2 years until the plastic mechanism that holds the faucet in one position or the other stopped working. Others have posted reviews noting a similar failure. See the video for the example.
2,"good design, bad materials: doesn't last due to fragile o-ring&plastic joint at swivel","good design, bad materials: doesn't last due to fragile o-ring&plastic; joint at swivel.almost all plastic; sometimes hard to pull from aerator setting to spray setting, which gradually weakens the swivel's o-ring seal, will not re-set properly or for very long (i.e. the problem returns). I bought five for multiple sinks and friends, am now on my third one in 8 months. I recommend the getting one with a stronger swivel joint and a gentler release on the aerator-to-spray mechanism, such as:ELKAY LK371 Adjustable Swivel Faucet Aerator or Danco 36325B Swivel Aerator and Sprayer, though the second one uses plastic too, hence the lower price."
3,"Excellent about UML, not much about ""executable""","I was disappointed with this book because there is nothing here about UML action language or constraints. That's what I thought ""executable"" meant, but I obviously got something wrong.The book is the best I have read class modeling, though. If you want to learn practical UML modeling, I strongly recommend this book."
1,"If want to learn about XUML, definitively is not the book!","I bought this amazing labeled book ""Executable UML"", but its contents is a deception, at least. The author didn't respect the book title, filling the book with a lot of uml basics concepts. The most adequate rating for this ""book"" is not zero star, but a black hole, to preserve it far..far way from us."
4,"Good, straight-forward approach","The approach outlined and exampled many times throughout the book is a must for any manager or management team member. The approach can be used in just about any situation where changes must be made to behavior or decision-making to drive toward meeting expectations. It really drives toward asking many questions to gain better understanding. After seeing the talk by Bodaken on UCTV, I was curious enough to buy the book. I surely have gained some insight to better handle many situations in the workplace and outside the workplace."
4,Simplistic praticality.,"The focus here is on increased performance, follows a clearly defined objective with an equally clear road map on how to accomplish that objective. THE MANAGERIAL MOMENT OF TRUTH begins by explaining just what a managerial moment of truth is, and then introduces the acronym MMOT that is used throughout. MMOT is a process that includes identification that what was asked for of a workforce is not what was delivered and the resulting decision of what to do about it.Author's Bodaken and Fritz introduce, and give working examples of a four-step method that is highly usable in the workforce due to its' simplicity and the ease of seeing what works and what doesn't. Throughout, the book stresses the importance of truth in the work place. Overall, well written with practical advice."
5,I Coudn't disagree more with the other review,"The Book was an absolute pleasure to read, especially from a person that was actually there. I can not understand why any negative comments would be generated about this entertaining book. Sounds like someone had an ax to grind!"
3,Harriman the railroader - used book purchase,"The book itself is full of arcane detail, more than I would have expected. Dry, and not as informative about the personal life of the subject, rail icon Harriman. The purchase itself went fine, as the volume is obviously an under-used (if ever) library book."
1,Test questions not representative of actual LSAT,"I used this book to prepare for the LSAT, and do not believe it provided questions as dificult as I actually encountered.The reading level required on the actual test was higher, using more sophisticated language and requiring more subtle discrimination in selecting the correct answer.The actual test's analytical reasoning section (i.e., ""games""), was also more dificult than this guide prepared me for. In particular, two of the four were of a type not described in this book. The clues also tended to be more complex, and included more nested provisional statements.I recommend you find something else to prepare with."
4,A Great children's book for dog loving families.,This book has beautiful Illustrations and tells a delightful story highlighting the differences between two dogs that look alike. I recommend it!
4,Assembly required- find a template first,"These sheets work great for wall sanding, but are slightly different than the Porter Cable pads with the centers cut out (shown in the picture). No template or instructions were included. I now realize that the hook-n-loop pads are different because you don't have to have a center hole thru which to tighten the hold-down. You tighten the pad onto the machine and then just exchange the sanding paper over the hole. This up is the best way to go for wall sanding."
1,Never rcvd it and per your info the product was not availb. in the stock,I never rcvd it and hope Amazon refunded my charge.the product was not availb in the stock.!!!!!!!!
4,My wife loves it.,A lot of product for your money. My wife and I are very happy. I would recommend thi for anyone who is into homeopathic medicine.
2,What can I say?,"Compared to other remedy kits, this one is priced very well. The tablets dissolve easily and taste slightly sweet making them super-easy to give to children. So why the two stars?I took a class and read books on Homeopathy before I put his remedy chest to use. I used these remedies in accordance with what I learned and in some cases under the guidance of more experienced homeopathic users. All in all I saw no effect of these medicines on the ailments of my son or my wife and I. It was a complete waste."
1,"Save your hard earned money, buy sugar pills instead.","I got this box of homeopathic medicine from a friend who bought it and found it did nothing. I used it for a high school science project by taking every pill in front of the entire class then proceeding to finish my entire presentation on the bogus claims of homeopathy. I suffered nary an ill effect. Sure the placebo effect can be perfectly effective for most people, but it's absolutely wrong for a company to charge this absolutely ludicrous amount of money for sugar pills. Go to a pharmacist and ask for a bottle, it'll save you hundreds and have EXACTLY the same effect on the receiving party if they're vulnerable to the effect. It works especially well on children.I see some negativity towards my review... Honestly, if you have some evidence for the efficacy of homeopathic remedies I am definitely open to reading them. Reply with some well-researched information or some links."
5,Excellent support for CST practitioners,This was an excellent support for my work with infants. It gives many practical suggestions and insights. The pictures are phenominal!!!
1,Not really helpful,Pictures and words do not really clarify the steps of the treatment he gives the baby client. It doesn't really help to go deeper in treating craniosacrally babies and children.
5,NUMERO UNO,"yeah, Zoe make you wish your corazon was atomico. very anglo in style (it's often more interesting when artists from Latin America can insert some of their own musical tradtions into their musical style) but there is beautiful imagery in the lyrics and the songs get stuck in your head. i recommend it to anyone who might enjoy rock en espanol or brit pop, with a Mexican twist. i've had it on constant repeat for months."
5,Great Band!,"I had previously dismissed spanish rock, boy was I wrong. this is best music i have heard in years, english or spanish! Great Band!!!"
5,Really fun!,"Probably if they would start the crazy castle numbers over againWoody woodpeckers would be alot like this one. Yousamite sam, Daffy duck,Sylvester and Wily coytoy have kidnapped bugs bunnys girlfreiend Honey bunny. Bugs bunny has to collect all 8 carrots in every level and avoid all the badguys."
3,Feeder birds without page turning,"This is more or less a rehash of the peterson field guide. It has the same (enlarged) pictures that are in the original guide. In addition, it has the type of food that each bird is likely to eat as well as the range map next to the description. I suppose it's a little convenient to have all the feeder birds grouped together, but , other than that, I felt disappointed with the book. There was some (but not enough) information on actually attracting birds and setting up feeding stations. Personally, I found the Stoke's guide to attracting, identifying and understanding feeder birds to be more helpful."
5,perfect for the amateur,"Ordered this after reading all the online reviews...turned out to be perfect to place by our kitchen window as a ready reference guide to the multitude of winter guests just outside. Pictures are easy to follow, the book adds to the fun of winter feeding. No, not a professional or in-depth resource, but great fun for those of us who want a handy, easy to read guide."
4,Good book for beginners,"This thin, well illustrated paperback is printed on heavy glossy stock that reproduces the vivid colors and fine details of the birds. It is too big to fit in a pocket(6.5""by 10.75"")and the use of large type and range maps leaves no room for written descriptions. Contains good additional information on types of feeders and feed, common problems and a bird checklist."
4,Good reference,"My wife and I have this book. True, it could be a little larger, but it will fulfill most peoples' curiosity of what to call the birds at their feeder."
1,MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT...,"I was so excited when I saw Katie Melua with a new DVD produced in 2011! Couldn't wait to see her perform in a raw version with a orchestra backing.There is no 'THE HOUSE' material at all. No Guy Chambers as well. Audio is in PCM (can you believe). Shot in basic 480 or 720 video at best.Katie, you could have at least done one song ('The Flood' maybe) from your current and best album ever. More so, why bring in a major orchestra and offer the audio in PCM.I doubt I'll play it a second time."
3,Too small,Blanket is super soft and snuggly. The only problem with it is it is so small cannot swaddle baby with it. Also doesnt leave a lot of room for baby to roll around or play on
3,"Looks great, but can you use it?","I had been wanting to get a blanket like this, but it was $50-$60. When I saw this for under $25, I thought it was too good to be true. It was.The Good: I really liked the feel, look and texture of this blanket. It's incredibly soft!The Bad: Be warned that it is a LIGHTWEIGHT blanket, best used for spring or summer. Also, it is very small. This blanket is almost not functional.My advice would be to pay the extra money and get the bigger, better blanket."
2,not great,it is too small. it is a waste of time to me and for the money you don't even get to really use it.
1,tough game,this is another tough gane not too exciting but my nephew likes it so I gave it to him.I wish the graphics were more like the nes bataman
1,terrible,"this book sucks. i doulbly regret it, bec i bought one for my girlfriend too! to be fair i havent finished the book, but thats bec of how bad it was."
5,Thank you to The Love Coach!,"This is a great book that I wish was around when I was still single. I spent so many years reading relationship books that were more about healing and self-examination, when really what most single women need are tips on how to look for a mensch (regardless of your ethnic or religious background!) Robin's practical tips and real-life anecdotes let the reader know that there's nothing wrong with HER because she's single- she just needs a little guidance on how to meet her mate! What a gift!"
2,Wanted the game... crappy game!!,"So I love playing this game.. one of my FAVS!!!However, I bought one copy from this seller and I get into level 2 and it has problems!!This is just like playing a DEMO!!I am SO PISSED!!"
1,BattleToads? NO WAY!!,"Definitly a game to skip, the plot [is bad]. You can't find codes for it. The 2nd level is impossible. You could definitly spend your money in a better way. Nuff said."
4,There was a brow raised.,"I was questioning the game when i bought the 2nd copy and it got stuck on level 2 in the same spot on both copies, soon i realize, the retro duo for the nes and snes, i dont know if its the ninto part of the console or the game itself but i found out through other users as myself strugling to play this on the retro duo concole, so dont think its your game cause it may not be, i still like the fact that i own a copy, its a classic anyway, thanks."
1,Kindle version has bad typography,"I bought the Kindle version of Woodford's book (I have physical version). The Kindle version is barely readable. The formulas are pasted as images. Text formulas are either italics, or graphic images, or weird attempt to do LaTeX coding. The inline formulas contain errors.Do not buy kindle version. It is simply awful."
5,Meditation? Yes!!!,"Very slow! The jewel in my collection, in the top five! Excellent sound!What about the other CDs in this series?, I would like to get your feedback!"
3,"If amazon supplied half stars, I'd add one here.","For me the fascination is watching this film as a precursor to ALL ABOUT EVE. Dan Tobin in George Sanders' role, Leo Genn even physically resembling Gary Merrill a bit, etc. Leon Ames never looked better (also with physical hints of Merrill but with Hugh Marlowe's rakish coif). Roz didn't seem right for the part at first, but she handles it well as the plot continues to parboil. But it's also fun to pick out other familiar faces in the cast, including an Apple Annie newsie who'd all but stolen BORN TO KILL from Claire Trevor (fine and wrought here as always) the previous year."
5,Nice price!,"My daughter is only 3, so she missed out when the earlier Barbies and DVD's came out. I was able to find the DVD's, but not the dolls for Rapunzel, Nutcracker, and Swan Lake until I saw these. Not only are they less expensive than the originals but they don't include the extra's that people were complaining about. (I read the old reviews.) My daughter doesn't know the difference! The extras that do come with the barbies include a tea set and small barbie size stuffed animal pertaining to the movie. Each tea set is different.If your daughter is just getting on the barbie ride, these should catch her up at a good price!"
4,"Beautiful Barbie, gorgeous hair!","This barbie is one of my daughter's favorites, along with Princess Anneliese (Princess and the Pauper), and the Happy Family ones. This one has very long gorgeous hair that my daughter loves."
2,New Barbie's have bigger heads!,"The fact that Mattel has changed the head size and shape is not really apparent from the Amazon pictures, but obvious when the package is in hand. This seems to be true of all 2005 issue dolls but not those marketed in 2004 (such as Princess and the Pauper). The new bigger heads don't seem to be a problem for my 6 and 3 year olds, but I don't think these dolls are as pretty as the original size/shape. (...) The 2004 Barbie Rapunzel comes with a small stuffed dragon instead of the tea party set. FYI: this seems to apply to all 2005 issued Barbies. These dolls are just not as pretty as those we had before."
3,"I guess I should of read height,by the picture I assumed it was a lifelike size(didnt know tea party size) but its cute anyway",The doll is fine just another regular barbie although I seen it at walmart (...).Looks can be deceiving it is not a life like or large doll its a regular size old barbie NOTHING TO SPECIAL OR IMPRESSIVE IF YOU ASK ME>>
5,"Not easy, but great!","I highly reccomend this book to anyone who has a background in linguistics and can appreciate its systemic-functional perspective. It is also good for students who want to understand the language as a whole, rather than learning its rules one by one without fully grasping their function within the general structure. Students would need to be guided though, since this book requires a very analytical reading."
3,Bad grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware,"This grammar text makes a mess of the past perfect (past tense, perfect aspect to linguists, which the authors are). It is an important tense and should not be overlooked, but you will have to go elsewhere for enlightenment, to something written by grammarians instead of linguists, who have totally different interests than do people wanting to learn English grammar in a usable form. Buyer Beware.Surely ""A Customer"", (why are you hiding?), who wrote a 5-star accolade is not looking at the same book, or maybe he/she doesn't want to know about the past perfect, which is a useful device. The partial text referred to is sufficiently garbled to cast doubt on the rest of it. I didn't read it all and I don't intend to read it all. Is their no editorial review or peer review in the grammar-teaching industry?"
5,Outstanding fence for router/shaper tables,"I bought this fence to use on my Grizzly shaper to give me aflexable way to route different board widths. The fence thatcame with the shaper/router did not move away from the bitsenough to do all my end shaping work. The bench dog was a perfectchoice because it would clamp down to the cast iron table (which isnot flat on bottom) in a very secure manner. Also the bench doghas tracks to utilize guards, feather boards, etc. This fence iswell built and with the flexability it gave me, I rated it 5 stars!!"
2,Not so special,"I enjoyed the series and didn't know of this episodeI bought it and watched it and decided, ""That's it?""It's alright if you're into the series, but otherwise leave it where you find it."
3,It's okay!,"Thought for 25th anniversary they would give it a little more!But as I was a fan of the show, it was nice to have another episode!"
2,Disappointing,"This silver Wedding anniversary edition gives the viewer the impression that it was written by a pepetually angry 10 yr old. While the acting was as it was back in the ""old days"", the story line was just silly and even annoying. Not at all like the regular series that ran years before this publication. Too bad they didn't hire good writers with more imagination and maturity."
2,So disappointing!,"When I heard that this DVD was out I ordered right away as I enjoyed the series years ago. I was very disappointed, however, as I felt there was too much bickering. There is enough trouble and disagreement in the world today without incorporating it in to what could have been a lovely cap to the series."
3,Good but slightly disappointing,"We watched the entire series and purchased it on DVD as soon as it was available so when I saw the Silver Wedding Anniversary show we couldn't wait to watch it.Seeing the original characters/actors after all this time was truly a treat but we found the story for this special to be disappointing. The disaagreent between Audrey and Richard was contrived, to say the least and why introduce a new central character, the nephew (played well by Alexander Armstrong) and not give him anything to do other than being ""eye candy""?Minor points certainly and we still enjoyed see our old favorites together again but it could have been better."
3,To The Manor Born: Silver Wedding Anniversary,"I expected the same quailty of humor in the amicable tension that occured between the main characters in the original series (circa late 1970's). I was disapointed. While the 25th anniversary special was enjoyable and I DO NOT reget purchasing it, I wasn't as pleased with the comedic situations in which the characters were placed. Rather than appearing to be a natural consequence of the character's circumstances, the tension between the main chacters (Audry and Richard) in this 25th anniversary special seemed contrived; therefore, the comedy was less satisifying."
2,It's ok but......,"For waiting 25 years it could have been a bit better. It was good to see the old characters and missed the ones no longer with us. It's inexpensive enough to purchase, but think you may only watch it the once and pass it on. Great ideal, very lackluster execution."
3,Block building for children,"I had heard this book was great for young children, however I didn't read up enough to understand that this book is probably suited better for older children. I teach PreK and was hoping it would show color pictures as well as pictures that were larger. The book has black and white pictures and the pictures are not that large. The book has extensive descriptions and directions for each item. All in all it was an ok book and I still placed it in my block center for the children and they do use it."
4,Problems with Multi-languages,"This product is great, however, it crashes when handling certain unicode issues (chinese in my case). I generally use it for backing up my data onto an external USB hard drive and it has saved lots of time for me. I also notice that it has some problems finding duplicates, because after running the program I still saw some duplicates not found (haven't got the time to find the reason). Also, buyers make certain if you want FolderMatch or FolderClone. After buying Foldermatch, I found out that the Clone was better suited for me becuase it queues up the backup for several drives and it is more like a ""press one button and it will handle all the backup"". Currently, I have to do each drive manually."
2,wrong size and wrong item,"The costume I got is cute. But, it was not the right size, I ordered 0-6 months and received 9-12 months. So, the costume is too big for my baby to wear this Halloween. Not only that, but it wasn't even the costume in the picture. The picture is much cuter than the one I received. It's still a ladybug costume but it's definetely not the ladybug costume in this picture. Extremely misleading!!!!"
4,Great American Choral Works,"I bought this CD for the Navy hymm ""Eternal Father Strong to Save"". I found that there were othr fine songs on it as well (try listening to ""America the Beautiful""). The male chorus has excellent voices and stays in tune.GeorgePasadena, CA"
2,Fun to laught AT this game,"One of the worse Nintendo NES games ever. The interface to each game is archaic, even for NES standards. There's only a handful of casino games you can play. It doesn't matter if you win or lose at the games, there's no ""wining level"" or end to the game, unless you run out of money in which case you can just play again with more money.The only reason I didn't give this game 1 star is because of the music. The intro music is actually pretty sweet- I'd be funny to set it as your ring tone."
4,Fun gambling game,"This is a NES game I really enjoyed. There's several different gambling games, and though nowadays you can get games with more gambling options, Caesar's Palace is a classic and a lot of fun. Personally, I preferred the blackjack, but the slot machines are also fun, and hey, if you lose all your money, at least it's not REAL money. :)"
2,Not for legal size files,Very disappointed that this file cart could not accommodate LEGAL SIZE folders as well. Had to send it back.
2,Think twice before buying.,"2 stars for a well constructed item. Unfortunately, I did not pay enough attention to past reviews. While the Wicker File Cart is well constructed and up to holding a fair amount of weight, it gets low points for having drawers that fall out when opened. Luckily for me, I have sewing in the cart. I put fabric in the top that doesn't weigh enough to propel the drawer open too fast. I have loose supplies in the bottom so when the drawer hits the floor, it hasn't fallen far enough to spill. Can't imagine why this flaw wasn't caught before production. Also, the wicker has a red tone that doesn't show up in the picture. I made this work for me because it is the right size for my needs. If you want this for files, give it some thought."
5,He Amazes Me,"No matter what song, album, or mix Paul van Dyk is creating or performing, he always manages to pull off an excellent job. Spinning those turn-tables and creating a hypnotizing sound of trance and techno, he amazes me everytime a new song or album is released. He works very hard as a Dj and that is shown in his musical performances, and I would love to congratulate him on the great job he has done, he is truly an amazing Dj."
2,average at best,"This T.V. was purchased at Wal-mart after returning a Sanyo which went out after owning it 11 months (Fortunately I was able to return the T.V. per the warranty). This T.V.'s picture, when compared to every other HDTV is poor to average at best. The sound is poor and there is no audio out to take advantage of the digital surround associated with HDTV. The price is low enough to influence a sale, but when it comes to HDTV why skimp on price, buy the T.V. that takes full advantage.Overall this is a fine T.V. if you just want to say that you own an HDTV. However if you truely want to own an HDTV, I recommend somthing else."
4,Enjoying the quality and value of this set.,"I got a good deal on this unit, only 525.00 (I think) from Wal-mart. I did some research and it seem to have what I was looking for in my first HDTV. Philips/Magnavox has been a favorite of mine for a very long time. I have had this set going on two years now and had no problems. It has shown me the major differences between analog and digital signals.I recommend it because for the money, from my experience, you are getting a solid reliable TV with a lot of viewing options.Yes some day I will get a flat panel of some kind, but I'm in no rush as I am happy with this HDTV performance."
1,TV is destined to FAIL.,HDTV picture was nice. It wasn't calibrated correctly so I had to go into service mode to adjust it. Yesterday it died. It is out of warranty after 2 years the TV is dead. A complete waste of 600$
1,Cheap,Received the product with holes and slits in the plastic. Once installed the doors will not zip. Not impressed with this product.
4,TO GOOD TO BE TRUE,"THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE TO THE WORLD , I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU SOME DAY YOU ARE GREAT"
5,Took Me Home,"Dark comedy is pretty common in Iceland, and I've got to say this is actually fairly light. Children's stories in Iceland are darker humor than this. Really, it's not so bad. ;)What I loved about this film is it took me home. My family is from Hafnarfjörur. The sound of the snow crunching under their feet, I could almost taste the pönukukur and the kleinur... Hiding and playing with friends while my Amma was sewing... The stories about the elves in the hills.. running through the lava fields. i can't vouch for the representation of how the rich live, but Agga's life and family definitely took me home.I highly recommend it to other Icelanders."
3,Not great,This was not Ginastera at his best. The recording was good enough but the music was a bit cliche and much less compelling than other works I've heard by this composer.
1,AVOID AVOID AVOID,"The strap that secures this is not strong enough. It will fail rather quickly. A nice idea, but poorly executed. It should be sold with a dozen or more straps. When the one fails, you have nothing but junk on your hands."
2,Picture not accurate at all.,This item is not what is presented in the picture. It is for a SINGLE side attachment rail only. It IS NOT the 3 prong side and bottom rail attachment.2 stars for misrepresentation.It IS the official; Beretta side rail kit. Singular. One side only.
1,Terrible quality of pictures,"just an opinion about quality of manufacturinglooks terrible - like made on copy machine.For this price better quality is expecteddid not read yet ,so will come back"
2,Not so fun,"This tutorial seemed to be written well enough, but as a complete banjo newbie I found it frustrating. It's didn't seem to offer enough variety of learning exercises at each new skill, so that I felt stuck trying to learn the same example over and over. I gave up on this book and bought ""A Manual on How to Play the 5-String Bango for the Complete Ignoramus"" by Wayne Erbsen (...) and I'm now having a great time learning clawhammer style as well as the slides, etc. that seemed so frustrating in Tony's book. Maybe it's better if you have more banjo experience to start with."
1,Faulty seal - do not buy,"The seal has also gone out on two blending heads for me and the company is now sending me a third even though the warranty is slightly over. I highly doubt, however, that it will last more than one or two blendings - that is what happened with the last one. I am disgusted with kitchenaid for selling a product with a very obvious design flaw. I blend mayo, wash up the blending head and then press on the seal and more mayo comes leaking out. Very disgusting! I only discovered this seal leaking recently and I wonder how long this was going on before I made the discovery. I will purchase from another company in the future."
1,"Great design, poor manufacturing","Here I am looking for a replacement immersion blender and, yes, only after a year of use, the unit I bought is now broken. The plastic gasket behind the mixing blades detached, exposing whatever glue they use to attach it. Yuck. Imagine that breaking off mid-meal preparation for company with good food? The AC power wire coming out from the handle/base frayed, despite our carefully wrapping the cord after each use. So to save cost, I'm buying a replacement mixer attachment, and look at the sole review for that: http://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-Immersion-Blender-Blending-Attachment/product-reviews/B000WZY5KY/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending My sentiments exactly.We strongly recommend you look for a different immersion blender, as we will not be replacing this unit with another KitchenAid blender."
2,Worked great...for 18 months,"I purchased the 300 model, which is the 100 but with extra attachments. This was a great hand blender, blending large pots of pureed soup, smoothies with ice, etc. However the coupling stripped from the pin inside the motorized component and it wouldn't spin any of the attachments. It has a one year warranty and sure enough, after 18 mos. it broke. After going back and forth with KitchenAid ""customer service"" the ""best"" they could offer me was to sell me a new motorized component at a discount of 30% which I can still buy $20 cheaper on Amazon. They didn't stand behind the quality of their product and I am thoroughly disappointed. BTW, not surprisingly it was made in China."
5,LOVE it!,"This thing is great... I use it for chopping and grinding nuts, herbs, making smoothies and salad dressings, making hummus, pureeing beans for gravies, etc. It is so easy: plug it in, do your thing, remove the bottom half and give it a quick rinse in the sink. Presto! Clean and ready for your next project. With this thing, I have completely stopped using my countertop blender and my (awful) food processor.I've only had this a few months, but even if it only lasts a year or two (I use it CONSTANTLY), as some reviewers have complained, replacing it is a significantly smaller investment than also eventually replacing the blender and processor. Not to mention this is SO EASY to clean compared to those other appliances, so the time investment is minuscule. That matters to me! :-)Highly recommended!!"
2,Rarely used and it died,"I actually liked this product but didn't use it very often..just to blend/make soups on occasion. I was using it to blend carrot soup where the carrots were all cooked down. It suddenly stopped. I thought maybe it just overheated and set it aside and didn't think anything of it. Then a month and a half later I picked it up to blend and it wouldn't turn on. Tried different outlets to make sure it wasn't the outlet - no, it's the product. Completely dead and it's pretty much brand new!! It's just 2 years old, hardly used (but of course out of warranty)."
2,Not powerful,I was really happy with my blender until I used it to whip butter yesterday and it blew. I would not recommend this for anything but very light jobs like soup and milkshakes.
5,Save Time and Money,"I have been struggling with skincare products and beauty products all my life. Skin is much more complicated than ""Oily"" or ""Dry"". In reading The Skin Type Solution, I was able to find my specific skin type (OSPW...Oily, Sensitive, Pigmented, Wrinkle). Now I know exactly what to buy for my skin. What's also helpful is Dr Baumann's website, drbaumann.com, she continues her service by having a forum for readers to share information and a Q & A section where you may even receive an answer from her personally! I think the book is a great investment and the website is a terrific supplement."
5,Great book!,"I always read reviews for acne products that said ""after years of trying everything I finally have clear skin."" I always thought those were fake reviews because, I myself had acne problems for about 15 years. I have tried everything from birth control pills, accutane, etc. And nothing worked. I just happened to be in Barnes and Noble and decided to buy this book. I took the test and bought the recommended products. It has changed my life. Within two weeks my skin has cleared. My self- esteem has improved. I no longer worry about my appearance and feel like going out more."
4,The Skin Type Solution,An excellent book. It gives you a lot of information. Make sure you take the test in the beginning. I didn't and I was makingwrong decisions until I did take the test. You can save money too. That counts in todays economy.
2,"Interesting ideas, but advice was lacking","I bought this book in desperation to try and improve my acne-prone skin. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, and I was excited to see what the book would tell me. I bought it, read it, and followed the product advice for my skin-type, using the products exactly as she suggested. Within a week, my skin was 80% worse. I had pimples all over my forehead and chin, and my skin was dry and peeling. I continued to use the products and to get the same results for about a month before I gave it up. It turns out that one of the products she listed as her favorite for my skin type was full of acne and irritation causing chemicals. This book is mostly well-written and interesting, with some good healthy habbit advice, but be careful with the products suggested. I got the impression that she didn't really try them, or do any real research on them."
1,The Skin Type Solution: A Revolutionary Guide To Your Best Skin Ever,"There is one huge problem with this book. Dr. Baumann is a paid consultant and advisor to many of the companies whose products she's recommending in this book. The book is a large, paid advertisement. I think Dr. Baumann should disclose in a forthright way all of her industry ties. Otherwise,it's difficult for the consumer to know what's an honest assessment or recommendation for a product and what is great way for her to increase the sales for the products she represents."
3,For those wanting over the counter product references,It is detailed and good advice for over the counter products. Not the best advice for experienced estheticians. Great advice for the general public.
3,"Ok, but mostly info I already knew","I would consider myself a skin care enthusiast. Since I've been going to the dermatologist for 20 years for my oily acne prone skin I am hyper aware of which products I use, what to do with my regimin, etc. So, after taking the multi-page quiz I found it rather anti-climatic to find out that my skin type of oily, sensitive, no-wrinkled, resistant. Then I read the 1 short chapter about my skin type and that was it. so I used about 15 pages out of this rather long book. I did find it interesting the product recommendations she gave for drug store brand products and the list of ingredients to avoid and to look for. But this isn't a book you'll go back to read again."
3,Useful Book,"A good book. While the book appears rather fat a lot of the book is taken up with the test and is then mostly divided into sections for each skin type. So there was less information to get from the book than I'd hoped. I did however find the information there was useful and relevant if not as detailed as I had hoped.I liked whenever she suggested products they were in a range of price points. So many books like this recommend a ""cheaper product"" that starts at something like $50.00 this book does recommend a good range from drugstore all the way up to high end, so there are choices for every budget. Or for those of us just wanting to try out a skin care routine before investing big bucks. Often there were recommendations for the lower priced items too which was a nice surprise.A good book if your current skin care routine doesn't seem to be working, you are sure to get some ideas from this that will help."
2,"interesting premise, but my face ended up worse","I was really sold by the whole concept of this book. I took the quiz accurately and honestly, went out and spent a lot of money on what I thought would be the end all and be all of my acne issues. Nope. The recommendations made my skin significantly worse. I was really disappointed.My other comment is that Dr. Baumann continues to try to ""sell"" you even though you're already reading the book, which makes it sort of an obnoxious read. Throughout the book she boasts her method is the answer to all your problems...but it wasn't, at least in my case."
5,Very helpful information,"After 60 yrs. of living and thousands of $$$$ spent on skincare products, I finally know what type of skin I have! There is a very easy quiz at the start of the book which will tell you what skin type you are (there are 16 types!) and what products work best for that skin type. I can now go to the drug or department stores and buy what I need to keep my skin from breaking out or wrinkling. Dr. Baumann lists many products in each category that you can choose from - they range from the economical to the expensive - and she also lists the stores and/or websites where you can purchase them. She also recommends a daily routine for AM/PM. I highly recommend this book for the younger generations so you don't waste a lot of time & money on skincare that will do nothing for you."
2,"Good analysis, but product recommendation just wield!","As a sensitive skin type, I know I repond badly to clean and clear and several other Johnson and Johnson products. So imagine my surprise when ""clean and clear"" product appeared again and again in the recommendation list for OS** types.Otherwise, this is the first book that acknowledged that oily skin can be sensitive too. The ""beauty bible"" et al basically treat oily skin as brick wall.But the product recommendation is a shame."
2,Disappointing,"This book looked good in the table of contents, but was short on detail. It does provide a good 40,000 foot overview of the topic for those new to the field, but was disappointing for me. I am experienced in Design for Six Sigma and wanted detail in how to apply it in Service. Instead I got an overview of what I already knew about DfSS. It is very similar in approach to Forrest Breyfogle's Implementing Six Sigma. A good overview, but very short on application specifics."
4,Not Bad,"It's very cheap, so I didn't expect good quality. But it's way better than I thought. Quite often if you wear cheap cloths, you look cheap and not nice. But this one I don't look that way at all. I look not bad, and I like it."
1,Awful Customer Service,Shipping was very slow. I returned this shirt (size too small) and haven't heard a thing from the seller. Seemed like a good price and chose to take a look. Would recommend the Dickies shirt for a few dollars more (and quicker shipping).
2,thumbs down!!!!!!!!!!,"it sucks balls!!!!!!!! ok, it curves down and its not automatic!!! the clip is ok and holds 'bout 20 bb's. but one of my batteries had acid all over it and i had to buy another pack at ""Target"". if u buy this and u want to return it, its going to cost u money!!!! wut the hell is up w/ that i dont know! but its gay!!!!! it doesn't even go that far!!! mabye 50 ft max!!!! and its hard to cock back. it was shipped in 3 days, which impressed me very much and the package wasn't damaged at all!! so thats good!!!! mabye the only good part!"
1,BULL SH*T,holy freaking god... this gun blows big time and is not worth the 9 dollars... maybe id buy it at a little girl's lemonade stand if it came free with a cup of lemonade... it sucks so bad and shoots terribly... the kid who said its good for sniping should die and don't listen to the other kids because they cant spell... believe me when i say this gun sucks... it sucks
2,wheel cylinder,I purchased two rear wheel cylinders for my 82 Tercel. When I got the items one of them did not have a plug in the line connection and looked like it was previously installed due to the scapes and rust on it. The other unit was like new.
3,Don't believe the other reviews,"A good cover song is one where the song is not just rehashed to sound like the original but when a band remakes the song in thier own way. In my opinion there are only 5 songs on this album that do that; So Lonely, Walking on the Moon, Murder By Numbers(Bold choice for a cover), Wrapped Around Your Finger and Every Breath you Take. There are a couSo don't listen to the other reviewers with there five stars and there claims original covers. Besides would you listen to someone who claims they listen to The Police and has never heard The Truth Hit Everybody and they think the drumming is better then Stewart Coupland.."
5,One of my favorite bands.,"The Police are one of my favorite bands,and these songs are good and slightly different then the original versions.I like the differences."
4,Policia CD,"Great price, came in great condition, just took a little longer than I thought, but I did send it to a different address than I usually would and it did come within the projected dates"
3,finally these terrible bands pay hommage,"The Police was the greatest band of all time. I am glad to see them finally getting the recognition they deserve. However, these bands are all so bad and their covers could never do justice. Fall Out Boy is the worst thing to hit the radio in years, but I am very happy to see that they know it is important to honors the greats that came before them."
1,Have the producer arrested!,"Jeez, $14 for a bunch of garage bands performing covers of The Police. What a pile of trash! I typically like these types of albums (ie. House of Blues - Tribute to the Rolling Stones), but only when top performers are doing their thing. The performers on the Policia CD are just not that good, and their versions of the songs are worse! Save your money and buy the real deal."
1,"Was not in stock, even though the site said it was IN stock!","Very nice apologetic email, but came too late. Was buying a gag gift for a friend. Site said it was in stock; however, order not fulfilled, as not in stock. Nice emails, but still disappointed."
2,Not impressed.,I should've known better than to order these online. Not the quality I expected nor the fit.
1,Stay Away,"I ordered three of these and NONE of them worked. They performed when plugged into the computer, but failed to hold a charge once disconnected from the PC. This was after the tech-support recommended ""all night"" charging.By way of background, I'm fairly computer savvy, have a new PC based system, and spent hours on the phone with Creative tech support trying to fix the problems. Ultimately, I had to return the units.Stay away."
4,So far so good,"I had an MP3 player before that only lasted a few months before not working anymore. From what I read, this is not unusual. This time I bought the Zen Stone 2GB because of the price and lack of negative reviews. The controls don't always work well, sometimes it switches to radio when not trying, or won't turn on or off easily. Also, it seems like the battery needs charging more often than they say. But it was easy to load the songs from RealPlayer, and delete and add songs. I bought a generic charger from Radio Shack so I could charge it from an electric outlet rather than the computer (for trips). It includes a car charger. This for approx. $30, same as Creative's AC charger. I'm hoping this will be the last MP3 player I have to buy for a long time."
1,HORRIBLE MOTHERBOARD !!!!,"I purchased this mobo on november 30 2007 and received it on December 3 2007. The board preformed semi-flawless until May 11 2008 on that day this Asus product died and after nearly 4 months I'm still getting a run around from Asus customer support. I am now on my ""FIFTH RMA'ed MOTHERBOARD"" and that s*&^%%$#$ doesn't work either. I have replaced EVERYTHING that connects to this board and still it fails. Do yourself a favor and do a google search on this product and find some forums on this product and you will read the same story as mine.I found out too late what type of junk ASUS sells. Run from this board and any other by this company !!!!"
1,Very bad memory support,"The motherboard only accepts a subset of DDR2 RAM banks. For instance, my server class ECC memory is not supported. Moreover, do not expect to find any help on the manual or on the DVD. If you have problems, you must contact the ASUS support service. In my case their solution to my problem is clear: buy new memory which i refuse to do (i have server class ECC RAM!).At the end, i just wasted several hours, i won't buy Asus for a while."
5,My Favorite MoBo,"The Asus M2N-SLI Deluxe is probably my favorite mobo that I have ever owned. Right now i am running Windows 7 Pro. 64-bit, and 8GB of RAM. I have an AMD Phenom II X4 940, three 500GB hard drives, and dual nvidia 8800gts gpu's (sli linked). I have not had ONE single problem with it. When I got this mobo, i originally ran an AMD phenom X4 9500 with 2GB RAM and windows Vista home 32-bit, and was leary on whether the board would accept the upgrades that i made. But everything worked out with no issues. update: 3/17/2012, still running just fine."
1,This Motherboard Failed,I bought this mainboard and send to me a few months ago but only started using it last weekend. Less than 3 days later and it has failed. Hours and hours of frustration and my dream of building my dream gaming rig came crashing down and being an overseas customer support is non existent.It is a good board but that is useless if it does work as it is supposed to!
4,Good value,"This motherboard represents a good value for the dollar. It is being used for a home computer for casual to moderate use. By not pushing the board to its' limits, it is expected to be stable, and perform well for quite a few years The components used in conjunction with it are:- 535 watt power supply, 320 GB HDD, one basic video card, one DVD drive, one ethernet graphics card, and 2 gigabytes RAM; all within an all aluminum case. With two weeks of use under its' belt, the issues have only been minor."
3,Not what Expected,"I thought it would be bigger, was disappointed, its not "" Giant"" and its not really for a vehicle.But it was nice and I enjoy it."
1,Personal Commentary Included,"I found this book to be biased against Hanna. It is quite useless. It's more of an attack on Hanna than anything else. It has personal commentary occasionally throughout the book that ruins the reading of Hanna's achievements, and is not recommended for first time Hanna readers.It is ""flying is my life"" her original book, with added commentary. There is nothing really different. It ruined my Hanna experience."
1,"Sophomorically written, poorly researched, biased","A poor book. Sophomorically written, better suited to youngsters. The author has a poor knowledge of the Third Reich and is heavily biased against Germans of that era. If you are interested in Hanna Reitsch find a copy of her autobiography FLYING IS MY LIFE."
1,Not up to even the loosest scholarly standard,"As other readers have noted, this work is little more than a poorly written and biliously annotated version of Hannah Reitsh's memoir ""Sky My Kingdom"". Anyone with even a passing interest in either the subject or the era (or in good writing in general) would be far better off purchasingSKY MY KINGDOM, THE: Memoirs of the Famous German World War II Test Pilot, which is available here on Amazon."
1,Biased,Most writers write on a subject that they love or they find fascinating but in this case one cannot read this book and wonder if the author wrote an entire book to deliver a backhand blow.
1,Very little use and it's DEAD!,"I got this immersion blender just over a year ago (AKA just out of the warranty period) and I only used it, on average, once or twice a month. Today I went to use it and half-way into the job it sparked, let out a puff of smoke, and died! I have loved all of my other products from KitchenAid, but this is a dud. It was great while it worked, but it's so dissapointing to spend that much money for only a year of light use. I figured it up at about $5-$10 per use. Save your money and buy another brand :("
5,Favorite new appliance,"I'm so pleased with this immersion blender and would highly recommend it to everyone! It works great and it does a better job than my traditional blender, especially with frozen items, such as fruit. Having various speed settings is very useful. Having the other accessories is going to be a great addition to an already excellent product. Clean up is easy and I like the storage bag to keep all the parts neat when put away. I received another one like it for Christmas but without the additional parts(mini chopper,whisk). As soon as I took it out of the box I knew it was well made and decided to box it back up and order the set. Very glad I did!"
1,Linden Living,"I was disappointed in this product. It was really expensive for what we received. The coins continually fall out and the dust is terrible because there is not cover. Very hard to clean without removing all the coins and then putting them all back again. I though this was a sealed unit when I bought it, but it is not. Next time I will buy one that keeps the dust out."
2,What Is It???,"I'm not rating the product, just the description. This is exactly what I need, but nowhere does it say what size of this fitting is. Is it 1/2""? 5/8""? 3/4""? Pointless to buy this without knowing the item size. The indicated package size does not help me."
4,A little downstep of the first game,"What was Bubble Bobble best known for? The answer: It's multiplayer mode.In Bubble Bobble: Part 2 (which is a direct sequel), you can't play onscreen at the same time with your buddy. Co-op multiplayer is something major that built up the series. The fact that you can't do co-op here is inexcusable.However, other than that, this game plays just like the first Bubble Bobble. There is a new float ability, and there are all-new level designs, but the basic gameplay remains the same. Although, that's actually a small complaint, given how the gameplay is already so good."
3,Sparkling and Cheerful,"Yes, I know it's not ""West Side Story"" or ""Cabaret"". Yet, it's cheerful, light-hearted and very nice to listen to. The lyrics are sometimes funny, others sentimental, and both Vivien Leigh and Jean Pierre Aumont come along quite satisfactorily from the singing test. Some songs are quite contagious - such as ""I Go to Bed"", and some others are sweet and delightfully romantic like ""I Know the Feeling"" which Miss Leigh sings beautifully. Not recommended to highly demanding listeners but it will delight those who like unpretentious, simple, rather old-fashioned and catching tunes."
1,Skip,"I didn't find this to be a good workout video. I often felt lost and had to rewind to understand what exercise we were doing next and how to do it. There was poor explanation, you have to learn by watching and then doing. This could take multiple watchings before the viewer understands. I would skip this video, I've used much better ones."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS OR ADVANCED,"ANNOYING INSTRUCTOR, NOT HARD ENOUGH, AND A WASTE OF TIME. NO INSTRUCTIONS ON PROPER FORM OR ANYTHING. KATHY SMITH TIMESAVER LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOSE WEIGHT IS MUCH MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THIS AND IS ONLY 20 MIN FOR THE UPPER BODY 20 MINUTES FOR LOWER AND 7 MINUTE ABS. KATHY YELLS ALOT BUT I THINK ITS FUNNY. I CANT STAND THE ""OH YAH, UH HUH, THATS RIGHT, UH HUH."""
2,Not enough repetition,This video doesn't give the burn for the abs and arms like other videos. The instructor does more of a routine instead repeition of exercises therefore making it ineffective. The only part that I got a good workout was the arm floor exercise even then you have to be careful not to drop the weights on your head (smiles). I'm sure there are better abs and arms workout on the market.
1,"A simple photocopy, not the actual poster..","Do not buy from this seller, i purchased two posters, this and the return of the jedi spanish version and both are simple photocopys not the actual poster. Find a real poster store snd get the real versions."
3,still looking for a better poster putty,"I've tried this in the classroom. It does the job of holding materials to the wall, however, it is too sticky to remove easily."
5,Have worked well so far,"So far these have worked well. We have only used them to hang paper posters and the posters have stayed up with no problem. We had a poster sized puzzle that we tried to hang that was too heavy for the amount of putty we used. We went ahead and just used thumb tacks instead. It's possible that more putty would have held it up just fine, but I'm not sure. We also used this to hold small electric candles in place on our windowsills and it's working like a charm."
1,grease stains ruin the poster,this left grease stains that soaked through to the front side of all of my posters. now they are ruined. those greasy spots are discolored too-- it made the paper look yellowed.
2,"too gummy, too blue","This mounting putty did the trick, but is a little harder to remove than another brand I have tried. It held up all of my Christmas cards very well, but when it was time to take them down the blue goo was a little too tacky for my liking."
2,Not as good as,"Putty is ok but not as good as a product called ""BLU TAK"" not available in USA. This ""Putty "" is a little more STICKY. However it does do the job."
4,Great for hanging posters,"I purchased the Henkel Duck Adhesive Mounting Putty to help decorate my preschooler's room. He is constantly bringing home new artwork from school, and I wanted something that I was comfortable letting him use himself to place his pictures where he wanted them. This was the stuff - it works great for posters and light pictures. I did have a problem with a heavier item, but I'm sure the product wasn't meant for that. It is easy to use, easy to remove, and does not mark white walls."
1,Dont buy this!,My son and his roommate thought this would be good to put up in the apartment instead of nails.This stuff sticks to everything wall and posters.Removing it is like removing old chewing gum.You have to scrap so much that you have to patch the drywall when done.Not a good product unless you like to scrap and repaint when your done.Hope this saves you time don't buy this has to be a better product some where.
2,Doesn't stick to wall (usually) but does leave greasy splotches on posters,"This putty is as good as any other I've tried. Unfortunately, I have yet to find ANY poster putty that doesn't leave a gross greasy mark on posters. It's ""greasiness"" literally oozes through the front of the posters leaving VERY VISABLE & PERMANENT splotches that look like chewing gum has been left on it. EWWWW!Although it doesn't damage the walls...USUALLY...it DOES leave a greasy stain where it was on the wall on matte finish paint THAT WON'T COME OFF (never, ever,EVER!!!).My advice, use the blue ""paint safe"" wall tape (used for painting) on the back of posters to avoid marks on matte painted walls.Use the poster putty on those cheap posters that kids want to change out after 5 months when ""so and so"" celebrity/movie isn't ""cool"" anymore."
4,A bit tough but works,It his putty is a bit tougher than other brands I've used. You have to knead it a lot before using to get it to be sticky. I also need more of it than I've used with other brands. When I hung papers with a small dot like I have in the past the paper fell off the wall within a few days. I added more putty and it's fine now. Only used to hang regular construction paper.
1,utter crap,it doesnt hold posters up for more than a few hours and it ruins the paint on the wall and the poster.you might as well stick up your posters with bubble gum. never again.
3,Great Work,One of the best works on Goliad available. It does show the world the signifigant role that Goliad played in the revolution of Texas.
2,Review Against the Tide,While everyone is giving this book very high marks I am struggling through it for over 4 week's. It is an easy book to put down and ir I didn't pay for it I would'nt pick it back up. I have a like for Japanese history set in this time period but fild the reading and story telling dull. Very difficult to get into.
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I love Japan and have enjoyed all sorts of Japan-related fiction including Memoirs of a Geisha, Shogun, etc. But this book was slow and overwritten in many parts, and I was especially disappointed that a strong woman has to be portrayed with ""too much yang"" in which played itself out in too many manners instead of being a strong woman in her own, feminine right."
1,Yucky YUCK YUCK YUCK -_-,"I did NOT enjoy this book.Interesting cultural aspects aside (that's about all this book is good for) I did not find the protagonist interesting. I didn't cry over her 'keeping her mother here' or whatever she thought she was doing when her mom was cremated and she wished for the smoke to keep rising. I found her a sad person. I mean, just SAD, not in her life circumstances but I just didn't like her, Genji and all aside.It's been a long time since I read this book, and I'm writing by the seat of my pants. I simply DID NOT like this book at all. And I will not ever be reading it again. That's pretty bad for me. o.o"
4,Fascinating peek into the past,"Liza Dalby is not only an anthropologist but a sensitive writer who was able to reconstruct the life of 11th c. Japan with refined precision and delicious details. Add that to the sensitive profile of the writer of the world's first novel, a woman nonetheless, and you have the makings of a terrific story. This piece of historical fiction is filled with informative data about Japanese culture in the Heian period, about Japanese traditions in poetry, about Chinese influences in Japanese culture and daily customs, tasks and foods of the era. All done with a sensitive precision of language and an engaging story line.Ms. Dalby kept herself as close as possible to the facts known about the author of The Tale of Genji. In doing so, she may have compromised the development of her plot and characters surrounding Lady Murasaki. For this, only, I have removed one star, otherwise, this is a very fine novel, which I can recommend without hesitation to many friends."
4,A beautifully written work that draws you in.,"I've always been intrigued with Japanese culture and picked this book up, not quite knowing what to expect. What I found is an entrancing work that completely immersed me in the world of Murasaki. The language Ms Dalby uses brings the images to life...you feel as if you are standing beside Murasaki as she gazes out over her garden, and you feel as if you were taking part in the events of the story. It is simply marvelous."
4,an excellent historical novel,"Liza Dalby manages to bring 10th Century Japan alive in this novel. She brings us the story of Japan's first great novelist. ""murasaki"" was a court lady of ancient Japan who evectively invented the novel in Japan. This story is told from her point of view when her daughter discovers her diary after she dies.If you have any interest in Japanese history or love historical novels based on 'real' people this is one to pick up. The author has created an accurate historical background on a complex world that lasted only a short time, but has had a great influence on subsequent Japanese culture."
2,Really not for reading,"A friend had the book and being interested in Japanese art and the history of Japan and the cover of the book, I bought it. I began reading enthusiastically and would have read and finished the book but I kept setting it down. I went back to the book to read it as I would read a piece of historical poetry. I could not keep reading the book. The Story is a lose interpretation of day to day history among a few characters in the writers focus. There is no character development. The poetry is empty. However, the book that my friend gave me looks real good on my shelf. I gave my own copy away."
2,Not Engaging - Scholarly Style,"I have been trying to get through this book because the topic itself is intriguing. However, the author does not know how to create characters that are interesting and human, nor does she make much use of dialogue. To me, this is really be a collection of poems, descriptions, and historical references, wrapped in the pretense of a novel. A lovely idea, but unsatisfying and disappointing."
5,awesome!,"great performance. great audio. great extras. great visual backdrop on stage. great atmosphere at their home town on new years. this has become one of my favorite dvds, and i was not even that big of a fan. until now that is.outstanding!"
5,Schoenberg Brahms,The CD is excellent. I was especially eager to get the orchester-facon of thepiano quartett by Brahms. Now my wish is brillantly fulfilled.
5,the greatest performances ever recorded,"Hans Swarowsky's Brahms 4th Symphony and also Academic Festival Overture are definitive--the greatest recording ever done of anything. The pulse is steady; the style is dry, even parched, yet full of feeling, an almost mystical compassion in Brahms' greatest symphony, and convincing celebration in the overture. Totally authentic, tightly controlled North German Brahmsian style. Buy it; cherish it; be constantly amazed at this CD. But thin sonics. Buy it for the supreme example of conducting art."
4,Catchy as anything,"When I saw Autopilot Off live, they really impressed me! It's their live performance that made me listen to their music. Even though this release is short cuz it has 5 songs. My favorite song is ""Nothing Frequency"""
4,Five Songs from Autopilot Off to you.,"This EP is a good introduction to Autopilot Off. It's short and cheap and you are bound to leave it in your cd player.""Indebted,"" the most popular song on the EP, is the only real happy and feel-good song on the cd.""Nothing Frequency"" is my personal favorite on this CD. It's the best to sing along with.The rest of the songs, ""Wide Awake,"" ""Exit Signs,"" and ""Long Way To Fall,"" are more pessimistic lyric-wise, but amazingly upbeat music wise. If you love good music, check out Autopilot Off by buying their most recent release, the self-titled EP, or their mind-blowing full length (Looking Up) or split CD with Slick Shoes."
5,Autopilot Off will rock your world,"This ep by autopilot off is honestly the best cd i've heard in an awfully long time. The songs are agressive yet fun to listen to and if you have a rocker in the family this cd will not dissapoint them. The ep has five songs including: long way to fall, indebted, nothing frequency, exit signs and wide awake. My personal favorite is ""indebted"" and i know you'll love it too. If you like this cd, you will also like their other cd ""looking up"" so check them out!"
4,"Autopilot Off ""Autopilot Off""","""Long Way To Fall"" 5/5""Indebted"" 4/5""Nothing Frequency"" 4/5""Exit Signs"" 3/5""Wide Awake"" 3/5Autopilot Off's debut ep is awesome. There isn't a bad song on the album (there are only 5, but still). It is a great introduction for people who want to get into the band, or another great release for fans who only have their full length ""Make A Sound.""Overall rating: Four stars."
5,New Breed of Punk Rawk,"This album will blow all of you punk rawk fans out of the water, whether you are just getting into it, or you wear spikes to prom. Autopilot Off combines melodic guitar work with some of the most powerful lyrics you'll ever hear. Trust me, just give it a chance and you won't regret it."
5,New Sound,"This cd has adds a new twist to the overflowing genre of punk. With its catchy lyrics and unique vocals, this cd makes a great addition to any punk/pop fans collection. From the drums to the bass, they compliment the vocals perfectly brining a unique and fun sound to the airwaves."
4,check 'em out!,Like punk music? Then check out Autopilot Off's self titled EP. You won't be disappointed. :-)
5,completely awesome,"This CD by Autopilot off is freaking amazing! From the first note of the music, it hits you and wants to knock you out, but at the same time makes you tap your foot and sing along. Everyone reading this review, please go buy this cd, it'll be WELL worth it!"
5,Blew me away,"When I bought this cd at warped tour I knew I like APO but when I listened to the cd i was blown away, It starts off with a blast and doesnt let down, If you want a good punk band and a nice surprise get this today!"
5,BEST YET,"Man.....this ep is soo great. I honestly didnt think APO could b any better but i see it now.. great ep, buy it"
3,Motorcitysoul - Did You Expect That?,"The German have been musically colonizing much of the world lately: from Jazzanova's incorporation of Brazilian vibes to Select Cuts' conquering of Jamaican dub. But here's a new one: Motorcitysoul's album DID YOU EXPECT THAT? moves in on Chicago and Detroit house. ""It's On"" is the most obvious example of this, with its soulful vocals, but ""Written in the Stars"" sounds like more traditional downtempo, especially with the smooth jazz guitar line. But the denizens of Chicago needn't worry; Motorcitysoul only extracts certain parts, rather than invading wholesale. ""Take a Look Around"" blends an Inner City-like synth line into a dancefloor-ready groove; ""Let You Go"" adopts a two-step vibe; ""With You `92"" revels in its happy blippery. The final track, ""(You Don't Know) The Blues"" gets down with some smooth tech-house grooves. More of an homage to the Motor City, really, than a takeover."
5,Barns Living in Converted and Reinvented Spaces,"Good book overall if your intentions are to learn what architects and builders have done to old barns in converting them into modern and contemporary homes. Or a modern day interpretation of old barn design using todays style and building practices. Thankfully for most of the barn renovations mentioned, the authors did a good job in marrying the fine attributes that the old buildings possess with the modern styles and comforts that is required to make them habitable. All the pictures are exquisite, sharp and in good detail. I found the book an excellent idea source for my own pending barn renovation."
1,Barns: Living in Converted and Reinvented Spaces,"Lovely pictures of completely souless houses. Almost without fail, the buildings depicted started as gorgeous rustic barns, were stripped of every bit of character (with the exception of some beam-work), and populated with cold modern furniture. There is no warmth, character, coziness, or sense of home in any of them. They are carefully sanitized, and devoid of any sense of history. I can assure you that if I get to do a barn conversion, it would look nothing like any of the barns in this book. This book is inspirational--it tells me what NOT to do."
5,LOL!!!,THIS GAME IS SO FUN AND COOL!!! U MUST BUY IF U TRYIN 2 HAVE THE ILLEST NES COLLECTION!!! I JUS GOT MINE!!! YEAAAH!!!
1,Warning! NOT the old formula - DO ALLERGY TEST.,"I wish I had googled to check out product first. I stupidly thought I would be okay since I never reacted to this product before but many people have been badly irritated by this newer formula according to reviews at one website. It can burn and irritated the skin badly. PLEASE do the skin test if you have not tried the new formula. I was led to try it since it came in a lighter shade, but as it turns out this was the darkest dye job I have ever had after leaving it on for the designated five minutes. LIGHT brown it is not, coal black maybe. And now I'm spending the day alternately washing and putting soothing lotion on skin."
1,3rd degree burns in a bottle,"I used Just for Men beard and moustache dye for the past three years with no problem. Last week I dyed my beard and moustache and the next morning I had scarlet skin, oozing blisters that don't heal without seeing a dermatologist (even after a week). I work in the pharmaceutical industry and can't believe the FDA has approved this. I am send Just for Men a bill for my doctor's visits and prescriptions. II contacted them and they said nothing had changed and to do a skin test. I told them I had been using the product weekly for the past 2 years and now my skins explodes for no reason???? They are liars and they need to remove the product from the market before they physically scar someone. Somewhere there has to be a class action suit against them. Find it and sign up. WARNING- even if you have been using this product with no problem like me. It can happen to you. AND IT WON'T HEAL WITHOUT A DOCTORS HELP."
1,When's the lawsuit coming?,"I used this product for years just like so many others. When the formula changed ""New and Improved"" I grabbed at it thinking it would last longer? Again, just like so many others, my skin burned, itched and I got sores. The itching would wake me up at night. I had to discontinue use and after about a week my skin felt normal again. No more! I want to know when this company is getting it's kick in the a** for realeasing something so harsh."
1,What the $%^^%!! happened!!??,"I used this product for year with great satisfaction. Then with the purchase of a new box I suffered the acid burns others are reporting. I wrote to the company and linked these posts. They denied that there is a ""new formula"" and simply said to do the skin tests and if necessary, discontinue use. I tried another brand and was very dissapointed with the result. Why does JFM not switch back to what worked (and didn't injured it's customers?) And if there really isn't a new formula, how do they explain that this had no adverse reactions before and suddenly - OH Mama! I'm on fire!!"
3,"Colors well, doesn't last long, can irritate your skin",Purchased a box of this a couple months ago and have used it several times. I keep my beard and moustache short so I don't have to use much and a single box can last for several applications.First time I used it I didn't have any irritation. After the third time using it I noticed an itching that appeared hours after applying it. The last time I used it the skin where it had been applied burned and itched.I have NEVER left it on longer than the 5 minutes described in the directions unless you count application time. I've even shortened the application time but still get the burn/itch.I don't want to stop using it but I don't see a choice unless there's some way to prepare your face for the product so it doesn't affect the skin.I think the product works as described and I'd continue using it if it didn't cause the skin irritation. The company should look into developing a way to dye the hair without affecting the skin.
1,Disfigured by Just for Men and FDA phone number,"Use this product JFM Brush in Gel M-25 and you'll get a Chemical Burn the might just Scar you for Life...I did.Multiple trips to ERTerrible, oozing Puss blisters3rd Degree Burns.Permanent Scars and Depigmentation spots.Report damage caused by this product to FDA @ 800-353-3965"
1,DANGER! CAUTION! PLEASE READ! DO NOT USE!,"I have been using JFM for quite a few years with only a few itchy times here and there. But, MY GOD WTF is in the product now? I've done the patch test with no adverse results, but my face is ON FIRE. I do believe that there have been chemical burns to my skin as it's bright red, burns like hell. I have been scratching so intensely that I have literally cut my cheeks with my nails. It's 3:20 a.m. and I cannot get to sleep as my face is freaking burning. I had applied the gel yesterday morning about 10:00 and it's been burning since then. I've considered going to the ER-Yes it's that bad. I was looking in the mirror at the skin and noticed what appeared to be my skin peeling away when I scratched. DO NOT USE! I think there needs to be some sort of law suit to this company."
2,Color doesn't stay in....,It is supposed to be for coarse hard-to-dye hair and stay in until the grey grows out....NOT! Washes out.
1,"DON'T USE IT - WILL GIVE YOU A ICHY, OOZING RASH THAT WON'T GO AWAY","DON'T USE IT - THEIR RECENT FORMULA GIVES YOU A RASH AT THE HAIR LINE, ITCES LIKE CRAZY. MY DERMATOLOGIST CALLED IT DERMATITUS AND GAVE ME TWO CREAMS, A WEEK LATER STILL HAVE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A RUG BURN ON MY CHIN. IT OOZES CLEAR FLUID, ICHES, IS STRAWBERRY RED. WON'T GO AWAY. I'M GOING TO RESEARCH IF THERE IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT GOING ON AND JOIN IN. THEN GOING BACK TO MY DERMATOLOGIST. IF THIS LEAVES A SPOT THAT WON'T TAN, I'M GOING TO SUIT THE HELL OUT OF THE MANUFACTURER."
4,tried this stuff 1st time today,"i just tried it a yesterday-just for men in 'Ash Brown'--so i brought it home and put some on my inner elbow for a skin test for 2 hours-(your supposed to skin test for 48 hours) and felt nothing--so i went ahead and used it--my beard is kinda thin and gray, so i wanted to put some on the sideburn area--it matched my hair color perfect i think--i like it so far--------update 2/9/2012...did my 2nd application-(about 2 weeks after the 1st)-saw that i missed a spot when i was done-reapplied at the spot i missed-obviously,your not supposed to do that-got a minor irritation on a bare skin area at the spot i missed-from now on, i put masking tape on the bare skin areas near the beard-so just use it carefully-avoid getting it on skin--leave it on maybe 4-1/2 minutes, then rinse it and shampoo it right away"
1,Dangerous product now.,"Adding another voice to those who feel this product has changed.I had used it without issue for several years, then this last summer experienced all the problems so many have noted here. Burning, itching, weeping sores. These lasted for weeks, then have only gradually improved. Clearly chemical burning, with remaining scars and skin discoloration.Tried switching to a different batch number, same results. Will NEVER use this again, but already too late, some damage appears permenent."
1,As a lot of others have said.......,"Be careful with this stuff. I use dozens of times and had know problems. I used it for the last time a week ago. Two days after using it my chin is itching badly. In the shower, getting it wet makes it worse. Then 5 days after using it my lower lip is swollen the last couple of days. I am hoping it doesn't get worse and have to go to a doctor."
3,"Yes, I agree, these negative reviews are a hoax...(Update - maybe not.)","I'm quite sure that some people have had allergic reactions to this product, hence the patch test instructions in the package. But I used the product after doing the patch test and no bad reactions at all. None. I have experienced allergic reactions over the years to various things so I understand the concept. But this product seems rather benign.09-02-12: After using this product for about a year I am now getting redness and mild swelling."
1,Acid,"Just confirming what others have said, I'd compare this product to throwing acid all over your face. In fact, check out the time of this review (UK time) the reason, I can't sleep! Used this product two days ago and my face is still feeling like it's on fire. Please, if you value your face and don't like pain, then keep well clear of this product. Something must have changed with the ingredients over the years, and previous use was fine.It really is quite shocking that such a product can be sold openly in the market place without extreme warnings over it's packaging.As others have indicated, something needs to be done about this product and quickly...................."
1,You will burn your face!,"I have used this product for seven years; after the formula was changed, it gave me severe burns on my face. Stay away from this product."
3,Not Bad,"This new formula came out some time in 2007 or 2006. I have not had any skin reaction to it but I did several times with the formula before this. This typically lasts 3-5 days when my beard is short, I trim it down every 6-8 weeks so the thicker my beard is the less often I have to dye it. Haven't found anything else for beards so I keep using it. I also use this to dye my hair because it seems to last longer then the Just For Men hair dye. It does dye much darker than you would think so you might want to try one or 2 shades lighter. UPDATE: Occasionally my face would get slightly red and sometimes itch with irritation but I have found that as soon as I rinse it out in the shower, I shampoo my beard and I don't have the problem any more."
1,Severe Chemical Burn Warning!,"I have used JFM for over five years without any problems at all. Last week I applied it and within minutes my face began to burn. When I awoke in the morning my skin was not only burned red, but blisters oozing puss appeared on the area where it was applied. It was so severe it required medical attention. After the blisters finally disappeared, I then noticed that it also removed the pigmentation from my skin! What a nightmare! I found a web site where over 80 other men described the exact same reaction to their 'New Formula'.http://www.folica.com/Just_For_Men_Sh_r1235_1.htmlWhen I called the JFM help line, they shrugged it off and suggested I get tested for allergies prior to every application! This product should be removed from the market!"
1,Should Be Pulled Off the Shelves! Stay Away!,"I have used JFM products in the past with no problem, including the beard/mustache gel, also with no problem. I grow a beard from time to time, although it's been years since the last time. Well I don't know what they did to the formula but I will never use this crap again. It left me with painful, itchy, chemical burns all over my face which took days to eventually heal. I had to slather myself with first aid cream and avoid shaving because the sores would open up and bleed, gross I know. I've heard that the formula was changed and that thsi problem has been experienced by millions of users. So naturally it begs the question why is this garbage still on the market?? DO NOT USE!"
1,Can I give this no stars,"This is truly a terrible product. Once you develop a sensitivity to it, you're toast, so to speak. As the instructions say, be sure to go through the skin test procedure each time you buy a new batch."
1,Dangerous Product,"Do not use Just for Men. It has obviously been changed as my husband found out after using this on his beard. He has been using the beard formula for years, probably once every couple of months. After the last usage he found that within a couple of hours of using it his skin started to itch terribly, came up in sores and all his face was burning, even though he used it sparingly on his goatee. This has taken about a week to stop itching, although now his skin is peeling like a bad case of sunburn. There are many reports of this problem on the internet, the general opinion being that this is a chemical burn not an allergic reaction. Seriously dangerous."
1,JUST FOR MEN MOUSTACHE AND BEARD DYE,I suffered severe burns under my nose and around my mouth when I used the recent product. I had been using Just for Men Moustache and Beard Dye for around 10 years. I had no idea that they had changed the chemical make-up of the product. One portion of my lip was so badly burned that the hair will not grow back. Everyone thought that I had either burned myself or had a terrible cold and had sores all over my lip. A Class Action Suit would be prime for this product.
3,Can burn skin - But this tip helped me,"Yes, I agree. It can burn the skin, and for a long time I didn't know why sometimes it did and other times it didn't. Here's the best tip I can give. Don't use it AFTER shaving near an area. Use it first and THEN shave around the area. I haven't had burns since. My guess is it has something to do with abrasions to the skin. You can't use it on any area that has any kind of abrasions or scratches. I also try not to use it more than 3 times a week. Hope that helps."
1,Chemical burns here too,"My stepdad has been using this for years, and just got a chemical burn from it. His face is weeping and crusty, and the weeping that drips down his chest just spreads the burns further. This is obviously a problem that needs to stop. How many more people need to suffer before the company is shut down?!"
1,Just For Men No More,"I've been a JFM user for at least 18 years. I was using it before my hair turned grey and never had a problem. I shaved for a while and when i started to grow my beard again I went back to my old stand by, now New and Improved and it literally burned the skin off, my face swelled, puss seeped, itching set in and i was miserable for three weeks. I initially thought my skin had just gotten sensitive but after deciding to do some research I've discovered many people suffered the same fate from the New And Improved JFM...... NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Chemical Burns for me too!!!!,"I have been seeing a dermatologist who is charging me for $$$ for removing these puss filled scabs that developed on my chin under my goatee. Lo and Behold it's Just for Men to blame! How do they sell this absolutely harmful, pathetic garbage? I stopped using it a month ago and my scabs are healing and going away. Send some to someone you hate for their birthday. What a sick and pathetic FDA we have in this country."
1,Just For Men beard and mustache,"Be VERY careful. One use and I have severe burn and itching that has lasted days!! I rinsed in shower before the directed 5 minutes and am now sorry I tried this product. I agree, a class action suit may be necessary here. Pre-use skin test is not sufficient and this stuff is absolutely dangerous!!!! Plus, the ""light brown"" turned my beard black, which is not my hair color."
1,do Not buy,"Applied this to my beard last night. Today it was itching and burning so badly I couldn't stand it and also noticed some redness on my face near where i had applied it. It finally got to the point where I had to shave my beard off...so not happy. Now my face is all red, swollen and still burning and itching from this crap. I'm afraid to go out in public now looking like this. Someone needs to get a class action lawsuit together and get this product off the market!"
1,Imagine your worst nightmare,"I used this product for 8 years with no problems. Two months ago I had a severe reaction, and the symptoms are still there. My face itches intensely, there are bumps and scabs all around my mouth and my lips are cracked and bleeding. The only thing I can do to soothe the pain is to apply a hypoallergenic face cream many times per day. Any cream with alcohol, perfumes, etc, burns horribly and further irritates my face. The reaction to JFM led to itchiness other parts of my body too, particulary my right arm which, two months later, is still scabbing and oozing with dozens of sores, some 1/2 inch in diameter, which have left scars. We need a natural product, something with henna, the chemicals used in this JFM product are extremely dangerous. No one can tell me why my symptoms will not go away. The itchiness and pain is still so bad that I usually have trouble sleeping at night."
1,CALL THE LAWYERS! CLASS ACTION IMMINENT!,"Every retailer should pull this product! I have had the exact experience described by so many others. Used the product without any adverse reaction for half a year. Suddenly developed a horrible reaction. The reaction goes away VERY SLOWLY after stopping use of the product. I've never been alergic to anything. Hard not to be alergic to an ACID BURN I guess. Thank God for these reviews and a few other websites, which identified the problem for me. I had never had a problem with JFM in the past, so I didn't suspect it was causing the sores at first. I THOUGHT I HAD SKIN CANCER!! It was that bad. I am hoping that there is no permanent scarring. It's been 2 months now and I still have varying scaring and some itching, though it is still subsiding. Don't even think about putting this crap on your face...and if you already have, call your doctor, the FDA and your lawyer!"
4,"some experimenting will yield better results, it did for me",I think the guy who sid he did his on Saturday morning is right. the coloor mutes some in a day as you shower ect. Letting it look natural. If I leave the color in as long as the directions say it comes out too dark some hair almost black Sandy blonde does not lool right that way! About 3 minutes and i use a clock you can not wish this stuff right. It is chemistry. I also add more white paste and mix well. I just use my palm but you should do it the safe way on the box is my thought. wash it out fast as time clicks. I also dont try to cover a bit of grey on the edge as people have seen the grey and are used to it> i get little notice if i adhere to my methods Oh yeah stand the tube on it's ends and change them every few days to keep color mixed.I might be wrong about some of this but it seems to work and i STAY ON Schedule!!! Good luck
3,"Good, not great.",Used this product for a few years as it's the only retail product of it's type I've found. Color lasts 5-9 days before you have to reuse. Important to use a stopwatch to time correctly and experiment with the timing until you know exactly when to rinse out.
4,"Good, but not perfect for my router","This pre-drilled aluminum plate is very good with one exception. I have a Porter Cable 890 series router. One of the reasons I chose that router is that it features above the table depth adjustment. This plate is pre drilled to hold the router but, is not drilled for the depth adjustment. It was no real effort to drill the holes on my own, but... I'm going to rate it a four rather than a five since I had to modify it on my own."
5,bench dog 40-018 group 1,I purchased the Bench Dog Router Plate for use sith a Porter-Cable 7539works great with a router razer 100.
5,Up to par with the rest of their albums,I have about 10 of S.H.E.'s albums and I love this one. It is as good as any of their other albums.
3,Great looking toy - speaker for microphone doesn't work correctly,The Knapford Station is really cute and my son loves it. But the speaker for the microphone doesn't work correctly. We tried new batteries but that didn't help. We have to put our ear against the speaker and can then faintly hear the sounds from the microphone and the pre-recorded announcements.
4,"Good saw, good price.","Bought it because it was [reasonable], was a PC (I like their stuff) and because I needed it to do some work in my home addition. Have used it a bit now and I'm very pleased with it. It vibrates a bit but I only notice it if I don't have the saw pressed firmly against material being cut. It cuts well. Zip and you're through whatever. The case is fine but the cord is a tight fit and the blade storage area won't hold a long blade. Big deal. The saw works just fine as didn't cost me an arm and a leg. I'd do it again."
1,Not a dollar,"I have had this game for a long time.From what I remember it was aweful.If your one of those ""save points are for sissies"" kinda guys you'll like it.Essentially you will play a level, beat everyone down, kinda figure out the sequence the guys come at youmaking them easier to take down. Problem is until you do this, everytime you run outta lives, your back at level 1.Expect to see LOTS of level 1 for a while =PAs for gameplay, its terrible, just terrible, even then I wasn't impressed, try for yourself if your not a believer.I wouldn't pay $1 for this. Think of it as a very very very downgraded version of the original Final Fight, inferior in every way."
5,Great Price Geat Product,"Like the fact that the connector fit my factory connector on my 2002 Suzuki XL7. Other O2 sensors require you to assemble the connector, not this one. Now the error code for my O2 senor is gone."
3,Works good but would not use in food,"I bought this hoping to use in mixing food. But I would never do that. FOOD gets STUCK under the grey plastic disc under the blade. It is soooo gross. I knew something was awry when, I washed it after my first use, something was drooling out from under that disc. I took a knife and popped it out to find a lot of food trapped under there. So if you do have one of these I suggest popping that out and cleaning it out real good-EACH time. Eventually grease startes to come out in small amounts. VERY poor design. I don't want that in my food or remnants of rotted food from a previous use. So I use it in soap, and have to pop the disc out each time to clean under there. It works great! Just not good for food."
2,Worked great...for 18 months,"This was a great hand blender, blending large pots of pureed soup, smoothies with ice, etc. However the coupling stripped from the pin inside the motorized component and it wouldn't spin any of the attachments. It has a one year warranty and sure enough, after 18 mos. it broke. After going back and forth with KitchenAid ""customer service"" the ""best"" they could offer me was to sell me a new motorized component at a discount of 30% which I can still buy $20 cheaper on Amazon. They didn't stand behind the quality of their product and I am thoroughly disappointed. BTW, not surprisingly it was made in China."
5,No mixed feelings.,"I've owned several mixing wands in the past, all of which eventually burned out. This item is extremely well made. It separates in to two parts making it easy to store. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a mixing wand."
1,"great until it died, too soon","I would have agreed with all the rave reviews yesterday, but last night mine stopped working. Only the whisk will turn a tiny bit, the blender and chopper don't spin at all. The product was used moderately, perhaps 3 times a month, and is just over two years old. I agree it was a great appliance up until this point-- good design, and seemed very sturdy. This makes it all the more disappointing that it no longer works. I really hate the built-in obsolescence that seems common in modern products. Two years is way too short for an appliance to last. Based on other negative reviews, it seems KitchenAid has a real quality control problem--they should address this or offer a longer warranty. I'm also guessing that many of the positive reviews were written after owning it less than a year."
2,Handy but has its issues,"We have owned our Kitchen Aid hand blender for probably 2 years with light to moderate use. It's very handy to have but has some issues, including longevity.Ours just died. It stopped working completely. Before that we had issues with the chopper attachment. It was impossible to open the lid on it unless you pried it open with a knife. The main blender attachment also got stuck somehow so it wouldn't turn. I don't know if it got liquid in it that then jammed it or what. Like some of the other negative reviews our little end cap came loose.For the money spent on this device I think there are better options. I'm looking to replace but not with a Kitchenaid. we love the large commercial mixer but the hand blender, not so much. If anyone has recommendations, I would love to hear them."
1,"Not well designed, does not last","I have had it for two years and the whisk attachment has fallen off, I have only used it a couple of times. My old braun performed a lot better. There are lots of places for food to get stuck inside the blender. The blender feels large and cumbersome when using it."
2,"Great idea, quality issues","Loved it in red. It looked nice and sturdy but soon after I started using it, the mixer attachment detached from the plastic base and I could never use it again. I use the chopper attachment regularly but each time it takes a lot of effort to open it and sometimes the contents get all over the place because of the force I exert to open it. I have no issues with the immersion blender attachment.My favorite part is that it is an all-in-one unit. Although it takes much less space than having a separate mixer, blender and chopper, the unit itself is not small. I used to have a similar unit by Braun that was much smaller (it was an older design for $35. I'm not sure they make it now). I loved Braun so much better but it stopped working. It was also much cheaper. If I were to chose between the two I would probably go with Braun."
5,Wife loves it!,"My wife loves this, it's a handy little mixer. Need to whip some eggs to scramble? No problem, takes about 15 seconds with this bad boy."
4,Great product but...,"This is not so much a review on the product- that my mother loves just fine. Says it works like a dream and loves all the attachments. Said she's been using it almost every day since she received it. I tried to leave a ""packaging review"" but no orders showed up there. My gripe is that it was purchased as a gift and I asked Amazon to put the gift note in with the blender. However, when my mother received the blender she had to call around to all of us to see if we had sent her a hand blender for her birthday because she was about to send it back. Not what my aging mother should have to be doing on her birthday. Amazon- please...When the buyer asks that a gift note be put in the box make sure that the ""gift note"" gets put in the box! If you are having 3rd parties ship out the products and can't verify that packaging instructions are being followed, don't offer that option with 3rd party shippers."
5,Very handy and seems a good value,"I was tempted to buy the Bamix since everyone agrees it is the top of the line for durability. But I wasn't really sure how much I would use one of these. The KA is less than $100, less than a third the price of the Bamix. I really couldn't justify getting the Bamix given that difference. So far I'm pleased with the KA -- feels solid and works smoothly. It's fun to use! I pureed some tomato sauce today (trying to utilize all the tomatoes coming out of the garden). I was very happy with how easy it was to use and how well it performed. Still not sure how often I will use it but since you can buy three of these for the price of the Bamix, I think it was a good choice."
5,Great Product!,"I bought this blender/chopper for my daughter and she loves it! So far she's used it mainly for preparing baby food. She said it works great, is easy to use, and would definitely recommend."
1,Quit on me,I loved my stick blender until it quit on me 15 months after I received it. I called kitchen aid and they would not replace it for me.
2,I give up! My fourth one is my last one!,"I believe totally in Kitchenaid appliances. Every appliance in my kitchen is Kitchenaid. I own TWO Kitchenaid mixers. But, I just threw away my last Kitchenaid immersion blender after the fourth one stripped its gears. We make smoothies mostly, and this blender just won't hold up to the stresses of blending the ice. I give it two stars because it is easy to clean, and if you use it lightly, you'll probably love it."
4,Best of it's kind,"I haven't used the whisk yet, it looks a little flimsy, but I love the other components. Definitely worth the money. It feels nice to handle and easy to use. Feels like it will last a while, good product."
4,KitchenAid Hand Blender,"Great product. It's fast, easy, and powerful, just don't overflow the the plastic beaker because the contents will explode all over you."
3,Spatters somethin' fierce!!!,"This is a great product, but the design engineers certainly failed in their testing of the hand blender. It spatters up and out of the bowl or kettle, like leaving the cover off a regular blender. I am terribly disappointed that KitchenAid would let this go to market because it is an appliance I use almost every day. The little chopper bowl that comes with it is really great though for small chopping and blending jobs. I did sort of solve the problem of avoiding total destruction of the kitchen by cutting a small hole in a paper plate after slashing it to the center and slipping it around the post. It fits over my bowl and the mess is all on the bottom of the paper plate. Good luck if you buy one."
5,The Best You can Buy,"With all the attachments you don't need a big countertop food processor for those little chopping jobs. This is effortless chopping, egg white beating, cream whipping, salsa making bliss. I don't know how I ever lived without this in my kitchen."
5,Excellent kitchen tool!,I love this little gadget. It is wonderful for making sauces and soups and for just about anything you need a blender for. You'll like it. I received mine for Christmas 2009.
5,love it,I am 83 years old and find this to be very easy to use because of its small and light product. I use it for everything from chopping to blending. I also like the different speeds so I could regulate what I am chopping. It is easy to clean also. Amazon's service was excellent.
1,Blender,Sadly the blender was for an American plug not Australian. My husband bought a plug adaptor however the blender blew up first use.
5,"Great,much better than the less powerful Cuisinart","I tried two times the Cuisinart hand blender, and both times the small processor quit spinning. But the Kitchen aid just takes a beating and keeps on blending. I love it. Use it all the time."
5,So far so good,"Rating and review is based on using it only a few times so far. I keep forgetting I have it! I wanted a good immersion blender for a long time and finally decided to shell out for a really good one. And this is a very good one. It's actually kind of amazing how FAST it works. I've not yet used the chopper but will in the upcoming week since I've planned several meals requiring chopping fresh herbs. I imagine I will use it much more when the weather gets cold and I move into soup season but I also can jams and jellies and I know I'll use it for this as well. It's very easy to clean, I love the storage bag, it is powerful and fast, and I am very happy I bought it. On the menu for the upcoming week which will put this belnder to work (I have an old friend coming to town and I want to cook and forget Weight Watchers for a week): Butternut Squash Ravioli, Gazpacho (from tomatoes, not V-8), and I will also do homemade mayo. That's the first 3 days of the week! I can't wait!"
5,great product,I have bought a few hand blenders in the past. This one was a little more money but definitely worth it. It has speed adjustments that work well for various things. I also love the whisk it come with and the handy storage bag.
5,Love this kitchen tool,"I have a small kitchen, without a lot of storage space, and I love this product. It basically functions as a food processor for me. I also love the immersion blender attachment. I frequently make soup, and this speedy, reliable, and easy to clean attachment makes lovely creamed soups. This is literally my favorite kitchen tool."
5,Wonderful product,I would definatley recommend to product for purchase. I have just started using it but so far ease of operation is very good & it performs very well!
3,easy,The Kitchen Aid hand mixer is convenient and easy to use. I wish it had a little more power. With hard ice cream and other harder things it works pretty hard. Otherwise we really love it.
2,Makes a HUGE mess!,"I had a Braun Multiquick that I *loved*, and left behind with an ex-boyfriend. Since the Braun is no longer available, I bought this one, since it had good reviews and was in a similar price range so I expected to love it similarly.The immersion stick makes the BIGGEST MESS! Seriously! It's got those holes in the part around the blade and food squirts out them and goes everywhere every time I lift the holes above the surface level of the food, which is constantly so I can get the food at the top under the blade. I made baby food with it today and everything within a 3-foot radius is now splattered with green beans, and I hope my shirt comes clean!I really, really miss my Braun... :("
1,Worst product i've bought,"After ONE single use, the blender unit dindt work any more,.. it just doesnt spins! Tech support in my country said is normal, because this products are single use only... WHat???Very poor construction material in the screw which connects to the motor base and spins. Never more..."
5,One of the most psychologically sophisticated novels I've ever read,"I am a psychotherapist interested in crime novels. This mystery novel found me holding my breath at the psychological suspense at times The writer creates psychologically complex characters and gradually links them to one another. She also paints a sense of place in nature and in a small village that one can feel with your senses. I had never heard of this author but looked up Agatha award winners and read one of her books, leading to this book. This book was far superior to the award winner she wrote!!!"
1,Stopped working after 8 mos of infrequent use,"When it worked, it was great. But after 8 mos and using it maybe 10 total times, the motor just stopped working. Very disappointing given the price. Based on other reviews, sounds like it may just be a matter of time for anyone that owns this product."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this item yesterday, Kitchen Aid Model KHB100ER (red), at a local Fred Meyer store here in Seattle. It worked great for just about two seconds, while I was mixing soup, before it totally died. One would think that such appliances should be checked out at the factory, prior to shipment. I'm just glad that I didn't purchase this as a gift, because I would have been very embarrassed. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because the replacement provided at the store seems to work okay, but who knows how long it will last."
4,A very efficient tool,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband but in fact, I wanted it for myself! it works beautifully in puree-ing soup both while in the pot or a bowl. The weight is fine too. I have only good things to say about this product."
5,This blender is amazing!,What took me so long to buy an immersion blender? The KitchenAid Hand Blender is easy to use and easy to clean up. The blender stores easily and doesn't take up much space. I'm making more cream soups than ever before!
2,Grainy Smoothies and weak motor,"We had this mixer for about 24months. Not only was the product not able to really blend soups and smoothies - they were always still grainy, something I didn't expect knowing other handheld blenders - but also did it break twice. The first time within 2 weeks into the warranty. The engine did burn out. We did not use it at the high power setting, we were taking breaks and it started to smoke and broke. The warranty allowed a quick exchange for a new product - 23.5months later the second unit broke with the same symptoms.We won't be looking into buying this product again."
3,"Not Industrial, but not exactly lightweight blender","This hand blender cannot, I repeat, cannot handle heavy-duty jobs that has peanut butter consistency. I have burnt out the motor twice instantly. I did pulses 1-3 seconds over several seconds, and it still burns out. The KitchenAid Warranty Services has been great, and replaced the blender twice. I stayed away from these ""peanut butter consistency"" stuff after 3rd time, and used it to mix my powder-mix drinks. It's overkill for blending drinks, and useless for making real sauces, various butter, etc. I think KitchenAid engineers designed this blender with high velocity, low power to create illusion that it's ""powerful"" blender...it goes fast and goes quickly. Not recommended..."
2,Breaks in about six months of daily use,This is the third one we have bought. We use it to make smoothies about four times a day. It always breaks within six months--always something a little different. We are trying an Cuisinart next time.
1,Junk - Fell apart and mfg refused to help,This unit lasted several months then the bottom blender rod stripped out. Cheap plastic part not meant to last. Kimberly in customer service offered to sell me a new part for 30 bucks and said there was nothing else they would do. Nice.Cuisinart makes a much higher quality unit which we are quite happy with.It's too bad a good name like Kitchen Aid won't stand behind their products.[...]
5,Great Tool at a Great Price,"I was always skeptical about hand blenders after seeing my mom struggle with weak ones growing up. I bought this in college before I bought my food processor, and I was surprised at how great and versatile it was. First off I love the red color (it stands out without being obnoxious). I've used it for tons of things including soups (saves so much time), milk shakes and even things like salsa and hummus.The motor on this thing is pretty powerful and I rarely go to settings above 3-4. The included mixing cup is pretty handy, but it scratches fairly easy and with its height so much greater than its width sometimes things can get compacted if dry ingredients (but I didn't buy it for the mixing cup). I've had it for a while now, and I don't have any reservations recommending it!"
3,TOP HEAVY,"WELL MADE, BUT TOP HEAVY AND UNSTABLE. STRONG MOTOR BUT DOES NOT SUCK UP PANCAKE OR WAFFLE MIX FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL. THIS WAS THE PURPOSE THAT I PURCHASED HAND BLENDER. EASY TO CLEAN."
3,Mystifying device,My wife asked for this thing as a Christmas gift and she does not use it. This is what I expected because it appears to be nothing more than a trendy kitchen gadget that is more trouble to clean than it is worth to use it. I consider it to have been a waste of money.
4,Space-effective and easy to clean,"I've only used it to make smoothies. Holding it for a couple of minutes is not a issue for me (I don't feel it heavy at all), but I can imagine it to be inconvenient for the elderlys. It saves space, and is pretty easy to clean, compared to a non-hand-held blender I used before."
4,Silent and powerful,Recently bought this product and have used it only on a few occasions. Have noticed two things. One It is relatively silent. Earlier I had a cheap low powered stick and that was a lot noisier. secondly it is extremely powerful. Does my blending job quickly. I have used it with hot ingredients and so far no problems.Would have rated it 5 star if I had used it for longer.
1,Good For a little while,I received this Brand new as a gift and loved it. Till the motor stopped working after about a dozen LIGHT uses. When I called the company they said it wasn't under warranty and had a probable sell date of 2010 and since been discontinued BUT they could sell me one for 39.95. When I asked why this had been discontinued they said the new models had Bigger DC motors.Makes me think they Knew the motors are a problem.Needless to say I wont be getting a Kitchenaide again
1,doesn't work,Re: Kitchen Aid Immersion Blender. I bought it as gift and held on to it until Christmas and it doesn't work. I bought all the attachments and the cloth bag to store it in. It seems I have had it too long for it to be returned so I am out almost $100.
4,Great product...got this as a gift and now giving it as a gift!,"I received this as a wedding gift and my 91-year old grandmother loved using when visiting for Thanksgiving...so I bought her one for Christmas.She initially had trouble getting the attachment off. I assured her that she cannot break it. With a little more force, she was able to get it on and off just fine."
2,great but don't make smoothies,Like a bunch of people here I get to throw mine out cuz my wife makes smoothies. The plastic drive dog (which should be metal as it takes the full load) stripped. There is no replacement parts and the thing looks like it can't even come apart (probably glued). Before I spend another 100 bucks I'll read reviews on other brands and find one that is sturdier and hopefully repairable. Don't say I didn't warn you.
2,Misleading Images Don't Show The Power Cord!,"None of the product images show the big heavy power cord that you must use with this unit.Images imply it's cordless, but it's not!"
2,Disappointed that it only lasted for 3 years,We use this blender all the time and now the mixer makes a high pitch noise. It stated in the owner's manual that the mixer attachment could be put in the dishwasher but I would not do that.
2,"Good motor, Poor use of plastic","I bought this in 2008 and use it 1-3 times a week. The motor is still strong, but the drive shaft and gear box are made of plastic. The plastic is now stripped and can no longer turn the blade. I don't think it's ethical to manufacturer a critical moving part out of plastic that will inevitably wear out before the motor does. Last night I glued the parts together to hopefully keep this tool out of a landfill a little longer."
2,Kitchen Aid KHB100ER1 Buyer Beware,"I've had the Kitchen Aid Blender for about 2 years. It did very well the first year. Then it stared to get hard to get the blade to Engage the motor, soon after that the blade would not spin. The part that turns the blade is PLASTIC and is stripped out. I blend Soup, powdered protein drinks,protein malts with ice cream soft stuff that is small. It only had a pulse button so what ever I blended was fast. Cooks Illustrated recommends this I give it 2 stars it basically cost 55.00 a year to operate and Kitchen Aid is NO help, out of warranty. Buyer Beware."
1,mine broke sith very little use,"i used mine, maybe 10-times, then it broke. the inner workings (the drive shaft and the gear box--the thing that make the blade turn) are all made out of plastic. the plastic breaks very easily and your blender is worthless.i had to throw mine out after about 10 uses.Ironically i thought the KitchenAid mixer would be an upgrade to the 10model i picked up at the cheap store.... i wish i had hung on to that cheap ten dollar version, as it had well over 100 uses with no problems.i chose the expensive brand name and the sleek look of the KitchenAid Mixer, you however, should not.j"
4,Great Xmas Gift,"Purchase this blender(KitchenAid KHB100ER Hand Blender, Empire Red ) for my son to use in his small kitchen and he loves it. It does every thing he needs it to and takes up no space on the counter."
5,Love it!!!!,"So glad I bought this, wish I had gotten one sooner!!!!! I make alot of homemade soup and I use this immersion blender to thicken up the soup. it is so much easier to just stick this in the pot, rather than my old way, which was to ladle soup in to the blender and puree it, then place it into a bowl, do another blender or 2 full of soup, then put it all back into the pot. Ugh. What a pain, and the blender was a pain to clean too. This immersion blender saves me so much time and work. To clean it I just stuck it into my soapy water in the sink and turned it on, clean in about 30 seconds. Love, love, love it."
4,Storytelling at its best,"I first encountered ""The Tale of The Swamp Rat"" as a galley at an industry tradeshow, before the book itself was actually released. I read through the first couple of pages, and was hooked immediately by Carter Crocker's natural narrative style. Since then, I've read the entire book and relished every sentence. I often use this book as a teaching aid, to help my creative writing students understand just what ""style"" can mean to a story. Of course, it's the style and great characterizations of the swamp creatures that make this book so good. Some of my creative writing kids have complained that the story is a little slow; this is definitely a book for readers who love words and understand how magical they can be when woven together in just the right way."
3,an okay book,"I read Tale of the Swamp Rat. I liked the book because I like fiction books. I also liked the story because they went on a big adventure and reached where they wanted to go. I like it when animals talk.I didn't like the book because Ossie's (the swamp rat) brothers, sisters, and Mom and Dad died so quickly. They died because of a rattle snake.I think you should buy this book because it's exciting and you don't know what is going to happen next. Will R. age 9"
3,House and drum n bass with light ethnic accents.,"If it's House and drum n bass you seek with light ethnic accents and overtones underneath, Keita's REMIXES FROM MOFFOU is the item of choice: his basic traditional sound has here been transformed for the modern dance audience who needs the bass heavy and the African light."
3,Works for a few tools.,I use a Festool vac and need various connector adapters. This one is for some of my tools. Works fine - doesn't leak.
1,Two in a row broke,"I bought two of these. Both have cracked lengthwise on the 1 1/2 in side of the adapter after about 20-30 uses. Plan on reinforcing the adapter with a tie wrap or a hose clamp, it does not appear to be well made."
4,"Not as useful as #20's, but still a great deal!","For years I have been using P-C biscuits in my woodworking projects. Since I work with alot of 3/4"" - 5/4"" wood, I use #20 biscuits more than the smaller #10 and #00, but I have found that these #10 biscuits excell at reinforcing mitered corners.I have not had any significant amount of ""bad"" biscuits from Porter-Cable. There is an occasional thick one - meaning it either didn't get compressed as it should have or it swelled from moisture - but these are few and far between.Basically, I have had nothing but good luck with these so I highly recommend them!"
3,"Much harder than the ""original"" Tempur-Pedic","The claim ""Don't be fooled into buying an ""original"" Tempur-Pedic for no reason. Our pillow is guaranteed to feel and perform the same or your money back!!!"" is not true in my opinion. I used the Origional Tempur-Pedic at the store where I purchased my bed and it was much softer and form fitting. The Refund Policy is for 80% refund so be sure this is what you want before you purchase. I was burt with a restock fee not shown in items discription."
2,Doesn't feel like memory foam,I have a Tempurpedic cushion which I love and often use as a pillow. This pillow doesn't feel half as comforting as that.It did arrive fast and my questions about the product were promptly addressed. Seems like a durable pillow.
3,Liked my old pillow better.,"I ordered two of this with the mattress. I'm very happy with the mattress, but not with the pillows. My wife end up not using this and so do I. It is too hard and kept my neck in an uncomfortable position giving me a neck pain. It really didn't Foam in as I expected. May be my head is too light :)"
4,An Ancient Critique of an Ancient Text,"This edition of the Emerald Tablet which in which Hortulanus gives commentary of the thirteen ""stanzas"" of the Hermes most famous work. The translation by Patrick J. Smith is readable with explanatory notes. There is a short introduction which attempts to give a concise history of the Emerald Tablet, then proceeds from there to read the Tablet in full, while thereafter is the commentary then notes. Not a long book, however the dialect of the times is enough to slow the reader down a bit, not to mention the dense subject matter. Its not an entirely entertaining book, but fascinating in itself is the Emerald Tablet. The notes are without references, however well written in a dry, scholarly form. Reccomended for the student of alchemy and occultism."
5,High Quality Chess Set,We bought this for my son for Christmas and could not be happier with the purchase. I remember playing chess with my grandfather growing up. Chess taught me so much! I have enjoyed passing those lessons on to my kids through the game.This set is very well crafted and put together. My son was very excited when he opened it up Christmas morning and we have already had fun playing each other! Definitely would recommend!
5,Spectacular Deal,"This chessboard is neither light nor small. It doesn't feel disposable and it doesn't look like a toy. I was looking for a nice chess set for a 9-year-old. I wanted it to be high enough quality to last for years as a personal possession, but not so high-priced as to be unreasonable as a child's gift. I was hesitant to order this product because the price seemed a bit low, but I was pleased to discover that it was exactly what I hoped for. I wouldn't mind keeping this one in my office. It arrived swiftly and unbroken. I highly recommend this."
4,"A beautiful, if fragile, chess set.","This arrived with a few cracks up the side of the board/case, but the detail of the board and pieces is beautiful - you simply won't find anything close to it for the money. All things considered, it is a great value! My 9-year-old son is just starting to play chess with his friends and since it is more fun to play with actual knights on the board than it is with the standard nondescript pieces, he is playing more often and getting pretty good!"
2,Chess Set,I was very impressed with the service from the company as it was damaged when I got it and they sent me another one right away. When it came damaged also I just wasn't real impressed with the product. It is made out of a material that breaks very easily. I would not recommend it.
1,Terrible,"Puras mexicanadas. Solo siven ""Madrecita del alma"" y ""Las mananitas"", aunque con tono mexicano, pero por ser grandes canciones se pueden escuchar."
5,Rock's Roller Coaster Ride,"Ready for the roller coaster ride of rock and roll? Lonn Friend's ""Planet Rock' takes the reader from the beginning of 'life' when he witnessed the Beatles on 'The Ed Sullivan' show through The Who, Kiss, G'NR, Nirvana and Pearl Jam along with Winger, Slaughter and Bon Jovi. Lonn's reverence for all types of music and his respect for the artists who create it, is clear on every page, every word written. What a joy to read the inside scoop of so many events in the rock world from a truthful, insightful, compassionate and, thankfully, non exploitive point of view. For an engrossing read that brings back memories of where YOU were when all this music impacted and made the sound track to your life, pick up a copy of 'Planet Rock' now through Amazon and give a shout out to Lonn on his grass roots tour of the country during his book promotion!"
2,Boring..,"Pretty much sums it up. If you have read any of the books on 80's hair metal (The Dirt, Slash, Hell Bent for Leather) you are going to be EXTREMELY disappointed. The stories are long and pointless. By mid-book, you know the author pretty well; he's the guy who name drops every important person known to man, yet the stories of association are bland and uninteresting. They go on and on and there are several chapters that leave you screaming for the end and not in a good way. You also get the sense that the author was a bitterly obsessed fan; always searching for stardom but only acheiving it through limited contact, then getting pissed when an 'A' list rock star doesn't wish him Happy Birthday."
1,Not worth it...get it out of the library.,"It's hard to believe this man is a huge fan of hard rock, when his his focus seems more on Bon Jovi (really??) and Pearl jam. Ugh. I used to read RIP back in the day and loved the mag....could this be the same man who represented it? Sad to say that there is nothing intresting in this book at all. NOTHING. I want to make it clear that I couldnt wait to read this book. What a jip. Think im too critical? Read it and tell me.....what planet rock is lonn talking about? It's not the planet rock where I dwell thats for damn sure!"
5,rock planet,great book if you like to know what is going on behind the scenes.very well described by the author.
5,Amazon purchase,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received the book ""Invitation To A Journey"". It is in really good condition. Whoever had it took care to preserve it. I have purchased used books from Amazon in the past and have been pleased with the results."
1,A Book to give over and over,"I picked up this book by chance in a bookstore not long after my brother, whose name by coincidence is Robert, passed away of cancer. I cried right there in the bookstore. This book takes the meaning of life and simplifies it to an allegory about lessons learned and why we are here in the first place without being overbearing. In a simple way, it brings life down to who do you love and who loves you. And it makes you realize that all of life is lesson after lesson. I have given it to so many friends and have read it over and over when I needed solace that things would trun out okay."
4,"Good Phone, Works as designed","We've had these handsets for about a month now and I can say that they do indeed work as advertised. Overall, we are quite pleased with them. They have an excellent range; they tend to work equally well in the house or outside. They do have some of the quirks that others have mentioned like the fact that any call not answered on the handset is considered a ""missed"" call but that is just an annoyance more than anything else.If you already have the base phone, and are looking to add some handsets for the bedroom or garage or whatever, these phones do the job."
2,Annoying Caller ID Problem and Disappointing Quality,"We bought the KX-TG5210M and the optional extra handset (KX-TGA520M) in Dec. 2004. The display on the option handset quit working in Jan. 2005. Like the other reviewer said, a phone that doesn't work is worthless. In addition, after answering a call on one of the handsets, the other handset (the one I didn't answer) shows a missed call even though I just answered it. This is annoying because you can't keep track of calls you missed because some of the calls shown as missed were actually answered."
4,Panasonic does it again,Good features: Light-up antenna; 5.8 GHz; caller ID/talking caller ID; built-in speakerphone; headset jack; belt clip; and NiMH battery for quick charging. The sound quality is great and has good range.
3,Panasonic KX-TGA520M -Needs better volume,"I have had this phone for several months. The volume control could be better, my Uniden phone has better volume so I can hear people though my headset. This panasonic phone only has 3 volume controls; low, medium and high.The talking caller ID could speak more clear."
3,technically challenged,I thought this would work with my panasonic system. I went to panasonic site to compare and get manual for my model and it appears this should work but so far I haven't figured it out. It requires full concentration and a block of time. I will keep trying. I may have to pay for tech support. I wish the description would have pointed out precisely which system would work with this. It also should have come with the former owners call numbers erased!
1,Unhappy Camper Refunded,"Product was shipped with a defective LCD. It initially would not register to the base station. When it did, the display grew dim and finally became unreadable. I returned the handset as defective and was immediately notified that the headset was out of stock and could not be replaced....DigiDeals offered a refund, I accepted and I received the refund about 2 weeks later."
2,dissatisfied,"i realize this was a used phone, but the talk and off buttons must be pushed just right to make a connection. for the price i was not that satisfied. thanks"
3,"Good material, presentation problematic","This is one of the latest guides on ice climbing. It therefore covers the most modern techniques, is up to date with equipment, and has great color photos. Written by Will Gadd it definitely has the flair of an individual author, reads more like a pro's guide than a technical reference. The type of material covered and order is great. However, the editing of this guide is severely lacking. It suffers from incorrect captions, bad figure references, transposed terms (convex vs concave) and complex procedures described in steps that tend to get you lost in confusion rather than clarify.If you're an already accomplished ice climber, there will be a few ""take home"" concepts (""tracking""/cycling vertical progression, and his personal take on mix climbing techniques for instance). A beginner will benefit more from this guide (after reading twice to work around the editing problems).A second edition, edited properly, will be a top-notch guide on this sport."
5,Great First Watch For A Child,"I purchased this watch for my 27-month old granddaughter. She is a Winnie the Pooh fan, and she loved the watch. It has an easy-to-read face and the watch band allows for ample adjustment and is comfortable for a small child. I can't comment on how durable the watch is, but my granddaughter loves it so far. If it lasts long enough for her to learn to tell time, it will have been worth the price."
3,Good Stand but No Feet!,"This stand is a perfect fit for the Porter Cable 691RS Ultimate Router Workshop, with which I bought it. Assembly was easy, and the stand sturdy as can be. The only problem (and it's considerable) is that it shipped without the rubber bushings (feet) that the directions said were included. So it slides. If the manufacturer comes through with the feet, it'll be a five for value and performance."
4,Pretty good,"What you get in the very compact box, is a set of steel beams, nuts, bolts, and rubber feet. In my case, all the parts were in the box- nothing amiss. Assembly instructions are not perfect, but it's not hard for a tool enthusiast to understand. With 15 to 30 minutes of your time, the parts all fit together perfectly and it makes for a VERY SOLID base to support your router table (or whatever machine you want to place on it). The rubber feet really keep it from moving around.The size and shape of the stand are well-suited to the Porter Cable Router Table-- it really is tip-proof; very heavy and solid.It really should have a few extra holes in the top plates, for mounting accessories. For example, I made a little wooden bracket to hold the Collet Wrench and Miter Guide. But it was very hard to drill two holes through the steel to mount my bracket! Otherwise, no complaints."
2,Arrived missing parts and instructions,"The stand (ordered Feb 3, shipped April 4!) arrived missing parts, instructions, and fasteners (bolts I assume). Porter-Cable was not very helpful, stating that they never ship tables like this and giving me the wrong phone number to contact Amazon.Amazon on the other hand was very helpful and immediately shipped a replacement. We'll see if it arrives with all pieces."
1,grossly overpriced,This brush is worth about 10 bucks. Anything more and you are throwing money down the drain.
1,"TEXT HEAVY, PHYSICALLY HEAVY, TOO.","The photographs in this book are beautiful, but the book itself is a heavy, cumbersome thing that weighs four pounds - making you reconsider having it shipped, or even trying to drag it home. The text, which there is a lot of, apparently was translated and reads awkwardly. It is printed in a too-small font that gives you a headache. My advice is to skip this one altogether, there many great decorating books out there."
3,Its Ok,"I bought this book as I thought it was the same one I had burrowed from the libary.. But it wasnt, its good, but I guess I should have checked more before I bought as it does not contain as much info as I wanted... Still a good buy though"
1,Junk- Do not buy,"The attachment won't lock into the motor body. The attachment will still spin when the motor is on, but it won't lock in place. I think the blades that lock in the attachment no longer come out far enough. I've tried about everything I can think of to fix it. Everything else about this immersion blender seem durable and well designed, but the attachment lock is one seriously weak link. I bought this for my wife for Christmas two years ago. She's probably used it ten times. Save your money."
2,"Good motor, Poor use of plastic","I bought this in 2008 and use it 1-3 times a week. The motor is still strong, but the drive shaft and gear box are made of plastic. The plastic is now stripped and can no longer turn the blade. I don't think it's ethical to manufacturer a critical moving part out of plastic that will inevitably wear out before the motor does. Last night I glued the parts together to hopefully keep this tool out of a landfill a little longer. I will then look for a different brand."
1,"Worked well, broke quickly -- twice","I've bought two of these. Both wore out fast despite light use. The same part failed both times - the plastic socket that connects the blade to the motor. The plastic used isn't strong enough; the socket gets stripped so that the motor spins without turning the blade. Maybe it deserved two stars instead of one, because until it breaks, it's good -- easy to clean and effective. If KitchenAid had cared enough to answer my e-mail about it, I'd have bumped it up a notch."
5,MacDaddy of hand blenders,"I have owned a couple of Braun hand blenders and for the most part, it does an excellent job. However when it comes to grating/chopping fresh coconuts (yes we use it a lot in our Indian cuisine), it struggles and have broken down in the past. This KitchenAid crushes the fresh coconut (the fruit inside the shell) without any problems. Also I ues it to blend smoothies for the kids from the grocery bought frozen packs. It works very well all the time. Same with fresh fruits too. This little gadget is amazing. Also my wife uses it for making fresh tomato sauce right inside the cooking stock pot. Chopping onions & fresh cilantro for salsas is a breeze with this tool."
2,Went through 2 in less then 2 years.,This blender worked well when it worked. Mostly used for making shakes and smoothies for the family. The problem is the motor doesn't last. The first one lasted about 6 months before it stopped working. Kitchenaid was very nice and sent a replacement unit but that one has lasted less then 9 months before the motor died. My typical usage would be around 2-3 times / week.After two bad units I think I will try another brand.
3,Motor drive coupler is weak,"The coupler in the motor for the mixer shaft doesn't last too long. It would be nice if this one weak part could be easily replaced, instead of having to buy a new motor/set. This part is available on the table top mixers."
4,"Great kitchen tool, needs to be repairable.","We have had this mixer for a couple of years for mixing everything from eggs, pancake mix, protein shakes, etc.My only complaint is storage. It does not like to have the cable wrapped around the device for storage. The power cable weakens at the connection and eventually breaks. There is no way to open the mixer and fix it. Luckily there was enough wire hanging out to splice(not safest fix). You should be able to open it up.Otherwise I will be buying another one and not wrapping the cord around it."
2,poor wear with non-metal contact points,"This product has plenty of power, but there was a ""slip"" feeling between the handle and blade connection and the rubber (not metal) moving parts wore out in 4 years with minimal use. Buy your blenders like your wands - metal on metal moving parts only!!"
5,KitchenAid Hand Blender,"Ordered the Hand Blender without problems... Product arrived ahead of schedule... Blender neatly packed in a styrofoam fitted box... Used all dial settings using soups, stocks & sauces [great results from purees to slightly chunky]... Cleaning is a snap since: the blending attachment can be separated from the motor body, dunked into soapy water, and dried off in the drain rack. Actually I paid more than I wanted but... I got more than what I paid for... It's a really cool device for those pea soup fans who make their own... All in all, I'm a happy camper!!! - Teo"
5,an excellent little boat motor,"ok, after 6 or so cheap models i finally broke down and bought a kitchenaid boat motor. power is a beautiful thing and after i wreck this one i will probably get another just like it."
3,"lasted, then busted","Out of the box, this hand blender was great. It lasted ten years. We almost never used it for a long time, then came our smoothie habit starting about three years ago. After a bunch (20) of smoothies made using frozen berries yogurt and bananas, the seal/plate behind the blades came loose, then after another ten or fifteen uses the head stopped engaging without being forced, then the shaft connection somehow gave up the ghost and now we're in the market for a new one.I'm not sure we could have found a better one, but its not ""for life"" as another reviewer said. if it were, I would not be here writing this."
1,Worked fine until the plastic disk came loose,"I had the same problem that other people had. The plastic disk that sits under the blade came loose and interferes with the chopping process. The result is tiny bits of grey plastic in my food. If that weren't disgusting enough, the disk is impossible to clean underneath. I was very pleased with this product until this happened. It doesn't take up much room, and it is easier to clean by hand than a regular blender, which are both amazing features. But this development means that mine is going in the trash. How disappointing."
2,Built in defective?,"We have had two of these. NO MORE! Both died after 13 months of very infrequent use and cost as much to fix as to replace; you must pay the shipping to the ""warranty"" (NOT) repair center and both would have cost the c. 38.00 USD flat rate to repair. Convenient to KitchenAid but not for THIS household any more!"
5,As recommened by Cooks Illustrated,"I bought this stick blender because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated. The price is good and the blender has plenty of power. We use it to make breakfast and/or dessert shakes daily as well as the occasional soup. Also, easy to clean. I've only had it about a month, but at this point I would definitely purchase it again."
2,It's Great Until It Breaks,"This blender is great, but unfortunately, is not built to last. Most of it is made of plastic, which wears away the more you use it."
1,cheap junk + weasel company,"I don't usually complain, but I feel compelled to warn other consumers about this mixer specifically and Kitchen Aid in general. I used to be a Kitchen Aid fan, but the only conclusion I can reach from my most recent experience is that they has joined the majority of appliance manufacturers producing cheap, disposable junk. Rather than resolve an issue with a long time customer, they refused to honor the warranty for the mixer.Our mixer stopped working the third time we used it. Motor runs, but the blades won't spin. I contacted Kitchen Aid through their website and asked them to repair or replace. They claimed it was more than a year old even though we'd just received it new in box as a gift. How's that for customer service?Any manufacturer can put out an occasional lemon, I won't hold that against them. The true measure of a company's integrity it in how it responds to a problem. Kitchen Aid = Weasel"
5,great wedding gift,"We got this for our wedding and it's great! Much more useful than a traditional blender, because it's easier to clean and you can use it with any container. Today I used it to blend a potato-lentil soup in the pot. I would have never used a traditional blender for this, and a potato masher will make the soup chunky. A few short pulses were enough for a good consistency. This is a great item to put on your registry."
5,Well worth the price,"Like some other reviewers have mentioned, this is a huge step up from the old one-speed stick mixer I'd previously used. Let me count the ways. First, it offers way more speeds than I've seen on any other kitchen appliance (9!?). Second, the detachable element is a big bonus for cleaning. Third, it feels much sturdier and stronger than my old plastic model, and fourth, the price was unbeatable."
1,KitchenAid Hand Blender,"Pro: liquifies cooked food very well.Con: heavy, has a short cordLast straw: the rubber seal around the blade shaft came loose and allows food to get in underneath. Its impossible to clean now so I can't use it, even though it is still working. I've only had it a year or so.I will not be buying a KitchenAid replacement."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,The rubber around the blade came off into my soup. It actually shredded itself into my soup. We didn't realize this into we were well into eating the soup. We ate lots of little pieces of grey rubber. This happened only the second time I used this blender. This is a defective and terrible product.
3,"Good, but food gets trapped in the shaft","This is our second hand held blender. The first one died too early, but we liked using it so much for our morning smoothies that we bought another. This one is working ok, but like other reviewers stated, the rubber seal came loose and trapped food. The seal is not removable because of the blades. Food gets in the shaft and is next-to-impossible to clean. The seal was just loose enough to trap food, and not noticeable at first. By the time we noticed it, food had dried was stuck about 1/4"" up the shaft. We still use it, but it requires tedious methods to clean and keep sanitary. We're hoping Kitchenaid addresses this issue in subsequent models. It's a great blender, but buyer beware."
1,Buy this if you like plastic in your soup,There is a plastic disc separating the blade from the shaft of the attachment. After several uses the plastic disc falls down and gets chopped up by the blade as you are blending. There were chunks of plastic all over the last batch of soup that I blended.
3,"Nice design, needs more power","This blender is easy to hold and use, looks nice and work well on ligher items. We tried to use it to blend sweet potatoes for a casserole, something we did often with our Cuisinart blender, and it immediately bogged down and overheated."
5,Variable Speed Hand Blender,"I have not used this blender much, since I just bought it, but it seems to be a quality product so far."
2,"Bought it cheap, not the best choise","Don't like to use it. Very hard to store, you can't hold it, and doesn't do a good job, the only good thing that is quiet"
2,Good product; horrible anti-environmental packaging,"This is my first immersion blender, but I am impressed with its capabilities so far. I do like the multi-speed options and it seems to be a sturdy little instrument.The packaging, however, is a crime against the earth!! I would never have bought it, had I known that it came sandwiched between two huge nonbiodegradeable slabs of styrofoam. This aspect of the product seriously brings down its star rating in my book.Amazon, you too, put on an offensive packaging show. The KitchenAid box was packed in a huge box, many times larger than the purchased product, and stuffed with non-recyclable plastic. :("
2,Works great but breaks somehow easily,"I owned this blender for more than 2 years. Not long after purchasing I noticed the plastic piece under the blades came lose and stay lose. No way to push it back or anything. Anyhow, it continued to work... until the plastic piece that attaches to the motor worn out so the motor spins but the blender does not. Some reviewers experienced exactly the same issues.Now, for the value, it is up to you. After all, it did last me 2 long years of heavy usage (2-3 times a week for soup and a special banana ice cream) always on max power.However bottom line for me it is disappointing that Kitchen Aid does not offer replacement for the blender portion... making me throw away a perfect, functioning motor. Where is their sustainability message? Hello Kitchen aid, anyone there?"
1,Motor stopped working in 40 days,It was a great product to prepare food for my baby (I haven't used it that much except for blending some boiled veggies 1-2 times day). BUT it stopped working in 40 days. I can't return also as Amazon's return policy is only for 30 days.
1,Don't buy this kitchen aide immersion blender,"Terrible. Gunk gets stuck in the shaft, you can't clean it. But it comes out in your food. I had to throw mine out."
4,"So far, so good.","I've been using this hand blender for the last couple months...wanted to give it some time and many uses before writing a review. Very fast to chop/puree with all the varying and convenient speeds, and very easy to clean. When using the blending container provided, you'll be much better off with ""deeper"" blending...a couple inches or more of liquid and ingredients. For more ""shallow"" blending like herbs and some olive oil, for example, you'll be OK but will need to use a more narrow container for best results.Wish the cord was a bit longer, and for the price, I wish a couple incidental attachments were provided. But other than that, I really don't have many major complaints. A very solid and dependable product."
1,Unplayable,"Try getting past level 2 of this game. It sure ain't easy. You can stomp on thousands of bugs to earn enough vouchers to buy tons of lives, but who wants to go through that? And if you run out of scares when you get to a boss, you're screwed. There's no other attacks you can use to hurt bosses, and you can't buy more scares, so you just have to die. And in that case, all the lives in the world won't get you through the game. Its just poorly designed. The only fun thing about it is when you get killed, sometimes your skull bounces off an enemy and kills it too. Other than that, this game has no redeeming value. Definitely one of the worst I've ever played, and I've played a lot of bad ones."
1,Was this published by Vanity Press?,"Bad poetry. While some of the poems cover mature topics, they are all juvenile in content. Buy something great from Amazon, like Knut Hamsun's 'Mysteries' or 'Hunger'. Trust me, you'll thank me for this advice!"
5,Good Product,A good price for a good product that is made in the USA. I will definite buy it here again.
4,ACCEPTABLE,The order and delivery service was terrific.The package contained about 5-10% swollen biscuits and about 1% flaked biscuits but rest were great and worth the sale price.
2,"Clearly not ""The Ultimate Guide""","I don't see how anybody could call this book the Ultimate Guide to Becoming a Teacher. The subject matter is quite narrow. It really doesn't say much about earning a teaching credential. This book is for people wanting to get a Masters Degree in teaching. If you only want a teaching credential, and don't want to spend the extra time and money right away getting a Master's degree, this book is almost useless. Most of the book is a nationwide directory of colleges where you can earn a Master's Degree in Education. Also, this book covers the whole country, so it doesn't say much about how to become a teacher in any particular state. Every state has a different system. If you want to earn a Master's Degree in teaching, this book will probably be helpful to you, but it's definitely not the Ultimate Guide to Becoming a Teacher."
3,Geared toward grad students,"Being interested in becoming a teacher, I ordered this book, but I suppose I didn't look too carefully (or should have looked more carefully), as this book is geared more toward college graduates who are looking to go to graduate school for an education degree. There's some interesting info for about 50 or so pages at the beginning, to give a background on being a teacher, and some indexes of payscales per state, but the majority of the book lists graduate schools of education per state."
3,Shelcore,"Little boys love this toy. It makes noises when you turn the wheels and the monkey. My little one doesn't use it as a car. But, he does enjoy taking the tools out and trying to fix other cars."
1,Featureless disappointment,"My two year old keeps trying to remove the wheels from every car he owns, so I had hoped to find one where the wheels were supposed to come off, and he could use the tools to put them back on. Alas, this is not that toy. The screwdriver, hammer, and wrench come out of the truck. You can use the screwdriver and wrench to turn the ""hubcap"" area of the wheel, but the wheels do not come off. And, it's hard for little hands to manage even that much. Deep grooves around the hubcap might have helped him keep the screwdriver in there while he turns, but those are absent and he isn't capable of doing anything with it at all, except pushing it across the floor. So if you want a generic car to push across the floor and a few plastic tools, this might be great. But don't expect anything else."
5,How much I love this book by Stacy Bergin,"The Sex Pistols were one of the fore-fathers of punk rock in the U.K. This book chronicles the chaos and anarchy that ensued on their failed 1978 tour of America. From Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious getting their first taste of America's police, to Paul Cook and Steve Jones' beautifully obscene appearence on a local radio show, this book tells it all. It even has a ""Where are they now"" part in the back. This book is the closest anyone will ever get to hearing of the Sex Pistols tour. I wasn't born yet, (not until 1982), and I felt as if I was right there with them, because the book engrosses you. It's a definite page turner, one that you just can't put down, because you're always wondering about something. ""Is Sid going to die of withdrawl?"" ""Will Paul kill himself?"" ""Is Johnny going to blow up in everyone's face?"" ""Is Sid ever going to bathe?"" It's all here. I recommend it highly"
5,Great read!,I read this in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. Great anecdotes from the road (and priceless pictures). Well written.
4,"Funny, interesting, and a great resource for fans","Since Noel Monk was actually on the tour with the Sex Pistols in the US, this book is full of first hand incidents and conversations. Not to mention the fantastic pictures included. If you are a Sid Vicious and/or a Sex Pistol fan, this is a must have!"
4,"The Sex Pistols wanted to be cowboys, but the cowboys didn't want to be Sex Pistols","One of my favorite anecdotes about Sid Vicious is from ""Please Kill Me,"" where he's singing Jim Reeves' songs, drunk in a stairwell. Punk and roots music aren't that far removed, and the Sex Pistols on paper should have been huge in the south, populated by their supposed target audience- poor, angry people who love music at a gut level, but they were just too alien for most good 'ol boys."
1,Terrible,"This book is horrible. Previous to this I read ""Lydon 's Rotten- No Irish...."". This book contradicts Lydons account in so many ways and it was written by the roadie with absolutely no help from the band. Some of it is absolutely ridiculous. For instance, the section where sid and jonny first encounter american cops who harrass them and the book says something like ""the pistols had never seen anything like this in england"" and the guys got really scared and believed that the cops were going to shoot them. Give me a break! There are no jerk cops in england????? I highly doubt that. And the way the story makes such a hero out of the road manager... Who cares? Gee whiz, he made it through 12 whole days with the pistols.... and wrote a crappy book about it much less!!! This book also never finalizes quite a few issues. I completely agree with the other 1 star review on this page. Avoid this book."
2,Almost all wrong.,"Most of the tracks are mis-named and the last one ,Nobody Knows The Trouble I`ve Seen, isn`t even listed! Why??"
2,Few pages torn off and CD is missing. Seller did not notify customers.,"I decided to buy this book because it's price was $8 less than the bookstore. But it was not worth it. This book should come with a CD but I found it's missing when I received the item. I had to copy from my classmate's CD. The seller put the condition as 'good' but the book is almost falling apart. Several pages were torn off, making it very difficult to read and carry around."
4,First purchase-Business Logistics,"satisfied with the time frame in which I received the book I ordered. Also very pleased with the condition of the product, although the book I order was used it is in good condition, this is in line with what was advertised."
3,Two-star penalty for redundancy,"This is a terrific set in terms of packaging and presentation, but I'm with the man who said that those games which are already available on DVD shold have been replaced. Personally, I would much rather have had Ron Guidry's 18Ks game in its entirety... and what about the Graig Nettles Show, a.k.a. Game 3 of the '78 Series? I'm glad to have this set for the previously unreleased games, but I object slightly to the repackages...still, these are the ones the fan voted for, and Vox publicum, vox dei, right?"
3,just roll up your sleaves and do it,Enjoying the book though he talks to you in a way that takes some getting used to because of the language/cultural difference.
3,where has esham been?,"every time a natas or esham cd comes out i buy it without hesitation. dead flowers, closed casket, gothom city and doubeliveingod, are some of my favorite cds. however, starting with mail dominance i havent liked any of the esham/natas cd's that much. sayin that i think godlike is the best esham/natas cd seince multikillonare. godlike is much better than www.com. but all these new esham/natas cd's are nothin like his old stuff. their tracks get generic and the production is not up to spec. esham's flow is still tight but he and mastamind and tnt say tha same stuff over and over."
2,Truly a step back.....,"What could have been a potentially great album got tied up in record label B.S. (with Gothom Overcore going bankrupt) and essentially, just kinda got pushed out there because it was promised. It just seems like they mailed the album in without putting any real heart or effort into it. The beats, while somewhat creative as a whole, all sound the same and the songs and lyrics just get repeatitive. It's just sorta boring. Natas is a very talented group and the talent shows regardless, but in comparison to anything they've put out before, it just comes across as half-hearted and rushed."
3,Not the best work,"3 years after Natas's AMAZING WWW.com, comes Godlike. While all their past work seemed to be a big improvement over previous records, this one is a let-down. The whole album kind of sounds the same, the chouruses are pretty weak, and the raps have degenerated into your typical gangster-posing. There are a few good songs on the album but they are few and far between. ""godlike"" AND ""how u could get more cheddar"" are pretty good. Whereas they used to have an amped-up, real-life, unique type of sound, they are starting to sound like alot of other rap bands out there. The 3 or 4 good songs on the album might make it worth the purchase for Esham or Natas fans, but as a whole, its not very good."
2,Buy It Anyway,"Own a piece of history: The first bad Natas album.This album is full of dreadful moments, I can not even begin to say. It is so unlike them, usually. I mean, sure, Esham/Natas have always been notorious for rehashing old lines, or leaving bars empty. But, this is just bad. Sounds like it was unfinished.Now, there is a reason for every season, and this came directly after the D12 conflict, so you know where I am going w/ that.Still, own it for the history."
3,What happened?,"I know that Natas could have done a lot better than this. Even though they half-assed it, it still sounds better than any mainstream album out there. Godlike is just missing something that made all the other albums great. The best song on here is ""N-A-T-A-S"". Other than that, all the other songs are just okay. Only get this album if you are a true fan. Hopefully if they put out another album, they'll take the time to make it better than this one."
3,Not recommended for Liaden fans,"I bought this based on others saying it's a good book for fans of the Liaden novels by Lee and Miller. Sadly I must disagree.The Liaden novels are set in a richly detailed universe, with complex but not confusing stories, well-drawn and unique characters, and romance of the heart and spirit.This is set in a generic and thin universe, with a simple story, interesting main characters but cardboard cutouts for the rest of the cast, and a romance that seems mostly based on the flesh. It's a decent book, but not even close to the same caliber as the Liaden novels."
2,Literary marshmallow,"Pretty, spunky, scrappy heroine. She's smart! She's tough! She's a good mechanic! She's a clever programmer! She flies around the universe by herself in her dilapidated space ship. She meets an injured soldier. He's handsome! Taut! Saturnine! Mysterious! Initially, they dislike each other, but somehow they keep accidentally stumbling into each other's arms. Where will it all lead?"
1,Beam It Down!,"Yuck. A badly written romance novel with a pinch of science fiction thrown in to fool the unwary SF fan. Rotten story, unbelievable characters, ridiculous and confusing political situation, and a cutesy C3PO knockoff from Star Wars. As far as the romance goes, it it unbelievable and badly handled. As far as the science fiction aspect goes, it reminds me of lemonade made with half the amount of mix that the recipe calls for--dull, dilute & making your wonder why you're wasting your time on it. I read the first 1/4 of this dog & then skimmed the rest just say I'd finished it. Now I wish I'd saved myself the disagreeable experience. Do NOT waste your time on this!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This was the worst kind of science fiction. Romance was the driving factor of the story, instead of an aspect of a bigger whole. The reasons stated for the character's actions seldom seemed believable, and the science was non-existent."
4,Simple crisp read,"I found this to be a good read. The characters had depth and the plot lines didn't trip over themselves. yes, the sci fi falls into female Han Solo type but nothing wrong with that. Its not a complex socio/political counter look at modern problems though a sci looking glass. But the auther has taken the time to invent a good back drop to set her tale against. Sinclair needs a little work on her combat narrative but still good over all.If you liked the Debra Doyle mageworld series or or a simpler Elizabeth Moon type book then you will enjoy this."
4,Finder's Keepers,"I really enjoyed this one, more than I thought I would. If you like Science Fiction with a splash of romance you'll like this book.Trilby is on a deserted planet, making repairs to her ship when Rhis pretty much falls into her lap. Although she has reason to be, Trilby is a bit crabby for a good chunky of the book. At times her attitude was a bit annoying, but I loved her character anyway. Both Rhis and Trilby's characters make for a wonderful story.This was my first time reading anything by Linnea Sinclair, it was a nice change from vampires and werewolves (not that I'm giving up on them anytime soon.) but, I am looking forward to reading her other books. Finders Keepers as far as I can tell is a stand-alone novel."
5,Dazzling,"This book proves that Sci-Fi can indeed exist in union with Futuristic Romance. And that-gasp!-a good space adventure can document two people falling in love. It even has room for well-done sexual tension. In addition to the romantic plot, FINDERS KEEPERS has: disreputable freighter pilots, `droids with attitudes, Heroes that are beyond human but are also endearingly human, space battles, asteroid fields, battleships and space stations, trans-galactic jump gates, arrogant corporate scum, and inter-galactic politics. You want it? It's there.Ride with Trilby and Rhis on a roller-coaster of political and financial machinations and against an amazing backdrop of life in deep space. Author Sinclair's prose is tight and intense. You'll feel as though you are in the cockpit, the ship's controls in your hands, speeding through space with your hair on fire. It's firmly placed on the shelf marked, ""Touch this and Die."""
3,3 1/2 stars (mostly the bookstores fault),"I liked the book. However, I believe that is a book that deserves a wider audience, but the author has limited its readability by adding some disjointed elements. I picked it up in the science fiction section and was disappointed in the romance elements. It is not that those elements were bad, but they seemed to hold up the story because the writing style changes at those points. Any die-hard sci-fi reader would love the non-romance parts and even the sexual tension. However, most of my guy friends and some of the other women, if they had gotten the book out of sci-fi, would have been very upset when they hit those few romance elements!"
1,Not SciFi,"I really don't mind a bit of romance in SciFi, otherwise I wouldn't have enjoyed Miles Vorkosigan series or Liaden series. However, this is practically pure romance and worse, predictable and cliche romance.I've picked this and another book by Linnea Sinclair (games of command) since they ended up on many lists which contain books I liked. I actually wondered at some places whether I am reading the same book. Short, blonde, spunky green eyed heroine and tall muscular dark hero, intensely attracted to each other, have lots of misunderstandings because he is a supersoldier lab product, and she is ashamed of her origin. Eventually of course there is a happy ending, after lots of ""action"" which doesn't make sense, with poor descriptions of politics, enemies, and battles. Blech."
4,Breakout talent,"The first third of the book is a stereotypical romance-novel in its structure and the internal dialogue of its characters. All the tired cliches are trotted out, and truly, much of it could be borrowed unchanged from ANY romance novel on the shelf. The sex is a tad subdued for a romance novel, but there are supermarket shelves devoted to exactly this level of graphic expression. SciFi details are present but irrelevant, in this part of the book.In the second half, though, the author broke out of the mold and impressed me with an interesting plot and (mostly) believable character development. Tivahr's personality changes too radically in a short time, perhaps, but ah! That's the power of love.Also, the 'Sko and Dezi were never described at all (unless I blinked and missed it). We want to picture things in our heads, and that made it pretty darned difficult."
2,Ehh,"Mediocre writing. Orthodox pot boiler. Ragen writes about this culture and while some of it is accurate, it is overwrought and gives a very superficial view of the culture."
5,Shocking eye opener!,"I could not stop reading this book.Naomi Regan reveals the true twisted world of the orthodox Jews. A world that has the same rules no matter where the orthodox Jewish community choses to grow.The crooked interpretation of the bible, chauvinism, disrespect of woman, and primitive way of seeing the reality.The powerless individual who wants to have a taste of a less restricted world facing the horrors of what the society believes is right.Naomi Regan makes the reader understand how much better the orthodox Jewish world could be, had it not been ruled by so much brain washing and primitivity."
4,A compelling peek into an unknown world,"This novel gets 3 stars for literary style and 5 for content and sociological details. Even though the writing is not stellar and the plots and characterization can be predictable, you keep turning the pages anyway! Ragen makes a world that most of us know little about seem utterly real and sometimes almost physically oppressive. Read The Sacrifice of Tamar first, as that's her best!"
5,Sotah,One of the best books I have ever read. Just ordered one as a gift for a lady who is 97 years old and I know she will love it also.
1,Author Naomi Ragen Convicted of Plagiarism,"A Jerusalem court has found American-Israeli author Naomi Ragen guilty of plagiarism, a verdict she called a ""dark day"" for writers in Israel.Ragen, a religious Zionist woman who has written against hareidim and is known for opposing their position on feminist issues, was said to have copied portions of Sarah Shapiro's ""Growing Up with My Children"" and inserted them in her own novel, Sotah."
3,Difficult to rate,"There are so many wonderful reviews of this book that I just HAD to read it. I gave it only 3 stars because I felt it moved along too slowly even though that was probably intentional. However, by page 245, I found it so horribly depressing that I decided not to read any more. I guess each reader will feel differently about the facts of this story and must make her/his own decision about whether or not to read this book."
1,laugahable,"From the reviews alone, this author's research of her main subject seems laughably inadequate. As a research novelist myself, I take great pains to thoroughly understand my material -- but sadly, it seems that Ms. Ragen did not care to do the same. Dowries? Women forced into arranged marriages? Moral police? Where was the author mining for her material, the previous century? These behaviors might have occurred in Jewish circles in centuries past -- as well as most of the rest of the world at that time, for that matter -- but today are only exhumed as tired jokes on sloppily researched movies, or books like these. For shame.Ms. Ragen does both her readers and society at large a great disservice by presenting the Jewish orthodox community as endorsing these outdated mores. Good writing begins with good research. I find myself utterly disgusted by this writer's lack of respect for her readers and will not be pursuing her work in the future."
3,Great But Listing is not Complete,"After doing two albums on a minor label (one which has been transferred to CD), Peter Allen recorded this unique album featuring his own version of ""I Honestly Love You"" which he wrote for Olivia Newton John.In addition to the major artists there's a full orchestra and a chorus as well. ""Everything Old is New Again"" is a classic!"
5,LOL ROTFLMAO,"This book is laugh out loud funny. These folks have clearly been lawyers - they use the style and multiple synonyms of lawyers perfectly - do lawyers get paid by the word? - but they also are funny in a way that works for everyone.A contract about whether the peanut butter stays in the fridge, whether the toilet paper rolls from the top or the bottom? Were the listening in my house?"
4,Classic country,"This is a nice collection of classic-style country songs by Kevin Denney. The album was a top 15 hit on the US Country chart when it was released in 2002 and produced two top 40 country hits, ""That's Just Jessie"" (which peaked at 16 on the Country singles chart and crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100 chart reaching 76) and my favorite ""Cadillac Tears"". A third singles just missed making the Country Top 40, the ballad ""It'll Go Away"". Denney has a nice country voice and obvious talent; I am not sure why a second album by him has yet to be released. But this is a nice collection of songs."
2,same old new country no rhythm.,"I heard Cadillac Tears on the internet so I thought I'd check out the cd. After checking out the songs I figured I'd pass on the cd. The only one that has individuality is ""Cadillac Tears"". The rest are all the same old new country ballads. I will download CTs and be happy."
3,Afghans for the older set,"I purchased this book based on the rave reviews, but after looking at it I think I will return it. The inside cover reads that the patterns are based on the best patterns collected over the past 60 years -- and they're not kidding. The book is a collection of patterns published by the Red Heart yarn company. The patterns are, in a word, dated. When I heard ""crochet classics"" I thought it meant timeless, but actually it means ""old fashioned."" I'm in my late 20's and I like simple, modern designs--this book just wasn't for me. Although a few of the patterns are very nice, the majority of the patterns are not to my taste. The book does not only have afghan patterns, but also also a few hideous 80's sweaters."
5,Best deal I could find due to the free super saver shipping,"I searched the web for several hours and I checked local store prices. Since shipping is FREE here and there's NO sales tax, this was the best deal.I was also VERY pleasantly surprised by the prompt Fed Ex delivery. I expected it to take at least a week, but they delivered way out in the boonies only two business days after I ordered.We use it to keep critters out of the veggie garden and will be ordering more."
3,great for a little girl,As a child I loved this game. This is mostly for younger children. It is an adventure game. It's about Barbie and her adventures through a toy store. All I can remember is the beach balls that would kill me. Great memories. Your little kid will love it.
3,No answer key,"They have great questions to the chapters, but there are no answer sheet with the correct answers for the question. I like everything else on this book, but not answer key."
5,The #1 manual for a future professional truck driver.,"Bumper to Bumper is the text I have used in the classroom of the largest truck school chain on the west coast for nearly five years. I have recently had the opportunity to compare it to the other PTDIA endorsed workbook. Bumper to bumper presents more information, it is easier for the students to understand, the proofreaders seem to know a thing or two about trucks, there are very few mistakes. The other ""PTDIA"" workbook (what can I say they have the PTDIA logo on the cover) is useless compared to Bumper to Bumper. Naturally I have left my old employer as they have taken the less-effective, but much cheaper, text and done many other things that have lowered the quality of student training. Bumper to Bumper is the best text for the professional driver who wants to understand new developments in the industry too."
4,Bumper to Bumper: the review,"Bumper to Bumper walks the reader through the various parts of a ""Big Rig"" showing the reader how a tractor trailer operates, how to""hookup"" and drive an 18 wheeler, and the necessary paperworkthat is required by the government.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in entering the transportation industry."
2,No personality,"I've never been a big ""command"" person, so don't take this to heart, but this robot has NO personality, and I can't stand that! If you want something with personality, you should try I-Cybie, the Robodog. it listens to commands, to, plus recharges itself, gets up when it falls over, has a little personality, matures from a puppy to a dog, and acts like a normal dog should. It's a better buy for people with my taste."
2,boring toy,The worst thing about this toy is that all it does is go forwards. There is no remote control. It's a dumb toy.
2,umm ok,this is sort of ok but is nothing near what i expected and i dont no if i would buy another.it doesnt really do much.But if you have a very young child that cant understand the normal one this one is great it is a very good piece to a collection if you use it for show whit other robosapien.overall its ok for show or a yong one not for an adult or hacker of robosapiens.
2,If you knowm whats good for your face you won't get this,"I'm plaing about that,but don't get this,the first 4 days it's cool with the walking,dancing,burping,and whisling, but thats basicly it.It's stupied.I rather get the raptor one."
2,MINI ROBERSAPEIN,"This robot moves it's hands, or should I say fingers, the eyes turn red and even has a shield to pull down over the eyes and it walks. It is ok on flat floor, but not on shag carpet, or it will fall over, the problem is it just does not have enough weight to keep it upright, so it won't fall over on carpet, and it is small. I do not recommend this robot WOw Wee. Jim in Ohio"
3,Boy toy,"Its batteries quickly died. Then I trod on it and its leg fell off. The boys love it though. In fact, they prefer it with one leg."
5,"Love, love, love!",Bought the mini Robosapien for my 4 year old twin boys Robot Birthday Party and it was a huge hit. All the kids played with this little guy and my boys have played with him every day since. Love it!... great deal and a lot of fun for just over $10.
4,its not every thing,this toy is OK it only walks it pick stuff up but i also would like to know why dose it say a fusion of personalty and technolgy i mean it only walks i recomend this toy a bit just a bit but its ok if you do have enogh money get mini roborapter
5,Bikits Bikits Bikits,"I have been using the Porter-cable plate joiner for about 4 months. I ran out of the Porter-cable biscuits right in the middle of a project on a sunday afternoon. My regular shop was closed so I bought a ""generic"" brand of biscuits at the local mega home destruction center just to finish the day. What a mistake. Most of these things did not fit due major variations in thickness and poor quality. Most would split when tapped into place. I ended up throwing away 2/3 rds of these defective biscuits. I have never had any problems with the Porter-Cable biscuits. These are always high quality, consistent thickness and much stronger. My daughter says they taste better also !"
3,It is what it is....,"I was handed down a fat box of Nes games. I did not pay for this game nor do i think I would. I guess for its time its decent. you get to drive in big trucks rooting, in drag events, and a few other things. didn't hold my attention to long but fun to see what was available while I was too young to game. worked perfectly fine in my yobo."
2,Save your money,I didn't notice any significant difference in my skin after a month of use every night. I recommend saving your money for something else. However I do like their make-up (i.e. their blush in rose color is really nice and natural)
2,Expensive dusting,I haven't noticed a difference using this product. It wasn't great for my acne and didn't cover much (I ordered medium).
4,The weirdest and best product ever,"I never thought I would want to put minerals on my face after I washed it and went to bed. But...this stuff really works. I'm always amazed at how much better my oily (occasionally adult acne) face looks the next morning. It is pricey, but very worth it and lasts a long time. My only complaint is the applicator. After a while it's hard to get the minerals to come out of the puff. They used to send an extra puff, but no longer."
2,how am i supposed to use this?,I received the rare minerals and am not sure how to use it. I twisted it to open and had to beat it against my hand to get anything to look like it may have some coverage aspect. I received a seperate buffing sleeve and not sure what to do with it???that's what i got...so how do I use this and what is the extra sleeve for?
4,Nightly Facial,"I have not been using this product for long, but so far I can see small changes in my complexion, i.e. smaller pores across my nose which has been a problem since getting ""older"". Plus, it's nice to be able to put this on after removing make-up, and knowing that if unexpected guests drop in that I don't look like a ""plain Jane"". My only complaint is that I wish it were a little less expensive."
5,How did we live before Bare Escentials?,I love this stuff! I found BE during the summer of 2007 - my dearest friend continued to sell me on it by saying how good it was for your skin. She wasn't kidding! I use to hate doing my make-up & now I realize it was because it made my skin feel 'icky'. BE is the farthest thing from 'icky'!!!! This product in particular is amazing - I saw improvements with in a day (& I have moderately adult acne prone skin)!
1,It was expired!,"I received this product, used it for 2 months, no difference with use. Noticed a label was covering another on the bottom(cleverly placed), both were just like the other, but the one covered, was expired for over a year before the purchase date.Very unsatisfied, will not purchase again, go on eBay & buy WaterLillies. I switched 4 months ago & my skin is clear & perfect! Bare minerals I used for almost 2 years prior, & it improved my skin, but only by a little. When I didn't wear it (even for 1 day) I'd break out & start over. With WaterLillies, I didn't wear it for 2 weeks while horribly sick, still perfect skin. No change in diet. Just continued use of their product!"
1,Does nothing,"After reading praises for Bare Minerals and falling for their advertising, I thought I would try this. After two weeks of use, it does absolutely nothing. A complete waste of money."
1,Bare Escentuals RareMinerals,"I like all my other BE products but the RareMinerals not so much. I saw no benefit and at the high price, I should have."
4,"Twinkle , sway .","Absolutely darling , wearable by young and all but...nah , the old too . Reasonable price as well ."
1,came in broken,"This item came in smashed, but it was no hassle at all to return it and get another different unit."
1,Also Received Broken,"Just wanted to advise that I received my PV-20DF25 shortly before Christmas 2006. Although the shipping box showed no damage, the TV inside had taken a hard hit. The console was cracked and the picture tube was loose and flopping around inside. I had no return or refund problems. Hmmmm?"
5,A book for anyone who has ever felt second best.,"As a former wrestler, and current Head Wrestling Coach at a high school, I highly reccommend this book to anyone involved in the sport. Through the mind of Ben, it is easy to understand, or in my case, remember, the thoughts and feelings of a teenage athlete. I often refer to this book to modify my own coaching. I use the emotional struggles that Ben had to better identify with my athletes. Although this book is about wrestling, I feel that it would be excellent for all students, teachers, and parents. Rich Wallace does a great job of portraying small town life and making you think about your own decisions in life, past and future.. Basketball has ""Hoosiers"". Everyone else has ""Wrestling Sturbridge""."
4,An exciting read for teens,"Ben, a high school senior and varsity wrestler is starting to realize that his future is pretty bleak. His hometown of Sturbridge, PA is small and dismal and known only for it's Wrestling team and the cinder block factory. So in his last season of wrestling, ben shakes off the fear and challenges the status quo. He chooses not to continue as the training partner of his best friend, Al(the wrestling teams best hope for a state title: instead Ben makes a bit for the title. Robert Cormier writes of the novel: ""Ben wrestles no only his high school opponents but with the big issues of life and love and the choices a teenager must make."" You won't be able to stop turning pages of this one.When you're finished with this one, try _Shots on Goal_."
4,A good book for any youth or high school wrestler,"I read Wrestling Sturbridge, but this sounds like the same book (maybe an earlier edition) I have 4 sons who wrestle and anyone who loves the sport of wrestling knows the joys and heartaches. Especially for those athletes who are not the Varsity, A-Team, or Champions - it certainly teaches about the desire to win and wanting to have a spot on the team!"
3,Nice wrestling book,"A good story about a boy who decides to challenge his own best friend in order to achieve some of his personal goals. I liked it, but my personal favorite book about high school wrestling, more realistic about the sport and with higher stakes for the hero, is ""Takedown."""
2,"Good overview, new age slant, not much detail.","The book is quite good. It gives a good overview of the different possible injuries and techniques for preventing them. It does has a very `new age, holistic ' slan, and sometimes seems to discourage traditional (scientific) approaches. It has been written with the lay person in mind, and doesn't go into too much depth in the medical discussions.Although I enjoyed the book, I can't help feeling that at by the end of the book I hadn't really learnt anything new."
4,This was given as a gift,I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it and has already begun making items for her business
1,The worst craft book ever,"This book is heavy on the art history references, and light on actual creative ideas. I guess the idea was to link the projects with well-known artists' styles, but it's overly wordy and these links are loose and uninteresting. The projects were totally lame and, without photos or drawings on most of them, hard to imagine or get interested in. The graphic design is even more banal, in fake typewriter font and two-color printing that's not even utilized well. A better version would have cut the copy by half (or more) and put in photos of the projects (or, come on throw us a bone--even a drawing of each one!) though some were so stupid even that wouldn't save them. Save your money."
5,"Innovative ideas, many of which are very lovely","I *love* this book! Although most ""starving artists"" books are filled with garbage I wouldn't want in my basement, this one includes many innovative, attractive ideas that would enhance any setting.There are numerous economy projects that no one would dream of making, giving, or displaying unless truly desperate. But there at least as many (probably many more) that would enhance any setting, and be welcome gifts.This book has something for virtually everyone. I love it!"
5,Help for the Hapless,"Best gift I have ever received! It is teeming with great ideas!For a hopelessly square, artistically challenged, straight arrow like me, this book is a godsend. Now, I can act out my fantasy of living the bohemian life, and I don't have to bother with smoking unfiltered cigarettes, wearing a black beret, growing a goatee, moving to Williamsburg (Brooklyn), and snapping my fingers at free-form poetry readings. I just have to do a few of these easy art projects, leave the results lying around my house, and voila! Instant Hip.And, of course, the best part of it all is that I don't have to spend a lot of money on art school in the process.My favorite ideas were the ""bread-n-jam mini layer cakes"" and the ""brocolli stem pickles"" - I have learned that the way to my inner ""starving"" artist is through my stomach."
3,"great SOUNDING projects, but...","This book coulda' tossed in a few pictures of completed projects. This book didn't have a single photo to inspire or guide. Sometimes you just need to see it done to know it's possible!But - that aside, I like the ideas inside. Gonna pick one out & start soon..."
5,The find of an important aircraft!,"This is a great story of a mans desire to gain posession of this ""Hawker Hurricane #R4118"" fighter. It makes for a very interesting read to follow along the frustrating path he must take to aquire this rare plane. The book details the pilots who flew this exact plane and their missions during the Battle of Britain era. It also covers the incredible restoration of this fighter back to flying status, with plenty of color photos throughout. A great book for anyone interested in WWII aircraft or restoration. I really enjoyed it!"
2,cantankerous pedometer,"I bought this pedometer a week ago from another retailer. It is very difficult to program, and the directions are poorly written. So, I am on line shopping for another model."
3,"Awesome buoyancy, but NO leash!!","You can't pick the color of the board, and it doesn't come with a leash, or even a hole to feed the leash through. Guess I should have paid more attention to the pictures! Hope you have the tools and skills to install your own leash. Otherwise, it's the most buoyant boogie I ever owned, and i'm 210 pounds! Great starter board for a big guy!"
5,Loved It,The cast was fantastic. The lyrics were a cynics' delight. A look into politics and newspapers that still has relevance. The music was and is hummable and delightful.
1,Now I understand,"""Of Thee I Sing"" was considered landmark in its day. It is the sort of piece that one can no longer appreciate. Imagine Gershwin not being terribly imaginative. Here he sounds like a hack composer just pumping it out. But they were trying something different. They were trying to make something much closer to an opera. There is tons of recitative but it just isn't very interesting and the humor is very labored. This is one to get from the library and not worth purchasing. You will listen to it once at most. I didn't have the patience to listen to the whole thing. Still, imagine a time when people were trying to be different."
5,THE BEST!!,When I was given this book by a friend I was skeptical - I've read so many vampire books and was bored with the subject. Out of friendship I started reading and couldn't put it down until I was finished. Bloodtrail is the BEST vampire book I've ever read! Mr. Lewis has such a fantastic way of writing that I wasn't reading the book - I was living it. I eagerly look forward to more books from this exceptionally talented writer!
5,Need a trilogy for Bloodtrail,"David R Lewis must complete the Bloodtrail trilogy. We need to know the rest of this story. The plot is strong, the characters deep and the Nosferati frightful. The flow of this book is intricate and surprising with switchbacks that drew me into his lair. Lewis offers unique perspective on the Vampire theme. Lewis' work employs his exhaustive research to maximize impact. If Nosferati can be altrustic, Lewis makes it believable. This story kept me up three nights running. When the trilogy is done, it must become a movie!! Bought this book from Amazon for my IPad Kindle app...easy to do."
5,Very satisfied,"I have been using this recorder for approx 2 months and have not experienced any problems whatsoever. I'ts easy to hook up and easy to use.It is wired to my VHS and DVD player and of course my TV, I can now copy from all three sources, with outstanding clarity.Sure, it does not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive recorders but at this price it's gotta be hard to beat. The DVD RAM recording capability is a great asset."
2,Novice learns the hard way.,"Actually the recorder performs fairly well. The remote buttons can drive you crazy, however. The main difficulty in owning this unit has to do with the instruction booklet.The booklet shows diagrams for wiring it up. The flyer added shows a different method. Since neither of these instructions would work for me, I called for tech assistance. This was a several day endeavor. Getting through for help is a disaster. When I finally made it through, and I told the tech about the multiple instructions I heard her laugh. Actually she was very helpful. I used a different hook-up which works fine.Without having a friendly booklet, each step in learning has been grueling. Panasonic needs to think what it means to be User Friendly.Dave Rowan"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PANASONIC DVD,I bought this Panasonic DVD recorder DMR-ES10 because Amazon customers said the picture quality was good. Not so! Compared to the TV image direct from cable the image quality from this recorder is flat and grayish. faces show yelowish instead of pinkish without highlights. The manual is written by people who understand the machine but do not have a clue how to write for first time buyers.
4,Really great blender but...,"I bought this hand blender to make home-made baby food and protein shakes. It works extremely well IF you use the container that comes with it. When trying to use other containers, whether larger or smaller, pieces of food are missed, causing a mess and great inconvenience."
4,Wish I used it more!,"This product does what it claims to, and I've never had any mechanical problems with it. Be forewarned, however; for the most part, this machine will NOT work as a mixer and sometimes not in blending applications either. As a guy in his mid-20's, I figured it would do it all. No such luck, but it's great for its intended purposes!"
1,Cheap hand blender - burned out FAST,I bought this for my own kitchen after having a BRAUN for many years. It didn't last more than a few weeks. If I hadn't thrown all the packaging away I would have returned it. I was so mad I threw it into the wastebasket. It was a waste of money. It burned out blending eggs and milk. Go figure. I don't recommend it - there are many other hand blenders that will last a long time.
5,Excellent job guys,"This album is the greatest house album ever! Forget about Ibiza, Brazil and Portugal rules."
1,Tracks are not long enough,"The tracks are only 30 to 100 seconds long.Was a good trip down memory lane, however, if I were going to listen to while working out I would want it to last at least a half hour."
2,"Cute, but not practical","If you enjoy the old fashioned ""look"" and bringing back some memories of fairs and carnivals, this is for you. If you are looking for a practical cotton candy machine -- don't bother. It's not really kid friendly, so if you have them, beware. The element in the middle can get extremely hot and the sugar that spits out is very hot. Unfortunately, the amount of sugar that you can put in at a time is extremely small, so you'll yield a very small amount of cotton candy before you have to turn it off, refill, and turn back on.If you want something to help spend time with the family, this'll do the trick. If you want a better functioning machine, get something else."
4,Superb,"This piano book is a great sequel to the other books Alfred has published for the advanced (and adult) piano player and learner. The books contain very good learning tips and examples of music and the knowledge of notes. I highly recommend this series. also for the variety of music pieces from well-known, semi-pop and classical."
2,Received dirty life jacket,I received a life jacket that appeared to be worn or stored in a dirty facility. I contacted company and they did offer a discount or to ship it back free.
3,not as described,I purchased this item based on the description that my childrens ht and wt would fit. Not the case. Meant for children six and older. Coast Guard rated a three also not mentioned. Not appropriate for young children. Total waste of time and money. Better descriptives needed.
4,Reformed yet understandable,"This commentary is a fairly easy read. John Currid's excellent grasp of the original languages undergirds the exegeses, especially the more complex passages. His approach is Reformed, Covenantal, Six Days, and a historical approach to Noah's flood. This particular commentary is written in such a way that the average reader can get a lot out of it while having much valuable material for the more advanced student of Scripture.I found it a refreshing counter to the Wellhausen JEDP theory (and its great-grandchildren).If you are looking for a good commentary that is thoroughly biblical, complex and yet not overly so, this would be a good addition a Sunday School teacher's bookshelf."
2,"A Little Too Repetative, even for a 3 year old",The game is easy for a toddler to play however it became a little repetative after 10 minutes. The screen is the same in every sub-game and the characters remain the same throughout. I give this one a Rating of L for LAME!
3,Its ok,I got this game for my son and he learned a lot. At first he didnt like it but then he really got invovled in it . I gave it three stars because of the price.
2,Important note about carrier,"The carrier is very cute, and lightweight...however, if you have a frisky cat or dog that do not like to be in carriers do not purchase this one! There are three zippers: one on each side, and on on the top..however there is nothing to snap together where the two sides zip up to the top so it is very easy for my kitten to poke her head up between the clossures and eventually wiggle her way out! This way very scary since I was driving her to the vet alone in my car and had to hold both sides closed so she wouldn't jump out. I think the carrier is very cute, so I am going to figure out someway to snap the sides close."
5,puppy loves her bag,Love my new bag and so does my puppy. She can see out of the side and loves poking her head up and out on the top to look around and we walk. Very soft interior makes her not want to get out sometimes. lol I recommend this bag for up to 10-lbs small puppies :) we love it
1,"This ""PET carrier"" is misnamed","This should be called a DOG carrier - it is not intended for cats and I am trying to think what I will do with it now, since I bought it for my cats. It comes up when you search for CAT carrier - or I wouldn't have bought it. The zippered top doesn't close all the way around - and cat or kitten will get out of it quite quickly - IF you could get a full grown cat into it in the first place since it is rather small."
2,multiple sizes do NOT exist,"Bought a ""small"" for my wife and a ""large"" for myself. Both costumes have individual tags and packaging stating 'small' and 'large', but they are exactly the same size - Large. So if you order a small, you probably still need to get the sewing machine out."
1,Scratchy Beyond Belief,"I just received these sheets in the mail, and I can tell you there is NO WAY my baby's skin is getting anywhere near them. They feel like fiberglass. I read another review that said they were 100 % cotton, but they must have changed them or something, because the ones they sent me are the roughest, scratchiest example of polyester/cotton blend garbage the world has ever seen. I am truly appalled that these things are being marketed for babies. If I put my child on them for half an hour he would get an abrasion rash!These are going back. If I can't find anything better to fit the little snuggle nest mattress I will put it in a pillowcase. I highly recommend you do the same."
5,Works,Not much to review here. It's a fitted bedsheet for the snuggle nest mattress. Fits the mattress good and the baby doesn't really care about threadcount :-)So no complaints...
1,Can I give it 0 stars?,"OMG! Seriously? Over $200 for this thing? I wouldn't pay over $30. I purchased this thing in person, from a ""big box"" store. It was $110 and while it LOOKS good in the picture it is not sturdy AT ALL. I have a lot of experience putting furniture together being a regular IKEA shopper so I know I didn't do it wrong. The ""wood"" was flaking off in chunks before I even got it out of the box. The plastic ""trim"" around the edges of the wood was peeling off right out of the box. After putting it together and seeing how easy it is to tip over I may just throw it away even though it was over $100. Oh and the cute little ""privacy screen"" at the bottom? Well this desk must have been designed by a non-computer user because it makes it so you can't plug in any of your cables to the back of the machine! I hate it so much I looked everywhere online to find a place I could review it to warn others to please not purchase this desk."
4,"Duplicate book, new front cover","I bought this book, More Quick Rotary Cutter Quilts (For the Love of Quilting), as well as Big Book of Quick Rotary Cutter Quilts by Pam Bono. I was surprised and disappointed to see the same patterns in both books, just a new front and title. The only difference is the Big Book of Quick Rotary Cutter Quilts has more patterns and more pages. I won't be buying any more quilting books off the internet unless I can see a content page."
1,Reprint,"I am still upset so take my review in stride.I bought ""Big Book of Quick Rotary Cutter Quilts"" by Pam Bono, several years ago and loved the quilts and well written instructions. When I saw ""More Quick Rotary Quilts"" I was excited and ordered right away. It is the EXACT same quilts, from the first book, minus the BEST quilts. Even the cover quilt is featured in the first book."
1,Useless,"I haven't seen any improvement in my breast, they're just going to be forever small I guess. It's a very big disappointment, wasn't worth the price I payed. Would really like my money back."
1,Doesn't work,"No results and messed up my menstrual cycle bad. It is always irregular and long, but this time while taking it, it made it even heavier and last almost 3 weeks!"
1,Yuck!,"The only thing this product did was make me retain water. my breasts did start to get larger but it was all water weight and i almost grew out of my pants, on top of that it was the most disgusting tasting pills ever, and that's saying something since these were gel capsules and all you do is swallow. i would never recommend these to anyone."
3,Good,If male mixed with evegen at 8 pills a day great job. Just by itself not good. Two month supply gone an need to order more thank u.
1,Absolutly horrible!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My wife and I had to laugh at times over the poor quality of not only the English dubbing, but the dialog itself. the pierce Brosnon version is pretty bad, but this makes it seem like citizen kane in comparison. I went by the reviews.....boy, what were you thinking? If you want a descent Crusoe movie, I recommend Crusoe, with Aiden Quinn. It is not true to the book, and didn't win any awards, but it the best of the three mentioned in my review. as for this one, we didn't finish it and threw it out. hope this saves someone from buying it and being disapointed."
3,Dutch girl group/garage rock from the 1960s,"An archival set of Dutch girl group/garage rock from the 1960s... Rare stuff, although not musically on a par with some other Nederbeat sets out on the market in recent years. This isn't the disc to start with, but if sets like the ""Nederbeat"" box or the ""Biet Het"" compilations have gotten you all fired up, this could be a welcome compliment. Worth checking out. (DJ Joe Sixpack)"
1,What a Mess!,This book is poorly organized and completely confusing. There's no overview of the entire range and her trail maps have you moving all over the book to find a connection. (Warning) This map sent us down a trail that no longer existed which was our planned exit point. We had to reroute and end of up at the car at 1:00 in the morning!!
4,elegant idea book,"perhaps the book is mistitled. i can't believe anyone would actually buy this book thinking it had home depot how-to ""solutions,"" as some reviewers claim. what it is, is a beautiful, elegant, modern *idea* book. i saw it in the bookstore of a modern art museum and wrote down the title to come home and buy it online. it is a visual documentary of possibilities, powerful in its simplicity and convincing in its aesthetic. as a graphic designer, an architecture student, and a dabbler in interior design, i can say it's one of my favorites."
1,A real disappointment,"Is this what passes for book publishing now? I opened the book to find that someone threw together a mishmash of photos that I guess they happened to like and then wrote practically nothing about them. If i want pictures put together scrapbook fashion like this, I can clip photos from magazines and tape them into a blank book. Which is what this is."
4,Military Slant Surprisingly Interesting,"I grew up with some idea of what military life was like due to my Dad being in the Navy - but I must admit it's never held a lot of interest for me. Reading Kelly's book did actually shed a whole new light on what advantages military service can bring to other aspects of someone's life. The principles that are discussed in the book (Duty, Impeccability, Passion, Perseverance, Planning, Teamwork, Loyalty, Flexibility, Selfless Service and Integrity) are all really worthy reading for anyone in business and the military slant I found surprisingly gave it more bite and interest."
5,Perdew Delivers,"Perdew hits the mark in this fluid and inspirational work. Superb practical advice for any business leader with or without military experience. A must read for entrepreneurs, executives, and emerging leaders."
4,A very good book for the military or business leader,"This book by Apprentice winner Kelly Perdew is a worthwhile read. Written in the style of many military-business leadership books, it swtiches back and forth between Perdew's Apprentice exploits and anecdotes from great military veterans turned business leaders. The stories about Perdew's career, Apprentice tasks, and about others are both inspirational and entertaining. I am giving 4 stars because he talks about principles, but does not go deep into the reader's application of them.Nevertheless, this is a worthwhile read for both the Army or corporate officer."
5,Incredibly motivating and inspiring!,"As an Airborne Ranger, I was very interested to learn how Kelly had used his West Point and Military training to ultimately land a top job with Donald Trump. After reading this book, I have no further questions about how he won and he has done an amazing job of breaking life down into 10 easy to follow principles.This is a great tribute to what hard work and never giving up on your dreams can do for anyone! Kelly thanks for the inspiration."
5,USB Optical Mouse,What can you say about a USB Optical Mouse? I bought this to have on hand as a replacement. It's an inexpensive precaution that will save you lots of trouble should your existing mouse fail.
2,Unhappy,"This item is not nearly as universal as it would lead you to believe. I purchased it knowing that it was a fairly cheap system, but the stands are incapable of holding anything other than small speakers."
4,"Great temperature regulation, but cycles quickly for a fan unit.","This thermostat is great, it maintains temperatures much better than the old manual-style thermostat I had. The apartment is much more comfortable. I do wish the regulating range or cycle times were adjustable, because even when on ""Fan"" mode the unit cycles quickly, which could be hard on forced-air wall heaters as the fan cycles on and off more.Also, big disappointment... One week after I purchased the thermostat, I got an email from Amazon advertising that the price had gone down about 10%. Thanks..."
3,Impossible to program,"Every time I need to reprogram the Aube I need to call the manufacturer in Canada. The instruction manual is poorly written and difficult to use. It needs to be completely rewritten.This is the second Aube I've purchased. The first one failed to hold the settings. The only reason I bought another one was because of the technical specs.Also, when I got the second one it was set in Celsius, and I needed to call Canada to figure out how to change it to F."
2,Strange programming,"I was disappointed in this product because the programming is strange. You can only program it to three preset temperatures: Vacation (55), Away/Asleep (62?), and home (70). During the day, there are 4 set temperature periods - Away/Asleep, Home, Away/Asleep, Home, and all you can do is choose the times during which those 4 periods will occur. You can't specify the temp, and if you don't want a period, you just make it as short as possible (15 min). So if you like to sleep at 68 degrees, and have your house at 72, you can't use the programming - You'll have to just manually change the temps."
2,Thermometer is Off,"Not happy with this product. The digital readout for temperature is simply off. For instance, it'll read 67 when it's 72 in the room. Using this product does not give you control over the temperature; I simply have to put it one or two degrees over whatever temperature it says it is to turn it on and then I have to manually turn it off or check the actual temperature with another device. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it."
2,Did not work,I installed it easily but it did not work. I have two 240 volt 8' baseboard heaters and my only guess is that those exceeded the draw that this unit will support. My heaters say they are 2000 watts and this unit supposedly supports 4000-Watts so I am not sure why it did not work. It did not give any error message and indicated it was working but the heat did not come on. May try a higher wattage unit.

5,"a caring, compassionate book","This book by Ellen M. DuBois offers solace to women who have been through the painful experience of miscarriage. The pain is worse because it is experienced alone. Family and friends can't really appreciate how hard it is or understand its devastating aftereffects. With this book you're not alone. And besides the companionship provided, ways of coping with the grief and loss are given utilizing expert advice from Dr. Linda Backman, a specialist in grief and loss counseling and a woman who has also gone through miscarriage herself. Also, for the religious, a section on faith is provided.If you have gone through the experience of miscarriage within the past few years, you need this book now. If you know someone who has, give them this book as soon as possible."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"There is nothing outright terrible about this book.. It just was not what I was looking for.. I was hoping for a book of women who would share their stories, talk about their emotions, make me feel normal.. Instead, its more of an instruction guide on how to get through it.. I didn't get the book til I was 3+ months past my last miscarriage.. And, since it was my 2nd.. I feel like i already KNOW how to get through it.. I felt that the authors were sort of telling me what I should do, how i should feel.. where i was looking for people to tell me how THEY felt.."
2,Religious,"If you are religious this might be a good book for you. I am not religious at all and there are a lot of references to God that just didn't do it for me. There are also a lot of things that I think most of us already know in this book, like exercise will make you feel better and so will positive affirmations. And the chapters on those subjects seem to go on and on. This book just wasn't for me mainly because all of the God references."
1,Poorly written,I had difficulty getting through this book as it is poorly written. In the beginning it started out decent but as the author moved on she seemed to move far too fast through the grieving stages.
2,Really helped,"Really helped me see i wasn't alone. its a really good read for anyone in this situation, helps you heal."
1,Abused,"Abused by Book Crazy.Very difficult to obtain an answer. Book in very very poor condition, over description. Back (cover) teared (not mentionned). No dialog possible. When I complained, answered that we were not speaking about the same book !I 'll never make a confident order to those people.Irony and keep money are their song.Totally deceived, and nothing to reply, being in Europe across the ocean."
3,3 VCDs look similar,"it's fun to watch the 1st 2 VCDs as we can see many funny scenes, but it doesn't encourage me to see thh 3rd VCD since I believe they're all similar."
5,The Kids Like it a Lot!,"This television is in my daughter's room because she plays video games with her friends, and watch a lot of television shows, movies, etc. I really like that there is a stand below it- somewhere to store her game systems, bluray player, and a few other little gadgets that they hook up to the television themselves. They even have the computer connected to it at times, as well as their smart phones to play videos. She has had this television since she was 10 and is 15 now and has always easily connected the bluray player, or dvd player, or game console on her own without help from an adult. Apparently it's easy to use. the only problem I have with it is right now: a message pops up on the screen saying that the lamp needs to be replaced- so I have to find a new lamp. Otherwise, it's great."
3,HAD THE SAME PROBLEM with colored spots burnt into the screen,"PROBLEM with colored spots burnt into the screen,Panasonic PT-52LCX65. Still waiting for the customer service guys to approve an extension on my 5 year old warranty so that the eeprom can be reprogrammed by a serv tech at the house. Seems everyone has had this problem and the bulbs that are not panasonic factory bulbs are half as much money but they last only 18 months(ORIGINAL BULB LASTED 4 YRS.) and when they blow they literally explode into fragments of glass,possibly compromising other items. You must never turn it off by the surge protector, as a fan must run afterwards to cool the bulb, or else. Also i am told the 7O DOLLAR 'bulb ballast' will have to be replaced soon as they don't last forever either, although the tv has been very good as far as picture, it is becoming a hassle to get serviced, even though panasonic allegedly lost a suit and has to provide this extended warranty. It is therefore an avg rated tv."
4,Needs a bit more detail,"I would have appreciated this book more if it had more detail as to why a product is deemed halaal or haram...One of the products that it listed as Halaal actually had an ingredient that was haraam (alcohol based) when I examined the label at the market. Very good guidebook and and work of mercy, my gratitude to the authors for the education. But always read the labels!Shukran"
5,"Hey, MTV, play some real music!!!","It's so beyond me why radio and MTV play so much garbage when amazing rock and roll like UFB are out there. This album is almost as good if not as good as ""This will be laughing week."" Hard driving guitar and pounding drums are balanced by McShane's smooth pop, sometimes falsetto, singing. I've been to a bunch of shows and the crowd is mixed - girls love the lyrics and singing, guys love the hard rock sound, old, young - there is something for everyone. Best tracks are ""The scheme to listen no more"" ""When I'm with you, I'm ok"" and sorry, I can't remember the rest. Are you ready to rock? It's not a question baby..."
2,Open Up and Say Aw Shucks,"You can call it pop-punk, punk-pop, emo, or whatever you want, but ""Open Up and Say Awesome"" traffics in generic power pop, circa 2002. All fuzzy guitar riffs and straining teen boy vocals, there's nothing here that a thousand other bands don't do just as well. In the Fakebook's defense, however, I should add that there are fifty times more who don't do it even this good."
2,Animals killing other animals,"If you want a book about predatory animals with bad rhymes, then you've come to the right place. The pictures are fine and the pop-ups are as expected. For example,I is for IBEXES,real down and uppers,J is for JACKALS,who steal tiger's suppers."
3,Need an interpreter as well as the caffeine,"I gave this book three stars because I have no doubt it covers the material it is supposed to. Other than that, I have to say that I fully agree with the reviewer who said you needed plenty of caffeine to slough through it. ""Pretentiously-written"" is an understatement. The authors write as if they just love to hear themselves talk, not to actually convey information. Saying that this is a ""college"" textbook does not excuse its wordiness, needlessly over-complicated phrasing, and long-windedness. I am a college-educated person, and, like the previous reviewer, had to read and re-read each section to get the kernel of meaning out of it. I started looking through the book because my daughter is using it for her AP European History class and was getting bogged down with it. Perhaps it gets better in later chapters (I went through the Black Plague and Renaissance chapters)."
2,AP Euro book,We HAD to buy this for a AP Euro class. I would not recommend it. Some of the information is very hard to sift through and understand. The authors are all ivy league educated and took some interesting material and bored us all. There has got to be other textbooks out there that bring history to life.
2,terrible!,"This textbook is boring, pretentiously written, and does not present the information in a concise, understandable way. I am currently using it for an AP European History class, and after a year of using Bailey's ""The American Pageant"" for AP US, the difference is so blatant. The American Pageant breaks down time periods concisely into clear paragraphs and you don't fall asleep reading it. Often with this text, I find myself having to read the same page 10 times to actually comprehend it, it's that dull. I passed the AP US exam, but I'm not so sure about the AP Euro (due in part to the teacher, and in part to this inferior text.)"
1,Condition of book was overstated,"The book was represented as in good condition. However, it was heavily underlined in pen, hi-lighted and numerous notes written in the margin. The book was bought as a replacement for a high school advanced placement course. Not only have we spent $60+ for the book, a stiff penalty will be assessed at the end of the semester due to the poor condition of the text. At best it was less than fair condition. I will be very hesitant to purchase another used book on line. I have photographed the condition of the item. How do I get those images to Amazon."
4,"Bit convoluted, but still useful","Although the text tends to skip around in regards to dates (one paragraph is on the 1300s, then the next section is back to the 1200s) it is overall a good tool for the European history scholar."
2,Wrong item,I looked thru lots of different ads for the old style quage with the metal mounting bracket like this one is described. I received the new style with the molded plastic mounting ears that break off after a few months of growing brittle in the sun.
3,Childs Watch,"The materials of this watch are not durable, the battery will discharge quickly, or the seller or the discharge was of poor quality"
1,Bleed this turnip dry.,"Nathaniel Philbrick wrote an exceptional book titled, ""In the Heart of the Sea - The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex"". Is is full of vivid accounts of the plight of the whaleship Essex - from its departure from the wharves of Nantucket to its eventual ramming and sinking by an irate sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific to the rescue of a few lucky souls 94 days later. It won a National Book Award for the author and deservedly so.Now we are to read ""Revenge of the Whale"" by the same author. Well, this is only a poorly abridged version of ""In the Heart of the Sea"". It has all the facts with none of the details and side stories of the original. Why this book exists is beyond me. I know! Lets delete a few pages - Phil can decide what to take out - and re-release this baby under a new title and make some more money!Advice - take a little more time and purchase the original - forget that you ever saw this title."
3,Interesting...,"Revenge of the Whale is a somewhat gory book. The prelude really gets you interested, but when the stroy starts, it's pretty boring; all about the island of Nantucket and how sailing and whaling is their life...lalala. Once they hit the water, the story starts to get a little interesting, though. A whale rams the Essex ship and all twenty men get onto the smaller whaleboats floating out in the middle of the ocean. The captain is a very pressured man and never goes withwhat he thinks. Everyone can change his mind if there's majority. This course eventually leads to seperation of the crew, thirst, hunger, and cannibalism... It's up to you if you want to read it. Moby Dick was based on the story of the Essex so if you liked MOby Dick, you might like this."
2,This Book is Quite Boring,"I am having to read this book for school and I do not like it at all. It has no main charactersin it and the story plot is boring. I would not recommend this book for kids because it is interesting to read. Maybe some adults or very few kids would enjoy this book if they are really into whale hunting. Other wise, do not read it."
3,A disappointing Moby single,"To tell the truth, I was not impressed by this CD single. I absolutely love the track, however the remixes did not live up to the original in any way. The downtempo mix is not a bad mix at all, but doesn't change the original track so much. the other mixes are not at all original or fresh at all. they do not add a great vibe to the song at all. it does provide for an interesting listen, but it's not worth buying."
4,Fun To A Point,"its a cute , cuddly little game to playnot too hard , will keep you occupied but only to a pointworth buying"
3,Overall Unenjoyable,"Many people have given Castlevania III Dracula's Curse high praise. Personally I do not praise this game very much. The game has great graphics and music for the NES. There is a also password system in it that is very useful. It's also very innovative and Konami definitely delivered in that department. However, there are some serious flaws with this game that make it unfun to play. The game control is very choppy and stiff. For a platformer the level design is terrible and nearly unpassable at certain points. This is not challenging; It's irritating and stupid. This not an NES game I would lump in with classics like Mega Man 2 or Super Mario Bros. 3 (Those are fun and enjoyable). If you enjoy spending countless hours trying to fruitless complete a level, go ahead and get Castlevania III. I, however, like to have fun playing a video game and having great graphics and music just doesn't cut it. Not a terrible NES game, but not a great NES game either."
5,CASTLEVANIA III: DRACULA'S CURSE game review,"""Trevor Belmont is the great-grandfather of Simon Belmont. It is the year 1476, and Dracula has waged a war against humanity due to the death of his wife Lisa, who was burned at the stake after being accused of witchcraft. The people of Warakiya have called upon Trevor to save them from the wrath of Count Dracula."" - The manualHow sad is that? I now pity for the prince of darkness because I have to whip his sorry butt for good until Super Castlevania IV for the SNES comes out. I love this game. You get to be, along with T-Bel, Dracula's son, Alucard(That's Dracula spelled backwards), this dead girl, Syphia Belnades, whose family was slain for being witches and was then called up to rid Europe of Dracula, Grant DaNasty, a former pirate and another person whose family was killed by Dracula. I think Dracula's going to get it. :)"
5,greatest nes game ever!!!,"i've been playin this game since 1992, and let me say this, it is the best nes game i've ever played. you play through the game as trevor belmont, and can be one of 3 spirt warriors. grant, sypha,or alucard. to desricbe this game in one word it'sGREAT!!!!!!"
5,gorgeous,"Gorgeous and fun. I bought one for atop the bunk beds, which has worked fine for my daughter. Getting two might be fun too for each bed when separated if you want to add more gifts down the road (too pricey to get all at once)."
4,Not a bad qualitative discussion on radar cross section,"This book discusses, at an introductory level, the concepts of radar cross section and electromagnetic scattering phenomena. It also goes over some of the computational techniques used in the area of RCS prediction, such as physical optics, diffraction, and the method of moments. There are also several sections that talk about radar absorbing materials (RAM) and RCS reduction. Most of the equations in this book are, however, useless as far as implementation in a production-level numerical code. To do so, the reader will need to go back to the original sources (which the authors do reference) and go from there."
2,too boring,This video did not keep me motivated. It is very boring and hard to follow. I would not recommend it. I would however recommend the Crunch series boot camp. It really helped me get fit.
2,Good. But not great.,"I've never enjoyed the first two sections of this video: they use too much living-room space, and demand perfect balance. Only the leg work at the end is good (about 12 minutes). I love the instructor however, she is a trip and it's amazing that even on video she could convey so much energy! And she does have killer legs."
4,Streamline your legs,"This video will definitely help tone up your legs, but since it's only a 30 minute video you can't expect to see results anytime soon. It's a good starting point for beginners and a good way to learn what type of moves will tone your legs. I've had this video for about 3 years, and don't use it often, but when I do I'm always surprised by the level of exertion you can get from only 30 minutes of toning. I'd recommend this video as a stepping stone for someone just beginning to get in shape, and as a change in routine for advanced exercisers."
4,"Great! Keeps me movitated, you feel sexy!","This is a very great tape for legs, although I hv not achieved the results I wanted yet, I feel that I hv worked out every part of my muscles every time. The tape is fast paced (35mins but there isn't too much talking beforehand or afterwards), it's fun and the instructor is really encouraging and keeps you movitated throughout the workout. She knows exactly when to drops the right comments at the right time, especially when you are about to slack off, she will say ""You can do it"" or ""Think of the legs you've always wanted"", then I will really stick with it for another 5 minutes as I feel as though I am gonna get those sexy legs soon.The only thing I dislike(but still ok i guess)is the cool down part, when you think ""wow, i am finally done"" u still hv some more to do other than just stretching out at the end. But overall, this tape really worths the money!"
3,Just OK,"I bought this to add to other workouts I do. I actually prefer my step aerobics and turbo jam (both are more intense and better at getting me to sweat), but this is OK to do occasionally for variety"
5,Excellent!,"I highly recommended this DVD from the National Gallery of Art. I'm not sure, but I suspect it was made to accompany the recent exhibition touring the country. The DVD packs a great deal of information and insight (and many visuals of Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings and lithographs) into a fairly short film. But don't let its 25-minute length deter you from buying it. It's better than many longer films about the life and work of artists."
2,sloppy and half hearted effort,Some commentaries are mumbled and others poorly pronounced. Perfunctory explanations of technique make no effort to be clear and understandable. Some images are in incorrect format. The production did not aim to create a product of quality; created by functionaries going through the motions.
5,brilliant,A brilliant depiction of a brilliant artist. Excellent commentary by a few art historians and delightful period music. A lot of information and enjoyment concentrated in a short video.
1,Never recv'd,I ordered this item and it was returned as undeliverable - at least twice.So I really can't comment other than that - the delivery system is not very good.
2,"too fast pace, unsufficient details","This book does not offer you the info to start with Mambo/Joomla without help. It simply lacks the depth for it. I bought the book, and followed the examples, that's all i can do now. The examples are simple, but for a joomla starter hardley explained. Wat cracks me is that there's not any explanatio about the structure of Joomla, the relations between objects and their calls."
1,A total rip-off,This book(sorry its just a few pages out of a paper copier) bound spirally. Its a total rip-off for the price I have paid. The authenticity of the book should be checked and its reviewers because it has been downright misleading. I feel so pained and totally cheated that a good site like this should house such items and that too without any indication of its low quality and content.This is the second time I have been cheated paying such high prices for the books when they wouldn't even be worth $3.00 a piece.It seems to be a trend to pose some paper copied notes as a book by some trash selling 'publisher' and very misleading to an unwary buyer. Its out of faith in the Amazon site that I bought this book.
4,"totally not hiphop,very busy but also very ambient,ok i said it","i must agree with the first review, this isn't hiphop. and for me thats just fine.don't get me wrong, i love my daedelus,dabrye,and the very talented scott herren,but only when it's more sound, beat collage no rap-n-rymn guest vocals.not that i even consider this close to those artists. like i said,i have too agree with the first review, this is different and dead on about the vocal useage and close on the lo fi minimal flow but i really don't like to compare or pigeonhole a new artist or project because just like anything new with experimental process be it music,art,writing etc. just because i do all the above and really have no desire for vocals in song verse unless it's like this or sampled to flow with the beat.so again i think the first review pretty well sumed it up,very good ear.i know,this is what i do."
3,Burner just smolders,"I am not condoning drug use by any means, but the way you consume this album will greatly change your opinion of it. Nosdam's fourth solo album is also his most coherent and streamlined. The samples he selects are used to embellish his own productions rather than create new songs and they are as varied as ""Donkey Kong"" to ""Titticut Follies"" to ""Night of the living dead."" The entire album seems to build up to the Patton collaboration ""11th Ave Freakout Pt 2"" which oozes and bubbles along wonderfully then crawls back down to nonsense production like ""upsetter"". The album does work, but it's nowhere near as interesting or wild as ""No more Wig for Ohio"" or ""Plan 9"" or even the beat's he's made for Peeping Tom or Sage Francis. The album as a whole is forgettable but don't you dare sleep on tracks like ""Untitled Pt. 1, 11th Ave Freakout Pt.2, or Flying Saucer Attack."""
3,3.5 Stars - Expecting more...,"Somewhat disappointing (debut?? no...) album from Nosdam, who in my opinion, did a better job with No More Wig For Ohio and his very creative Le Mix Tape Deluxe albums. Not a failure, but Burner is very much a disjointed album nonetheless."
5,"Swords of the British Army, by Brian Robson","An outstanding book for the serious scholar or collector, with a good number of photos and descriptions of every issue sword type. The text follows the history of design, selection, testing, issuance, and politics of the sword in the British army. Possibly too detailed for the person with just a casual interest. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in this field."
5,Great book,"There are books that make one feel alive, actually reborn and this great book is such a powerful book. I am sure that it will be remembered as a masterpiece in depicting pain, longing and loss. Even if I had not met the author personally at college (great job, Adam, keep up the good work), I would have considered it one of the most beautiful literary surprises of the last year."
3,"interesting, but...","I don't understand the rave reviews for this book. ""The herald of a phenomenal career""? Some of the stories were moving and worked well, but I don't think he's god. And often they read like short fiction versions of Diane Arbus photos -- if you simply take a picture of something that is guaranteed to move your audience on its own, it might be worth viewing, but is it talent? I just felt like the stories relied too much on easy visceral reactions (skin diseases, fingers chopped off, manic behavior) for their impact. Often there's little else there to flesh out a story -- interesting but undeveloped concepts, though once or twice he makes a solid hit. Read the first few; pass on the rest."
5,Great literary work,"First off, the syntax displayed throughout the book is both intreaging and eloquent. Each plot can huant you for days, and I love the way that each story is so wonderfully differnt, specific, fresh, original, and imaginative. Although the book is a little dark in a way, I would highly reccomend it to anyone that wants to read a good novel. Frankly, I can't wait for the release of Hasslett's next peice of work."
4,Loneliness on Every Page,"I read ""Union Atlantic"" before buying this collection. I was really impressed in that book by Haslett's ability to put numerous characters onto a page and somehow find a way to connect them all in meaningful ways. After finishing the novel, I wanted more so I turned to this earlier work.Again, I was struck by Haslett's ability to render individuals across disparate backgrounds and make them feel real. In this collection, he creates many interesting people working through many different issues in a way that makes their loneliness -- or their struggle -- a reader's loneliness. I particularly enjoyed ""Notes to My Biographer,"" ""The Beginnings of Grief,"" and ""The Volunteer."" The last of those is the best, in my opinion, but each story is beautiful.There is a lot wrong with the state of American letters, often writers go for the cute or the intellectual. Haslett, however, goes for raw emotion and he gives me hope that this current generation of writers will keep us moving forward."
3,When it's good it's very good,"But it's also uneven. The first three stories and the last story are so memorable, but what happens between can feel a bit clunky and sentimental. But: ""Notes"" and ""Beginnings of Grief"" and ""The Volunteer"" are so very, very nice that what happens between may not matter at all."
3,SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS,"While I enjoyed the first few stories in this book, I found it eventually entered the land of cliche. What started off as fresh and intriguing eventually peetered out into a land of pretentious (and dare I say boring) mumbo jumbo. Not a waste of time, but the only place this book goes is down after the first few stories. Disappointing -- way too precious and polite at times. Dark, disturbing, and dysfunctional stories do not always equal good writing, at least not to this reader."
3,Beautifully written downer,"I bought this book at the dollar store for, you guessed it, a dollar. Somewhere in me is this naive optimist who believes in the hidden gem theory. I'm not saying that I didn't find a gem, I'm just saying I wish I hadn't. These stories are well-written, clever, forthright and SO DEPRESSING! I'm all for exposing the reality of characters, I don't insist on happy endings or tidy plots, but I do like a bone thrown my way occasionally, just so I don't find my frown staying right side up for the duration. Seems to me Mr. Haslett was let down by his editor, who should have solicited some lighter stories to bring the book into balance."
2,"Sorry, but these stories that are not ready yet.",The ideas for these stories are very good. Nevertheless I feel that they are not ready for publication yet and could also use a good copy editor.
1,Graphic overkill,"Though the publicity on the Today Show gave the indication that this book is targeted to a mass audience, the inclusion of some extremely vile subject matter, in my opinion, makes it only suitable for mature readers prepared for graphic overkill. I'm not easily offended and read a wide variety of fiction, however I felt mislead by this book."
1,An odd choice for Today Show's book club,"This author is a very talented writer whose sometimes offensive and disturbing subject matter makes you wish he weren't so skilled. Yes, these characters and stories stay with you long after the book is finished, but that's that not necessarily a good thing, particularly his story about an abusive homosexual relationship between teenage boys. There are literary merits to this collection--fascinating characters, unique and memorable stories and a exciting, creative style, however those are all overshadowed by the graphic and disturbing nature of at least one of his stories. That's something I never expected to find in a new writer's first collection of short stories (The publicity and dust jacket give no indication of it.) or in a book promoted by a national morning television show. (That's an even bigger surprise. I'm mystified by it.)"
3,"Nice sound, but not loud","I bought this amp after doing research on the lower end of the acoustic amps. I decided on this one, in part because of the reviews here. However, while the amp sounds nice and true - it is not overly loud. I have to keep it on 8 out of 10 to hear it decently in my living room. Not 1.5 as the other reviewer said. At 1.5, I can only hear my guitar not the amp. At 8, I can hear the amp over my guitar. Too annoying to return, so I guess I'm stuck with it. It's not a terrible practice amp, but don't think you can bring it to a gig."
3,"I'm the artist, and this album is not explicit","I laughed when I saw the [Explicit] tag on my album here. Almost all the music is instrumental, with no words at all, and what few they are don't include any foul language that I noticed during the recording, mixing, or mastering process. But hey, maybe there's something evil in there when you play it backwards, and maybe it will sell more copies!I've given it a 3-star review so I don't skew things either way. I am a tad biased, you know."
5,Good buy,"I all ready have two just like it.With this third one,I can record a lot more shows to watch later."
2,Fine product if not for shaky shelf life,"The DMR-ES10 has proven faithful to Panasonic's modern day tradition of decent-performing products that self-destruct right after the warranty period ends. Yes, it plays and records DVDs just fine, and despite the cryptic on-screen menus, it's pleasant to use, thanks in large part to a well-designed remote control. But once your two years are up, watch out. At that point, my unit started either producing unwatchable recordings (where the video plays back in intermittent freeze-frames spaced 1-2 seconds apart) or flat-out didn't record at all -- and over time, the failures have come to outnumber the successes. Now, even the simple act of turning it on sometimes provokes a disturbing chorus of buzzing, choking, and whirring noises.I've experienced similar failures in a Panasonic TV, VCR, DVD player, cordless phone, and car stereo in the past six years alone. If Panasonic's reputation for quality reflected reality, it would have been out of business years ago."
1,Overtime this unit will overheat and malfunction,I owned the model in black but their internals are the same. The unit was good for about 1 year when it started to freeze during recording and playback. It became progressely worse over the next month. I attribute it to excess heat. This model is NOT an Energy Star equipment. I replaced it with another Panasonic model DVD-S53 which does not have the recording feature but is Energy Star compliant and it works great. I think Panasonic tried to get this product to market too fast. I would not recommend buy this product at all. Go for an Energy Star compliant Panasonic product.
1,Mine Died Twice!,"Like almost everyone else, my unit froze dead when it was a few months out of warranty. Unlike most, however, I invested another $75 to bring it back to life after being told that the power problems were a ubiquitous design flaw. What I didn't know was that this sweet piece of garbage apparently has not one, but two, such flaws -- after another year it has begun (as others have reported) to make horrible grinding noises when trying to access discs is has just recorded successfully on, which it then claims are bad. To say that this is the worst piece of consumer electronics I've ever purchased is a massive understatement. We'll see if Panasonic refunds either the $75, the original purchase price, or both . . ."
2,great while it worked - broke after 13 months,"Really liked it. Would have rated it 4-star.But last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turnon anymore. Only the clock works.Just one month out of warranty.From other reviews, this seems to be a common problem."
2,Worked while it worked.,"I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago. I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all. I had it for 15 months."
2,broke after 1+ year,"Overall the recorder worked OK. A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons.However, that is irrelevant now. A few weeks ago, the unit stop working. I does not turn on at all. What a waist! It is out of warranty now."
1,A real Troubled Lemon! Stay Away!,"I purchased this unit about 18 months ago. After the warranty ran out, the unit first quit working with -R media. Then there is an issue with finalizing the DVD, which makes the dvd unusable. Unfortunately, this is after you record your show. Then all is lost. It started making squawking noises like something is very wrong. It never remembered the language or channels. Panasonic never did anything about this. After reading others with these same issues, I would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer!"
1,Wonderful unit until it died shortly out of warranty,"For a moderately priced DVD recorder it had great features and worked well. That is until it stopped working about 15 months after I purchased it. It has started to ""hang"", not responding to commands from the remote nor the front panel buttons. A power cycle is needed to restore it to a functioning state and based on other reviews I expect in a short time even that will not work. Knowing something about how these units work internally it's pattern of slowly degrading robustness is unanticipated.While I was quite happy with the unit and would have given it 4 stars for value, I truly expect a consumer device to last longer than 15 months, what used to seem like great value now looks like very poor value. At this point I would be loathe to purchase another Panasonic DVD recorder despite their initial high marks for features at a low price point. What good is it if it won't last?"
4,Interesting,An interesting and informative about a great leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Elder Pratt was a leader in the early days of the Church and spent much of his life doing missionary work. I enjoyed reading the book.
5,ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BOOKS ON LDS CHURCH HISTORY,"This is a first-hand account of the growth and history of the Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-day Saints, as seen through the eyes of one of its highest-ranking insiders (and Apostle), Parley P. Pratt.Pratt, a traveling preacher, first heard of the Book of Mormon in late August, 1830, and was baptized on about Sept 1, 1830. From then on, his life was one of total committment and devotion to God's work on Earth.Pratt served several missions for the Church and also suffered through many persecutions with the Prophet Joseph Smith himself, including several months in a filthy jail cell in 1838-1839. These experiences are told in fair detail so that it is easy for me to visualize them as if I had lived through them myself.If you want to know what life was really like for early LDS Church members and leaders, you need to read this book.--George Stancliffe"
3,Check out these other soundtracks,"I'm a huge MK fan, but I was a little disappointed with this one. For a couple of fantastic MK soundtracks with a Celtic lilt, check out ""Local Hero"" and ""Cal"". Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad soundtrack, but I didn't feel like it was as good as MK's other work."
1,Extremely unhappy with this product,"The plastic french cleat that came with this item did not hold the shelf on the wall. It fell off when placed on the french cleat. Luckily, I have a handy husband who will have to go out and buy wood and build his own french cleat in order to attach the shelf to the wall. This item should not be supplied with a flimsy piece of plastic as the french cleat. This makes it cheap and is not worth the $40. All said and done, my husband will have spent an additional $8 plus over an hour of his time in order to install this product. I do not recommend this product to anyone and am very disappointed. If I did not have my husband, I would be returning this product."
1,Pass on this WarGame,"I've played a lot of WarGames from WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Gulf War, but this by & large is the worst outta any war game. This game just pitful, the load times are a joke. It takes forever to just to load one mission & if you die in that mission, guess what? It takes even longer to reload the mission again, unlike other games where as when the level starts and if you die it'll just automatically re-load in seconds, like Shellshock Nam '67 for instince, not this game. VietCong Purple Haze, yea I can tell the developers of this game were a Purple Haze when they were making this game listening to Hendrix on the sound system smokin' a bong. If you all want to try this game, be my guest, but you'll agree when you're done playing how big of a waste it was of your time & money. I'm grateful I only rented it, and if you got half a brain you won't even think about owning this game. Avoid, seriously avoid VietCong: Purple Haze."
1,Buy Shellshock instead,"I have always been a huge fan of Vietnam War movies and an even bigger fan of war-themed video games. So I was pretty pumped when I saw that there was going to be a first person shooter for my PS2 called ""Vietcong."" Unfortunately I was pretty dissappointed when I played it. To put it simply, this was one of the worst games EVER. The graphics look like a PSOne game, and the sound is worse than an old Sega Genesis game. I don't have a good PC, so I have never been up to date on PC games, but I get the feeling that Vietcong was simply ported to the PS2 from a five year old PC game. This game was an absolute waste of money. If you are looking for a quality Vietnam War game, don't buy this one. I highly recommend ""Shellshock: 'Nam '67,"" it was amazing."
3,Sabotaged Debut,"Reviewers who are also writers want to find the good in the books they criticize because they will be on the other side some day. Ms. Cox's story was well thought out, and the format of diary entries interesting. Raven O'Connor was a very sympathetic character, and that's what kept me reading. However, whoever did the final editing at her publisher should be shot. It was very distracting to find so many glaring errors in the manuscript. Spellcheck can only do so much! We can only hope that Ms. Cox will find a better editor to help her with her next book."
1,measuring marks flaking off,"We have had these only a short time, & the red paint of the measuring marks is flaking off already. And this is with normal dish-washing in the sink, as opposed to using a dishwasher. (Don't know if a dishwasher would make it better or worse.) At this rate, these will soon be plain glass jiggers -- which is not what I needed."
1,Broken manual rearm pin,"The kit came with the correct CO2 cartridge, but the pin to reset the manual trigger was broken. So the kit was useless. A waste of money."
1,Wrong kit,"This is tricky. I shopped the various rearming kits for my Sospenders inflatable lifejacket, and ended up ordering two of these. They turned out to be the wrong size, and as I re-examine the details on the website I think the mistake was mine. Be sure to pay attention to the diameter of the threaded tip of the CO2 cartridge. Unfortunately, not returnable."
2,gross,was definitely looking forward to getting this and ended up being disappointed! i ordered this because i was trying to find the exact saf-t pops i had when i was a kid but it tasted weird.
4,I like OLAY touch of radiance,OLAY touch of radiance works for me. It gives me some color. Helps moisturize. And the main reason I bought this product was because it did not smell like perfume. I like the lavender scent. I would recommend this product.
5,Promax is the Best tasting Protein Bar,"Promax is the BEST tasting Protein Bar as I have tired many. But everyone's different so please don't take my word.My favorite is this ""Nutty Butter Crisp"" the Cookies and Cream is also very tasty.BASICS-Calories: 300Calories from Fat: 70Cholesterol: 0mgSugar: 26gProtein: 20gCarbs: 38g"
4,Review of Loeb's Plato VII,"The standard Loeb affair. What more might I say? The translation is adequate, notes are minimal and generally refer to variations in the Greek. The introductions are helpful, although incredibly short."
3,Lost some of its original humour,Much as I've enjoyed 'Allo 'Allo in the past I regretfully must admit that the last series following the end of WWII is lacking in something from the earlier series. However it has its moments and doesn't detract from the series as a whole. Perhaps the series went on a little too long and tended to appear somewhat stale towards the end.Try the earlier series
2,Here comes the cheese!,"Don johnson, like many major stars, begins stepping over the line of good judgement or good taste by taking this peculiar stroll out of the safe confines of acting.Like a long list of others before him (Eddie Murphy, William Shatner, Jim Carrey )Don Johnson seems to have come down with a show business virus known as the 'singing bug'. Mercifully, this is usually short lived, and the actor recovers somewhat wiser.Johnson, to his credit does at least possess something his peers usually don't, and that is his mediocre singing voice, which is at least somewhat forgivable.The other thing he posesses is acting ability, and he puts it to great use in this video as he tries somewhat dramatically to act like a pop/rock singer.Obviously Miami Vice inspired. The song itself inspires sleep."
5,Now I can die,"Why God, Why did you take, nay pluck Don Johnson away from us at the pinnacle of his singing career?!"
1,...,"Patterson is one of the few authors around that can make the entire story interesting, not because you want to find out how it ends, but because you want to find out more about the characters. Each page brings you more into the lives of the characters. This book is no different. It has murders and sex and lawyers and secrets from the past.I enjoy Patterson's flashbacks into a character's past that usually in some indirect way have a bearing on the outcome of the story.But I have on problem with this book. THIS BOOK IS CALLED THE FINAL JUDGEMENT, NOT CAROLINE MASTERS. THIS IS NOT A NEW BOOK. IF YOU ARE A PATTERSON FAN, YOU PROBABLY READ THIS BOOK A FEW YEARS AGO. IT CAME OUT IN HARDCOVER AND PAPERBACK UNDER A DIFFERENT TITLE. WHY MUST PATTERSON RESORT TO TRICKERY AND A HORRIBLE NEW TITLE IN ORDER TO ENTICE PEOPLE TO BUY A BOOK THEY ALREADY READ. I CAN GUESS WHY. CAROLINE MASTERS WAS IN PROTECT AND DEFEND AND HE WANTED FANS OF THAT BOOK TO READ THE FINAL JUDGEMENT..."
3,Same Story- Different Title,Don't be fooled! I thought that the plot of this book sounded familiar. It is! It is just a new title for The Final Judgement written by Richard North Patterson several years ago. I did enjoy The Final Judgement and the family relationship development. I'm wondering why the title was changed.
3,Hate This,I have wasted so much money purchasing books that have simply been re-named or re-published in a different cover... usually at an airport so I can't return it.I hate when they do this.
2,not so good,Richard North Patterson is usually a very good storyteller. But my biggest problem is I knew who the killer was about a quarter of the way into the story. It was all there for you. The only suspense left was would Caroline Masters have her new job waiting for her after the trial.I expected much more.
3,"Not bad, but not Palin's best","Hemingway Adventure: Quite different from the other Palin series I've seen (80 Days, Full Circle, Himalaya). Less of the point-to-point urgency in this one, and as a result it's more relaxed; and he goofs around more. There's some pretty funny stuff here. I just got through reading Hemingway's ""Sun Also Rises"" so it was good timing and interesting to see some of the sights and so forth. Overall pretty good, but some parts I found rather dull. Much prefer Full Circle and some of the others.Great Railway Journeys: Mostly this is for train fiends. I watched a bit of it but then bailed."
5,Another in a dynamite collection.................,There are some 40 discs in this series and they are all superb HYPERION recordings of works rarely performed or recorded....Highly recommended
2,Would be great (If it worked).,"The NES controller is a pretty great one. The one I ordered looked alright when I got it; it may have had a little yellowing, but it looked decent. However, once I hooked it up, the only button that did anything was ""A"". Not only that, when pressed, the button would do almost every function of the controller EXCEPT ""A"" (It would act like I was pressing Start, Select, B, Down, and Left all at once). I'm not sure if the controller is simply showing its age, or if this is one of the ""refurbished"" controllers (controllers that had their buttons/insides replaced with cheaper alternatives) that another reviewer said something about."
3,Beware when you buy some of these floating around here,"While they'll tell you they're the originals and un-altered, they're really not. While ""some"" of the parts are original, the buttons and internal guts are changed. This controller has easily been gutted and replaced with cheaper buttons, not found on the original NES controllers from my days of gaming. It works, don't get me wrong. It'll do in a pinch, but these certainly don't carry the Nintendo Seal of Approval on them... Well, the case might, but don't be fooled."
4,Good Deal,"This isn't an original controller for nintendo, it is a 2nd rate version, but it still works nontheless. I am happy with it, becuase I just wanted a 2nd working controler. If you're not looking for original, this is a good deal."
2,OK but badly written,"VERY exhaustive book on Dracula--the book, stage plays, movies etc etc. This gets into virtually every single incarnation of Dracula. There's nothing wrong with that but I couldn't get into Skal's writing. It comes across as very labored and (frankly) quite dull. The information on the book and movies are quite interesting but the ridiculously detailed decriptions of the plays and their productions go on forever. There's a huge amount of people involved in those chapters and I kept losing track of who was who. And, again, I just couldn't get into Skal's writing style. It kept throwing me out of the book and got wearisome. It's a worthy subject but badly written."
5,Dracula: Film and Stage,"Hollywood Gothic is strictly an historical account of Dracula and related characters in film and stage. It is well researched and pleasant to read. I was surprised with the story about Bram Stoker's wife Florence and her never ending legal battles to maintain control of the stage and film portrayal of Dracula in Europe and U.S. She apparently owned the rights to anything Dracula and made a fair living from licensing the rights on many occasions. I have known about the book Hollywood Gothic for several years but I never purchased it because the title wasn't very appealing or as I now know, somewhat misleading. However, once I read it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book is a must for any Dracula enthusiast."
3,Islam history,"PUBLISHER: Robert Hale Ltd; 1961 First Edition; H/B with D/W;SIZE: 9-1/2 x 6-1/2 inches appx. 288pp which includes 2 pages of Glossary, w/4 pages of chronological table, w/6 pages of selective bibliography.

5,Excellent resource for parents of young children,"I wish I'd had this book when when my daughter was born - I would have been a better and more confident parent. Penelope Leach writes a straightforward, easy-to-understand book that no parent should be without. She helps us understand why the child does the things he does, and once we understand why he's doing it, it's much easier to handle. Whether you're coping with a baby who won't eat or a toddler who throws tantrums, Leach gives you simple, easy solutions to try. Hers is a kinder, gentler form of parenting, in which we try to understand the child rather than simply trying to force him into some mold. I recommend this book highly."
2,A Bit Too Opinionated,"Based on positive reviews, my husband and I purchased this book as a reference for our newborn baby. Granted we didn't get very far with this book b/c we found the author to be a bit too opinionated. For example, she is so against circumcision that she ended up making my husband feel guilty for choosing to circumcise our son. We would have preferred a book that presented both the pro and con of the procedure and allowed us make up our own mind instead of making us feel bad for our choice."
2,Save your money!!,"Almost every topic in this book is over examined and overwritten. On the other hand, because she does delve into so many topics, you'll probably find something on everything (which is the only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of one). The author's tone comes off as ""talking down to"" parents. She has no medical or scientific background (i.e. RN or MD) and the book is fairly old for looking for up to date med./scientific information.Save your money. Look for a book that is more current and ideally written by someone who has a scientific background. Or better yet develop a caring & trusting relationship with your health care providers. They'll give you great, accurate, CURRENT information and if they are parents will share pointers too."
2,Don't waste your money!,Penelope Leach is so condescending! This book is NOT helpful and rather seems determined to make parents feel guilty for not treating babies according to her regimen. Lavish love on your baby and feel great about it! Don't waste your money on this book which will tell you otherwise.
5,Love Penelope,"I admit I don't own this book; however, I used to watch the show she had on tv witht he same name. I remember she suggested if you have to go into your child's room at night, to keep the lights off and just pat the baby, to let them know you were there, but that it was not daylight (I would nurse and then back to bed, no stimulation); it was not time to get up and be stimulated by lights, tv, etc. This advice SO worked for me with my infant girl.If the book is anything like the show I'm sure it's got GREAT advice for newbies."
4,Excellent book for first time Mums,"This book was like my ""bible"" with my first child who was a premmie right through to when he was a toddler. Then again with my second son there were still dilemmas I hadn't encountered the first time. I found it especially useful as I lived a long way away from family & friends & had to solve my own baby problems.I am now buying it for my daughter in law for their first child & hope they get as much use out of it as I did."
2,Not very helpful,"I purchased this book prior to having my first child, mostly because it looked interesting and the some of the photos are exceptional.Overall it is a very informative overview of child development, especially if you haven't been around young children, and suddenly find yourself a parent. However, if you are looking for a ""how-to"" book, this will not help you. I can't tell you how many times my husband and I flipped through the various chapters looking for some guidance only to be disappointed.Additionally, although you may not agree with the author's opinions you cannot discount the fact that she has written a very thorough book on the stages of young childhood."
5,A Must Have for New Parents,I love this book. When I first received it it sat on the coffee table for about two weeks. Once I picked it up I could not put it down. It is jammed packed with information. I just love it. I give it to all my friends who are also becoming new moms. Great baby manual....
2,Disappointed,"I originally had this book 30 years ago. I relied on it every time I had a question about my child. It HAD an easy way to look up any symptom, rash or ailment that we faced. I purchased the ""updated and revised"" edition as a gift for my daughter- in- law. I reviewed the book before gifting it to her. It was changed so much that it would be of no use to her. I was disappointed that it changed so much. I won't recommend the book to new mothers anymore. :("
1,This book has outdated information.,"Even though this book has been revised, it still has a great deal of outdated information. I did not read the whole book because I read so many inaccurate things that I became concerned about the content. Example; give your baby pieces of raw carrot or apple long before they are 6 months old. Wrong! Major choking hazzard."
4,Great resource.,"The only reason I rated this a four is that it is very wordy.However, it is a great resource. I found it to be full of information I needed. I was able to turn to it for answers to almost all of my questions. This is a very matter of fact book that is based on facts, current studies and information.Everything the author says is backed up with information and facts. THis makes it a very valuable book in my opinion because it is not a parenting book that is based on how this author did it, but an informative book based on all the information we know about babies and young children.Well worth getting."
5,"great, thorough, well written reference book","This is one of my all time favorites and will stay on my reference shelf for a long time. Her style is delightful and she covers key topics in just the right amount of depth. She bases the guidance on common sense and medical accuracy- a refreshing blend that so many other ""expert"" books lack.This is a keeper."
4,great reference book,"This book is great, especially for new parents. I use this book as a reference and have not read this front to back. As I feel every child develops on their own pace. This is a great book and would recommend to others."
4,My toddler's favorite book,"While I can't vouch for the parenting advice in the book, my daughter loves to look at the photos of babies and children in this book. There are tons of sweet color photos to look at, and she will request it multiple times a day and spend a long time going through from cover to cover. She got interested at around 17 months and is still going strong at 19 months."
3,Okay book for a niche subject,"Wetting of materials at elevated temperatures is a niche subject that most engineers and scientists do not encounter. As such there is a dearth of appropriate texts. This text attempts to cover the subject with a mix of science, theory, and applications, with a handy list of references. It is a decent text; easy enough to read for the undergraduate engineering student, yet covers all the related topics.However, I would not recommend purchasing it for three reasons. First is its high price. Second, this text is getting dated in a subject that is continually advancing. Third there is no almost correlation or comparison between experimental methods/results and simulation/modeling."
2,Review of a Gospel,"I was hoping for more changes in the Gospel of Saint John. The editing didn't go far enough.If you are looking to learn something from this book, you will not be able to get anything out of it.Dagober D Runes is better at his other books that he writes from scratch, Editing is not his forte."
3,Not very good in comparison,I did not get the appeal of this movie. I was expecting something light and fun like My Man Godfrey and 5th Avenue Girl (other films made by Gregory La Cava). But this movie was depressing and confusing. I still don't understand why the characters became so upset with each other about lying about their situation and why her stealing problem wasn't a problem. It was confusing with misdirected motivations.
5,ABSOLUTELY INSPIRATIONAL!!,"I usually don't read books, or sometimes I'll start reading a certain book but I'll never finish it. Well for the first time in my entire life I finally found a book that I can finish and fully understand about the book. I was spiritually lost, had little faith...yes I was once a lost sheep. And just like any lost sheep I cried out for my master to save me and this book helped me to realize that GOD IS DEFINITELY, no wrong word...INFINITELY REAL!! For those of you out there who is seeking spiritual help THIS BOOK IS A MUST AND I CAN'T STRESS IT ENOUGH!! GO, STOP READING THIS AND GO GET IT...NOW, DON'T JUST SIT THERE, GIT!!"
4,Christian Inspiration,Barbara Thom does a wonderful job conveying her life experiences and incorporating them into her ministering to others. This book is great for those searching for spiritual growth and would be a wonderful asset for organized faith bible study groups.
4,A must buy for any RPG collector,"Whether you're looking for hundreds of the best battles you'll experience in any RPG on the market or to fight for only what's necessary, the options are entirely yours. For some of us, however, the RPG that took almost a generation to arrive proves that it's indeed good enough to last us Till the End of Time."
2,"Good game, except for one thing","This game was awesome. I love how you could have a free-roam battle system. It made the battles a lot more fun, so basically even if you were really powerful there was still a chance for you to lose. However, this was a 2 disk game.Disk 2 would not work for me. I got a black screen when trying to go on to disk 2. If you are planning on buying this game, keep in mind that you might not be able to finish this game to see how it ends. Just so you know.All in all I think this game gets a 5/5, but their technical support get's a -3/5. Don't expect a replacement after disk 2 won't work. Good luck."
2,Promising but irritating,"I loved Final Fantasy X and X-2. I bought Star Ocean because I wanted something to tide me over until XII.I'm sorry to say that I couldn't make myself continue to play past the first couple of hours. I enjoyed the introductory visuals (with the ships changing to progressively more advanced ships), but the dialog is tiring and endless. Yes, FFX had that problem at times, but it was still engaging.Maybe it gets better later on, but for the period of time I played it, it constantly took over and just started talking and talking and talking. That might be nice if the story was engaging, but I was definitely not drawn in. When I played FFX, I was drawn into it from the start. The same is not true of this game.The combat system is interesting and might well turn out to be fun, but it's not worth it if the story isn't going to improve.If you enjoy all anime (even the cheesy stuff) then maybe you'll find enjoyment here. I didn't."
3,OK GAME,"This game was amazing at the start of the game. I was like, This game could only get better playing through the game. I was wrong. When i put in disc 2. Man it just got boring as heck. The story just fell apart. I gave up and didnt finish til years later. When i beat it. The ending was stuoid. This game got dumb on disc 2. The fight was awesome. Loved the battle and graphics. Just the story line got dumb as heck. This game could of been amazingly awesome. But they killed it on disc 2. Im giving it 3 star. Loved the Graphics and loved the battle system"
4,it's official,i got a chance to play this game when i first played it in my friends house. it wasn't the best rpg ever made. but the gameplay is worth playing and the graphics are nice.
5,A diamond in the vast desert of RPGs,"SO3 is an astonishing game....THE GOOD-Ridiculusly long (nearly 200 hours if you play the entrie postgame) yet never gets repetive.-Unique battle system, you see enmies, and can engage in a fight with them or try to dodge them-Invention system, very fun to try and make uber weapons and armor-Very deep storyline, with a very nice plot twist wich you will either love or hate- Just plain fun!THE BAD-too many characters, you will have to play a few times to choose a good party of 3 and stick with it-Absurdly long cinematics (the first 3 hours are watched not played....)-Invention system involves alot of presing X X X X X X X X (DOH i missed the right price range) X X X X X;.....THE UGLY-Hmm....-Uh...-*Crickets chirping*"
2,okay but the second disc dosent work,the game was good but when you get passed the first disc the second one dosent work so whats the point it's a waste of time buy from someone else
4,Star Ocean Till the End of Time,"It's a good RPG, very detailed with good graphics. Some cut scenes are very long, keeping it from being a 5 star game. But, it has an excellent story line, keeps the interest going. I ended up getting a game guide for it, the maps are poorly detailed and the invention process confusing. I enjoy RPGs', and have been playing for many years, this game will be a game I enjoy many times, as I tend to play them over and over until I understand the game. Worth the money."
2,"Good gameplay, terrible story","The graphics were great. The battle system was different than most RPGs, but it was ok. The gameplay was pretty good (like camera angles, manuverability, ect.) But there were a lot of things I didn't like. The story line started out ok but got really boring and was kinda stupid as it progressed. And the end was terrible. The 30 mins or so it took to watch it could have been much better spent doing ANYTHING else. I also didn't like the method for upgrading weapons. You had to recruit people to make stuff, make certain items and then add it your weapon. But they never made anything all that great for me (and I spent many hours trying). I think this game was a flop."
1,Not an true two player game,"This product is sold as being for two players. When in fact the only time two players can play is in battle scenes. The rest of the time the other player has no control over the game at all, other then to sit and wait for the main player to get into a fight. There is no disclaimer on the package stating that the two-player mode is only for battle scenes. This is just away to rip off customers who are looking for true two player games. As most everyone knows when you buy a game and take it home then open it, (IT IS YOUR'S)no money back because you do not like it or because of shady packaging statements. The company that marketed the game gets their money, the store gets their money and the customer gets ripped off. If I could give less then one star I would have!"
2,Paint drying or this game?,This game is very boring. I managed to play about 2 hours but could not do it anymore.The story line was lacking and the I found myself not caring if my character survived or not.I had heard a lot of good things about this RPG and certainly am open to different types of RPGS but this one had me reaching for the Power button . Perhaps I will try again but my first impression is I would rather watch paint dry.
5,GREAT!!,"Very fun game along with a great story line. I've played Star Ocean games since the days of PS1, and the whole series has always been underrated. This game is definitely worth buying."
5,Star Ocean is full of Five Star value,"The game has excellent graphics (though sometimes they may look a little off...) and the story is also very good. The characters are pretty likable, and depending on which characters you prefer depends on which ones go with you til the end of the game. Depending on your relationship with them can also change the ending. The game has a ton of cut scenes, but I have yet to find one cutscene I didn't like. BUT, the switch from the ""easy"" level to ""normal"" is a hard one-I felt like there was a huge difference in the monster's power. Overall though, it's still a great game."
2,a good attempt at a poor game,"First off this game had me hooked all the way till I got stuck and put the game down for a week, after that week I started to realize why I didnt like the game. First off the game is very tedious, I'm not a big fan of MMORPG's and the battle system felt very much like one, boring. Second of all the story was great till the second disc and the ending was enough to make me want to throw this game into a trash compactor!!!!! the graphics were decent the cut scenes were great, but the fun factor and replay value of this game are equvalant to that of superman 64"
3,well i expected just a little more,"well, the game is decent but thats all it will ever be. the positives are the amazing graphics. Square Enix has always been the best RPG makers. The worlds are very detailed and the characters are pretty cool.the battle system is also very cool but will take some time to get used to. But the story lacks interest, i mean i couldnt even finish the game because it was kinda boring. I mean this game is no match for the final fantasy series. It is extremly easy to get lost which is extremely annoying. It took 5 hours to find my way around this one cave thing. well like i said its decent but thats all. if you decide to buy this game you should buy a strategy guide."
4,star ocean,"This is a sequeal from the star ocean saga. The first version released in Japan had a several bug problem. Thus most of them were pull back, now the newly released version suppose to be better and even have different costumes for the character. There are up to 6 playable character, and Fate is the one you start with. It also has mutiple ending, especially depend on which character you choose to battle in the final chapter."
4,"VERY FUNNY , BUT A BIT TOOO LONG","THIS IS A GOOD GAME , FUNNY , VERY I THINK YOU BETTER BOUGHT SOME FINAL FANTASY , THIS IS A BIT TOO LONG AND THE FIGHT SYSTEM IS A LITTLE BORING, BUT IN GENERAL IS A GOOD GAME"
1,RPG fan BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all the real reason why they call this game Star Ocean Till The End Of Time is because youll be playing it till the end of time. This game has two fricken discs and I think they could of cut it down about 3 quarters. The storyline sucks I mean I was trying to look past it but its pretty hard when the first 4 hours are you walking around a beach looking for your parents. The stroy line has no effect on you, the characters suck, most of the game youll be talking to these crappy characters. I haven't even gotten started on the combat First of all the combat is ok when you first start it but then it gets complicated its completely real time so they want you to open different menues during the game when your opponents are beating the living s@#* out of you. So by the time you find the spell you want your dead. And plus you don't get a sword until almost halfway through the game"
4,Star Ocean,"This game was not as good as the second one. since the dungeon designs looked same, the battle system was not that fun. still the story makes up for it and the background visuals."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This book was a huge disappointment to me! I have a compulsion to finish every book I start but this one made that task very difficult! Jordan was such a pig headed jerk! And Amanda was such a coward! He practically turned her into a whore forcing her to marry him to help her family financially. I picked this book up at a garage sale and next summer I'll be selling it in mine. Janet, you've come a long way baby!"
2,Mixed blessings,"The music is all that you would expect: spirited, played with joy and passion. Unfortunately this is a recording of an outdoor concert and the sound has the most annoying hum throughout I have heard on a recording in long long time, making any portions where the music is not playing full blast unlistenable. Quite unfortunate since the spoken word portions are important in this type of performance. That this album is released without a warning of the technical issues on the cover is reprehensible. I plan on buying ""Hope"" and am keeping my fingers crossed that the music is as good, but that the recording is not cursed by the sound. By the way, no: this does not add to the charm by providing a ""you are there"" experience. The sound was probably just as annoying for the audience. To call it ""Live at the BBC"" adds to my feeling of having been suckered by this one... I sincerely believed it was a live recording in a BBC studio."
2,Who the heck is conducting this thing?,"I know this is a great piece of music. Inspired the scores for hundreds of western movies. I also consider it a mission to search out servicable classical bargain recordings for newbies who want to sample a lot of music or students who have to feed that portable CD player on a tight budget. This version of Dvorak's 9th doesn't cut it - & I score leniently!! Sluggish tempi, muddy sound, some very slipshod playing at times. & who the heck is conducting this thing? You can do a lot better for under six bucks.If this CD is DDD, my name is Dom DeLuise Dvorak."
2,Shallow and Boring - lacks Vision,"As a scientist working in some of the cutting edge technologies described in the book, I was totally bored reading it. It was a dredge moving from page to page. The science in it is accurate enough, but the author does little more than put blocks on top of each other and say ""that's possible so it will happen."" If you're into reading lengthy catalogues of neat gadgets, this book is fine. But if you're looking for vision, you won't find it here.For example, the book totally neglects the simple fact that the number one financial source driving present-day research is the military. Instead he paints a rosy world where deadly military applications don't exist, and all science is for the service of mankind. Unfortunately, thanks to the science he so much praises, the civilian world as we know it might not exist in 20 or 50 years."
2,Expired,For now (2012) this book is expired. Michio Kaku is great but this book is not actual anymore. One you start to read it you can see that technologies are already not Future.
4,Visons by Michio Kaku,I bought this book as a kindle version and i have enjoyed it very much...I have always been interested in Michio and what he has to say...
5,Genius,"Kaku has a way of explaining mind-boggling concepts in a very understandable way. I think that's what makes him so appealing. He ponders unbelievable ideas and explains them in plain English, but doesn't dumb-down the complicated and intricate details of these un-fathomable inceptions.Remarkable!"
5,Majority Inclusion,"Kaku delivers a balanced description of the direction of the human species for the next one hundred years. He uses an inclusive writing style that can be understood easily by the technically oriented, as well as the scientifically retarded.The arguments for human technical advancement are explained in a believable and logical order. Kudos for Kaku."
2,A Letdown,"After reading Hyperspace I wanted more from Michio Kaku, and this was not it. Yes, it was from Kaku, but it was nothing like Hyperspace. This book is mostly just a series of predictions about the future, most of which are wild speculation, even though the basic physics behind them is solid. If that's what you're looking fro, you've found it. However, don't expect to be overly impressed. Read one of Kaku's other books... they have SO MUCH more to offer."
2,I Just Couldn't Give It Three Stars,"The best part of this reasonable attempt to prognosticate the course of humanity over the next hundred years or so, is that the author spoke to many of those who are ""in the know.""But history is littered (as they say) with visions which have remained only dreams. For instance, the Internet caught even Bill Gates napping, according to the popular wisdom! It was staring him in the eye and he didn't see it until it bit him in the rear end.This is a nice survey of where we are and what our imaginations are saying to us right now, but it is exceedingly hard to really see beyond the next decade or so, so most of this book is probably good only for entertainment and/or inspiration. And that's not bad.But it only gets two stars. It wasn't really all that entertaining."
5,A spellbinding look at the future.,"The strength of this book is Kaku's ability to summarize years of research and hundreds of interviews into a spellbinding view based on the visions of hundreds of scientists who are tops in their field. He manages to weave a tapestry amoung three scientifific revolutions that are taking place as we speak and predict with scientific logic how advances in computers, biology, and quantum physics will affect mankind over the next twenty years, fifty years, one-hundred years and beyond. He describes some facinating possibilities that the human race is capable of acheiving through science as long as he develops the ability to understand and respect the awesome power it gives him and avoid the pitfalls."
3,Occasionally outdated but still interesting,"Would prefer to give 3 1/2 stars.If you like books predicting the future of technology, you'll consider it a 4 star.Thought provoking, fairly well-written, but shows its age in places."
5,A Physicist Looks at the Future,"Superstring physicist Michio Kaku turns his eyes to the future, and sees many bright developments in the 21st century. What is really remarkable about this book is Kaku's ability to explain in a clear way how the Quantum revolution of the turn of the previous century has dramatically effected, or perhaps invented, the three great revolutions of the 20th century: computers, biotechnology, and quantum physics. Kaku is especially good in outlining his reasons for his view of the future; and gives pretty reasonable timelines for the achievement of certain goals. The book is easy for a layperson to read and understand, and gives a good overview of scientific development. Well worth reading, at times profound."
4,toxicity issues,"I liked the book in that it introduces many cutting edge technologies. However, Mr. Kaku should mention that some of these technologies have serious toxicity problems. For instance, carbon nanotubes could cause lung disease similar to asbestosis or mesothelioma."
2,Expect to Buy Lamps,"Lamp went out a month after warranty. panasonic has had a class action law suit settled regarding a handful of tv's with this lamp (this model not included). but if you search the internet enough you'll find the lamp is the problem. i have a 67"" samsung a year longer and no lamp issue. i expect my tv's lamp to last more than 18 months. if you do too, do not pursue Panasonic LCDs"
5,Mind Blowing,"This is not an easy album to review. I don't agree that this is a difficult album. This is an amazing album. I love Melody Nelson, but i don't think there are any similarities, these are totally different albums, don't compare them. If you want something nice that creates an atmosphere to play in the back round don't get this. When you listen to this be ready to be torn out of your present reality and plunged into something you've never experienced. L' Enfant Assasin des Mouches, plays like a genius concept album. Buy this buy this buy this, holy crap buy this. Way ahead of its time. Buy it!"
3,DeJa Vu Somewhat OK,The game came in a nice timely fashion and all I can say is that I was very pleased
2,Thelma and Louise rip-off,"Am I the only one who noticed a remarkable similarity to the plot of this story and the movie Thelma & Louise? The only thing missing is Jessica having sex with the Brad Pitt-style drifter (and it is implied that she wanted to). The ending is even the same, although it has the criminal, not the twins driving off a cliff. The only reason I gave it as high a rating as two stars is becuase it is a page turner, despite the almost shameless plagarizing of the Thelma & Louise plotline."
5,Good reminder of who Jesus is.,"I went to a Lutheran grade school and learned all the bible stories, starting in Kindergarten. So for me, this book was just a reminder of the stories about Jesus, but they were told in a very easy to understand fashion. I had read the book Joshua, written by Joseph Girzone, and really enjoyed that, so I thought I would give this book a look. I was hoping for a little more input of ideas from the author, but he told the stories pretty much the same way that the Bible tells them. Not that that's a bad thing for someone trying to learn about Jesus. But for me, I was looking for more of his personal opinion on the subject matter, since Jesus spoke using metaphors and parables, it's refreshing hearing how other people explain them, the way they understand them to be, this was not the case though. I believe somebody else had brought up this point also. It's still worth the time."
5,Best Full Summary of the Bible,"Dr. Timmons book is a much needed reference guide to the Bible. And at times it's entertaining as well as clear and understandable to a generalist layperson, not just specialists in the field of hermeneutics. It is a fine ""Cliff-Notes"" type summary and also gives some historical background to the various sections of the Bible. It's even captivating for casual reading. I keep a copy at my bedside. In fact, I find it more useful than the Bible itself. His coverage of Revelations is a revelation of itself."""
5,Diversity is your best bet,"The final work on this superb CD is one of Vivaldi's true masterworks. Like his incredibly famous Four Seasons, this work has true inspiration and a sound that is second to none. This Concerto in C is written for an astonishing array of diverse instruments. My favorite is the one that sounds just like a clarinet, although the clarinet, as we know it today, was not invented until decades later. This is a work that musicians just seem to absolutely adore. This is my third recording of this piece and in each case the performance has had amazing enthusiasm. It is a work that should be in everybody's library. Unless you have a strong dislike for the baroque or Vivaldi, you should enjoy this music. The rest of the music here is standard Vivaldi. It is interesting and has wonderful sounds, but not really inspired. However, at the budget price, the CD is well worth the money for the one masterpiece it has."
2,Cyberball-NES,"The game begins simply enough, however, the simplicity quickly begins to bring it down. The developer attempted to make the football experience seem robotic, but with rough graphics it is too hard to tell what is even happening on the field. Good reasons to play this game are the simplicity and quick adaptation. It is easy to score and play. However, the reasons not to play this game include a lack of actual music/sound, the inability to choose your team in the exhibition play (red or blue), and the lack of originality. Bottom line: if you are a collector then of course you will buy this game, however, if you are looking for an NES American Football game then Tecmo Bowl is for you!"
1,Stunk with a capitol S!,"This book was poor in plot and interest. There were too many different stories going on at once that you don't realize until the end which one you are supposed to be focused on. Then you don't really care. Its boring and a waste of time. I don't recommend this book for anyone, I'm just glad I got it on sale for 2.99 at a warehouse book store!"
2,Last Night Remorse,"Katie Roiphe searched for the pulse of sexuality in America. She interviewed high school and college students and came to the conclusion that everyone's scared of sex and AIDS and they all resent the fact that they missed the sexual revolution.But Roiphe only interviewed students from elite schools which mimicked her own upbringing, almost to validate her own fears and sexual hang-ups. Her sister is HIV positive, so naturally, she is consumed with thoughts of AIDS. But instead of taking ownership for these feelings, which should be the case in a first-person book, she projects those feelings on the country. She's not comfortable with people having sex with multiple partners at once, so she gloms on to the fact that this may be how Magic Johnson got AIDS.If Roiphe regrets her own promescuity, that's a valid feeling and an interesting topic for a book. But assuming the country's morals automatically align with hers is arrogant, and probably inaccurate"
1,Ghoulish sibling rivalry,"There's something deeply creepy about the use the Roiphster is making of her sister's HIV+ status. Never a writer in control of her effects, Roiphe weeps crocodile tears but you see her between the lines, choreographing the step she'll dance on her vanquished rival's grave. ""Ha-hah, you're dead and I'm a famous writer and handbag model, ha-hah, now I've got mommy all to myself."" Till that day, she can still spin a buck out of the situation. Other than that, I have no idea what the point of this book is meant to be."
3,This is more of a historical factual acct.,"This is very informative for ""the facts only"" but it barely covers the emotional and the heavy burdens of sadness and turmoil that women and children went through on the Oregon Trail. As a woman I am interested in the women's lives on the trail. This was from the point of view of men and barely if at all covered how women functioned and cooked and cleaned (with what?) on the trail. They just said where the trail started and finished and such without the real emotional parts that I wanted to hear.It is neat however that we got to go on the trail as it shows it from beginning to end. I know what the trail looked like now. It just was lacking something more is all.:)"
3,"Good account, but no heart",This is a very plain presentation of what was really a very passionate trek. These people embodied the American Dream. They made their future by crossing a continent. This passion is lacking from this recounting of the Oregon Trail.
2,New? Really?,"Box was beaten and broken, taped up and looked as if it had sat around for years. Luckily it was only chocolates to be eaten, but the Christmas gift could have still looked better!"
3,Great costume bad sizing,"I purchased this costume for my daughter and since she was in 9M size clothes I got her the 12M size costume. The costume was delivered fast but could have fit a 2 or 3 year old. The seller would not exchange the costume for another size, so I am stuck with a costume that is the wrong size."
4,Very cute,"This is a very cute caterpillar costume, and it looks great on my daughter. It is a little big like others have said. She was 12 months at Halloween and the costume was loose on her, but still cute. It will probably be a good fit for her next year.Update: 1 year later, and my daughter is now 2 years old. The 12 month size costume is still too big!"
1,too large and incomplete,"The costume was way too large for a 12 month old and it was missing the head piece, so I returned it for a refund 3-4 weeks ago, still waiting for the refund."
1,A worthless piece of junk,This D tube folding luggage cart was inexpensive but absolutely did not work. The handle was too short for even a short person to comfortably hold on to. I had to stoop over to pull my luggage with this. It also has a very annoying whirring sound as it rolled along. Finally after just one use the handle bent and I had to throw it away. Buyer beware! It is as light as they seller claims but it is basically a piece of junk. I bought a nice luggage cart in an airport store which is working just great. It cost a bit more but it is worth it.
1,Disappointed,"Instructions very difficult to use, nor does it work for denser veggies such as carrots or kohlrabi.In general, a huge disappointment and almost impossible to work. I wish I could return it!!!SR in Denver"
1,Dangerous,This product is very awkward in its design and I consider it dangerous. I would highly recommend safety gloves when using this slicer. The plastic body is porous and is hard to keep clean and it is cheaply made out of plastic.
2,Website photo doesn't match what you will receive,Beware when you order this product that the website photo is of the larger version (white) but what you get is the small little green one.Even the box it comes in has the larger white version printed on it! Very misleading. I actually have the larger version and thought I was getting the same thing when I ordered it again for a gift. Note that the larger version is a great product and I would rate it 5 stars for the price and durability. The small one is ok if all you want to slice is a little strawberry...
1,"Clumsy, awkward!",I found this product clumsy and difficult to use. Hard to get a peeled potato to push through easily. Also tried a tomato - a real mess. Back to the trustu Cuisinart for me!
4,Like the product,"I really have enjoyed using the slicer, easy to use, easy to clean.Most of my friend has this and I recommend this product as well."
5,"Wow, works like it should!","We purchased this mandolin to make it easier for salad prep slicing (ie. mushrooms, cucumbers, carrots) but have found it such a breeze to use that we now prep countless dishes with the slicer. We have been using it for a few months now and the blades have stayed sharp and slice through a tomato just like the day we first tried it. We are very pleased and easily give it five stars, the guard is basically useless however, but the mandolin aspect is what I am rating and easily give it five stars."
2,Poorly designed,"I wanted to love this, as I bought this on the recommendation of other professional cooks for its zippiness, simplicity, and sharp blades. I am pretty adept in the kitchen, but this tool is unsafe if you decide to use the flimsy finger guard. Also, the blades were not sharp enough to handle hard veggies, such as carrots, gracefully, so I was left struggling trying to jam them across the blade, the finger guard trying its best to go off track each time. The finger guard should be higher and somehow secure better to the track. Worker's comp not worth the risk--I'll stick w/ Bron!"
4,"Works great, very sharp, use carefully","I have had this mandolin for over two years now. I use it regularly for cucumber, apple, carrot, potato, cabbage... The blade is sharp, and I agree with other reviews, the safty guard is not very effective. However, I have never cut myself using the mandolin. I wash and dry it after each use, and have no problem with rusting. In fact, I just bought one for my parents because they were impressed with it. My Japanese friend also has one. It's practically in every home in Japan. Don't think you can find another good mandolin at this price. Giving it 4-star review because the safty guard can be improved."
4,It's okay,"I used it once to slice a large red onion. I should have probably ordered the wider version of this, because the slicer is just a bit too narrow. The slicer did cut the onion just fine, and quickly."
1,"Item not as on picture. I got cheaper, smaller version. Be careful.",I bought 5 of it. I got another cheaper slicer. Smaller size and with cheaper plastic screws for blade.At this moment I would like to warn potential buyers to avoid this cheating.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VZ57C/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
4,Beringer Japanese mandoline slicer,"This mandoline slicer has worked well for quick, no fuss slicing of vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce, carrots and such. Makes great potato chips if smaller potatoes are used. In hindsight, I would have purchased a unit that was a 1/2 again wider to accommodate larger-sized vegetables. No real set-up time and quick clean. Small size makes storage a snap. I also wish that I had purchased additional standard blades at the same time. The finger guard is a must because the blades are very sharp."
3,mandoline,"The mandoline is not sharp as it was described. Other than special inserts, it works as any other slicer."
1,Blade dull only after a few use,"It was great the first time I used it. However just after a few use, it became hard and even dangerous to use."
3,Good for everything BUT SLICES,"The slicer blade cuts only very thin slices, so I can't really use it for anything but cucumber or daikon for salad. I used my older slicer for cutting eggplant, zucchini etc to make roasted veggies for sandwiches and this is useless for softer vegetables. I am looking for a slicer with adjustable thickness now. Both graters - thick and think - work excellent for me. I grated carrots, daikon, beets, potatoes and zucchini with ease for latkes."
3,not what I really wanted,I most the time get disappointment shopping Amazon for one thing these reviews. I am not blaming anyone and too ill to return the disappointing Mandolin I found not impressive but it is too small to cut like a small half ham and I had a mandolin that did but it has gotten dull after many years use this is just too narrow for most things I like to cut. I have no complaint on the seller just the product was not what I expected.Shirley Farnsworth
2,Dont pay extra for deleivery.,I asked a friend in the Dominican republic if I could bring him anything he asked me to bring Benriner Japanese Mandoline Slicer.I ordered it on line and paid 30 dollars extra so that it would be here for me to bring and it arrived in 5 days. I was hoping to bring it with me but it took 5 day in stead of 3 days that I had paid for.
3,Benriner Japanese Mandolin Slicer,It works fairly well but the safety device is very hard to grab and there are too many parts to lose track of.
2,Too Small,"Too narrow at 2.5 inches to slice a whole medium tomato. Does nicely on cucumbers and thumbs. I suggest you select a wider, 4 inches minimum, Mandoline."
2,"slices well, but be careful","I want a new slicer because I tend to find this one difficult to use...the thickness adjustment is not even -my slicer warped a bit. Also, I have cut myself a couple times as the guard is not useful at all. Do yourself a favor and get a more advanced model."
4,using it,I really have enjoyed using the slicer. I do a lot of raw foods and it certainly speeds up the process.
5,My mom loved it,"My mom loved it so much she made me log into Amazon just to give it 5 stars x_X So there it is, she uses it for salads and stuff, the blades are of good solid construction, you could julienne your fingers with this to your wrist and still be sharp!"
4,Good product that could use some improvements,"This handy tool works great for slicing and makes quick work of julienned veggies to a UNIFORM SIZE. I found it easy to clean, a breeze to assemble and change blades, and it takes up very little space in your kitchen. My main complaints:- Safety guard is not too safe! Haven't had any accidents yet (knock on wood) but it is clear that it would be very easy to slice your fingers on this thing.- Could use a stand/hook or some way to make holding the mandolin easier while handling slippery/wet produce"
1,Ugh! So disappointed.,"I was looking for a practical guide for introducing more healthy food into my daily diet. This book is not it. It's just another treatise on why processed food is killing us (yes, we know), and it turns out the author is another Sally Fallon convert who espouses questionable advice to consume raw milk, organ meats and pork fat on a regular basis, despite claiming in the beginning of the book that diet research all points to the same conclusions. No, it doesn't. High fat=higher risk of stroke, cancer and heart disease. Same goes for animal products. Stay away!"
1,not a dictionary for people with a good vocabulary,"I purchased this book for a bedside reference. I think I'd prefer the dictionary of obscure and interesting words rather than this. All the obvious words are in there -- 'the' 'frog,' etc., but if you encounter a word you don't know, this isn't the dictionary for it. Instead, I'm back lugging up and down the stairs my unabriged webster's."
5,One of the best mystery books I read in a long time.,The reading was so enjoyable that I just did not want the book to end. I strongly recommend it. I can not wait for W. H. Denney next Joe Pereira mistery.
3,Delivery doesn't match topic,"A book like this should have more pictures. The ones it does have don't have captions. The writing is fairly ameteurish but does have some interesting stuff despite being from an angle I didn't like. I didn't like the big black pages with the white lettered quotes not just because some of the quotes weren't especially good, but because you can't read the middle that is in the binding and seems to be poor quality ink or paper. All around this book is just okay, great topic, poor delivery."
2,not the best,"I'm a huge Audrey fan but this one kind of leaves me cold. There are much better selections out there, shop around"
5,A book Audrey would be happy with,"I am a huge admirerer of Audrey Hepburn, and knowing much about her, I have to say that this book is written very well. There are a few mistakes, but overlook them. This is hte first bio I have read on her where the author sounds as if she cared for Audrey very much, and there are no lies in the book. It contains over 90 pics of Audrey never before seen! It is s'wonderful!"
5,A lovely book about a lovely creature.,"Forget about the monthly fashion magazines that grace the bookstore shelves and which become dated within a few weeks. If you want to learn true style and eternal beauty, THIS IS THE BOOK. Yes, I have been an Audrey Hepburn fan since I was seven, but regardless of one's feelings about her, anyone can learn a thing or three from this book about how to live life in a way that reflects the simple beauty within each of us. The book is rich in insight regarding Audrey Hepburn's life and philosophy, which influenced her style tremendously. Ms. Keogh doesn't set out to tell us how to BE Audrey Hepburn, since of course that would be impossible as there could never be another one like her again. Rather, she tells us how she developed and found her style, and how we too can find our very own, in the true spirit of Audrey Hepburn."
5,lessons in elegance,"Visually perfect, inspirational, so moving it made me cry, this book is the most exquisite thing to look at, and one of the most entertaining and yet spiritually profound reads. Highest reccomendations, and a suggestion: Buy extras, you will end up ""loaning"" your copy away. You can never have too many of this book."
3,"Good book for beginners, but ...","This book does a good job to describe the major Jungian archetypes in the beginning, but in actually uncovering and explaining them in various movies (etc.) it falls a bit short. The book seems to provide plot summaries more than pychoanalytical explanations (how many of us need a decription of what really happens in star wars??!!) You should buy it if you are new to both Jung and Sci Fi, and if not both then borrow this book form your library!!"
1,The children hated it.....,"My boys, avid Bob the Builder fans, can't stand this CD. I was very dissapointed with it myself. We listened to it a few times the day we got it, and haven't listened to it since. We own every Bob DVD that has come out- but we'll probably give this away."
1,NOT the Bob the Builder your toddler LOVES!,"This album was a great disappointment to my 21 month son who is a huge Bob the Builder fan. None of the voices are from the U.S. version of the show (understanding the show originated in Britian). However since the U.S. version IS what our son has seen/is used to hearing it was such a shock to us that beefy Bob the Brit blasted out of the CD player. Our son cried, shaked the CD case at us and asked for Bob over and over. We STRONGLY advise not buying this for little guys...they'll sadly be disappointed!"
4,If MAx likes it.....,My 3yr old heard this CD and flipped out. I play it in the car and it's really kinda catchy...plus he sings and sings and sings. I say it's A MUST HAVE for a real Bob fan
5,Happy,"This is a very cute album, we love it at home! It's upbeat and great to dance to, with all lyrics suitable for toddler and up! My daughter had this on audio cassette in 2003, now that my baby is nearly 2, we have upgraded to cd."
1,VERY UPSET,"My kids were very upset when we got home with this CD. I had no idea that it wasn't ""BOB"" as we know him. I do understand that the show is British, but if they took the time to revoice the show for American audiences, why didn't they do the same for the CD, surely they could afford it. It is false advertising to sell this here in the states without letting the consumer know that it isn't the voices we know. VERY UPSET!!"
4,Fun CD for kids and parents.,"The reviewer you picked is a little nuts! Duh, Bob the Builder is British! It is ""translated"" to OUR kids, they didn't just change it for the CD. (And by the way, it's ""tiling"" on the roof, not toiling!This CD is fun with real dance-type music. My kids love it because there are so many sound bites of the characters. I give it an 'A'."
4,Great,"My son loves this CD, we only listen to this song in the car. The only song he dosen't really like is the spud song. I have already heard most of these songs on the DVD movies."
4,Good book,"This is a good book for anyone wanting to develop a basic knowledge of user-centred design. Unfortunately, it's now a somewhat outdated book. It's cost is extremely disproportionate with its current value. ($30 would be more adequate). I recommend, instead, Brenda Laurel's ""Design Research""."
3,"Nice book, shame about the content...","An interesting if somewhat dated ideology placing the graphic designer in the position of the instigator of positive social change. A sort of paper social conscience for the masses. Designers must unite and use their collective power for good and triumph over all that is evil. While many of the arguments are trite and shop worn, this book does justify coffee table space. The actual book itself is more interesting than it's content."
4,Great Album,"I've been buying alot of albums recently and this is one of my favorites. I am a big fan of brit music ever since I started listening to The Beatles awhile ago. There music is unique though ""No Kind of Life"" sounded reminiscent of The Editors style of music. I thought I was gonna be disappointed with the music after the first track but I was wrong. This is because I heard the song ""Neon"" which struck a cord with me. The sorta bluesy opening with the harmonica really got me going. If you are looking for a good rock album pick up this one you wont be dissapointed."
5,FIVE BRIGHT STARS,"Amber is CLEARLAKES most mature production. If you like pure British rock this is something you can't miss. I found myself listening the great song ""No Kind of Life"" again and again and I must say that beyond the great music this work has amazing lyrics. There is no doubt that you should listen this cd."
4,Great guitar rock,I've been listening to this one over and over. The prduction match the songs perfectly.
3,biographer got in the way,"THE MEETING OF ANNI ADAMS could have been a lean & luminous biography of one teenager's survival during horrific times. It ended up being an overview of the era from the Treaty of Versailles in 1918 at the end of World War I to World War II, & the arrival Tech. Sgt. Charlie Donnell Adams on the beachhead of Normandy D-Day+36.As a primer of those times, THE MEETING OF ANNI ADAMS is actually quite good. As the story of a person's life, it's an overwrought, under-edited pulpit for the biographer."
5,A Survivor from Luxembourg,"Just finished reading your book ""The Butterfly of Luxembourg"". Despite all the hardships you had to endure, I am convinced that you had and still have a very exciting life. Too bad we were unable to get together when you were in Luxembourg. Although I am a few years younger, I did have similar experiences during the war. We had to leave for France on May 10th as refugees. I was only five then, but I do recall some bad experiences although not quite as bad as yours.A lady in New York who worked for the Luxembourg Consulate General received your book from a friend in Florida who saw it, I guess, in your flower shop. Small world. I, of course, purchased it in Luxembourg at the ""Messageries du livre""Congratulations for having the courage to write the book and for having such a phantastic memory.Warmest regards from Luxembourg"
2,It's like Legend of Kage....,"...only a little more advanced.You do have a lifebar,but it depleets very quickly.Lots of high jumping enimies that throw stars and slash at you.The only thing I really liked about this game was the music during the levels.Only pay $3-$5 maximum for this.The game reviewer ""a zz"" who gave it five stars in a one sentence review and posted it twice was just trying to be funny.This game is pretty terrible and he's an idiot."
3,"Effective, but lots of detailed work!","I've been only able to implement a few things. And this is from someone who has lost 60 lbs in two years. I really do like the whole program. However, you need lots of time to figure it out, if not a personal assistant to set it up for you."
2,Fat Flush Program,The concepts of this program makes sense. It is however very restictive and too difficult to follow in my busy life. I did however take some of the stategies and apply them to my life; such as drinking the flaxseed oil and the 64 oz of unseetened cranberry juice. I was unable to give up my morning coffee but have tried to do the hot lemon water before my first cup.
5,Great Book Set,If you are looking for a book to help you lose the unwanted lbs around your mid area this is the combo book set you need. Very easy to follow the directions on how to do the program. Foods are all wholesome and good for you. Not to sure about the supplements that are to be taken with the diet. I only used the foods and they worked the same I'm guessing without the supplements because I lost unwanted lbs following only the food list in the book. This is also a great deal on the price if you were to look up each book and try to buy them individually it would cost you more. Good Luck.
5,The diet for those who have tried everything else!,"Following an accident which really restricted my movements for nearly two years, I put on a lot of weight. Sixteen years and umpteen failed diets later I was getting heavier and heavier. I was beginning to read all those ""Fat is beautiful"" books, and was resolving to settle for a fat old age. Then I saw this plan and never looked back. I reached my target in less than 8 months, losing 63 pounds on the way. I feel great, and know I have found the way to stay slim for the rest of my life. I have maintained my weight loss now for over 6 months and follow the guidelines for Phase 3 at home and eat pretty much what I want when out.The Complete Fat Flush Plan is a bargain....I paid a lot more for the individual books! Get them...you deserve to feel this healthy and trim! The books explain that it is not the slimmer who fails, but the diets that fail them! This plan understands all about our bodies needs and educates us to understand them too!"
1,Terrible,This book is full of total nonsense. I suppose if you want to hang by your fingernails you can lose weight too. It was supposed to be an easy way to lose weight. I found it to be so difficult to follow and stick to. I joined Weight Watchers instead and am glad I did. Save your money join Weight Watchers.
3,good read,this program may work if you really put an effort in to it its hard to stay on a diet and even harder to follow if you dont have access to some foods
1,Just another low calorie diet,"I bought the Fat Flush Plan book with high hopes that it would help me lose the 30 pounds of extra weight I have accumulated over the years. After following phase 1 as prescribed, not only did I not lose weight, but I had headaches, felt lousy and had no energy. This is just another repackaged, low-calorie weight loss plan. Not sure the science behind it is that sound either. Into the trash it goes..."
1,Just Flush it!,"THe complete fat flush program is an impossibility for most. The time it takes to shop for, prepare, and consume would be a full time job. Not to mention that you are suppose to drop everything to search out all ""organic"" meats, veggies and even juice! I did learn some interesting facts about how to increase bile production.Just add some lemon to your water, cut back on your portions and enjoy life!"
2,Diet hype revisited,Way too complicated. Then you needed to purchase special products and living in a small town many items needed were not available. I was very disappointed and learned my lesson. Just eat less of all types of food
4,Great Book,"I enjoyed reading Dead On. It was well written and had some great twists and turns. The setting, theme, and plot were quite unique. Ann Kelly seems to have knack for capturing place and time. Throughout the book, she transitioned these elements quite well, which kept me reading and wondering what would happen next.Aberrations"
1,Did these people read the same book I did?,"The book is horribly written, poorly edited and completely boring. The 'romance' is about as thrilling as the one between Anakin and Padme.It switches points of view like crazy, uses cliches and run on sentances, and just stinks. The story is not strong enough to make you forget about the horrid construction. Hell, I'm on page 95 and I don't think it's started yet. Three murders and a threatening note does *not* equal a 'story'.This book is a joke. Ann Kelly, iUniverse, and everyone involved in getting this to the public (including the reviewers here) should be ashamed of themselves.It's rare for me to not finish a book, especially one which is only 196 pages long with chapters the size of walnuts, but I don't think I can stomach this one much longer.I purchased the book based on the glowing recommendations I read here. I will *not* be doing that *ever* again. I want my money back."
5,"Great story, great writing","Ann Kelly combines highly eloquent writing with a very absorbing story. The book is a must-read for anybody who appreciates a good mystery and savors skillful use of the language. Dead On is worth reading more than once. While it's a page-turner, don't read too fast or you'll miss the strong descriptions. The characters and scenery are portrayed beautifully, and the book is a bonus for anybody who is familiar with Bucks County."
5,A Powerful Tool In The Hands Of A Martial Student,"Growing up under the shallow instruction of American martial arts had always left a gaping hole in my soul. The macho Chuck Norris style of external toughness didn't provide the spiritual guidance that completes oneself. Beyond the Known is a series of parables that uses subtle wisdom to lead the reader towards a greater self-awareness. Sage advice in the form of practical teachings opened my mind up to the world outside of the arts allowing me to accept and understand a more enlightened way to embrace my journey. This book is a powerful tool in the hands of a martial student, it can help a warrior become whole."
1,A confusing story with very little of the Doctor! Bad story!,"This new story has the Doctor,Fitz and Compassion attempting to solve the problems of a king and his kingdom! The old friend of the Doctor's Iris Wildtyme returns too in this book! The first half is easy to follow the second is very confusing! I'd recommend this (and use my real name) if the second half was not confusing! Buy this book only if you need to catch up on the series ,otherwise skip this mess of a new adventure with the eighth doctor!"
2,No more Isis Wyldtime!,"I've now read three stories (two novels, one short story) with Isis, and my opinion hasn't changed: poor writing, convoluted, nonsense plots--no more! The Blue Angel had a couple good moments (the Star Trek parody was fun--to a point), but it was basically another ""Isis saves the day"" novel, with the Doctor playing catchup. Writer wish-fulfillment, maybe?"
3,Baby Mama Drama.,"Baby Mama starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler started off cute and quite funny but fell apart halfway through. For some reason, I just didn't care for Fey in this role, she comes off too serious, and even Steve Martin got on my nerves and I adore him otherwise. Poehler is the only shining moment in the film, she is such a hoot as Angie...a flighty woman who agrees to be a surrogate for Kate (Fey) who is having difficulty getting pregnant. This movie is good for a Saturday night rental but not worth buying. It's a mixed bag for me."
4,Baby Mama,"The acting was very good and there are some parts that are very funny. Some parts may have to be explained to smaller children. But, overall I thought it was a good family movie."
5,Hilarious,"This movie is fantastic. I put it up there with Horrible Bosses and Bridesmaids. I really like Amy Poehlers humor, so most of what she says and does makes me laugh.I like goofy movies like Ace Ventura, classic comedies like Some Like It Hot or Hello Dolly! and sarcastic/ridiculous-situation humor like this. Give it a chance, you might love it as much as I do."
3,"""Congratulations, Kate. I want to reward you with five minutes of uninterrupted eye contact.""","With the SNL comedy stylings of hilarious Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, Baby Mama falls a little short.Maybe I expected too much before sitting down to the film,(with images in my head of Fey's Mean Girls or Poehler's performance in Blades of Glory) but if what you expect is an Apatow-esque comic romp, Baby Mama isn't quite your film.Kate(Tina Fey) is a hard working, career-driven women with little time for much else in her life, only she can't stop thinking about one thing that is missing, a baby. One big problem, she's single and 37.Of course Kate turns to surrogacy where she encounters Angie(Amy Poehler) a loosey-goosey opposite of Kate herself.When Angie gets in a fight with her foul-tounged boyfriend Carl(Dax Shepard) Kate takes her in, and the 'bonding' commences.It's not a laugh-every-minute, but it's a cute film worth one watch.I personally loved Steve Martin's bossy psycho-babble more then much else."
3,Three Stars Only,"I expected so much from this movie. The commercials made it seem funny. However, many parts were just stupid to say the least. I think that if you are interested in seeing this movie it is worth renting. However, I would not suggest buying this movie until you have rented it. Review it first buy it later if you like it. I give it three stars because I laugh at some parts."
3,Just not funny enough,"Any film with the Fey/Peohler mix -- the combo has the wit, timing and symbiotic comic genuis of Lucille Ball (Lucy) and Vivian Vance (Ethel)-- should be a winner. I write with great disappointment that Baby Mama, written and directed by Michael McCullers (The spy who shagged me) does nothing to take advantage of this dynamo duo.The script co-opted mainstream Hollywoods's version of humor and dulled down most opportunites for belly shaking laughter. Amy Peohler's character loses her quirky charm early on in the film, and Tina Fey's character begins to take herself way too seriously.Perhaps the film wanted to send messages: what is friendship, what is loyalty, and forgot that it was supposed to be a comedy.It's not that the movie wasn't cute (it is) or sweet (it is), but it just does not hit the mark."
2,please try again,"tina fey and amy pohler are both very funny but this weak film does not due justice to their comedy chops. its light and at times just odd, i really question the decisions made by writer/director michael mccullers. very disappointing."
4,Baby Mama,"When you need a simple comedy to lighten the day, this film does it. Light and cheery with a few predicatable twists. Great performances by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler with a few other well known actors/actresses. A surprise hit for the night."
3,Baby Mama DVD,"Baby Mama is a good gift for a teenager..funny, entertaining and will be viewed over and over..."
4,Fey and Poehler Terrific,"I would describe ""Baby Mama"" as a light-hearted comedy as opposed to a lightweight one. The difference between the former and the latter is that the script is intelligently written but it's not going to break any comedic ground. The main reason to see the film is the impeccable chemistry between stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. I think one print reviewer compared them to a latter day Lucy and Ethel. Pretty sad when you have to go back over fifty years for an analogy. Sorry, Laverne and Shirley. As a lifelong resident of Philly I loved the knowing local references probably because Tina's from Upper Darby which is practically Philadelphia. My favorite was Amy feigning morning sickness by barfing up a box of Tasty Kakes. I don't want to damn the film with faint praise but you could do worse. You definitely can."
2,Should have been funnier.,"Far from being ""hilarious"" as some misguided reviewers have stated, this film has a few mildly amusing moments and little else. The script was not as sharp as it should have been - the ""jokes"" seemed flat and lackluster. Steve Martin and Sigourney Weaver were not particularly funny either. The two female leads tried valiantly to salvage this material but didn't quite succeed. Overall, not a total waste of time but pretty darn close."
3,Moderately entertaining,"I really enjoy Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Tina is incredible in 30 Rock, and Amy is one of the funnier cast members of Saturday Night Live. Still, I wasn't expecting much because the commercials seemed more crude than funny. I found that it was better than I thought it would be, however not really by much.I was disappointed in the humor of this movie. I did expect more laughs than I got, especially considering the comedic ability of Tina and Amy. There really weren't many laughs. On the other hand, there was more real drama than we expected, but only enough to kind of hold our attention. I did enjoy Greg Kinnear and the fantastic Steve Martin, though there roles were relatively small.While I was just barely entertained enough to watch it to the end, this is not a movie that I would watch again."
4,"FEY AND POEHLER, HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG","Granted this isn't Citizen Cane, but for what it is, it really works. Fey and Poehler have frentic chemistry, and Poehler can make you laugh with just a glance. The supporting cast is sort of waisted, especially Steve Martin, but frankly, this is Fey and Poehler's vehicle to drive and they drive it like a Ferrari. There are several scenes that will make you laugh until it hurts, and the story itself works because Fey and Poehler are so likeable and you go with it, so to speak. The fact that Poehler is actually a little old to be playing this part, makes it all the more funny. If you are a fan of these two, then I can't imagine you not loving the movie, or if your just wanting a movie that will make you laugh. At times some of the gags go wanting, but when it scores it knocks it out of the park."
3,Expected Better,"Considering the cast, I expected to laugh a lot more than I did. Entertaining, but not one I would watch again."
2,missed opportunity,"Amy Poehler and Tina Fey together sound like a marriage made in comedy heaven but after watching this movie you feel just a little let down. Tina Fey could be the next big thing. She is just so watchable and funny in 30 Rock and maybe if she had more input in this movie it could have been a blast,it just felt the main leads were pulling punches.Steve Martin looked old and comatose and Greg Kinnear underutilised. The movie just felt too predictable and not comfortable in its skin."
3,cute,"Watched the movie on a transatlantic flight to Paris, and laughed out loud almost the whole time. Had to buy it to share with my friends, but it lost its fizz already at a second viewing, and just became a so-so movie...Quel dommage."
3,Middle,"I missed this one in the theater, so I was excited to rent it on the day it was released. I enjoyed the film, but not to the extent that I thought I would. With such a talented cast of comedic actors, I was really hoping for more laughs. There are a few good ones, but mostly it is just a mildly amusing movie that gets by with terrific actors doing the best they can with a so so script. The story is fairly standard with a late 30 something career woman wanting to have a baby, but doesn't have a man and finds that she can't conceive herself. In comes Amy as a white trash redneck type that is willing to have the baby for her. The plot brings in an even bigger redneck boyfriend and some shady dealings, and a nice guy for Tina. I want to like this more than I do, but I think a rental is good enough for this movie."
2,"Nice try, could have been much better.","I wouldn't say I terribly enjoyed this movie. At some point, I was going to stop watching it, but I wanted to see the ending, which was pretty predictable for me. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are talented actresses, but were very week in this movie. I only blame the director, who is normally in charge in getting the best out of the main characters. Also the post production have a quite few flaws in editing, by not removing extra frames, right after the director calls ""Action"". Steve Martin was a total waste, the producers could have saved some money by hiring someone new, who is starting his career. Some scenes are missing in the script, like for example a romantic and the same time funny episodes in bed, between Greg Kinnear and Tina Fey, where Greg is reaching for a protection and Fey reveals that no need to do so, since she can not get pregnant. It was a nice change to switch from action movies, (90% new releases today) to a comedy, that I miss so much."
3,A Good Laugh,"I work at Blockbuster Video so I see all the new releases before they come out. I just recently watched this one and I feel that it didn't waste an hour and a half or so of my life.I felt Baby Mama was an enjoyable movie. I would never put it on my top ten list, but it had truly comedic moments. The acting was good, and the characters were memorable.When asked by customers at work, I will recommend this movie. You won't feel like you've wasted $4.88(That's the cost of a NR right now) of your hard earned money. I wouldn't buy this movie to put into my collection though."
2,"Oh, Tina, NO!!","Bad movie, BAD MOVIE!! I love Tina Fey, and I rarely miss 30 Rock...but this was horribly painful to watch! Predictable, I guessed most of it about 5 minutes into the film...Bad, bad, bad...:( I gave it 2 stars, one for Tina and one for Amy...sorry, ladies...this was just awful."
1,Terrible,I love these two but this is absolutely awful. Acting is flat and jokes are obvious. Unfunny.
1,Rip Off!!!!!!!!!!,"Beware!!!!!!! The money grubbing scum who produced the movie have put some kind of copy protection on the disc which makes it unplayable on Media Center PCs with Blu-Ray disc players. I returned it and got my money back, but I'm just trying to save you the trouble of having to do the same."
3,"Easy comedy, good rental option.","The movie is pretty easy going. It has it's couple laughs and funny little phrases, but I probably wouldn't watch it again. I'm a fan of stupid comedy, as well as smart comedy, but this movie played it too safe for my liking. It's not a bad movie, but I would really categorize it as a Rental, not a DVD buying movie."
2,You can figure out the entire plot after the first ten minutes,"I like Tina Fey quite a bit but this movie was pretty disappointing. You can pretty much figure out the entire plot after the first few minutes. No surprises or twists. Lots of the jokes fall flat and too many rely on cheap gimmicks (such as a Lamaz coach who talks like Elmer Fudd). Also, although the movie seems like its about empowerment, strong women, etc. The ultimate message is still that for women to be happy they need to find the right guy and have babies."
3,Baby Mama,"I never saw the film before, but when it came out on DVD I wanted to buy it, because I love these girls from SNL, and I thougt that was a guaranty to purchase this film, so after I wached, I realized that it's not that good, it's just ok. I regret in some way that I purchazed."
3,Old style bowling.,"This is another one of the cheap nes sport games. But it is still fun. The graphics r not very good for the nes. It is one of those blocky games that the ball does not even go straight, it moves at one frame at a time. U can chose between four people, what type of ball, and how fast u throw it and how much u curve it. It can really be four player if u switch back and fourth between people. After a while it gets boring so i like it better on multiplayer."
1,Wedding 6/21/09,The sandles did not work out in the sand (letters did not show up) :0( but I guess I can still just wear them as sandles!
4,Great flip flops for a bride to be going on a Carribean honeymoon!,These flip flops were a great shower gift for my best friend who is going on a Carribean cruise for her honeymoon! They were the hit of the bridal shower! I paired the flip flops along with shipboard credit on the cruise ship that the bride and groom will be honeymooning on.
1,Waste of money,"Don't buy!!! Both sandals were different sizes and the straps were to loss. Terribly made. Cheap!! Would return but don't want to waste any more money on these cheap, disappointing sandals. I was so excited about them and I was just totally disappointed."
5,WITH THIS PRESERVE YOUR GAME AND SYSTEM,WITH THE CLEANING KIT YOU CAN PRESERVE YOUR GAMES AND SYSTEM FOR MANY YEARS YOU SHOULD CLEAN YOUR SYSTEM MONTHLY AND YOUR GAMES EVERY TIME YOU USE THEM
3,This cleaning kit works VERY well,"This cleaning kit works very well. You push the cleaner in the NES, & move it back & forth. I wish I had known that the kit should come with cleaning pads (I'm guessing for the game cartridges.)"
3,"Fits, but...","it is a little less snug than the original Canon covers. It doesn't turn as far to latch, so it has a tendency to twist back and fall off."
3,"Product is simple enough to work fine, but I am not pleased with the seller","I ordered lens caps and body caps for my camera, but when I received my order there were only lens caps. The package was labeled for the body cap, but the contents were a lens cap.I called customer service, and while they weren't the worst I've dealt with, they were far from the best. They refunded the purchase price of the cap, but not the delivery, and told me I had to order the correct product on Amazon again. I chose not to take the chance again.On the other hand, the rear lens cap worked fine. But being a simple piece of plastic, there are no surprises there."
4,fits well...,Umm what more can i really say. It does it's job. I just wish they weren't so ez to loose.
5,SUPER!,"I have read this book cover to cover and find that it is just the definitive book to read about chakras. After practising some of the techniques and working with the chakras as the author suggests, I have had success with realizing life problems and past life problems that were holding me back. It's a great book, and everyone should read it."
5,Awesome CD - Completely worth the $. Great musician,"John Mayer is a great musician, and he really proves it on this cd. Its a mix of styles like: Simon and Garfunkel and Fleetwood Mac to Stevie Ray Vaughn and Booker T."
5,I feel differently than Are you kidding?,"I don't own this recording yet, so I will buy this edition. I can appreciate if I owned a prior edition of Continuum I wouldn't want to purchase it again.I think John Mayer is a great talent and has been the future of rock and blues ever since he began.I love Waiting on the World to Change. I heard him play this at Live Earth USA.Peace,Edje"
5,Great New Music,Great Album it's good to hear music that crosses generational lines and draws Father Daughter and all to tune into the best things in life. Thanks to John for not being idle while waiting.
5,A Pop/Blues Fusion Masterpiece,"'Continuum' did not hook me on a first listen as 'Room for Squares' or 'Heavier Things' did. These albums are instantly catchy and can be listened to over and over, and they each define for me periods of my life, as I believe they will yours. However, after owning both these albums, I obviously also had to buy 'Continuum' and I do not regret it. While I believe it needs the background of the latter albums to put it into John Mayers context, it is also stand-alone fantastic, and after a few listens i slowly became hooked to every song. The music is more sophisticated, richer and a masterpiece of pop/blues fusion that will appeal greatly to fans of either genre and may even act as bridge for listeners between the two!"
5,"""I wish I knew hot to quit you.""","This guy is just so musically gifted.I rarely like all songs on an album, but this one is just an exception. From the first track, to the last one.I really wish there were more songs, but at the same time i really feel more than satisfied with this album... ironic.Instead of reading explanations as to why its great, just go buy the album and listen.This album definitely has what it takes to transcend generations.Definitely worth more than 5 stars.Classic!"
5,A surprise,"I have seen John Mayer live three times over the last several years. Not because i am a fan, but because my daughter (now 18)thinks he is ""so cute"". The live shows were better than the CD's I had to listen to on the way to the concert, but I never became a fan.. I bought Continuum for my daughter and played it on the way home. I was extremely surprised. This is a great R&B flavored album (reminiscent of Sam cooke and Marvin Gaye). Mailed my daughter her copy, and went back and bought one for myself. May have to go see John in concert again."
2,Can't listen to it any longer!,"I respected his deep articulate approach to music, I thought he was an artist who had a profound sense of self-awareness; genuine and authentic, someone with a ""real' & ""original"" touch. But then i play his music at this somewhat intellectual gathering then one guest says,""who's that? John Mayer? Yeah that's the guy going out with that Simpson bimbo!"". People cracked jokes,laughed, yet I was in shock, I couldn't believe it, for me he's this special underground artist who supposedly evolved from his old music and got recognised for his talent in his latest album, however, not anymore, I am sorry, I can't feel his lyrics and music the way I use to, I have a different perception of him as an artist. He's typically shallow, common and fame-struck. I am doubting his musical abilities now. He probably has many creative people working for him like the rest of those ""big"" artists."
1,BORING!,"If you truly like JM and understand just how unique his previous projects were, you will NOT like the latest. Maturity... No! Boring... yes! No longer a unique sound.All I have to say... Who cares?"
5,Very surprised,"I bought this CD because I like the main song on the radio and the DJ was gushing over how much she liked it. I usually expect to only really like a couple of songs on a CD - so have really stopped purchasing very many - i.e. iTunes. But I was pleasantly surprised, the music is good all the way through, some really great words, and a good mix of softer tunes with very upbeat stuff."
2,disappointed,"well I thought that when John did his last album that he had finally gotten past the ""pretty boy, where's the girls"" faze. From what I've seen of the favorable reviews of this cd, he still draws a very young crowd eventho many of his blues admirers are heavily based in the Clapton generation. I bought it...gave it 3 times with an open mind,then gave it away. He is a rockin blues guitarist & I have always admired his pick of mentors. He's wasting his talents on the commercial radio money gigs. Go back to the 3 piece band & rock on Mr. Mayer."
3,Nooo Johnnny Boyyy,"I'm still waiting for Johns old guitar skills to come back, with some killer blues riffs or something. The only song that I loved on this CD was Bold as Love, and that was one of Hendrix's'... =("
2,The usual radio-oriented poppy stuff,"I recently read an article in Rolling Stone about how great a guitar player John Mayer is. In the magazine he was placed side by side with John Frusciante and Derek Trucks. Being a guitar fan I decided to give him a shot and bought this album.I just could not get through all the songs. Man is this boring.Maybe he is a good guitar player but the overly (and I mean OVERLY) mellow tunes just obscured everything else. I won't mention the fact that Rolling Stone made references to Stevie Ray Vaughn, John Mayer is nowhere in SRV's scale. I guess I'll just stick to the original.Sorry John, maybe next time."
5,He just keeps getting better,"Each CD is just a bit more original, and this one is amazing. If you like Mayer, check out the Austin band Vallejo, their Thicker Than Water CD is a mix of Mayer and Los Lonely Boys.....really amazing CD."
5,"John Mayer's new cd ""continuum""","This cd is fabulous. It is rare to purchase a cd and like every song on it. This one is just that good, and I was never a John Mayer fan before. I didn't hear his music until the radio played Change the World so much that I asked someone who is this? I am a new fan. The lyrics are brilliant.Stephanie in Virginia"
4,Old people like Mayer too.,"I am an old guy. 55 years old, love good guitar/vocal/lyrics. John seeme to have captured the magic in music that made you want to go out and purchse the album, bring it back home and spin it countless times. Very good music. Everything falls into place."
5,I give it 10 stars,"Really great. Some wonderful reviews here have already said most of how I feel about this album. One of 2006 top 10 albums. Mayer not only shows him growth as a musician, he actually excels in this album. The best one from Mayber so far. Impressive, impressive, impressive. And refreshed my love for blues music again."
3,Sorry Johnnie - didn't do it for me,"I was disappointed in this CD - Mayer seems to sing depressing after depressing song. I am a big fan of his, but not this CD."
3,Johnny Lost His Edge,"John Mayer is a significantly talented guitar player, and I can remember a quote of him saying something like ""I didn't realize how much I liked playing the blues until I played the Crossroads tour with Eric Clapton."" Which he did after his first 2 studio albums. He was already held in high respect by the guitar community, but looked at as a ""pop"" musician. Then he proceeded to put all doubters to rest with ""Who Did You Think I Was"" and the live album Try!.That said, being a guitar player, and someone who really liked the album Try!, I was terribly let down by Continuum. I was expecting slashing guitar solos like Stevie Ray Vaughan, with the perfection and soul of Clapton...I'm pretty sure it wasn't just me, now I'm just thinking who did you think I was?"
3,not clear on the actual cover of the album.,i was lead to believe that the gray continuum cover was the vinyl cover but its actually a plain white album.
4,"Great songwriting, and he idolizes Jimi Hendrix","A few relationship songs, sure...but great songwriting and virtuoso guitar playing. This disc grows on you fast. You will be surprised."
5,Love it.,I would say this is one of his best albums but I would be saying that about all of his albums. I play guitar and have the tab book for this album and it is just amazing to play. I have not taken this album out of my car in a long time. He is truly a talented artist despite what he has been going through in the media the past few years.
5,Satisfied,"I was sitting up late Saturday night and turned it to Soundstage already in progress. I saw Buddy Guy on stage playing with this young guy I had never seen. I became enthralled with the performances but I never caught his name. So afterwards I looked up the Soundstage tv schedule and found out it was John Mayer. Did some further checking and found out about his turn toward the blues, and I love blues. Took a chance and bought the cd next day. Best music I've bought in a long time. No, it's not straight blues. But it's definitely honest. And in this day and time of kitsch glorification, I'll take it. I feel like my money was well spent. Can't say that for a whole lot of things I've bought."
4,continuum,"I was introduced to the genius of John on his Room For Squares album and I have been hooked ever since. Although Continuum is not my favorite of his, it certainly demand full attention when played. I gave it to my cousin after I treated her to a John Mayer concert for the first time. She bought the Continuum CD and plays it constantly in her husbands waiting room dentists' office. Thanks John for giving us such pleasure!!"
5,Simply Amazing,"I can honestly say that this cd has been playing in my car for the last two weeks straight -- again and again. People -- it is that good. All the tracks are unbelievable and John's voice is pure gold. I love ""The Heart of Life"" and ""Stop this Train"" -- the lyrics are meaningful and you know that when he wrote them -- he had been there experiencing it.He is here in Atlanta for 2 sold-out shows this weekend and sadly I didn't get tickets in time, but for those who did -- it is surely going to be an experience.Buy this album !!!"
4,Sophistication and Maturiy Shine in this Album,"Unlike his prior albums, which had a bit of a ""pop"" twist... this album has a different feel. You get a real sense of soul, sophistication, maturity... even warmth, as if the artist was inviting you into that moment of his thoughts. Like most albums, there are some better songs vs. others... I adore tracks #1, #10 and #12.I guess if you want a gauge of what my taste is like... and whether it matches your preferences, the album I'm currently loving is: Joshua Radin and the albums I still love are James Taylor, Chantal Kreviasuk and Cat Stevens."
5,WOW!!!!!!!,"by far John's greatest work. I feel like he is going to be here for awhile, he is the real deal. He is improving with every song, every cd. He is on his way to greatness!"
4,Good,Let's face it: John Mayer is just cool. Old school cool. Though Heavier Things is still by favorite CD by him Continuum is still a gold standard that most artist can only dream of. Waiting for the world to change is my far the strongest song not only lyrically but commerically while Bold as love did absolutely nothing for me. Still this a good mellow CD by an artistic that blur the color lines.
3,a little too easy...,"I found the first two albums interesting- full of great chord changes. His second one, while a little less accessible to many showed him stretching his songwriting and sonic chops some more. John is a great guitar player and was showing signs of becoming an even stronger songwriter until this album, which is hopefully just a slump. Most of the tracks are just too predictable. One track has almost identical chords to 'Sexual Healing.' Although the hooks are catchy they are more like commercial jingle hooks; when I heard the first single off the album I expected a voice-over to start up and try to sell me some cholesterol medication. The production on the album, like his others, is very high-end. I guess I can appreciate Mayer's desire to show off his bluesy side, i.e. that he can really play the guitar, but I hope to see him get back to exploring some more interesting things on the next release."
2,Continuum doesn't continue anything,"Boring piece of work by John Mayer. I think he's trying to ""update"" his style, but I could only find 2 songs on the album that could interest me at all. I feel he is looking for some new direction, but hasn't found it!"
3,I expected better,"I'm a huge John Mayer fan, but I wasn't too thrilled with this CD. I just received it and have listened to it a couple times....perhaps it will grow on me but my initial response was....boring! It didn't move me at all."
4,wonderful addition to your cd collection,"This cd took some getting used to- not the ""usual"" John Mayer. ""stop this train"" (not sure if exact title of song) is my favorite. Chances are you won't be disappointed. Would have rated this 4 1/2 stars if I could've .""Any Given Thursday"" cd is an awesome live cd-check it out."
5,Fantastic Album,"This is one of those albums an artist puts out and you wonder how they'll ever top it.Not ONE bad song on this bad boy!My favorite is ""Gravity""!peace!"
4,Best Effort to Date,"Admittedly, I was not a huge John Mayer fan until I saw him live in concert.This is far and away Mayer's best album to date, a great blending of his love of the blues and intricate guitar work and his ability to make those two qualities radio-friendly.Mayer is slowly but surely shedding his ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" and ""Daughters"" pop-blues writing and entering into a bluesier phase that will hopefully continue into his next album(s).Check out his briliant Hendrix cover, Bold as Love, though nearly every song on this album is of single quality."
5,Slow Burning Beauty,"""Slow Dancing In A burning Room""...Priceless.From the very first note my heartstrings were pulled.One must hear it being sung by John (L.A.)to get the full affect behind every note... Not Since Barry White's ""Whatever We Had, We Had"", The Temptations' ""Memories"" or even Enya's ""Evening Falls"",have I felt such an embrace of the bittersweet taste of love and the joy of being alive to experience such human musical brilliance. Savor it...don't swollow just yet... As Barry put it, ""...such sweet sorrow""Thank you John Mayer. Your gift has made room for you and the rest of the world to enjoy. Priceless."
4,"Stylish, well balanced guitar and vocal","John Mayer's guitar and vocals both are stylish, smooth, understated, controlled and hugely appealing. Mayer is among the best working today."
5,continuum,bought for my sister who raves about it. She really likes John Mayer This album is her favorite shipping and packaging was perfect and quick
3,Good album,"I bought this mostly for the song ""Gravity"". But on further listening the rest of the record isn't bad either. Also has the hit song ""Waiting for the world to change"". If that means anything to you. Mayer is an under-rated blues guitarists and victim of his own bad publicity stunts but that shouldn't stop you from listening to this album."
3,It's a good CD,"It's one of those CDs, you can pop in the player and just listen to without skipping any tracks. But my favorite track is ""Gravity"""
5,Love it John never disappoints!,"Other than his recent foray into pop culture aka dating Jessica Simpson, John has always been an artist that has inspired my respect. This CD does not disappoint. From start to finish you have the smooth silky smoky vocals and the bluesy twang of a steel guitar. Beautiful, sexy, relaxing jazzy vibe. I love this CD for resting and laying around on a rainy afternoon or cleaning the house and singing along as I go about my day. Even my husband who is anti most of the music I like has been caught singing along. My three kids all love this one too and my teen will be accompanying me to see him on this tour this summer. Kudos to Mr.Mayer hopefully his musical taste continues to be better than his dating sense or perhaps Jessica has more depth than appears on the surface. But hey who can blame him? Besides, this is a review of music which is excellent and not his dating life right? Get the CD if you are a Mayer fan or even sitting on the fence you will love it."
5,Very Happy,"I am shocked. I did not like the first album. Sounded too Dave Matthews. The last album was average. But this album is great. John Mayer finally decided that he can be what he wants to be, and did a blues album for the masses. It is great. Love Believe, Gravity, and Vultures.Great pickup here."
4,John Mayer,"John's last album was fabulous, which is always hard for a new artist to keep up on ""greatness"". This is a solidly good album and worth buying and listening to. Each time you listen to a John Mayer song you like it more than the last time as you grow to understand the words and intent."
4,He just can't miss,"Ok I must say I was turned on to John by someone who I thought had no idea what good music was, but I must say, after I heard what he was doing...I'm sold.This CD is more of the same old good stuff he is known for. I have everything he put out, and I can not tell you when this guy ever feels off. Because it sounds like on this CD, he pushed it up. I MUST HAVE!!!"
1,Continuum of crap,John mayer sucks....this long haired image he's trying to pull of now with this sissy pop princess guitar playing is embrassing. Hit the road square.
1,if i could give a 0,"i don't like John Mayer. And I'm being nice. please. overrated hype bull**** music. I don't even see a comparison to the richness of so many other musicians in this genre. His genre is produced pop DO NOT think for yourself creativity. Funny thing, people buy it. So much for the American music scene, as shallow as our culture allows."
1,Nobody's Hero,Well Mr. Mayer believes that we should all put down our GH controllers and be like him. But who wants to be a loser?
2,Waiting On The Song To Change,"What a boring and uninspired effort. There is no energy behind these songs and they are pretty cut and dry. This is cookier cutter wannabe blues. I honestly believe John Mayer has some talent, but very little is show on this CD. ""Vultures"" is my favorite song and I decided to buy it after hearing that, going against my better judgement. I knew I would regret it, and I certainly do! If you're having trouble sleeping, throw in this CD and dream your life away."
1,This CD was a major disappointment from a great artist!!!,"John Mayers first two cd's, were great, some of the best music I've heard in a very long time. This CD was awful. John, you're not an R&B; singer like Al Green, Sam Cook, etc. Stick to the rock/pop. It's alright to have a touch of R&B;/Blues, but stick to what you do best.With the exception of track #6, this album was a total waste of money. Buy it used!!"
5,Love it,I love this album. Gravity is my favorite son. His concert on DirectTV made me run to purchase the cd and every single song is great. Why didn't he win Record of the Year at the Grammy's?
5,A great CD,I love this CD. Every song is unique and never boring. It is great to listen to after a long stressful day because it helps you unwind.
5,I'm A Convert,I love this CD. My first John Mayer but I find myself playing it over and over. This is a keeper. Every song is beautiful.
5,All around great album,"This cd has anything I could want. It has very mellow songs and upbeat songs. John Mayer actually covers Jimi Hendrix. You can't ask for much more than that. There is a lot more guitar work than his previous albums. It is definitely more mature than his other work. The only song I'm not a huge fan of is 'in repair', but it's only one song. I love the rest of the album."
5,"Not a kid, just a John Mayer fan","This album is simply the mix of his newly discovered blues roots with the pop sensibilities of his first album, and to a lesser extent his second. This album is just a really good solid blues-rock rootsy album. I won't elaborate too intensely as others will take up this task, but this is a really rock solid album and those who diss it... I dunno I hate all kinds of music and have given lots of negative review, but this album just sounds very high quality to me."
3,crossroads,"Listen to the way he plays guitar, he plays very well. I like the song, ""your body is a wonderland"" and ""why gerorgia"" but here is the thing. He could be a country act, and I love country music. While I am writing this, I have cross canadian ragweed playing. But, I am not going to deny John Mayer or his music on account of the fact that I have not heard much of his songs. ""heart of life"", really good song. If you like this, check out the Cmt crossroads where he was with Brad Paisley (a very young and talented country singer). Check out some Brad Paisley. You will not be dissapointed. From what I have heard of this album, continum, I will get it very soon."
1,I normally don't write bad reviews...,"but this CD was horrible. I only listened to it once all the way through, so maybe it's one of those CDs that you have to get used to. Either way, I couldn't even imagine spending the time to listen to it again.With how popular he is, maybe my expectations were too high. The lyrics are pretty ordinary, and his singing is annoying since it's the same on most every song. I was also disappointed with the guitar work, as I really appreciate a talented guitarist and was looking forward to discovering another great musician to listen to. Mayer is definitely overrated in this category.As I said, I usually don't write negative reviews, but I wanted to warn others who are thinking about Mayer as being anything notable. Maybe it's this album only, as some other reviewers have suggested."
1,Boring...and too many versions of one cd.,"First of all, this is a painfully boring cd. I love his first 2 cds and listen to them all the time but this one is just not all that great. When I saw this album online, it lists ""Say"" as the last song. My wife bought me the 2 cd set but it didn't have Say on it so I returned it to the store and traded for the cd with the darker cover. It didn't list Say either but I thought maybe it was a hidden track. Well, it's not on there. Why is ""Say"" listed as one of the songs on the cd when you research it on Amazon, Best Buy, or even JM's website but when you buy the cd, ""Say"" isn't on it? Are there in fact THREE versions of this crappy cd?"
1,As dull and flavorless as music gets,"zzzzzzzzzzz...zzzzzzzzzz....zzzzzzzzz....oh, ahem, excuse me.This album put me to sleep because it is so boring. The album opens with a cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"", which in the middle, breaks to an instrumental of ""What's Going On"". As for the rest? BO-RING. This is as cookie-cutter and sterile as adult contemporary music gets. Where's the justification for all the acclaim? I certainly don't hear it. Musicianship? Nothing noteworthy, just by-the-numbers work that sounds like the product of non-creative session men / women. This is the kind of music people brainlessly clap their hands to in a pathetic attempt to ""feel"" it. It's also the kind of album fans of it will look back on in 10 years and ask of themselves: ""I liked THAT? Maybe I can sell it for 10 cents during a yard sale""."
1,Thanks for nothing...,"First of all, I should mention that I don't actually have this album, but instead I went out and bought the original release the day that it came out. Now here's a re-release to include the song ""Say"". So, I say, way to go to John Mayer, for being one of those artists who irritates fans by pulling stunts like this. Perhaps if it is released on another album with new material I would buy it. Anyway, about the rest of the album, it's okay, but I think ""room for squares"" and ""heavier things"" stayed in my cd player a lot longer than this one."
1,Are you kidding?,"I love John Mayer's work, but are you kidding me? $23 for another copy of Continuum and five of its songs recorded live? Making customers feel exploited at every turn might be one of the things wrong with the recorded music business."
3,jm,This album is a bit of folk and rythm and blues. I think it's okay since this is the first album I have ever listened to from him.
2,not so hot,"this album was full of simplifierd melodies and repitition. its not as good as his othe ralbums. not even close, i still love him, but i think he should have put more into this album"
5,Songwriting is not a crime.,He's amazing. I have been listening to John since early 01 and every album just gets better. See him live if you can. I was lucky enough to get to do that last Sunday. Worth every penny. Worth double what I paid in fact. This is his most mature album and I LOVE the fact that he has gone back to his love of the blues. Slow Dancing In A Burning Room is on permanent rotation for me.
5,Continuum/John Mayer,"Love it! This is one of his best CD's a great mix of good songs and guitar playing. Buy it, you won't be disapointed."
4,Love it,I'd give it 4 and a half if they'd let me. I have to hold back half a star for Waiting on the World to Change. Just not my favorite song.
2,Definently not Heavier Things pt 2,"I don't know what it is but I just can't get into this cd. I could only find 2 standout tracks, and that doesn't say much."
2,John Mayer,A bit disappointed with this album with only about 3 songs I really like. My expectations were a bit high on this one based on his past releases and on live performances.
2,overproduced,"If you like overproduced pieces of junk, this is the album for you. I absolutely loved the song ""Gravity"" was one of the best guitar solos I ever heard and had alot of soul.The version on this cd for some reason sounded like a 5 year old directed it. The guitar solo is painful and nothing like the original version that I heard which I am assuming is a live version. I don't know what happened, I am really just sad.Alot of great songs that I am sure sounds awesome when he puts HIS creative genious in it, he needs a new record lable bad so he can stop selling out."
1,Misleading,I bought this to frame and hang up in my dorm thinking it was the original cover. Well I was wrong. It is a pure white cover. Literally nothing on the front and I plan on returning it because it seems to silly to hang up a white square on a white wall. Very misleading.
5,One of 2006's best albums!,"Nelly Furtado may have been 2006's best new album but singer-songwriter John Mayer comes in 2nd with his album ""Continuum."" I love the hit single ""Waiting On The World To Change"" which should have been a bigger hit. At least he is having sucess with his hit single ""Say."" While he may be known right now for dating actress Jennifer Aniston, we often forget that he is a musician first. In this album Mayer gets right aside other artists and bands like Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews. This is a fun, laid-back listen. The single ""Gravity"" will have you singing along just like ""Waiting On The World To Change."" Every song is worth listening. John Mayer could be hailed as the best male singer right now (Sorry, Justin Timberlake!). Overall I would definately reccomend his most recent album ""Continuum."" I can't wait for another album from him!"
4,A beacon in fog-filled musical world,"While Mayer's first recording was definately in the ""pop"" category, this third release after the bluesy ""Try"" is much more difficult to pigeon-hole. There are some really great tunes on this one and it would be hard for me to choose a favorite. The blues show their face once again as our poor hero falls in and out of love. The really good news is John's talented guitar playing shines like a beacon in fog-filled musical world littered with so many ""three chord Johnnies"" out there. After this disc first came out, I caught some of the songs being used in the background of popular TV shows. I remember hearing Gravity on an episode of House and I think they also used Slow Dancing In A Burning Room as well. Both solid songs from Mr. Mayer. If you have not heard this disc, trust me and buy it for some superb rocking blues guitar work."
4,Influenced by ...,"Although most of the CD isn't exactly my taste, ""Waiting on the World to Change"" is a beautiful anthem - it sounds like 2/3 Van Morrison and 1/3 Curtis Mayfield. BTW, if you aren't not old enough to remember Curtis Mayfield, give him a listen and I'm sure you'll like it. The strongest influence I hear in most of the other tracks is Al Green, as many sound like his slower ballads."
5,"Most personal album yet........very real, very touching...just amazing.","Probably like most people who have written reveiws on this album, I own all of John Mayer's albums because I absolutely love him as an artist. His lyrics always cut to the heart, and even if it's a lighter song, I can always relate on some level to what he is singing about. This album is no different, and by far my favorite album of his. I can tell he has really matured, as his lyrics seem very personal and deeply emotional. And out of all his albums I would say this is the most ""bluesy"" which is awesome. What I love about him is that he can switch genres of music flawlessly (pop, blues, love songs/ballads) but never lose who he is as a musician and song writer. This album is a must have! If you truly appreciate John Mayer, then you will truly appreciate this very heartfelt and touching album."
5,the Moosewood cookbook I rely on most,"The recipe on the cover is kind of kitschy and ridiculous, but everything else in this cookbook is pure delicious gold. This is the one with the lentil-walnut burgers, the calzones, and the lovingly illustrated instructions for making bread that should make even a complete beginner willing to try! (I used to borrow both Moosewood Cookbooks from my roommate; when we split up I had to buy my own. This was the second one I bought, and by far the more useful!)"
5,great book!,"i'm a professional chef, and this is one of my favorite cookbooks. in response to first revue up there, half of making good food is following a recipe...the other half is cooking it well! don't blame the book of you can't do the second step."
5,Excellent!,"The vegetarian recipes in this wonderful cookbook reflect many different ethnic cooking styles, and use a wide variety of ingredients. The charming illustrations guide you through blintzes, enchiladas, breads, cheesecakes, and more. Yummy!"
2,A cute title but I expected more....,"A fun cookbook to look through but when you start making the recipes, its actually a disappointment, especially considering how many gazillllllion copies have been sold of Ms. Katzen's books. Shows what the right marketing can do. The recipes that I tried were VERY hearty but not in a good way, too much fat and rich ingredients and strange combinations of these ingredients too . The Enchanted Broccoli Forest recipe is just a dish of rice with broccoli stuck into it, nothing special. I gave up after the 3 or 4th recipe. This is NOT one of the best veggie cookbooks out there, in spite of the hype!"
2,There are better vegetarian cookbooks out there,"Of all of my vegetarian cookbooks, this is my least favorite. I have only tried a few of the recipes, and they have turned out with mixed results. Some of the recipes just don't sound appetizing, and most of them take a long time to prepare and cook. The layout of the book looks like a handwritten journal which looks very amateurish and makes it more difficult to read in my opinion. Try a book by Peter Bearden or Deborah Madison instead."
1,Once upon a time...,"Once upon a time, I worshipped this cookbook...then, I moved to San Francisco and became accustomed to the Bay Area cuisine. Mollie Katzen's recipes do not stand up to the refined fresh, wholesome foods that this region of the country has perfected. I am actually quite disappointed in some of my former favorite recipes. They have not withstood the test of time....the flavor combinations are definately off......"
1,An aweful cookbook,I want my money back. This is a horrid cookbook with bad recipes. Many of the ingredients you can't even find and the ones you can make are like something bland and earthy you'd find someone at a Grateful Dead concert selling. I would not make any of these recipes for anyone I liked. This is the only book I've ever thrown away in my life.
5,Spring's Promise,"""Spring's Promise"" contains four short inspirational romance stories. Gloria Brandt's ""E-Love"" combines love and the Internet. ""The Garden Plot"" by Rebecca Germany deals with gardens and relationships. Tracie's Peterson's ""Stormy Weather"" bursts with not only lightening but also with electricity. ""Bride to Be"" by Debra White Smith takes the reader down the aisle with the question of Mr. Right. All four stories take place during the season of Spring. You will not be disappointed with this book. I have read and re-read all stories over and over. All stories embrace Christian faith, love and marriage, but without losing the romance of the stories. If you like this book, you will also enjoy ""Spring's Memory""; it also contains four inspirational romances. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Not good for an Amharic speaker,"This dictionary is good if you want to translate words from English to Amharic. Based on one of the reviews I was under the impression that it was the other way round.It would have been better if there was an Amharic ""transliteration"" of the English words. For instance, an Amharic speaker should be able to look up for a word in Amharic, and that should be translated into English (in the English script) along with the transliteration (in the Amharic script). Basically the Ahmaric speaker should be able to state the English translation even if she/he cannot read English."
4,Fun Mystery,"Tom Austen is back with his crime solving expertise. This time one of his schoolmates has been kidnapped and it's up to him to find him. But when he begins uncovering interesting facts about the Golden Boy Cafe, and then gets kidnapped himself he needs to use his brain to save the both of them.This was a very exciting book. I recommend it to all fans of the mystery genre."
3,Del from Kansas,"Due to the weather in Kansas, I have not completed the installation of this unit. The generator arrived on time and free of damage. I will send in another review when the installation is complete. Purchasing this unit from Amazon was easy and quick and they offered the best price on the net.Thanks"
1,Save Yourself the money and aggravation,"It's far cheaper to go to a hotel in my opinion than to get this up and running. After installation and running gas lines it came to about $7,000.00 for me.After less than a year the unit is rusting. Just called Guardian and you can guess what they told me. They know it's a problem and now make aluminum ones. 1 year only warranty on the exterior product they said.So I now have the pleasure of watching this monstrosity rust to kingdom come over the next few years .....What a waste of money."
1,Poor Qauilty,I purchased this item to save my basement from flooding and give us peace of mind do to my wife and I leaving the country for at least 3 weeks at a time each year to visit her elderly parents. After six years and proper maintenance the back end went at a cost of $22oo.oo to repair. I was told by the technician that this units life expectancy was only 5 to 6 years and to buy a liquid cooled generator they last longer. Who in there right mind would ever purchased this generator knowing it would only last 5 to 6 years. I regret ever buying it.
2,It failed,"I have had this unit since 9/07 and it's been regularly serviced. It's only needed to come on a few times during major power outages. During the last two times in 2011, I have had major damage to electrical equipment in out house while under generator power. The first time, I chalked it up to a possible power surge when the power initially went out or came back on. The second time, the generator actually failed, after about six hours, to deliver voltage to our home. When the power eventually came back on, a bunch of stuff in our house got fried. Turns out my generator's rotor was coming apart, there were copper wire shavings in the bottom of the unit. It's also likely my voltage regulator is also bad. This repair is costing me over $1,500. Of course this is a year after the three year warranty is over. Bad news for me. I would have concerns about the quality of this unit."
1,Lousy Quality,I've had this generator for a little over three years. I have had it regularly serviced (change fluids etc.). It kicked on today and after a few minutes made a loud popping sound. Service technician just confirmed that the unit is shot - a rod went through the wall. Basically I have to get a new generator. Real nice for a $3000+ generator. I would recommend you avoid this brand at all costs. Would give this zero stars if I could.
5,Well-Rounded,"An intensely detailed, well rounded and incredibly researched work that holds something for everyone from political scientists to physical scientists."
5,A remarkable achievement!,"This book may be the best ever written about science and technology for a lay audience. Most authors sacrifice rigor in order to tell such stories, but Richard Rhodes miraculously gets the science right, while weaving a narrative every bit as gripping as the best works of fiction. How he managed to organize the huge volume of material in this wonderful way is truly a remarkable achievement.It's been said by many others: It is no wonder that he won the Pulitzer for this book!--Prof. Tom Lee, Stanford University"
2,BORING,I have read a lot of good books about the making of the bomb...this was not one of them. I can just tell from the writing the author is kind of full of himself.
2,Bomb,"I had to read The Making of the Atomic Bomb for class. It is the longest book I have ever had to read. Excessive length is definitely a turn-off. Not only is Rhode's book too long, but the things that make it sooooo long could totally be deleted and no one would miss them. How is the crabgrass in Mrs. Fermi's front lawn in Leonia, New Jersey of any relevance to the atomic bomb? Same goes for the problem with Robert Oppenheimer's mom's right hand and the French doors at the UC Berkeley lab. Don't get me wrong, though, I got into the book; some parts definitely grabbed my attention, but there was so much superfluous stuff to get through in the meantime. Rhodes should have edited the book down to maybe 350 pages max. It would have been really good then -- compelling,attention-grabbing,and concise. This might be a good book to read if 1)it is mandatory, 2) you are retired or just have a lot of time for sitting around, or 3) you are a friend of Rhodes and he will be offended if you don't."
5,From discovery of electron to history of Quantum Mechanics,When I found out that I had to read a book for the Modern Physics class I was a bit scared. I am a slow reader and cannot read boring books. Since the day I picked up this book I have not been able to put it down. I am a Physics student and now I know the importance of history. I have been able to understand the technicality of Modern Physics so much better now then before. I recommend it to all Physics and science lovers out there.
5,10 STARS! Essential reading,"This book is one of a few essential books on the US nuclear weapons program, and no self-respecting researcher or other interested parties' bookshelf should be with out it.Mr. Rhodes painstakingly took the time to homogenize all of the various journals, threads, facts, and debunked fiction into one master reference of the Manhattan Project. All of the players are here, with their histories. All of the sites, locations, dates, tests, it's all here. And, it's well put. Many, many photgraphs adorn this well, well rounded book. Very easy to read, and simply states uncolored history, no biasing.A wonderful book, and a PERFECT present for the person you love who is interested in weaponeering."
5,Incredible book!,"Considering I was not even very interested in the subject of particle physics or the making of the atomic bomb before I started this book, the writing in this book is so absorbing and the topic developed so well that I could not put it down.Frankly, I was given the book as a gift and started reading it out of boredom. I found it to be the most engaging book I have read in years. This is less a testament to the subject and more a testatment to the author!"
5,A Masterpiece.,"I began reading this book in pieces as I loitered in bookstores. I found myself spending quite some time lost in its pages. At first I expected an exposition on Fatman and Little Boy but what I found was truly worth the funding of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Rhodes gives the most comprehensive treatise of twentieth century nuclear physics that I have found thus far. He also delves deep into the characters so that one begins to know those involved, those who would change the world. One can share the joy of insight, of science, and at the same time the fear of its consequences. The book is inspiring and at the same time horrifically graphic. It brings almost to the taste the results of war. It is quite possibly the finest piece of modern history I have ever read."
5,Greatest account of one of sciences greatests endeavors.,"""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is the most accurate, intriguing, engrossing account of the most important scientifc endeavor in human history. This reads better than any Tom Clancy novel, is at least on par with Homer, and teaches more than any physics text book to anyone that reads it. If only most fiction was as good as this non-fiction. Rhodes' ability to take highly complex and complicated scientific matters and relate them in a way in which in the most scientifically-challenged person can understand an d appreciate is amazing. He should have recieved a Double Pulitzer for his efforts. Even more interesting are the stories about the people involved. This is an incredible history of some of the most gifted, and sometimes troubled, minds in human history. A must for anyone with any interest in science at any level"
3,"Good on Physics and Physists, simplistic on policy","This presents a first rate history of the physics, at the layman's level, and the physicists of the early 20th century. Sadly much of the 2nd half of the book is given over to the political implications and the aftermath of bombing Japan. The first is simplistic and ideological, the second is hackneyed.E.g, Rhodes takes it as revealed wisdom, that the U.S. should have published all the technology developed in the Manhattan project, and thereby avoided the Cold War. There is a (tenuous, to my mind) case to be made for that view, but Rhodes simply puts in the mouths of a couple of physicists as if it requires no further thought. ""Our physicists want to share with the Russians, so we'll just give Stalin the bomb. He's not so bad."""
5,An Impressive Work of Both Research and Writing,"There's not much you can say about this book except that if this is not the greatest nonfiction book of the twentieth century, it is certainly very close.Rhodes' reseach is topnotch as he weaves together the science, politics, and engineering necessary to achieve the completion of a weapon that forever changed history.This is not an easy book to read and it is certainly not a fast read beach book. It's the kind of book in which you read a few paragraphs and then go back and look for something you read earlier in the book for it all to make sense. But, it is a book that is very rewarding if you see it through."
4,"How do you define ""Making""?","It's not what I thought it would be but I'm struggling to come up with a suitable title. ""Fusion - Epiphany to Actuality - The Lead-Up to the Atomic Bomb"" is about the best I can do. It should have stopped at the first critical mass.The actual 'Making' happened after the theory/experimentation, which is this book's primary focus. The actual 'making' was what I was primarily interested in learning about - Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, etc., where the gadget was actually 'made'. Incredibly very short-shrift is given to this despite the length of the book.""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" is remarkable in it's own right. But while we're not supposed to judge a book by its cover I thought we might at least have a reasonable chance at judging the topic by its title. Apparently not."
3,A bit too much,"I love history, math and science, and have a technical advanced degree, but still managed to have a tough time getting through this book. In an attempt to impress us, I get the idea that Rhodes sat down and included every microscopic fact that he could come up. Richard, a bit of advise...sometimes less is more. I really don't care, for example, that Szilard didn't like the bed that was offered him in Bohr's guestroom. Rhodes also wrote in much too much detail about every little physics experiment that ever went in to the eventual development of the bomb. Again, I like science and can handle technical issues, but his discriptions just went on ad nauseum.I do give this three stars because the topic is surely important. I am very interested in WWII history as well. However, I must confess that this was a bit of a letdown."
2,Trim the chaff,"As with many of today's novels this historical account spends far too much time on trivialities. The real meat of the account, the chemistry and physics, the discoveries and engineering, is buried in a never-ending snow of needless unrelated detail that challenges the reader to discern and string along with the previous piece, perhaps a dozen pages before. Don't get me wrong, the history is all there but scanning through the filler for it is no joy."
