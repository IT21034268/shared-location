1,Don't bother with this one!,"We actually received this toy as a gift, but we will be returning it for something our son will actually play with and enjoy. The music is quite annoying on this toy, and I thought it would come on for a bit each time the toy was kicked, but no, it stays on for 5 minutes while my son just lies there looking at it. He watched the lights for a few minutes, but was quickly bored by this toy. A real disappointment for a company like Fisher Price."
1,SHOULD BE RECALLED!!,"I bought this for my son when he was three months old. He could not kick it on. The music drove me nuts. It takes an adult to get the balls back in place. It is not very sturdy. When my son was 7 months old he was standing in front of it and grabbed on to it for support. He pulled it toward him and It fell on top of him. He could not get it off of him. When I pulled it off of him, BLOOD!! It cut his eyelid. Not quite serious enough for stitches but come on this is an infant toy!! I contacted Fisher Price and they had me send it in for inspection. They appologized and sent me my money back. My son now 12 months has a scar. Think twice. If you can pull it over with one finger your baby can too!"
2,The Baby Hates it so much - she rolls away from it!!!,"I asked for this toy for my second child becasue my oldest had a similar kick toy (no longer on the market) that she loved so much, she wore out the motor! Well, this one was such a disappointment. It has little footprints which imply that if you kick there, the music will play, but if you kick it anywhere or simply bump into it, the music starts - this totally defeats the ""cause & effect"" educational value to the toy. The dangling toys are too far away for the baby to reach and do not move easily or do anything when kicked. The baby tires of it and rolls away from it after about three minutes. I was hopeful that it would become worthwhile after I transformed it to a sitting-up toy, but like others have said, it is hard to get the balls and basically just frustrates the baby."
2,my boys still dont play with this toy,"I was so excited when i got this toy i couldnt wait to put it together. Well that took forever and when i was done the boys hated the toy! I had high hopes though thinking they would like it when they were older and we would change the setting, no such luckThe balls are way too hard to get off-When they stop the wheel from spinning it makes a scary noise-They still dont know what to do with the balls-The music goes off whenever the toy gets bumped-Now the toy is being used to hold open the bedroom door......kinda an expensive door stop!"
2,Ok but don't love it,My mom bought this for my 2 1/2 month old. i had to prop her on her boppy to watch it. she did that for all of 5 minuts. my 4 year old has put it in to the toddler position and is playing with the balls and his hotwheels on it. I don't think it is a good toy for baby's under 4 months. I might be bringing it back if I feel like taking it apart.
4,"1st time mom, but aunt to many","We bouht this for our son when he was 3months old and he loved it. He had no prolem with kicking it to make it work. Ours sometime I feel is to easy, like there is time you think it is off and you step on the floor the right way it starts playing. He just turn 6month and he crawels over to it and put the balls on it and even his pacitfier on it to mke then fall of the ramps. All his older cousins like it too."
3,Pretty Good Toy But Not All That,We bought this for my son when he was 3 months old. We saw the ad on TV and thought this would be awesome for our son. He loves to kick and swing those arms. It seemed to be really entertaining and was going to last a little bit longer for toy wise because he can use it when he sits up. Well it took my hubby forever to put to together. It has a lot of screws and stuff to put together. At first it scared my son and so we gave it a rest for a while. We just bought it back out and he seems to like it okay but not that much. For some reason it does not go off like it is suppose to when he kicks it (trust me my son has a powerful kick too)it only goes off once and while. I am not sure if I have a defected one or what. Needless to say we have been very disappointed with the toy and would not reccommend it to any parents. I wish we would have kept the box because we would have taken it back and got him something else. Please don't waste your money on this!!!!
4,Great toy!,"I bought this toy for my son today who is 2 1/2 months old. He absolutly loves it!! I don't know what everyone else is talking about how its hard to turn on and all that. Just with the littlest touch, it turns on. I only had two problems; 1 when putting it together the screws are kind of hard to screw in, 2 my son kicks higher then where he's supposed to kick so to solve this problem I just took a folded receiving blanket and put it underneath the toy to raise it up a little and he kicks it in the right spot now. I'd highly recommend that you buy this toy for your child."
4,Mine is just fine,"I bought this because it looked like something my daughter can use for a long time. Yes, it is hard for her to kick it and get it to work (she is 1 month old). But you barely touch the blue legs and it comes right on! I just angled her, so her arm will hit the blue leg and she activates it just fine. I do agree the ages on this needs to start at 3months or so - but we are using it and she seems to enjoy it. I just lay on the floor with her and play with her and move her so she can see what is happening. I do look forward to when she can do all of it herself and entertain herself - but that can't realistically be expected for a few more months."
1,waste of time,"We put our 10 week old boy in it and he hated it. He loves all the other toys he has that play music and move. He could not reach the toys with his hands and when he kicked them they were to hard. When we put him close enough to reach the toys his legs kicked to high or he would kick it away. We tried to put it against something, but he still was not interested. I would not recommend this toy to anyone."
4,It is not as bad as everyone says,I got this as a baby shower gift and let me tell you it keeps both my 6 month old and 3 year old entertained(my 6 month old has been using it since he was only like 3 months). Kids are not suppose to be entertained with toys longer than 20 to 30 min. anyways so anyone looking for something to entertain them for longer than that they are not going to find. Yes this toy is loud but these types of baby toys(all baby toys in general) are suppose to be loud and comfortable anyways so I see no problems with that. This toy I saw no more problems than any other toy gym or whatever anyone wants to call this. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS TOY TO ANYONE!!!!!
3,OK toy with bouncer seat,"We got this toy as a gift at our baby shower, our son never liked to lay under this to play. We had the same problem with the toys hanging to high to reach and he would kick the bottom and move the toy away from him. Also, the little balls that circle around are up to high and not position right over his head so again never would keep his attention.however, we did find that he would play with this if he sat in his (baby papasan vibrate seat) The seat sits perfect to where this toy just slides around the front of the chair. He could then use his feet to kick at the hanging toys and he could see the lights and balls go around better.so if you already have this toy and are having problems with baby using it try what we did if you have a bouncer seat and if you have yet to purchase this keep looking or make sure you have a bouncer seat so that baby can sit in front of and enjoy.hope this helps someone!"
2,Full but falls over easy,"I agree with the previous reviewers with the added comment that my 8 month old son pulls up on everything including this toy; however, the toy is not sturdy enough and falls over. I put weights on the legs to try and keep it from falling, but it still falls over. I would strongly suggest you save your money and purchase something baby can pull up on. I wish I had taken that into account before buying. One positive thing I will say is that my son does love this toy."
1,mother of 2,"Fisher-Price Baby Playzone Kick and Whirl Carnival arrived as a gift. My son at 4 monthes liked the colors and the balls moving around in circles but he was easliy over-stimulated and he got sicks from watching it. Now that he is sitting up,and pulling his self up he's trying to grab the balls off the carvival but he can't remove them and it took all my strenght to remove the balls. Also it opens up on the bottoms for the balls to move around but he isn't into at 10 monthes. It also can change into another toy but it'a a pain. The spinner rattles can move into other areas but they won't stay. It's just collecting dust on the floor. It plays music but it's loud, annoying and hard to turn off. This is the worst toy for the money. This is the first fisher-price toy,the kids will not play with it."
4,My daughter loves it,"My 2mo. old loves this toy. She dances and sqeals its so cute. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because she isn't able to kick it hard enough to turn it on, so I have to start it every few minutes. Its still a great toy and I highly recommend it."
1,My baby is TERRIFIED of it!,"We recieved this baby gym as a gift and it is the worst thing ever created by the hand of man. Not only is it LOUD with OBNOXIOUS music, but the lights flash rapidly and the balls and patterns spinning would give anyone a headache let alone a baby. It is also very difficult to switch it from the over head position to the upright position (unless you are extremely good with using your feet and knees as extra hands). I gave it the benefit of the doubt and had my baby try it. SHE SCREAMED HYSTERICALLY until we turned it off and removed it from the room. Now every time she sees it she starts screaming again. I am so sorry I ever took it our of the box!"
2,Very Hard to Kick,"We purchased this toy today, and I am SO upset that after a 15 minute set up, I am going to be breaking it down to return. Our 3 month old played with a 'kick gym' at her cousins house and absolutely loved it, so we purchased this for her today and it is so hard to get to turn on. I thought by the little feel on it, it meant that when she kicked the feet it would turn on, like on the Playskool gyms. It doesn't. It only turns on if you kick it hard enough to shake the whole gym. Even the hanging down toys don't move very well, so they don't help to get the toy on much either. Then, to top it all off, when she finally does kick hard enough to start it up (she is VERY strong, and yet was only able to achieve kicking hard enough once) it plays music for about 5 minutes before it stops, so they don't learn that the music is starting because they are kicking it because it is too long before they have to do it again. I would not recommend this toy to anyone. Go for a playskool."
4,Colorful Toy!,"I bought the toy for my very active daughter when she was 2 months old. She would kick and kick her feet, so I thought this toy would be perfect.At first I was disappointed because the kick part doesn't really matter, the baby can kick the toy anywhere and it will go off. It was a bit much for my baby at first, so it sat in our living room not being played with for several weeks, but then we tried it again and she loves it! I have to prop up the back of the toy on a pillow so it doesn't slide across the room, but it keeps her entertained and happy, so who cares!And it came with batteries, wich is a plus! Our friends brought their 10 month old over and he loved playing with the Kick and Whirl too.I wish the toys were easier to reach for my daugther, but she'll enjoy playing with the toy when she can sit up too.Overall, I'm glad we bought the toy."
1,Wish there were a lower rating than 1.,"I was so relieved to see that other reviewers felt the same way as I. I was so excited when I purchased this toy because my 3 month old loves to kick! What a joke! The ""kickpad"" is nothing but a hard plastic lid that is not electronically connected to anything-how then do they suggest that it is ""kick activated?"" I'm returning mine as well. It slides all over the floor and doesn't work as promised. If only there had been a negative rating...I would have used it."
1,Do Not Buy!,"This toy is a total waste! My infant had absolutely no interest in it. I couldn't return it because I threw out the box, so I sold mine on ebay. Many others sold theirs on ebay stating their child had no interest in it either. All it did was take up space in the room/"
1,Don't Waste your money!,My son was totally uninterterested in this toy. All it did was take up space in the room. I sold it on ebay.
1,Unnerving and loud,"Can't recommend this toy. The music is loud and too much like a carnival. You can't lower the volume enough to make it acceptable to any adult in a 50 foot radius. The balls come off, which sounds like a good idea and they are large enough not to pose any choking hazard but once removed the rotating ""area"" loses its already limited appeal. I used it twice before I sold it to a used toy shop and both times I suspect my daughter (5mo) was trying to kick it away from her.BTW I got a fisher price aquarium floor gym which is delightful."
1,Piece of Junk!,"I bought this toy for my then 3 month old daughter because she loves to kick like quite a few other parents stated writing the previous reviews. Once the pieces were taken out of the box I could not believe the piece of crap ""kick pad"". It's just a piece of plastic that has nothing to do with activating the toy. She seemed to show more interest in the toys that what seem like they should be withing reach, but they were up by her knees, well out of reach(which caused me to accuse my husband of putting it together wrong, poor guy).Plus, I find it to be obnoxious and our poor dog is afraid of it because when he walks in the room it goes off for no reason. Far from kick activated. I am relieved to see so many parents feel the same. One good thing is that now that our daughter is sitting up, she seems to enjoy it a little more, since she can sit in front of it and actually reach the toys. But it is still a disappointment."
2,Caution when using,"I bought this toy about two weeks ago and its been nothing but a headache. The round piece in the back that keeps the toy from flipping over does not work. Today when my 6mth old was playing with it she was sitting up and leaned on the toy to get a ball and it flipped over. Its a great toy for when a baby can only play with it to kick, but otherwise i do not recommend it, I think fisher-price needs to recall it and make it more stable."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought this for my son when he was about 4-5 months old (11 months now). At first, he loved the idea of looking up and seeing the wheel with the balls. That lasted about 3 days! He got so bored with it everytime I would place him underneath it he would scream at the top of his lungs. Definitely not a toy to hold an infant's attention."
2,I Just Don't Understand.....,"Well, this toy i THOUGHT was going to be an awesome toy for my 3 month old but instead I found it to be very annoying..After almost a month of having it I still can't figure out where exactly you are supposed to kick it to make the music start. It seems like it just goes on & off when it wants to. My son tries to kick the middle part where the ""lil' feet"" are but sometimes he'll kick so hard & nothing (he has a kick & play piano & has no problem & Loves it WORKS much better....i would recomend that instead) while other times he'll kick it lightly & it'll go off maybe we bought a defected one...who knows?! But I wouldn't waste my money on this toy again nor would I recommend it to anyone...I would have only given it 1 star but MAYBE when my son gets older he'll like it more?!"
2,Don't bother,"We received this toy as a christmas gift. Although it looked exciting on the box this toy was more trouble than fun. After twenty minutes of assebly time, we discovered that our two month old could not reach the spinning toy. It is not sized for infants to be appropriatly positioned, the foot kick is to close to the arch. Although he was fascinated at first, he soon became frustrated when he couldn't restart the music. Also the toy is also not weighted enough for kicking. It quickly scoots out of reach as my son kicks it. Perhaps when he is able to sit up it will be more fun, but this is not an appropriate toy for an infant as the age reccommendation states. I would not bother with this toy if it hadn't been a gift."
2,not worth the money!,"received this gift for my 5 month old son for christmas. the toys that hang overhead are too far away for him to reach with hands. the only way they can move is to kick them. i then changed to the sitting up position. when he was sitting (with my support), it didn't seem to have as much action as i thought it would. the balls have to be removed by force to roll out and then placed back in for more rolling out. this seems a little complicated for a child of his age. i can forsee the balls being lost by my 2 year old before my 5 month old is able to play with it. overall, i am returning this toy, definitaly not worth the price."
2,Disappointed,Wish I would have read the reviews here before buying. I was tempted to return it also. I got this when my daughter was two months because a friend recommended getting a toy she could kick. Well she kicks it alright but the thing never responds. I even called customer service thinking something was wrong with it. I had to smack the thing really hard to get it to work. The fisher price rep told me the settings are different sensitivities but I am not impressed. I am encouraged by the other reviews and maybe she will like it when she is older. She is almost 3 months old now and seems interested in watching the lights on the continuous setting. I wouldn't recommend this for a newborn as the box suggests. Live and learn.
2,DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!,This kick-toy is NOT WORTH $30 or more! It is loud (even on low setting) and my baby (now 18 months) NEVER EVER EVER enjoyed playing with this. The plastic balls are hard and they have to be jammed onto the spin part. The toy goes off at the drop of a feather so the baby has no idea whether s/he was the one who made it happen or something else. I could go on with this but I'll just stick to FIND ANOTHER ONE!!! This one is way over-priced for what you get! Too bad since FP usually has such great things!
1,No reward kick and play,This toy does not claim to do what is says- It leads you to believe that the baby will be rewarded by the balls when he/she kicks- It doesn't. Baby basically watches the balls go in circles without any reward for kicking.
4,Very good,"My son really loves this. He loved it months ago as a kick toy and now he loves standing up with it and still plays with it. Yes, it will go off at random. I will only buy a toy with lights/sounds that has an on/off switch and I turn them all off when playtime is over. I don't particularly enjoy the sounds, but my son does and that is who the toy is for. I'd say its a keeper."
2,Not Worth the Money,"The music is horrible...the button to turn it off is annoying I keep sliding it over to the other setting..its not an easy turn off, turn on toy..which doesnt seem like it would be a big deal but when you have a baby in one hand..it is. I can't figure out how to get the battery cover off either...why do you need 10 screws to hold the battery cover on and when you un screw it ..it doesn't come off?? This toy will soon be in the trash!"
1,Hated this toy,"I bought this when my daughter was 3 months, I saw the commercials and thought the toy looked so fun. She hated it, she couldn't kick hard enough for the music to come on and when she did kick the whole thing would move so then she couldn't reach it. She is now 6 months and I have continued to get the toy out for her to play with but she still doesn't like it. She chews on the balls and thats the most use we have gotten out of this toy.Waste of money!And the commercial is deceiving, it makes it appear like the hanging toys spin when you kick and they do not."
2,Didn't enjoy this at all,"I had this in my home for a bit hoping my little one would ""grow"" into it. . .that never happened.As a wee one this was hard for her to kick. As she got older, I thought she may enjoy playing with it, however because she is small, and kind of short, her feet never reached the back with her hands on the steering wheel."
4,It does the job,When my little 2 month old son is fussy I put him in front of this toy and he loves it. He will stop crying and lay there looking at the lights/listen to the music. My only &amp;quot;beef&amp;quot; with this toy is that when the timer stops it's hard for him to start it back up by hitting the little hanging toys. My 3 year old daughter will sit on the floor with her brother and play with this toy too!
2,so - so,"My 3 month old daughter didn't have a hard time with the kick to start, actually that was the easy part. Set up was timely. Hanging stuff wasn't easy to play with. The music on ours only lasted about 5-6 sec. Didn't keep her interest.There MUST be something better and more fun and educational for the money. We're returning ours."
1,This is awful,"This was difficult to put together and once I did my son had no interest in it. The dangling toys were hard for him to move with his feet and when he did kick, the whole thing tipped. I wasted my money and this thing will be out in the trash with the next pick up."
1,???,This toy can barely hold my 6 month old daughters attention. Even my two year old son doesnt like it. I wasted my money...:(
1,A Complete Disappointment,My 5 month old daughter received this for x-mas and I have to say we are so disappointed with it! It doesnt's seem to hold her interest at all and is not interactive as far as being a kicking toy. The balls spin around regardless of if she kicks it or not. A friend lent us a playskool kicker that was a few years old and she laughs and gets so excited when she uses it. It truly is a waste of money.
4,She Loves this toy!!,We got this item as a toy and used it when she was an infant with a boppy pillow for her to lay on and kick and watch the lights. She loved that. It has two volume levels on the back witch is nice. When she was 6 months old and sitting up we moved it to the second position so the balls can slide down the sides and she goes to this toy every time we put her on the floor to play. We now put it on the setting that makes her touch or move something for the lights to continue. Good item!!
1,Not All That Great,"We received this as a gift from my aunt and uncle. The music is loud even on the ""quiet"" setting and extremely annoying. It sounds like some wierd circus music and gets stuck in your head easily. My daughter would play with it for a few minutes and then start crying, she loved the lights but I think the music scared her, she would enjoy it more without the music on. However, it did not encourage her to kick at it. We haven't changed it to the sitting position yet, so perhaps she will like it more now that she can grab at it and be a bit more active. I wouldn't recommend to others."
4,Lot's of fun!,"I agree with some reviews that the age should be 3 months and up and that the batteries are a pain to change. Also you have to put it against the wall or other fixed object because it moves away from the baby every time he kicks it. It does need to be kicked hard for it to work. BUT, when he finally figured all that out he now LOVES it. He will lay there and play for 30 minutes straight. I also can't wait till he can sit up and play with the balls."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!!,I thought this was an awesome toy...until I got it. It is priced high considering it doesn't entertain any more than it does. My daughter payed attention to it the first few days when it was new but after that she lost interest. However the cat likes it quite well! I would never recommend paying $35 for this toy.
2,Not interesting.....,"I bought this toy for my 3-month old daughter. She was okay with it the first time I set it up for her, but after that she seemed really bored with it. When she kicked it, the toy would move back so she couldn't reach it anymore. Now she cries after about 30 seconds of looking at it. I also threw out the box. Maybe I'll sell it on e-bay like many of you did."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,"I bought this toy for my four month old son in hopes that it would take the place of the Kick Start Gym that I had for my daughters (It was MIA). When he kicked it, it did not respond! The music is obnoxious and grates on your nerves as well. Quite a lot of money for such a disappointing toy!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I bought this toy for my son and I thought it looked great from the outside of the package and since it was Fisher-Price I thought it would be a good quality toy. I took it home and finally got it put together (which was a pain - too many screws) and it was a real disappointment. The balls stay on the cirlular thing and you would think they drop off onto the ramps, but no - they just stay on there. It also only has three little attachments that the ball can hit and make spin, but four places to put them. My son was six months old and trying to grab it to stand up and it fell over on him. Needless to say, I took all of the screws back out of it, put it back in the box and took it back. I will still buy Fisher-Price toys, but I will be more selective from now on."
3,baby playzone,my child enjoyed kicking it but it does not stay in place. i had to put something behind it so that it would not move.
3,Not really worth the money,"I bought this for my son when he was a few months old. I don't really think it is worth the money for several reasons.1. When they lay on their backs you have to kick it really hard to get the music to play. I do have to say that it is more soothing to an infant that just stares at the lights and listens to the music.2. The toys could have been a little lower so it is easier for a baby to play with.3. When your baby is old enough to sit on his or her own, the balls on the spinning wheel are snapped on so tight, the only way they can get them off is if you do it for them.My son is now almost 11 months old and has barely played with this thing, in fact I think the first set of batteries I put in it are still in there. I wouldn't spend the money on it, I don't really think it is worth the money:)"
3,"It's ok, but I wouldn't buy it again.","My little girl loved to kick so I thought this would be a great toy to have. I read the negative reviews and I was a little hesitant, but decided to go for it anyway. Before she could sit up, she would try and kick it, but it just wouldn't play the music. Sometimes I even have to hit it a couple of times to get it to play. It was really quite useless until she learned to sit up on her own. She's 7 months old now and she really likes playing with it. She tries to put the balls back on the spinner and she loves to bang on it to make the music play. I'm glad she's enjoying it, but if I had it to do over again, I'd pass on this toy."
1,Kept it 15 minutes.,"Not only was the music like something out of a Stephen King movie, this toy went off like a twisted demonic carnival game when the dog walked by it and the floor bowed. In each play mode -- whether the music played for 30 seconds or 5 minutes, it did nothing to tie the sounds and lights to our daughter's kicking. The entire toy is based on vibration or something - so it doesn't have as much to do with kicking as it does with just touching the thing. We returned this thing about 15 minutes after putting it together - thank goodness our Toys R Us was very gracious and took it back - mangled box and all."
2,Not impressed,"I thought this was like the kick n drive we had, but I was so wrong. A newborn can't activate it like the kick n drive and they can't reach the toys. The only good thing I will say about it is it kept him entertained for about 10 minutes, so I could give him his breathing treatment when he was sick and my 2 1/2 year old likes playing with the balls as well as the 1 year old I babysit. If I had to do it over again, I would've never bought this thing."
2,Kick--but no Whirl,"I bought this for my baby girl to get her motor skills going. I thought it was a little expensive, but hey, she was a preemie, so anything that would help her get caught up would be great. So, I got it home, sat there for the HOUR it took to put it all together (14 screws--more than all of her other toys combined), and put her under it to play. She loved all the bright colors, but something was missing... She understands to kick because we have the Kick and Play bouncer. So, she kicked and she kicked...but no whirl! Turns out there isn't a sensor to tell when they kick--only if they tug on the hanging toys (which kind of defeats the purpose of the ""kick"" and whirl). I would not recommend this toy unless your baby doesn't mind only tugging on toys (which will be out of their reach until at least 6 months of age)."
3,Pretty good kick gym,"we just bought this for our 3 month old, and it kept him busy longer than any of his other toys (besides the baby einstein activity gym) he kicks the hanging toys to make the lights/music/spinning go off instead of the back where the picture of the feet is. the instructions are incorrect also...to put the thing in ""kick activated"" mode, it should be set on II NOT on I like the instructions say."
4,"LOTS OF FUN, HARD TO ASSEMBLE","My two month old daughter loves this toy, she just laughs and smiles everytime she plays with it. She has no problem kicking the toys like some others do. The only reason I gave this toy four stars is because it was such a pain to assemble! I do reccomend this toy, but only if you want to spend a couple of hours putting it together."
4,My triplets like it!,"I have 8 month old triplets. Their abilities each vary and they are actually ""younger"" than 8 months since they were born two months early. We really like this toy. We only paid $5 used but $35 is well worth it. I have 3 different personalities and likes and they all like it. I can say that I wouldn't buy it for a newborn, a baby who is smaller. But a baby who is sitting or can be propped up, it is great. And when they get older where you can tilt it back so the balls roll down for them will be great as well. I use it that way now with them. So it's good for solo play to watch lights and pull on the toys but also it promotes interactive play with Mom to help with the balls being reloaded until they're old enough to do it themselves. We have a ball with it. It can be activated by the baby or you can set it to keep playing the music and lights and ball rotation for about 10 minutes or so. No, I'm sure it won't be easy to store but how many large toys are, lol."
3,Not worth the money,"I got this for my little girl at Christmas she was 5 1/2 months old. She played with it for a little bit, but not enough for what I paid for it. You have to kick the feet part hard for the music to play, my baby could not kick that hard so most of the time she never played with that part. She would spin the toys that hang down and the music didn't always start when she would spin the toys so she would lose interest. As she got older she would turn the circle part where the balls were and it sounded like it would break but it never did. It's an ok toy, but I wouldn't spend that much money on it, find one at a garage sale."
3,Great toy for stimulating baby,"My 11 week old is just getting the hang of this toy. I think this toy recieved bad reviews because the parents didn't read the directions on how to use the toy correctly. The directions are a little bit wordy, but understandable. My little girl loves the music, and loves to kick the toys. I am sure she will use this toy for months to come."
1,Not worth the $,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months b/c she loved to kick, the problem is that this toy isn't set up for that. It claims to have a spot to kick so that the wheel will spin but actually, any vibration makes it spin. When it is kicked, it moves so then I would have to move my daughter. Also, the snap on accessories don't stay on and it's hard to convert to a sit up toy. Now that my daughter's a year old, she doesn't want anything to do with it. She can place the balls where they belong but unless they're in certain slots, the wheel doesn't turn. When it does, all they do is slide to the bottom. SPEND YOUR $ ON SOMETHING ELSE!!!"
2,Very Disappointed!!,"We bought this toy for our daughter when she was about 3 months. She loved to kick and stomp her feet so I thought this would would be perfect for her. When I would put her under it and try to show her how to use it she would look around for her other toys. When she would kick at it, it would move out of her reach. She was not interested in this toy what so ever!! I thought she might grow into it so I would play with her but she never got interested!! I ended up giving it to a friend, hopefully she will have more luck."
4,This toy keeps working for us!,"We got this as a gift when my daughter was 4 months old. She loved to lay and look at the blinking lights while kicking the spinners. She played with this toy the most and the sound didn't bother us, as you can set it to a lower volume.Now she is 13 months and plays with it in the sitting up position. She still loves this thing, playing with the balls, still attracted to the lights that she can now touch, but she doesn't understand the concept yet that she can put the balls up on the wheel and it will roll around and then roll down. So I can see she'll continue to play with this and not get bored any time soon.The downside is the assembly... it is a parents nightmare. But once complete, it was totally entertaining for our little one and still is."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"We actually registered for this item before our daughter was born and finally when she was old enough to use it, she totally freaked out. The music and the noise level totally scared her. The little nobs and things you can pull on are also not very interesting so even when we turned the music off, she was not interested in playing with it at all. We had some other kids come over to our house and they don't like it either, so it's not just our kid that doesn't like it. We are trying to figure out a way to get rid of it now..."
2,LOUD and a Waste of Money!,My daughter is now 12 months old and never showed interest in playing with this thing. It was too loud and annoying. We bought the leapfrog gym and she loves it. I recommend it over the kick and whirl carnival.
3,"Somewhat entertaining, but not perfect","My son has had this toy for awhile. He is now 11 months. He and his cousin have enjoyed its noise and the spinning with the lights. But, I do agree, it was a pain to put together! It also is awkward for little ones not sitting yet. I think your baby has to be the perfect height for this to work right. I don't know if it was just tested on one baby or what, but it wasn't the right measurement for my son to use effectively either. When they can sit up and play with it, it is more entertaining I think. My son really likes the balls that came with it though, and he carries them around with him."
1,Scary,This is the first review I've ever written and I'm doing so because of just how much I dislike this toy. I'm in the beginning stages of buying toys as my daughter is only 4 months old. This toy had a lot of assemlby which didn't bother me but ended up being too tall when she was lying on her back. She's a long baby and kicks her legs ALL the time but coudln't reach the hanging toys. The music was also VERY loud on the lowest setting and only played freaky carnival music. It was too eery for me to listen to and I returned it the next day.
1,THIS TOY IS AWFUL,"I never rate anything this low & usually give in details my review, but this one I will make short & simple. AWFUL toy not even worth $10. Returned it the very next day I think all the ""playzone"" toys FP made stink. Sorry FP"
1,"Waste of time, money and space","This ""toy"" is terrible! We found it to be flimsy and unentertaining. Our son lost interest in a few seconds of the balls twirling around. Very disapointed b/c we usually love F&P's toys."
2,Not as expected,"This toy appealed much more to me than to my child. We bought it when he was 3 months old and he really couldn't get the lights going very well on his own. As he aged he just lost interest in it. Also, this thing goes through batteries like no other toy I've experienced."
2,"Annoying, and not much fun","I bought this for my daughter at 4 months, because I liked that the toy can grow with her from laying down to sitting up. But I sure wish I had read these reviews before buying it. Like everyone says, the music is very loud and super annoying. When she would lay on her back it was awkward for her to kick straight ahead to hit the base of the toy. She did kick the spinning toys pretty good and that would thrill her for awhile. But even then she couldn't stand to play with it for more than 5 minutes tops. Now she can sit, but she is not yet old enough to place the balls in the spinner so they go down the ramps. The only use we get out of the toy now is when we hold a spinning toy in our hands and she bats at it. Certainly not worth the money I paid for it."
1,not worth it,I bought this toy for my 4 month old son and took it right back. I wanted a kick toy for him and was very disappointed. The platform that he kicks is flat (meaning there is nothing for his feet to press). When he did kick the platform the toys did move but that was just because the toy was shaken hard enough. My older son (21 months) played with this for a few minutes but that was it. It does take up a lot of room and for me it was definitely not worth it.
2,Not that impressed,"This toy hardly keeps my sons attention. We haven't moved to the second stage, but I am not impressed with the beginning stage of this toy. It is loud and the the on/off switch often it tricky."
5,So good! My son loves it! Shocked by other reviews!,"For a second, I thought I may have bought something other than what everyone else had reviewed. I have had none of the problems listed by everyone else! My son is 2 months old and LOVES this toy. In fact, when he is in his ""fussy monster"" phase, this toy is sometimes the only thing that will calm him down. As for quality, we've had it for just over a month and it seems to be holding up just fine. It activates at the slightest touch, which is good for my little Luke but yes, the music does tend to drive me crazy. What do I care? It makes HIM happy and that's all that matters. He just stares at it, totally entranced by the music and movement. I LOVE THIS TOY it has been a lifesaver for me!"
2,Not happy....,"I bought this toy for my 3 month old & she never really took much interest in it. She couldn't reach the toys to kick at & kept rolling into the side rails. Once she figured out how to crawl & pull herself up (she's 7 months now), this toy became a hazard. She pulls up on it & I'm just waiting for her to lose her balance and hit ever nook & cranny on the way down to the floor...the edges aren't very soft, it's such a hard toy...I honestly wouldn't recommend it, I wish I had returned it the first time she expressed disinterest..."
1,Hated this toy!,"I'm sorry, but this is a horrible toy. I didn't check reviews before buying this toy, and boy...did I regret it! It has the most obnoxious music ever and sometimes the music wouldn't even play when my son kicked it. I returned it and ordered the Classical Chorus Gym which got 5 stars on the reviews. I'll let you all know how it does when I receive it. But in the meantime, don't waste your $ on this Playzone Kick & Whirl...you'll regret it just like I did."
3,Disappointed,I bought this for my father for Father's Day. I have traced our Campbell clan to the Campbells of Argyllshire. He liked it. He does not know as much of our history as I do.I didn't like it. Three short dvds. I could have read more information than the movie talks about. For me it was a waste of money and even my time to watch it.But it was for dad and he like it enough.
3,NO re-enacted fighting scenes. Just like a visit to a MUSEUM,"I totally agreed with another reviewer, Susan Oliver, when she said she did not like this set of DVD because it was short. She could get more information from reading books than watching these DVDs.Another thing I don't like is there is no re-enacted fighting scenes. There are just video of the castles, graveyards, landscape and interviews of the descendants of the historical figures. It's good only for people who already know the historical facts and want to get more pictures or videos related to them. For me, it's more like a visit to a museum. If it had re-enacted fighting scenes, it would be more lively and interesting.Luckily, I borrowed this from the local library instead of purchasing it."
3,This set doesn't fit on train tables!,"This train set is well made, especially the trains themselves. The track is smooth and well-crafted. The construction vehicles are wonderful. It would be perfect but it does not fit on any of the standard, large train tables. If you want to use it you either have to re-configure it (hours of confusion), use it on the floor or put it on an enormous piece of plywood. I would rather have purchased a smaller set that fits properly on the train table. They should list the dimensions of the set somewhere so that consumers are properly informed."
5,Dissappointed,"Wished it fit on the table I bought it for. It is too big. The dimensions are 51""X35"" much too big for my table."
3,fun set but a little too big!,"I bought this train set because I don't like the 2-D people that come with most train sets. It is a fun set with lots of pieces but unfortunately when assembled doesn't fit on our NILO train table. (I don't know about other tables.) The pieces can be assembled together, just not the way it was designed so you have to get creative and leave out the ups and downs, which is okay anyway because they fall apart very easily. Overall, still fun...just not all we had hoped."
3,If you're interested in this theme...,"...you should read John Macmurray's book, Self as Agent, where he argues that touch is the primary sense, not sight... Sight is about distance, and fosters a Cartesian split in how we experience the world. Fascinating"
4,Delightful,"Lady Gillian Marley doesn't want a husband but unfortunately she will inherit her late uncle's estate ($600,000 pounds, 8 ships and land in America!) only if she is married before she turns 30 in two months. She turns to her two life-long friends who each give her a ""HUSBAND LIST"" of marriable men. Only one name is on both lists - Richard Shelton, the Earl of Shelbrooke. Gillian decides to invite him to her home and propose a marriage of convenience. Richard (goodlooking and a hunk) was once a rake but had to settle down when his father died leaving the family almost penniless. Despite his new stability, he has a deeply guarded secret he must keep from everyone. This is a delightful book, full of fun and enjoyment."
2,Just Plain Silly,"If you've read Georgette Heyer or Amanda Quick you'll be disappointed, as I was. The inconsistencies and the intrusion of modern thinking in a historical romance made it just plain silly.Ok for the beach if you have to watch the kids swim while you read, you won't miss much if your concentration is only half there."
1,Could easily put it down. . .and did,"What a boring story. I couldn't have cared less whether or not these two people got together. Silly plot, boring characters, etc. It all makes you wonder if anyone can get published if they can just finish a book, no talent necessary. Not only did I put this book down, I never picked it back up to finish it."
3,Amusing.,"The plot is rather simple and I will spare you yet another summary of it. The plot is not that original. I feel that this novel would have been sunk if it were not for the sheer amazing number of entertaining supporting characters. The main characters don't share so much as a kiss for over a hundred pages. Often their motives aren't well explained, realistic, or even believable. Each time the two of them argued I felt like the author had a desired outcome in mind and no real plan to get there;the end of their arguments were so at variance with the start. The most dramatic moments were written in such a way that they were barely speed bumps in the sequence of events in the story. Lady Gillian and Richard are likeable characters. The story is amusing. Not laugh out loud but amusing. This is the first book I've ever read by Victoria Alexander. I can see that she has talent and I would like to read another book by her. Hopefully next time I will pick one that delivers more excitement."
5,A HUMOROUS REGENCY ROMP!,"This was a terrific read. Fast, fun, and humorous, it is the perfect book to take to your last day at the beach before the kids start back to school.Gillian and Richard were fun, and tender. Ms. Alexander really knows how to write a hero that you would LOVE to meet. Non-stop action from beginning to end, this book will leave you with a smile!"
5,I liked this book,"This is the second Victoria Alexander book I have read, and I will be reading more in the future. Her writings are witty and warm, and I am so happy when I get to meet my heroes again in the next books, granted I do think I am reading them backwards. =) But I do know I will be seeing them again, I will be reading all this wonderful authors books. They are keepers."
5,Very entertaining!! My idea of a romantic hero!,"Richard of Shelbrooke is my idea of a romantic hero. A great read....After I read it the first time, I had to go back and read this again. Lots of fun and twists and turns."
5,Must have for flying wing followers.,"This is the book that is written by the man himself, Reimar Horten. It give specifications for all of the planes the brothers built from 1933-1960, and talks about the problems they encountered, and their solutions. I need to learn German because not all of the book is translated. It is an eye-opening look at the work of two geniuses. Jack Northrop wasn't in the same league as these guys."
5,Nothing more fun than a ViewFinder!,"If you need a trip down mem'ry lane and want to delight your coworkers, get one of these and stock up on slides! 3-D is so much fun and I still haven't figured out how they do it!"
2,Cute story,"This is story of two people wounded by scandal, and the way they struggle to live their life to the fullest. Rosaleen Fleming is considered amoral by inheritance since her mother is a former courtesan, while Lucien St. Cyr tries to conceal a family scandal. They meet and despite the ruthless gossipers they become close friends. Then, a serial killer emerges, murdering former courtesans after sending them a letter of warning. Both Rosaleen and her mother receives these letters, and it becomes urgent to locate the killer.I find the story entertaining, and the murder case is quite original. But, the book will not be one of my favourites due to the characters. They continue to be strangers throughout the book, and some of their actions don't seem to correspond with the characters they are supposed to be. All in all, an easy read that is soon forgotten."
1,Just Sad,Anyone who believes this is in denial. The Greeks did not copy their entire culture as some would have you believe. Just sad.
1,A lot of myth,"While I realize there are a small number of African/Americans who buy into these racist falsehoods, it is important to understand why. Many have an enormous lack of pride due to the conception of low ethnic achievement. Thus the need to CREATE/BORROW history from the ancient Greeks. This is actually quite sad, and is widely lamented by most truthful African/Americans"
1,"Wow, this is bad","What a shame. Let those who are ashamed of their lack of cultural achievements create history so that they may increase their pride. ""We created nothing, let us steal the Greeks' history. They copied everything! Umm....we had no written language, but let's ignore that inconvenient fact for a few years."""
1,Disgraceful in it's lies,"How can I say it? I do not consider this history, just fantasy or science fiction. Now, before anyone gets upset, I know these books are use to improve self-esteem in certain groups because of a lack of historical achievement. This is a great disservice. Why can't one say: ""Sorry, your ancestors did not develop a written language, we have nothing to tell you. Tough."""
2,Interesting but lacking in scholarship,"Kudos to Diop for trying to disrupt the Euro centricism of most historians, but Diop goes far astray from any hint of objective analysis. He hangs his hat on any theory as long as it promotes blacks and minimizes the influence of whites. For a more detailed analysis of the many flaws in his work, take a look at Not Out of Africa by Mary Lefkowitz."
1,He is blinded by his passion,and unfortuneatly quite wrong. This guy is considered a joke by historians. He does not use scientific methods to prove his points. Quite a laughable book.
1,Pathetic,"I can't believe people actually take this drivel seriously. Facts, what facts? Archeology, what archeology? Let's use pure emotion to teach students a history they want to believe."
1,Worked for a little while,"This is a great unit, when it works. I used the carpet cleaner twice, and it worked great. Recently, pulled it out to use it and the brushes do not rotate, so it really can't clean the carpet very well. It sprays a little cleaner and sucks it up but doesn't scrub the carpet. It should work more than twice."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Product will work well first time, but is limited by a 5/16 inch diameter piece of plstic (stem) at front of unit. If it gets bumped and breaks, unit will not function.I called company, and they cannot do anything as entire base of unit is involved.I will be returning unit. BAD DESIGN!!!!!"
5,AWESOME!,"I have been doing cryptoquotes for awhile now and this book was great! I am someone who does not like any hints. I keep going until I get it! I recommend this book to anyone who is an avid ""cryptoquoter"""
2,Couldn't Wait for Crytogram-a-Day Book to Come,I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in the the Cryptogram-a-Day Book. It did not have the hint letter to start the puzzle off.
3,Design Flaw,There is a flaw in the design that puts stitching on the inside which is abrasive to the skin. I tried 2 different wraps and they both had the same flaw. Have had to put a piece of felt over it when I need to wear it for back pain.
5,Feels good,"I've had severe back spasms, catchy back get stuck. Heat or cold gel, tight fitting, good for me about a 30"" waist. Comforting. It's a keeper for me."
3,can't rate because it was too small,I ordered this product for my husband but it was too little so I sent it back and promptly got a refund. I wished it had come in a larger size because it really looked like a good product....there is a removable gel pack that can be either heated or cooled depending on what you need......I will be keeping an eye out for this product locally to see if I can get it in a larger size. The only drawback was the cost I incurred to mail the product back
2,You must BOIL WATER to microwave!! BE WARNED!!!,"Had I known, before ordering, that in order to use the microwave heat...1 - you must BOIL WATER in the microwave - you can NOT put the gel pack in the microwave directly2 - you place the gel pack INTO the heated water3 - you are advised to USE TONGS to remove the gel pack from the water4 - somehow, while handling a VERY hot gel pack you must now use your hands to stick the gel pack back into the pouch (without burning your hands? the gel pack is a VERY tight fit in the pouch)...I would NOT have purchased this dangerous product.People make mistakes with boiling water every day and acquire severe burns.This product is going back for a refund - I'll NEVER purchase a product that requires boiling water (unless it's coffee or tea - which is dangerous enough).Hope this helps.Range"
3,WARNING: DO NOT USE WITH A PACEMAKER,"I have used a HoMedics Therap Back Brace for years. After years of use I needed to purchase a new one. The original one had a pack of magnets that were placed in the pouch but could be removed if not needed. This one lookS similar but the magnets are not visible and cannot be removed. On the box it states: MAGNETS SHOULD NOT BE USED BY INDIVIDUALS USING PACEMAKERS, INSULIN PUMPS, TRANSDERMAL DRUG DELIVERY PATCHES OR DURING PREGNANCY. NEVER PLACE OVER AN OPEN WOUND.....It also states that the magnets should not be washed, but where are the magnets?. Since I have a pacemaker I am concerned. I was able to wash my old brace so I think I will wash this one and hopefully I will be able to use it. For a back support I would give it 5 stars Because of the warning I will only give it 3 stars........"
4,I like mine,"I have been very happy with my HoMedics wrap and I particularly love the ice pocket feature. I have to ice down every 2 hours or so for inflammation and the fact that I can walk around while icing down is tremendously helpful. The wrap offers medium support, and is easy to put on. I wear mine under my clothes. I do not use the pack for heating so I cannot comment on that part. The instructions do say to boil the pack for heating....and like a different user suggested....you can do this easily by wearing gloves to insert it into the pouch after boiling, as it does fit snuggly in there.My only beef with the wrap is the fact that the large main strap part is made of mesh and is not as supportive as I would have hoped. The only support you get from the wrap is with the two extra velcro straps that you tighten once you have the wrap in place. I would have liked the main part to be made of something that would hold stronger than mesh. Despite this, I still like my therapy wrap."
3,"Great back wrap, poor magnetic qualities","If all you want is a back wrap with heat/cold, then this is the one for you. It stays well-closed with the large Velcro swath, and offers wonderful support. However, if you are looking for magnetic therapy, this will disappoint you. There are no actual magnets that you can feel, merely ""magnetic waves"" whatever the heck they are...they look like some sort of metallic threads woven into the bands. I am a huge fan of magnetic therapies having had excellent results with both improved strength and more rapid recovery from injuries of knee, back, and hip. I am fortunate to get immediate results from good magnets, but I got nothing from this. I give it 3 stars because it is a good wrap, nothing more."
4,Great product,"This is an awesome belt! It provides just about instant relief and great back support. It's a little bulky but it still fits fine under clothing, I wear it to work and school all the time. The only real issue is that the gel insert has to be heated in boiling water and cannot be microwaved (not much of a hassle at all). I highly recommend this product to anyone with lower back pain!"
5,Excellent Reading,"I would recommend this book for everyone--from teenagers to adults. It teaches us right from wrong, and the consequences we face if we make the wrong decisions. It teaches us that it really does ""pay off"" in the end if you DO make the right decisions.I encourage anyone who is in business for themselves, or working for Fortune 500 companies to read this book. There are many great lessons to be learned!"
2,Totally awful except Scott,"This movie I have to give some credit- it tried. Dear God, you can tell it tried. It almost tried too hard. It ended up sucking none the less. The whole thing has a 'late-night-low--budget-movie feel to it. It revolves around Petey, an ex-smuggler who spent most of his eairly life in prision because of a mix-up with his older brother Matt (played by Scott Cohen, my favorite actor). Petey (Lou Dimond Phillips) is being 'checked out' by a female reporter (who he ends up sleeping with, oh wow, bet you didn't see that one coming). His brother is partners with a dirty cop named Doc, and that's all I care to talk about. Matt get's killed and there's smuggling, more dirty cops, gun fire, and more dirty cops. I think this was a 'I'm-a-nobody-actor-and-I-need-a-salary-NOW kind of thing for all involved in it. I really like Scott Cohen ('10th Kingdom,' 'Gia,') but PLEASE!? What were they thinking??? Oonly a good movie if you like the main stars."
3,Not - So-Sure Yet.....,"I bought this horse for my daughter who just turned one, she has yet to show that much interest in it. She'll climb on it from time to time, rock back and forth for a couple of minutes, and go to something else. This toy at the present moment doesn't hold her interest. I'm hoping as she gets a little older she'll grow into this toy, as this is a cute rocking horse and for the amount of money her dad and i spent its well worth it in durability."
3,Liked it,"I bought this toy for my daughter's 1st birthday. She was a little scared of it at first, but now (4 months later) she has shown interest in it. She does not spend long stretches of time playing on it, but does play with it for a few minutes from time to time. For the price, I'd say it's a pretty good buy."
2,the murphys,I HAVE TO RETURNED TO THE STORE BECAUSE MY SON TRIED TO GET OFF AND HE HIT HIS NECK WITH THE HANDLERS. HE DIDN'T LIKE IT....
4,Wonderful and Cute-But the Stickers!,"For our son's first birthday, we bought him this item. It was easy to assemble and it is strong and durable. The most challenging is the stickers! Ughhh! Why could Fisher Price not taken care of this detail. I was so frustrated with those stickers!Trevor loves the music, and enjoys it, but does not stay on it very long. Little by little he seems to like it more. Maybe it would help if he walked and was able to rock himself!Overall it is a great product at a wonderful price."
3,horse is a good product,"It's a really neat riding toy. It was definently overpriced for what you get though. Just because it was just discontinued they are overpricing it on amazon, ebay, etc... I would say you can get another riding toy just as good for half the price at wal-mart. Nothing special to this horse, but it is nice looking, and has neat music that plays when the child rocks on it. It's well made, sturdy, and easy to put together. Overall it's a good product."
5,Beautiful and illustrative way to approach Mexico,"I loved this book!!! You can tell that it was written from the heart, specially since the author, Jacqueline Larralde de Sáenz, writes about her own prehispanic collection (one of the biggests private precolumbian collections in the world). It is full of wonderful pictures of unique prehispanic pieces, which heve never been seen before by the public eye. A beautiful work of art for both experts / collectionists and amateurs."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH ALL RX-7'S,"Ok if you have the speed sense power steering this WILL NOT WORK for you. This thing smashed my turn signal cam and my car would BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP at me every time I drove it, I took the thing off and on thinking it was ME for weeks before I realized the wheel angle sensor was pooped out of place."

4,young gymnast,"This 5ft balance beam is a fun learning tool. It is a bit short for more experienced gymnasts, but still provides a space for daily practice. It is close to the floor, so it avoids any sense of fear."
4,smells too strong,I have been using it for a week. I really dont like the smell. It's suppose to be grape seed and I guess that's what I'm smelling. Anyway it is an extremely strong smell and that's all I can smell if my hands are anywhere close to my face and I have a very dull nose. It seems about the same as any other hand lotion. A small amount will cover both hands and make them feel moisturized unlike cheap watery feeling lotion. The ironic thing is I broke 3 nails in the last 2 days. Now this may just be a coincidence since I often break my long nails so I'm not using it as part of my rating. Will try to update my review after I use it longer.Update 6-22-12:Upped the rating to 4 stars. I've gotten used to the smell so it's no longer overpowering. Still guarded about the broken nails. Broke a few more last week but once again probably more due to my job entailing a lot of handwashing. Leave a comment if you know a very good hand lotion to prevent brittle nails.
2,"Great for cuticles, but be careful!","After reading favorable reviews from users of different nail products, I decided to order two tubes of this product for my cuticles. I must say that the cream has done a good job on my cuticles. Since the tube says that the cream is good for hands, I started to use it on my hands, nails and cuticles. My wedding rings are wide and cover my ring finger almost to the knuckle. Within a week, the area under my rings became swollen and red; the skin is actually burned, showing the impressions of my rings. Some ingredient in this cream reacted badly with my rings which are 14K yellow gold. Never has anything like this happened to me from a hand cream."
5,DIAMONDS,LOVE YOUR CRYSTAL JEWELRY!!! THESE WERE PERFECT WITH JEANS OR DRESS UP. SUN/LIGHT MAKES THEM SHINE LIKE DIAMONDS.
4,Frontier hardships for Whitehaven woman.,The story of a difficult and remarkable life illustrating the difficulties faced by women in the Victorian era and the dramatic hardships faced by all on the Texas frontier. Being taken from journals the style is idiosyncratic and sometimes frustrating. Whole paragraphs spent on the dress worn to a ball and barely a line on important events. Some slight inaccuracies on her early life in Whitehaven being taken from memory. On the whole an interesting read and quite uplifting despite being ultimately a tale of tragedy.
2,Not what I expected,they only show pimp c once in the whole dvd. Its all about pimpin ken and his life is pretty lame.
2,Bad promises,"This book claims (among other things)a) to be for all levels of developersb) to have online contentThe problem with promise a) is that the book is only useful for newbies. Reasonably experienced developers find almost nothing here that can't be found in the standard F1 help.The problem with promise b) is that the online content is missing. I registerd at the website as instructed in the book, but the link to the source code examples points to a 404 (not found) error. I sent a mail to the contact address supplied at the web site but received a delivery time out a few days later. Really lousy service.Apart from the above problems the book is probably quite useable to anyone new to Notes/Domino development."
2,"Difficult reading, lots of information","IMHO A lot of information. Not for casual reading, I found this book difficult reading. It seems to be written in a complicated fashion on purpose. In many cases the author could say the same thing with 60% of the words. I don't advocate books should be written at a 5th grade level, but this would be a much more enjoyable read if it wasn't so much work."
1,"Extremely Biased, Eurocentric","JM Roberts should not be allowed to call this book A History of the World. Maybe Eurocentric account of the world today...explanation of history through a biased lens... I'd just like to quote my least favorite line from this book, which proves my point...""Although most Africans and Afrikanists like to claim that humans decended from africa, we are not Africans in any true regard...Africa has had little to offer the world except its natural resources...Africa was a place where things happened to people rather than a place where people did things..."" Case closed."

1,"Looks good, functions bad","My wife and I loved how the clock looked, and were very happy with that aspect. The problem is first it can not keep the correct time. We tried all the tricks people suggested here, but with little to no luck. It might keep time for a day or so, but then you find it is several hours slow. New batties did nothing to help this. And it is more of a quirk, but this thing is loud, the second hang really ticks loud. So loud in fact we kept the door closed to the nursery, it could be heard throughout the house. We might try to replace the clock mechanism with a higher quality one to see if that helps."
4,"Super Cute, But Noisy","The clock looks adorable on my little girl's wall, but we had to wrap the mechanism on the back with bubble wrap in order to make it quiet enough not to wake her up in the night."
2,Numbers are spaced incorrectly,"This clock is cute, but the numbers are spaced really far apart at the top and then all squished together at the bottom. It makes it look like the time is off, when its just the spacing of the numbers."
1,Very loud clock,"I bought the baseball clock. Unfortunately, this clock is very loud. If you don't want to hear the loud ticking, then I recommend not buying this clock. It's a shame because it looks nice in a little boy's room."
1,Sooo loud,"Man, this thing is so loud. Anyone know a way to quiet it down? I've had to take it out of my son's room. It keeps me awake .. in the room next to his."
3,Took a few tries but now is keeping time,"I got the Pixie Stix pattern. It's really cute but it didn't keep time originally. I'm not talking about a minute or 2, it was 2 hours off after running for 12 hours. It also makes the loud tick tick sound if you want it for a bedroom, something good to know. And it has a second hand. Update - after a few tries it's keeping time. I had to start with all hands at 12 and move the minute hand around to the correct time, or just set it at noon."
1,Does not keep time,"We bought this clock for our daughter's room. It kept time for the first couple of weeks, but then appeared to stop. We replaced the battery, thinking it might have been an old battery and reset it. The clock kept time for about a week and then lost about an hour a day. We kept trying to reset it, but the clock continued to keep bad time. I replaced the battery one last time, but no luck. I would not recommend buying this clock at all. Looks nice, but just doesn't work. It is a waste of money."
1,Poor,paint is smudged and incomplete It is clearly an imperfection and will be returned Poor Quality I am very disappointed
3,Okay for a decoration...sort of,"This clock was purchased primarily to fit the theme of our baby girl's room, but also to be a functional timekeeping piece. The primary issue is that the clock hands are incorrectly lined up with the numerals on the face, and it doesn't seem to be something that can be adjusted. The result is that it's pretty tough to tell which hour is actually the correct hour (is it 5:30 or 6:30??). It's not usually a real problem, as we are generally aware of what hour we're within, and the minutes don't have to be that precise (it's not like we're running a railroad; it's a baby's room!). Cosmetically, the clock is okay from a few feet away, but upon close examination there is glue smeared across the face in a couple of places which was kind of irritating. As I said, it's okay, but just marginally."
1,"This is not a good clock for children....or adults, for that matter","I would have given this 0 stars if that had been possible. I purchased this clock for my 5 year old granddaughter. However, problems with it caused me to change my mind. Problem one: The clock arrived with hands loose, and falling off. When I got that problem fixed, I noticed Problem 2: The numbers were badly tilted. The photo of the clock when I ordered it showed the clock hanging in a tilted position, but in reality, the clock hangs in the position shown in my photos. This would make it very confusing for children learning to tell time. Neither is it a good time piece for adults. I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews I read before I ordered it."
2,Difficult to Read,Black hands on a brown background make this clock difficult to read in all but the brightest of rooms. Useless at night or early morning with minimal light.
2,not working,"I received a defective clock, sometimes it worked and sometimes not. Returned it from where I purchased it but never got a refund"
4,"Cute, but...","there was glue and small scuff marks on it. (I got the cupcake one) Also, when I received the package, it was already opened; I think the UPS man re-taped it for me?! I really don't want to go through the hassel of sending it back for a replacement, so I'll deal with the glue and scuff marks. I wish they'd pay better attention to the packaging though :\"
4,Monkey Wall Clock,"I absolutely love the look of this clock for my son's baby safari-themed nursery. The ONLY complaint I have is that it is a little tough to read a few of the numbers on the clock. If the numbers were colored so that they showed easily on the monkey's brown parts, I would have no complaints at all. It is a cute clock, and so long as you know the locations of the 12, 3, 6, and 9, you will not have much trouble at all!"
3,"surf clock, ok from a distance","overall if you don't get too close it looks pretty good. However the closer you get the more apparant it becomes that it is made of poor quality material. The first clock I received didn't work, the battery holder was so loose it would not keep time. The seller did make things right & sent a new one. I have had no problems with this one, but still overall, it's just okay."
1,"very pretty, but totally useless","It ticked long enough for me to hang it on the wall, but as soon as I came back into the room, it didn't work. I tried multiple batteries and could only get it to work for about 3 seconds."
2,Loud second hand,"We liked the look and easy to read (for our son) face of the clock, unfortunately the second hand had a loud tick that we couldn't seem to drown out. We returned it."
2,Cute but junk,"I purchased this item for my kitchen. It has a great pattern, excellent color to detail but it can't keep time. At first we thought it was the battery, after trying atleast 7 different new batteries it was obvious that it just don't keep time. It was constantly loosing minutes through out the day."
5,A Must Buy,"This book is wonderful. Not only will it teach you all you need to know about Design Patterns, but it makes a great reference to keep around. I have read a lot a materials on Design Patterns and this book is by far the best!"
4,Good book for Software Designers,It is a good direction for the Software Engineers to learn about patterns and designing the applications.
3,.NET DESIGN BOOK,"I HAVEN'T REALLY USED OR READ TOO MUCH OF IT YET, DUE TO 11 OTHER BRAND NEW BOOKS FOR THE SAME JOB, BUT I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO PLAY IT'S PART IN THE BIG PICTURE.THERE ARE NO COLOR PICTURES BUT THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DESIGN DIAGRAMS."
4,fashion design program,"we are in the women ready clothes production line and we are looking for a supplier of women clothes fashion design program, please advice the ability of providing such program"
2,"Overrated, but does have utility - 2 stars max","This book is overrated, but it does have utility in bringing to your attention design patterns --which should be obvious to any good programmer--such as the Singleton (object only capable of instantiation once).Why do I say obvious? Because any programmer worth their salt will over time develop their own home-grown library of patterns and exemplars to reuse. This book merely calls attention to this habit.Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the text is too generic and abstract, unless you're into that. Donald Knuth anybody?Plus the book is too expensive--if you must, buy it used like I plan to. That's right, I haven't read it yet. But I know enough just reading these reviews; sometimes you CAN judge a book by the cover. I am over the age of 13, yes."
5,Excellent description of common patterns,This is an excellent book for anyone who is seriously interested in programming or is writing any non-trivial program.Good description of common patterns. A good supplement to your OO Methodology books.
4,"Great book, but JAVA programmers beware","First let me start with the good points about this book.This book absolutely rocks in terms of ways in which you can write a beautiful piece of code. The authors have picked up the best recipes which are time tested to create a book which should help everyone from a beginner to an expert. The book has been written for C++ programmers and requires some amount of experience in object oriented programming (hence java and c# programmers are fine too).The bad points are:It's old. The current and only edition came out in 1997. A second edition is long overdue. A lot has changed in the software methodologies since then. JAVA already incorporates a lot of things that are mentioned in this book. An example in point is the iterator pattern. Hence, a better book for JAVA programmers would be JAVA Design Patterns Explained or Head First Design Patterns.Still a pretty great book..."
5,Now that you know what inheritance and polymorphism is...,"What do you do with them? This book provides real strategies for tackling common design problems, through the use of reusable ""patterns"". I read this, and I immediately saw the difficulty in designing entire GUI frameworks (like OWL, MFC). There are far more other kinds of problems that this book provides solutions for. This book is one of my favorite classics, and works as a reliable reference."
4,"Scientific book, not a course","dry reading, I didn't read it cover to cover, but that's not the intent of the book anyway. If you're into Design Patterns you ofcourse must-have this book for reference. To learn Design Patterns, start with another book then come back to this one"
5,Required reading for software engineering,"I had heard quite a bit of rattle about design patterns. Reading the book made the rattle sensible. However, as nothing is perfect, it would have been great if there was discussion about scenarios in which more than one pattern could have been used and how would each scenario fare. Well, such thing can make a book by itself. However, such comparison makes it easier to comprehend the application of patterns which is harder than understanding a pattern in a given example. Anyways, this is something that a software engineer would need to read before embarking on large projects."
4,"Great book, but difficult material","This book contains all of the standard software design patterns. The examples are good but can be vague at times. Otherwise, this book is a must have for software developers!"
5,Definitely a must for any budding OO developers.,"Generally computer langauages are taught with too much emphasis on syntax, rather than the semantics.This book helps to illustrate how an object oriented language's behaviour can be used to solve problems at a higher level of abstraction."
5,Must read for every programmer,"Of all the programming books that I've ever read, this one has had the most impact on my programming. I require that all programmers who work for me read Design Patterns."
5,Double Dispatch,"Thats all I have to say. Go check out the visitor pattern, this thing saved my life (well, at least my job)."
5,best design patterns book,This is the best design patterns book everlanguage is simple.examples are usefullthis is a must-have book
5,A key reference for any college-level computer library covering object-oriented technology,"DESIGN PATTERNS: ELEMENTS OF REUSABLE OBJECT-ORIENTED SOFTWARE is a key reference for any college-level computer library covering object-oriented technology. It will appeal to object designers and developers, covering the roles patterns can play in systems and referencing well-engineered patterns developers can apply to specific applications sets. From how these applications work in real-world settings to code that shows how it may be implemented in C++ and other languages, DESIGN PATTERNS is packed with important references."
1,A well written book on spaghetti coding,The book advocates making code that is more indirect and complicated for no benefit. Design patterns are a scourge in the field. If you want the complexity of your software to mushroom in complexity then this book is for you.
2,Fall asleep while reading this book,"There is nothing new here for an experienced developer. It MAY be useful for fresh graduates but I am not sure. It would be more appropriate for designers to come up with real patterns that solve real problems, not just follow patterns stated in this book, which are mostly over-kill or far away from real world. Can't understand why so many people gave it high ratings, and even more people talking about patterns with so much proud."
1,"Hardcover not acceptable, print more softcovers",I know everyone is going with eBooks these days but I do some plane travel and to have this book in paperback would be wonderful. I believe they are missing out on a lot of sales due to the paperback being out of print.
4,A very comprehensive book on Design Patterns...,"Contains many design patterns, and explains many of them through a very thorough example of building a word processor. The only problem with the book is that at first it's hard to understand for those who have no idea what design patterns are..."
3,So so,"Although this book initiated the now-famous design patterns phenemon,I think we have better alternatives these days.The book has sample codes in C++.I personally liked Head First Design Patterns."
2,"Good, but too complex","The ideas presented in the book are great, but the writing is too complex. The book could be re-written with simpler and far fewer words. More examples are needed.I use some of the design patterns frequently, yet when I read the book, the descriptions are extremely dificult to understand.I usually have more experienced Java programmers explain the patterns to me. All of them say the book does not explain the concepts in the best manner."
4,Helpful Reference Object-Oriented Design Textbook,"This book clearly presents dozens of design patterns appliedto ""real-world"" applications.Whereas the design patterns presented are usually basic intheir nature, the book provides a glossary that can alwaysbe referred to, and provides concise and importantterminology and descriptions."
5,One of the few books that created new fields.,"If you are a C++ (or any other OO language) programmer,this book is a must.You may already know about iterators and such, but thisbook will put it all in context, giving you a new way to viewyour program.If you are not OO programer, what are you waiting for"
4,Great book that any coder should read,"I thought this was a great book on OOD, but I would be careful on how far you take it.What I think it's useful for is understanding the different ways that you can design a piece of software. That doesn't mean that you should be cookie-cutter about it though.It's like... seeing abstract art, realism, black and white, etc will help you be a better artist. It'll help introduce you to difference way that you could represent something. That doesn't mean that you should imagine something you want to paint and say ""oh, this looks like a time for abstract!"" and apply the other artist's approach verbatim.OOD is the same way. You should absolutely read this book to introduce you to different ways of designing classes and methods. Things like the Factory class or Singleton class may have never occurred to you. But don't start trying to force-fit one of these design patterns to any all problems."
4,Good choice,Excellent explaining about the design patters even for those who are new to it.The only problem is that the samples are in C++ wich should be expected because the book was printed in 1995.
4,The original,"This book is refered to from almost every pattern article or book I have seen and is well know for being the classic pattern book where all the others derive from. Written before the Internet boom most of the examples are related to GUI programming in C++ or SmallTalk, but it is still easy to think about how to use the patterns in the presentation/business/data layer of a modern application (there are also plenty of other books that covers that).The best part of the book in my opinion is the implementation section that exists for each pattern, where the authors discuss specific implementation issues in regards to the pattern just described. Often I caught myself thinking about these issues while reading the pattern and it was very satisfying to see that this was known issues and that they were discussed.The reason I do not give 5 stars is that the book can be a little bit dry reading from time to time."
1,The best computer book on your shelf you will never read,"In 1993 this book was groundbreaking. Patterns in C++? Java was just an idea at that point. By now there are many, easier to read and apply, books on Design Patterns. Often they can be language or domain specific. Enterprise Patterns, Ruby Patterns, etc.If you have a tech bookshelf at work this book has to be on it, but you will never need to open it."
3,"Good concept, good material, hard to read","i think this was the first formal book on software patterns. It's certainly the most popular - every senior object guy i know has this. It has some good material in it, and if you haven't at least memorized the names of the patterns in this book, you might get left out of a few conversationsThe one criticism i have is that the authors are clearly not professional writers or teachers. This book is BORING. Really, really boring. It's still a good thing to own, but you ain't gonna read this cover to cover in one sitting and, many times, you'll probably have to steel up your will and tell yourself it's good for you before you crack open the book. It's a good book, but it was written by professional programmers and it showsOf course, i don't know anyone who took the concepts in this book and wrote something easier to read, so you probably should buy this one"
3,On a see-saw,"In reading this book I felt as though I were on a see-saw. Some concepts are described so clearly and succinctly (often an isolated paragraph or even just a sentence) that I felt I was really learning from the book. At other times, the examples were so academic and so far from useful in my day-to-day work, that I felt I was wasting my time.I bought this book because you if you're serious about using patterns, you have to be able to say you've read and understood it, but ultimately there was much less practical information than I had expected."
5,A Classic,"It's been a couple of years since I bought this book, but I never had to time to actually sit down and read it - until now. And what a masterpiece! Having worked in the software industry for more than 10 years, I recognized a lot of the patterns described in this book (though not always by name), but I also discovered a couple of new ones that I will probably find use for in the future.There is not much I can add to what has already been said about this book (just look at the sheer number of positive reviews at this site). It is very informative, yet easy to read. In my opinion, one of the most influential books you can find on software design and patterns."
5,The Classic Catalog,"This is THE dictionary of design pattern!Do we comment on dictionaries?The structure is neat and searchable,I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction though for those who get bored quickly"
2,If you want to waste your time ... This is the right place.,"This isn't a self contained book ... to really understand it, you will find yourself searching at wikipedia and/or in several other books/sites ...In other words, you will only learn studying by other sources! So if you time is short, skip this book. Try the Head First Design Patterns ... (any other book shall be better)."
5,A brilliant civilization.,"Egypt: Quest for eternity is a must have for anyone who is seriously interested in that which once was, millenia ago, in the Nile Valley. This film treats these marvelous monuments and their builders with the respect and dignity that they most justly deserved then, and still deserve today. National Geographic's Egypt:Quest for eternity is an entertaining, thought provoking journey into the distant past, ""in search of the essence for the meaning of life itself"".*****/Five Star rating."
3,National Geographic's Egypt-Quest for Eternity,"A bit boring at times,there is one part which I thought was Sweet:The Little Old Lady(Not from Pasadena.)And how she practices What she works in(Egyptian Studies,even though she is not Egyptian,which I thought was Odd-People are always trying to be cosmopolitan which is Annoying.)the video Looks old and grainy at times,Mind you I saw this on Netflix Instant so it was not much better.A lot of information that most who know on the subject would already know,If I am not mistaken the good News is I did not recall seeing Dr. Zahi Hawass Once.Which is a Miracle given he hogs the limelight in all these Documentaries."
3,Dull,"This video is old and shows it. It has many facts, but presents them in a way that loses my attention. For pure information, it is good."
2,THIS MOVIE IS BORING,"this movie, yes it shows all the facts, yes it shows the pictures, yes to all of what you could want except one thing...it makes it seem soooooo boring....i'm supposed to write a paper on it and i have all the info but i fell asleep watching the movie!"
4,One of the better books in this series. . .,". . .providing a clear and concise outline of various philosophical disciplines and points of view.The need for a book like this is becoming increasingly important, as more and more Christians -- from all backgrounds -- seem to be lacking in the understanding of the basic philosophical presuppositions which underly their theology.In this book, the interested student will not only become familiar with the philosophers themselves, but with cogent explanations of various key elements of philosophy.Recommended."
2,A sad volume in this series,"What the heck happened, did they not have enough money when they made this?The demon transformations weren't drawn, but computer morphed (?), the voice actors for the two demon kings, and the civilians were awful, and the big fight scene between Dante's demons and the Demon Kings was soooo slow and looked like it was done with wires. And I'm not even going to talk about ""you know who"" being the real villian.I can only hope vol.4 will make me feel better."
4,Great Mix,"I really love this disc. The songs didn't really seem to go together, but they are all beautiful. I really love track 2. Highly recommend for a truly relaxing experience."
1,GREAT BOOK but EBook/Kindle not available in the US? WHY?,"Bought a Kindle so I'd have my favorite books with me always. HOWEVER... ""I,Claudius"" & ""Claudius the God"" are not available in the US. WHY?????? And does anyone know how to sign up for Amazon UK?"
3,Please make available in U.S.,"I have just started reading e-books and would very much like to be able to read I, Claudius on my Kindle app. What is the reason that it is not available in the u.s.?"
4,"Well, Well, Well!","I must extend some well deserved propers to Luke Thomas. It's quite certain that the brothers are holding down the writing scene in the 2003. New comer Luke Thomas packs a powerful punch inside his compact novel Saxual Feelings. Drama, comedy, romance, and more drama are what you'll get when you step inside the pages of Saxual Feelings. My fellow Amazonians this one is a must read! Daryl C. Diggs surprised me with his compact novel ""That's The Way Love Goes"". Now we have Luke Thomas who lends a new refreshing voice to the genre. A little southern flava always adds a little seasoning to the mix. Look out world, I think these brothers are sure to make a lasting impression in the world of fiction. It appears that they will be shaking things up. Grab yo self a copy today!"
4,Unique Storyline and Unique Voice,Luke Thomas explodes onto the literary scene with a novel that while a quick read is also packing a lot of drama and intensity. The ending was quite a surprise and I look forward to reading his next effort.
5,Perfect Product,"I purchased the packets of Woolite for my trip to Italy. They were the perfect size and they were not heavy for my suitcase. I received them in a timely manner, the whole process went perfectly."
4,looks good.,"I have not played this game before but it looks fun to play because its an anima game and most all anima games are fun like dragonball z budakai 1,2,and 3 yu yu hakusho dark turnament and inuyasha and the secret of the cursed mask well thats all I have to say."
4,One of my favorites,"""Dave Barry turns 50"" and ""Getting Old Sucks"" are my favorite books about getting older. Read them while you still have the visual acuity and functioning synapses!"
3,It gets old,"I was required to read this for a Literature class suprisingly and this is the first Dave Barry book I have ever read. Although I probably will not subject myself to another one willingly, it was better than I had expected. I dredded reading the book but found myself laughing out loud a few times. If you are a Dave Barry fan you will enjoy this book and if you don't mind listening to quite a bit of history you will also; it just gets old after a few chapters."
4,A Baby Boomers wet dream...,"Dave Barry Turns 50 is less about turning 50 than it is a humorous recounting of growing up a Baby Boomer.Barry chronicles all the major events, fads, trends and people who impacted the life of a typical boomer. Along the way Barry unleashes heavy doses of his wildly funny wit, recurring punch lines and he even throws in a bit of social and political commentary to boot.If you're a Barry fan or an aging boomer then this book won't disappoint. Plenty of Barry humor to chuckle at and lots of references to stuff and events to which every boomer can relate.However, if you're new to Barry's world then I suggest you start with one of his other works - Dave Barry Slept Here for example. It similar to Turns 50 in the way it's constructed and written, but the humor is turned up to high and the commentary is turned completely off (except when used to poke fun at something).Though Turns 50 goes back to the fence...it's not a quite a home run."
3,"Not Dave's funniest book,","This is not Dave's funniest book, nor even his best-written. But it's still very funny, and still worth reading. It has a section that involves reminiscences of the ""formative"" boomer years from 1947-1974, plus various ruminations on getting older, and is well worth reading when you want a few chuckles."
2,Is it just me?,"Is it just me or was Dave Barry much funnier 10 or 12 years ago? It seems like it used to be when I picked up a column or book written by Dave Barry I was guaranteed to laugh out loud. Now, it just seems that I smirk a little and find myself reading lines that I swear he's written somewhere else before. Is it just me or has Barry really lost his edge? He was never a biting, witty type--always a good-natured, fun type of guy. But somehow he just doesn't seem that funny anymore. If you want a real laugh, get ""Dave Barry Slept Here"" or ""Dave Barry's Only Travel Guide You'll Ever Need."" They're much better than this one."
3,"Not a laughing explosion, but quite educational!","I just started my reading of Dave's material, and I have to say, I wasn't laughing my head off, but the positive thing about the book is that it made me learn a lot of things about Americana in the mid-20th Century. Fortunately, I have never had problems with heating Pop-Tarts, I'm so-so on the hula hoop, and Richard Nixon did get us out of the Vietnam War, which is one of his few angelic deeds. Dave does put light into the dark happenings of the Baby Boomer generation, and he tells it like it is. I guess that I could recommend this book to someone who is in the 50-range when it comes to age. Pretty amazing since I myself am only 22. Anybody in my age group will enjoy learning about their parents' young days. I guess that I could read some of Dave's other books, because I like to absorb myself in pop culture. One thing, though...why does Dave have such an obsession with Buffalo Bob Smith? The guy is DEAD! G-whiz."
3,Losing his touch,"Not as funny as ""Slept Here"" or the computer book from a few years ago. He seems to have lost his touch a bit. If you're interested in Barry, get one of his earlier books, which are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and skip this one."
2,"Seemed to drag on, unlike his column","A big fan of Dave Barry (I have most of his books), this book went in a different direction. Mr. Barry did not enlighten us with his normal wit, instead what we got was a year by year, until 1974,summary of what happened, along with some commentary. That's why we have history books. Dave's views of boogers and exploding toilets are hillarious and will continue to so as long as he sticks to his column."
2,Not one of Barry's best,"I'm a big fan of Dave Barry's essays. This book, however, left me a little cold. Admittedly, there are many funny parts. But, there is also a very long winded section covering three decades of American (and personal) history that isn't much fun. If laughs are what you are after, try one of Barry's earlier compilations."
1,Not one of his better books; for Boomers only,"I don't mind when Dave Barry writes serious material, but unless you're a Boomer, you're probably going to find this book just plain dull."
4,Very humorous,A quick and funny read. The glass is still half full with all the best settled at the bottom of the glass.
5,"a touch of maturity in there, too","The guy is gross, goofy, really really funny, but he's not the tenage moron he sets you up for. I read this book on my way to Japan for the first time. It was a great flight companion and every word of it turned out to be true. How he could get such insights out of so short a trip, with kids in tow amazes me, but my point here is that he handled the tough stuff--racism, pacifism...you know, the NOT FUNNY!!! stuff...with the compusure of a monk! Really. I would have read the book just for the profound insights (sorry Dave). As it happened my trip coincided with Bush's declaration of war on Iraq. Had I not read his chapter on Hiroshima, I would have been blindsided by the questions I was asked in highschool classrooms about the American attitude toward war. Intestinal fortitude or not, I vote for Dave to represent us around the globe."
4,I liked it,"I received this book as a gift and although it's not my normal genre, I decided to give it a try and was very pleasantly surprised.Though there was a difficult period about a third of the way through, the characters hung on to my attention and by the half way point I was completely hooked and eager to get back to them and find out what would happen next.I've only read a few books all the way to the end in the past 8 years since my first child was born, so by that standard, this one is certainly exceptional.Very entertaining. I'd recommend it to anyone."
2,Boring and Banal,"The story has been used ad nauseam, the writing style is pedantic and ill-paced, and the characters are dull and unrealistic. It was so boring that when I accidently left the book under a stack of others with only about 80 pages left to read, I completely forgot about it. I have just found it, and I am not going to bother to finish it."
2,good- very depressing,"I was into this book until the end-- I won't ruin it, but its safe to say it is depressing. The characters were all unlikable."
1,Bad Romance- No History,"This book was one of the worst examples of historical fiction I've read. It focused on the Romance aspects, which were somewhat dull and repetitive; and it was lacking in historical accuracy. I was extremely disappointed, I expected a story about the intrigues of the Welsh court life, and a good story line, but I got a book about some snobby queen and her affair with the popular court jester. I don't suggest wasting your money on this book."
4,Hmmm,"You know, I came across it looking for Welsh based history novels. Its no Sharon Kay Penman, but its not a bad book. At the flip of the same coin its not fantastic either. Its a good story, characters were strong and more 3 demensional in the beginning, and as a whole it was creative and well executed, but it was so hollow and improbable, especially toward the end, that you just cant grasp onto it. Everyone you get to know and really like in the beginning turns into an asshead 5/8 of the way through. So it was dissapointing on a few notes. But, I would recommond it. Everybody has different likes. Other people seem to adore it. 3.469 Stars,.. haha, now Im an asshead."
2,soap,"soap opera with a patina of history. a good read for those so inclined but if history is important forget it. in the very non graphic description of sexual possibilities the term ""threesome"" was used. i was going to report this as an anachronism but, hey, maybe i should read some more historical non fiction to be sure."
4,fun toy that's light enough for young baby to hold,i bought this toy for our 4 month old after she happily played with one at a friend's house. she loves the colors and is able to grab and hold it by herself due to the fact that this toy is lightweight and designed for such play. great addition to our toychest!
5,Perfect for 3 months to 9 months,"My daughter loved this toy. She pulled on the tags and loved the bright colors, shapes, and patterns. It went everywhere with her and it has held up well after many washes and messes. I highly recommend this toy."
3,A Good Book with a lean towards the British Viewpoint,"I thought the book was quite good, but however being so removed from those times I was left with an impression that the author had lean towards justification of British colonization. I am yet to read a truely balanced or neutral book on this subject.Another point I noticed is that the book focuses more on Pakistan and Bangladesh and ignores India almost completely after the partition (independence), which I found suprising. Also a nice additional chapter that could have been a nice ending was to look at the current state of relations between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and also a look at the relations between Hindu's and Muslims in India."
1,A biased perspective,"This book by UK politician Patrick French is junk.Two examples:One, the author says India's independence movement would not have worked under Stalin's Russia since Gandhi/Nehru would have been summarily executed. By this logic, Britain would not have had magna carta if Attila the Hun was its King at Runnymede!Two, the author says that a few ""volunteers"" and not Pakistan Army invaded Kashmir in 1948. Is this still in dispute? Really? So passe.Unfortunately I bought Patrick French's 2010 book on India last week; allegedly a history of a billion people. Now, am apprehensive. What is the focus this time? Two billion arm pits?"
2,Not her best work,"Like the Death of Sleep I do not think that this book is one of the better works of Anne McCaffrey. I had read almost all of her other books when I read this one, and I was very disappointed. It had a very hard time just finishing it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is expecting something on par with Dragonriders of Pern Series or the Powers That Be Series..."
3,Don't even attach the back of the chairs,"I bought this set for my daughter because I fell in love with the pattern, and was looking for a wooden table and chairs set. Well everything is wood but the backs of the chairs. They are compressed cardboard. She hasn't even had this set for six months and both of the backs have already broken off! One from just falling over and landing on a toy. I DO NOT recommend these chairs for small children they tip over very easily with the backs on. So to avoid all problems don't even attach them."
2,Not so nices for,"This could be more resistant, and it is not practical. Additionally, the quality is very bad. I regret it, but it is just ok."
3,Cute But Cheap,"The table was cute but arrived from the manufacturer with a severe crack from the entry point of a screw. Also, the screws keep coming loose because if you make them too tight, they either strip or crack the wood. I ended up getting a refund from the seller for 50% of the cost. I would not pay more than $30 for this product in the future."
5,I LOVE CHICKENS,"I'VE ALWAYS LOVED CHICKENS AND BEEN FASCINATED BY THEM AND OFTEN EATEN THEM. IN THIS BOOK, I FOUND THAT I ALSO COULD BE VERY ENTERTAINED BY A VAGRANT CHICKEN'S EXPLOITS. A QUICK READ THAT IS A PERFECT BOOK FOR A PICNIC, JUST LIKE CHICKEN."
3,W.W. Wittgentstein,"This book has the wost format of any mathematical text I have ever seen. The author's favorite Greek letter is small Xi. A page littered with these presents a real mess for the eye to decipher. All his other notation is hard on the eyes. How the author expected this text to be widely used I do not know. Still if you can stand the eye strain this book has some good things in it, but not enough to be worth the effort of thorough study."
2,It'll mummify you,This Egyptian documentary is very dated. Low quality picture. Maybe a VHS transfer to DVD. Looks terrible on a flat screen. There are no closed captions as well. Not recommended.
3,Its Ok,I found this to be somewhat informative not as much as others like Ancient Egypt Unearthed but this will satisfy your thirst if you are an ancient egypt fanatic like me
1,Egypt Secrets of the Pharaohs,"I purchased this DVD as part of a presentation in my Anthropology class because it was described and reviewed as containing a detailed re-enactment of the mummification process. I was very disappointed. Other than salting the cadaver, very little was shown, and camera angles interfered with what was briefly touched on. If this was a segment that you are interested in, this DVD is not for you."
3,"Nice pans, but hard to maintain","I have bought several of these pans. I really like the weight and the balanced feel of the pans. They do an excellent job of cooking; however, you must be very careful with them. If you do anything like put cold water in them to soak while they are still hot (which they warn you) or don't clean them well enough and reuse, you will have problems for the rest of the life of the pan. I am disappointed they are so ""tempermental"". I have tried to be careful (never put it in the dishwasher, used plastic utensils, etc). If you follow the directions to the letter, you will like them, but beware that you will have problems if you don't follow their warnings perfectly. Food now sticks to the pans. I feel for the money, they should have lasted longer. I have only had them a year or two."
2,Doesn't tolerate more than medium heat,"Pan looks and feels great, but I've now destroyed three of the them cooking with medium heat. All the bottoms are warped."
4,Nonstick Omelet Pan,"This is a very good heavy weight nonstick omelet pan. If you use your pan frequently, I find the most non stick coatings only last 1-2 years, even on the best quality pan. I just try to find pans that are not overly expensive and then replace them."
5,Wonderful,Works just like one would expect a non-stick omelet pan to work -- things don't stick. :-)
1,Not for me.,For some reasons did not work for me. I only washed by hand and i start to see rust on the handle after 1 use. Had to return it and purchased a pan Bakers&Chefs from Sam's Club. Sorry Calphalon!!
3,The Non Stick Surface Wore Off,"The cooking performance is very fine. This pan has higher sides than some other skillets. Even though the handle is metal it's design keeps it cool to the touch. I was very disappointed though that the non stick surface started to bubble up and wear away in one spot after about a year of use. Other than that, I like the pan. But non stick pans that don't have durable surfaces have no place in my kitchen. For that reason alone I cannot recommend this pan."
2,Tossing it after less than two years.,"This was a great pan when it was new, but after using it [anywhere from] 0-5 times a week for just under two years, it's ready for the garbage. I never put it in the dishwasher or used metal utensils, but there are gouges and marks in the pan and it has lost its non-stick...which is disappointing because I loved this pan."
3,Definitely Not Dishwasher Safe,"It's a good pan, but when they say ""Wash By Hand"" they don't mean it might get scratched by bumping against other pans. The outer coating mostly washed away! Surprisingly, the non-stick surface was fine, but the outer coating on the bottom and sides is practically gone, leaving a very rough and splotchy colored surface. I'm hoping another time through the dishwasher will take the rest of the outer coating off so that it's at least a solid aluminum color and won't be so rough to the touch.I used Cascade dishwasher soap, if that matters."
4,great pan,Really like this pan. Good size for an omelet. Good for a little stir-fry. Doesn't stick. Follow use and cleaning directions and you will be happy.
2,it's okay... but,"We bought this pan 1 1/2 years ago and use it a lot, but the non stick part is coming off and we never put it in the dishwasher and only use the plastic utensils. so.. for $29.50 it's okay, but don't expect it to last a life time. calphalon will send you a new one, but you have to mail in your old one first..."
2,Bait + Switch,"Ok - So I have an older (2 yrs?) version of this exact same pan, which I really like, and use constantly.Same Calphalon product id etc . .So I feel confident ordering this one based on my previous experience . . . Mistake . . .This is NOT the same pan in any way, even though it has the same Calphalon Product code etc . .The metal in this pan is about 60% of the thickness of the older version, and is far too thin for any serious use.It also has a ""re-designed"" 2-rivet handle that is of a far worse design then the older 3-rivet design.The pan has also been significantly reshaped, reducing the effective heated surface, and now featuring a prominent 1/4"" vertical lip around the edge which I find interferes with the use of the pan . .It's about a 3 for actual usability, and a 0 for Calphalon for continuing to reduce the quality of their products.I won't buy another . ."
2,review AFTER an YEAR of use,"Initially, it was truly a wonderful frying pan, as reviewed by all. Within 1 year though, the entire non-stick surface is gone. Few things I followed for this whole year: (a) Only hand-washed, now only (since coating gone) I dish-wash the same (b) Never used metal spoons, spatulas, etc. Nevertheless, the coating initially started developing scratches, now it's just rough and coarse all over. Anyone having this should follow I guess ALL the precautions, i.e. (a) Never use anything metallic (c) Never stack with other utensils on top (c) Never use high heat to cook (d) Never put in dishwasher (e) Never clean while hot, must let it cool first. I believe the coating is good, but very thin to have worn out this fast."
4,Why I love this pan and Calphalon...,"When I first got this pan I thought it was a little heavy, but after using it...love it. I have been able to saute onions and potatoes to a flavorful brown, scramble eggs to perfection, cook pork chops and the pan still cleans up so easy.I also like the responsiveness to heat...it takes temp changes well..heating up and cooling off pretty fast. The shape is good with that nice little flair and deep enough to do a lot more than omelets. A plus is that my Calphalon lids fit - both the glass 10"" and the stainless lid.At this price this pan is a bargain. And of course I love that free shipping and good customer service of Amazon."
2,Shopping to replace,"I am a big Calphalon user, but this pan has no balance. You need a brick to keep it flat on burner/stove top. As a result you can forget about cooking anything that requires more than half the surface. The handle does stay relatively cool, but without a counter weight on the other side, it is useless. Currently I have to prop it up on one side to cook an omelet!"
2,Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 10 inch Omelet Pan,I was hoping this would be a replacement for my worn out Calphalon Pan. I returned the pan because it was very lightweight and not the same quality as the pan it was supposed to replace. Calphalon does have a lifetime warranty on their pans & I am happy to report they sent me a new pan matching the quality of the old one.
5,Callphalon Omelet Pan,"Wonderful. We are really enjoying this pan. It is just right for 2 people. Hopefully, in the future I'll add more pans to my collection."
1,nonstick came off,I purchased this pan just over a year ago. Already the nonstick coating has started to peel off. I am very careful both with the use and care of this pan (it has never seen the inside of the dishwasher). I'm extremely disappointed with this pan. I'm sure that if I send it back to Calphalon under the warranty they'll find a way to deny my claim for a replacement so I'm not going to bother.
5,1928 Jewelry,quick and just what I wanted. And should not require 14 more words required.What-? View tips and guidelines | 6 more words required.
2,Earrings 1928 jewelry,These earrings lasted one day. I lost one of them because it came out of my ear and I did not realize it. I really like the bracelet that matches it.
3,"pretty, but fragile","1928 has beautiful jewelry, and these aren't an exception- but the circular piece popped out after a few wears. I'm not rough on my earrings when I put them away so I was disappointed."
5,"Up Close and Personal,Well Done","As the wife of a retired NYC Firefighter, I thought this DVD was excellent. It showed the daily lives of firefighters and what 9/11 did to change all that. The two families that were interviewed who lost their husbands and dads were not rehearsed and little things that we all have taken for granted (such as a father walking his daughter down the aisle) makes you realize that you have to love and appreciate your family while you have them. It is not overdone, it is an honest look at men doing a job for low pay (John Travolta made 20 million to PLAY a firefighter, what's wrong with this picture?) because they are dedicated to helping people. I also believe that whatever monies made from buying the DVD new part of it goes to the families of firefighters."
4,Works Great,"As an adult that has had a problem with incontinence for the past two years, I woke up with a very bad case of diaper rash about two months ago. I tried the normal products that I could purchase locally for weeks and nothing helped. I finally purchased the Butt Paste from Amazon.com out of desperation and because of the good reviews that it received. The Butt Paste has worked very well for me. It has a pleasant smell, applies easily and soothes the itch and tenderness from the rash. My symptoms are almost completely gone at this time which I am very thankful for. I am very happy with this product."
5,Recommended on Diaper Rashes,"We use ointment every time we change our baby's diaper (who turned 1 year old today!). She has only even had 2 diaper rashes because of this, but recently had a bad one. We used Desitin and it wasn't seeming to do the trick. I looked online at how to cure diaper rashes, and among the other methods (bathe them, let them be naked, use wet towels/washcloths instead of wipes), it said to use a combination ointment, which combines both the zinc oxide and the petroleum jelly (aka, Butt Paste!). I put it on every time I changed her (and I changed her twice as often) and the diaper rash was drastically better the next day and gone by day 2. I will be buying a big tub because we already ran out of our little tube! I highly recommend it, even over Desitin! I have learned my lesson and will never stray again!"
2,Didn't work for us,"Didn't get rid of our baby's rash; seemed to make it a little worse even. Nice scent, but won't be buying again for lack of effectiveness. Burt's Baby Bee ointment is much better and doesn't contain petroleum, though it is more expensive."
2,Smells like chai tea,"I found that it works just fine (soothed baby's bottom, protects, etc.) but I find the smell to be weird. Not bad, just odd. Somewhere between a chai tea latte and oatmeal raisin cookies ...gone wrong. I also found that Boudreaux's gets a little grainy between the cracks after a while. I don't think this causes baby any harm/discomfort, but for me, it's a little icky. My favorite diaper cream in the world? Weleda Calendula Diaper Care. Smells herbal and clean, goes on smooth - we've used it proactively and haven't had a single rash or problem in our baby's 4 months of life. The best!"
2,Didn't really work for us at all,"I received this butt paste for my baby shower and was really excited after hearing all of the great reviews. Unfortunately it doesn't work for us. My son develops diaper rashes and personally, I don't like how thin it is when you apply it - it doesn't seem to do the job well. I like the idea of it being in a tub though, as it's much easier when you're changing the babies diaper to just dip your finger in rather then squeeze a tube, but that's really the only part I like about it!"
2,Made diaper rash worse,My daughter has very sensitive skin and we battled diaper rash for a while. I tried a few different creams including Boudreaux's. This product made the rash worse. It caused her skin to crack and seemed very painful. We finally visited pediatric dermatologist who prescribed a prescription cream which cleared it right up. I was told for future rashes to use only Vaseline/Aquaphor because most diaper creams have a fragrance added that can irritate the skin more.
3,Stains cloth diapers,"I can't speak to how well it works on diaper rashes as I noticed immediately that it stains cloth diapers and had to stop using it.It's also a yucky tan/brown color, which again, doesn't impact its performance... but it's just not the color you want (staining your diapers) or rubbin' on your lil' one's bum!"
3,Good for general use,I find this good for general maintenance during every diaper change. I slab on a good amount as a barrier for my 2 month old but if he starts looking a little tender I'll use Burt's Bees. I find Butt Paste doesn't work well on an actual rash but is definitely good if you just want to use something to keep baby's skin protected from wetness. And the stuff lasts forever! Our tub isn't even halfway gone and I've used it for almost every diaper change of the past 9 weeks.
5,Buttpaste Never Fails!,Buttpaste never fails to clear up my sons diaper rash the same day. I've used so many other products and this is hands down the best.
4,Butt Paste works!,My daughter had a diaper rash that the A&D; zinc oxide cream would not heal. I started using Butt Paste after every diaper change and the rash was gone within 24 hours. I'm docking one star though because it is really hard to clean off of her bottom.Update: I use buttpaste in conjunction with A&D; ointment and breastmilk and my baby's bottom has never looked better!
5,Best diaper rash ointment there is,"This stuff is excellent. It works much better than Desitin or A&D. It goes on and wipes off easily. It has a pleasant smell and it really works well. Not only is it great for preventing and clearing up diaper rash, but it works well on other minor skin irritations too. Plus, this 1 pound jar will last until your average baby is out of diapers. Nearly twenty bucks seems like a lot to pay for some ointment, but Boudreaux's is well worth it."
4,"Second-hand reports, only",Have given Boudreaux's previously to expecting friends and colleagues. After they quit laughing the later feedback from them about the product has been positive.
5,Best Diaper Rash Preventer,"I love BBP! I started with Desitin, then moved to Aveeno, and finally decided to try BBP on a whim. Turns out it's by far the best preventative out there. It doesn't stick to your fingers and make them gross, but it creates a really clean barrier against moisture. I never change my daughter diaper at night, which means 10 hours in a wet diaper (I know...) and she has yet to get diaper rash or any sort of irritation. Try BBP, you won't be sorry!"
2,does not clean off easily,"I tried this cream once for now. It seems to do its job pretty good when it comes to rashes, but it's very hard to clean. It did not come off using a wet napkin, so I had to give baby a bath."
1,Didn't last,Worked one season before the season was up the pedestal base came loose / broke off I guess and not because I'm hard on things. So I stuck it in a long necked pottery item I have which allowed me to keep using it but wasn't able to direct the flow well after that because it wasn't a custom fit. Then it quit running right before the season was over and that was that. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
1,faulty construction,"Very poor design; broke after only 3 lite uses due to the heavy weight of the fan putting stress on the base attachment. The hard plastic sleeve that connects the fan to the base cracked, making the fan unusable. This wasn't caused by rough handling, but happened on its own while merely sitting in a protected garden shed. Despite being called an outdoor fan, it is too fragile even for indoor use. The misting unit is actually a soaking unit like many other reviewers have noted. Don't buy this. A frustrating product."
1,Not happy,"I am returning my misting fan - NOT HAPPY - does not mist sprays water. If I wanted to be sprayed I would just get my hose. my patio is not very big, if you are sitting next to mister you get wet, and table is wet. If you sit on the other side of the table you feel nothing except the fan. Fan also does not stand very tall, and is made with all plastic parts. Returning product for a refund.Holmes HPF1010A-NM Outdoor Misting Fan"
3,Recommend? Not sure yet.,"Description says: Measures approximately 12 by 16 by 52 inches... Try more like 41 inches tall, this is a short fan. Again like others have said, this fan will soak you, it produces entirely too much water and the misters are not fine enough to keep the mist more that 3 feet away from the fan.Other than that, I have not found anything else I don't like about it. Let me try it out for a bit, apply some hacks to it, and I'll get back on here with additional details."
1,Piece of junk. They didn't honor the warranty.,"We bought this fan and it broke within a week or two. I wouldn't have minded if they replaced it. I called them, and they said that they didn't have any spares, but would send one when they got some in. This was last summer and despite repeated calls, we never received a replacement fan. Its pretty close to a scam."
1,"SO SADDEN, SHOCKED, AND MAD",I was so excited to get my new fan. At first it worked great I loved it. At the end of the first day of use I went to move it and the plastic joint where you attach the pole to the base broke right off. I was sadden and shocked that it broke so easy from just moving it and setting it down. Again it worked fine until I set it back down. ?? Now I have to find a way to fix it!! :((
2,Flimsy pole and base.,"Fan is OK, misting works fine. Fell over once and the pole to the base broke. The pole connections are made out of plastic...."
2,Poor quality of materials,"After 5 minutes of running the fan, the center plastic support piece broke and caused the fan to fall over. Then the next day the fan misting kit cracked and now will not stay attached to the fan.I will give the customer service credit. They sent another fan unit. It was not this unit, but it works for inside. I was satisfied with that exchange, but I would not recommend the Holmes fan due to it's very poor molded pcs."
3,Nothing special,Stopped working after two years of use; was acceptable until then. Did not produce a very strong breeze for outdoor use. Really just another cheap plastic small-appliance made in china that has an expected operating life of 1-2 years.
3,"When it worked, it was good.","I bought this fan a year ago. The misting feature was pretty much a joke for our usage -- way too wet -- not like the fine mist I've seen from a good misting system. Beyond that it worked really well as an outdoor fan. I say ""worked"" because it just stopped working in time for summer this year. Maybe that's just a fluke, like it's just defective, but it's dead now."
2,I am soaked,"I was wanting a fan for my newly screened patio, and I have seen these before in Disney world. This is entirely different. There is no way to turn off or reduce the flow of the misters. If you turn the water pressure down, they dribble. I sat out with the water turned as low as it would go and still mist, and after less than five minutes my clothes are soaked. I am quite cool, but very wet. waste of money to me. might be nice for your orchids"
3,Underpowered and too short,"I missed seeing the full height dimension on this fan and was disappointed that it was so short (the top of the fan can't be more than 30""). The fan doesn't move a lot of air, especially for my needs outdoors on my creek lot deck, but the misting functionality works well (so far) and my girlfriend has enjoyed laying out (sans clothes) in the sun and heat while being cooled with the mist. I ALMOST returned this item, but decided that it was barely passable for my needs.I'm still in the market for a large, inexpensive, drum or barrel fan to move a lot of air on my deck."
1,"Great Idea, but not this item.","This is a great concept, but the second time we used it the wind blew the mist back into the fan and it immediately stopped working. I let it dry out and it began working again only to fail 2 hours later and I wasn't even using the mist..I will say that Deerso, the company that ships it has been very professional and wonderful to deal with. They refunded my money immediately and couldn't have been nicer and more apologetic for the problem."
3,Misting attachment dies early,"This was my second purchase of this fan, my first one is still working fine, but I wanted insurance! In the worst heat of summer, this fan makes the patio area at least 20 degrees cooler, and downright pleasant to be in! The fact that the mister hose cracked and leaked badly after only one season accounts for three stars instead of five. Our solution was to pick up one of those cobra-style misters, attach the garden hose, and put it right in front of the fan, which has held up beautifully in all kinds of weather. If you could buy the mister as a replacement item, it would definitely rate a five."
3,soaker fan,"My husband wanted this fan for keeping flies off the front porch of our restaurant. It works great for cooling things down and keeping the flies away, but it soaks people! Not good for a restaurant. Would work great on a patio as long as you don't mind being a little damp."
4,Good purchase,"For the price, this is a solid fan and mists okay. Misting reaches about 5-6ft on maximum speed. A little bit of dripping going on around nozzles but can't complain for price. We're going to try to run the wires inside the tube/leg as both the electric cord and mister tube look a little messy on the outside. But again, for the price, no complaints and actually quite satisfied even if it just lasts the year out :-)"
3,"Readable, good intro to the classic approach","Keynesians and Austrians may battle to the death over what is the True Way to Avoid Boom and Bust, but your average undergrad or interested non-expert just wants an easy-to-understand explanation of why, for example, some people thought the Stimulus Package was a good idea, or why unemployment doesn't appear to be recovering as fast as 'the rest of the economy'. This book serves this latter function well. It uses real-world examples and relatively simple math, both in equation and graphical form, to describe classical macro. It breaks things into the short, medium, and long terms, emphasizing the effects of consumption in the short term, employment in the medium term, and productivity in the long term. Well organized and approachable. Not a bad option for introducing someone to the basic concepts of macro."
4,good,"the book is good and i like it very much. however, in some chapters, the lectures are not that implicit. there is one paper broken in the book."
1,JUNK,This doll is a piece of junk. It looks like something you might pluck out of a game at a cheap restaurant. It smells chemical and is a waste of money. Do yourself a favor and buy a name brand curious geroge. Something by Gund is much better quality.
3,Big...but cheap,It's a good size but is no higher quality than a stuffed animal you'd win at a fair. And it kind of smelled.
1,"DON""T MONKEYS HAVE TAILS?!?!","Poorly made product and the monkey doesnt even have a tail! Of course I didnt notice, but my son did when he got it for his sixth birthday, and became by far the worst gift ever! The only good that came of this was when it was set a flame-which by the way, it engulf very quickly. The man in the yellow hat would be seriously offended by this trademareked pile of dung."
3,Curious george,Well when i got this item ive seen it as nice but then i inspected it and realized it was ripped
2,"Looks like George, but falls apart","There was no confusion - we got the: GEORGE! on arrival, but even if this guy looks the most like the PBS character, the quality is non-existent in this piece. My son does not play with plush toys, so I hoped he would not tear George to pieces, but even tucking him to bed at night, and sitting him on the sofa did enough damage, to consider tossing him out... which I could not do, because, well, you cannot throw the favorite monkey out. After sawing a huge gap on the neck closed, and doing the same in few other places, George retired to a shelf, and looks ok, when not touched."
2,Its extremely poor quality - its like a toy fair stuffed animal.,"My 3 year old is absolutely in love with anything Curious George, except for this toy, he won't touch it. Frankly I don't blame him, the only thing nice on this toy is the T-Shirt."
1,Poorly made - even arrived with stitches coming apart,"Keep Looking!I had high hope for this stuffed animal. Hoped that it was more than a large gumball machine quality toy. I was wrong. Its not soft, it feels sooo cheap, and the stitching is poor as well. It was already coming apart when it was received. Not even fit for a dog toy. Returned..."
1,Poor Quality,"I was expecting something much nicer based on most of the reviews of this toy, but I guess you get what you pay for. I would agree with the person who commented that this doll is like something you win at a carnival game. It is cheaply made. The eyes are glued on poorly and there is stuffing sticking out through several seams. I will be returning this for sure."
1,"Not soft - the face, shirt, hands and feet are made of a scratchy material","This monkey is not soft. My child felt it's face and refused to touch it again. The material for the face, hands, and feet is a scratchy and irritating material. The shirt is also sewn onto the monkey and is that same scratchy material."
4,good option,there aren't many Georges to choose from. My daughter liked this. She takes good care of it and looks like it'll be durable.
1,Horrible Quality,"My son loves Curious George and I was excited to find a large stuffed George online. When it arrived, I was shocked to see the quality. It is not ""plush"" or soft at all. There was no return slip in the box, so now I'm waiting to hear back from Mega Toyland to see how to get my money back. Don't buy this!!"
1,I really regret reading this book to my 4-year old!,"My 4-year old has fears for darkness so I thought reading this book might help! I read it to him only once and I regretted it immediately. Too late, it made him more scared of darkness, now he has to check closets (he never did this before) and is worried that monsters are hiding there. Be aware parents!!!"
2,Mom in Texas,"I bought this book sight-unseen for my three-year-old son. I read the book and have put it away out of his reach. The story idea is great, but I don't approve of guns as toys or of violence (or the threat of violence) as an answer to a problem. Go ahead and call me a liberal, but this book will not become part of my son's library."
1,Not Appropriate. I'm shocked it got accepted for publication.,Not Appropriate. I'm shocked it got accepted for publication.It puts unnecessary ideas in a childs mind. its too violent and the illustrations are too graphic. Would never recommend this book to anyone.
1,Not helpful,"Purchased this book in order to read to my 4 year old that is afraid of the dark. This book was definitely not the solution. No matter that the boy tucked the nightmare into bed with him, ending the book showing another ""monster"" lurking in the closet? Really? Needless to say she doesn't feel any better about bedtime now."
4,Defiantly worth seeing!!!,"I have had this movie on VHS for years and recently transferred it to DVD for my personal use. The music is tranquil and the animation is visually stimulating. However, concerning humans being evil, mean wicked and nasty:) I think the point is driven a little hard."
5,"My effort at going ""green""",Using the clothes line is my effort at going green. I save a lot of money not using the gas dryer... only use it to fluff the clothes for 10 minutes for each load because drying on the line doesn't always leave things soft and wrinkle free.These are like the pins my mom used to use. Sturdy and well made.
3,Good enough,"I've been really disappointed in the cloths pins for sale these days. I still have some of the old spring clip cloths pins from more than 15 years ago. They have a strong spring that you could hold a 15 pound baby on a cloths line. The wife bought a pack of clothes pins at the dollar store a few weeks ago. The spring wasn't much larger in diameter than a small paperclip and the pin literally came apart in your hand when you tried to use it.I perused Amazon and found the Homz/Seymour pins. The reviews were mixed but generally indicated these pins were similar to those produced in the ""old days"". What the hey, they were less than $7 for a pack of 36 so I ordered them. I compared the spring size to the cheap-o's from the dollar store. It was significantly stouter than the cheap pin and didn't fall apart when used. While they were not as good as the pins from the ""old days"", they were good enough for general use and certainly superior to the cheap dollar store variety."
1,Flimsy,"I just purchased these because they were advertised as ""super grip"". Boy, was I disappointed. They are very flimsy, thin, and smaller than I expected. The wood is cheap. The wire joints are not very strong and many are ill fitting so that the clothespins splay to the side when you press to open them. They are definitely NOT the sturdy, tough clothespins I grew up with. Package says Made in China. Avoid them and try something else."
3,the spring is not strong enough.,i ordered Homz/Seymour 11-124-36 super grip wood clothespins from Amazon.com and we wish they had a stronger spring.we can not find any clothespins as good as the ones we have from the 1950s & 60s.
3,"Good quality, not ""super grip""","I was hoping this would be like my mom's clothespins were, but it still doesn't have the grip hers did. Last several years I've noticed they just don't pinch like they used to, which makes it hard for towels and jeans. These pins, however, are made of a higher-quality wood and have better springs."
3,"small, not great, but okay","these are about half the size of my clothespins from back in the day, and like those, these fall apart sometimes too. The wood is not the best either but they are okay for normal clothes, not for bulky things though as they won't get around them."
4,CLOSE,"These seem to be the best ones I can find. They are not quite as strong as my old ones from years back. I guess I have to settle, as there is not much use for them these days, and not much profit for the mfgr. At least some are still available"
2,SUPER GRIP? LOL!,"AFTER READING REVIEWS FOR LOTS OF WOODEN CLOTHESPINS, I THOUGHT THESE MIGHT MEASURE UP - NOT! SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN SOME I'VE SEEN RECENTLY,BUT STILL WEAK COMPARED TO VINTAGE AMERICAN MADE. MORE INFERIOR CHINESE CRAP."
2,weak spring,"Nice nostalgic appearance, and that's about the only nice thing about those. The spring is very weak, the surface is rough."
4,Great book if you're in the right mood.,"When you're finished, and trying to piece the plot together, the whole thing seems ludicrous. But there's a great build up to the middle section of this book, and a great fun twisty scare there, out in a graveyard, in the snow, at night, that's the perfect thing to read late on an autumn night after everyone else in your family has gone to bed. For that alone, the book was worth it."
2,Best left unopened.,"I'm not one who has trouble separating an author from his characters, but as Card is known for wearing his religious affiliation on his sleeve in his writing, I couldn't help but read a little into the views expressed in this novel. If you are a practicing witch, this book will only make you angry; I'm not one and it still bothered me.Aside from this, Card's writing is bland and uninvolving, and the characters are shallow and dull. I found it barely believable that the villain of the piece would be capable of all she's done, although the way it tied in to an early scene in the story was a welcome surprise. Unfortunately, there's nothing else very original.As usual, don't read the Kirkus review above, if you are still interested in the book."
2,Will the *real* OSC please start writing again?,"I miss being completely drawn in and absorbed by OSC's novels. Ender's Game was fascinating, and Lost Boys brings me to tears every time I read it. This one started out interesting, but had completely lost steam by the middle. Predictable in spots, dull and unbelievable in others."
3,Definately not Card's best work.,"Unfortunately, Treasure Box follows the predictable character development that Card has routinely created in past efforts. The main character's central philosophies are explored and established only to match them up with the character's identical twin. Unfortunately, this gets to be very boring after several hundred pages. Card would do better by steering clear of this bland formula and sticking with the grand themes that make efforts like the Ender trilodgy so effective."
1,Horror isn't Card's forte,"I bought this based on my enjoyment of Card's SF novels. Unfortunately, this book was a real disappointment for me.Card starts off the book OK building up his protagonist, Quentin. But then Card seems to drag out the character development, to a point where I nearly stopped reading the novel. What was I reading here, some kind of maudlin slice-of-life for a guy with emotional baggage who caught it insanely lucky in the dot-com boom? Oh, he found someone to love. Whoopee.By the time things start to go odd for Quentin, I was up to my eyeballs in boredom. The next part was about Quentin trying to figure things out, but that wasn't very ghostly, and certaintly wasn't very suspenseful. Oh, my, Quentin figures that he's up against a powerful enemy. Yawn.The ending was as climactic as it could get for a boring book. When I read a horror novel, I want something that at least gives me the creeps. I've had more horror from filling out tax returns than reading this novel."
1,"I am a big OSC fan, but this one disappointed me","Unless you are an avid Card fan, I don't recommend this book. The story is cliched, and all the characters (except Quentin) are too shallow to care about. And the resolution of the conflict at the end is pretty dumb.I like OSC books, but this one was disappointing."
4,Solidly entertaining and internally consistent fantasy,"If you like a good ghost story, you'll love this romantic and spooky tale. The hero, Quentin Fears, achieves wealth easily, early in life; the rest of the story is about his search for meaning and a love interest who can compete with his idealized sister, who died as a young teen.Quentin finds himself drawn into a life of magic and supernatural power, with no preparation or information, and is forced to sort out reality from deceit and magical glamor. Luckily, he's gotten very good at judging character as a do-it-yourself venture capitalist.I found the story compelling but not terribly deep. It doesn't drag and keeps the reader eager to know how Quentin is going to resolve his situation.Take this book on vacation for sheer entertainment value!"
4,SOMEONE TELL MR. CARD TO DO MORE LIKE TREASURE BOX,I GENERALLY DON'T LIKE SCIENCE FICTION. (I DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE SCIENCE FICTION READERS CAN HOLD A HARDBACK WITH ONE HAND AND READ) I SUPPOSE THAT THE PUREST MIGHT SAY TREASURE BOX IS NOT REALLY SCIENCE FICTION - WHO CARES... THIS WAS GREAT! I HAVE TRIED OTHER CARD BOOKS BUT THEY'RE NOT MY UP OF TEA. I KNOW CARD CAN WRITE WELL. I 'LL KEEP LOOKING FOR ANOTHER LIKE THIS ONE. TELL NON-SCI/FI READERS TO GIVE THIS ONE A TRY.
4,Keeps you interested,"This book had twists and turns that were never expected. I did not know it was a horror until I got further and further into it. I must say, it was difficult to put down because it was fairly confusing and I needed to see an explanation and also needed to see what happened next."
3,A quick pleasurable read with good plot twists.,I am a loyal OSC reader and thoroughly enjoyed this book. In this book Mr. Card opens up the afterburners and doesn't look back. This book doesn't get bogged down like some of his SF novels. I especially enjoyed the eerie quality of the novel. I hope Mr. Card writes more of these types of novels as they are a nice diversion from his normal novels.
4,well crafted,"Like all of Card's books I have read (around 10), this one is very well crafted. The character development is full, with a richness that only he brings to a novel. The story is well written and strong. It never plods along, but moves quickly, though it doesn't rush."
1,Dreck,"How this man managed to get published once boggles my mind! Much less book after book. All we need to know about what is wrong with publishing is to read a book like this. It is infantile, uninspired, amateurish writing of the worst kind."
3,An Entertaining Read,"You know you'll never go wrong with a Card book. They're all entertaining. The first 20-30 pages of this book are enchanting. I couldn't put it down. It was entertaining the rest of the way, but not at the same level.The climax of the book is rushed, Card compresses it into 20 pages leaving the reader a little shell-shocked. Tension and mystery build..and then it's all over. Not a great book, but a decent read."
4,"If I were a woman or gay, I might have a crush on Card.","I'm not a woman and I'm not gay, so I just love (in a purely platonic way) Orson Scott Card's writing. This is a very good one. The main character is just plain interesting, and the book feels so heartfelt. The characters and events seem so real, but then... they're not. It's kinda disturbing, but also exhilerating. Kind of a horror/mystery novel, but also is a story about a man who seems so real in an unreal world. It is truly memorable, especially if you like character development."
2,"Starts well, then dies.","Orson Scott Card is one of the most gifted authors currently working. For a great example of his style read the first part of this novel. Then put it down, because reading the rest of it will change your mind. The buildup in this book is phenomenal. The scenes that take place in a gothic mansion populated by ghosts rank with some of the best work he has ever done. Why then does he throw all of this away for the sake of a plot twist that delivers nothing? Once the antagonist becomes nothing more than a powerful child the book looses it's beauty. It has no suspense, no fear, no style. It becomes a potboiler more suited to a mass market hack then a gifted artist. His first major non science fiction novel, Lost Boys, is one of the best American novels of the last 20 years. I cannot read it without crying. That book was a great work. This is not. The best thing about this novel is that the memory of it will fade quickly, and therefore, do little damage to his legacy,"
1,Near-solipsistic failure of a novel.,"I like most of Card's work, but this book was a total failure of an attempt at the thriller/horror genre. I wanted to like the main character, a Silicon Valley guy like me, but just couldn't get into him or any of the other characters in the book. Card also shows terrible handling of the supernatural here; I don't know if it is his Mormonism interfering with writer's judgement (don't know much about Mormonism) but he takes a ""ghost story"" way beyond the conventions of a localized phenomenon and into solipsistic absurdity in which the witch antagonist manipulates all of reality with ludicrous Godlike powers over thousands of miles. I truly admire Card as a writer, but he should have left this book in the Box. The one in his basement that never gets opened, that is."
2,Almost as bad as LOST BOYS.,"Orson Scott Card is one of my most favorite authors and, in the past, I have purchased his books without even reading the back cover because I felt assured that nothing he wrote would be dissappointing. No more. Treasure Box's paranormal slant seemed poorly developed and abruptly ended - as if he weren't quite sure how to flesh-out the rest of the story. The characters also seemed to lack the depth that I have come to expect from Card's stories. In my summary above, I stated that TREASURE BOX was almost as bad as LOST BOYS, and I still feel that LB was worse (i.e., too many sub-plots, abrupt ending). However, I empathized with the core family and their daily struggles. I cannot say the same for anyone in TREASURE BOX. :-("
5,Very Unique,"The world needs writers who have the imagination like Mr. Card. I thought this was a beautiful and engaging story. I thought it was funny, creepy, a bit sad and had a suprising twist at the end. This is a book I would readily read again and share with others. Thank you Mr. Card for your imaginative themes and ideas."
3,Page-turner that left me disappointed.,"Since I have read several of Card's works and enjoyed all of them, when I picked this book up off the library shelf, I got something quite different from what I bargained for.I have to admit that it book was an absolute page-turner- I could scarcely put it down to Skype with my fiancee when she called, and then I ended up staying up until 1:30am to finish it. However, when I got to the end of the book and reflected back on it, I realized how little of value was in the book. I felt very let down- it did nothing to encourage me to reconsider the world- it was a similar feeling to watching several hours of cheesy soaps... my time was wasted.If you want to read Card, Read the Ender and Shadow series. Even ""A Planet Called Treason"" with all its oddities was more thought provoking than this book."
3,Brevity can be a good thing,"It was a little slow getting into, and the characters are completely unbelievable. But the storyline was still compelling, and by the time it reached its climax it had me on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I think I'm glad I listened to an abridged version, it kept the story very compact and engrossing - it was more of a really good short story than a decent novel, and it could have been pared down even further and still retained the ambiance and core tale.The only thing that really bothered me was the very, very, very end. There was a paragraph or two at the end that was preachy and sappy and annoying. It could definitely been cut off, and detracted from an otherwise strong ending."
3,Not up to Card Par,"I am an avid OSC reader. Have been for years. Was surprised when I found this book on Amazon. Really excited to receive and read. Huge fan of Ender books, Worthing books, Alvin Maker series. If you are too..... steer clear of this one. Not up to OSC's usual impeccable quality. Oh well, can't bat perfectly."
4,Another page turner by Orson Scott Card,"Before reading this book, the only other Orson Scott Card book I had ever read was Ender's Game, which was by far the most entertaining science fiction book I'd been exposed to. In Treasure Box, Orson Scott Card places the fantasy/sci-fi genre aside and writes a tale that combines a supernatural/horror storyline with Card's mastery at plot-weaving. The story is at once a moving one, with the traumatic death of the main character's beloved sister. Then the author takes you on a journey that is a love story, a ghost story, a mystery, and a horror story all wrapped up in one easy-to-read package.This book was definitely entertaining and engaging, and would be perfect for a plane flight or rainy day."
1,Marketing for the snowmen products,"I recently saw a line of ""Mitford Snowmen"" products at a Hallmark story and figured out...ah ha! so that's the purpose of this bit-o-nothing book! To market another line of products! The Mitford series has lost its appeal for me now; if only the author had as much integrity as her characters."
3,Cute but too short,"I would like to build a snowman right now, lack of snow though. The cost of the book though wasn't worth the small effect it had on me. Not worth it at all. I am new to Jan Karon and I just purchased some more of her books, but now I'm hoping I didn't make a mistake. Illustrations are cute and nice to look at, but the overall point to the book, way to short, I blinked my eye and was done with it."
1,The Mitford Snowmen,"This book was such a disappointment. I am a Jan Karon fan. But, I thought this book was a real effort to sell the public an item with no substance. Thank goodness I caught this book coming across the desk at our library and checked it out before buying it. Each year I buy a Christmas book to add to our family's collection, but this is not one I want. I loved the cover and the darling illustrations, but for me there was no story!"
4,Favorite Christmas stories,"A quick read for adults and children who enjoy this delightful time of year. Set on Mitford's main street this impromtu snowman contest brings out the best in all involved including the self-appointed judge.Enjoy this short book with a neice, nephew, child, or grandchild."
2,Too short for the money.,"I have read all of Jan Karon's Mitford books and have LOVED them. This one, however, was not worth the price. It was shorter than a magazine story! Please, get back to the real books!"
1,Just a tiny taste of Karon,"Although the cover illustration on this hardbound edition is quite cute, the size of the book (5 inches by 6) and the amount of story line (about 14 out of 23 small pages) sadly leave much to be desired. Also, the illustrations throughout (although also rather cute) take up too much space and can be rather distracting for a novel reader. I have read 5 of Jan Karon's Mitford Series books and this one is not part of that series by any stretch of the imagination. It's too tiny and probably was only meant to be read to a tiny tot."
3,Disappointed in Mitford,"I was extremely disappointed with the length of the Snowmen story. It was so short (23 pages including pictures) that it seemed to never be more than an idea or glint in the author's eye. It was a cute idea that needed a lot more than just cute pictures to go anywhere. I think it took me 2 whole minutes to read it. All in all, I could have spent my money on a real book."
2,Not even worthy of being a book...,"I could type the entire book in this section and save you the trouble of checking it out, but I won't, because that would be copyright infringement. But this book is less than 1000 words. There isn't even a moral to the story - it's just a story about several of the Mitford residents building snowmen in front of the stores on Main Street. This is SUCH an obvious attempt to milk the Mitford series for more money without having to actually write another novel. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I wasn't expecting a long story, but I was expecting something to happen! Philip Gulley writes short stories in all of his books and each of them have a meaning or moral and most aren't that much longer than this book. Seems to me that it would have been easy enough to write a short story with a moral or lesson, but alas, no. Read it IN the library - don't even bother checking the book out."
4,A Light Snack!,"Truly more of a greeting card than a book, the 23 page story is a charming holiday glimpse of our Mitford friends and the joy of an impromptu snowman building contest. And if you have priced cards recently - the value is good! The writing is charming, the illustrations a delight - but don't expect more than a light snack - this is NOT one of the lovely, lengthy Mitford novels. It would be a perfect hostess gift or a little something for one of those people who have everything. If you want something more substantial, a new Mitford book is promised for July, IN THIS MOUNTAIN (which Amazon is kindly allowing us to preorder!)"
4,The illustrations are worth the price of this book!,"Although Donald Hough has done this story in the book, The Cocktail Hour in Jackson Hole (to a degree anyway!), I have to say that visiting Mitford for 10 minutes at Christmas time was worth it!! Imagining my old friends building snowmen and snowwomen and adding pieces and parts of themselves, took me back to my own childhood.....<sigh>The illustrations are fantastic!!! In a day and age when retro is ""in"" it was comforting to see the twinkling, old-fashioned illustrations.This book makes me smile...."
3,35 Cents A Page?,"A story better be awfully good, to be 35 cents a page!I don't believe this book accomplishes that. To be sure, it is a warm and touching story of non-competition for the fun and community and comradeship of it. This is to be applauded and passed on. But one wanders, especially this reviewer, if for this most precious time of the year, one's thoughts (even Mitford's and especially Fr. Tim's) should be focused more on nativity scenes and not winter wonderland scenes.There certainly is nothing offensive in this work. But 23 pages for the price? One thinks the marketing with Hallmark is over-dominant here.Having thoroughly enjoyed Karon's previous works in this series, this was a letdown. She can do better."
1,Not for people who aren't Mitford fans.,"Don't bother with this if you've not read the Mitford books before. I haven't (to be honest, I'd never even heard of them) and read this because I was looking for something Christmasy. What a waste. The pictures were...nice?, but there was no story to speak of. I have no idea who the characters were, what they were talking about, or why I should care.I can't speak on whether this is worthwhile for people who do enjoy the Mitford books, but be warned that this story would probably fit on one single-spaced typed page, so don't expect too much."
3,"Cute, seasonal short story",It was a cute seasonal short story in the traditon of the Mitford Series by Jan Karon.
1,Delicious dessert??,"This book bills itself by saying 'if you find the Mitford novels a feast, you'll find the Mitford Snowmen a delicious dessert.' That may be true but this dessert barely filled my back tooth. The type in the book covers 4' x 3.5' of the page and there are only 23 pages to the book! Of those 23 pages, 14 have type with the remaining being graphics designed to sell greeting cards. Of the 14 with type, 5 also have graphics and two are half pages. Skip the book and, with the money you save, buy yourself a real dessert."
1,Can't make a snowman out of SLUSH!,"Mama mia! I cannot believe one single soul( considering the number of people it takes to get a book into print and on the market) in the Jan Karon corner (including Jan herself!) did not have the honesty to say, ""This isn't worth the paper it's written on.""Did the publisher actually think the fans of Jan Karon would accept such a...a...book? story? whatever? just because her name was on the cover??????I thought after the disappointing WEDDING STORY (everyone is entitled to a ""mistake"" in judgement now and then) Karon's next tale would be on the caliber of BACK HOME IN MITFORD. This only goes to prove that even a good author and a very distinguished publishing house does not equal a good book.Shame, shame on all those involved in the biggest sham this holiday season! Surely many of their Christmas ""stockings"" will be full of coal this year. Coal and slush!Terry, a very disappointed reader"
3,A display book,"OK - here's the deal. This is a cute little book that tells about a nice little snowman-building contest in Mitford. The moral of the story - don't be too busy during the holiday season that you can't stop everything to be spontaneous and have a little fun. That's it. A nice moral. The illustrations are cute and the book will look nice standing up on a shelf, surrounded by the cute little resin Mitford snowmen that a well known card store is selling. (Which, is the other reason for this book. If you are going to sell snowmen to go along with the current snowman craze, why not write an explanation about why you are selling ""Mitford"" snowmen when, in fact, snowmen have not been mentioned in the Mitford books before. I don't think.) So enjoy the book for a little fluff. Put it out on a shelf during the holidays to remind yourself to be spontaneous and have fun. And don't try to compare it to a regular Mitford novel. It wasn't meant to be one."
3,What? What? Whaaaaa?,"What happened here? Jan is usually (Always) very on the up and up. The plot is the problem, there is none. It just goes to show even the best have bad days. The character is also very weak here, I wonder if someone else really did not write this? Hmmmm...Recommend reading SB 1 or God by KARL MARK MADDOX"
1,"Consider yourself ""snowed"" if you purchase this book!","DO NOT, under ANY circumstances, WASTE your hard-earned dollars on this bit of nothingness! I rarely find a book unworthy of my time, but this one earned that distinction. There is no moral, there is no plot, it does not qualify as anything more than an advertisement for the series of Mitford Snowmen collectibles!"
1,Disappointing,"I am probably the biggest Mitford fan in the world. I love all of the books in the series, but The Mitford Snowmen was a huge disappointment. The plot was very loose-ended. A snowman building contest starts, but Karon doesn't tell us HOW it got started. The characters are totally undeveloped, so we lose that ""down-home"" sense that has made Mitford so popular. Even the illustrations are disappointing. The only illustration worth looking at was the one of the snowmen--which is the only page worth the one star I gave this book. Very disappointing."
4,No more fingerprints on the iPad screen,Neat little product that can clip on to the iPad cover and also the headphone jack for holding. Using the stylus avoids all the fingerprints on the screen. A bit expensive for what it really does but it works.
3,Awesome until it broke!,"As a relatively new iPad user, my right hand began to ache from pointing at things on my iPad screen. I have arthritis in my right hand and the stylus helps prevent some of the pain. I like the styling of this product and it appeared to be well made, but after one month of use, the black tip fell off and won't stay on the stylus."
3,Not What I Expected,"I thought that the rubber (?) end was simply a cover that hid a pen-like attachment. I was wrong and the rounded rubber end is the stylus itself. Not very useful for what I wanted, but I am sure it does fine."
1,Nicely made but fingers do a better job. Look elsewhere for precision.,"Carlos R ""Chinito77"" (DC Metro Area) did the best review (with two stars). Please refer to that. [IMHO it should have been 0 or 1 star as 2-3 stars - we rarely read]I am going to return this after a week of usage on iphone and ipad.The most frustrating part is it misses some depressions - how can you sell such a product for data input - even Speech Recognition runs in 90+ % hit rate these days. If stylus does 50-60%, it better be called ""Stylus - Yuck!!!""."
1,TERRIBLE PEN,I bought this pen to take notes on the ipad. It is horrible and does not work. I can barely write two letters with it. Horrible.
1,Waste of money,"This is a strange product. I read huge amount of articles about the stylus, and which one is the best, and everyone was bragging about this product. I got it 3 weeks ago, and since then I have only used it once, and think it is absolute garbage to be honest with you. It is very strange using it with IPad. Ipad was designed to be used with your fingers, and using a stylus seems impractical. I will not recommend it at all."
4,Great if you need to write or draw with an iPad,"I purchased this stylus after I bought Notes Plus for the iPad. Honestly thought I'd left the days of styli behind with my Palm Treo, but have found it very natural and comfortable to write on the iPad with this stylus. The tip has just enough give and resistance.I use the clip on the stylus to attach it to the outside of my iPad case. The stylus also has a small loop of string attached with a plastic ""plug"" that you can slide int the headphone jack to keep it from falling away. I tried it but feel a little hesitant to use that feature out of feat that it might break off while inserted.My only small complaints have to do with the length (another inch long would have suited me better) and weight (it's very light and I prefer a little heft to a pen) - still a huge improvement over the tiny styli of days gone by."
4,It works,"I'm typing this review with the stylus and going quicker than i would with my fingers. I've tried using it with games, web browsing & graphics programs, and except for one game, I like it better than my fingers. I have small hands, and even i agree that it's a bit short - I also find it a bit thicker than the pens and pencils I usually use, but it still gets 4stars. It always works - not something the Pogo always did. The firm point is much better than the foamy ones, and I love that the little thether thing makes it harder to lose. Not that I won't lose it, so I'm going to order another one."
3,Don't like for the Nexus 7,"The quality of the stylus is well crafted, however when using on my tablet I find that for some reason there are sensitivity issues. Primarily when attempting to use the stylus to navigate around on web pages or to use to type, different pressures cause unexpected things to occur as if I am lifting up on the pen and placing it on the tablet again. This can be very frustrating when attempting to swipe on the keyboard. Example: This is as test to demonstrate problems who've attempting to usea adults on the Nexus 7 keyboard while swyping."
1,faulty product,I had high hopes for this stylus and thought it was good until I used it. I noticed a thread of the tip material sticking up and inspected the stylus better. Mine felt very rough to the touch which I do not believe will be good on my expensive Ipad and Iphone And the tip seems to be coming apart. NOT happy but at least I can return; still such a hassle for a small purchase. I will need to keep searching for a safer option.
5,Awesome,"I have tried several styluses (styli?) for the iPAD and this is far and away the sturdiest, most comfortable one available. It comes with an attachment to plug it in to the audio out port, which makes it harder to lose. For me this is very important. All capacitance styli for iPad have a broad footprint, required for the screen to sense them, but this baby works at a normal pen angle and is quite precise. Simple, sturdy, elegant, comfortable and highly functional design. What more can I say?"
4,Not too bad,"We got two different types of Stylus to try out. This one is comfortable to use & works without too much pressure needed. With ""control"" functions (sliders, etc.) it works well & writes & draws probably as well as any others we've tried - trouble is it still tends to be a little clumsy and write too ""thickly"" to use too efficiently. Still the best tried so far."
3,Why does it cost so much?,"I ordered this product on Oct 18 of $17.95, it arrived on Oct. 21, and I whent to write a review I noted that the price dropped $3.00. Judging by the look of the product received, I wondered why the original price was so high. Amazon has a similar product, which they sell for 3 for $1.60. Knocking the price for this single one down to $15.00 is but a mini-step in the right direction. I called Amazon cs, and while they can give a return authorization, they could not credit my account for the lower price a week after it was purchased. I have to return it (at my cost) and reorder if I still want the product.As to the quality of the product, there is not much to say. While it is priced as if it was a Mont Blanc pen, it looks low tech and simple. It realy seems too small to handle. The little tail sticking out of the top was unexplained by the label, but it apparently sticks into the 3.5mm jack on the top of the Ipad."
3,Could be better,"The stylus doesn't work perfectly; at times, you can be pressing the iPad with it and the iOS won't respond. I have had to adjust how I hold the device in order for it to work. In addition, it is smaller and lighter than I expected. I have very small hands, and I would assume that a person with normal or large hands would find it difficult to use the stylus."
1,It is not sensitive to the screen,You need press hard to write and it is not sensitive. The top rubber is too big and not easy to write.
3,Works fine,"The Boxwave stylus works fine. My issues with it are just a matter of preference. This stylus is very light, and the small metal ring and string at the top for storage rattle a little. It's very useful to have the string as it carries the little plastic wedge for connecting the stylus to the ipad for storage (the plastic wedge fits into the audio jack opening).My personal preference is for the Kuel stylus. It is a little heavier, is collapsible to half its length, and the storage wedge is on the removable cap. The downside of the Kuel stylus is that it is easy to lose the cap.Both write equally well in my opinion."
3,Not for Me...,"I really wanted to replace my trusty pen with this stylus, but alas my pen remains. Whilst it is of reasonable quality, the stylus is too small and the fat rubber tip is too big and floppy. It just doesn't feel like a pen, it is more like an uncomfortable extra finger that does not leave finger prints over your touch screen.Overall: Too Small to be useful, on the upside no messy finger printsWhere is it now? In my desk drawer, with all the other discarded stuff."
4,i bit cheap,The actual pen feels cheap. But it seems to work o.k. i love the tip it glides . But i will give it a try.
4,Smooth Grip,"This was a gift for my husband. I was a little skeptical but he reviews every single item and found this to be the best! He loved it from the word, go! Once I used it on our iPad, I was quite impressed with it, too. I love that the stylus is rounded and cushy at the end instead of pointed like most."
3,Lasted about 6 mo,"Not sure how long I expected this to last, but after ~ 6 mo the rubber tip began to oxidize and break down leaving a residue on my ipad screen and gradually becoming much less accurate due to the loss of physical properties of the rubber tip. I thought it was a problem with the ipad at first, but when I used my finger in place of the stylus everything worked great.My approach in the future will be to buy the cheapest stylus available and replace it every few months. Or maybe I will just keep using my finger, as I don't expect it to wear out any time soon..."
2,Poor,Lasted a month. The tip is too soft. Bangs against glass after only a month. Disappointed. Better products out there.
3,Box Wave Stylus Review,"Not quick what I expected. The writing tip could does not really allow for precision or maybe I am just not using it properly, I which case, some detailed instructions would have been very useful"
3,Mixed results,"I used one of these for about 5 months before the tip came off. I thought 5 months of daily use was a pretty good value, so I bought the same type as a replacement. Unfortunately, my second one only made it about a month before the tip worked loose. I never carried it in a pocket or briefcase; it just came loose from basic use on a tablet. So, the 3 stars reflects both my satisfaction with the first one and my dissatisfaction with the second one. As a replacement this time I'm buying a multi-pack of a different brand."
3,"okay, for price if still $10","I've tried three different styluses now - a Targus, this BoxWave and the Kuel stylus.The Kuel H10 had the best feel. It's retractable and has decent heft, but the cap lost it's hold after only a week.The Targus was fine, as was this BoxWave, though the size of the BoxWave tip was so large that it was quite hard to tell where exactly the connection was -- it's only slightly better than a finger tip. For $10, it's fine."
3,So - so,"Its not as flexible as writing with a pen on a paper. At the same time, its not that bad. So I give it a review of so-so."
1,Stylus,"Stylus does not last, rubber tip comes off very easy, cannot be replaced, save your money.Will not purchase again, so much for a 4 star rating."
5,Excellent,"Like others have said before me it's expensive. The body of the stylus itself is hollow, which I suppose is a good thing if it clanks against the iPad screen it will not break it. The little plastic piece on the end of the string fits snugly into the earphone jack. I would recommend they lower the price a bit or sell them in multiple packs but it works great."
5,Terrific Capacitive Stylus,"I read many reviews on the web looking for a good stylus to use with my drawing apps (ArtStudio, Sketchbook Pro, Draw Cast) and finally chose this product. It has made all the difference in using these apps to their fullest. For my purposes, this little stylus is perfect! I use it daily and it has not shown any sign of wear or decrease in responsiveness. I have small hands, so the size is actually comfortable. I like how it keeps smudges off the screen, and is less fatigue on my hand than finger swiping or tapping. I also use this with Penultimate. In addition, it make game playing (such as time management or HOG games) much easier. As with any of the styli that clips to the device via the headphone jack, it's important to have a screen protector to keep from scratching your device, if you do use this feature."
3,Good when works,Perhaps I am too hard on this stylus as they never seem to work for more than 1 Month. Price is good though so just buying 3 at a time next time.
3,Good for general use,"I purchased this with the thought of taking down notes in meetings. The tip is not as fine as I had hoped, so using it for note taking was out. In general though, it has been good for just replacing my finger in terms of general use of the tablet. If you want to have a stylus to take down written notes (using lecturenotes app), get one with a finer point. If you want a stylus to use so that your fingers wont have to get out of gloves, this is great."
3,"Best iPad stylus yet,","I own two styluss (styli?) for the iPad. This is by far the best as the pad on the end doesn't move around. Still not precise enough for my liking but i think this is down to the iPad and which isn't designed to use a stylus. So the net is i don't use it often enough as i wanted to use it for writing notes, however great as a finger replacement for more general work including art."
5,Boxwave Pen is the best!,"I've used several different type of capacitive pens for my iPad. This Boxwave is by far the best, most responsive one I've found."
5,Awesome !!!!,"This is one stylus that definitely delivers on quality! It is so much neater, cleaner, and smoother than using a finger. One thing I have noticed though is that it wears out over time; however I do get about one years use out of each one I order. The string attachment to the I-pad is a definite advantage on keeping track of the stylus. Excellent choice by far!!! BoxWave is the best!!"
2,Wore hole through mesh,"It worked great for the 6 weeks I could use it. The mesh part began to get thin and then a hole was finally worn through to the rubber tip (there is a picture of the start of this wear). It was not useable at this point as the stylus would register on the iPad with only very, very firm pressure, if at all.If I had written a review soon after my purchase it probably would have been five stars like so many others. I'm sure that is what the company is betting on so people like me will purchase the stylus not knowing the lack of long-term durability. I'd like to see all the five stars follow up several months after their purchase to see if their five stars still stand.Very disappointed, will not purchase again or recommend."
4,I love it.,"Very nice product, purchased for my mom to help her use her new mini iPad. She uses it and enjoys it"
3,"OK, but I wish the connector was longer","Pretty nice, but I was the connecting wire was longer so I wouldn't have to take it out while I use it."
4,BoxWave Capacitive iPad Stylus (Jet Black),"Got this article for my iPad and just love using it. The rubber tip is great and accurate for bigger fonts or objects on the screen. Accuracy drops when touching smaller items. Length is perfect for small hands like mine but wonder whether it is not a tad short for bigger hands. Am wondering what happens with prolonged use - will rubber tip shrink towards the side used more often and if so, can it be replaced? Anyway it is such a useful thing to have especially if not used to typing.BoxWave Capacitive iPad Stylus (Jet Black)"
2,Too short to use comfortably as a pen,"I purchased this to take notes on my iPad.While the tip is effective on the iPad, the length is simply too short to use comfortably. I wish Amazon would list the actual dimensions of the product rather than the box.Why manufacturers think people want stubby little styli is beyond me.TheAcase 2nd Generation Apple iPad / iPhone / iPod Capacitive Stylus (Metallic Silver) Newest ModelI also purchased is much better and feels like a real pen."
3,Needs a better point,Not sure why all of these things have such rounded points. Works OK for what it is which is an overpriced stylus. Will someone PLEASE figure out how to build one of these with an actual point on the end - its like writing with a marble glued to the end of a pencil.
1,The Honeymoon is Over,"Loved this stylus when I bought it at the end of April. Now, the tip is very soft and squishy and its screen and pressure sensitivity are gone. It's starting to skip when I use Upad, a great handwriting app. I rarely use it on a phone so it has not been abused.I was so pleased with this stylus after having used a POGO, I neglected to mention in my first review that the plug to attach the stylus to the IPad was plastic. A cheap and dumb choice. I won't risk it breaking off in the earphone port.So now, after almost 2 months, I advise againt this purchase Too pricey for a short handwriting life. Thumbs down."
1,Great stylus while it lasted!!!!,"I liked the stylus when the tip was properly attached to the shaft of the pen. The rubbery tip came off only after a month and a half of daily use. I would use the stylus for browsing, writing notes, and navigating. Nothing vigorous enough to cause the tip to brake off. I email the company to see if I could reattach the tip but received a response stating ""we cannot reattach the stylus tip."" They did offer me a 15% discount on another stylus (yeah right, like if I'm buying another crappy BoxWave capacitive). I'm very disappointed with the product. I thought I made an excellent decision when I bought it. I guess I'll try a different more expensive stylus and hope it lasts for more than a month and a half."
1,Tip Fell Off Within 4 weeks,"The tip of the stylus came off within 4 weeks of using it (not heavy use -- very light use, in fact).I have contacted BoxWave to see about a refund."
4,Beats finger painting for most uses,"For almost everything I do, this is better than poking at the screen with my digits. The stylus blocks less of the screen so is better at hitting small targets like links. For pecking on the keyboard, this is much faster than fingers. Sketches in penultimate, better. Less smudging = less cleaning.The only actions that need reverting to fingers: angry birds, and zoom.In case you're wondering: the little string and button at the top plugs into the headphone jack. A small clip lets you unhook the pen for use, and hook when carrying around."
3,BoxWave Stylus,"I don't know if it's just because I'm left-handed, but I have issues using this stylus. It appears the stylus has to be kept straight up and down or else it doesn't write. I've also had issues where it's erase something I'm writing as I'm writing it."
3,Crimson color is too pink!,"This is not a review about the quality of the stylus since I returned it before using it. I ordered Crimson and expected to get a true crimson red and instead got a very pinkish red (more like Rose which is another color they sell). So I returned it and purchased another thinking they just mixed up the colors on my first order. The 2nd stylus was exactly the same color so it went back too.I don't think its fair to give it 1 or 2 stars since I never used it, but the color in the listing is very misleading .. so maybe a lower review will get BoxWave's attention so they can fix this issue."
5,Love the BoxWave Stylus!,"Very nice stylus, instant activation with a light touch. I was unsure of the lanyard, but have grown to love it and I never lose the stylus. Others have noted that the tip wasn't holding up, that is not the case for us, seems to be very secure and long use to come."
3,Nice Stylus,"I like the stylus alright. I had hoped it would work with my Trackpad as well as my iPad, but the trackpad has slightly different touch sensitivity and it doesn't work as well there. It should be noted that it doesn't claim to work on the trackpad, I just wanted it to. On the iPad it works just fine. Better than some others I have used. I do prefer the White Stylus + Pen combo by the same company over this stylus as it is a little longer and feels more natural in the hand."
4,"Good Stylus, but not great","This stylus got the best reviews and was pretty inexpensive so i decided to give it a try for taking notes in class. It does its job, but i have to press down pretty hard when using which makes writing pretty awkward. the black bulb at the end is very... smooshy, for lack of a better word. The tip is huge so the only way to write (i am using it two write notes on pdfs) is to zoom in. Ill have to consider some different models in the future, but for right now this will do."
3,Incompatible with durability when used with some screen Protectors?,"These styluses are precise, fun to use, and in my view an essential tool. However there are not as durable as they appear to be. If you are using a screen protector such as the Zagg Invisible Shield, the word from the Boxwave company is that there is some indication from some users of early wear. If like me, you become dependent on this stylus, then you will need to buy a new one periodically when it stops sliding across the screen for handwriting and art making uses-the finish apparently gets worn down to the point where it no longer slides. My feeling is that the company should be doing internal testing and forewarn consumers if these are going to be worn down quickly. Of course the incentives for doing so are not very high right now, as once these are worn down and you are dependent on them, you will find yourself buying new ones every few months."
5,Does the job,"I can't compare this against any other capacitive stylus, so bear that in mind. However, this stylus performs like I hoped. I use it for writing with the Note Taker HD program, and it's easier than writing with my finger. No reason to think other ones are any worse, but this one does the job."
2,Too pricey for what it is...,"Works great for a little while, but after daily use for a couple of months, the rubber tip gets tacky and starts to stick on the glass and it doesn't glide so much. Buying replacements at $15 a pop is not cool. I've already bought 4 of them.Update (17 Sep 2011): After searching and searching for a cheaper alternative, I found the exact ones (minus the headphone dust cap and string) on eBay for $2. Yeah, it takes 2 weeks to arrive from China, but I can order 5 of them for $10. Had to take a star from my rating for being too pricey."
2,Expensive for such a cheap item,"Ouch, this thing should be priced at $3. or $4. not what they are asking. It works fine, but not worth the cost."
2,Boxwave capacitive ipad stylus,Not cracked up to what it is to be. Disappointing and costly. Seen better ones and reasoable ones at Bestbuy.
3,Loved it until the foam started to whither.,"The pen is a must have for any ipad owner. I'm just not sure this is the pen. It's over priced to begin with, but then even with it's convenience and ease of use it should be better manufactured.The foam tip on mine, started to crack and peel within 4 months of use. Without the tip - it's useless. I can't use it anymore so I can't say it was worth the $25 I paid."
2,It worked,"It worked for awhile, but the rubber piece came off. I was able to re-glue back on, but you can find other capacitive stylus for the same price. I used a few from 5 below or even big lots. Nothing much to them really. I did like the way it has the headphone cord for storage and keep dust out of the headphone jack."
2,not the one pictured,Item received was not the one pictured. Just an ordinary stylus not Box Wave ever touch capacitive. Very very disappointed
1,The dimensions are misleading,"The description gives a dimension of 7.7' - which I thought was the length. It is really only 3.4"" - just like the other styluses sold elsewhere."
3,Great but lasted only 1yr8mo.,Worked as well if not better than other customer reviews however it lasted only 1 year & 7 months before the rubber fell apart and rendered it unusable. I will try one more time and hope for a longer life.
2,"Good Micro-Knit, FiberMesh Stylus, Lacks Durability","Not all micro-knit, FiberMesh Styluses are created equal. What is different about BoxWave's EverTouch is that is almost as long as a regular ballpoint pen, which makes their handling very natural. My stylus glides on the iPad just as promised, and it is indispensable if you plan on using apps like Notability, Paper, and ProCreate. For those who bought Joy Factory's SmartSuit3 for their white iPad, you have to choose the silver metallic stylus. I gave this product 4 stars at first, but I have to knock it down by two stars, because it is not durable. The little peg that allows you to attach the stylus to the iPad's audio jack can crack. Also, the chrome ring that is right below the FiberMesh tip falls off after three months. Both of these durability issues are part of the product gallery."
4,Excellent.,"I've used several of these styli, and this is the best so far. The main thing is the length; it fits much better in the hand than the shorter ones. The clips are a bit useless, but oh well."
5,Mesh is best,"This stylus with the fiber mesh tip is a lot smoother than the other rubber type tips on others . This glides smooothly across the iPad screen and after a week or two doesn't show any wear. The tip is a good size if you like to use the stylus to tap all over the screen in place of your fingers.However, I was looking for a stylus that would make it easier to hand write notes in the notebook aps and this one does half the job really well! This fiber mesh tip is wonderful at gliding across the iPad screen, but the tip is a little too thicker than I was hoping for. It seems that none of these stylus have very thin tips, so for durability and smoothness of use, I am giving this product 5 stars for exceeding my expectations after working with a rubber tip stylus. I was concerned that it wouldn't have enough ""stick"" to scroll through screens, but it does just fine."
2,"Precision Decreased Over Time, Rubber Tip Dragged","About 3 months ago I ordered the Boxwave stylus simultaneously with the iPad 2 release. As a student, I was relying on my iPad 2 for all of my note taking. At first, I was somewhat impressed with the stylus, but I was confused by the rubber tip. The stylus performed for about a month, and then I began to notice that it wouldn't pick up on my hand-writing as well.Letters like ""C"" ""S"" and ""R"" began to show up as straight lines. I tested this on multiple applications, and the Boxwave stylus was just not registering. Now, 3 months in, the stylus is unbearable. Its rubber tip squeaks and stalls against my iPad, forcing me to constantly erase and redo my work. I'm not sure if the rubber tip has lost its finesse or not, but I'm through with this product."
4,Great,"after comparing this with the Acase stylus I find this to be much more responsive. The Acase has a smaller point so I thought it would be much easier to use, but it's not the case at all, this Boxwave turns out to be the more responsive design. With the Acase I find myself pressing hard to get it to register contact and the tip gets smooshed, the Boxwave barely requires any effort and it works. The one draw back is the length of this Boxwave design, it needs to be a bit longer to feel more like a typical pen or pencil."
3,"A nice tool, but not perfect","Okay, perfection is a myth, but what keeps this pen from being perfect in the sense of fulfilling my needs is that it is not as precise as I would like, which brings down other attributes like value and usefulness. It tends to smush and not always hit what it should when I click on links. Also, writing with it is somewhat awkward because of the overly smushy tip. For now, I have just given up trying the handwriting apps because I don't have the patience to try another pen. In spite of my issues with it, I do think it's a good product, and it has proved useful now and again."
4,It works great with my Kindle HD,"The Kindle screen is very responsive to this stylus and it feels very comfortable in the hand. It is also quite sturdy, unlike the stylus that came with the Kindle which got bent shortly after I received the unit."
5,Great For The IPad 2,"My wife got me this stylus and it arrived today. It's a great stylus and it works great for games like Farm Story. It also writes really well. I don't have to press to hard and that's a good thing. My wife likes it so much she's been using it more than me so far. I'm going to post a pic of it by my IPad 2. I usually don't write reviews but I'm so happy with this product I felt I had too. Plus it's red, need I say more!"
3,Stylus,"Item was received on time, but the longer lanyard did come apart. In other respects the item works as expected."
4,very nice stylus,"this is the first stylus ive every used for a tablet/phone and it works well, better than my finger, though it seems u have to touch twice sometimes. Dont know if that's me or the stylus."
1,"Not durable, poor customer service","When I bought my ipad2 I ordered this stylus in anticipation based on reviews. Ugg! Should have heeded the warnings in the negative posts. I did not use the stylus very much when it arrived largely because I don't take alot of notes and also found the lines a little on the thick side. I probably used it about 15 times but the tip literally fell off the day following the return period (about 35 days). I wrote boxwave and they initially responded by asking for a picture of the problem so that their engineers could make improvements. They asked for another picture following the first one and I complied but that was the end of it. No offer to replace the stylus or to refund the money. I now have a useless $15 metal stick. I don't understand why they didn't just replace it for what probably costs them $1-2 to manufacture unless this happens with some frequency. In any case, buyer beware. Look through the reviews, this is not an isolated incident."
5,Great stylus for iPad,"I am a medical student and use my iPad to take notes. Many others in my class also have an iPad and have used other products for their stylus. The general consensus as well as my opinion stands that this is the best one for iPad hands down! Unlike the pogo stylus (which many of my classmates purchased initially), the Boxwave writes very smoothly. It feels durable and looks professional. If you are thinking about getting a stylus for your iPad, I suggest getting this one."
3,not as depicted,It is far from crimson red. Closer to hot pink. I'm not pleased about that and I found the cables are of no use with my thrive ir an I pad. There are no spots to attach them.
3,"not bad, but there's better","For the price, this isn't bad. It's a good size, and the lanyard that plugs into the headphone port isn't so bad. (Although it loosens up after a short period of time.) But there are better out there. My main issue, with the iPad 3, I think the nib is too soft. It smooshes too much when you try to write. I've been using the Bamboo Stylus for the past few weeks, and it's much more effective. It's much pricier, but at the end of the day, I enjoy using the Bamboo Stylus, and can't go back to using this one."
2,OK product,"This stylus writes just fine, but the cons outweighed the pros for me. Downsides of it are that its short and more importantly, I couldnt see what I was writing. The nub, all though was the perfect amount of firmness for my writing style, was so fat and wide that I literally could not see what I was writing. I wouldnt suggest this stylus pen, all though it actually wrote fine. If you like Boxwave products, I would suggest the Boxwave Slimline stylus pen over this one."
3,BoxWave has poor customer service,"Purchased the BoxWave Capactive Stylus on April 16. Within a few days the keyring string attachment that connects the stylus to the earphone jack of my iPad 2 broke. As I did not want to return the item to Amazon because the item was still usable and it would cost more for shipping than I wished to pay, I emailed BoxWave who told me as I ordered it through Amazon, I would have to deal with them. I called Amazon who told me I needed to deal with BoxWave. I emailed BoxWave again and told them all I would like them to do is send me a replacement string attachment which hooks on with a simple ring. They have not responded to my second email. It seems to me that the attachment is just a small, inexpensive part to replace. A bit disappointed with their customer relations."
3,1 out of 4 went bad early,"I own 4 of these in various colors. One went bad after 3 months - the rubber tip disintegrated. The other 3 are fine.These feel ok in the hand, the precision of the tip is ok, basically everything about them is ok, with nothing special.I definitely would not pay a premium price for this stylus, as far as I can tell it offers no advantage over a generic brand.That said, it is well constructed (other than the premature tip issue I had) and looks attractive."
5,Love This Stylus,"Love, love this stylus, was very sad when my grandson decided to pull the black tip off of the pen. I immediately ordered another one from Amazon!!!"
4,Works well,"Bought the stylus for a signature capture app a couple weeks ago and it works well so far. It does a good job when tapping to launch apps or typing on the virtual keyboard. Signatures come through completely without gaps in the user's name. The string that attaches to the headphone jack is too short to be useful, but the stylus itself works well."
4,Great Stylus,Love this stylus!Quality and feel is as decribed. Recommended for anyone looking for a decent stylus for your iPad.
4,Boxwave IPad stylus,I purchased 2 - lost the first one for a short while before even trying it out.One seems to have a firmer cushion and is more responsive to the IPad. Even thoughthey are same product they are slightly different in response. I have not triedany other stylist brands. These get the job done. It took a bit of getting use tobut resulted in faster performance then writing with my finger.
4,Fiber Mesh Stylus is good,"Fiber mesh fabric will probably be what all stylus tips will be made of soon. It is far more durable, drags far less than the old rubberized stylus tips and it feels more precise. I also like the length of the Boxwave Evertouch stylus. It feels like holding a pen in my hand. It's an excellent stylus. In between uses I use the magnetized left edge of my iPad enclosed within its smartcover to hold the stylus instead of using the earphone jack attachments that come with it."
2,"decent, but does nothing to clean","Decided to get this stylus as it was one of the only ones listed that also 'clean' as you use them. The stylus works great as a stylus, but it does absolutely nothing to clean the surface. If anything it smears any oil/dirt around the screen. And this is a brand new one too. I think it would be fair to ask the seller how they can claim a wire mesh will clean a glass surface? I am very curious myself."
3,iPad stylus,"Very good product however the iPad itself does not work perfectly with all the stylus. However this is the best I think, comfortable while handle"
2,Not for taking functional notes,"This stylus is ok for just fun use in penultimate or other app. However, if you want to take serious notes in a meeting, or if you are a student- it's just not going to happen with this stylus. Its not responsive enough, that is you sometimes have to write a letter several times for the screen to ""read"" it. Also, it fairly difficult to write in small text as you would on a normal sheet of lined paper- realistically it will not happen. The writing tip is like an eraser and just doesn't respond absolutely to the screen. Cool to play around with though."
5,BEST pen I've owned,"I've had a lot of crap pens that require you to push WAY too hard to get them to register, but this one is as smooth as silk. The slightest brush on the screen will do. I am an artist and I like to use Sketchbook Pro to draw and it was frustrating to try and draw with my finger, and then the other lame pens made it worse, but this pen saves the day.Great pen, look no further."
5,Best iPad stylus I have used so far,"If you are looking for a great stylus for your iPad, you will not be dissappointed. The box wave stylus is smooth and responsive and writes on your iPad note taking app with the feel of a smooth writing pen. I have tried several other brands of stylus and most have felt ""rubbery"" , ""floppy"" or ""sticky"" on the iPad screen. The Boxwave stylus makes not only writing and drawing on your iPad easier and more fun but also makes navigation and typing easier.I will strongly recommend the Boxwave stylus for all discerning iPad users !"
4,Nice addtion for my iPad,"It works well with Penultimate on my iPad, although its length was a little shorter than expected/desired."
4,Great for iPad,"The stylus works beautifully. I use my iPad constantly and quickly tired of seeing the excess oil smears from fingerprints. Upon checking reviews and standing by the principle of ""you get what you pay for"" I decided to try this. Keep in mind, I have not tried the other stylus out there, but having started with this one I am content with it."
3,The pressure must be getting to me.,Keeping this short & sweet. Only just got this stylus so I can't comment on the durability. However I can say with certainty that it requires a notably higher pressure be applied than a normal rubber stylus.
5,Pen,I received the product on time and really like it. The product I received the same as it was described. I will order more to use as gifts.
5,More Durable Than the Pogo Sketch,"I bought a Pogo Sketch to use with my iPad and at first I was elated. However, I used the pen quite a bit with the Penultimate app. In a few weeks the tip had flattened to the point that metal was starting to scrape the screen. I then ordred this Boxwave stylus and realized that I had been eating hamburger before when I could have had steak. The Capacitive Stylus tip is much harder and will last many months (years) longer than the Pogo. The harder tip also produces less friction so it is much smoother. I have a Zagg protective screen on my iPad is it works great with it. It is kinda expensive, but in the end you'll be glad that you spent the extra money. One thing that I hope they will change is the length of the attachment cable. It is made for an iPhone (and not an iPad). One end snaps into the headphone jack as an anchor. It it were longer, it would be of great use."
3,"Nice, but too light.","My first impression of taking this out of the case is that I was going to drop it. It seemed too light for a writing implement, not heavy enough to stay in my hand. I thought this was just the nature of the beast but my husband picked up a Targus Stylus and -- even though it has the same tip -- the barrel is heavier and textured and easier to hold.The tip is excellent, though, and it works very well. It's the soft, rubbery kind of tip and I didn't feel like it was harming the screen of my iPad at all. I would have liked it had it only weighed a little more."
2,Tip bent to the left and looks like it could fall when delivered.,When I order something that is new I just want it to work and be in new condition when it arrives.. that's not too much to ask.
1,Horrible,When I bought the stylus it was the greatest thing I have ever used on my iPad ... everything flowed so smoothly. well it scratched up my iPad today twice... I will never be buying another box wave product again I have been through three in the last two months. All I can say is thank God I caught it in time before it damaged the glass any further! DO NOT USE THIS STYLUS!
3,Don't See a Difference,I don't see any difference between this stylus and the regular rubber tip ones. Quite a let down. The attachments are nice for this stylus though.
4,Finally found a great stylus!!,"After browsing for a new stylus for my first and only device, Kindle Fire HD 8. 9 device. I made many purchases for stylus, and found this one.... Way better then the black spongy black tips that i had purchased on here... It was epic failures on both of the purchase. Well now that i had this nifty new item that i am using for my new ""love"" it is way better :) So, I would recommend this nifty item to anyone"
3,Better tip for accuracy and control,"But I wish the stylus itself were thicker, after a half hour of note taking my hand starts to cramp. Make a fitter stylus with this tip and you will have the best product on the market in terms of true tablet handwritten notetaking."
3,Not worth the price,I bought this stylus based on the reviews that said it was the best stylus for the iPad 3. I'll start with the best features about it. It's wonderful that it has the clip that connects it to the iPad via the headphone jack. I have a case that does not have a place to store the stylus so that is a must for me. It does seem sturdy and well made. The durability will be determined over time.For the negatives: the tip is quite firm compared to the rubber tip stylus I was previously using. So much so that I feel it affects the responsiveness. I feel I have to press harder than usual to get the iPad to respond. I think this was a lot to spend for a stylus that does seem any more effective than the .99 cent one I was using. Time will tell whether greater durability will make it better in the long run.
4,Nice feel and smooth,"I just started to use this on my iPad and it is very smooth. The only thing that seems a little bit and maybe I just need to get used to it, But there seems to be maybe half second delay between the time I put the stylist down scroll and when it actually scroll."
4,Less finger prints,"Love this stylus! My wrist does don't hurt as much from using my finger and the finger prints were reduced by 90 percent. I hope my rubber top doesnt fall off. This pen is not as long as a normal pen, which I was expecting due to the company making a shorter version. I would not want it any shorter. I'm going to buy another one as a back up. They could lower the price, it's a little pricy for a pen w a rubber tip. I bought this color so I could easily identify it among my other pens."
2,BoxWave EverTouch Capacitive Stylus,"Stylus came apart, the long & Orange one fell off, Black one just fell apart, I really wanted it to work!"
1,Failure,I have several styluses and thought this one looked promising. I liked everything about it except that the top came off and would not then stay connected.
5,Great stylus!,"Works well with my nexus 7, the tip has give but you get used to using it lightly - better for the tip, too.I don't find the clips it came with very useful.Accurate enough to take physics and math notes (draw equations and diagrams and such) at lecture speed."
4,Solid,"People dont lie about the mesh tip, its seriously fantastic. I cant imagine using a rubber one again. The pen feels super solid, has great length too (i have big hands) and is pretty universal. Im constantly switching back and forth between my nexus 7 and my iphone, couldnt ask for a better stylus."
1,Substitution made without notification,The item that I originally ordered was substituted without giving me proper notification. I don't consider this to be good practice.
3,Works well with my iPad 2,"I got the red one. Basically it works as advertised. The material looks nice and durable. Its weight is ok -- a bit too light to my taste though. The tip is good and responsive, even though sometimes I need to apply quite high pressure. I think it's too small & too short to be able to use as a normal pen (around an inch shorter than a typical ball-point pen). And sometimes it produces annoying sound when I drag it while applying high pressure (this is perhaps because I have Zagg skin on my iPad... don't know for sure because I haven't try it without the Zagg skin.) The tip is also quite too big - almost the size of my finger's tip -- so what's the point to have a stylus if it's almost as big as your finger??? It would be better if the tip is smaller so that you can have more pen-like writing experience."
2,"Light & Flimsy, skip it.","This stylus is just way too light and flimsy cheapo for my tastes. It's a good deal at only $8--but not if you're never gonna use it. Upgrade to the one with the pen on the other end (but be warned that there isn't a place to put the pen cap). I finally ended up with the Wacom Bamboo stylus--smaller tip, balanced weight and a matte finish grip."
1,Too short,"This is about the length of those little pencils that are sometimes handed out to fill in forms. It's simply too short to use comfortable and precisely, which defeats the purpose. It might be usable for people with small hands; for everyone else, it's an uncomfortable waste of time."
4,Decent iPad stylus,"I bought this stylus mainly because it was low cost and I didn't want to invest too much in something I may not use for my iPad. It's proven to be much more useful than I anticipated. It can sometimes feel slippery on the iPad 2 screen and not be properly recognized, but that may just be dirt and oils on the screen.The clip that hooks into the microphone jack works well, and if you have a Smart Cover that is folded backwards, the stylus will stick to the magnets in it, rather than dangling and clinking on the back of your iPad.If you're looking for a stylus for your iPad but don't want to spend too much, this can't be beat."
3,Horrible for use with TF Prime,I tried to use this stylus with the TF Prime as I have heard it is a decent one. Unfortunately it does not work well at all for handwriting or drawing purposes which was my primary reason for purchasing it. It's decent for simple touch based use but even has a few issues with that.
4,"Works as expected, seems well made","I haven't had a chance to compare this with other stylus products, but it works as expected - I've had no problems with it 'grabbing' on the screen or being detected by the screen.I've only two minor issues:1. The tip is a little wider than I'd like making precise note taking a little difficult. Think of it like writing with a marker pen rather than a ball point.2. Since adding a screen protector to my iPad, it occassionally needs a little extra pressure to pick up a 'flick-to-scroll' gesture. Not sure I can really blame the stylus for this and its just something to get used to rather than a true problem.Finally, the construction seems pretty good and at the current (early Feb 2011) reduced price, value is not bad either."
4,"Excellent, but fragile","This is what I've been missing all this time for my iPad. But I can't give it 5 stars, because I have a couple of gripes:1. The tip is very soft (pleasingly, in fact), so unfortunately it's very easy to tear. I don't see a way of unscrewing it to attach a replacement tip, if one is even available.2. It's all METAL! I love the little plug for the headphone jack, but then it bangs against the glass screen or aluminum back, both which can be scratched by this pen. And since I have the iPad and the stylus usually together, I frequently drop the pen on the glass or set the iPad on the stylus on accident. To BoxWave: can't you add some rubber-like coating to this thing?On a good note, this works with any capacitive touch screen, i.e. most modern smartphones. So if you are careful not to scratch your device, this stylus is excellent."
3,"Cool, but will I use it?",I like to take written notes and with an iPad you need a stylus. I like the feel of this item when I write with it. The tip let's you hold it at an angle that is natural for the writer. I can see how the tip could get damaged floating around a computer bag though. I found a pen cap to place over it for protection and it seems to work.There is a funny little clip attached to the stylus that I couldn't understand at first. It seems that it must be used to tether it to the iPad when not in use. It fits perfectly into the audio jack port on the iPad... nothing in the package tells you this.My only problem with this item is in finding a suitable notes application for the iPad. If I can find one then I might actually use this stylus.
5,The best Investment ever,"I'm so glad I decided to get this stylus, it works great with my NoteShelf app, and it even works just for selecting apps or typing the on-screen keyboard keys, the stylus was shipped fast also, as I only had standard shipping , the only complaint would be the price tag, but I guess you are paying for the quality, but at least this quality was worth it."
4,"Great Pen, Better Value","I bought this pen to draw on my iPad and find it very comfortable and natural feeling -- the various attachments are just icing on the cake. My only complaint is I was hoping the longest attachment would be long enough so I could use the pen while attached -- and it's not (it does stretch, but not easily and so you can't move it around the screen easily). But with the natural feel, quality 'nib', great price and attachments, this is a wonderful buy. Now, if it were only magical enough to help me finish a drawing . . ."
1,Shipped wrong item,I was shipped the mini box wave stylus instead of the regular one...disappointing that I must go through the trouble of returning this and reordering the correct one for a simple $10 stylus
5,Great Stylus for Idea Documentation,Works as advertised - easy to get the thoughts from your head down on the iPad. I use the stylus with the Penultimate app on the iPad and it works great - both in writing words as well as drawing for additional support.Great purchase - I would definitely buy this again if / when needed.
2,Tip Falls Off,"Loved the feel of this stylus and its tip right out of the box. But after a few hours, the tip came off... and now it won't stay on. So disappointed."
4,Good Stylus,I've purchased a number of other styli and they have been workable but this is actually very nice to work with and feels like a real pen. I'm left-handed so having something that is regular pen-length is more useful to me.
1,Not a good product,I received this product about two weeks ago and just began using it. After two days of not very much use the mesh tip is already coming off. Very disappointing product.
2,Not great.,"I ordered this thing so that I could hand written take notes on my Fire. I find the tip to be too soft and squeeshy to emulate writing. I already have a finger print protective film on the display, so that is a non-issue. Therefor, this thing just sits, unused. I wouldn't buy one of these again."
3,Could be better,works ok but could be better. Some times it works with light pressure and some times you have to use a lot of pressure to get it to work. I would not buy this product again.
3,Generic Stylus,"Bought for my Galaxy Nexus phone. It's a capacitive stylus as the description states. Doesn't give you the precision like a fine point stylus would. Purchased mainly to play Draw Something, didn't help much. It's just okay."
3,Disappointed,"This was suppose to be fiber tipped. Turns out to be a cheap stylus in plastic. Went down to local store and found same stylus a much cheaper price, my bad I shouldn't have used these first before checking . So I paid the price but still using them."
2,Assembly,"The metal ring around the mesh tip fell off after a few days. I have glued it back on, and it seems to be holding, but this should not have happened. otherwise, OK. I like the lanyards that were included."
4,Much better thn previous version,Much more accurate than the last version. More pinpoint accuracy. Love the longer connector with the coil. Now I don't have to pt it down each time.
4,Works well,The stylus works as expected. I bought two as I am sure to misplace this small item. An easy item to use. Attaches to both the iPhone and the iPad.
5,No more Smearing!,"I saw the BoxWave stylus in an Amazon email and thought they'd be great for stocking stuffers for my iPad/iPhone family members. And they are! I gave one to my sister (blue), my husband (black) and kept the red one for me. We all love them and use them, rather than smudge and smear up our i-products. It's been since Christmas morning, so I cannot speak to durability past 2+ weeks - that's why there are no stars - but so far no problems. With the handy clip, they don't get lost and are right where you need them at all times!I also have several drawing apps and use the stylus as my pencil, pen or brush. It is a great tool.Terrific product!"
5,Best I Owned So Far,"I first bought a Pogo stylus and it worked well but the feeling of it when writing on the iPad was odd. So I read reviews on Amazon and found the BoxWave and it is night and day compared to the Pogo. The BW is more comfortable, more precise, much smoother than the Pogo. I highly recommend it."
3,disappointed,"as a stylus ,it works perfectly but build quality very poor already start to loose color after 1 month of use."
3,"Decent, but not great.","After testing this stylus for a couple of weeks, I can only rate it a so-so. It's lightweight and feels good in the hand (albeit, maybe a little too light), and has a nifty plug that fits into the headphone jack so you'll never lose it. However, it is not nearly as responsive as I'd like. I realize that it was only an $8 purchase, however, with the rave reviews it was given, I expected much more.There is a definite lag time between writing and it finally showing up on the screen. Also, it didn't always register my movements, which is disappointing when you look at everyone else's reviews. Perhaps I'm expecting too much, though."
3,You get what you pay for,"Two big complaints: 1) I ordered the ""Crimson Red"" stylus, but it is more of a fuschia color. If I had wanted pink, I would have ordered pink. 2) I've had it for 8 days, and the plastic piece that fits in the headphone jack is already broken.It still works, sorta...it just comes out really easily now. Since the main reason I ordered this one was for that feature, so I wouldn't lose the stylus, and since the stylus easily falls out and I'll probably lose it now, I'm pretty disappointed in it. But, I realize you can't expect much for $8."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,I lvoe this product! It is very affordable and works great with my iPad. It is compact and has a nice size... the accuracy is great! I've used the pogo sketch and this product works better for your everyday user.
2,Does not work well on iPhone,"I don't recommend this stylus as the tip is quite broad, but worst of all it does not always register on my iPhone 4S."
2,Tip Tears Easily,"I purchased 2 of these the first part of April. Both of them are ruined. I always tap lightly on my iPad, but both tips tore and are no longer usable. I paid $8.00 per stylus. I think that is rather expensive for approximately 6 weeks of use each. Today I just received from Amazon 2 more, each a different brand. They were only $6.00 per stylus. We'll see. I will let you know how those work out."
2,Back part keeps falling off and pen is too light,"The pen looks and feels nice, but it is too light for my taste. I like pens that are a little heaver and feel like real pens I use to write on paper.One very annoying aspect of this pen is that the back part keeps falling off. Hence, if I wanted to put this pen in the pocket inside my jacket, I would probably lose it. I do not like the overall quality and cannot recommend this pen."
3,good but not accurate,"I bought it for $8, and it immediately dropped to lower price. I think that the reason of the price decrease is: it can not be used to write or draw accurately. When I write quickly with it, the result is worse than just using a finger."
2,quality going downhill,I purchased this stylus for our first iPad2. It works real well and lasted 1 year. I brought one for our second iPad2 last month and the tip is already torn. Only lasted 1 month. I have to look for a better quality stylus.
4,Twins,Bought this and a Acase Apple iPad Capacitive Stylus (Jet Black) - they are the same. Buy the less expensive and save your money.
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent","I was hard-pressed to find a good pen for my iPad. I use it everyday for taking notes in classes and writing on PDFs. However, when the Apple Store sold me some Pogo stick, it was thin and flimsy. I promptly returned it and learned about this boxwave stylus. I tried it and loved it. I have been using it for some months now and it has not worn, scratched, or cut. The end is made of a round rubber like material that easily glides across the iPad glass (assuming no screen protector). The pen has a good weight to it, fits well in the hand, and writes beautifully. If you are completely sick of that Pogo junk, get this boxwave - its well worth the money.Overall, excellent product in every way. Probably best iPad stylus on the open market today."
4,Works Well,This stylus works really well and I recommend it vs. others I've tried.If I could recommend one thing it would be that there was a bit longer version.
4,Works with touchscreen netvertible,"I bought this for my Lenovo Ideapad S10-3T netvertible. The touchscreen is designed for finger touch and the spongy end of this stylus seems to work well. It may be a little small for large fingers, though. It takes a little getting used to but it is worth it."
2,BoxWave Captavactive Stylus,I recived this item as scheduled. Stylus works as descried. The one thing I find discouraging is that the cord that keeps it connected to the headphone port is EXTREMELY SHORT.It is only 1.8 inches long. Should be functionally long enough to USED WHILE PLUGGED IN. (Kindle fire)
3,"Functional, but nothing special","I had originally been shopping for a Wacom stylus, but all the reviews said that this BoxWave stylus was at least as good, if not better, and at $8, was a fraction of the price. I figured the price point was worth the risk, and placed the order. It turns out to be worth only about $8. It is functional, but there are times where the point-control (where the screen actually says you're touching it) can be off. I also don't like the way it feels in my hand. I was hoping for a solid hefty feel, but this stylus is very light-weight and just feels cheap.Still though, if you're just looking for an inexpensive stylus to use with your iPhone, iPad, or other such device, and you don't do much drawing or extensive note-taking, this could be a good solution for you. I am going to try the Wacom next, and hope that it is as good as the hype."
5,Worth it!,"There is really not much to say other than this stylus does exactly what it's supposed to do. Most people don't need a stylus for their tablets. I even felt kind of funny buying one. But my girlfriend LOVES drawing games, and this stylus has been invaluable for that.I've used this on iPad2, an Android phone, and an iPod touch. Works great on all of them.I like how using this prevents fingerprint smudging on the display."
3,"Okay, but not as responsive as I thought....","While it does the job okay, I am not completely satisfied with the BoxWave stylus. I bought it based on other user experience, but somewhat disappointed with it. I have a writing shield on my iPad, which may be contributing to the stylus needing to be pressed down a little bit harder than I would like. Plus, it makes this squishy (and audible) sound as you're ""writing."" Kind of annoying."
3,Okay but not great,"After reading a lot of really amazing reviews about this stylus, I decided to bite the bullet and try it out. It's okay... but I really wouldn't rate it much above the other small capacitative styli you can find on Amazon. It feels like it will last longer than the cheaper models out there, but I got this at the same time as a pack of 6 of the ""cheaper"" variety. Both purchases were the same price and out of the box had about the same usability. The BoxWave has more attention to detail (mostly) in that it has a metal clip and the finish isn't coming off. However, true to some of the other reviews on here, my stylus arrived with the tip unglued. A little super glue fixed it, but it was an unfortunate extra step.All in all, I like it but I was soured by the fact that I had to glue on the tip out of the box, and I don't feel like it is leaps and bounds beyond other comparable products on Amazon."
2,Doesn't work very well on my iPad,"This was the first stylus I purchased. I wish it worked better. But I have to press very hard & it still misses a lot. I have to have the click for the keyboard on & the volume turned on. It is very frustrating. The tip seems to last though. My second stylus works better as far as contact response goes, but the tip on the one I use is half torn off - indicates that I have to press more than I should. My finger works better sometimes. But you can't beat a stylus for ""art"" work."
2,Not long lasting,In less than a year with below average use the rubber tip cracked and the pen is useless now.Bought originally because of the length. I am surprised at the high rating.
3,"Average stylus, But well worth price.",This stylus is a good stylus it feels good. I've had times were i though it was a pencil and i was writing on paper with my iPad. The only problem is that it is fragile and i have had to get a few replacements.Pros:Feels goodcan attach to music portCon:Fragile
2,not that great,"This stylus was OK for tapping, but not for swiping or writing. I tried it out on my iPad 2, and it was hit-and-miss with the strokes it would communicate. I'm returning it. In addition, I didn't like the weight (too light), and the little ring thing at the top was constantly rattling against the stylus and flopping against my hand, which I found annoying. All in all, it is just an irritating design."
2,Got these before they went to microfiber,The rubber tips pulled off these very quickly. Only got a couple of months of use & don't feel these are worth them money. Get micro fiber devices
2,Didn't last,The rubber tips pulled off these very quickly. Only got a couple of months of use & don't feel these are worth them money. Get micro fiber devices
4,Super Stylus with one reservation,The improved BoxWave Stylus head material is clearly superior to the old rubbery one. It glides smoothly and accurately. I only wish they would make one with a finer tip - they already have produced a smaller head rubber stylus and I can only believe the next model is in the works. I look forward to that improvement.
2,Durability is the main issue here,"As other customers have said, this pen doesn't last long, this is the third week I own it, and I'm about to ask for a replacement hoping the next one will last longer. the plastic cover on the bottom fell off and that is the main reason for this product to fail, Other than that this a great and very useful product..."
3,Not Worth The Money,I bought this stylus 2 weeks ago and the tip on it is starting to break. I have been using this stylus normaly not pressing the screen hard and the top is coming undone. Best stylus I have ever bought but will be sending it back.
4,good item,i bought this item a while ago and it wasn't the (newest Technology) but it was still a great product and it was a quality product
5,Great for iPad sketching!,"When I purchased my iPad 2, I picked up a pogo stylus with it. I was hoping to use the iPad as a digital sketchbook, but it was way too soft and spongy. The pogo was horrible to sketch with. The only way you could make a mark with it was by applying a ton of pressure on the screen, which is something I was not comfortable with. I searched for alternatives and came across the BoxWave Stylus. I'm very happy with this purchase. The tip is made of soft rubber and provides enough pressure to be able to draw on the iPad's screen. Its easy to draw with, you won't be forced to stab your ipad to make a line stroke on the screen. It's very responsive and feels great in my hand. I'd recommend it to anyone that is considering getting a stylus for ipad sketching."
5,Perfect for the Nook Color,This stylus is perfect for the nook. Especially if you have a cover that snaps. It plugs into the headphone jack at the top of your nook and tucks neatly next to it when you close your cover. It works great on the nook itself. no problems. I do think its a bit overpriced but there is no other real choice.
3,Decent but not much better than a finger,"This stylus is decent, but the tip is too soft and hollow. Subsequently when you push down to write, the entire tip collapses, making it difficult to be accurate. This pen would be much better if the tip was sharper and a touch harder. Using this pen in apps like PenUltimate or Notes PLus does not really register better results as opposed to a finger. It's decent when you're using it with painting apps though, hence the 3 stars."
4,Excellent,They say you don't need a stylus with an iPad but I am glad I have it! The package arrive right away and in perfect shape. You will be pleased with your purchase.
3,Meh.,"I've had this stylus for a week and I use it quite often. The pen itself works great - especially for the game DrawSomething. The only issue I have with it is the little black plastic thing that is supposed to go into the headphone jack broke in less than a week. Now it won't stay in there at all. Also, the silver matalic around the base of the pen, were the black rubber tip is, is wearing off already as well and I'm not exactly sure why that is becuase I don't know what it's rubbing against. Either way the pen works well, just seems very cheaply made. I'm going to see if I can get a refund possibly."
2,Not very satisfied,I was expecting the pen to write like a normal pen on my Ipad. It did not. I thought I need to practice a little more to get used to the pen and writing on Ipad and 15 days later its still bad. The tip of the pen is too broad to write.
2,Didn't last but a few weeks,"The tip is still ok, but the plastic headphone-jack-Lanier broke off in the jack, and I wasn't being rough with it. It just isn't made worth beans. The shiny metal collar you see in the photo around the base of the tip fell off and is now lost. The tip stylus stays on, but I didn't expect this product to spontaneously deconstruct. And in so short a time.I was expecting better workmanship, frankly, from reading the other reviews.Disappointed."
1,don't waste your money,"This sylus fell apart about ten minutes after my son used it. I purchased two of these, needless to say they are both going back..={"
2,Doesn't hold up,"I have ordered 2 of these, the first one had the soft rubber tip come out and there's no way to replace it and now the 2nd one is tearing. I use my iPad/stylus daily but I would think the stylus would last longer than a couple of months.Finally, it's not the most responsive pen I've ever used but it does ok."
3,Good and Bad Features,"I purchased theBoxWave Capacitive iPad Stylus (Crimson Red)and theTen One Design Pogo Sketch stylus for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch (Cactus Green).The BoxWave stylus was great for the headphone jack clip that always kept it nearby, but the spongy tip I found difficult to use and didn't provide the consistent flow I was looking for.The Pogo with its rubberized tip gave more consistency while writing, but its thin size is very easy to misplace or fall out your bag. The ""clip"" is useless unless you are clipping to a shirt pocket or pen pocket in a bag. I have 4 different cases and it doesn't work on any of them.[...] Thanks!"
2,Not great,"I was excited to try this stylus as the reviews were positive. I purchased this for writing on a note taking application. The tip is thick and bulky, handwriting appears as a grade schooler. After two weeks of using, the tip managed to rip right where the rubber meets the metal. I do like the fact the iPad is sensitive and not much pressure needed. ALSO, other stylus require the pen to be held perpendicular , this one does not."
2,iPad sometimes doesn't respond to pen,"If you are in a hurry writing down notes on your iPad, this pen could be a disaster. It frequently does not register the touch in applications like SoundPaper, PenUltimate, and others. It feels good in the hand and on the screen, but it just isn't reliably functional. I am disappointed in this $25 purchase."
1,Very poor product!,"I purchased this product after having read many reviews. Within 2 months the tip of my stylus fell off, after purchasing another Boxwave and having its tip fall off I contacted the Boxwave customer service people via email, basically I was told that there was nothing they could do. It was quite disappointing to be passed off to the retailer so quickly, I was shocked by the lack of concern for their product quality. I will not be purchasing another Boxwave."
4,Good stylus but not quite a pen,"This is a good stylus, but it's end is rounded, not pointed like a pen. Makes taking notes a little clumsy."
5,Love it,I purchased this stylus for cell phone use. I was tired of sending messages with crazy misspelled words either because I was hitting the wrong key or my nails were getting in the way - no longer the case with this stylus.
2,Great...while it lasted,"I bought this stylus back in April. It worked great until it died just today. Even worse, its death left black smears over my Ipad screen that I had to clean. For the price, I expect a stylus to last more than a few months, so I will be trying a different stylus this time."
1,hep,"don't waste your money on this thing. just stick a piece of sponge in a piece of aluminum tubing about the size of a pencil,and you have the same thing but it works better. shipping was almost as much as the pen. i bought this item based on the reviews. man did i get ripped off. save your money don't be a sucker like i was."
2,Cheap plastic,"The pen has a plastic holder attached to the clip. It plugs in to the headset port and holds the pen to the iPad when not in use. It is made of cheap plastic and the plug part breaks easily even when used carefully. The stylus itself is a nice product. Sadly, one small part makes the stylus not perform as advertised."
2,Not that great: Too Short. Too Skinny. Clinks.,"I was excited to get a stylus for my iPad but this one may not be right for me.To start the stylus is really small. I couldn't tell by the pictures but its about 3/4 the size of a regular pen. Not sure why they decided to make it shorter but if were just normal pen sized it would be small enough.Not only is it smaller, but it feels much thinner than a normal pen, or at least a comfortable pen with a grip. It's the diameter of school pencils, and while it may be ok for some, I have big hands and it feels like it will give me a cramp after a while.Finally, the leash that comes with it is annoying. The ring is metal and the hook is metal so when you're writing the ring CLINKS with the hook and makes a constant clinking sound. I had to remove it from the end because it was driving me nuts. Otherwise it works as designed.Tips for improvement: Larger diameter, maybe use rubber or plastic leash that doesn't clink in use. Perhaps a longer length."
3,Could be longer...,"Yes, it writes well, but it is too short--just 4 inches--and the tip could be better designed. The tip is so blunt and un-pen-like that it kept distracting me by calling attent to itself. So I am self-conscious each time I pick it up to write. Why can't the tip be near as narrow as that of a regular pen? After all, I remember the age of the HP ipaq days with the pen-like styli, though those were short too--but that's presumably because they were designed to fit into the holder."
4,"I'm not a graphic designer, so I probably didn't need this...","this product is well-worth the value, but after getting it, I find that I rarely use it.to be fair, I'm not a graphic designer...but I still give it a high rating.(to give you an idea- I used this for 3 days, then put it in my computer bag and forgot about it for a month)if I used it more, I would have given it 5 stars. It's durable, precise, easy to use and well-designed."
1,Short-term high,"The Boxwave stylus is great when you first use it. It will write nicely, it's easy to hold, and has a convenient attachment. However, much like many other customers have noted, the quality soon deteriorates. It is not durable at all. After two months of typical, daily usage, the paint has stripped off and more importantly, the rubber nib has lost all its functionality. Even if it hasn't fallen off, which seems to be a common scenario, the surface of the nib loses the frictionless quality it started out with and makes it nearly impossible to write anything meaningful.Avoid this product at all costs!!!"
5,Stop looking for something pointy and just buy this.,"Okay, so here's the deal. iOS technology is based on capacitive touch screens, which require a larger area of contact before the system registers input. That being said, you won't find a narrow tip!For 10 bucks, this is a great deal. I use this with Penultimate every day...keeping meeting notes for work, writing storyboards for films, even random drawings and stuff. I like how it feels in my hand, and I like that I can plug the top into the headphone port so I don't lose it when I walk.You have to get used to working with a pen like this, but after a couple days it gets easy. It's sometimes a pain to draw/write because the surface is so big, but that's a limitation of the devices, not this product.I highly recommend this for anybody who wants to take notes/draw/or just point at things on their capacitive devices."
4,An Amazing Stylus For The iPad,"This is a great stylus for the iPad.It's very light and even feels like a pen.I'll be honest, writing on the iPad isn't the best thing to do because your wrist touches the iPad far too often. Holding your wrist above the iPad is a bit awkward too.However, for taking down quick notes or even just for navigating, this is the best way to do it.The tip is rubberized and poofs down like a balloon, so you can actually apply pressure which feels very natural.One qualm I have: the clip doesn't really do much. If I want to clip it to my shirt or my binder (which I've done a few times), there's an uncomfortable amount of flex that makes me feel like it's about to break.However, if you don't plan on clipping it on anything (which most of us don't) go for it! For 15 bucks, no stylus can beat this."
3,Stylus,"I purchased two, in case I lose one. I have done some practice with both. They work fairly well. Both of them seem to skip some. I have to rotate the stylus in my fingers to get it going again. It certainly will be used to take notes in a presentation."
3,Stylus for iPad and iPhone,"No quarrel with the merchant. Fast and painless delivery, as advertised. And the price was better than ANYWHERE else I looked. But after a lot of usage, the top (not the part that makes ocntact with the screen) became unattached. I bought multiple units and happened on most. I attribute this to sloppy assembly by the manufacturer and in truth, nothing a little crazy-glue can't correct. Unfortuantely, no longer offered at the price I paid and I don't think I'll pay the going rate asked on several sites. I can live without this product at the current price point."
3,It feels too light.,"I ordered this because some of the reviews said it is IDENTICAL to Targas stylus. Well, it is not identical. It has identical LOOK except the string, but the weight is much lighter and feels like the body weight is not equally distributed. It did the writing OK, but Targas one feels more similar to the actual pen's weight- fit well in my finger."
5,My First Capacitive Stylus,This was my first Capacitive Stylus and I got it for my iPad. It was a great choice. It's very easy to use and feels almost like a real pen. Would definitely recommend to others.
3,Overpriced,"This is just a piece of plastic with a small rubber tip on the end. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I suppose that something more substantial would've been appreciated. The small metal ring that connects the stylus to the cord tends to rattle - annoying."
3,Great to use but falls apart,"I absolutely loved this pen. Then after about a month of use, the tip got a little hole in it. It still works but I am waiting for it to fall off. I would love to try it again...at their cost."
4,Good product,"I purchased both this and the pogo stylus. Subjectively, this was a better product. The stylus handle is thicker than the pogo stick, which makes it easier to handle for me. The tip registers better on the iPad screen than the pogo stick. In part, it may be because it more closely resembles a surface of a fingertip."
2,Tip drags on surface...,"Tried this in lieu of the Pogo, which seemed to get pretty middling reviews. The Boxwave is poor. It has a tougher, more rubberized tip, which in the abstract sounds like a good thing, but in reality makes it very hard to write with. The tip drags across the screen. Tried a friend's Pogo, and it's much better, smoother, more natural. I'll be getting one of those and hoping that iPad styli continue to improve and eventually get a true fine tip."
3,I loved it for a week...,"Then the fiber tip started wearing out, and now every time I use it I have little fibers on my screen. Disappointed, thinking of removing the fiber, because its just a rubber stylus beneath it."
2,The Tip Broke off in 3 months with moderate use.,"I love this stylus - it's fantastic - however, the tip broke off after 3 months of moderate use - I don't see any way to fix it and amazon says to contact boxwave - boxwave says to contact amazon - I contacted both - and still can't figure out how to re-attach the tip."
4,Boxwave- Excellent Stylus,"I was very pleased when I received this stylus in the mail. It is responsive and works well with the iPad and with several of the programs that involve actual handwriting on the tablet. Probably the only thing I was not crazy about was the thickness of the actual instrument and the thickness of the line it produces, due to the thickness of the rubber tip.I bought two of these and gave one to my son. He loves it and uses it on his Macbook Pro for graphics.Knowing then what I know now, I would purchase this again."
4,"Works well, but not child-proof","I have had this stylus for several weeks now and I love it. You can use it to draw, point and play fast games (like Bees vs Ants).One thing surprised me - when my 1-year-old got hold of the stylus and bit the tip - it popped! The tip is actually a thin rubber ball filled with air. So when it came in contact with sharp little teeth, it popped like a balloon with a loud pop!The stylus is still usable, but now I have to be really careful not to scratch the screen with the metal piece that is now sticking out from the inside of the stylus.Another durability failure is the metal that the pocket clip is made of - it bends very easy - after one time of attaching the stylus to the iPad case that I have, the clip bent and now does not hold the stylus any more.I am thinking of buying this same stylus again to replace the one that I have now. I will be very careful not to give the new stylus to the kids though."
5,Very good Stylus,"I use this stylus mainly for drawing on the iPad using the application Sketchbook Pro. It took a few tries to get used to it, but now I can't stop using it. I have been using this box wave stylus for about two and a half month and I most say it is awesome. Buy it."
5,Handy for iPad,"I am happy with this stylus. Although, I can't make a comparison because this is my first stylus. I use it for internet browsing and for writing notes in Penultimate. It does make selecting small links easier without having to enlarge the screen image. My only suggestion would be a finer tip, if possible. Otherwise, it's a handy tool to accompany an iPad. One last note. . . The little thing that supposedly works as an insert into the headphone jack doesn't seem to fit. I don't want to force it in and potentially break my headphone jack. So I don't use it."
3,Teensy-weensy little thing,"Hmmm. Well I can see why they kept the size specifications out of the product description. The barrel is only 4 inches long, and the diameter is similarly meek. I guess I was expecting something closer to pen size. Its hollow and almost too light; it would also be nice if it had some kind of grip or contour to it to make it easier to hold. For me, I found the shortness, thinness, and lack of grip/contours to be less than comfortable. The sensitivity is not nearly as good as your finger; meaning there are a lot of miscues. I'm also concerned about its durability based on reviewers experience after a month of use, which would not be surprising based on how cheaply it is made. $15.00 isn't a lot of dough, but $10 would be more appropriate. I wonder if one could find out where to buy just the high density capacitive foam piece, and then glue it on the end of an unsharpened pencil, or some other suitable writing tool? Well, maybe my expectations were too high."
3,Not so durable,Upon initial use I really liked the stylus. But within an hour of use the tip fell off and continues to fall off. Very disappointed in the quality. If I can find a way to keep the tip on I think I will like it.
4,So far so good,"I bought this for my teenaged daughter to use with a drawing application on my iPad. In researching the various options, it seems the cheaper ones have a point that can wear out quickly. So, I decided to pay the extra money for this stylus. It seems to be well constructed and my daughter is happy with both the comfort and the precision of the stylus."
4,Stylus for Brushes and SketchBook Pro,"The stylus is better than my finger for many uses, as it is smaller, and I can therefore aim it more carefully. I lose it a lot and it has a string coming from it with a small plastic thingy on the end that I have no idea what to do with. The rubber tip seems to be hollow, and i'm not sure if it will withstand the test of time. I don't think there are any moving parts or batteries, but the sheet that came with it is not of much use. I'm wondering why it isn't smaller in diameter to give even more precision?Otherwise, it does its job and I use it when working in the apps, Brushes and Sketchbook Pro, where it seems to do a fine job."
4,iPad Stylus,"I'm not really sure why I bought this other than it looks cool and matches my case. Other than that, I haven't found much use for it."
2,Very disappointing,"I purchased this to take notes but it is so inaccurate, it is impossible to write/draw anything with this stylus."
4,Best stylus i have used so far,The mesh tip blows away using a rubber tip on an ipad. Can't beat the price either. I plan on ordering a few more
5,Great buy - great product,"Surprised at how much I'm using the stylus. So much easier than my finger. Even though the ""point"" is rounded - it's more accurate than using a finger. Like this tool."
5,Love this Stylus!,This is a great stylus. The Mesh tips is so much better for handwriting on the iPad screen. The bungee cord is long enough to use the stylus while still attached to the iPad. I still have this stylus!
5,Works great!,"I like this stylus so much better than the rubber-tipped kind that we use at school. With this stylus, there's never a danger of scratching the screen. The cord to attach to the iPad is very handy. Definitely worth the slightly higher price."
3,Eh..,"It worked ok for a bit, but wasn't worth ordering and waiting for it to arrive. After about 2 months the nib was already tearing and felt like taking a damp sponge to your iPad screen. I reccomend saving up for a bamboo stylus."
4,"Didn't think I needed a stylus, but glad I got this one.","I got great service from this 3rd party merchant; item arrived on time, packaged well and item was in good condition. I am really glad I got the stylus, since my fingers were ""mucking"" up my screen every time I used my iPad. Really cool that it latches into the iPad or I would have lost it the first day. Pretty cool item, does what I thought it would do."
5,This is a very worthwhile investment,This stylus emulates the density of your finger and makes foe a very easy to use and accurate tool. It is good for quick notes with a hand writing app and works as a sketch tool. I did some research and this product was highly rated and I am very happy with mine.
3,"A decent stylus, poorly placed pocket holder","The Boxwave stylus works as advertised on the iPad and iPhone, but has a poorly placed pocket clip which makes it uncomfortable to hold given its diminutive size."
5,Great Stylus,"After searching around for a stylus to get, I settled on the BoxWave. Solid construction, light, feels good and easy to use. Even has a cool little tether that you can plug into your iPhone or iPad's headphone input for travel. Originally got it to use with Penultimate (which it works great with), but I find myself reaching for it whenever I fire up the phone or pad. Great for games and general use, keeps the screen smudge free and just all-around nice to use. Highly recommend."
3,iPad stylet,"Umm.....nice, but overpriced. Target, etc., are couple $$ cheaper despite tax. Also, the entire idea of a iPad stylet is great (with the rubber tip) but wish it were longer. The clip keeps jabbing my hand and I need to hold it a certain, rather uncomforable way in order for it not to jab. It's okay, I guess. I may hard tape the clip down with padding of some sort."
4,Almost always works,"I like it a lot. But it doesn't always pick up my writing. I write in iOS apps and sometimes it doesn't pick up the writing. I write pretty fast, though, and it just misses a mark here and there."
1,Received wrong item,The item described and pictured is the Evertouch capacitative stylus by Boxwave.. The item I received and most people seem to be reviewing is the original Boxwave stylus with rubber tip. Has anyone actually received the Evertouch stylus with the fiber mesh tip???
3,"Excellent product, with no durability","If you feel that spending this amount, for a product excellent in its function, but can only be used for a couple of days is justified, then this is the product to buy. I have used this for about 10 days, and every day of using it was a bliss. It functioned exactly the way I would want any stylus to work....smooth, balanced and easy to draw curves. But unfortunately, this did not work more than 10 days for me. The tip just tore off, and I wasn't even able to replace it. I found fibermesh stylus from the same company and I am yet to try it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QYD5NO/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00"
3,"Like the tether, didn't last","I might be hard on styli, but this particular stylus didn't last. First, the rubber tip started catching on the iPad screen as I took notes. Then, the rubber popped right off and wouldn't re-attach. The tether to plug into the earphone jack was a great touch, but not worth it when the piece doesn't last."
1,Good idea. Defective. Poor customer service.,"We bought this and generally liked how it worked with the iPad. Although not ultra-precise, it allowed for easier writing and for my daughter to practice her letters. Cool feel and weight. It was only used with our iPad in the manner suggested and the tip came off within 35 days of purchase. There is no way to re-assemble and this is clearly a defective one. A few days later I sent an email to Boxwave and they responded a week later telling me that this was my problem (they don't service any item sold by Amazon and Amazon doesn't allow for returns outside the 30 day window). They offered a 15% discount on future purchases. Yours will likely break and they will not stand behind it. Find another product from another company."
5,Simple and as effective as it can be.,"After using one of these for the first time, I get the idea that ""capacitive"" in this sense is the ""give"" that the tip of the stylus has, smushing almost like a soft finger tip. This is what touch screens recoginze, to cut down on false positives.I think it has just a little bit larger of a surface area touching the screen at once than if I'm being very careful with my fingers (I have large hands, with fairly thin fingers). It also has the disadvantage of not being able to pinch-to-zoom, making getting at those very small links even more difficult.It's great for not getting oils all over the screen or using while wearing gloves. The big disadvantage is having it available when you need it.To be clear, I give the whole idea of a stylus in everyday situations 2 or 3 stars. If you want one for whatever the situation, I believe this device deserves 5 stars, as it is of good quality, does what it is meant to do, and is not in need of any obvious improvements."
5,No more lost stylus!,The stylus itself is fine. It's the little cord on it that plugs into your earphone jack that's so great. I keep losing stylus and now don't have to worry about it.
3,Spendy Stylus,Works ok with my i Pad. Works better than a rubber tipped stylus. It's ok. Not as great as I had expectations about.
2,Feels like a cheap toy,Pros:I can't think of any. For $7 it isn't even the cheapest.Cons:It is a hollow aluminum tube. This gives it a cheap feeling and a poor weight distribution.The tip is just a hollow ball of thin rubber. It looks like a pencil eraser it easily collapsed when you push it against this screen. This means that it is hard to control the stylus pressure and it makes writing feel unnatural.
2,The Stylus is Too Short for My Use,"I returned the sylus because I found the length to be too short. I know some folks like the shorter ones, but I do not. I opted for the Boxline Skinny Capacitive Stylus instead which is the longest one they make apparently. It feels more like a standard pen in my hand."
1,Not impressed,"Didn't work well with my iPod or iPad's 1 and 3. Works ok, but you can buy better from Amazon or Ebay when you buy the 8 pack which kills this product.I bought the (8) Capacitive Stylus Pen for Samsung Exhibit II 4G Ominia W Stratosphere which is a far superior product.Not sensitive enough to respond, tip is hard and unresponsive.I sent them back."
4,OK but too expensive,"I bought this pen because it had a number of favorable reviews on Amazon. It's fine. It does what it's supposed to and is better than trying to use your finger to draw or write on the iPad. I paid around $17 which is way too much for a hollow aluminum cylinder with a bit of rubber on the end. It should be closer to $5. I would like it if it had more weight to it and was longer. It's quite tiny. The small plastic clip which is made to go into the iPad's headphone jack, is not to be trusted. The pen falls out easily. Better to use the clip to clip it to your iPad's case."
4,Love this pen,"I love this pen, its great to use for the ipad. My only issue is that this pen requires a little more pressure when writing then I am use to but I am a light writer. I use this with the ipad penultimate software and it really works well."
4,BoxWave improves handwritten notes on the iPad,"I ordered this to annotate pdf documents, draw and take notes using the Penultimate app on my iPad. It works beautifully and is a dream to write with. If I have any complaints, it's the precision of the tip, which is about the size of my finger. I wonder if it's possible to make the tip more like a pen or pencil for a finer line. That being said, I still found this product to be more durable than another brand's ""foam tipped"" stylus that I purchased, and much better than using my finger to write. :) It also clips nicely to my iPad cover so it's with me all the time. The BoxWave stylus and my iPad have virtually eliminated the need for paper in my daily life."
1,Horrible!,I have bought two of these now and BOTH broke within a very short time frame. The first one the soft part on the end you use to touch the screen with just came off one day. I thought it was just a bad one so I got a new one and now the end that goes into the headphone jack broke and won't stay in anymore!
2,not a high quality product,"It works great when I first got it. Four days into using it, the rubber tip fell off. You can put it back on, but if you press down hard on the tip, it would falls off again."
1,Defective--Tip fell off within 2 days of use,I purchased this because of the color. I find it very difficult to use since the screen doesn't always sense the tip. Then the tip came unattached and I am not sure how well glue will hold the thing.
5,Impressive!,"I was skeptical, but this stylus is actually pretty impressive! It is comfortable and easy to use, glides smoothly across the iPad screen's surface, and it's very responsive and accurate. Highly recommended!"
1,Struggling stylus,"Ever since I pulled this out of the package the little rubber tip kept falling off . There is no way this piece will stay on because there is very little for it to grip to. Poorly manufactured! I dread the idea of sending it back for a replacement or refund, just save us all and remove it from the market until a more stable model is designed"
2,Box wave capacity iPad stylus,"Not sure if I am being fair to the pen but I was expecting to be able to 'free write' like on a piece of paper or a palm pilot and it sure is nothing like this.The pen is nice enough and works but the precision and size of the end of the stylus is not suitable for free writing. Works well as a point and click device and if that's what you're buying it for, you will be pleased. Otherwise it's a waste of money.May be the iPad screen is not 'sensitive' enough for this type of use in the first place?"
2,Not For Me,"I have owned this item for about 30 minutes. In another 30 minutes it will be returned for a refund. Maybe it's me or maybe it's that I have a screen protector but this just isn't for me. In using Note Taker the pen only worked part of the time, often omitting complete letters. And, again maybe this is due to my screen protector, it squeaked the entire time I tried to use it. Perhaps it is better than ""Pogo"" but I have not used one to make a comparison. I think for me I am going to scrap the whole idea and buy a blue-tooth keyboard."
1,Poor quality!,"This product is frustratingly disappointing. While it does perform as it should, it is poorly made though it looks fine. The soft spongy tip at the end is already falling off and I have only used this for 3 days, and intermittently at that. Plus, when one attempts to write with it on ""Noterize,"" it has one ""setting"" - thick as if it is a three year old writing with a large pencil or very thick crayon. How is this supposed to allow one to use the iPad as a true note taking device? I dont' mind that it is shorter than an average pen, I can live with that. But the poor quality is most annoying. I would return this lousy item but the return shipping is likely to be half the cost of this stylus and thus another waste of my money."
1,Poorly made,"Within Few days of use, the rubber tip came off and now does not stay on at all. Very disappointed in the weak manufacturing of the device."
2,Works but better alternatives,It works but no better than than those that come in a package of three that sell for about the same price. I found the attachment distracting and removed it. I like the Kensington that has a ball point pen . It is much longer and easier to write with.
3,hello,If you could make the tip smaller and harder like a pen roller ball that would be great. The ends wear out and tear to quickly? Why can't this be resolved.
5,So far so great!,This is my third different style of stylus. It is my first fiber mesh. I really like it so far. It seems really durable. Let's hope it lasts longer than my first two!
2,Buyer Beware!,I was sent a stylus with old technology and in the box it did not come with all three of the extra items pictured so I will be sending back.
5,Great price stylus --,"This little thing is great for keeping fingerprints off the screen of my Zune HD - kind of a pet peeve of mine. You have to push on it a little harder than I'd like but it's a lot easier to use than fingers for text input. Overall, it's a great little tool for the price!"
3,So So,"I expect better. I still need to slow.. down to see what I write. Lots of time, it is not as sensitive, not picking up what I write. Still better than using my finger."
3,It works,I find I don't use this as much as I thought I would. I ordered it when I got my new phone & iPad. It feels rather spongy to me when I use it and despite it connecting very nicely to the headphone port I tend to forget it is in the case because I seldom remember to reconnect it to the headphone port. I don't know how it could be improved. It does work. It doesn't scratch the screen. It's not bad it's just... not great I suppose.
3,Its Okay,"I liked the Ever Touch Capacitive Stylus, however the little rope like thing that hangs off the top of the stylus didn't last for very long."
3,Okay stylus,I bought this while looking for a longer stylus than the one I had. The length and thickness are average but the BoxWave tip does not glide across my Tablet screen as easily as my rubber tipped stylus.
3,Too slick to grip,"This stylus is very attractive & works very well. It is VERY sensitive, sometimes too much so. It glides delicately over the screen on my Nexus 7. Unfortunately, I have 2 major problems with it. First, the barrel is so smooth & slick, it is difficult to grip and second, the clip on the barrel is so tight, I can't clip it on anything when it is not in use. It will do for now, but I plan to order the Amazon Executive stylus when it is available, to replace this one."
2,Not Durable as Advertised,"I bought one of these from Amazon as a Christmas gift It was listed as ""newest technology"" and they hyped the ""Durable FiberMesh Tip"" for iPad-3. The one I bought has only been used since Dec.25th (20 days) and already it has a hold worn through the ""DURABLE"" fiber mesh. This is obviously unacceptable. The stylus still works on the iPad but this isn't what we expected. Also we noticed that the stylus was supposed to include THREE types of lanyards - ours only had one included. The quality of the fiber mesh is not ""durable"" as advertised."
2,"Could be better,but OK","What I like...the attached storage cord that fits in the phone jackWhat I do not care for...for my hand, I wish the stylus was longer. Also, the tip of the stylus sometimes does not work well and you have to press extra hard on the screen or repeated times.For the cost, not a bad deal. If you want a premium stylus be prepared to invest more than a couple of dollars."
1,not durable,Stylus tip robbed off after a couple of weeks of medium use now it wont slide on my ipad anymore. Waste of money.
4,Works well but attachment is fragile,"I ordered this for my niece to accompany a new iPad2. It works well, has a nice feel but the attachments (the ear phone socket connector and the pen clip) both are quite fragile. The ear phone attachment broke after a couple weeks of use and the pen clip started coming loose from the body."
3,"As described, but why so expensive?","This is a perfect stylus for hand writing notes/drawing/math classes. However after I bought this one, my girlfriend bought a pack of 3 that cost her $4 of a different type of stylus (don't know what) and they were almost exactly the same. They didn't slide perfectly the same as this one, but there was less resistance than a normal pencil on paper so it's not a difference that would affect you. Besides the price, this is a great product."
5,Very Nice for the IPad,I really like this pen for my iPad. My only complaint is i wish it were about an inch longer.
5,Works great,"After four weeks of use, it still works great. No complaints. I use it for taking notes on my Notes Plus app on the iPad."
3,Fair,My first stylus purchase. I think it is just fair and a little too soft on the tip. I bought one at TJ Maxx last week for $5 and it works much better. I gave this one to my neice.
3,Hardy Stylus,"I bought this stylus to use for writing notes and drawing on my new retina iPad. The tip is a squishy rubbery ball and not that firm, so it's a little unusual to use at first. It may squeak if used with a device that has a screen protector installed. This was a little irritating when I was in a business meeting. Other than that, it has held up very well. I have not experienced it breaking like some other people have said in their reviews. It is very light to hold.My only disappointment is that it cannot make precise strokes. There are sometimes workarounds to this if the note/drawing app you are using has a zoom feature, but the stylus is not as precise as a regular pen or a stylus from a palm pilot, for example."
4,Boxwave stylus pretty good,"I purchased an iPad for the express purpose of replacing paper in my life. I needed a stylus that would be easy to hold and simulate a ""pen"" writing experience. This stylus is easy to hold but, while using it on the writing recognition application, it ""skipped"" more often than the other stylus I purchased (bought two to test and choose). For gaming, surfing and other apps where you simply ""poke"" a button or link, this stylus performed very well and my wife loves it (gave it to her since she isn't using it for writing like I intend).I like the feel of the tip on the surface of the iPad and it gives a positive feedback feeling. The unit has a thickness that simulates a pen feel better than the other stylus I purchased (Pogo), too, but overall I have to rate this one 4 stars for my use."
2,Not worth it,"It sounds like a winner with the mesh tip, but you have to press much harder than you should for the iPad to sense it. It takes me longer to write using it than with my fingers."
4,You can't ask for much more,"This a really nice looking functional item. I use it with my iPhone 4 and it works just as good as your hand, unless you want to use multi touch, then... Anyway the biggest annoyance with this stylus is also a very nice feature, the string. You probably read that it is used to hook into the 3.5 jack on the iDevice, which is a nice idea. The problem is that the string slides all over and gets in the way of your hand, but that is not really a big deal. The stylus is smaller than I thought it would be, but that's actually a good thing. It's only about as tall as an iPhone or iTouch, so it is convenient to carry around. Overall I would recommend this product if your looking for a good iDevice stylus."
4,Nice capacitive stylus. Works great with my Kindle Fire HD,"Save yourself some finger smudges and get one of these. Love the colors.Smooth and fast for zipping through your app's and typing onscreen.The clips could be redesigned to hook to something besides the sound plug,"
5,Works Well With iPad,I have been using this with my iPad for a few months and it works very well. My only criticism would be that I wish there was a way to completely detach all the lanyard devices from the stylus when they are not used.
4,Much better than the foam-tipped styluses,I used to have a foam-tipped stylus and it hurt my hand to write with it. This is much more precise with less pressure.
3,Effective and not expensive.,"I now have four. I recommend a color array. It does better than fat fingers working a touch screen. Keep one in the iPAD bag. The little accessory lanyards are of no great value, nor do I choose to hang it from the audio port. I buy enough so if I mislay it, c'est la vie....good item. I like it."
2,Very disappointed with how long it lasted!,"When i first got this, it was THE BEST STYLUS I have ever had! It was way better than any rubber tip stylus that I have ever tried. However, it lasted only a month before a hole started to appear in the fabric and after having it for almost 3 months it is worse than having to use a rubber tip stylus. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it was amazing when I first bought it."
3,Pricey but useful,The price is a little compared to others but it is useful. I do like the part where you can plug it into the headphone port so you always have it with you.
5,Better than fingers on the screen,"I got my new iPad because I wanted to draw on the screen. I needed more control than my fat finger, so I ordered this stylus from BoxWave. It's great, works just as I hoped. The tip is a rubber dome about the size of my little finger. It's not sponge, like some others, and its durable. I carry it around in my pocket, no problem. On the other end is a short string (about 1.5"") with a plastic plug on the end that fits into the earphones hole. This helps keep the stylus with the iPad when you're not using it. It also has a pocket clip on the side of the aluminum barrel.As a bonus, this keeps my screen smudge-free. No more finger prints building up on the shiny surface. And it works on my phone, too. All in all, a very useful accessory for mobile devices with touch screens."
5,A great accessory!,"I use my iPad for just about everything from note taking, sketching and playing games. I use the BoxWave for all of them and enjoy how responsive it is and that it doesn't leave smudges."
4,Very useful,Great app for writing notes on iPad. It works very well and parters perfectly with penultimate.My iPad has simply made me throw all my notebooks out to write down all my notes on my iPad.
5,"A little short, but it works great","I wasn't sure why I needed a stylus for my new IPad, but once I tried the Boxwave Capacitive stylus, I won't use my IPad without it. It is a little short for my hand, but I got use to it in minutes. I'm recommending this to all my friends'"
5,No more fingerprints!,This purchase was a great addition to my new iPad. It works just as good as your finger without leaving any fingerprints on your screen. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes keeping their iPad screen clean and fingerprint free!
3,Length of service a bit limited,"Use of this stylus was absolutely great. Great weight along with great usability. I have a serious complaint about longevity. I purchased 1 and used it for a couple of months then bought 2 more (this was one of the second group) At this writing, this is the only one left that is moderately usable (if I can push about a quarter of the tip back into its slot.I like the product, but I feel like I should get at least 12 months of use at a reasonable level (not for work). None of the Box Wave products came close. If you don't mind getting a new one every three months, then you'll like these."
1,Not happy!,"Not happy! - only use 2 months and the tip has spit, cant use now.BoxWave Capacitive iPad Stylus (Jet Black)"
1,Does not work well with HP touchsmart computer,"My HP touchsmart computer (which has a capacitive touch screen) came with its own stylus which works fine. I also bought this one as a backup. But the computer does not recognize it. You have to press really hard and it is frustrating trying to use it. Perhaps the problem is with the HP, but this product did advertize that it can work with ANY capacitive touch screen. That is not accurate."
5,Nice and Light,"The Boxwave Evertouch is an amazing stylus. It flows smoothly on my ipad 2 screen. It's light weight meaning I can control it without stressing my hands, especially when drawing with precision. Compared to other brand styli, the Evertouch's fibermesh fabric tip is sturdy and works great without using a lot of pressure. You don't have to worry about it ripping/bending like those styli that have rubberized/cotton tips. I for one am very satisfied with the results and I would definitely suggest this to others."
1,Product fell apart on first use,Don't waste your money on this product it fell apart on first use !!!Total failure and not worth the money!!!!!
3,boxwaave evertouch captive stylus,"i ordered this because i wanted to try the mesh tip and the tether. i'm not dissatisfied, but i'm not 100% either. i would not order this again. i'm hoping the tip will not eventually damage the screen surface. this stylus is not as responsive as the human fingertip."
1,Disappointed.,"The reviews I read were mostly positive for this pen, but it did not impress me.When using an iPad, you have to press a tad harder than I thought to get a response from the pen. Very annoying. Plus, the tip is super soft. When trying to use the pen on an angle, I feel you can scratch the iPad screen with the aluminum casing when pressing down on it too hard. I will be buying a proper stylus pen from Wacom."
5,Stylus Perfectus,This is an excellent product. I received my new iPad and was concerned about leaving smudge marks on the screen. I ordered the stylus and it works very well. No more smudge marks on the screen. I am a firm believer in Amazon products and this is just one example of good products found here.
1,"Definitely not ""durable construction""",Length:: 1:23 MinsI wasn't pleased with the quality of this item; my review demonstrates an issue others have noticed wherein the rubber tip comes loose from the stylus and is not replaceable.
1,Don't Buy,Within two months the rubber tip broke off. Contacted BoxWave and the told me to contact Amazon. Amazon tells me to contact the Amazon Marketplace seller (BoxWave). Catch 22. All I wanted was a new pen or replacement rubber tip but all I have is a useless expensive non workable pen.
1,Rubber tip came right off,"I bought this pen based on everyone's positive reviews. I was excited when I received it and was eager to try it out. After just a few minutes flipping pages of an ebook, the rubber tip came off. I was luck to have found it as it bounced. I don't know if this was defective or somehow I don't know how to use it (can't be that hard, right?) Anyway, I have not figured out how to securely put the rubber tip back. I will return this one and hope the next one is better glued on or something. I would hate to scratch up my ipad from the metal part of the pen."
3,Solid quality but unable to replace pen and paper,"The BoxWave stylus is solidly built and comfortable to use. It comes with a lanyard to attach the stylus to your iPad by sticking a plug into the headphone jack. The lanyard is short and must be unplugged from the iPad before using the stylus.I purchased this stylus hoping that I could take hand written notes on an iPad. On paper I have small, neat hand writing but with this round-tipped stylus I could do no better than big letters and non-detailed sketches. With this stylus you can write more quickly than with your finger, however the results are no more legible or accurate.Most users searching for a stylus in order to take notes and draw on their iPad will be dissatisfied with a round-tipped stylus such as this one."
3,Less precise than a pen,I had hopes that I could replace my routine scratch paper with an ipad and stylus. I find two major problems: The ipad screen is not big enough and the precision of the stylus that does not come to a fine-tip (and I can find none that do) is inadequate.
4,Fiber Mesh Tip works well!,"Fiber mesh tip works very well. I've had couple rubber tip styli and they all create too much drag on the iPad surface, and some require too much pressure to register response on the screen. This new BoxWave fiber mesh tip glides effortlessly across the screen and the tip is very responsive. No need to press down hard to get a response.The only reason I'm not giving it a 5-star is because the tip is a bit too thick for my taste. It's hard for me to be very precise with it. Also the barrel is a bit too light in my opinion. If BoxWave addresses these two issues, this is easily the best stylus out there period."
4,Meet the love children of Jerry Lee Lewis and Adolph Hitler!,Short and sweet ... you ain't heard nutin' 'til you've heard rockabilly from the Motherland! Tons of fun.
1,not happy with product,Very dissappointed in the quality. Had the water totter out at a lake 1 day and it ripped at the seam.
4,adult fun!,"We had too much fun on this toy! Both teens and adults enjoyed it. The downside is it is not very durable, we have gone through 4 and it gets expensive."
2,Sloppy and hastily done,"This book is an interesting attempt to do something worthwhile, but the writing is very poor and there are too many factual errors. For example, just about every Italian word or phrase used is misspelled or somehow botched. The ""ordering"" of the Italian greats doesn't work at all--he just puts all the scientists first, then moves into other areas. A straight chronological approach would have been better. There are some real howlers--as when a portrait of the 19th-century opera composer Vincenzo Bellini is used to illustrate an essay on the Bellini family of Renaissance painters. The inclusion of people like Madonna also doesn't add to this book's appeal."
3,No other choice,"The major drawback is that the drawings of the birds described in the book are poor so that it is often difficult to use them for identification. The text is fine. However, it is the only book available, so you have no choice."
3,Too bulky,"The book is fine in what it covers, but when I bought the book, I had the impression that it was a handy field guide. Its really quite bulky and heavy. Not easy to carry when you are travelling light and trying to avoid excess baggage fees!"
2,Birds of Panama needs an update,This guide lacks the things today's birders have come to expect from a good birding guide. There are no range maps. The color plates are awkward to use because they are not near the text that describes the birds. It has many other shortcomings that make it less than optimal. The government of Panama should commission a good bird book if they want to encourage birders to visit Panama.
2,A hefty reference work.,"Probably still an indispensable reference work for the country, with stacks of useful information and interesting species accounts. However it suffers from the typical drawbacks of latin american guidebooks of its era, namely no range maps; overcrowded plates; somewhat unatractive illustrations; plates in sections separate from the species accounts; thick and heavy to carry; not all species illustrated. Etcetera. Its weight alone is injurious to the flight baggage allowance."
3,"A gentle, fast-paced trip through B&D","A sexy walk down the road of B&D. No blood, gore, or agony; just good ol' lust. I wasn't thrilled with the amount of girl/girl sex(there's a lot of it), but the scenes with the Master are HOT. A good book to share with a lover."
5,Very stimulating,"The book that I purchased finally finished reading it. It took me only three days to finish this book. It was very explicit in detail and the imagery was even better. The plot was very interesting and the characters was very enthusiastic, zealous, and invigorating. Even though, the plot was very explicit the imagery was even better from the detailed words."
4,Really Good,This is more a like it. The plot kept getting interesting as I read. I recommend you pick this one up.
3,Esentially Just What It Says.,"This is basically just a list of ways to finance a film. Each method is listed with advantages and disadvantages, most of which you could easily discern for yourself. If you are looking for something that reveals some insider secret to financing your film, this is not it. Does give some informative terminology, but nothing you couldn't find in any number of other books. If you are new to the business, I recommend something a little more in depth, even producer production notes will be more helpful. If you're a pro, this will give you no new insight."
2,Way too expensive for a lot of outdated information,"The book does has some useful tidbits here and there, but all in all it's asking price (when I bought it for $35) was grossly excessive, particularly its legal section. If its not on discount (<$10) don't bother."
5,A Man For All Time,"John Goddard is a remarkable person. As a boy, he decided to make a list of all the things he wanted to accomplish in his lifetime, after listening to adults lamenting the things they wanted to do, but never did. This book describes the accomplishment of just one of over 100 goals he set in his youth. Reading the book puts you right in the middle of this adventure. You can feel the sweat, and the mosquitoes. You feel the fear during dangerous escapes from rhino. You feel the tiredness in your arms from paddling the kayak. You also feel the exhiliaration of traversing rapids, or a bath and clean clothes. You really get the feel of the many different peoples that Dr. Goddard meets along his journey, and you get to know his companions that accompanied him. What a vacarious adventure."
3,Does the job,This lock could use a longer throw rod for engaging with the garage door track. I wish it was 2 inches longer. Mine barely engages.
5,nothing but,"On my second pair. They are the best! I used to be a nothing but b_____k guy but since getting my Naot clogs ...well there's little,if any, comparison. I wear a shoe type Naot to work and then slip right into the Glacier. I spend most of the day standing and walking (third grade teacher) You won't be sorry!"
4,Nice mystery...a change of pace.,I have an '84 edition of this book as well as this one. It is well written and enjoyable and quite different from other books she has done even though it is in the same genre. I enjoyed it a lot. I think you will too.
3,Commercial binding?,"Beautiful work, beautifully presented. The binding, however, is hopeless. Particularly surprising coming from a publisher like Rizzoli. If you're looking for a loose portfolio of some of the best architectural design of today in a heavy cardboard box without dust jacket this is highly recommended. The work deserves better."
3,Arcadian Architecture: Bohlin Cywinski Jackson-12 Houses,"It is a very nice book and one that my son wants very much to add to his liabrary as he is studying architecture. The book seems to be coming apart, only strings are holding it togehter. It looks like the glue has pulled apart where we have started looking at the book."
1,Pseudo-science at its worst,"This book promises a unified theory of mind, language, and the fundamental laws of the universe. What it delivers, however, is a jumbled mish-mash of pseudo-science, curiosities, fallacious arguments and bad reasoning. The structure is unbearably random, wildly jumping from one subject to another, rarely clear on what is supposed to be proven or disproven by his listings of coincidences and weak strings of logic. In the parts where I have more than a layman's knowledge of the matter, I can easily spot numerous errors. This book could be used for only two things: Practicing your skills at detecting pseudo-science, and exercising your basic logic in refuting his bogus arguments. In no way is this book worth your money or your time."
2,Ultimately Pointless,"Okay, so the stories in Genesis can be interpreted an infinite number of ways. The only thing that really matters is what did the people who wrote these stories intend them to mean; a point that is totally overlooked in this series. Comments on the stories often have absolutely no basis in the text. The individual just WANTS to believe that's what the story means. A lot of talk with no foundation. A lot of opinions with no information. A major disappointment coming from Bill Moyers."
2,Not worth the price,"Very disappointed. Ordered this to treat myself. I expected luxury. This is a basic, light weight, waffle weave robe and it's not very roomy or soft. Way over-priced.The worst part was the size! I am 5'8"" and a size 4, but have long legs and arms. I ordered the UNISEX robe size MEDIUM, which is a size up for me. If the robe is to fit a medium size man, then they must make these for very tiny people.The sleeves run real short and so does the length. It is not pre-shrunk so expect it to get a full size smaller after washing. Sent it back for a full refund."
5,Un breve viaje al pasado,"En este libro loaeza nos muestra una resemblanza de lo que habitaba en el pensamiento de la ""gente Bien"" de los años 80's, desde su afinidad a hacer sus compras en el extranjero, los colegios de sus hijos, sus ""preocupaciones"" hasta la gran caida del poder adquisitivo a traves de las multiples devaluaciones del pais.Vale la pena el viaje al pasado, pero debemos de recordar a cada momento que esto es la vivencia de la ""gente bien"" o ""clueless"""
3,"Sex, Spirit, and You...","I read this book in an hour and an half. It was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a lot more about sex and spirituality.The book really din't touch to much on the topic of spirituality.It's an easy read, but not a lot of imformation. Save your money and your time."
4,Great source for BBQ recipies,"If you buy this book, you wont learn how to BBQ. It doesnt cover enough (or any) on selecting meat, selecting the BBQ smoker, proper cooking technique, etc. But what you do get, that makes this a worthwhile purchase, is a huge amount of great recipies. Where else can you be be looking for BBQ sidedishes like potato salad and coleslaw, and find multiple recipies of each?"
2,Total disappointment!,"For a barbecue book to be titled as this one is, I expected it to be a great book. I was sadly disappointed. A collection of very basic recipes that really left a lot to be desired. Don't let the name fool you. Kansas City is known for some great barbecue for sure. Unfortunately, it's now known for a not so great book. There are too many good books on barbecue to waste your money on this one."
1,Save Your money,"From the begining the author starts with a self love fest and doesnt even cover any integration details until at least 1/3 through the book. If you are a Windows Admin trying to convince yourself how tough Linux is this book is for you. The author is tied to some old ideas and still uses the LPR as the reason why printing is hard. The author claims to be a Linux guy but comes off sounding like he is in love with everything that MS does. (He takes a few jabs at MS expense, but they are terse at best) Better coverage is given to Windows and Linux integration in general Linux admin book. (the best two I have read in the last year Linux System Administration A Beginners Guide and Linux System Administration A Users Guide.-but either or find another book, but this one is best left in the bookstore)"
2,Sabian Cymbal Cleaner,Better off with the Blitz Cymbal cleaner for way less $$$. Works way better and easier than Sabian or Vater cymbal cleaner.
2,Disappointed,"First of all I LOVE Ashley & her character, Sharpay, but 3 questions:1. Where was Ryan????2 Why did it go to DVD BEFORE it aired on TV?3. Why was the TV version different then the DVD? Why did they cut the DVD short??? I would never have bought it had I known the tv version was longer!"
4,sharpsy's fabulous adventure,Great Dvd. Injoyed this Dvd. I like this kind of Dvd. And thank for coming on time. m gong to watch this Dvd alot.
4,totally cute..,I really liked this movie. it was very cute. It showed how a rich brat had to start from scratch and I am starting from scratch so there is hope.. haha my kids love dogs and I love pink so the whole family enjoyed this.
1,NOT fabulous,"This movie is a bad version of Legally Blonde 2 (blonde & pink girl + puppy = movie?), which says a lot since Legally Blonde 2 was terrible. Sharpay was never this sweet, I was hoping to see the bad girl win out for once. They basically made up a new character and used Ashley Tisdale (not her fault, terrible writing) and Sharpay's name. Ryan is absent which is a disappointment. This has practically nothing to do with High School Musical and I wish I never saw it."
1,Sharpay's Fabulous adventure,"As of today, I have been unable to get the movie to operate at all. I am going to try it again,but it may be coming back!!"
2,"Awesome Movie, but Case is awful and misleading.","Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure was really cute and the clutch is really sweet. The only thing I really don't like is that this was a misleading product. I knew the clutch came with it, but not holding the DVDs and it comes with a clear flimsy plastic case, which has a paper telling you about the movie. Also, I was going to give the clutch to my daughter, but not now because it's going to hold the DVDs. If I knew this I would of bought the regular version, of this DVD. The price for this item is horrible and way to much money. The GREAT thing is that this movie came with a pamphlet and it saying you can spend $6.00 for the clutch.. isn't that just awesome. I think that this product was not described enough and therefore is a misleading product."
4,Who Sharpay is,"I seen the movie, it's really good. Sharpay was the main antagonist of three high school musicals and the person people love to hate. No one ever believe they would make a spin off movie about main antagonist like Sharpay, but they did and the writers did an amazing job turning this character into main proganist. Ashley Tisdale made an extraordinary performance in this movie. I'm really proud of her turning Sharpay the mean girl from East High School to a nice girl trying to make it in New York City. She came a long from being Maddie Fitzpatrick from the Suite life of Zack and cody to Sharpay Evans from high school musical series and Savannah Monroe from hellcats. I don't know, where she'll be in ten years, she'll be just fine. Ashley Tisdale has the greatest resemblance of Gossip Girl Blake Lively and The Big Bang Theory Kaley Cuoco.."
3,A little disappointing,"Perhaps this book is a good resource for kids six and under, but my kids (ages 4, 6, 7, and 9) found it less enthralling than many other resources we have used. It gives adequate and comprehensive coverage of the historical period, but lacks meat, isn't a particularly engaging book. I have been somewhat of a fan of Susan Wise Bauer, but found this book disappointing."
1,History of the World,"Very boring, don't read before bedtime if you want to retain anything. We are a homeschooling family and my kids despised it. I couldn't get into it either. I'm sure there are better resources out there, just take the time and look around."
1,"A very bland and boring ""story"" of history","This author left out entire civilizations in this book - why? A ""Story of the World"" - at least any book claiming this title - should include the real story. One of the most important events in the history of the world for a person of any religious background is/was creation! This is left out of the book. This history is told in a childlike way with lots of little stories. The stories are a bit much and will bore the average child older than five years old. In all, this is a very, very simple view of history and should not be used for any parent wishing to really teach history to their children."
5,A great read!,"Here's a laugh-a-minute book that a friend loaned to me. I tried to put it down, but the mixture of humor, description of a truly beautiful area of the south and some complex characterization of the mostly female cast of characters, was too good to ignore for long.Sherrie Martin must have grown up in the south, because she nails some non-stereotypical qualities of southern women of all ages better than the ""Ya Ya"" author. There's still a real story of family dysfunction, and how these women work around it here, but author Martin manages to keep it light and let her story breathe.A great read by a great new voice!"
2,Not up to snuff,"As a fan of the hilarious ""Father Ted"" series, I had high hopes for the Christmas show. Unfortunately, the writing was just not as inspired as in other episodes, and more often than not, the jokes fell flat. Overall, it was surprisingly disappointing, with the one bright spot being an early scene with Ted, Dougal, and Jack visiting a department store to do some holiday shopping. Looking forward to the Complete Series 3 DVD being released in March (and on which this episode is included)..."
3,Starts out brilliant but....,I love Father Ted and have the complete DVD set. However...this particular episode has a split personality... The first half of the show makes you believe that this is the best Father Ted ever... It is brilliant and just the first half alone is probably worth watching.... but the last half was incredibly poor. It just becomes dull... which I have never seen any other Father Ted episode do.
3,Entertaining,"As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the Christmas Father Ted is not quite as funny or entertaining as the other Father Ted series. If you are new to Father Ted, purchase the other series first which are a bit better to see if you enjoy the humor. If you're a die-hard fan, you will want this in your collection and we found it entertaining and full of holiday cheer!"
1,Better luck next time,A poorly done tale of Botswana. There is no theme and little to redeem the herky-jerky series of interviews. Does not do justice to the opinion that McCall Smith has for Africa as expressed in his other books. Skip this one.
1,????????????????????,"Alright, at my local video game store i was looking through the bin of cheap games that no-one wants and i stumbled across it. I knew it was going to be crap, but i was bored and i got it for 4.99. When i started to play it is was really confused, the game has no real story line, it strays from a mob story to a homosexual love interest, im not kidding. There was one scene when the main character holds some guys hand and takes him into the bedroom and closes the door. It doesnt show anything, but from the sound effects i can gather that they arnt knocking pillars into the groung.After this i turned off the game and threw it out, i just couldnt understand what the hell was going on with this stuff, afterall it looked all knarly from the cover.I would say dont get it, but im not sure what tickles your fancy."
1,One of the worst games I have ever played.,This is proof that you should never judge a book by its cover or game case. I had some Crave Entertainment games back on the dreamcast days and thought the idea of this game was appealing and when I put the disc in the controls were so horrid I could not play it. The game could of been decent if the controls worked but there a slop of mess. Basically they wanted to rip you off with this game. Only positive out of this you could tell a kid here have a free mini frisbee. This game went from looking appealing on the box art to once you put it in the system its just plain appalling. Its pretty sad this game was even ever conceived but at least after five minutes with this game you will be able to appreciate a great shooter like Halo or Max Payne.
3,Good but not the best...,"I love the Muppet Show, I watched it when I was younger and got this tape. I was mostly looking forward to the one with Mark Hamill and found it was really stupid. Now I know why he never went beyond Star Wars (and as a fan of that trilogy that's saying something). However, the episode with Paul Simon was wonderful! Their rendition of Scarborough Fair was hilarious! The Raquel Welch episode wasn't bad, but not wonderful."
5,thought provoking eye candy,"This horror movie has everything you could ask for: a real insane asylum that's 100X scarier than any Hollywood set, top notch acting, moody atmosphere, chilling soundtrack and good pace (though it drags in a few places). There are no scantily clad teen girls running around ... instead we get an all male cast, most of whom are living on the knife's edge emotionally. The performances are taut and realistic. The only major complaint I have is the ending was a bit too contrived. Overall, one of the few movies I consider good enough to give as a gift."
4,Works,"Very effective horror film. It is long on atmosphere, and less on gore. Well written and acted, this is a hidden gem among small budget horror films. Starring David Caruso, this films involves a hazzard clean up crew that must clean out an old insane asylum that has been abondoned for years. The owner of the company took the job with impossible deadlines because his business is in trouble and he is completely stressed out by a new baby at home. Another worker is sleeping with the wife of another(Caruso) causing major friction. Yet another worker finds tapes in the basement of 9 sessions with a multiple personality case, and he finds himself drawn to the eerie tapes. So many things add layers to this film. You are never really sure what has happened until the very end. Watch this one in the dark with the sound up, and I guarantee the scratchy session tapes with the strange voices freak you out."
4,"""Flash Back""","I worked at Danvers State Hospital. Although this gothic old building was once beautiful, the dark corners, subterranean tunnels, and lost souls were legendary.This film effectively ""unearthed"" all my disturbing memories and creepy feelings. Well done!"
4,"scary, creepy, disturbing, effective.","one of the most effectively scary films I have ever seen, (and I love horror movies). This movie doesn't rely on blood and gore as such, but rather psychological tension for its thrills.Good performances by David Caruso and Josh Lucas anchor this film and keep it realistic and believable. If you enjoyed ""The Ring"" and its atmospheric doom, then you'll enjoy this. Best watched with all the lights off in your house."
4,"Chillings, Original, Thought-provoking","Session 9 is one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. It's made all the creepier when one realizes that the movie takes place in an actual, long-abandoned mental hospital with a controversial past. According to the commentaries, there was plenty of creepy elements in the hospital already, including strange graffiti messages. There is some division of opinion over the ending, which I won't spoil. But after repeated viewings, I think the ending is excellent, raising questions about human madness. The taped therapy sessions of a multiple-personality patient named Mary are especially chilling. Good performances, direction and set design."
5,I love this movie!,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. One of the best psychological thrillers that I have ever seen. The creepiness factor never diminishes for me. Even on repeated viewings, I am still captivated by it."
4,"Quite Good, But Deleted Scenes Should Have Been Left In","Session 9 is an atmospheric thriller that takes place in a creepy mental institution. It's unsettling to say the least. A work crew has been assigned to remove the asbestos from the old abandoned facility. The more time they spend there, the more the place gets under their skin and things start to go awry. I wish they would release this in an uncut version, because the deleted scenes would have added a lot to the movie. The scenes were cut because in previews, some audience members were confused about the identity of a female character. Check out the deleted scenes on the DVD and you'll see what I mean. Overall though, a good flick to watch late at night with the lights off."
2,"MANIPULATIVE AND MINDLESS ""THRILLER""","This overrated film suffers from a lack of cohesion and misleading subplots that add nothing to the film. For instance, the title SESSION 9 would make you think this mysterious session captured on reel to reel is at the heart of the movie. Ultimately, it's a Macguffin, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie. It's extremely slow paced and by the time something happens, it's hopelessly underdone. I can't fault the actors; they did their best with this stinker script. Peter Mullan, Josh Lucas and even David Caruso do their best, but it's a sinking ship me lads.As for the ""deleted scenes,"" who in the heck was this old lady running around? Can see why these scenes were deleted. Maybe the whole script should have been deleted and redone.If you must see, rent. Don't buy---the 2 stars if for the acting and some of the eerie photography."
1,FAILS TO DELIVER,I was very disappointed with this movie. There was too much profanity and too much gore - for my taste.It really had the potential to deliver a frightening story with it's location and atmosphere. Instead I felt that I had wasted my time watching it and it also left me feeling depressed.
1,BORING,"This movie is really boring. It's not good on atmophere, it has lousy acting, and terrible script and well this movies reeks on all levels. It is almost as dumb as Jack-O. This is not worth seeing, buying, or renting. You'll be a better person for not seeing this movie. Trust me you're not missing anything. Go back to the slasher flicks, because they are even more interesting than this moad of ...! Even Faust is a better choice than this load of filth!"
1,Huh???,"The photography of the outside of the building was beautiful; however,there was little effort put into character developmentment or plot. This is a highly disjointed movie that is anything but scary. The ending left nothing but questions. It's a crying shame as the setting could have led to a well-developed and remarkably frightening movie. If this was supposed to be one of the ""greats,"", I'd like to see the worst!"
2,Not recommended for light viewing,"I was surprised by all of the excellent reviews of this movie. Personally, I watch movies to be entertained and as a form of escape, not to have to interpret dreams and delusions in some vain attenpt to figure out what the characters are meaning or experiencing through their bizarre and undecipherable mind trips.I found the plot scattered, the music annoying, and the end totally worthless. Not enough information was given to the standard movie-goer to fully understand what was happening with the characters, and unless you are a psychotherapist yourself you would probably have a great deal of trouble figuring out what the heck is going on.I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with most of you. I didn't like this one at all and I can't recommend it."
2,Confusing and Boring,"I rented this movie (thankfully) because it looked like the type of suspense/thriller movie that I'd enjoy. I was wrong. The movie starts out asbestos cleaning crew that wins the bid for an abandoned insane asylum. What should be a straightforward job, is complicated by the personal histories of the crew. In particular, Hank is dating Phil's old girlfriend, and Gordon's new baby seems to be unnerving him more than should be expected. Things get more complicated as wanna be lawyer Mike plays the tapes from a former patient with multiple personalities, including the mysterious Simon who does not appear until Session 9, and as Hank disappears after finding some old coins.This was supposedly a horror film but I didn't find any chilling or frightening scenes."
2,Don't Believe The Hype!!!!!,"OK, This movie has gotten an average of 4 stars. DON'T FALL FOR IT! This movie STINKS!!!!! I made the mistake of purchasing the DVD after constant raves by friends and the majority of Amazon reviews. I guess I was too lazy to go out and rent it..I could have saved 15 bucks! I was expecting something like ""The Ring"" or ""The 6th Sense,"" but this movie is far from their league. I was expecting to get creeped out, but I spent most of my WASTED time WAITING for something to happen! I'm just surprised that I didn't fall asleep like some of the more right-on reviewers of this movie. You may not agree, but I do urge anyone to RENT before you decide to buy this one. HUGE disappointment!"
1,"Not exactly a ""perfect"" waste of time...","But if it were, that would be the only thing perfect about it. This movie is a stinker."
1,watch something else,ok it's about group of laboureres who get un-hinged by vibes and finding old case-notes in an abandoned looney-bin.The acting and dialogue is garbled i couldn't follow this movie at all.It just scrambled my brain for an hour or so.
2,"Slow start, couple good frights, stupid ending (spoilers)","Was REALLY disappointed in this film. Starts slowly, seems like a typical haunted-house set-up - old, disused, abandoned building where disturbing things happened once; whispers are whisped; noises are heard in the dark; people die. The end.The part where Hank is collecting his stash was very well-done, but nothing else in the film WAS. And the ending just went on and on and on with the stereotypical slasher stuff, gratuitously violent and, worst of all, in my opinion, decent, sympathetic people die, leaving me sad, not scared. Whoever wrote the script did a poor job.Do not waste your money/time on this poorly-done film."
1,Do not watch this movie.,It is horrible and it makes no sense at all. I feel depressed after watching it particularly wasting an hour on this film hoping there will be answers at the end but no!
2,Mixed Feelings,"Well, I ordered this DVD after I read a promising review on a horror movie website that I trust. I was actually kind of let down by this movie. The location was incredible, but that's about all I got out of it. I mean, I was expecting a fair amount of chills to crawl up my spine, and I got none, and I mean NONE! It's got a decent plot, but it drags on for too long and is just not what I expected. Also, this movie took place in way too much daylight, which killed the suspense for me. Things just really aren't that scary when the sun is shining. I wish I could have made a film in that location, because at least I could have made a film that was actually creepy."
2,You keep thinking this will get better,Overall I wasn't expecting much of this movie when I rented it out... so it's not so bad that I got what I expected!Really this movie is a horror movie that tries to be artistic and profound. Let's call it a horror movie for those who would be too embarassed to watch Child's Play.I didn't mind so much the slowness of the film but the fact that by the end of the film I felt as if I'd watched a 1.5 hour movie that really had nothing much to it. It was creepy in parts but the conclusion to the movie left me confused.When I watch a movie I at least like to be able to concretely understand the motives of the killer. Was he somehow related to the hospital? Was he possessed by the spirit of Simon (before or after he started renovating the hospital)? Why did his nephew not notice him carrying a knife and the fact that his suit was all bloodied?
2,Don't get this confused...,"...with a good movie. I was influenced by all of the insanely positive reviews for this film on here and other sites. Unfortunately I found this movie to be nothing above average - with mediocre acting, direction, and production values in general. David Caruso is even worse in this than he is on CSI: Miami!It's not creepy, nor is it suspenseful - it's just not good."
5,I'd have to say it's fairly effective,"If you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly, gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds, tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together, well, then this movie is definitely for you! It's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate and one that will likely creep the heck out of you if watched alone in the dark.And one thing this film doesn't have, unlike its Hollywood-ian counterparts like THE HAUNTING, is special effects. In fact, that's one of the greater things about this movie: it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances Another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme, and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen"
3,Could have been fantastic,"This story had all the elements to be an intelligent, low key thriller on the scale of ""Rosemary's Baby. Terrific location, good actors, unlimited story potiental. It just never seems to go anywhere. It's like having a birthday the day after Christmas, a big let down. I kept waiting for something horrible and mind bending to happen but it just didn't. Too bad."
5,Asbestos From Hell,"If you're looking for a blood-spattered hack fest, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you want to see one smart, scary, chilling, freaky film that literally relies on the very last line of the movie to blow you over, this is it. There's a strong 'Shining' influence here, but it's no rip-off. Everything here is right--from the performances to digital photography, the locations to the script. The mental hospital, much like the Overlook Hotel, is one of the biggest stars here; And while you have to wait for the major carnage to ensue, it's worth it; And it actually means something. Remember when movies actually took time to build into something? This one does. Or at least to me. The last line still sends shivers down my spine everytime I watch..."
2,a bit biased and overrated,"i was sorely disappointed after watching this movie. after reading all of your reviews,i thought it was gonna be one of the greatest suspense/horror movies i have ever seen. but that was far from the case. it wasnt even the slightest bit scary, although the building itself is pretty spooky.i guess i was expecting more of a ghost aspect, but that wasnt really what the movie was about, and that kind of ruined it for me. its definitely a psychological movie, but they made the whole ending too confusing.if your more of a fan of psychological movies and not true suspense or horror, then check this one out, otherwise, steer clear."
2,Maybe I Need To Watch It Again?,"Wow, how did this movie get so many great reviews? I found it to be a terrible movie. This movie was not creepy or scary to me. Not at all. The plot was silly. The ending was lame. The characters were annoying.I gave it 2 stars ONLY because David Caruso is in it and I'm willing to watch this movie again to see if maybe I missed what is so great about it the first time around. (Yes, I like to punish myself from time to time.) After all, I got suckered into buying the DVD on Amazon because of all the great reviews. I was excited to see a scary thriller, what I got was a bad movie that now I need to check out again in case I missed something good about it.Not worth your money, so don't buy it. It may be worth watching, but don't expect to be frightened at all."
1,Frighteningly Dull. Save Money. Choose Something Else.,"I can't believe how many people think this is a five-star scary movie. Too tedious to be a ""thriller"" and sooo boring there's just no chance for suspense. The eeriest parts of the film are actually in the deleted scenes, where it appears as if a scary movie had actually been made and then re-shot with the creepyness (and plot) removed. Even the ""star"" of the film, the Danvers Asylum itself, has it's potential as a dire and forboding edifice watered down by showing exteriors shot on a beauitful, sunny day. Some say the director was being 'ironic"". Irony is not scary. Neither is Session 9."
2,OVERRATED,A serious disappointment considering all the positive reviews. If you want to watch a VERY average B horror movie.......this one is for you.
2,It's just NOT a good movie..,"The storyline had potential but it wasn't carried out well. There are so many lulls in this movie that it's not even scary. There aretoo many pieces missing in the storyline that would make it a decent psychological horror movie, but it doesn't work as just a fun, gory scary movie either.. just not good."
3,Danvers State Mental Hospital in the buff,"This movie has an original story line, which made it interesting. However, the acting was wooden and the pace of the movie felt slow and plodding. I guessed part of the ending pretty early in the movie, which made getting to the conclusion feel even longer. The tapes that Mike finds really aren't explained or elaborated on, even though the movie is named Session 9, after the last ""shocking"" tape. The feel of the movie is definitely eerie, and haunting, with two cringe-worthy scary moments, when I really had to close my eyes. Otherwise, it was pretty mild. Very beautiful location and scenery of the Danvers State Mental Hospital, which I understand was torn down recently. I watched for Halloween, and felt a little let down when it was over. Not a bad movie, but not much of a horror film either."
1,Keith Urban Fantastic,"This one was a let down as I thought it would be really good....NOT.It was really a let down and kinda stupid story. That chair on the cover really had no place in the movie. I had thought of making a purchase of another that the trailer looked as creepy as the exorcist but that had a low rating and not good reviews, but that lookes even better than this to me, and that was called the ""The Posession"". I think I should have stuck with my instincts and followed my own advice and got that instead.....looked scary to me.Save your money on this one."
5,Pretty good.,"Great movie in my opinion. The twist ending was a big surprise and the movie was tense, scary, and suspensful. ;)"
4,A good one,"I saw this bad boy on the big screen and I had heard some good things about it, so I went out of my way to find it. Very good film with some damn fine acting. Creepy and fresh.See it soon.Barry"
3,Mystery at its best. Great story and even better ending.,"When I was informed of this film, I instantly expected it to be a dull, cheap and over the top slasher with cheap scares. For the films low budget its far from cheap. I found this film to be very interesting from start to finish. Excellent acting from a highly underated cast, excellent plot that was well told, no evidence of cheap scares anywhere and a little creepy in some places.This film was very chilling. It's brilliant story and puzzling characters hold it together like an old man with a new hip.I gave this movie 3 stars, even though it was very good I thought it needed a tiny bit more suspence and thrills. The musical score was very simple but in some places very constant and repetitive. Overall, a very good film to watch in the dark or at Halloween. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it yet."
3,bland but not bad,"I was reading about this film in the magazine from last year's ""Fantasia"" film festival in Montreal and it sounded intriguing. Much to my dismay this film turned out to be an unoriginal entry into the suspense/horror/thriller genre. The story is well written and the camera work/set design are pretty cool. I just found there were some loose ends, some areas of the film that should have been dealt with in more detail. This film could have been incredible but it ended up being so so."
1,not that good,this movie is very slow paced! and in my opinion there was only one scary part. the story didn't make much sense either. i wouldn't recommend it.
4,Surprisingly Good,"I bought this movie off of amazon after reading something about it. It's a completely unknown, psychological thriller that I couldn't find in any Blockbuster or Roger's Video, so I decided ""why not?"" and paid 15 bucks for it. Much to my surprise, it ended up being good. I haven't seen a movie that has genuinely scared me in years, mostly due to the fact that most horror movies tend to work off of the ""something-jumps-out-and-says-boo"" template. While this movie had a few of these scenes, they seem somehow different from the norm and actually made me feel uncomfortable and kept me up at night. However, the main way of bringing fear to the viewers is through the building of tension and the calm before the storm, which I have always loved. Overall, I would have to say that this movie could have been better if it had been a bit more frightening, but as far as horror movies go, it's one of the best I've ever seen."
4,Simon says......,"I think the editorial review of ""Session 9"" sums up the plot of this film best, so this reviewer wont go into any further detail regarding ""Session 9's"" storyline.This is a very atmospheric movie that keeps ya guessing the whole way through. Even if you think you know what's happening, you don't know why its happening until the very end.The strong all male cast (David Caruso, Stephen Gevedon,Paul Guilfoyle, Josh Lucas,Peter Mullan, Brendan Sexton III) each give fine performances as their characters slip further and further into the creepy madness of the Danvers Mental Hospital.A little slow throughout- but necessary to build suspense- (as with almost all thrillers) Session 9 delivers a nice 1-2 punch during it's final 30 minutes.An effective and creepy thriller.....Recommended!"
3,Passable,"I watched Session 9 last night on Netflix. Overall I think it's not bad but it's not the greatest either. The whole movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder which I didn't like, it made it feel cheap and low budget, if they used a proper motion picture standard camera then it would have added quality. The acting was great, good actors and interesting characters. I'm not going to spoil the story but I will say that it's basic, it starts off slow and picks up towards the ending, the ending was good but a little bit confusing. There was only 1 soundtrack that played off and on during the whole movie, it was good and creepy, and I applaud the sound effects.I would recommend Session 9."
3,Not All That,"Based on the glowing reviews here at Amazon, I was expecting much more from this psychological horror film.Ultimately I felt that the pieces of the story don't quite fit together.Nevertheless the film does offer one compelling reason to view it: the behind-the-scenes look at the now demolished Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts, home of the notorious prefrontal lobotomy and quite a remarkable piece of architecture.Those interested in mental health, history, and architecture may find this location alone worthy of attention. Those seeking a superior psychological thriller, however, can find much better examples than this film."
3,Session 9 review,"Well I thought Session 9 was pretty good; I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if that option were available. Liking movies that are more psychologically scary rather than gory, I'd say there were a few scenes in this movie that were very frightening. Unfortunately there was some gratuitous gore that I felt shifted the mood of the film a bit from atmospheric terror to slasher movie.I felt the cinematography and sound editing was excellent, and is worth watching for that alone.I suppose you could say that the effectiveness of a movie can be measured by how long it stays with you after you've finished watching it. I definitely thought about this movie for a while after I had seen it."
5,An actually scary film.,I love these kinds of films. In a day and age of Saw and other ridiculously over the top garbage this one hits all the right tones for me. I couldn't keep my eyes away. It builds up and doesn't let go. There are a few flaws in this one as with every production but I think they outdid themselves here with a small budget and that is why I am awarding it five stars. If you are brave enough to be this subtle you deserve it.
4,Not bad,This was a pretty decent horror flick. The story focuses on 5 men who are working on a closed down insane asylum and begin to experience weird happenings. There are a few scenes that will scare and or shock you. The music and setting is very creepy. I reccommend this movie if you enjoy horror movies that leave more to the imagination.
5,Excellent psychological thriller,"This movie ranks among my top five favorite suspense/thriller movies of all time (along with The Shining, Jacob's Ladder, Sixth Sense, and ... I can't remember the fifth but you get the idea). If you enjoy psychological thrillers, the ones that really get inside your head, this movie is for you. It seems to be a relatively low-budget film, given that I never saw it promoted at all, but that just makes it even more amazing that it's so well-acted and directed. It draws you in and gradually builds the horror until you're on the edge of your seat. I couldn't sleep for a week thinking I was going to hear that voice talking to me. Highly recommended for thriller buffs who are more keen on psychological terror than on gore."
3,Once upon a time Asylum,I found this movie a bit confusing at times...maybe the way it jumps to and from when he listens to the tapes...but knowing that it was set in a REAL once upon a time actual Asylum makes this movie all the more scary.
3,Yet another movie over-rated by the fine viewers of Prime.,"Wow.All I can say is, ""wow"". (To those who have over-rated yet again another movie)Folks? This movie is a 3-star caliber movie. Decent. Engaging enough to warrant the 1.5 hours of your time, with some solid substance here, but not much more.4-star? lol...uh, no.Semi-creepy atmosphere, decent acting, and some ""mystery & unsureness"" about what's going on, but that's it. Period.3-Star movie, and honestly? I recommend you fine folks start tracking my reviews if you truly want the most precise & accurate ""reading"" on where a movie ""falls"" into this 5-star rating system.Clearly others are just wrongfully & laughably tossing around 4 and 5 stars towards movies that aren't even close to being at that level of quality."
1,Very disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this movie; I love horror movies, esp. haunted house movies and have worked in state mental hospitals and know how very creepy they can be. I was really, really disappointed. This movie had so much potential with a great setting and a good cast. The characters were quite two dimensional and cliche. The plot was confusing at times, slow and silly. A movie can be very suspenseful without overt violence with a slow, building pace; but that's not the type of slow this movie was. This movie was a major letdown and I would recommend anyone who still has a desire to see it, wait till you get it on cable."
3,potential not reached,"As a devotee of abandoned asylum websites, I found this film disappointing. The plot is interesting, in a 'what just happened...hang on...rewind that bit...Huh??... way. Make sure smarter people than you are watching the film so they can explain it to you at the end. Loose ends are hangin'. Much more creepy music, use of the site and bizarre camera angles were needed to make this film the best it could be considering that Danvers (was) the most atmospheric old loony bin in New England. I got a bigger chill looking at photographers stills of this grand old building on Opacity."
1,Don't waste your money,"After having read the various reviews I thought that this would be a great, yet spooky, movie to watch with a group of friends. Well, to put it bluntly, it was the most ridiculous thing I think I've ever seen and one of my friends wanted to know who to send the invoice to for wasting two hours of her life!! The creepiest part of the DVD is the cover!!"
3,Danvers State Hospital,"I rented this movie because I am from Mass originally and had never heard of Danvers state. I must say some parts are a bit confusing...But all ties together in the end..what I liked mosy about it was the DVD version has Extras, They speak with the actors who actually were very creeped out to work in this place.I think its well worth renting and giving it a whirl...The whole abandoned Mental Hospital is creepy in itself!"
1,Boring!!,"Short and Sweet...I found myself waiting desperately for something to happen,and it never does. Not scary,not interesting, I really dont get all the hype"
1,Chocolates we received were very old.,"The chocolates we received seemed to be about a decade old. The chocolate was stale and discolored and the formerly soft center had turned hard and powdery. Bad, very bad."
1,STAY FAR AWAY,"THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER THE CHOCOLOATE TASTED BAD. THIS IS THE SECOND CHOCOLOATE PRODUCT I HAVE BOUGHT FROM THIS COMPANY AND NOTHING BUT DISAPOINTMENT SO IF ITS MADE BY ""MANHATTAN CHOCOLOATE"" EXPECT OLD STALE AND DOWN RIGHT NAUSEATEING CHOCOLOATE IF I COULD RETURN IT I WOULD BUT YOU HALFTO OPEN IT AND TASTE IT FIRST SO YOU CANT RETURN IT IF THERE IS A WAY TO GIVE SOMETHING A NEGITAVE 5 STARS ALL OF MANHATTAN'S CHOCOLOATE'S PRODUCTS WOULD GET IT IT IS A SHAME THAT AMAZON EVEN HAS THIS TRASH FOR SALE(AND I AM TRYING TO BE AS NICE AS I CAN WRIGHTING THIS)"
3,Description,"Sara would have traded her fortune for some privacy...Sara Chance was a jet-setter. As the wealthy widow of the beloved Maxwell Chance, she led a glamorous, opulent life. Yet Sara was miserable. All the money in the world couldn't make up for her not being able to appear in public unrecognized.

And then Sara's diamond engagement ring disappeared. As the danger mounted, Sara turned to Sam, only to find out how badly she'd been deceived!"
4,1960s social reforms in the US,"The book looks at the social reforms in the US during the 60s. Emphasising the urban planning and 6 demonstration programs that were funded by the federal government. These programs are scrutinised for their effectiveness, typically in redressing some societal ill. The programs were in New York, San Francisco, Boston and other cities. Note that all the locations were major cities, with high profile problems to be solved.The programs are related to 3 models of management used to run them."
1,Have to laugh...,"I just have to laugh at all the people commenting on the ""graphic"" nudity in the original version. Make the show ""family friendly"" by editing out the ""graphic"" nudity - but by all means leave the ""graphic"" violence in... God forbid that while the little kiddies are watching a show where people are shot, blown up, and these creepy worms crawl into a person's neck and control that person to do evil deeds that the little kiddies will be completely and unalterably corrupted by seeing boobies briefly... As for pubic hair, it looked like a mohair bikini... A true bikini would have left less to the imagination...I think people have their priorities more than a bit screwed up.Don't misunderstand. I'm a longtime Stargate fan, but I'm not going to bother with purchasing this one unless it has some actual redeeming qualities other than ""no nudity"" and wouldn't be showing this to the little kiddies due to the other themes before I worried that a boobie might frighten them."
5,This is a great refurb,This cut of the original pilot for Stargate SG-1 removes dialog and scenes that don't quite fit with the rest of the series and adds some scenes and lots of little things that hint at what was to come. I thought it did a better job of setting up the character of Jack O'Neill.
2,This is a cut not the Final,"So many titles come out today with the Final Cut, Director's Cut, etc. This edition carries the story from syndicated broadcast, not the original Showtime version. I was disappointed that the original version, only available on VHS, has not been released. It was the VHS version that sold me on the series. Sure the original Showtime version was for adults with the nudity, but it was from Showtime. What do you expect? They pretty much toned down the series after the pilot movie, but the money was raw and inavaitive to set itself apart from the theatrical movie. I recommend that if you want to see the original episode as it was written and aired, get the VHS version. Hopefully they will release the original version on DVD as the Original Cut or something like that."
3,It's okay if you don't watch the 1st season first,"It's okay if you don't watch the 1st season first , no other coment . . . . . ."
4,Love anything Stargate,"This movie kept true to the series, and at least expanded the series one more episode. Too bad they don't make more of the movies, since the series is gone."
1,No Point In Bothering With This One.,"The original cut was edited as a *movie* and could access deeper emotions using that editorial liberty. So, what's the point in shooting a *movie* if it is just going to be re-edited (as in ""Final Cut"") to be simply a long TV show? I wish they would release an ""Original Cut"" version for those of us who prefer it. Oh well, I guess they don't get any money from me...and judging from the lackluster star ratings here, I see that they are passing up on accepting the money of alot of eager fans. Sad."
2,Fairly disappointed,"I rented the movie to decide whether or not I would want to buy it. As others have said, it was rushed. All the scenes or dialogue that ingratiated the characters to the audience had been removed. There was one memorable line about having to, ""McGyver"", something, (said in front of O'Neill) in the original, that was removed. Little inside jokes like that were what the fans liked about the series. I would not buy it. The original included in the series is superior."
2,let us GATE to the skies!!,"hey, i knew this ""redo"" was out there, but it really didn't seem to offer much. a friend of mine got it ""on a whim"", as he put it. we both thought it is a poor product, just a money making scheme. as someone who has bought the entire series box, (POORLY packaged), i personally thought of this ""redo"", as insulting to the series. i think the series as a whole, has wonderful offerings. i really enjoy watching almost every show. my wifes name is janet, so i like to hilite the shows with the doc. but this remake of the first show, just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
3,No Bad,"It's OK, but I prefer the takes used in the original. They seem stronger to me. Plus, a lot of the humor was removed."
2,Gone too far.,"Don't waste your money. They took out the Macgyver reference. They took out the ""reproductive organs"" line. Major Matt Mason. The nudity, that underscored how demeaning and brutal the G'ould where and countless other dialog. Some FX are redone and that is cool, but the editing just went to far.I am a Huge SG-1, Atlantis, Stargate the Movie fan and even tried to watch the animated series. I do not write these words easily.Again, Don't waste your money. Crack open your Season 1 DVDs and watch it again.Stargate SG-1 Season 1 (Thinpak)"
5,Children of the Gods - Excellent,"If you are a fan of Stargate, then this is a must see and a must have for your collection."
1,It's like colorizing an old movie,"For real Stargate SG-1 fans, watch the original release pilot in the season 1 DVD pack. This digitally re-mastered version may look slightly more crisp, but the deleted scenes are not worth the added scenes that were cut from the original. Stargate should concentrate on new movies with fresh content and not try to pedal remakes of TV episodes. The hoopla over this being something ""very"" special is overrated. Those who rate this remake as great need to watch all 10 years worth of episodes twice and then re-consider their review. It is worth watching, but it is not worth buying if you have the original."
3,SG1 Children of the Gods,"Didn't notice any difference between the original one and this one, except they cut out the full frontal neudity."
5,"A New Vision, Not Leftovers","Although there were those who blasted George Lucas for improving on the original Star Wars trilogy, I found both it and the Children Of The Gods very entertaining. I must admit there were a few parts that I felt shouldn't have been tampered with, but overall, it was a fresh, fun ride. If you are a true Stargate fan, this DVD is a must for your collection. The new cut is a tighter, more focused version that doesn't suffer from Showtime's preoccupation with nudity. I'm not someone that needs a family friendly version, I know how to fast forward past scenes that are not for children, but this was really just a better version. It really was what the creators intended."
1,Can I have my money back!,"I guess they needed the money because this stunk.The best way I can describe it is a re-run.I'm sure you geeks are going to watch it 20 times to see the little changes but I don't want to waist my life looking for them. Save your money and don't think twice. This reminds me of a cheap B movie, i'm sure you'll see it in a couple of month's on the new SyFy channel for free."
2,why not blue ray of this chapter 1 /pilot????,"One star. I don't get the idea to re-release this chapter, It would have been a succes in Blue ray.. shame.........I like the new artwork."
1,"It was a Showtime series, people","For all those repressed people out there who seem completely clueless: the series was a Showtime series for the first five seasons. Showtime, you know, that subscription TV channel that you pay for? Hence, they actually wanted people to watch it, get hooked, etc. Action, violence, nudity etc. Did any of you ever even see the feature film? I'm all for people getting into the series from syndication and from Sci Fi re-runs, but that's not where the show started. Editing the pilot and removing anything is a mistake, and takes away from the original concept. I'll wait to see this when it's on Netflix, and save my $$$ for something worth it."
2,Milking the SG-1 fans with old material,"Another futile attempt by MGM to garnish even more out of SG-1 fans... they've ran out of ideas, and most of the actors are burnt out on this show. So they did even worse than the equivalent of releasing a greatest hits album.... they remastered the pilot episode and gave it the appearance of a feature film. Save your money, unless you're a die hard SG-1 nerd and you need this to sleep at night.If they wanted to make a killing, they'd go back to doing two more feature films based on the original 1994 movie, with the original cast. I liked the SG-1 series (until MacGyver left), but its all used up - and this is exactly why most series don't go this long... the feature films would get real movie goers, right along with the nerds."
1,Don't waste your money,"After watching the movie I had to watch the special feature to find out what was changed. I didn't notice anything. Wow they changed the music.Who cares. Wow they changed the look of the stargate puddle. Still looked the same to me. The stuff they changed makes no difference in viewing pleasure.If you're looking for new effects like they did for Star Wars, it isn't here. And what little re editing was done doesn't make it worth buying.Wait for it to run on SyFy channel."
2,What gives?,"I'm all for re-releases but in this case you can buy the seasons individually for [...] at walmart.I bought it last year and the nudity is in it.I may be mistaken but I thought Atlantis was doing well,as well,still trying to grip with why they cancelled both!!!!Plots get stale...blah blah blah....but both shows were still worth watching....cant speak for other fans but they are still a great escape from my day-to-day grind......I got all of both series on dvd.A-Dam"
2,If they were serious about taking out the controversal elements,"My viewing of this recut version of the original pilot is mixed. I have never minded the nudity of the original. Like another here who mentioned it, it was necessary to show exactly what Apophis and the Goa'uld thought of their ""slaves."" But, if they thought it was necessary to take out the nudity here, why not go back and take out the rape scene from ""The Broca Divide,"" or insert Apophis' lines (editing deadlines made it impossible to get Peter Williams in to remix his lines, so whenever he's on the screen, his mouth moves, but nothing comes out, making the episode almost impossible to watch despite introducing one of the Four Ancient Races) in ""The Nox."" If this recut was so important to Brad Wright, then he wouldn't mind making the rest of the series into a G-rated borefest.To be honest, this recut is unnecessary and just a way to take some more money out of the fans' pockets."
2,Watch The Original,Being a huge fan of Stargate I was disappointed watching this. After watching it I went back to the Season 1 DVD set version. The scenes 'added' and 'replaced' do not add anything to the story and in fact detract from it. In their enthusiasm to change a scene they even clipped Jack O'Neill's line towards end of the movie. They show Tealc slowly 'shaking his head' in disapproval - that was not in the original. I didn't find the video quality any better. I almost get the impression they did this to keep interest up in Stargate because of upcoming movies including Stargate Universe. I would recommend sticking to the Season 1 DVD set so you can have a better pilot and the start of the series.
2,What were they thinking?,"I just watched the movie and I kept waiting for some new scenes that would justify the ""re-imagining"". Boy, was I disappointed. Not only was there not enough new material to justify making a new movie, but some important scenes were omitted, including the nuditiy scenes and the scene where Kowalsky gets invaded by a goauld, just to name a few. Cutting these scenes removes important cues and clues from both the movie and the series that follows. There isn't enough new material to come even close to justify saying the movie is ""re-imagined"". What were they thinking? I am seriously disappointed and will think twice before falling for this line again."
2,"No improvement over the original, no worse either","If you already have the original cut of the SG-1 pilot on DVD as part of a season set, don't bother buying this one. If you don't have it and don't want to buy a whole season, go ahead and get this one.Apart from removing the brief nude scene (whether that's an improvement or not is up to you) the changes are so trivial that they just make no real difference at all. The new special effects are well done, but the original special effects were just as good. It's interesting to see the extra lines of dialog here and there (none are whole new scenes, just fragments of scenes) but makes little overall difference.In summary: it's slightly different from the original but not in any way that makes it better, worse, or worth having both in your library. I give it two stars against the overstated promise of real differences."
4,Good Source for Exegesis,"O'day has put together much scholarship about the Gospel of John. Her thesis is that to preach it, you must preach the way John preaches, using his timing and characters and letting the congregation in on the story as it comes from John. This is fine, but...there may be other ways that the Gospel speaks to us in this era that are not bound by the structure of John's Gospel as it is written. Scripture has the power to mediate many more messages than were intended by the original writers. I do think it is important to sort things out with John and not just go off on a tangent, however. The passages she uses are a very small part of the actual Gospel and her sermons are interesting, but not necessarily moving."

3,"I'm sure this is exactly what it's supposed to be, but I didn't like the taste",I tried making my own version of cafe au laite but really couldn't get a decent blend going. It's probably good for people who know what they're doing but I obviously don't :)
2,The Librarian of Basra,"Alia Muhammad Baker also known as The Librarian of Basra by Jeanette Winter tries to save her books from the war that is going on in Iraq. She hides them in different locations. (houses, restaurants, buildings) To Alia her books are the most valuable objects in her life. She loves to read and learn new things. Alia soon hears people talking about the war and soldiers fill the street, dropping bombs, and people are dying. All she can do is wish for the best and dream for peace.I think this would be a good book to read to mature kids. Especially when Iraq just had an Election and is going through a war. This book had interesting, creative paintings with wonderful colors that set the mood."
5,A rare portrayal of a strong Muslim woman,"There are many wonderful things about this book which have already been mentioned by 27 of the other reviewers. However, what struck me the most was that Alia Muhammad Baker, the main character of The Librarian of Basra, is a strong Muslim woman who becomes a heroine in her struggle to preserve her faith and country's heritage at her cherished library.This is very critical considering that most readers of this book probably view Muslim women as oppressed and passive as opposed to strong and committed to their faith.Anyone who wishes to offer a more balanced presentation of Muslim women in their classroom or to their children should get this book and read it themselves and to kids."
3,THE LIBRARIAN OF BASRA - JEANETTE WINTER,The Librarian of Basra is a book that helps kids understand the war in Iraq. It is a nice story. I recommend this book for all ages. BUY! BUY! BUY! YEAH!
1,Feel Good Nonsense,"This books is at best feel good nonsense for brain-washed kids. At worst, this is a traitorous pamphlet.Worst of all, though, is that it is a boring story that tries to brainwash kids and make them lefties."
3,Family Fun,This was an inexpensive and enjoyable family game. Easy to play for all ages and even a little addictive for it's scoring.
2,Just Not Good Enough,"I'm not a pinball expert or anything but I always enjoyed video game pinball ( not the simulations of real machines ) and I thought I should give this a try anyway despite the fact that this is, afterall, a sim. I was wrong. Only two of the tables are any fun ( Black Hole and Tee'd Off ) and I just don't care about the history of the machines in general or Gottlieb in particular. Some may argue the older tables ( 50's, 60's ) require more skill and finesse, but I just found them to be dull and somewhat tacky. And only two worthwhile tables for $20 just doesn't cut it. I recommend these instead: Extreme Pinball for The Playstation, Pure Pinball for the X-Box, The Pinball of the Dead for the GBA ( macabre and creative! ), and even Dragon's Revenge for the old Sega Genesis."
1,Simply didn't work,Send it to my mother in europe for a foot massager bought in the state.The thing simply didn't work.
2,Weak prongs,"I bought and received this very same item from another seller.The converter came with its prongs bent almost 45 degrees downward. When I carefully straightened the prongs with pliers, the damage seemed undone. Not so: shortly afterward, one of the prongs broke off. There is a similar review on the Amazon website for the Proctor-Silex product, which looks remarkably like Conair's."
4,Should work,"Bought to take to the Azore Islands but the trip didn't work out this year, maybe next year. Had this set before years ago and has enough connectors to work just about anywhere. No, I haven't plugged it in yet other than here in the US but what is that testing? Didn't heat up when I plugged in a battery charger through it for 16 hours and recharged all my camera batteries. Didn't heat up when I recharged my beard trimmer for 12 hours and my wife's cell phone overnight. Didn't try any big stuff but didn't buy it for that..."
2,disappointing,"this ring was shiny and sparkling when it arrived, but soon turned dull. I've cleaned it with no luck. It wasn't worth returning, but doubt I'll wear it much because it looks tacky."
2,Quickly became useless,"My experience with this battery was not as good as the first reviewer. Initially, it gave me 4-6 hours of continuous work. I was able to give a 2.5 hour lecture on one charge, easily. Slowly, the battery started deteriorating and after 10 months the work time was down to one hour."
1,Golf jokes - recycled,The book reads like a compendium of golf jokes gathered while drinking beer with your friends at the local pub.Understanding some of the dry wit is similar to trying to comprehend an inside joke...while being on the outside.I would not recommend this title.
4,Another obcession to admit to,"Unlike a George Carlin humorous rant at everything and everything, it's tough maintaining a high level when dealing with only one subject. That's why this book has its hilarious ups and somewhat tedious downs: from practicing your swing in elevators (I personally like bathroom mirrors while dripping wet) to the Bobby Jones chapter. But overall, well worth reading especially for AA members who have the double whammy of being hooked on the game and will really appreciate the tongue in cheek comparison."
4,husband loves it,My husband loves it. The leather is nice and it holds alot of stuff. But with a lot of use the two front leather straps curl up.
3,An Early Bronfenbrenner Book,"This early 1970s book contains some underpinnings of his Ecological Systems Theory, but I would recommend only reading it in the library.Just stick to THE ECOLOGY OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT."
3,Doesn't fit all oven racks,"I just received this thermometer today. It seems to read the temp ok (my oven is pretty new, so still pretty accurate). However, the clip does not fit around the rungs of my oven racks - the clip is much too small. My husband wired the clip onto the oven rack and then inserted the thermometer into the clip, and that seemed to work. But that leaves out the option of mounting the thermometer on top of the rack - I can only have it hanging below the rack. It makes it a bit difficult to read. I'd send it back, but I need it for some baking I'm doing tonight and need the oven to set at exactly the right temp. I have a 2005 Frigidaire professional series gas range."
5,The best Dry Rubs on the market!!!,We have been using the Char Crust rubs for years. They are the best dry rubs on the market!!!
4,a good book,This book itemizes the related theorems and covers most major results. It would be better if some definitions have some more detailed examples.
4,DO NOT READ THIS PLEASE! IT COULD SAVE LIVES!,"I think I bought this book only because it had that neat Moor Methodesque presentation. And because I like to buy math books. And because it was cheap.So far so good, though I can't say that it differs particularly from any standard text on algebra. It's not big enough to be Lang. Not terse enough to by Hungerford. And not comprehensive enough to be Dummit and Foote.It also costs about a fifth of the price of any of those and has a neat do-it-yourself kind of methodology."
2,Good Book but Dense,"This is a good book, but very dense. There is very little motivation; I found the proofs difficult to follow. If you have a graduate degree in Math you will probably be ok, but otherwise I'd keep away."
3,Wine gold nuggets,Consider this book a must for any serious wine lover.I enjoyed to get the inside thoughts and informationfrom a few wine rock stars.
4,"Glasses, Grasses, Soil, Stones, People & Places","It's a journey not a destination. Cliche'd but in this if you're looking for rankings of wine or learning in the academic sense this is not for you. If you are a farmer of anything that grows in fields you'll like it. If you enjoy wine - sit and relax and drive with Lawrence (gives you a bit of a wobbly to experience so much driving after the vineyard tasting room)to the next spot on his journey. Critics with a distaste for language or wry humour do not appreciate the writing - but if that doesn't sound like you, well... you'll enjoy the journey and the history and personality of the wine makers on every page."
2,Pointless and Meandering,"I'll read most any book about wine, but this one truly was ill-conceived and quite literally pointless. Indeed, the author effectively concludes that the whole exercise of the book makes no sense. He admits that he has learned nothing about wine during his ""journey"" and, hence, conveys nothing. The book also contains a host of factual errors, which were distracting until one reaches the point in the book when one realizes that there really isn't much there for these flaws to detract from - at which point you just let them pass like so much of the author's meanderings. Why was this perhaps workable first draft rushed to print? Why didn't the editors work with the author to craft some type of thesis for or framework around the all the disjointed reportage? They could have done some fact-checking while they were at it too. But they didn't. As a result, this book is really half-baked - or, if you will, not nearly fully fermented."
4,Classic Muppets,"The muppets are great! If you agree, you'll like this DVD. Each of these three episodes had great gags, and all of the key muppets of the era are humorously involved (Though Fozzie gets less attention than the others). The only thing keeping me from giving this a full five stars were a few odd unfunny skits (I don't care for the Jug Band) and a laughtrack which I felt was sometimes distracting. On the plus side, three entire episodes are included, and each has a brief introduction by Brian Henson. Though not perfect, this muppet release has some great moments. My favorites were: Sam the Eagle's editorial, Gonzo playing ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"" on the bagpipes, and the always popular Pigs in Space."
5,marco,"Too bad most Americans don't know about this fabulous star from Mexico. He can out-write and out-sing anybody, and he's also incredible in concert. I've been to six of them so far."
1,Hayden 5806 Tensioner Compatibility,"Please note that the Hayden Automotive 5806 Automatic Belt Tensioner is NOT compatible with the 1995-1997 Lexus LS400. The problem is that the lower right timing belt cover does not sit correctly on this tensioner due to the fact that the dimensions are incorrect. The other tensioner that is not compatible is the Goodyear 49241 Gatorback. The tensioner I found (on Amazon) to be an exact match is the Gates 39080.As you can tell, I have tried 3 different tensioners. The Gates 39080 performs as good as the OEM tensioner. You will not be disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money!,"YUCK! The first edition of this book is infinitely superior! Most of the recipes are identical (but some of the best are missing from this), and it is nowhere near as attractive or nicely presented.Clearly, this piece of garbage was rushed to press to make money from people who don't know any better. Do yourself a favor and buy the original instead (right here on Amazon!)."
3,Homedics Therapy Pillow,"Out of the box, the pillow seems like it would form easily around your head. Unfortunately, that was not the case. You need to work at forming the pillow to a comfortable position.I have neck and back problems and have used the one that is made of the stuff they claim was used in space. That one is much more comfortable. Maybe in time the the HoMedics pillow will soften up?"
2,Disappointment!,"At first this pillow feels wonderful between your hands. The microbeads move freely. But once you lay it down on your bed and lay your head on it, it feels like a rock. It doesn't form around my head. I used it for a week to try and get used to it but every morning I woke up with a stiff and painful neck. I don't recommend this pillow and think it's a waste of your money."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT,"THE PILLOW IS TO HARD, AND LEAVES ME WITH A HEADACHE IN THE MORNING! BUT IS GREAT FOR A NURSING PILLOW FOR THE BABY"
1,I wanted to love this pillow...,"It looks incredibly comfortable and in fact, it even feels that way when you touch it. The way that it molds to your hand gives the impression that it will provide the best night's sleep possible. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard when you actually use it for sleep.As someone who sleeps on my stomach, it is even more painful. If I slept on my back I think it would be a little bit better, but I could never see myself using this on a regular basis.Also of note, the fact that this is only sold in standard size a bit disappointing.I thought that this could finally be the pillow to take the place of my old (and falling apart) foam rubber pillow that I've been using for 20 years...but it seems that my search will continue. Does anyone still make the classic style pillow made with heavy foam rubber? The closest I can find is a latex foam pillow, which has the same kind of sleep, but is way too light."
4,Excellent Pillow!,I have now purchased three of these pillows. The best prices found anywhere were here at Amazon. The pillow is comfortable summer and winter and it holds its shape. I like it so much that I bought a third one to keep in the car for overnight trips.
1,HoMedics Micropedic Therapy Pillow - NOT,"This pillow is not nearly as comfortable as I expected. I don't see that my neck/spine were kept straight, infact my neck and sholders felt stiff. I always awoke with my head and neck feeling hot and sweaty. This pillow didn't feel cool, as it is advertised. I'd not recommend the HoMedics Micropedic Therapy Pillow!"
5,True To Form,"This shoe was the exact replica of what was presented in the advertisement. Very comfortable good looking show, that wiill surely turn heads."
2,Only for people who already understand ATM,"I regret buying this book. Its exposition of the basic concepts is poor. In the section on AAL5, for example, the author digresses into detail only of interest to experts whilst explaining the basic concepts. This book has a VHAD (Very High Acronym Density). Although the book includes a glossary and a list of acronym expansions they are both incomplete. The author needs to work through the entire book line by line and make sure every acronym is in the list of acronym expansions or better still the glossary. If you understand ATM already though, there is a wealth of information here."
3,Oops...,"I wish I had known more about this book and the author before I bought it. I was looking for subject matter for our Bible Study, and the reviews were encouraging. However, I did not know that this book was written from the perspective of a transcendentalist. The content IS good, but it does not have the Biblical backing in content that I had been hoping for. This book will still be useful, but it's going to take some work on our part to make sure the points are Biblically sound."
3,Disappointment,"I loved KZ1, and as many have already said was eagerly waiting for KZ2, but the gameplay is horrible, and the controls are uncontrollable. I simply can't understand why people love this game so much. Granted graphics are awesome, but this game is dropping frames in a disgusting manner. I mean when the action gets very intense the game slows down and even drops seconds off the game, this is simply unacceptable, not for a game with such a good storyline and potential. BUY THIS USED !!!!!!! you are wasting your money if you get it new."
3,Eh well it's fun for awhile,"Just another shoot to me, I'd rather play Call of Duty so this is going on the shelf, I haven't even beaten it. I got bored."
4,the graphics are top notch but.........,"this game graphic wise is definitely entertaining, but the game controls and the extent of attachment to the reality in this game is sort of sucking the fun out of vidoe gaming. the only one machine gun feature in this game is so off putting and the no crouching option is unacceptable.The game cairtenly doesn't deserve a less than 4 stars rating but it also doesn't deserve a 5 star rating."
2,FPShooter Need A Mouse and Keyboard,"First time I took the plunge and bought a FPS for console PS3 and while the game is good overall, the game play takes a hit due to the sluggish controller. Mouse and Keyboard!!!"
2,Disapointing,"Tried getting used to the controls but just couldnt do it. I tried the other control schemes but none seem to work for me. Online games are laughable and just flat out boring. The story wasnt even worth it. Im looking forward to any updates to make this game more enjoyable, until then I will continue playing COD: 4."
5,"oh hi, i barely noticed you there",i liked the game alot. It was very fun and had amazing graphics even though it came out in 2009. I believe black people will enjoy this game VERY much!
2,"PS3, It's not you, it's me","I own both a PS3 and XBOX 360 and I think therein lies the problem. I've noticed many of the PS3 exclusives have their own feel. I enjoyed Resistance--it felt tight enough.This game is beautiful. I ordered it as soon as it came out and had high hopes. Maybe it's just me, maybe it's the game, maybe it's the PS3 controller--but I hate the control scheme. The aiming felt loose and problematic--no where NEAR as tight as COD4 or Left 4 Dead.Again--if this is a ""PS3"" versus ""XBOX"" feel it might be more to your tastes. As I said, it's a first rate game, production wise.I just didn't find myself having fun playing it.Also--they went to great effort to make you feel into the game--so you get camera shake as you're walking. I appreciate the effort, but it gave me motion sickness. I haven't had a game do me like that since Doom--which I still can't play for extended periods."
1,Step down from the original,"Graphic superiority can't suplant the better storyline and gameplay options of the original. Bottomline, not allowing a variety or character classes to choose from such as shadow marshal or field agent kills this game in my opinion. You're forced to play a character with next to no depth in a scenario that pales in comparison to the original. I traded in this game with no hesitation after a single play through whereas I have played the original again recently and in my opinion is still far superior even with the numerous glitches. Unless you're a teenager or have the mentality of one, ignore this sequal and hope they get it right in the third installment, though that is probably unlikely seeing as how I have yet to see any critics or players have the same issues that I have with Killzone 2. This title is dead to me."
3,Yet another great game marred by technical inferiority,"Great game with tons of FPS action and incredible graphics, yet sadly it's just another member of the ""almost"" club (the membership list is growing frustratingly long). Like Fallout 3, Tomb Raider Underworld, and many other recent PS3 titles, Killzone 2 is marred by technical glitches ranging from sluggish movement and awkward controls to slow screen refreshes and short freezes. These aren't once-in-a-while issues, they're constant. I for one am really getting sick and tired of great games that fall way short of the mark because of dumb technical glitches. Come on folks, spend the extra time polishing these games before release, or at the very least send out a few patches (today, not a year from now)."
2,Horrible controls,Visuals are great. Sound is great. Controls HORRIBLE!! When you try and look right or left it's sluggish at first then speeds up. What happens is u over look your target. aiming and shooting a gun during a 8.0 earthquake is what shooting is like.
5,Excellent,"Best FPS played in ages. Addictive and fun with some COD4 and TF2 mixed together. Not innovative, but awesome."
5,This game is freaking insane,"Okay I am just going to say that this is the best game on the playstation 3It has a great campaign and online.The campaign is great from its gameplay, graphics, and its just fun.The gameplay is fun because when you go into cover you stay in it the whole time which is different but in a good way. You can tweak the controls to fit you so it will play very well. The graphics are just insane period.The online is great from the graphics, multiple classes and weapons, and the game. The game you will play is called warzone and it consists of about 5 different games which will always keep it different.So it is just good and if you are still not sure at least go out and rent it so you will see that it is worth the money."
5,"Holy Crap, It's Terrific!","If you haven't picked up Killzone 2 yet, then do so now! This game lives up to all of it's high scoring reviews. Sony has done it again. It always takes Sony 2 years before you see the power of their gaming console, and killzone 2 is by far the best looking game this generation. I have all three systems and the PS3 is my favorite.The enemies aren't super easy to kill like most games, the animations are great and the battles are intense! I don't know what you're waiting on. Get it now!"
4,Controller,"Just got the game. Overall the best FPS on PS3 by far.But could someone please tell my why I'm playing a super cool next-gen game with a controller that essentially debuted in 1994, then in '97 was updated with the most awkward of joystick placement?"
3,Ok but better than Kill zone 3,"The multiplayer is better than KZ3's and the game is still very beautiful to look at, I would recommend getting this game as long as it is under or right at $10. Also the story is somewhat engaging and the AI is very good and presents a challenge."
5,A perfect wedding gift to piss off any new wife!!,"So I already had this game and absolutley love it. I am in the Air Force and my new troop is getting married. I bought this game for him just so I would have someone I know to play with, instead of someone in another country. Since he was getting married I used this as an excuse to get it for him. He used to play Call of Duty and he says this game is hard, but awesome and very addicting. Slowly but surely I will get everyone I know addicted to this so I can challenge them on here and kick some but. Reno"
3,Great atmosphere; disappointing play,"The game is visually stunning, and the environment rich, but this cannot make up for the ""bobbing"" and the very loose controls. Very precise shots are needed for this game (as enemy soldiers either take a head shot or 100 regular shots), and it is very difficult with the looseness of the controls.May be good if you only have a PS3, but if you own an XBox360, skip this and buy Gears of War 2."
5,worth the 60 bones,pros:great graphicsgreat campaigngreat soundmultilayer is deep and funcons:controls are a little sluggishthe game makes me want to throw away all my other fps:( lol j/k
2,What's with the dialog?,"The dialog for these games are getting worse and worse. Listening to all of the cursing makes me think of the leftovers dropped on the Deadwood dialog cut-list (Yes that bad!). I guess the dialog's purpose is to make you feel like a tough guy. Instead, it makes me feel like I'm in middle school, using the ""F"" word for the first time, getting away with it, and then making sure it's used again in every sentence. The game play is okay, the online play is below average (compared to other online shooter games). Would I buy it again? No way! I'll stick with COD World at War, Warhawk, etc."
3,"Solid Shooter, little quirks","This is a good solid shooter, with a decent story campaign. Sadly the single player campaign is only about 6-7 hours long for most people, and this just never justifies more than a $20 price for me.The controls are alright, I would suggest remapping some of the buttons to match that of other mainstream shooters, like tap for scope which I turned to hold. The speed of the x/y axis take a few minutes to get used to but don't let it turn you off.Over all its great fun, even if it is a little short."
5,One of the best games for the PS3,"Killzone 2 is a great game and is one of the best out there for the PS3. The game looks spectacular and gameplay is top notch.The story, though limited, is decent and isn't too over the top like some other games out there. They could of made the intro to the game longer to give more of a history of what happened to help ease the player into the game.Overall, Killzone 2 is a wonderful game that offers an amazingly atmospheric experience and offer both a fun SP and MP gameplay."
5,Boyfriend LOVES it,I bought this for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. Has already beat it and traded it in..just waitin for the 3rd one! I also LOVED watching him play this game.
3,Not what I was expecting....,"I got dissapointed when I saw they took the offline multiplayer, which is one of the reasons I used to play this game a lot."
5,an exciting war game,"this game is really a kill zone, it is fantastic, the helghans are truly tough and smart warriors."
4,Good Shooter,"K2 is a good shooter that is engaging and fun to play. It really plows no new ground in terms of the FPS genre, but does do it with great graphics, a good storyline and steady action. My complaints are limited to some loading issues with the software. I was using a rented copy and the graphics would slow down or very briefly freeze up when loading. This happened quite frequently. Also, I found the aiming of weaponry to be a bit cumbersome, and not as smooth as some shooters. Further, I was a little disappointed that there was not more variety in the weapons. Would be nice to have a few more creative weapons to use, as that adds another dimension to the FPS genre.All in all though, a really good game and well worth playing."
3,"Generic singleplayer, fun multiplayer","The singleplayer experience is easily forgettable, reducing to your run of the mill, generic FPS. However, the multiplayer is extremely robust and will satisfy those looking for their next big online PS3 game.Be sure to buy yourself a bluetooth headset."
3,Meh,"what's to say... it's alright. the story is uninteresting, the shooting is decent, and the controls are alright.. but damn does it look good! yeah, the game is very good looking. but that's about it. everything else about this game is completely mediocre. not much else to say."
4,wow,"i know i was late to get this but wow is all i have to say , if you dont have buy this instance."
2,Not that great,Hmmm the graphics are cool. but i hate playing a DRUNKIN bum. This dude is drunk. i can aim better than this guy and he is in the military???LMAOthis is the main reason this will not get 5 stars. !!!! and if this game is the best you ever played ... LMAO that is to funny...get out more because there are so many better games
3,Forgettable,"I'm slightly surprised to see so many 5-star reviews for this one. I really don't understand why, with games like Modern Warfare, etc.. out there, people would rave about Killzone 2. This is a very generic shooter that follows a typically linear path that guides you to the next location. They make everything so obvious as to the objectives, like ""shoot out that bridge"", I mean come on. I found several of the guns to be useless and the head bobbing constantly as you move around makes you sick. Overall I think 3-stars perfectly sums this up. After you play for a few hours, you sit there and think....eh kind of boring. There's no wow factor at all other than graphics, but in this day and age graphics are the easy part...give me the game play!!"
4,good game but flawed,does any of these game developers wonder why call of duty 4 and 5 is so popular?and always holds number 1 on multiplayer?because the realism and pinpoint accuracy of shooting a weapon.killzone 2 is eye candy and an amazing campaign.but the shooting i didnt like. accuracy is aweful the guns shake like your having a seizure when your shooting.makes it extremely difficult to kill enemies.the multiplayer reminded me of resistance 2 so i didnt like it.the call of duty series with multiplayer is real and not complicated you have perfect accuracy and you know where your enemies are are at all times.but i dont want to ruin killzone 2 for everybody it is overall awesome.but the shooting thing just really turned me off.
1,All the hype fell extremely short,"When I first heard about Killzone 2 I was hesitant to get it but after talking to some people whom played the game I finally gave in and got a copy. After 6 days and about 10 hrs of game play, I reached the end of the game. I paused the game, put my controller down and yelled ""Done"" while tossing my arms in the air.Little did I realize that all the hype was for the multiplayer. That wasn't enough to make me hold on to the game. If I wanted to play a game with morons, I'd call friends over and say ""Hey, just go crazy. Run around, shoot wildly or hide for most of the time.""The only really good thing about the games were the graphics and weapons. The controllers were a mess also. Seriously, how could this game have gotten such high ratings? By far one of the most disappointing games for me since Street Fighter IV.My roots are old school. I could care less about multiplayer. Give me a deep campaign and a co-op option and I'm happy."
1,Are you kidding me? Felt like I was playing PS2's Black,"I went to various PS3 sites and this was in many as a top 10 PS3 game. Why? This game totally sucks. A complete rip-off/copy of PS2's Black, just not as fun, entertaining or original. Let me describe. In Killzone 2 you play a soldier that runs down corridors and bad guys with red eyes shoot at you. Then you shoot them and they die. So then you go down another long corridor (or up a ladder) and at the end of the corridor (or ladder) there is, surprise, more bad guys with red eyes shooting at you. So you throw a couple hand grenades and kill them or shoot them. Then they die, or red splatters fill the screen and my soldier dies. Then I shoot crates and get more grenades. *Sigh*. This game is unoriginal, monotonous, tedious.....total garbage, and I question why people and PS3 sites recommend it."
1,The game don't work....,"When i put the game in the console the intro video was fine, but at the end of the vidio the game stop and don't run, i try some times but allways have the same result, my PS3 es new ant all my other games work fine, i try to return the item but the page don't letme select the reazon to return and don't work... any way"
3,Good but not innovative.,"At first glance its graphics will simply blow you away. Unfortunately the looks are the only truly sensational thing about this game. The level design and AI are mediocre, particularly when it comes to your AI companions who frequently wander directly into lines of fire or nonchalantly walk directly towards enemies who are shooting at them. AI difficulty seems to go from mind-numbingly easy to frustratingly unfair, with no middle ground to speak of.Overall it is a solid and engaging game, but anyone who was hoping for the Uber-Shooter will be disappointed by the lackluster boss fights and the mediocre weapon and enemy variety. The game's online modes are enjoyable but limited, and a complete lack of a co-op mode may severely limit this game's replayability."
3,"Not even close to COD4, Gears and Halo.","Got the game and what's up with the crappy crontrols?? I had to sell this game due to they awfull controls while aiming. I guess I'm spoiled by recent the great shooters..ie Gears 2, Left 4 Dead, COD WAW. The online play is also a low point. Graphics are great. Controls are just all over the place. Rent it."
5,"Campaign is good, but Multiplayer is the best","I'm about halfway through the campaign for this game, and i have to say, i love it. it's a ton of fun, and it's highly enjoyable. but the multiplayer is the best i've played since halo 3 and call of duty 4. If you have a ps3, do anything you can to get your hands on 60 bucks for this game. it's that good."
3,"Good game, but controls cause it to suffer","GREAT GRAPHICS. This game looks amazing. It's fun to play. Challenging.However, the controls take away from the enjoyment of the game. It's difficult to aim accurately. I think they did this to make the game seem more realistic...but it hampered my enjoyment of what would have been a 5-star game that I played over and over. Instead, I sold it on ebay before I even finished it. Such a shame, as it was a world that was so much fun to play in. But I could not get over how frustrating the controls were, no matter how much I tried to adjust them. I'd play this game, then go back to COD and fell much more at home. I hope they address this issue in the next installment.Others didn't have as much to complain about in regards to the controls, but if you are a casual gamer like me, rent it first."
5,shooter games,this game is alot of fun for me as i am a below average gamer. it is definately more challenging for people with my skill level but very fun none the less. the variety of weapons and sheer number of adversaries combine to make it one of my favorite games. i have spent alot of time moving up through the levels and wonder if i will ever make it to the elite level. buy this game. you will love it.
3,Mediocre FPS,"I have to admit, after seeing the awards and hearing the raves about this game I was expecting something better than just a mediocre first person shooter.I purchased this as a greatest hits so I only paid $27 which is a fair price. This game will occupy you for a few hours but if you've been spoiled by the likes of Bad Company 2, COD Modern Warfare 2 or even MAG, this game will let you down."
3,Controls?,first review in amazon.com. I going to keep this short and sweet. The Dev definitely put alot of work into the visuals and thats it!.This game is not one of those FPS games where you can just get right into and have a blast. Its the controls! You do have to get used the controls but still it felt like you were being held back from the movement and aiming.All in all. Visuals are like candy to your eyes. controls killed the game and if they had co-op. this game would have been greater than it should have been.
5,Amazing,"So i preordered this game from amazon hoping this game would be as cool as everyone makes it out to be, man was I blown away,this game takes all the hype and runs with it throwing amazing graphics and moments that make you sit back and stare in mesmerized aw at your tv until your wife yells at you to stop drulling all over the place, and then you get to the multiplayer which is intense when you get all 32 players together in one little area, which the warzone gameplay seems to do quite nicly, it is chaotic i cant describe the feeling you get staring down the barrel of 16 guns pointed at you and your team mates it is pure insanity. so in closing if you like shooters and like chaotic intesity then deffinitly get this game"
5,Great FPS,"I played the first Killzone on the PS2 and considered that game was good, despite some flaws; Killzone 2 is so much better in terms of presentation and gameplay, that is on the same class as Modern Warfare from Infinity Ward. The single player campaign can take around 10 hours, depending on difficulty level, but from start to finish is really polished. Multiplayer is awesome, all the missions objectives such as destroy objective or kill an enemy target are great; the online maps are well designed and character class development keeps you playing more and more."
5,GREAT FPS!!!!!,"WWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!I can't believe it took me over a year to get this game, at the same time I got this one I got Killzone for the PS2, so right after i finished the first game I dove into this one, I know there is not much to say after all the great reviews, but here is what I think. The graphics are great, the story had me with out blinking, specially the end, the use of weapons feels very natural, the AI is no pushover, and gives you about 9 hours of fun, actually I intend to play an all night. My only complain is that in the box says it supports full 1080p HD, and it does not, it goes as far as 720, and I have seen this in a lot of games that claim to support full HD, I have de HDMI cable, the BRAVIA TV, so can anyone help me with this. Anyway, this game is awesome.PLAY ON!!!!!!"
2,Not nearly as good as Halo,"Overall disappointed. You can only carry a couple of weapons, and it's really hard to distinguish between friend and foe."
2,Meh..,"This game is over hyped to the MAX. Controls were terrible, weapons were inaccurate and lack luster, graphics were nothing to talk about.. If you are looking for a game that makes you angry, confused about random pauses, enemies coming from places they should not then this is your game.. Otherwise read the story for this one or whatever you need to do to get what happens and pick up killzone 3. If you need to try this please do not spend more than $10 on it lol... Beware!"
3,Midget POV sucks!,"1.You are basically a midget in this game or You have your eyes on the belly. You see everyone as you are looking above to them, while being looked down. Accustomed to other normal FPS games, this was a fun killer.2. The turning speed is not fast and natural(again unlike other normal FPS), You are slowed down by the software. So while you turn and try to shoot, you are already dead.3.Also while turning around, the picture is slightly shaken and blurred to give that ""realistic effect"". I hates this as it causes me irritation. I dont want to feel like a retarded, slow and epileptic midget hero.4.The environment is so very dark, there is almost no other color except dark, grey, black, brown and the red eyes. It makes me very unexcited to play it again."
1,"Cant believe how overrated htis game, especally gamespot's","omg,I wish I can return this stupid game,just waist of money,I would totally throw a big party for my friends if I got my money back,at least I will have fun partying,this game sucks,when I bought it, I thought I will see a new thing, or something fun online, but its just a letdownDont even think about buying this game,dont dareif u wanna trade, I would totally accept trading it with resident evill 5"
3,Great Graphic - Not so good game play....,"The game has great graphics, up there with all the other great FPS (COD, Resistance2, etc), but the controls on the game kind of suck.... Worst of all you can't create your own button mapping on the control, you can only use the available preset control settings the game comes with. The movement from first person is a little funny too, the X Y axis, fast than slow? If these small bugs where worked out it would be a much funner game. For these reasons I would rate this game as good not great."
4,Hard!,The game is fun to play because the enemy AI is pretty advanced - it took me no less than 3 hours to beat the final battle...
4,Game clitch,"Game glitch sometime through out the game. Graphic is great, sounds is top notch. Online is phenomenon. My only complaint beside the glitching issue, is the controller. Where the key and mouse usage for the ps3. I bought a similar device mouse and key, while it is not the same movement as the original dsk mouse and key. Otherwise the game is legit. Still working on the game and it has been 5 months since I bought the game. My advice take your time and appreciate the artiste of the game."
5,Killzone 2,"Killzone 2 game, I bought as a Christmas present. Kids were thrilled, just the game they always wanted to play"
1,Don't believe the hype,"With all of the positive reviews and awards this game was given, I was expecting something along the line of MOH or a CODMW game. Killzone 2, while it may be a vast improvement on its predecessor (wouldn't know, didn't play it), is a substandard gaming experience. Controls are counterintuitive, graphics are clunky, levels are simply not entertaining. Don't believe the hype."
2,Frustrating & not recommended.,"The 1st game was OK, so I figured I would give this one a try. I should have saved my time & money because this game was more frustrating than fun, full of glitches & the game play is not that great. I tried Killzone 1 & 2, but after two tries., I am done with this series."
3,(sigh)...................,"I played it over the weekend and... I'm done with the single player! I like games like Resistance tFoM because it lasted just a little bit longer than one stinking weekend!!!But for what its worth, it was a decent weekend. Not quite a $60PLUS one, but a decent weekend.Rent it for a week and see for yourself."
2,"OK Game, not great in anyway","This game is ok, great graphics. Don't need aim assist so no problem there but what suck big time is the split second hesitation/freezing during gameplay and/or when the game is loading. For a great system like the PS3, you'd expect smooth gameplay and transition, not he herky jerky system loading. What a waste, would have been a 5 but gave it a 2."
2,The Controls Are Just Plain Terrible,"I wanted to like this game. It's Call of Duty IN SPACE, something I've been waiting for. Instead, I spent a few hours flailing around like a drunken cow, wrestling with the controls just to draw a bead on a stationary enemy before deciding ""Screw this!"" and mailing it back to Gamefly. Yes, I did adjust the X-Y sensitivity. That doesn't change the inherent problem that you can't hold a gun steady to save your life - ""I want to point the gun here, but it goes over there! Realism!"" I've fired guns before so let me tell ya that ain't realism. It's lazy programming."
1,Nooo.....,"HUGE disappointment. Hearing the massive hype, I fell for this games ruse and bought it... Average graphics, slow framerate and terrible story, without anything interesting gameplay-wise to make up for it. Most certainly a flop. Don't waste your time."
3,Good but not Amazing,"Halo2- Best matchmaking system to this dayCOD4- pulled people in and to this day still has people playing itBF2- Fun, but lacking weapons and glitchyKillzone2- This is the only FPS that i have played on the ps3 console. First off I really dont like how the ps3 controller feels while playing this. It doesnt feel comfortable ,but thats not the games fault. The game is a mix off BF and i guess COD, U can basically always see where enemy players are because of the glowing face masks. Its also like BF in the way its dedicated/ player hosted servers. I have played one 40 min mutiplayer game and no campaign yet ,but I like most fps fans dont really care about the campaign just the online play. Its def. fun but I dont see it being a reason to buy the console. If you already have a ps3 and are looking for a good shooter (sick of CODwaw, BFBC) then this is for you. But with infinitys new cod and redfaction comming out later this year. We will see how this stands up to them."
1,Buy COD4 instead,"This game has been hailed as ""graphically awesome"" and ""looks amazing"" but the problem is that the game controls SUCK!!! Fanboys will cry, ""but it's so lifelike!"" You know what's really lifelike? The Army. That's why I joined. I play games to get away from real life. This game is collecting dust while I play COD4. Damn I want my money back!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"This Game is unbelievably terrible! Terrible controls, multiplayer is nothing but a constant grenade throw fest. Everyone keeps citing this game as so ""Tactical"" ... they are out of their minds. Look, either play Call of Duty 4 or Call of Duty Modern Warfare, (way more ""tactical"" in my opinion) or buy Team Fortress 2 ( which this game totally rips off in every way and fails miserably)!Wish I had not wasted my money on a game that offers NOTHING NEW in the FPS genre other than being a less steroid crappier version of Gears of War.YOU'Ve BEEN WARNED. (if you do buy this game, never use the Engineer class, utter joke)"
1,THE CONTROLS MAKE THIS GAME DREADFULL!!!,I AM AN AVID FAN OF FPS GAMES AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT KILLZONE 2 HAS THE BEST GRAPHICS THE PS3 HAS SEEN YET BUT THE WORST CONTROLS AND THE MOST GENERIC GAMEPLAY AS WELL. THE CONTROLS ARE SLUGGISH AND SLOW AND ARE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND ARE BY FAR SOME OF THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN ON ANY CONSOLE. THE ENVIRONMENTS ARE NOTHING NEW AND DON'T CHANGE MUCH THROUGHOUT THE GAME. I WOULD GET FEAR 2 OVER THIS ONE IT IS BETTER IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE *EXCEPT THE GRAPHICS*. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS LIKE I DID.
5,BEST FPS EVER!,"Outstanding visuals and realistic game play. The first level looks great but the game just keeps getting better. The stellar reviews are accurate, so buy the game."
4,better than killzone 3,ive rented killzone 3 one weekend..and sure its a great game..and it shows off the playstation 3 its just a rehash of killzone 2....Kz 2 is still a great game..even if its just a few years old...for some reason the game play is much smoother.. you can tell they took their time with this one. bottom line both are good games...but if you want to go with solid gameplay and a better online experience ...killzone 2 is the one to get...
4,Killzone = a Call of duty style game in a starship troupers universe!,"Good game, great graphics and very playable after you get past the movement restrictions caused by ""your space suit"".Worth a play through for sure until COD MWF 2."
5,Great Game,"The slow moving characters take a bit of getting used to. Someone once said that it is because the guys are loaded up, but what they didn't think about is that if you are trained right, your equipment becomes 2nd nature, and if you have been in battle as long as these guys are supposed to have been you should probably be pretty strong and not likely to notice you are carrying equipment around."
3,"Great Graphics but just an ""ok"" game.","I loved the first Killzone for Playstation 2. I figured that the next one would be a definite contender for one of the PS3's best games! I was pretty dissapointed when I got it. The Graphics are the best ever! Only computer games and probably Metal Gear Solid can compare. The gameplay was just very mediocre. The controls were very funny as well. They were sort-of non-resposive. If you love First Person Shooters or the Killzone Series then this may be for you. As for me, I found that the game was way too focused on graphics and left some of the essential game mechanincs behind."
3,What kinda gamer are you?,"I enjoyed the gameplay though you could tell they borrowed from Gears or War and the consumer expectation of taking physical cover. The execution of this was somewhat annoying (holding down L2 to remain in cover). The scenes were dark with respect to lighting which is to be expected, but made the game less enjoyable because I didn't know what I was looking at sometimes (I checked settings and played on a 46"" Samsung). Graphically the game is very rich in textures and rendering.The campaign was short and the story-line seemed to be rushed, especially the ending, which was very disappointing. Apparently the online play is great, but I can't really review it since I've only gone on three times.If you're buying the game to enjoy by yourself, it'll be shortlived. If you're buying it for the combo-campaign/online, then you'll be satisfied"
4,Excellent game,"I highly recommend this game for those players that like an extreme action first shooter games. Kill Zone 2 has minor improvement compared to other recent first shooter games like Call of Duty World at War. The sound is brutal, especially if you have a good home teather system. Likewise, the graphics are very good but not much like Metal Gear Solid 4, although it has a lot details, especially if shoot walls and granande explosion (everything blow away). The story is not bad (campaign mode), but some time is frustating after a hard campaign (more than 10 minutes killing everyone) since the videos are not fun to getting you excited like other war games. Besides, you can not play like Rambo since the enemies cover very well their bodies behing solid objects like walls, barrels, so they can hit you very easy if do not cover your butt too."
3,definitely not worth full price,"If possible I would give this game 2 1/2 stars. I had high expectations for Killzone 2 but was really disappointed. Worst of all I paid full price when it's worth half that at most. There was little variety in the campaign and overall it was quite boring. I had fun driving the mech and the tank but those parts are short-lived. Adding to my boredom was the lack or variety in weapons, enemies, and scenery. My final bit of frustration was that the ending of the game is ridiculously hard. In fact, neither me or my wife could finish it. I suppose we could have completed it eventually but we were so sick of the game that we gave up and traded it in. I didn't try the online play but the campaign has little if any replay value. It does have outstanding graphics and tight play but those few things don't make it worth $55. I would rent it or get it very cheap."
4,Pushing the Bar,"The graphics are simply amazing in this game. The big headaches, are not the best choices for control lay outs, and the environment seems pretty repetitious. If you own a ps3 this is a must have exclusive though. For the current price, it's a value. You'll want to know the story line for the next improved kill zone 3 as well."
5,I love it.... the payback time.,"I just want to say that I really like this game, it is old considering the release date and when I got it... just months ago.But I enjoy it, overall.Thanks"
5,Goldeneye II,"Finally, a game which comes along that challenges you in ways other games don't. What sets this game apart from the rest is the enemy movements. The enemy hides, reacts and responds in ways that require you to use all weapons at your disposal (i.e. throwing/rolling grenades to flush them out in the open, then gunning them down). They also talk smack against you during battle and curse words are dropped like every 3 minutes. People complain about the controls, but I find them easy, especially after you've played the game solo (ala Goldeneye). The online is awesome and getting better...32 players, 2 teams, various options. Metal Gear was great for the Playstation, but I think KZ2 tops it as best game I've played thus far. Only negative is no local multiplayer, but this is the game to buy the PS3 for. Tell your bro's to get their own."
3,Quite disappointing,I'd like to rate this 2-1/2 stars. I saw it at the IMax theatre at the Kennedy Space Center. I was quite disappointed. Only a small portion of the film was in IMax - the part that was to give you a feel for what it is like to walk on the Moon. The majority of it was just standard stuff.
1,"For kids only, looks like a low budget film","I had high hopes for this movie when I purchased it. Sadly if fell flat on its face. For all but younger kids (8 or younger) this film is amatuerish and has poor special effects. Of course,I was hoping for more high quality footage from the Apollo program - so my expectations may have been too high. In addition, the musical score overwhelmed Tom Hank's narrative. All in all, not worth the money."
2,Magnificent Desolation - Walking on the Moon (IMAX),"No real ""new"" footage more of a kids movie. Not bad for the price. It has some amazing photos, but a lot of the moon landing footage is reenacted. Personally I wouldn't bother with this one. There are much better movies on this subject. Maybe it needs to be viewed at IMAX to get the full benefit."
3,what if? (rhetorical question about Tom Hanks),"What would happen if Tom Hanks refused to do another NASA film? Would he mysteriously disappear, or maybe die in a mysterious car accident?At this point in his career and life, I think it is safe to assume that Tom Hanks is REQUIRED to help NASA perpetuate the Moon landing hoax. There is really no other explanation for why Tom Hanks continues to be involved in making movies about the moon landing hoax year in and year out. He can't possibly believe that men have walked on the Moon.I would imagine that there is blackmail involved. ""NASA"" probably has compromising photos of Tom Hanks.Anyway, I haven't seen this film, but I doubt if it's any good.Since I haven't seen the film, I feel that a three star rating is fair, and probably better than it deserves."
5,Stunning!,"I saw Tom Hanks's, ""Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D"" at the IMAX theater at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia twice. It was stunning from beginning to end. Outer Space has always been my first love and when the film showed 3D shots of the lunar surface and what a future lunar base would look like, I got emotional to the point that tears were in my eyes. It is a must have for everyone's home movie collection and especially if you are a space buff like me. It will be in my collection, count on it!!!!"
2,Kiddies film only,"I had high expectations for this film, but they weren't really met. The special effects are good, but it is interspersed by a mainly NASA recruiting film for kids. It has dumbed down the moon landings to a 8 year olds level. Ok it may be great for kids and I guess that is the intended audience, but I am sick of the modern way of dumbing everything down so it is boring. There is nothing to inspire me, no romance for returning to the moon, no excitement or adventure, even though they did try on this. The series ""From the Earth to the Moon"" got it right, why did Tom Hanks let us down with this one which could have been the best ever? The IMAX films ""The Dream is Alive"" and ""Hail Columbia"" got it right why did this one miss the boat I wonder?Go see it at an IMAX theatre, but don't bother with the DVD if you are a real space fan. Also the extra material is of such low res graphics it could have been shot with a cell phone camera. It froze up my DVD player and I had to reboot it."
2,CGI Promo Film,"Disappointing. I had hoped for actual photos and images from the Apollo missions, but found mostly computer generated images. The best real stuff, and the majority of it, is in the end credits. The bonus material is anemic. If you are looking for something to get pre-teens excited about going back to the moon, show them this. If you are someone that grew up in the early days of space travel, as I did, don't waste you time or money."
1,Not at all what we expected.,"Bought this for my husband, he had heard about it years ago in IMAX but never got to go see it. We were both pretty excited to see it but that changed after 10 min into the movie.. Most of it isn't any new footage, a lot of children were interviewed throughout the ENTIRE movie, asking them questions about what it means to them to be an astronaut, or what they think it's like on the moon, etc.. It wasn't at all what we expected. Not worth the money, buy something else.."
2,"Superficial, but maybe suitable for very young kids","I'm inclined to like anything that has to do with the space program, but I was very disappointed by this film. Technically it's well done, but it's basically just vapid propaganda that generates no sense of wonder or excitement, despite an attempt to pump up some synthetic suspense with a ""what if something had gone wrong?"" sequence. Maybe an eight-year-old would find this bit of fluff inspiring, but for anybody else, I recommend the truly superb ""In the Shadow of the Moon,"" or the equally good ""Apollo 13,"" or the ""From the Earth to the Moon"" HBO series."
2,Lightweight,"I wouldn't even show this to kids. It's obvious that a lot of work went into it, but the results are insipid.Watch ""In the shadow of the moon"" instead."
3,"15 years later ,the revised book is still under researched","After all this time you'd have thought someone would have informed Mr Bego that Billy Cunningham was a musical director more so than a piano player and that when he stopped playing for Ms Midler at the Baths he didn't exactly exit . Even after writing Cher If You Believe, he still doesn't know who Kenny (Claude )Sasha was and why the off Broadway run of French Dressing at the Village Gate (Top of the Gate) and Cher's Act had a lot more to do with the drag bar scene in ""The Rose"" than Bette' s wanting to be a legendary movie star. The sad part is by the time he revises the book again even more of sources he should have interviewed the first time around won't be with us."
5,Good quality,"I can't believe I got the quality at this price. It's the right size for casual trips. Wallet, card pouch, keys, cellphone... easily go in there. Love the zippers."
5,This book will draw you closer to Jesus,"Frank Rega's book on Padre Pio will take you into an intimate look with a soul united to God. Through his sufferings, Padre Pio became conformed to Christ, not only spiritually, but physically as well. His closeness to Christ was seen through his sufferings, which he united to God's own suffering, to help save souls from destruction. Padre Pio's love for soldiers gives me great consolation, since I have a son serving in Iraq. As a lay Franciscan, I pray to him daily to intercede for my family, and to portect, watch over, and guide my children to Jesus.. Thank you, Frank, for writing such a wonderful book!"
2,A SERIES OF STILL PHOTOGRAPHS AND SYNTHESIZER MUSIC.,"This is a review of Mysterious Aqua - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality [HD DVD]. This HD-DVD is a series of still photographs with water as the subject matter accompanied by synthesizer music. It is a project by Alexander Jero and last about 42 minutes. The pictures are nice but I did not find anything special about the sound, the title ""Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" creates expectations that are not meet or come near what was expected. If you like electronic music and can buy it at a CD price ($9.99), you might be happy with this recording, otherwise is not for you."
2,No mystery for this aqua experience,"Nice music, nothing extraordinary. Video is a slide show of photographs. Nice, but appear to be pictures within an aquarium. My opinion, not worth the price."
1,Hated it. Don't waste your money.,"Low res pictures set to something approximating music. Did not enhance my Home Theatre experience at all. If you want something that does that, get Planet Earth."
5,DESERT SON DVD - Cutting edge and gritty!,"DESERT SON: Is like taking ""Lord of the Flies,"" putting it on steroids, and then setting it out in the desert to bake! The young talented cast and crew radiates a powerful creative energy that is unadulterated. Desert Son is a gritty, action packed, thriller that spirals down to a exhilarates and surprising ending! Nathan Halliday won ""Best Supporting Actor"" (MethodFest Film Festival) for his chilling intense and dark role as Jack. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful and the locations are shot in authentic California desert Ghost Towns.Bottom line - This film exhilarates you like the feeling one has the very first time you learn to ride your bike after Dad takes off the training wheels! You feel yourself being pushed off, not sure how it will end, taking you to the very edge.... and then pushing you over it!Desert Son"
4,Good buy,"Midway Arcade Treasures 3 follows the same formula as the previous releases. You buy the collection for one, maybe two of the games. A couple seem interesting but actually suck because the PS2 controller just doesn't do them justice. You find out that one game is a lot more fun than you thought it would be and the one you bought the disc for is OK, but not totally freaking awesome like you hoped for.My 6 year-old son enjoys Offroad Thunder and Hydro Thunder, I'm a fan of SF Rush 2045 and the rest of the games are better left in the pits.Maybe someday someone will create a freewheeling controller for games like Off Road or Badlands."
2,Arcade made bad,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun to play classic arcade on the PS2, however, nothing changed. The games are just that, ugly retro downgraded pixel games. Its all the same as the arcade version, you play and you go....away.I like Hydro thunder in the arcade because of the awesome sound, vibration, graphics and feel. But here, the graphics have been totally downgraded, the music and sound FX are trash, and it's just not fun. The same goes for RUSH the rock and RUSH 2049, and won't even mention the other games. San Francisco rush is ten times better than its predecessor.All this developer did stay up for a few hours and throw together some racing games."
3,lots of fun,if you like racing games then this is the one for you..I don't play it much but my 2 boys enjoy it alot..say that they are fun to play.
5,Gotta love the classics,If you dont like the games on here you probably wont buy it. Its cheaper than buying the individual games for the original console.
3,Great Fun Ho Hum graphics,"The games in this collection are a great load of fun to play and will no doubt bring back memories for you old time gamers. The controll for all the games is great but where this collection lacks is in the graphics. The graphics seem a little muddy and jaggy, I know they were not cutting edge when they came out but Hydro Thunder and Off Road Thunder in particular looked much better on the Dreamcast and Xbox which used to be the direct competitor of the Playstation 2. If you haven't jumped on the PS3 or 360 bandwagon yet then pick this up for fun."
2,Good and very bad,"This book almost reads like something that was once great and then was ""improved"" to something less than it once was. I found that there are some very useful tips in the text which are supplemented by inaccurate examples. I have found examples which are not related to the surrounding text as well as examples which contradict the text. I like the overall plan of the book and, strangely, I have found parts of it very helpful. There was a distinct point, however, where I started to focus more on the errors than on the information, which became a serious distraction and lowered my review from four stars to three, and then eventually to two."
2,Lacks Examples,Who wants to read a purely theoretical book on scripting? This book is good but it just contains syntax. There are no good examples to plug into a machine to understand and feel like you are accomplishing something. Reading this book is similar to trying to learn english by reading a dictionary. Save your money.
3,"The book is a decent reference, but poor on examples.","Overall the book clarifies how to use the different commands. I felt it was lacking in programming examples to teach the concepts. The part for the ""novice"" at the beginning of the book is a fair review of basic Unix. If you don't understand Unix, then don't even attempt anything in this book.The concepts contained are invaluable for anyone wishing to learn to program. It has also come in handy for looking up a command with it's parameters."
1,Terrible Examples,"Clearly, the authors have not verified the examples they provided in the book. When I ran the example scripts, frequently I would encounter mistakes here and there. It is rather annoying to have such a stupid problem when you try to understand the presented concepts or convention."
2,I should have read the reviews.,"A helpful programming book can take one of two forms: a well structured reference or an insightful tutorial. This book is neither. The index lacks key entries, and the examples are taken from the man pages. I regret not getting other people's opinion on the book before I bought it."
1,Save a tree and don't buy this book.,"This book is filled with confusion. The authors do not appear to fully understand Unix shell programming. It is not a good reference or a good tutorial. If you buy this book, you are wasting money, time, and trees."
1,Don't even think about buying this book - You will regret!,"The authors of this book provide an unorganized method to mislead the experienced readers about what they already understood and confuse the novices the concept of UNIX. The book is written in non-techical writing, which makes it a ""special"" reference guide."
1,Save your money for the next one.,"This book lacks real-world examples of implementation. The authors give you little more than what you can obtain from the Unix man pages. In addition, the book contains several bad approaches to problem solutions. This text is for the advanced Unix programmer only. Unfortunately, the advanced Unix programmer will soon tire of the presentation style, which is definately not tutorial."
1,Just another vanilla Unix book,"Someday, someone will write a good book on Unix scripting. This isn't the one. This one lacks solid examples, and does a very poor job explaining how to implement Unix scripts in the REAL world. The authors appear to have rummaged through the Unix man pages for most of the book's content, but fail to give the reader anything more than what the man pages provide. The lack of solid examples in this book leaves the reader with the impression that the authors do not really understand the subject, and are simply regurgitating the Unix man pages. For the few examples that do exist, there are far easier ways to solve the same problems with many fewer commands."
3,The colossus of Japan.,"Mixing elements of the jedai(samurai)film with elements of the kaiju(monster)film, Daimajin is a rousing adventure that is sure to appeal to fans of both types of films. Set in medievel Japan, the film follows the story of a boy and his sister, who are pursued by the man who had their father murdered and then took over his kingdom. Watching all of this is the giant statue of Majin, a powerful spirit that can be invoked to right wrongs and punish evil-doers. The story moves along well, aided by good performances by all of the actors, though it is perhaps a bit slow at first. Once Daimajin(""dai"" meaning giant, ""majin"" meaning spirit) revives, all hell breaks loose on the evil Lord and his men. The spfx are spectacular(immensely aided by the widescreen presentation). Functioning like a pounding funeral drum is Akira Ifukube's magnificent score, one of his best non-Godzilla works. This is a great film that is thankfully no longer obscure."
4,Great Movie,This movie is aweswome. Daimajin destroying the nation is a pretty cool scene. But personally WRATH OF DAIMAJIN is better
3,"Not the realistic ""flow"" I was looking for.","I bought this plant with two other 36 in. varieties, the asparagus fern and the bamboo plant, and this is my, as well as the fishes, least favorite of the three. It's easy to tell it is fake, you can see all the connections, and it just doesn't seem to ""flow"" very well. On the other hand, it does a good job of blocking fast flowing water from a filter, power head or such. It floats well, as well as any other plastic plant will. It does provide good shade from the overhead light, and decent protection for small fish. My Jack Dempsey fry still prefer the asparagus fern the most for cover."
2,"Disappointed in Quality, Function and Purchase","Lid arrived scratched with a piece broken off in the box making the product not usable. Tray is not snug, and the bottom of the unit has holes, so if you attempt to use the handles, the water will flow everywhere. Not a good option to keep dwarf frogs safe and happy. I will now need to go through the time and hassle to return the item and wait for a refund. Purchasing this item was a mistake."
1,There are NO SUCH THING AS small turtles,"I only gave it one star because there is not an option of less than one! These containers are not recommended for any type of water turtle. Do your research before you buy. I am the first to encourage people to keep turtles as pets, but know what you are getting into. Game and Fish laws state turtles are supposed to be four inches or greater. Many pet stores sell them MUCH smaller and sell containers like these with them. It really is cruel and not recommended by any responsible turtle website."
1,Plastic bowl of death,"This product and similar ""turtle islands"" are little plastic bowls of death. It is way too small has no filtration. Even small turtle species will outgrow this in less than a year. Also unsuitable for amphibians."
4,I Can't Explain It,"This movie has it all. Indifferent direction, cheesy script, lackluster locations, undistinguished acting, but...I had a great time watching it and I don't know why (and I don't care to try to explain why). This was the male version of my wife's idiotic rom-coms--she knows they're trash but loves them anyway. Well, I knew this movie was crapola but I couldn't bring myself to turn it off: a most unusual and inexplicable phenomenon."
4,Guilty pleasure!,"This is by no means a 4-star movie, but for whatever the reason I just like it! I don't know if it's the character acting, the over the top violence, the predictable story... whatever it is I'll put this on every few months and just enjoy it."
2,Disappointing read bordering on tedious,"This book might always have come across as a disjointed read (as it delves into four separate areas of mathematics) but it also suffers because these areas fail to hold the reader's attention. The four sections covered are number theory, shapes and topology, computer science, and the mathematics of voting.Of the four, the number theory section is the most interesting, but a more in-depth and charming analysis of this area of mathematics can be found in Simon Singh's two books: Fermat's Last Theorem and The Code Book.The chapter on computing machines is weakened by the fact that the book was published first in 1989 and consequently is rather dated.Overall I would describe this book as a page-turner but only in the sense that I skipped pages to swiftly conclude certain chapters."
5,Discovering,"WOW!!! One of those books that you don't want to put down. How typical of the 20's, 30's, 40's, not todiscuss ""family secrets"". And I suppose even today for some people. But Carter tells a story of love, disappointment, hurt, curiosity, understanding, regret and peace. . How interesting to hear about the banking industry and how some people just wanted to survive. How interesting to hear about the development of some WV cities.I love Carter's style of writing and hope she plans to write another book."
5,Bestseller / Movie potential,"Father's Troubles remains with me weeks after having read it and is becoming a treasured book memory. Like others, once started, I couldn't stop reading. The pre-Depression rise and fall of the author's financier grandfather and his family is a modern tragedy extending to the present generation, largely because of the remarkable code of silence adopted by his children. The author deftly crafts ""then and now"" and her research experience, which takes her to many West Virginia archives including those of the old Moundsville Penetentiary. Her reward is the appreciation she gains for her family's women underlined by the epiphany she experiences re her relationship with her mother. Could current players (Enron, etc.) be depicted arousing such pathos?!"
4,Too much ambition can be dangerous...,"This book, part fiction, part non-fiction, is an interesting read. Because I live in the Huntington, WV, area, I was interested in the history of the region. Although the story took place long before my time, the author mentioned places that I recognize. The narrator is writing in the present day about the past. This is a frame story (story within a story), and Carter does a great job with both. The narrator is researching her ancestor's story and discovers that because he was so ambitious, his life did not have the best ending. (I'll leave that to the reader.)I would encourage history buffs to discover this book...it is a great way to become reacquainted with the time period, before, during, and after The Depression."
5,Father's Troubles.... A Remarkable Journey,"A hushed family secret is skillfully and lovingly untangled by the granddaughter, revealing the strength and courage of theremarkable women who led them all towards grace and forgiveness."
4,If you've been buulied at work read this,Except for only touching on the personalities of victims this book is excellent. The details of bullying in the workplace described almost exactly what happened to me at work. It also opened my eyes as to why it was sooo difficult to look for another job. I felt relieved after reading it; knowing I am not alone.
5,Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace,"This book is absolutely enlightening. It discusses emotional abuse that is becoming prevalent at workplace. The emotional abuse is invisible. The book elaborates the tactics of mobbers as well as their characteristics. Mobbing is expensive for the employer. The book offers suggestions on how to handle mobbing. The authors point out that research indicates that those employees who are high achievers; are dedicated to their job; and are least aggressive become targets. Because of their outstanding attributes, their co-workers who are extremely aggressive feel threatened and resort to mobbing with the intent of forcing them out. If you have been a target, this book will help you preserve your sanity. Order this book right now!!"
5,very good book,"Excellent book about a phenomenon that is too little discussed and is poorly understood in the American workplace. ""Mobbing"" is not ""bullying,"" but shares some similarities. Mobbing is more subtle and the person chosen as the target doesn't always know how to respond. This is partly because mobbing is too subtle and is practiced by those with varying levels of power within the workplace -- including the upper echelon of management, co-workers on the same level of power/responsibility as the mobbed person, and workers who might be subordinate to the person affected but who are nevertheless favored in some way by the empowered (for example, a clerical person who is a favorite of a supervisor and receives no negative feedback no matter how poor their job performance may actually be.)Great book!"
2,Anacdotal,"Interesting read, but not as informative as I'd hoped. Mostly consists of short definitions followed by several sentences describing someone's story, over and over again in chapter after chapter. Borrow this from the library rather than buying it."
5,Mobbing Book Review,"In the midst of turmoil at work I happened across the Mobbing USA http://www.mobbing-usa.com/ website which has helped me immensely; there are so many people in the United States who are in the same shoes as mine and although that is sad, it tells me that what I'm experiencing is real for people like myself who are being mobbed; I'm looking forward to when all of the USA incorporates mobbing laws to support people like myself from going through this nightmare."
5,A Must-Read for Anyone Experiencing Workplace Abuse,"This book clearly explained exactly what was happening to me at work, and why. It explains why abusers act the way they do, and how targets tend to be certain types of people ... good people, I might add.I felt as though I could have written the book myself, it so clearly described what I was experiencing at work. It helped explain why coworkers were abandoning me, among other insightful observations.The best part about reading this book, for me, was that I now realized that I was not alone in this dilemna; that the problem WASN'T me; and that I was employed by a very dysfunctional firm. Knowledge is power, and this book is both knowledgable and powerful."
4,Young Brothers Massacre,"One of the better books I have read about deadly force incidents. It actually included photographs and, more importantly, diagrams of what occurred. Few authors bother with any diagrams and spend almost all their effort on background of the participants; as a result, readers of most such books know plenty about the actors but little about the actual event.This author took the time to describe the events in detail and included the court testimony and diagrammed the incident. A much better account of this event is the result. I wish more books about unfortunate incidents took this author's approach."
5,An excellent historical account of one of our nation's most startling and tragic losses of law enforcement officers (pre-911),"Author Bruce Davis gives an insightful and thorough examination of the Young family and all of the law enforcement officers, families and events which led up to the dreadful event on January 2, 1932, and culminating with the capture of the brothers who committed this atrocity. You won't want to put this one down!"
1,Where is it?,Here is another item they want me to review and have not recieved. These must be computer generated on a timeline.
1,Don't Bother!,Lame vanilla sex sandwiched between inexoribly long and idiotic dialog. Do the men even have penises? I sure didn't see any!
2,Lame,"No idea why I bothered buying this video. There's one scene that is pretty sexy, but otherwise, it's pretty uninspiring. ;)"
2,Z,"I'm not sure what everyone else watched, maybe I was expecting to much after reading these other reviews, but I was more than just a little disappointed. The women are attractive that is for sure, but that's the only thing this movie has going for it. The sex footage was over before is started. At the most they lasted about 30 seconds. I'm not looking for hard-core porn, but this was far from what I was looking for. My suggestion is 'buyer-be-aware'."
2,Nothing to write home about,"I am off to Cancun in 2 months. Never been there, so I wanted to ""check things out"" in advance. I bought this and Frommers Guide. I was not impressed by either one. Fodor's was especially short on info in my opinion. The Cancun section was rather small overall. I have found better information just surfing the internet. They give you some very basic descriptions and price guides, but no recommendations. I have never been there... that is what I need! Which tour is best, which ruins should I see, etc, etc. I got NONE of that! Frommers was a little better in that they gave you more diverse information, but no real recommendations. I will see if I can find something better than both of these before my trip. If you must choose between these two popular travel guides, go with Frommers."
2,Not much help for me,I didn't find this book much help in finding either an agent or a publisher. Too much is done on the internet today. Hard copy like this becomes outdated before it's on the shelf. Too much change is now taking place in the publishing world.
2,Odd platform for religion-bashing,"If you are distracted or dismayed when an ostensibly unrelated article is used as a platform for spouting atheism or criticizing religious beliefs, then you should steer clear of this book. Hopefully, the next edition will achieve a higher level of professionalism."
4,Not too bad,"It wasn't until I got home and opened it that I caught the ""NEW stereo recordings"" part of the packaging, so I was a bit skeptical.However, after giving it a listen, I'm not at all disappointed. I happened to have just seen CDB in concert in Vegas and despite his age, he still puts on a great, energetic show. And to me, this CD reflects that - it's got a new, different energy that the original recordings lack (perhaps due to their age). It's got the energy of that live show, without the sort of annoying ""live"" sound of a live CD."
1,Meh,Does not come with power adapter and the wire is shoddy. I works but you would be better off looking elsewhere for a USB hub.
1,Save your money ..... Don't Buy This Junk!,"I bought this unit with the name ""XTRASTOR"" on the cover. It is the exact same unit and it doesn't read any of my CF, xD, or SD cards.Save your money and steer away from this piece of junk."
1,garbage pure and simple,"Do not buy this item. I bought it so I could transfer files from my digital camera directly to my laptop without using the data cable that came with the camera. It only seemed to work when it wanted to. When I first saw it online for sale, I thought to myself this looks great since it also had a 3 port usb 2.0 hub which would come in handy since my laptop only has one usb port. FORGET IT! This item is crudely made and there is no quality whatsoever to be found. A friend of mine who is a computer expert couldn't even get this piece of crap to work so I threw it away and just bought a new one.save your money"
5,Larry McMurtry Double Feature,"These are excellent videos detailing the before and after lives of the characters from Lonesome Dove. In the Streets of Laredo a very excellent story, I think Capt. Call played by James Garner was not his ""Cup of Tea."" He's a great actor but I think he has been miscast for this part, it's hard to top Tommy Lee Jones or Jon Vaught for the Woodrow F. Call charater. Don't let this little bit of negativism put you off from these two excellent Videos."
5,Alla Pugacheva Is The Queen Of Russian Pop Music,"Alla Pugacheva, heroine to millions of Russians and eastern Europeans but is a total unknown to most of the rest. Communism has come and gone, but Alla has remained. She has been likened to Barbra Streisand for her ballads. Her longevity and penchant for thigh-skimming skirts draw obvious comparisons to Tina Turner.Admittedly, it takes a Russian to truly appreciate her emotional ballads. But her songs, with lyrics by Russian poets, are far from banal. Undoubtedly, who just heard her songs would award her music a standing ovation or two!!!"
5,Goddess and Empress of Russia,"Pugacheva is the most ppopular and respected person in Russia.I fell in love with her voice and personality when I was a kid.I lived in Moscow and her popularily was at its peak.Now she is one of the most important person in Russian history.She sold almost 140 million albums.In this compilation,some of them are cheesy and old fashioned, but most of them are masterpieces.She mixed pop,rock,soul,chanson and jazz with gypsy styled russian folk.And her great voice!Poweful and earthy.I believe this cd is must item for every music fans."
3,Works ok but Little oversized,"Used for couple of weeks. Only thing that bothers me is its size, I need to spend some time adjusting it so that I can breathe freely since when I put it on it cover all the way from my eye brows to my nostrils. Other than that product functionality is fine."
3,Decent product and value...,O.K. product and a good value. I am not that crazy about the gel insert as it does not maintain temp for very long. It would probably work better if the mask was a little better insulated so that the warmth is only lost through one side.
3,"Good sleep mask, not so therapeutic","This mask is soft and comfortable, and effectively blocks out light. However, the ice-pack is very small. It doesn't cover eye-to-eye, more like inner-eye-to-inner-eye. So if you want a nicely chilled nose, this is the eye mask for you. I assume it has ""the power of magnets,"" but I can't see or feel them.Again, it's soft, comfortable, and effectively blocks light. It does have an ice pack, and if you shift things around, perhaps it might work for you. But it didn't for me."
1,"Wow, this kit sucks... really","I bought the Nifty Pro-line carpet kit in Black for my 1999 jeep Wrangler sport TJ. It came barely in a box, it looked like it was really poorly packaged. When opened it contained NO instructions or information at all. Upon further examination of the carpet, it looked SUPER CHEAP and of the poorest quality... I was a bit shocked... The so called welded seams were of the poorest quality as well.. It looked like the cheapest Chinese carpet ever... For almost 300 bucks, this carpet kit should not be bought by another sucker like me... Trust me...Also, the carpet is poorly cut, and the cut outs for the parking brake and the accelerator pedal were not pre cut out, it was just raw carpet. Not what I expected, a joke for almost 300 bucks.All in all if there was a lower rating, I would of used it... like a quarter of 1 star.... this kit is that bad... no kidding... beware... mine went back... I hate this product...BD"
1,Boring Cartoons-Tex Avery Fans Look Elsewhere!,"I'd seen Tex Avery's amazing, surreal, funny, sardonic swing-era cartoons and fell in love with them for life--which is why I got this collection. Unfortunately, there is nothing of that magic on this pathetic collection. apparently some cartoonists in the 60s bought the rights to Avery's name and produced a spiritless pastiche that carries on the master's mannerisms, but whose chief characteristic seems to be feeble attempts at humor that never come off. These cartoons are to Tex's own work what the insipid 1960s Felix the Cat cartoons are to the brilliant silent prototypes of the 1920s--mindless pablum. They're lacking the joy and the clever sparkle that pulse through Avery's own work, or through the incredible animation of his predecessors like Max Fleischer, Ub Iwerks, and Rudolf Ising. Save your money and your time, and get the real Tex Avery cartoons from the golden age."
4,Great Item,"I purchased this 12 volt flojet pump for my mountain cabin which is solar powered. As of this writing, I have not yet installed this pump, but I currently have an older style flojet pump and it works great, so I have no reservations about this new unit working just as well or even better since it has the pressurized tank and a higher gpm output. I also know of other people in my area that have this unit and they only have great things to say about it."
1,don't buy Perl/Tk book,"I'm a big fan of the O'Reilly Perl books. Most of them are very well written, and can really increase your knowledge about a topic. But this book is an exception. Simply put, it's horrible. Don't buy this book. It's poorly written, has a bad style, and provides nothing that you couldn't easily get from online documentation."
2,Lacks content,"Indy Cars of the 1950's is disappointing. Nice pictures, but the captions do not really capture the flavor of the period. Technical data is nil, consisting of two pages at the very front of the book. The book unabashedly is tilted towards the products of Frank Kurtis, but contains no anecdotal information, technical discussions, or the like to flesh out the author's admiration. You can read the entire book in a 15 minute sitting. Quite disappointing - Joe Scalzo's book Indianapolis Roadsters 1952-64 is much better resource for this period of Indianapolis 500 history."
4,Mondo-festive salute to the next thousand years,"Mondo-festive salute with a South American feel to the next thousand years that features Rhythmtown-Jive, The Christmas Jug Band (Dan Hicks, et al), many others from the Globe Roster, special guest vocalist Susie Davis (Prince, Pat Benatar, Sinead O'Connor) a rousing Dixieland finale, and lots of kids from the Wilson School (Petaluma, CA). The choruses are sung in English, but nine other languages speak translated versions throughout the piece (French, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Hawaiian, Greek, Spanish, Japanese, Cajun French, and German). A portion of proceeds benefit Stewart Brand's Long Now Foundation. This is a CD single AND a Globe Records Compilation. There are full-length and edited versions of ""Happy New Millenium"" as well as 9 cuts from recent Globe Records and Loball Releases."
4,Saint Francis Guide is great for residents,"I was pleasantly surprised by the Saint Francis Guide to Outpatient Medicine! The content was thorough enough for my clinic, and went beyond the basics of outpatient care. What I loved most about the book was the last section of each chapter which gave recommendations for follow up care, which, as a resident is probably the hardest thing for me to decide when seeing patients in my clinic. I have already shown this book to my fellow residents and even attendings as a book everyone should own. Thank you so much for this great reference!"
4,A must read for Saint Bernadette admirers.,The book was written in 1925 less than a 100 years after Bernadette went to the grotto. And it seemed pretty well documented. I really enjoyed reading about her visit to the grotto and the author suggests what the lady was telling her. After each chapter the author offers a prayer. It has pictures and drawings also. The timeline is from her birth to beatification. All around good overview of her life.
5,Fantastic!,"I really enjoyed this both this CD and the first one. This CD has a very different flow to it than the previous one (mainly due to the [Drama] parts of it). I would suggest this one more if you're a fan of the show, and go with the first one if you're newer to it. The reason that i gave this a five instead of a four, though, is that the music is superb. Mitsumune and the Pillows sound amazing on this disk. A definite buy for fans, and, if you like the genre, for others as well."
1,this misses the point,"This has a nice rahrah tone, but doesn't have the information or support suggestions I found in THE PAUSE by Dr. Lonnie BArbach -- a book I'm very glad my doctor recommended when I expressed my disappointment in this one. In THE PAUSE I found the kind of detail interpretation and facts which explained not just physical and emotional symptoms, but ways of handling them. It really helped me get going again and I recommend it instead."
3,Some good material.,"I think this book could be good for a lot of people. As I glanced through the topics, I didn't find that it was going to be a useful to me as I thought. I am going through perimenpause, but not necessarily experiencing all of the symptoms they talk about. Also, I didn't find some of the topics I was interested in that I think are symptoms of perimenopause that I'm experiencing."
5,The change before the change: Everything you need to know to stay healthy in the decade before menopause.,This book is very informative! I'm reading as much as I can about menopause right now and have definitely learned from the information in this book!
2,Disappointed,"Over all I was disappointed in this book. The action and suspense were not bad. And the Christian aspect was good. However, there were way too many unimportant details in the writing. The characters were empty and one-dimensional. Russell came across as a robot. Interaction between the characters was stilted and specifically attempts at romantic dialogue were unimaginative and repetitive."
1,NO SUPPORT,I had Greeting Card Factory 2 and loved it. Received Version 5and it would not load past disc 2. Called the company and they promised to send return information. Never came. E-mailed them No Answer. Don't know if I would buy their products ever again.
2,disappointed,"Bought it, used it, went back to doing cards with Microsoft Publisher. Non-intuitive feel, poor menus, poor graphics handling."
1,Not impressed,I haven't used this product much at all. This is probably very nce for those who simply want a quick card without having to go to the store. It is not user friendly for those who want to do a lot of creating on their own. I only use the blank template for text purposes which I could have done on a program thats already on my computer. I simply didnt like it and wouldnt recommend it. I'm glad it was only 13 bucks. It may work out better for those willing to read the 'catalog' of instructions that came with the software. I wasn't willing.
3,Very good except for one glitch,"I have used Greeting Card Factory Deluxe for quite awhile and just upgraded to 5.0. I frequently like to send electronic greetings and have done so with no problems in the previous version. In 5.0 I went to a lot of trouble to design my own electronic greeting but when I went to send it there was no option to do so. The instructions say that the option to send such a greeting is under the file menu as it was in previous versions. However, it isn't there. It isn't just greyed out. It isn't there at all. This is a disappointment to me."
2,"Very rigid, poorly designed product","While ""Greeting Card Factory Deluxe"" may have plenty of graphics the program is not worth the $60 I shelled out for it. The program seems to be designed for people who just want to choose a project and print it. For example, trying to be creative with calendars is extremely difficult. Further, if you make a change on one month of the calendar (e.g. dragging the calendar days) it applies to all the months.Too rigid! Don't buy it! I'm going to try and get my money back!"
2,custopmer service is bad,The program has some good points but does have problems printing some of the cards. For example one card I got the graphics 2 and 1/2 times or the front of the card email to tec support came back with some suggestion like get new drivers for your printer reload the software none of which helped they said call them then you sit of hold for 30 minutes. Still haven't gotten an answer. The rebate has been almost 4 months and now they say we will cut the check in a week or two. The company needs to look into it's customer service.
3,Honeymoon Interrupted by Gold,"THE TREASURE HUNT by Tom Pace begins slow and I almost put it down, but once the couple recover from their newly married status the pace of the story begins. Jeff Dunning marries Celia, a girl he barely knows and Celia has had a life time of problems.A souvenir Jeff picks up from the ocean floor near their motel turns out to be a prized piece of eight. Jeff is content with the first finds as he is on his way to a new job with a new bride and a new future. For Celia the lack of money has chained her to a way of life she is desperate to escape.Celia visits an old girl friend who relays news of her find to an old boy friend of Celia's she wants to leave behind. Celia is abducted to force Jeff to lead other interested parts to the ""find."" The chase is on with several bodies left in the wake of conflicting ambitions.A light mystery.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS"
2,Bed and Breakfast Ireland,"This book is not very useful for the average visitor to Ireland (one month or less...). It only lists one B&B per town, if that; while the descriptions are very detailed, this does not give the reader much to go on. If you want a broader view, you will want to find a different guide. For my purposes (2 week visit), it was not useful."
2,less than thrilled,"I ordered this book to help me with planning our vacation in Ireland. This book left me less than thrilled. The selection was not there, with 1 or 2 property's in each town, only a few had more. I need pictures and more info to make my plans. Sorry to say this was not the book I need."
5,Most Helpful travel book on ireland,"We stayed at one of the nicest places we have ever stayed at, thanks to this book. Pick out a B&B, check out the web site, give them a call, then go. We are going back!"
3,Possible History,Some interesting possibilities of how history would have been changed. Slavery would have ended on it's own with time. All the lives lost could have been saved. But freedom for the slaves would have drug on for another generation. Who's to say...?
3,confederate states,"failed to grip, 65% what did happen and the rest what might have occured. lacked spark and far too academic"
1,The wrong execution of the right idea,"Ransom gets it all wrong here. Counterfactual history is extremely useful in showing historical causation, as well as valuating the outcomes, but if it's done poorly it becomes fiction. There is a very thin line between fictional and counterfactual works, and what divides the two camps is a solid methodology. Ransom is too accepting of even the most flimsy ""what-ifs"" because he's not willing to limit himself to the options that the historical players considered themselves. Yes, what if aliens came down and nuked the earth? What if all of the Native-Americans in North American ganged up on the North during the war? What if, what if, what if? The thing that keeps counterfactual history from sounding foolish is methodology accepted by most scholars. They produce the works of counterfactual scholarship. Ransom has created something entirely different, and it should be avoided."
2,"Decent build but size not accurate as described, 5 1/8 inches =130.175 mm width","Nicely built sunglasses...for my 7 year old. I have always worn wide frame glasses due to my large face. While the description of this item says fits medium to large faces, I felt dizziness while I put these on due to the legs cutting off the blood supply to my temporal arteries. I then asked my wife and my 7 year old to try these on, these glasses fit them well because of their small faces. I then measured the glasses from temple to temple at the widest distance, it's 5 1/8 inches, 130mm width (medium to large???) It would be very helpful for Amazon to list the measurements under product info as everyone's perception of ""medium to large"" is very different. Measure your face before you buy."
2,Does not fit medium to large faces,"Although these say it fits medium to large faces, that is misleading. They would only fit a woman or a small man's face. Other then that they are well constructed."
3,Small and Cheap,A little small for me and cheap. Good cheap back-up pair of glasses but not for main glasses use. Would be good for kids.
2,"Lenses fine, frames cheap, sized for a teenage boy","at $17 you don't expect a lot, but I did think that the frames would be nicer than what you can pick up on Venice Beach for ten-bucks. Even so, I'd be fine with them if they weren't sized for a teenage boy or young woman. My head is within a normal man-size range and you can definately see these bowing out to get around my ears. The frames do not make it all the way to my temples. The small size would be fair enough if it were listed... but it's not."
4,Sorcerer Hunter's Final Cut,"I thouht this was a good anime. I don't think it has a very good plot, but it's still good. It didn't really explain about the people, but you can still understand all the characters and their mission. What caught my was the songs. And Carrot is so funny. He may be nasty, but by the end of the episodes, he mellows out. I totally recommend this tape to the ones who like humor."
4,WOW! Not what I was expecting,"Ok, the main reason I held off on this series was the box. It makes it look really adult (even though episode three is a little kinky). There is no nudity in the whole tape, and even though the costumes are skimpy they are still cover up the characters pretty well. The first three episodes are great, and very Slayersesque. This is sort of a Slayers for mid to older teens were Slayers is more Junior High type stuff. Still this show is funny, and well done with some great voice acting, and (surprisingly) complex main characters. OH! and the OS and ES are GREAT!"
3,A great series...but a little perverted.,"I really really liked the first two episodes on this tape. They were really funny...I really enjoyed them. The females transformation thing was a little bit scary but I enjoyed it...however in the third episode (yes ADV released a third ep on one tape scary) they had to whip Carrot to change him back to a human...at this point a video tape that would have gotten 4.5 stars from me fell to 3 stars. I give the first two episodes a solid 5 but why did they have to add the whip thing. Oh and the voice acting for the sub taped takes 6 stars due to the fact that it has Megumi Hayshibara (Slayers, Blue Seed, Cultural Cat Girl, a billion others) in it."
1,My Bad Purchase,The Item purchased was defective and they took it back but to this day I have not gotten my refund. If this is the way you treat your clients I will never buy anything from Amazon again.
3,It's a Good TV But,"My search for good picture for this was not shown, It's allot bigger then thought, It's tube TV for some reason of my own fault. I did not understand. Thought was LCD TV, Lot of Ad's don't show all, It a buyer beware issue. But over all It's a Great TV"
4,so cute,"This is good quality, the only problom is when your cat scratches it, it makes some threds pop out. It has a lot of adjustments for sizes. it is perfect for your cute kitten."
1,Doesn't last well,"When my cat was a kitten I got her one of these collars and within 1 or 2 months the collar was tattered and broken.Good if you want a moderately cute, simple collar that won't last long.It's overall a bad collar and you may want to invest in a more durable one if you are wanting a collar that could last a good amount of time."
1,Terrible!!,"I made the HUGE mistake of picking up this DVD prior to reading anything about it. The back of the package tells you to ""Indulge yourself with these two easy-to-follow fat burning modern dance style segments . . . ."" Easy to follow?? Absolutely not. If you have quite a bit of prior dance experience, then you'll probably have no problem. Fat burning?? Unless, again, you are an experienced dancer and can really get into the routine, the super short and super confusing segments won't do anything to get your heart pumping."
3,bad quality method,"I'm very keen on ""dance"" fitness. So I was very excited with ""The Method"" series which offer a combination jazz dance, toning, cardio workouts. Now this ""New Method"" looks like recycled home videos or videos that somebody taped off a TV show and decided to make a buck. By the time you start to sweat, the workouts are over. This tape is good for warm-ups or for clock-watchers but it's definitely a step back for ""The Method"" franchise."
2,complex cardio,"I bought this tape at a discount store because of the low price. I always watch my fitness videos first then try to actually do the moves. As I watched, I knew I would never be able to do this video. The moves are complex for someone with no dance background. The instructors demonstrate the moves, but use dance terms to describe them. If you have done jazz or other type of dance in the past, you would really like this. If you are not coordinated, go for something else."
1,The Worst!,"I also made the mistake of buying this video before reading comments from others. BIG mistake! This video is awful. I have tons of fitness videos and have never bought one as bad as this. I am fairly coordinated and can do other dance fitness videos, but this was beyond me. I don't want to spend hours and hours trying to get the steps so I can get my workout in. In fact,it wouldn't give a decent workout, even if you could do all of the dance steps. The description on the cover is totally false and misleading. I also bought The Method-Step Up To Dance and don't like that one either. No cuing. No advance practice steps. Another awful video. No more The Method for me! Don't waste your money! If I could have rated these videos with ZERO stars, I would have!"
2,this is not a workout,"Agree with the other reviews.Each dance segment is less than 20 minutes and does not get your heart pumping at all. When you get the choreography by the second viewing, the tape becomes pretty useless because of all the pauses in between to break down the steps.This should have been a straight 40 minute dance cardio tape Lisa Wheeler looks like a good jazz teacher.The floor work also does nothing either.Very very disappointing, even a brisk walk would be a better warm-up, it's not even enough of a warm up before I do my Tae-Bo DVD."
1,Professional dancers only,"I should have known better. The new graphics and updated name blinded me to the fact that I had made unhappy purchases from this line before (when it was called simply The Method).Talk about false advertising. The routines are impossible to follow. The instructors never mention potential dangers due to bad form. Given the pace and confusion, I'm sure all my movements demonstrate bad form! All I get from this is irritation."
1,Notice: Dance Experience Required!,"I bought this workout thinking that it would be a great opportunity to get my heart rate up at home. I guess I didn't realize that you need to be a trained dancer to understand what's going on. Moves much too quickly (even after 4 or 5 tries I'm still not sure how to do most of the steps) - I usually just end up dancing around trying to work in some of the moves as I can. If you're going to spend your money on a cardio workout and you're not a dancer, I highly recommend getting something else."
3,So-So,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This video is definitely not for people with limited dance experience. The first segment moves fairly quickly into some intermediate steps/sequences, and there isn't much time given to learn the steps one by one. I've not had much dance experience, and I got discouraged rather quickly."
4,Emerson and the East,"This thin volume gives the essentials of Emerson's devotion to the Eastern wisdom tradition, in particular Advaita Vedanta, the Eastern philosphy of unity. Paramananda offers very little actual commentary of the similarities between Emerson and Vedanta, but he does offer comparable passages from both sources, allowing the careful reader to see the subtle as well as obvious connections. This book, or rather booklet, is an excellent and necessary beginning for anyone beginning a study of Emerson and his eastern influences."
1,Don't expect it to last,I thought I would be using it for years based on the other reviews. I followed the directions and it didn''t last through one cycle. In the trash in just over a month!
4,Great tumbler,"Purchased this tumbler for the kids. After weeks of picking up rocks from Lake Michigan, I decided to buy this tumbler to get the kids interested in what they actually found. At each step, the kids changed out the tumbler mixed according to directions, and the process was not only fun, it was educational. This tumbler made it easy and mess-manageable."
4,Great spirited sequel to one of the most imaginative works,"Allamanda is a sequel to long atmospheric, difficult to read, but ultimately brilliant Arcady. If you are a fan of Little Big, read these books. Mr Williams, may I have another?"
3,Typical Judson Philips/Hugh Pentecost Fare,"Judson Philips/Hugh Pentecost was a prolific writer. His books are fast-paced, readable, but not memorable. ""The Power Killers"" is typical: Fair plot, cardboard characters, and heavy-handed preachy philosophy.Protagonist Peter Styles (good guy with a capital G) meets with Idealistic Young Man who claims to have explosive secret knowledge about sinister conspiracy of the 'rich and powerful'. Of course IYM doesn't tell Styles anything concrete at first meeting, and before the next meeting there is an attack on IYM and his girlfriend. Girlfriend is killed, and IYM vanishes after swearing vengeance. Etc, etc, etc."
4,Good product with limited life,This is a good phone intercom/door phone for panasonic systems.After about 10 yrs. The rubber parts inside deteriorate and the unit needs to be replaced
2,Not Ideal for Natural Hair,"Doo Grow Thickening Hairdress received 2 stars for several reasons. First, the price is a rip off. I saw this same product at the local dollar store for $4 less than what it is selling for here. Secondly, because I was looking for a hairdress without many harsh chemicals and one that was ideal for 4b type hair, I was disappointed to see that petroleum is one the first listed on the ingredients list. As research shows, petroleum is not good for most individuals with 4b type hair because petroleum blocks pores of the scalp resulting in slow hair growth. Third, the product is thick and makes my hair greasy even if I use a small amount. For every negative characteristic, I deducted one star. The main good quality about this product is that it has a nice smell. For African American women looking to transition to natural hair or who already have natural hair, I would not recommend this product."
2,Quite greasy,"Doo gro usually gets stellar reviews from nearly everyone, but the product is so greasy and it clogs your scalp! It doesn't penetrate it; it sits on top of your scalp. I used it after a wash, and instead of having moisturized hair when it dried, I had dry and crispy tresses. I like to use the optimum hair dress line, and I wanted to try something different."
1,A waste of money,"These African-American hair products are so bad, I would not accept them for free. They do not cause hair growth especially in natural hair rather they clog your pores and cause hair loss."
3,Sparse,"I was expecting a huge book full of pictures and information, and while there are pictures and good information, it's rather sparse. I'm surprised at how few books are available on the subject of jewelry in history, considering it's nearly the only thing we have left of many cultures. If you are desperate for any information on beads in history, this is a good starting place, but I was left wanting more."
5,Couldnt put it down!,"In Disposable Heroes Dan gives us an outstanding insight into the world of EMS and those who work in the field not for recognition or a pat on the back but to help a fellow human being, This book shows the bonds and friendships that are made and last a lifetime with those who answer the cry of a strangers pain 24/7 .... 365 days a year.... As an EMT Paramedic myself, I could not put the book down whether I was in the front of the truck or laying in my bunk.... I would recommend this book for anyone, whether you are a brand new EMT or someone who is simply interested in EMS, Thank you for this outstanding book Dan keep up the strong work!"
4,An honest account,"I've read just about every book written about the EMS profession. Some are great and some aren't so great. I really liked this one. The thing I really liked about it was that it was written for other EMS readers. It's almost as if the author was relating these stories out on the ambulance dock at the ER. He didn't try to explain everything like many of these books geared toward the lay public do. He talks about ""slamming an IV"" or ""dropping a tube"" and doesn't bother providing a lengthy description of what they mean. That makes for a faster read for those of us who've worked in the field. Entertaining stories told in an entertaining fashion. I highly recommend this one."
4,This 1987 book is still worth reading.,"The book may be 15 years old, but nearly every litigator could benefit from reading it and adopting the author's recommendations for clear and direct court papers. Law students and new lawyers, too, would be better off in the long run if they started their careers by mimicking this book and the forms it suggests.It covers complaints, answers, discovery documents, motions, briefs, orders, and more. The text is easy to read and is tied closely to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The author is an experienced litigator with lots of practical advice to offer.I recommend this book, but it does need to be updated to reflect both the current version of the Federal Rules and a more contemporary writing style."
2,can't actually play a match in tour mode,"I just bought this game, relying on other reviews here on the site, explaining that in tour mode, you can switch off mission play and play 'normal' mode, which means you can play as you'd expect.Well, I have to disagree, as I'd actually expect to play a FULL MATCH. You never get to play a match in tour mode...the maximum you get to play is a set (6 games). In the qualifying rounds, you only get to play TWO GAMES! (you never even get to play a whole set until the final match in a tournament!).The gameplay and physics are amazing...just beware that you don't actually get to play a set....there will be no dramatics, like squeaking through a set, dropping one, and then coming back to win the third, at least not in Pro Tour mode (the only mode I'm interested in playing)."
3,Fun but hard game - honest review,"I think I can agree with the rest of the reviewers that this is the better of tennis games for Playstation 2. I have not played Top Spin though. Anyway, Smash Court 2 is very fun to play, it gets your competitive juices flowing, but this game is very difficult to win matches on - even on the easy level. I don't think I suck at this game or at video games in general. I find the player movement on screen is often not as fast as I would like in order to get to the ball. Now I am not an avid real tennis player as it seems from a lot of the other reviewers that they are, and it these people that appreciate this game the most. So perhaps this is why I find this game so hard."
4,My 2 cents on serves,"There are some complaints about serves in this game. I have some experiences. I get at least 1 aces every game. For some weak opponents, I score a game by 4 straight aces. The trick is to use the direction buttons instead of left stick to control your serves! To receive a serve, remember to react early. So when I played against Andy Roddick in US Open, I never let him serve an ace. Instead, I served two aces to knock him out!Hope this is useful for someone."
4,smash court tennis 2-this game is smashing and is an ace,"with number 2 in the world -Andy roddick- and the gorgeous Anna Konakova in this game you cant go wrong.An addictive sequal , the person who thought of this must have had an epiphany.a fun game to play with ur chums. doubles although hard is very enjoyable. andy is ginger. i would love to play this game for once instead of watchin ppl play tennis and in conclusion i ave ginger titties"
1,This is a question,"I have not played this game but i want it but i would like to know who all the players on this game are, all 16 of them."
4,air hose reel,"a light duty reel thats easy to mount any where, I built a flat dolly and mounted the reel next to my compressor that is on the same dolly. When not in use it fits under one of my work benches ready to go where ever I need it. No hunting for the hose or looking for a place to store it works good for me."
2,"Just ok, lacking","The 3-D graphics are a bit primitive, but you'll catch a certain sense of what made these 'wonders' so great in Greek and Roman times. The talking heads are all stuffed shirt Brits, but they stitch the tales together adequately."
4,EASY READ,"I love this book!!! Very easy to use and follow, explanations are in english not tech words. I started to create my first website using dreamweaver 8, I read the book it came with, and didn't understand what I was doing. After reading the first two chapters of dreamweaver 8 for dummies, I was starting to create a website like a pro."
2,Not For Dummies....,"I am not new to computers and I am a good student, who is able to grasp materials. However this book is hard to follow, the writer uses a lot of expressions that are NOT for dummies, without real explanations. There are certain parts of the book that are well organized but in overall the writer doesn't seem focused. She keeps touching several subjects in one chapter, without really making a point, therefore it's confusing. I have no doubt that the writer does know Dreamweaver well, however this book seems to miss the concept and the thematics to be able to understand even for dummies."
4,A fun way to learn web design,"This easy to use book in the ""Dummy's"" format walks you thru the steps in web design from start up to up and running."
2,Misses the mark.,"I am new to web design but am pretty good with computers. I have been producing and editing music for fun for years. This book is dicey at best. There are good points, but overall it is hard to follow and gives a poor explaination of Dreamweaver's features. Hopefully, the author is better in the classroom than she is in this text or I feel sorry for her students."
2,Very very mediocre GPS system,"Compared to other GPS systems I have used this one would rate very mediocre. I picked this up at Costco for 350 -25 rebate, plus tax in NYC would be about 350. I purposely bought it at Costco because they have a no questions asked return policy. The minute I started using it, it started to glitch. Addresses, roads, on/off, reset, functions, and a few other things that just glitched once in a while. I would not recommend this GPS just simply because it was not well made and the software in the system is just flawed. I will be returning it in about a month after I am done playing with it."
