5,Smiths & Petshop boys combined wow,You cant go wrong mixing Johnny mars guitar sound with pet shop boys vocals. It is awesome sounding beautifully recorded album. I love it alot. Its very smooth. I think its one of their best albums.
5,"Beautiful, moving and excellently written","Victoria Lustbader's HIDDEN is a book that is filled with amazing characters. These characters living in New York City at the beginning of the 20th century, share a story that will keep you reading. It's beautifully written, with delicious details of life at that time. I would recommend this book for men and women alike, or anyone who likes a good story."
2,Off the mark,"While I applaud Ms. Lustbader's attempts on her first novel, I have to admit that the story was completely flat. Although filled with several well-thought-out characters, not one of them was lovable in any way, leaving the reader with no one to sympathise with. An arrogant social climber, an overbearing mother, a wimpy son with no mind of his own, a broken woman, a cold father, a guilt-tripping abandoned sister... I would think that at least one of them would have had some soul. And while the story was very detail oriented, it just seemed a little too contrived and cliche."
3,Shin Megami Tensei on the GO!,"I'll be honest here. This game is far from perfect and far from being one of the best games on the GBA. What makes this game fun and great ultimately depends on how much you like Japanese style rpgs and the Shin Megami Tensei series. If your a huge fan like me then youll love the idea of fusing demons on the go and being able to play with gods and demons on the go. The story and graphics get the job done. The gameplay should be familiar to fans and holds up well if your not expecting a masterpiece. I honestly had a lot of fun with it, I take it for what it is and remember that i only paid 10 bucks for it. If you take that all into account then you cant really go wrong if you need to satisfy your need for SMT on the go."
3,Another low-class Pokemon clone,"Demi-kids can seem like a great game, and it's fun the first time through. However, like pokemon, it's a monster collection game. There are assorted methods of collecting demons, and the entire thing can get frustrating if you try to capture everything (if such a thing is possible).Unlike traditional RPGs, the monsters in your party (which are called demons, even the ones that look like angels and are classified as ""holy"") level up by fusing with each other in order to either enhance their stats or morph into a single, stronger monster.The game has no re-play value, but it is sorta fun. However, don't buy both versions unless you REALLY like the one you try first."
4,Performs as expected,"We bought this to help my wife head off migraines and it does so admirably. However, the tasted, as with other Coca teas we've had, leaves a little something to be desired - very grassy in my opinion. However, since it was purchased more for its medicinal value than its flavor, we're quite happy with it."
2,"Not what I ordered, but good anyway","I received a different box on Mate De Coca, not from Delisse.I wanted specifically Delisse which I bought in Peru. However the box I received was Mate de Coca and good nonetheless."
1,What a waste,"Awful no value and my bag was black. Tastes like dirty water. I am so disappointed, thought I was getting something to help with my fibromyalgia."
1,what a disappointment!!,"yes it is tea of some sort, who know what sort of tea, but numbness??? where??? I made a pot with 8 teabags, very strong, thinking to approach with caution, well after the whole pot of tea, nothing stimulating, nothing numbing in the least,(if you want numbing try kava kava tincture) no nothing!!! I am very sensitive to stimulants and this does not have any of that sort of effect, really a drag, don't know what they sold me, but not the real thing, I have been to Peru, I know what the effects are suppose to be, what a let down...."
5,Anno's Masks a Delight for New Readers,"I respectfully disagree with the publisher's review that this book is ""pointless"". Young children, just learning to read, learning geometric shapes (math!!), and exploring the wonderful world of make believe and their own imaginations, find this book to be quite delightful!! The only thing better than a good book? A well-loved, well-worn book!!"
5,Great Supplement!,I have been taking one spoon every day more than 6 months and I loved it! I have arthritis and this is one of the product that is helping me. I recommend it!
2,the taste is really hard to overcome,i'm confident that this product does its job supplying magnesium.i'm not a person sensitive to bad medicine taste. but the taste of this takes it to a new level. it is simply awful. even when mixed with juices it is still very bad.won't buy again
2,Sado-masachistic,"The cover of the hardback says, ""In the bestselling tradition of Dick Francis."" Anyone familiar with Francis will recall that toward the end of his career, he began inflicting a lot of bodily harm on his heroes. Well, that's the tradition Lyndon Stacey has chosen to adopt for this book. Her hero is beaten up, bitten by a horse, thrown from his motorbike at least twice, almost killed in a fire, trampled by donkeys, etc.If that isn't enough to turn you off, Stacey would have you believe that this artist-animal behaviorist can ""converse"" mentally with horses, dogs, you name it--which comes in handy when he has to catch a ""wild"" stallion with his hand tied and blind-folded.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR THE REALISTIC, WEAK-HEARTED NOR FOR THOSE WHO LIKE WELL ROUNDED CHARACTERS. It ain't sexy nor romantic either."
5,An informative adventure,"Inspiring! Sensational! An informative adventure that will direct you on the path to a successful college experience."""
3,Moments to Remember,I want to buy the sheet music. do you know how to do this? I love this song and want to perform it at a 50 year reunion.
3,"Good beginning, but it gets tedious and boring at the end","I love Deep Space Nine, and I also love the Dominion War, so I really anticipated the new series. After reading the first book, I was let down. It starts out great, with a lot of action. The only problem I had was that Jem'Hadar battlecruisers kept popping up everywhere, but you usually never see those, you only see attack ships. Plus, why does the Enterprise always lower her shields before firing? They never had to do that before. Once Picard starts on his way, it's still good, but near the end, it left me hoping that L.A. Graf would somehow get to write Tunnel Through the Stars, not John Vornholt."
4,"Inventive, Creative and Engaging",This story provided everythning I enjoy in a Star Trek Book. It was very easy to read and did a wonderful job of providing excellent visual descriptions. I can't wait to read the next one written by Diane Carey.
2,All the hype about it wasn't true,"Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek series, and I've watched all of them, even that pathetic Voyager series. So when I heard they were going to make a novel series about the Dominion War, I was excited. When I read the first story, Behind Enemy Lines, I thought it wasn't very good. I was hoping for a lot of action, and there is, but there are some strange things. Such as: why does the Enterprise lower its shields every time it fires? It never had to before. And the Jem'Hadar ships are way too powerful. If it was a battleship, I'd undestand. But you don't see those alot in the Dominion fleet. So one Jem'Hadar ship couldn't possibly destroy an Ambassador-class starship, unless it was a battleship. Besides that, it's an average book. The beginning is excellent, then it degenerates into just another book. The real highlight besides the beginning is the Corzanium. That's a real original idea. But no matter what, I wish L.A. Graf would've written this."
2,Skip to the next...,"Nothing goes on, you don't really care what happens next since it's not really intersting. I've read quite a few st books by now and this one is probably the most eventless. If I were you, I would skip to the next right now."
4,Fast-paced excitement in the Star Trek universe,"In Behind Enemy Lines, the first book in the Dominion War series, John Vornholt creates a no-nonsense science fiction adventure novel that fleshes out an important part of the Star Trek universe. The story is set during the all-out war that takes place between the Federation and the Dominion-Cardassian alliance, sometime after the fall of Deep Space Nine. The plot is quite interesting and concerns a secret Dominion project that threatens to end the war once and for all. Vornholt supports the story greatly by crafting detailed characters that seem genuinely affected by the devastating nature of the war going on around them. Add to this an abundance of exciting action sequences, and the result is a highly entertaining Star Trek adventure that leaves the reader greatly anticipating the next novel in the Dominion War series."
4,"Good book, well-written.","This book succeeds at what it sets out to be: an excellent action-based story set during the Dominion War against the Cardassians and the Founders. It makes little to no attempt to be more than that, so if you're in the mood for something more than a good action story, this isn't what you're looking for. But if that's what you're in the mood for, this will do just fine."
4,good,Great book. I just skiped to book three becouse as far as could tell book two and four are the same as the show.
4,"Get to Know the Character, less so his Work","This book will leave you with a good feel for the man and what drove him, but the technical side of his achievements is lacking. Extraordinary he certainly was, but somewhat less admirable than his reputation would suggest.The book is well written and it describes Brunel's times as well as his character excellently. I would have been more interested in how such impressive engineering feats were achieved when the mathematical methods and the physical means of realising them were so rudimentary. But it was still a good read and kept me engrossed from cover to cover."
5,South Asian Saddam Hussain.,"U may never heard of Him. However that is not the case. He is unknown yet he is not unimportant to understand. Those boys who mastered suicide bombings in the 20 th century and took it to phenomenal ""success"" rates are Tamil Tigers. And this book is the critical biography of the person who heads it.This is a meticulously researched and remain a synthesis. Reading this book would give u the insights of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Suharto, South American Dictators and even Georgr bush Snr."
2,Not a Honest Book...Defenitely,This book is written to blame the Tigers & its supremo and thereby de-moralising the Liberation Struggle going on in Eelam. This book does not detail the Sinhala Chauvinistic attitudes and the Genocide committed by them on Tamils. Defenitely not a Honest Book.
4,Great utility for recuperation,"Had a bad accident cleaning a swimming pool last year (2012) and tore 3 of my rotator cuff muscles loose from the socket in my shoulder. Too hard to get in the tub, can't stand in the shower, last resort was bird bath and I thought of this handy little helper. My weight is about a quarter less than 300 lbs. This baby never even flinched when I sat on it. Very sturdy, an excellent helper in the tub. Also durable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs help in the bath."
4,"Good, sturdy shower bench","I'm an overweight woman and my weight is right on the edge of needing a bariatric vs. a regular shower bench. I felt unstable on the regular bench and so purchased this one. It's sturdy, easy to clean and stable. My only problem is that I can't make it any taller. It is adjustable but there are only 5 leg heights and being tall, I would prefer it to be a couple of inches taller. I use it for showering and I also sit on it in at my bathroom counter to dry my hair and apply my makeup."
4,Bath Bench XL,Product met all needs and gave support needed. In looking back on product purchase I should have included the back on unit; it would have improved stability. Product function still met my need.
3,OK bath bench,"This would be a great product. EXCEPT the description says it adjusts from 14.5"" to 19.5"" in height. For me, even the 19.5"" height is almost too low. So I was VERY disappointed and upset when my new bath bench arrived and the tags say it adjusts from 14"" to 17"" high. If I manage to get all the way down to sit on this bench, I CANNOT get back up. So I have to return this and buy another bath bench. The price was great, I love the suction feet. But the description is WRONG. If the bench height is important, this is not the bath bench for you."
3,legs too short for tall people,"This chair has great workmanship, and is strong enough. Just wish it had another 4-6 inches height."
2,seat is not sturdy,the legs are very sturdy and easy to adjust. The seat however is junk. There are 4 bolts which screw into the seat from the bottom so after sitting on the seat for a bit those bolt ends start to push through the top plastic layer of the seat. If this chair had been $25 - $30 I would not really mind but since I paid nearly $70 I am very upset with the purchase.
3,Short,"Bought this to replace an older model not even considering this stool would be made so sturdy to carry a lot of weight for short people! I'm only 5'6"" and it's too short for me."
4,Better Choice,I purchased a similar bath bench -- almost identical. That previous purchase did not last more than 2 weeks from normal use. The design flaws of the previous bench prompted me to buy this model. What was needed is the crossbars on the legs to give the bench added support to the leg structure. This bench is very stable and a better design that will last longer.
3,bath bench,"I love that you can raise or lower the height of this bench. But I don't know why they call it a bench, it should be called seat. It's not that large of a seat. Also if you stand up for any reason while bathing the bench seems to move backwards with slight pressure from your legs. So be careful and don't sit back down until you are sure the seat is under you. It would be better if the legs had suctions cups on them to adhere to the tub and therefore not move."
2,Very Nice,This bench is well made and very suitable for it's purpose. We are tall people and I just wish it was a little higher. Other than that i would recommend it.
5,"""The Best Vegan Cookbook I`ve Found.""","For anyone looking for a great vegan cookbook that combines the healthest in grains,veggies and oils,this is it. Very well laid out with sections on soups,salads,vegetables,grains,dressings,sauces& dips and desserts.Christine uses a nice variety of herbs to make for real tasty dishes.With lots of information on PH balancing and cleansing a must for good health. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Halloween fun,"Wounderful DVD, a must buy for any Nickelodeon halloween fan! Although, I do agree with the other reveiw I do think that they should have put the older Rugrats halloween episode on here. Still a great buy though!"
4,Creative metal working,I am pleased with the performance of this tool and would recomend its purchase to all who do fine metal work The item arrived in a timely manner and performed as was discribed
5,Great Cut-Off Wheels,"If you have never tried these with your Dremel, then you are missing out. These things work great for cutting all kinds of metal."
5,great product for cutting thru metal in small places,"I have used this product many times in the past and I was replenishing my supply. Great accessory for cutting off ends of screws that stick out, cutting nails that come out the other side, many valuable uses."
2,Not the best Step Workout,This instructor goes right into the steps without much instruction. I can see how this workout could be fun once you know the steps but trying to learn them without guidance is very frustrating. The other frustrating part is the camera work. There are too many close up views of the instructors face. You are not able to see what steps they are doing when the camera is in on a close up. I would not buy this DVD again or recommend it to anyone.
2,Juan Gabriel Y Yo,"The book is thin and can be read through one sitting, it has few pictures of Juan Gabriel and the men he was involved with. I paid purchase for $189.00 because I had been told it was the only collectible book left in stock, but now that I see another book is put to sell I feel robbed. Because I gave it as a gift to my mother who had been wanting to read this book for a long time I decided to buy it. If anyone is compelled to buy this book be warned that the worth of your money may not guarantee the worth you're expecting from this book."
1,The book was as boring and shallow as the author's mind.,"Bob Grant's only talent is rudeness and ad hominem attacks. That comes through in the book as glaringly as it does over the air. Whining and griping, Grant jumps from one subject to the next without offering any intelligent solutions to the issues presented. No wonder mature conservatives are embarrassed by Grant. Grant hurts himself in his book. He sketches an unflattering self-portrait of an effeminate aristocrat who never really worked in his life, toughed out military service, or cared about genuine abuses endured by minorities. We see a hypocrite whose heart never ""went out"" to the victims' families in the O.J. Simpson case. Grant's boring book reveals the narcissism of a fake ""conservative"" whose heart is centered on himself -- a kid who belongs in junior high school, not on radio. Browse through Bob's scribbling in your library (if they have it), but don't waste a penny on a book whose title should be ""Let ME Be Heard."""
2,Republican Yes-Man for AM Radio,"As an independent voter, Bob Grant makes it hard to vote Republican; a few weeks listening to the Bob Grant Show on my way home from work has certainly put me off GW for this November. While undoubtedly a clever man, the intolerance in this man's speech is sickening, amusing and bewildering all at the same time. What's worse is that his show comes under the guise of a forum of free speech, when in actuality it is entirely one-sided. For all his distaste with the mainstream media, I think if he sat back for a minute and consulted with liberals he would find an equal amount of disgust with what so many conservatives dub the ""liberal media.""While I enjoy some conservative commentators, Grant is an unapologetic Republican sycophant that make him hard to stomache and difficult to take seriously.I'd love to discuss this topic with anyone who's willing at cdgprince@netscape.net, send me a note."
1,RACIST YAHOO,"Bob Grant is a racist. He calls former Mayor David Dinkins ""a washroom attendant."" When Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's plane went down in Bosnia, Grant said, ""I am a pessimist by nature. If there is a survivor on that plane, it's probably Ron Brown."" Ron Brown died a tragic death in that crash. Bob Grant was fired from W-ABC but picked up, almost immediately, by WOR. And that alone is a travesty. He's a right-wing yahoo. Vulgar and vile."
5,A voice of the silent majority,"Bob Grant is the voice of the silent majority. He is the greatest radio talk show host; at the height of his fame in the 80s he was the most listned to man in New York City. He was so popular, so well liked and loved by so many listeners, his opposition did everything they could do to tear him apart, mostly lobbing false charges of racism. These were back in the days when if you said ANYTHING negative about David Dinkins or Al Sharpton you were labled ""hate radio"". Of course we know what failures those leaders are today. Bob Grant reserved caustic language for those people he thought were tearing the country apart. This of course angered many, and today we see the rise of ""compassionate conservatism"". Years from now we look back at Bob Grant and his message, and when America finally collapses to the decadent, the obcense, the power hungry, those who value their dollars more liberty, we will say, Bob Grant was RIGHT. Let's be heard, indeed!"
5,Bob Grant For NJ Senate!,"This book was right on the mark! Bob Grant is a gentleman and a scholar. He is the true champion of the middle class tax payer regardless are sex, race, creed!."
5,It IS what every parent longs for...,"The content of this book is phenomenal. So utterly true, inspiring, and motivating. It tells you exactly why you should pay tribute to your parents and how to do it. It was like holding onto God's hand as I wrote my tribute with the help of this book.Whether you are a Christian, Jew, another faith, agnostic, or atheist, you will be touched by the presentation of Dennis' teaching. Honoring parents using this method will renew your relationship. Whether you have experienced wonderful parents, a bad relationship, neglect, or even abuse, this book will guide and show you how honoring them will bring something incredibly positve into your life and healing to your spirit. This book shows and guides you how to forgive your parents. I'm very sorry it's out of print! The world really needs it!"
5,"If you are a Tiger or a book maniak or both as I am, you MUS","I know Dale Ritter and Alfred Rubbel personally. Rubbel is an amazing guy and in very good shape! I've just met him 2 weeks ago.I like that Rubbels book has many pictures with long captions starting with him as a recruit and then with the Panzer IV. It's an easy and fast read. He also tells some really personal stuff he first wasn't sure to do. It's a wonderfull story of an even more wonderfull man.As a Schiffer books it's beautiful and it's amazing what they made out of the small original pictures!If you are a Tiger or a book maniak or both as I am, you MUST have it.Lukash(...)"
3,Cute but not so sturdy,"I purchased this bag from a sample sale site and thought it would be a perfect carry on bag. It fit my computer, a few books, a sweatshirt, some other items for the plane, no problem. But once I started carrying it around, I found that it really couldn't handle the weight. I would say I put 10-15 pounds in the bag so, not really a lot, but enough that the bag ripped near one of the handles. I made it to my destination (2 planes, a bus, 4 airports in all...blame delayed flights) but I was pretty disappointed about the ripping fabric. Fortunately the handle stayed put so it was still functional; it was the fabric around the handle that ripped. I'll probably try some hot glue later but I dont have my hopes up.Bummer, I was really looking forward to using this as my go-to carry on. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone unless you're solely using it as a gym bag and are only putting soft, light clothes in it."
4,Baggy in the seat,"I got these for my husband and ordered his normal size but the jeans are WAY baggy in the crotch, which makes them very uncomfortable for him. I bought 2 pairs and I'll be returning the pair he didn't wear - he's hoping a good wash in hot water will make the others wearable. They're perfectly good jeans otherwise (which is why I gave them 4 stars), maybe my husband is just too slim for them. He also won't wear his pants at the natural waist (he doesn't really have one!), he wears them at the hip so that might have something to do with it as well, although I don't know many men (blue collar-types like us especially) who wear their pants at the natural waist!"
2,Like but dont like,The jeans I ordered are the same size that I buy in regular Wranglers but the size is to small in the waist and way to long in the length. I wore one pair to work and was so uncomfortable that I haven't even took the other pair out of the package. I will continue to order from Amazon and also wear Wranglers.
5,THESE JEANS RULE!,"I seriously don't know what they put in these, but I've had these for years crawling around in ducts, on my knees on concrete floors, and doing auto/carpentry work and STILL haven't worn through the knees. They don't seem to stain as easily either. The ""Durashield"" actually lives up to its name and the jeans still look virtually new. I have the indigo color and they have faded to a regular blue over the years, but no fraying anywhere. My clip knife lives in the front right pocket and the leather patch is quite useful, all my other jeans have developed a frayed pocket there, not these.Get some, they're awesome!"
3,Useful,"Purchased for use in an intensive Latin course, the grammar offers very good examples of English constructions and then compares them to their Latin counterpart. Worth purchasing."
2,Becoming a bit stale...,"The material is becoming a bit dated now with the continued inclusion of psychoanalytic theory, the Chinese ""danger"" and ""opportunity"" symbols refuted by language scholars, and too many offensive terms. For example, on page 5 decribes veterans suffering from PTSD as those who have ""turnstiled through VA hospitals,"" and page 280 on substance abuse includes an example of a ""passerby who gives a street bum a handout,"" so that ""the bum is enable to buy the wine."" Some fresh talent is needed to revive this book."
2,Skip the profanity,"A fairly good text, it probably covers the field better than other available sources. However, the selection of illustrations seem to be chosen based on how much profanity they can include. I realize that crisis situations involve people who don't monitor their usage, but why include every F--- and other curse word when they aren't needed to convey the meaning.I teach large classes and probably won't adopt this title because of the gratuitous inclusion of verbal static."
3,From a grad student's point of view,"The book itself was in good condition, but it is a difficult book to read and hard to get through."
3,For the individual with no crisis planning and services experience.,"As required for licensure, I used this text for the mandated Crisis Intervention post-master's course. In addition to basic mental health crisis intervention, the book primarily focuses on crisis response, crisis planning, and other concepts introduced to the general public by FEMA and HRSA after the events of 9/11.I suppose if you are not familiar with the planning component, and do not want to take the time to search through the free FEMA and Red Cross files on the net, you'll have a brief, one-stop shopping experience with this text. And, I also suppose this is ""stuff"" one should probably know for administrator level position within human service organizations. However, be warned...this is great theory that academics want you to know. But in the real world, the plan in written and put on a shelf."
3,Good Information,"I work as a Crisis Intervention Specialist for a hospital, so I thought that this information would be useful, as I was taking a graduate level class in Crisis Intervention. I think that this is a good book for someone that is just starting out, but for a seasoned veteran, I thought that it wsn't that helpful."
3,ok book,"I am not very far into this book, but so far it is a difficult read. There are many short paragraphs and seems very choppy"
4,Good but I really wish I could get this on my Kindle,Good book but why the heck can't it be sent to Kindle devices and only be read on the computer?
3,A decent take...,"Gee provides a good introduction to the use of cladistics, the study of relationships, in paleontology. He offers a good survey of contemporary (i.e., turn of the 20th C.) knowledge, but not much more.If you're just coming to the field, it's not a bad place to start. If you've done much reading at all, though, you've seen and heard it all.The book would be improved by more (and better) illustrations, a few maps perhaps, and a lot less of Mr. Gee's supposed sense of humor, which gets old very, very quickly. Fred the Cat would make a nice museum exhibition...."
3,A little bit honest...At least that's a start,"Dr. Gee is honest enough to admit that the fossil record will never be able to shed light on ancestry and descent of various species. He is not honest enough to admit that the concept of macroevolion is nothing more than fanciful, atheistic superstition."
2,Fred-istics,"The author is besotted with his cat, a cat named Fred. No chance of dropping Fred's name onto a page is missed. Gee seemingly cannot speak of a chordate, or a tetrapod, without adding a parenthesis (""you, me, Fred the cat""), just to make sure the reader grasps the concept. The book needs illustrations beyond the few rudimentary cladograms, all attributed to a mysterious Mr. Xeridat. A few good ideas are introduced in the opening chapter, namely, the concept of parsimony, in selecting conflicting possible relationships between species. But then we get back to Fred the Cat. Gee states that the Megatherium (an extinct ground sloth) was twice as heavy as a bull African elephant. From what I can find on websites, the masses are indeeed in a ratio of two to one, but in favor of the elephant, about three tons to seven. The only reason I looked this up is that it seemed so unreasonable an assertion. I urge caution in accepting all that Gee says here."
1,Was not what I wanted,I did a seach for DVD movie the main event and when it came up i ordered it what I received was a cd for the movie sound track. Not very happy. I did not want to go through the hassle of trying to return the item.
1,"Poor content, lots of repetition, very disappointing ...",I bought this book mainly because of its excellent reviews and I am very frustrated. It seems that the author just try to fill the blank. It is a very short book with not much content. I am wondering who wrote those amazing reviews if it is not the author herself!!!!
5,Works great.,"I bought this for a friend of mine. She's a senior citizen and does puzzles daily. She the glues them together and frames them. She uses them for gifts for family and friends. I asked her how the glue worked and she told me it was the best glue she had ever had. She also commented on the price as, it fit her budget perfectly. Thank you"
3,"Pioneer Onner Space: The Life of Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Hasheesh Eater","I found this book to be an honest and candid story about one man's struggle with addiction. The fact that his addiction occurred nealy a century ago is fascinating and compelling,given there was little or no therapy for recovery.Actually, I have completely read the book but from the chapters I've have read so far, I am enthralled by this book. It is a good read and relevant to many issues facing drug users today.Vondell C. Jones"
5,cafedemedici,"From oils to spices, vinegarettes to cheeses and artistic planning, this is the most beautiful salad book I've come across. I learned how to make basic and complex dressings and gained ideas on preparation and presentation to make my guests' mouth's salivate!"
4,"A moody, somber, remarkably textured score","I've seen the miniseries twice now, and both times I was left with the burning need to get my hands on the score as soon as possible. It's THAT perfect, in the context of the series itself; never overpowering, alternatively lush and minimalistic, it enhanced the action on-screen wonderfully. It doesn't stand quite as well on its own. Some of the tracks, specifically the faster-paced 'action' music, is not particularly remarkable when heard in isolation, but the score more than makes up for it in other places. The slower tracks are the real highlights of this album. They range from moody and majestic (Main Theme), to romantic (Paul and Chani, Chani and Paul's Love), to ethereal (Paul's Vision, Jessica Changes The Water), all of which manage to be evocative of the Arrakeen desert, with all its beauty and danger. Simply put, this is Graeme Revell at his best, and the few weak tracks are more than overcome by the strength of the rest of the album."
5,Adds a touch of the exotic to Dune,"I'll be honest, I hadn't watched or thought of the Sci-Fi Dune miniseries in years. However, I was looking for a new soundtrack to listen to while I read and came acrossFrank Herbert's DUNE - Original Soundtrack from the Sci-Fi Channel MiniSeries. So far, I absolutely love it. It has a wide, epic sweep to it. Some of the tracks are eerie and haunting guitar strings, while others have a Middle Eastern/desert vibe. It certainly adds a touch of exotic to the miniseries. It's almost impossible not to imagine the sandworms or nomadic ways of the Fremen while listening. It's also nice in that it's pretty relaxing to listen to, great for reading or right before you go to sleep."
5,"awesome, even if you're not a fan of DUNE","Graeme Revell's musical score of the Sci-Fi Channel's mini series, DUNE is a masterpiece, because Revell has the ability to add accent to each scene like no other, and really bring the film to life. Half of the success of the series is attributable to Revell and his compositions. Even if you're not a fan of the series, books, or movie from 1984, this soundtrack is a great piece of music that belongs in everyone's soundtrack collection. It obviously has that desert sun ""Sahara"" sound and mood to it, and I especially enjoyed track 10 (Reclaim Janis Water/ Worm Riding. Overall, there are 27 tracks, all of them good. I would really love to see a re-make of the original film, with a more generous budget. With today's digital technology, etc., the Dune franchise could really make a mark in sci-fi. We already know that the music would be awesome!!! 10/10"
5,a must buy,"a must for pressure canning, excellent quality, and well worth the priceshipped with leaky pressure gage but called the product company and got a swift replacement by just one simple phone call. a plus was they didn't require I send proof of receipt and the now fogged gage back before they would consider replacement..caution- this will not fit on the average electric stove but works quite well with propane burners, natural gas is not an option where we live and so I do not know if this would work on the standard gas stove, and it is HUGE and not exactly going to fit in the average kitchen cabinetI agree with less than ideal racks that come with product but was able to find inexpensive racks that fit well and work with pints and half pint jars well at the local hardware storethe fact that you can have this arrive the next day for a few dollars through amazon prime is quite amazing considering the size of the product-"
5,Cadillac of canners,"I just used this for the first time yesterday. It worked great! the racks kinda suck, but they are functional. I was only able to get 28 regular mouth pint jars in it, but I'm sure that is just because of the kind of jars I used. It was great being able to get everything done in one batch."
3,All-American 41 1/2 Quart Pressure Cooker,"I ordered the above pressure cooker which was received with the top handle damaged. The box was not damaged, so the pressure cooker was boxed from the company damaged."
2,Too Small!,"This works very well under extremely limited conditions. I found that in an entire 10 pound sack of standard Russett potatoes, not one would fit the machine without prior cutting to fit the machine.It is not only the potato length (3.5 inch max), but the height (2.25 inch max).Therefore the use of this is a marginal improvement in time to just getting out the chef's knife.Also, there can be considerable waste in cutting a potato to make 3.5 inch length fries if you are not willing to make 1.5 inch micro-fries with the leftovers."
3,Works very well but too small.,"This would be a five star review if the product was a little larger. Only fairly small potatoes (or precut) will fit in the unit and the cut fries are not as long as I'd like - especially when utilizing the shoestring grid. Make the interior a bit longer, wider and deeper and this is a five star. Function is fantastic."
1,Not very durable french fry cutter,I would not recommend this French Fry Cutter it is very hard to clean and is not very durable.
1,No stars for this one,"This worked great for a few weeks until the cutters started breaking. I would have given it four stars at first, but it can't take regular use. If you buy it, be sure to cut your potatoes small. Now I am back to hand cutting frys."
3,It's Okay,"I bought this item because I am tired of cutting potatoes for french fries by hand. It worked okay, but you cannot put long potatoes in it, you have to cut them down. The vacuum hold does not hold to well to my counter top. It's probably worth the money I spent realizing you get what you pay for. I have never bought a slicing machine before so I have nothing to compare it to. Keep in mind most of it is made out of plastic except for the handle and the blades. It works but if you are looking for quality this is not your machine."
3,"Reasonably built, but meant for light use","It works well. However, the notch/mechanism that keeps the blade in place sometimes allows the blade to slide down the assembly (the up and down movement is for you to change blades and make fries of different sizes). If you fail to notice that you will jam the red plunger into the off-placed blade, bending the blade ""squares."" I could not find a replacement blade so that misstep means I need to get a new cutter.I may get the same one because the ""pro"" models, besides being more expensive, seem to take a lot of space. Also the rubber thingy at the bottom of this cutter works quite well keeping it in place while you plunge."
5,French Fry Cutter,"The Norpro French fry cutter is the best one that I have ever used, it come's with two blades one for larger fries and a smaller one for small fires."
3,First half is awesome,"I LOVED the first half of this book, but had trouble finishing the second half. The first two chapters are GREAT at explaining the problems of identity and give lots of specific examples. Really thought-provoking first half of the book."
3,Worth the effort...,"This novel is moderately paced and does keep the reader's interest from waning. The sudden acceleration in the last 20 pages, and the twist those pages entail, certainly leaves one stunned (but not dis-appointed) in its suprise ending.I would not make a specif trip to a bookstore to buy her novels at their suggested retail prices; however if the store's Mystery Section had a sale on, I would be browsing to see if I can find another novel by her."
2,Anne Perry's Victorian mystery series is out of steam.,"I became entranced by Anne Perry when I read her first book, The Cater Street Hangman, and I have read just about all of them since, but I found this one long and tedious. The book had an intriguing crime, but it enfolded as a series of visits to upper-crust houses that did little to hold my interest or advance the plot. It seems to me that Anne Perry needs a new idea! This book was the selection for our mystery book discussion group, and none of the four of us who tried it liked it"
3,Strictly fair text,This text book isn't great but it isn't awful either. There are numerous typos and mistakes in the book. The author has a list of errata on his webpage that is 7 pages long and that is only a partial list. The explaination in the book is okay and the exercises are pretty good. If you have a choice I recommend using the text by Ross for learning the material or Karlin and Taylor for reference.
2,Dopers,"As a firm believer that everything mind can do depends on matter, I had great expectations for this book. I was disappointed that the author's research subjects were all serious dopers, and that he engaged in wild speculation about other dimensions of physical reality."
5,An Amazing Study,"A very interesting research on psychedelics, that enlightens the use of these mind alterings in near future for contacting non-human beings and sharing information with them."
2,"Mind Candy, but with an Aftertaste","This book is a bit ponderous, to say the least - that's because I was interested in his clients' experiences and not the pedantic research crap (like the fact that they had to flush the IVs with saline). Lots of stuff in here begs the question, ""Who Cares???"" A better editor would have done this book wonders. Regarding the research, I find it highly disconcerting that EVERY ONE of his guinea pigs were huge into drugs. There was not a single person who was not a regular user of some kind of drug, and what's more, had done acid or 'shrooms hundreds of times. What would have been far more compelling is if he had done the test on people with a high level of spirituality but didn't require chemically altered states to achieve it. The book was poorly written and the research was questionable."
1,Irrelevant mumbo-jumbo,"I was sorely disappointed by this tome. It consists of a very padded series of annecdotal trip reports, followed by some nebulous and unsubstantiated speculation on the role of DMT in the brain as a facilitator of birth and death. As a doctor, he appears to pay scant regard for the physical and mental health of his subjects. Ethical and regulatory approval for in-vivo research with psychedelic compounds is hard enough to get without crap like this. Stick to science, not this New-Age waffle. Waste of money. Do not buy it."
5,Intriguing and Resonating,"As an experiant of a spontaneous mystical trip, one-off, 35 years ago, this book explains what happened in a sound melding of science and spirit.I recommend this to anyone needing a jump start on transformational activities."
3,"Trip reports, scientific mystery, and great cover art.","The only conclusion of Strausman's work: If people are injected with large amounts of DMT, they will trip hard. A fun read, explores the history of psychedelics and how the brain is affected by such chemicals. Be prepared to read some very interesting trip reports. Strausman presents more theories than conclusive thought, in a subject that will remain as confusing as the meaning of life. This book WILL get you thinking though."
3,An important documentation of the effort,"I read this book hoping for an enjoyable journal of various DMT trips. The book does contain such tales to an extent. The majority of the book however documents, very well, the basis of the studies, the effort to get the research in place, and the authors commentary on past and future efforts. This is great, and it's good to know the author documented so well his efforts in what seems to be an issue many professionals dare not have their names embedded with. I respect greatly the authro for his work. I feel that this book was more valuable for the latter purpose rather than to entertain a reader on a psychedelic journey. There was no wild string of characters telling entertaining trip stories in this book."
3,An Interesting Look at Clinical Psychedelic Research,"Dr. Strassman's book is an interesting account of clinical research done with DMT - however it is mostly concerned with the logistical nightmare that is working with a Schedule I drug. A detailed account is given of the process that he went through in attempting to begin research with DMT, in giving it to volunteers, and their rendition of what the experience was like. If you are interested in hearing more personal accounts of DMT use, about more detailed science behind the presence of DMT in our own brains, or about the implications of psychedelic use in contemporary society, then you probably ought to look elsewhere."
2,Thin on Science,"This book is extremely thin on science. If you want a book filled with anecdotes, and a tolerance study on DMT, then this is just the book for you. If you were hoping for some science, even science on the fringe of what is possible, you will be extremely disappointed.Looking at the reviewers they put on the book cover, looking at the title, I just should have known what to expect, but somehow I still managed to convince myself there'd be some cool science in there. There simply isn't. Had I different expectations, I might have enjoyed the book more.The trip stories are very cool. The struggle to get a study are an interesting sidetrack to highlight the idiocy of the war on drugs. There's two stars. There's nothing else."
5,Absolutely fantastic. Best you'll find about DMT,"This is the best you'll find regarding DMT.This was a great book that covered very well the legal, medical, and technical parts of getting the research approved and the actual study in the first half of the book. The second half had the actual experiments with some fascinating personal accounts.I would personally reccomend this to both people who are interested in psychedelics as more than just an intoxicating good time, as well as people wishing to learn more about the ""near death"" phenomena."
3,Mixed,"I had hoped to read that people's lives were changed by the DMT experience. Dr. Strassman reported in the book that such was not the case.On the other hand, the experience that many participants reported sounded, in many cases, dramatic. Given the opportunity to experience DMT, I probably would."
5,interesting,Great read. Went rapidly because of the fascinating topic. Strassman needs to conduct more studies to answer some lingering questions....more validation.
4,Good Read,"This was a good read. I enjoyed it all the way through, but there were a few slow parts. It is very interesting to think of endogenous DMT, how we all have it in our bodies."
1,Dopers doing their thing,"After forcing myself to finish the book, I came to the realization that this author, so-called researcher and professional grant magnet, never arrived at anything concrete and did nothing more than supply goofy juice to his druggy friends. Thank God (the one I know) I saved my receipt. The book was returned and I demanded a refund which was given without much ado. Sincerely hope Strassman finds legitimate work but wait a minute... dealing prescribed pharmaceuticals is legit. He's a doctor!"
2,Shred this one.,"I like Jeff Daniels but this one left me wondering why I didn't rotate toilet sanitizer cakes instead of watching this and wondering why I didn't ? My own fault though, really how many writers suffering from writer block and wondering about their existence and insecurities do I really need to watch. Not the worst I've suffered through but kept us looking at each other wondering if it would ever pickup? It didn't."
2,Didn't Like It,I found it hard to stay focused on ...didn't flow and it was a little too silly for my taste..
1,disappointed in seattle,"i fell in love with emma stone after her piece in vogue and i'm using her as reference art for one my prime character and i've been staring at her face for months and months trying to see into it, and i realized, i really should watch her act, if i want to read her face. but i found this movie so incoherent and painful to watch that even though jeff daniels is in my favorite all time american movie made after the 1970s after altman after ... you see, it's a narrow range, but I'll fly away, so that is why i bought it, i trusted jeff daniels especially after that hbo thing. he's a little too heavy now for me. i wish he'd pick a little pixie in his performance but then no one will take it seriously i suppose. anyway, so i just found it insulting to jeff daniel and emma stone to waste them in this."
4,Paper man,This was a strange movie yet a good one about finding yourself and letting go of the characters you hang onto in your life in order to get there. It is shown in a comical way and also realized later in the movie with the girl. There were some lessons in this movie. I don't know if I really liked the actress that played the wife but again it could have been just the part I didn't care for that she portrayed in the movie.
3,"Mystery is servicable, with greed at the center.","Aird's ""Last Respects"" opens with a jaded fisherman finding a man's body in a river, and the Calleshire CID is called in to investigate, and they find that the man did not die of drowning, and that he had only freshwater algae on his body(he was found near a tidal basin). Sloan and Crosby investigate while we follow a dutiful young woman dealign with the recent death of a beloved aunt, and soon she discovers another body, which ties into the man in the river and surprisingly, another old murder. Good enough for me."
4,Last Respects by Catherine Aird,"Lovely little British mystery with lots of local 'colour'! Catherine Aird's series of books starring PC C.D. Sloan is a gem. In ""Last Respects"" Sloan is at first perplexed by an unidentified corpse who was found in water...but had been dead much longer than it appeared. With a full cast of characters drawn from the typical British countryside, it will take all Sloan's detecting skills, despite the 'aid' of his sidekick Crosby, and knowledge of tides, sheep-shearing, and municipal building projects to solve this case.If you're not familiar with British English, you may want to read this with access to an OED! But Aird does a great job of capturing English country life and character wrapped in clever little mysteries."
5,Remarkably insightful.,The biblical characters become so relevant with the interpretation of the very talented Katerina Katsarka Whitley. This book of dramatizations revitalized the Advent season and brought me to a new understanding of the Christ event. I loved reading the book. It also would provide good material for churches that include drama in their worship or Sunday School.
3,One of newest favorite bands,"Blood, Sweat, and Beers has enough ass kicking to go around for weeks. My favorite tracks off of this cd have to be ""Bridge Over Troubled Squatter"" , ""Little Julie Swastiska"", and ""Wholottamulatto"". If you were a fan of Inspecter 7 (members from inspecter 7 are in hub) you'll dig these guys. The cd consists of regggae, jazz, and punk. These boys stayed clear away from that ska pop sound. THANK GOODNESS. I give them a lotta respect. This scene has hope."
2,One scene makes my granddaughter very unhappy,"My 22-month-old granddaughter loves Dora, and she loves most of this video. The Humpty Dumpty scene either scares her or makes her really sad. After the scene where he falls, they show him in pieces with his four parts scattered all over the screen. She didn't react the first time she watched it. The second and third times she saw it, she started sobbing as it built up to the scene where he falls from the wall. I won't let her watch it again until she's a little older. I can't give anything that makes her cry like that a good rating. This is a baby who doesn't cry very often, and it was heartbreaking to watch her reaction."
4,Loved It!,"I enjoyed all the episodes. The first one was very entertaining, my daughter sang along to all of the rhymes, as Dora helped the lamb find Mary. Mr. Riddles was also entertaining and funny. I personally purchased this DVD for the Big River episode because my 2 year old and I like the song boots sings about how much he loves his boots."
5,In Depth Comprehension Activities,"If teaching comprehension is your ""thing"" you will love this detailed look at the components of comprehension. Irwin tackles each one of her aspects or dimensions of comprehension one by one and gives you many, MANY activities to improve comprehension in that area. If you have done everything you can think of to improve your students' comprehension and you are still not getting the results you want, try the methods in this book."
1,Why?,All I want is a bloody dictionary. How hard is it to find a free English dictionary?Riley T Campbell
2,Not too useful,This book does have a lot of info for its size. In my opinion it just has your typical memory items that you should already know from your pilot training. Items such as alcohol consumption and required VFR equipment should not have to be looked up by a current pilot. Overall the book has a ton of info in it but not really anything you should need while flying and if you were studying at home there are much better books for studying.
1,Too Basic,"As a pilot, I felt that this was a little too basic for real use. I looked through it once and never used it again. Most of the information a regular pilot should know off the top of his head and the other information is really not that useful. There are better application via the iPhone that cost less."
1,Product is great but never recieved the padded insert.,Pelican cases are awesome no question about that. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I ordered it with the padded divider for my camera and it never came. I am deploying n need to product my camera from damage. what good is it without my divider.
4,Do You Really Want To Know?,"My background: Science teacher, grown-up, gardener. As a science teacher I did want more, even more, scientific information from this book, although it gives a good general overview. And as a gardener it would have been terrific to hear about some more deterrents for this creature, but (alas!) it seems there aren't any! The slim volume describes the high survival capacity of this tiny predator (no enemies/not a picky eater or biter) and gives quite a few accounts of people who were bitten. These are good warnings (some people who aren't bothered by first bites later become quite allergic and can go into shock from subsequent attacks) and it's also nice to hear that people are getting bitten and can laugh it off.Very readable, good basic science descriptions on how they travel and feed, not much on eradication, mostly anectodal tales of being bitten."
2,Doesn't work after 1 1/2 yrs,I have also had the problem of this microwave breaking after only 1 1/2 yrs of use. Same problem I saw in another review - timer works but the microwave doesn't turn on. If we pushed in the handle and held it that worked for a couple days but now it won't work at all. I liked it before this happened but I think it's made pretty cheaply.
4,"So Far, So Good","After reading all the posts about the damage in shipping, I was hesitant to purchase this but I was one of the lucky ones and it arrived with no damage. The microwave works great and if there was one thing I would say, it is loud. However, the sensor part to reheat is the best! And, it makes perfect popcorn without setting a time. Overall, I am very pleased with this product."
3,"Dented, Noisy","Although very good looking with the constantly-needing cleaning brushed aluminum the unit arrived well-packed but dented in the upper rh corner of the case -- not worth the hassle of returning for this cosmetic flaw, but annoying as when I considered the purchase I was warned of this common denting problem and figured they would have solved it by now.The outer case vibrates loudly and annoyingly -- seems like it needs insulation between the case and the inner lining.Auto controls seem to overcook everything, but maybe we are just used to less hot food. In any case, we basically do what most do and just hit the start button for how ever many minutes and keep an eye on the food."
1,great microwave? no chance to find out... 2 strikes & you're out!,"the glass carousel plate comes lightly packaged on top of the main unit and came shattered! amazon did the right thing by overnighting a replacement unit... which had a huge dent in the stainless facade on the door. the packaging from sharp is clearly not sufficient for delivery.it may be a great product, but the problem is getting it to you intact. the risk is yours to take. good luck."
2,Mine died in 7 months,"I got this microwave as a gift. I had just used this for 7 months when one fine day it just died. I have contacted Sharp to see if they can fix it, but my 2 star rating stays till then. I was cooking rice, when it suddenly stopped working. The timer however just kept on decrementing, but nothing was happening. So I hope this is a word of caution, when deciding on one. It was great while it lasted."
5,Buy This Microwave Oven,I am very happy with this microwave. I use the sensor to heat everything. The food is hot and there is no guess work. Just push the sensor button and the start button and the food is heated. I have had other microwave ovens and by far this is the best. I love it. It is sleek and contemporary looking. It arrived a few days after I ordered it. I could not be happier with this purchase. Go ahead and buy this microwave oven.
2,"worked great for awhile, then quit.","this microwave worked great for over a year, then something happened to the door switch, and won't work anymore. would not recommend this unit."
3,"Best looking ""sensor"" microwave","Flat-out bought this microwave for its looks (brushed stainless steel and hidden keypad).I am not entirely impressed with its ""sensor""--the ""Reheat"" button way overcooks your food.However, I plan on contacting Sharp and learning if this is a defect or a limitation of ""Sensor"" cooking."
4,Love this microwave,Be careful if your living in an old building with very little electric available (15amp service)
3,AVERAGE,"Microwave product quality wise in terms of heating stuff, it is ok. The door opens to the left which is inconvenient at lest for me. The start button is so small. The door makes creaking sound within 10 days of use."
1,Cheese,"This unit has the lamest user interface imagined. In addition, it arrived with a dent in its cheesy front panel. Overpriced? Duh!Run away screaming."
1,Good Microwave? Didn't have the chance to find out,"Surely the microwave looks cool. That along with the size & power & price got me to purchase it. Unfortunately, the microwave arrived significantly damaged. I sent it in as an exchange, but the replacement microwave arrived in even worse condition. The packaging was, needless to say, terrible. Now I am forced to go shopping the old fashioned way..."
1,DOA,"The item was damaged (with a big dent) when I got it. Try to exchange it for a new one, but customer service said there was no replacement for this item so I returned the damaged item without a replacement. I don't know what the deal was because when I logged back on to the website, Amazon is still selling the item. I bought a new one from Circuit City and very happy with it. Still don't understand why Amazon did not want to replace the item even though they have it. The star I gave is for the shipping which goes to UPS and for Amazon for not replacing the item while still selling it."
5,High Tech Cooking,"This is an incredible microwave. I was a bit cynical at first, but having used it for over a year now, I've loved it and I can never go back to those smaller microwave ovens. The sensor cook feature is very neat and despite my initial hesitation, I've come to trust it to do the job, be it making rice or popping corn or just about anything imaginable, it works.Pros:* Big, powerful, and spacious.* Fast operation. Will cook in under half the time for a regular microwave oven. No more waiting.* Sensor cook. Love it.* Tons of features and cooking options.* Did I mention I get a lot of compliments from guests. The oven makes the kitchen look alive. Great look.Cons:* Slightly noisy but for a 1200 watt microwave oven, that can be expected.* The control panel looks complicated and needs some getting used to."
3,Ok reel not completely functional,"Purchased this several years ago-- will accommadate over 50 feet of hose but the reel is not heavy so when unwimding the reel will tip over quite easily when you want more hose. It hooks up quickly and without effort to the compressor, and does not become intangled with the feed from the reel to the compressor. ok product for my use of air for car tire, use with air powered tools and kids toys, but every day would be a pain with the easy tip over. Need to weight the base for stability."
3,Not exact fit,"This battery is marked just like original Canon NB-4L, however electrical current does not fit - it is 550 mAh as opposed to 760 mAh on the original."
3,A Djinn as tonic (for a world set on self-destruction),"Tom Holt once again endeavors to turn a literary tradition and a mythic system upside down and inside out, in order to take the reader on a wild ride and suggest the general folly of nuclear arms, romantic stereotypes, and self-destructive tendencies in all forms. In DJINN RUMMY, the literary tradition and mythic system is taken from The Arabian Nights (as told to Hollywood), with a Force 12 genie called ""Kiss"" stuck with the task of saving an ungrateful world while stumbling through the minefield of mortal romance. Though not, perhaps, among Holt's best works, DJINN RUMMY is still a worthy and entertaining afternoon's read."
1,$24 for 10 bar??!! A rip-off!,"Why are these Milka chocolate bars (from ""Indulgence"") so expensive? Here in Germany, one 3.5-oz. bar costs roughly US$1.oo (Euro 0.80) at my local grocery store. ""Indulgence"" is ripping us off!"
4,Given as gift,This smokeless ashtray was given as a gift to a friend who still has not kicked the habit. He can not smoke in the house and this item works fine on his enclosed porch. Works well and he likes it.
2,ashes,I didn't like it because the ashes get blown out all over the table by the fan. Also it is hard to get the ashtray part out to clean it.
2,DeBroth Smokeless Ashtray,"This smokeless ashtray took 4 ""C"" batteries that last only 2 days tops and compared to others it is very messy."
1,"Junk, not worth the money","I purchased this for my wife, who still smokes. It's made of cheap plastic, flimsey wiring, a extreamly noisy fan and a motor that eats batteries. The upper ashtray portion is difficult to remove (must pry it off) to access the battry and filter compartment. The inside portion, (battry & filter cavities, and motor & filters area) fill up with ashes, creating a mess to clean up. Unless the batteries are new, the cigerette is centered in the tray, smoke will curle up from it entering the room. A total waste of money."
2,Smokeless Ashtray,"This ashtray does work, if you keep you cigarette near it also it captures all of the smoke when the cigarette rests in the ashtray. However, it is irritatingly loud, I even tried headphones while using it, still could hear it. Also, it uses batteries quite quick, I probably smoke 10 cigarettes a day and in 2 weeks the fan was slowing enough that I needed to replace the batteries. I would think it might work well in a game area where there are multiple people talking and making noise and you aren't using it on daily basis to use the batteries up so fast."
4,Smokeless ashtray,Purchased for my son. He enjoys it very much. Reduces amount of smoke in his room.
4,A must have product.,The Norpro cherry pitter is a real time and work saver. I pick 5 to 10 gallons each year and the time saved with this product is a real bounty.
4,Wonderful!,"This season brought some of the sweetest cherries ever and, for that reason, I rushed to make all the jams, preserves and sundries I could before winter.The Norpro Deluxe Cherry Stoner/Pitter is reasonably priced, easy to clean and does its job. I've used this on both Bing and Rainier cherries--pitted perfectly with minimal loss of juice. My only complaint is that larger pieces do need to be pulled out individually (after pitting)--this is not a big deal to me, but may pose a problem for the serious baker and/or jammer. Also, the plastic construction is a bit cheap, but keep in mind this is one of the lower priced models out there.Overall a wonderful and extremely useful summer kitchen gadget for the cherry lover at heart!"
3,Norpro Deluxe Cherry Stoner with Clamp,It worked good enought but I'm not sure what I expected from it. We've used it alot of times but it wasn't easy.
4,Excellent instructors!,"Quality of instruction is great, but screen resolution (clarity) could be better. Many dance steps are included with practice music following each set of instructions. Split-screen presentation helps to identify exact steps in each routine."
5,Great for the Very Beginner!,This DVD was just perfect for us. Each dance step is clearly shown and described. There is a PIP for the steps. Each dance shows only the most basic steps so that beginners like us were not overwhelmed with tryng to learn the fancy stuff right away. We are eager to try the next DVD in the series as soon as we are grounded in the basics.
1,OK if you have never danced before,THis product is very basic and not a good tool if you have taken more than one class already.
3,Too Basic,Totally for beginners. I could have paid a dance instructor $10 more and learned more moves than what was shown.
2,not that easy to follow,My wife got this dance DVD for me since we have taken a couple dance classes at our local high school. Now with a small child it is harder to get out of the house. I was mostly interested in the swing dance section and found it hard to follow. I found the instructions where not basic enough.
2,Could have been better,"I bought this book with high hopes but was somewhat disappointed after reading it. I thought the idea was excellent, and the subject matter is most certainly worthy of a treatment in the popular science literature, but the actual execution was lacking. It was too technical, jargon was not properly introduced, and the author tried to cover too many topics too quickly. Anyway, that is just my opinion, but I would certainly encourage readers to buy the book and judge for themselves."
5,Love James Lee Burke!,"I love all of James Lee Burke's work, especially the Dave series. I will have to admit that I enjoy the older books (Neon Rain, A Morning For Flamingos, In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead) more than the newer books. The language in which James Lee Burke describes his characters and settings stays with you long after you finish reading, and you as the reader feel as if you know Dave, Clete, and all the other amazing characters personally. I would recommend these books to anyone who enjoys reading."
4,"Meet Dave Robicheaux, the cop who plays by his own rules...","I'm in the middle of reading all of the Dave Robicheaux'snovels (there's nine of them now), so it was a littleawkward reading ""The Neon Rain,"" the first Robicheaux book,having already read three of the others. I was far fromdisappointed. Burke creates the character nicely, givinghim a believable past and a strong personality. Robicheauxis so easy to like that, even when he makes his own rulesand goes hunting for bad guys with a sawed-off shotgun,you're thinking to yourself, ""Yeah, that's just what Iwould do..."""
2,"Beautifully written, but...","I love Burke's writing, his lyrical descriptions of place and atmosphere make you feel as if you're actually there, but I couldn't tell the bad guys from the good guys. It baffles me how anyone as prone to stupid forays into violence as Dave Robicheaux could be considered a sympathetic protagonist. I read this one and started the next in the series, Heaven's Prisoners, but Robicheaux seems to going down the same mindless, violent path in the second book. No matter how much I love the writing, it's hard to keep reading books about a character who I find to have absolutely no redeeming values. I think I'm done with this series."
3,Slow Start,"This is my first Robicheaux book and it was alright but not grabbing. My son recommended the series and claims it will get much better as the characters develop and if you read them in order. There are a lot of alcoholic demons, visions, stupors and AA meetings...kinda clouds the storyline at times, but the hero prevails and life goes on for ex-cop Dave Robicheaux."
3,"James Lee Burke, the neon rain","This is the first book I've read by Burke, it took me a little while to get into the story but once I was it was hard to put down.I will be getting more of the Dave Robicheaux series."
5,"Short book, but jam-packed story!","This is the first book in the James Lee Burke series with Detective Dave Robicheaux. Takes place in New Orleans, reads like a Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler story - old fashioned, hard-boiled detective story. Rich in characters and a sense of Louisiana. Doesn't take long to read, but I highly recommend it!!"
4,Pleasant Surprise,"Neon Rain was recommended to me by one of my own readers, and I am so glad I followed her advice. James Lee Burke clearly recognizes that the physical environment and the culture of a particular region are just as important a character as any walking, talking contributor to the plot. I look forward to the rest of the Robicheaux series!"
4,Burke,Always enjoy the Dave Robicheaux character. His empathy for others is overwhelming. He is the true Robin Hood of south Louisiana
5,The Next Best Thing to Living on Lake Ponchartrain,"I have never before seen Southern Louisiana captured in print with such realism as shown by James Lee Burke. The pages drip with Spanish moss, Creole history, and stifling humidity.Whether you say ""Neon Rain"" is the beginning of a first-rate detective series, or a bayou passion play, it really doesn't matter. You can't put the book down. When you read the last Dave Robicheaux tale, you start over. The bar has just been raised in this genre, and nothing else is quite good enough anymore."
2,don't stop with this one,"If this is the first book, of the Dave Robicheaux series you have read, then keep reading. This is the worst of the novels of this series. The others are better, oh a lot better! This one is over-the-top violent for no good reason. The rest of the series is Dave evolving into a more intelligent and clever detective, with great sensitivity to himself and humanity."
4,Not my usual genre,"I chose to read this book for several reasons. I loved the movie, In the Electric Mist and a friend recommended this series to me. After reading the reviews I had to try the first book in the series. I'm always looking for books and movies relating to Louisiana, and more specifically, the Cajun people. As a rule I am not particularly interested in crime stories. This, however, was a nice surprise. I liked the way the story unfolded. The events and characters were interesting and believable. The wonderful descriptions of places painted pictures so evocative of the steamy South Louisiana bayou country where I was born. I will be reading all books in this series."
3,Adventure story set in New Orleans,"Dave Robicheaux, New Orleans cop, gets involved with lowlives, including hefty mobster Didi Gee. Dave kills a few people and eventually has a confrontation with the Didi Gee crowd. It's not a bad adventure story, and the ending is one to be envious of."
2,Violent and stupid,"The story is unrelentingly violent, and the protagonist is unrelentingly stupid. Other reviewers say the series gets better, but this was bad enough that I'm not going to give it the chance. Sorry about that."
3,Inconsistent,"I ordered 2 of them and one turned out to be just plain pumice stone without foaming. Too much hassle to deal with a return, but will think twice before reordering."
1,A cytology book means pictures of high quality !!!,I decided to buy the book believing the quality of example pictures in the web page and I waited for buying this book three months. But I have disappointed very much after I bought this book. A cytology book means pictures of high quality. If you agree with this opinion you will not be able to find what you look for in this book. Because the pictures in this book are of poor quality. I believe that also the authors have not seen the pictures that placed in this book. If the authors had seen these pictures they would have not approved such pictures of poor quality. Besides the fact that the book is not sufficient in text too. I came back the book to amazon.com after one day I bought it.
2,Creepy as in distorted and raises the hairs not in a nice way,"Fuzzy in the insectoid sense, deliberately(?) Uses drum machine, yikes. Try City of Prague Philharmonic box for listenable treatments of many of our favorite genre themes+sound effects, much better value/song especially if imported and it's undistorted. ""The Science Fiction Album."""
4,Ricola says 8.5 calories for each drop,"This was my email reply from Ricola:""There are 17 calories per severing (2 drops per serving) in Ricola Sugar Free Lemon Mint Throat Drops""."
4,Great Book,"THis book will help most people understand the in's and out's of a computer. From everything from the FSB to Monitors, this book tells about them. With the plethora of different terms and jargon out there, this book will help the average reader learn what it is and how it works."
2,Useless Book,"More or less useless, anyone who knows how to use the internet should point themselves to his website. Stick to benchmarking and making pretty graphs because the articles are rather full of boring facts and useless information that is going to be outdated by the time you get to the next chapter"
1,Obvious,"Anyone can write a book like this. I thought i would learn more about hardware. Wrong, just go to his website and you'll learn just as much. I don't know why i even bought this book!"
5,My favorite shoe horn,"Bending over hurts my back, and I don't wear shoes in my house. That created a problem for me every time I was headed outside. So I ordered about 3 different long handled shoe horns to keep near doors where I leave my shoes and this teak one is my hands-down favorite. It is a beautifully crafted work of art that would look fine in anyone's umbrella stand or entry way. It is sturdy, the finish is silky smooth, and it could not work any better. I have bought them as gifts for other seniors and everyone loves them."
1,Skip this one,It wasn't as good as the plastic one I had. And it chipped. Too much money...just get the cheap plastic ones with a wide mouth. This one is too skinny.I think all the raves here were written by the company. It's just not that good.
1,Forget it!,This is the worst gadget I have ever seen. IF THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCTS THEY CAN COUNT ME OUT1
1,do not waste your money,"I bought this product to grate cheese. It produces a gummy mess of any cheese I have tried to grate. Do not waste your money on this product as it does not in anyway, shape or form, live up to its claims."
1,"Junk: Melted plactic, white smoke","I can't really tell you how well it works - ours ran for 15 seconds before it stopped with a ""clunk"" - it then started heating up (melting the plastic case) and spewing thick white smoke out of the adaptor recepticle - which was glowing red!We tossed this little fire hazzard in the driveway.Without a doubt, the absolute worst kitchen appliance I have ever owned."
1,A waste of money,"Black and Decker sure figured out a way to take your money and give you nothing in return with this thing! I think my dog could do a better job at grating cheese than this thing! If you barely push the cheese up against the blades, it stops working even on a full charge. What cheese it does grate clogs up the back. Total waste of time and money!"
1,terrible product! WHAT A RIP-OFF!!!,"I feel ashamed to even give this product 1 star. If you have less than 1 star, give it to this item. I love my other Gizmo,(can opener), so when this was advertised, I fell for it, hook line and sinker!!! I was stupid to buy it without doing what I always do, and that was to check customer reviews. I tried to grate cheese, and it gums up on the blade. It also hasn't any power. When you press the cheese against the blade, it practically stops. I've tried it twice. It then went in the 'recycling bin'. I wouldn't even donate it to my usual charity, as it would be a waste of money at .25 cents. Black and Decker should be ashamed of themselves!!!!!!!!"
4,Better for Zesting,"I got this at a garage sale, and was excited since I HATE zesting! My hands cramp up. Anywho, I don't use it for anything else. It does a great job...only complaint is that you have to use big pieces, otherwise the pieces tend to get sucked under the top arm (the piece that holds the grater in place). As far as getting the zest from under the grid...I just bang it a few times on the table...most of the zest falls out."
1,absolute junk,"I ordered the grater from OrangOnions it arrived defective and Orange onions would do absolutely nothing other than they emailed me to tell me to return it to the manufacturer which I am doing again somewhere and noone can find it in the shipping system is another gizmo supposedly, but not here going on a month now, B&D told me this was discontinued on the phone so beware ,, Black and Decker is not much help bad experience all around keep getting run around about this replacement nice idea bad design and construction"
2,grater,I tried to use this product and found it to be very awkward and too hard to use. I do not recommend it at all.
2,Not enough power,Very good idea but it isn't powerful enough to get though even cheddar cheese. Same with a potato. You want to make hash browns its better to grate them by hand.
1,Not worth the $,I received this grater as a Christmas gift and ended up being extremely frustrated and very disappointed. I am completely floored that this item was ever approved for sale to consumers. Very poor judgment on the part of Black and Decker.
3,Three Star Review,This item is useful for several items that I regularly grate. I do have to be very patient when attempting to grate cheese.
1,"Delivery prompt, disappointed with product",Good stuff 1st: Delivery was prompt. Bad stuff 2nd: Would not recommend this product. Did not realize cheese grater was mountable and rechargeable with the charge only lasting 15 minutes...was no faster than a hand grater. Sure wish someone would invent a decent electric cheese grater!
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought this to replace my broken salad shooter (primarily used to grate large amounts of cheese) because it costs less. I charged it the full time as the directions stated. The directions also advised not to put pressure on it because it would work better if the food was just lightly held against the grater. I tried it with cheddar cheese, and it didn't work at all. I then put just a little pressure on it. I got maybe a tablespoon of grated cheese (thinking the whole time it would be easier to do this by hand), and then it quit working. Plugging it in and recharging it made no difference. When I returned it to the store, the customer service person advised me not to get another one because so many had been returned. It's worth it to me to spend more and get a new salad shooter."
1,Save your money !,"I have to agree with the other reviews here. This grater is worthless. I received one for a Christmas gift and have tried every type of cheese on it - (Hard, soft, semi-soft, etc.) I thought I was using it incorrectly, but everyone I know that has one has said the same thing. For large quantities of cheese I suggest a food processor. Your regular box grater is far superior to this piece of rubbish."
1,"Skip this, no good",I got one for Christmas. It does not work. Soft cheese (Cheddar) simply wiggles up and down with the grater. Carrots take 3 times as long and more work than a hand grater. Mine is at the Salvation Army.
1,Lame,"I tried this product and was very unhappy with it. Even when fully charged, it didn't have enough power to grate my semi-soft cheddar cheese like my good old hand held grater. It made an awful squealing sound when you put a little too much pressure on it and it would only grate a very small amount (1 tsp.) after what seemed to be about 1 min. of grating. I took it back the very next day and am still using my 25 year old hand grater. It's too bad..it looks kinda cool otherwise."
1,Simply junk,Got it from LNT for 1/6th of the manufacturer suggested price and returned it the next day with the feeling this must be the worst kitchen product ever designed.
1,Complete waste of money,"This is the most disappointing kitchen purchase I have ever made. I assumed it would be a quality product because of the Black & Decker name, but it is the sorriest piece of junk I own. It will not grate ANYTHING. Do NOT waste your money!"
1,Pure Junk,"STOP!!!Do not waste your time and money on this thoroughly worthless,poorly designed, under-powered piece of pure junk.I can grate cheese faster using my fingernails."
1,Poor design and rechargeability,I was given this cheese grater as a gift. It was difficult to grip and use properly - the cheese kept moving with the moving blade. It did not hold its charge very long even when it was new. 1.5 years later it does not hold a charge long enough for one serving. I have started using it as an old fashioned grater with no power! I am getting a Delonghi since my daughter has had no problem with hers.
3,GG200 Gizmo Grater,Needs more work to grate all of the items we grate. Jams ifsome items are grated.
3,A different drummer,"I didn't buy my Gizmo to grate cheese. Our family has a favorite side dish made from finely grated carrots, coursely chopped walnuts, raisens, and mayo. I have grated carrots on box graters and flat ones, and even those torture thingys where you put a piece in the holder, squeeze tight, and turn the handle. I have left some skin and a bit of blood in every batch I've grated, until I got the Gizmo grater. True, it's not powerful. But it does carrots VERY nicely! I just lay it on its back, push the button with one hand, and rest the carrot end-on at the bottom of the grater. With the bar at the bottom to brace it, and a gentle pressure, the carrot is easily turned into grated delight with no loss of blood. I have had no problem cleaning it, although the white plastic tends to gain a golden color from the carrots.`"
1,Should be called: 'GIMICK CHEESE LESSOR',Okay here is a lesson in Physics. Let's look at Newton's Third Law of Motion: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.So if you are holding the GIMO in your left hand and the cheese in your right hand the FORCE it takes to hold the cheese against the moving grader is at lest as much as it takes to grad cheese with a regular grader. This thing makes grading cheese no easier. In fact as the GIZMO has more mass that a regular grader it takes more energy to get the job done.
1,Piece of Junk,"I asked for and got this several years ago for Christmas after seeing enticing ads on TV. It didn't work well at all with cheddar cheese (what we use most of), so I put it away, thinking I must be doing something wrong.Recently I dragged it out again. I reviewed the instructions, recharged it the requisite time, managed to get it put together, and tried again with cheddar cheese. Again, nothing. Would not grate - basically just produces a few random crumbs. I tried more pressure, but if you put a little pressure on it, it stops entirely.I suppose I will try to find SOMETHING it will grate before throwing it away. But I have to tell you, I have never bought a product before that absolutely did not do what it was supposedly made to do. It's a useless product, and I wonder how a company can get away with bilking people out of their money like this."
1,Just doesn't work,I have never seen a gimmick that delivers less. I grate cheese daily for use so I thought ... Maybe. Forget it! Soft cheese is literally impossible to grate because it cloggs the blades (any of them). I tried it as instructed (little pressure) and produced a clump of cheese 'zest' that required a kitchen knife to clear from the product. This product is particularly disappointing and is being returned today.
1,wow this sucks,i wish i saw the feedback before i bought this...this thing sucks you have to charge it 15hours just to get 23minutes of nothing.. it has no power and it just pushes the cheese it doesnt even grade it...please dont waste your money
2,Gizmo Grater,"Unfortunately, I didn't read any reviews on the Gizmo Grater. Had I read anything about it before trying it out, I would have not bought any. I bought a total of 6 graters to give as gifts. Two told me it is not good for soft cheeses. We use a lot of cheddar cheese for tacos. What a waste of money. It worked very good with parmesan cheese which is hard. That is why I gave it 2 stars. Other than that, thumbs down. Perhaps I should send the two back that I haven't given as presents."
1,Black & Decker Gizmo,"As far as the Gizmo is concerned, it is among the worst products I have ever purchased. It was placed in the trash."
2,Gizmo Grater,"I was very disappointed in the performace of the grater. It has little power and takes forever to grate a piece of cheese. I bought several and gave them for gifts, I am sorry to say my friends have had the same experience as well."
1,Not worth the trouble,"This gadget works (kind of), but simply isn't worth the effort. It will grate cheese, but it takes longer and seems a lot more trouble than using a regular grater.Mine is going to the deep dark recesses of a cabinet until I can remember to donate it to AmVets!"
1,TERRIBLE!,I wanted this for many months. I finally got it from my husband for Christmas and I wasn't impressed. Personally it's a piece of JUNK! I use the graters outside the case and shred it myself! One of the grater plates doesn't even work in the case..it rubs against the plastic...BAD!!! Very sorry we ever purchased this item.
1,Don't Buy It!,"A waste of money at any price! I bought this hoping that I could great large quantities of things like cheese for tacos, salads etc...and have been nothing but disappointed in it. The power is so weak that I eventually gave up and used it with the power off. Sadly, that helped me grate cheese twice as quickly. Great idea, bad execution. Black & Decker can certainly do better. Save your money by buying a box greater or a $5 microplane."
1,Great idea but they just didn't get it right.,"I bought this shredder most'ly to shread chedder cheese which I think alot of people would want it for. It doesn't work good at all on chedder. The cheese is constantly getting stuck behind the blade instead of just falling out the bottom, and this happens right away. You can't shread for more than 10 seconds before the cheese build's up. Then you have to stop and shake the unit until the cheese comes out, and it doesn't come out very easy. Something hard and dry like Romano comes out the bottom just fine but it takes too long. If you press the cheese too firmly against the blade it stops, and that's with a full charge. This product definitely needs improvements like a bigger barrrel for the cheese to fall through and more power. In the mean time get out your old hand shredded it works better and faster."
1,TERRIBLE,"What a waste of money, time and energy! It doesn't cut the cheese! I bought this product to reduce the strain and fatigue on my wrist, instead it added to it. It was extremely difficult to get it to shred the cheese and when it finally did, it clumped up inside the unit and not to mention the clean up."
1,Made in China crap,"Black and Decker management should be ashamed of themselves for this product. There is no way that any one of them could have possibly tested this made in China piece of crap. It makes a lot of noise and then binds up as soon as anything touches the blade. The only cheese that gets cut is the chunk you cut with a knife to put against the thing. I'd give this zero stars but, one is the lowest allowed."
1,Useless,"This is completely useless. It will grate only miniscule amounts of cheese, while getting clogged in the process. Any hand grater is far superior. If you need to grate large amounts of cheese forget about using this. Use a food processor. My cuisinart will grate in 2 or 3 seconds what this couldn't grate in five minutes. Someone at Black and Decker obviously didn't do their job of product testing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK,"ZERO STARS FOR THIS OVER PRICED PIECE OF JUNK! TO PUT IT SIMPLY, IT JUST DOESNT WORK AT ALL! IF YOU WERE THINKING OF BUYING THIS, DONT. JUST STICK WITH A HAND GRADER. EVEN AFTER FREEZING THE CHEESE ( AS RECOMMENDED)IT STILL WOULDNT WORK."
1,BAD BAD BAD,We eat alot of shredded cheese. In the commercials it shows it grades quick and easy. Classic case of false advertising. So we thought this was the ideal thing for us. Got it home. Charged it up. And nothing. It doesn't grade just kinda balls up the cheese. We tried every blade to make sure it wasn't that. But nothing. It would take forever to grade cheese just for a piece of cheese toast. What a waste of money. Black N decker did a BAD BAD BAD Job on this one. They really should have a recall on this product. Because it is the BIGGEST CONSUMER RIP-OFF EVER! I have NEVER rated a product. BUT this one is SOOOO BAD that I had to speak up. So Don't Waste Your MONEY.
1,I'd rather scrape my knuckles on a regular grater!,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I had high hopes for it because I love using grated cheese and this seemed like a great idea for a product. I charged it and then put a small piece of cheddar on it. If you push on the cheese at all it stops the machine. But if you don't push on it, it doesn't really grate the cheese. It made a few cheese crumbs but that's about it. On the plus side it is very easy to change grater attachments and it comes with a wall hook for storage. I never did install the hook though so I don't know how well it works.I didn't save the box so I can't return this and I can't bring myself to give it to someone else when I know it doesn't work. So this one is a complete waste!"
1,It should be illegal to call this thing a cheese grator,"I feel dumb for not checking out the reviews here first. I bought it for my wife as a spur of the moment gift while shopping for a can opener on her Christmas list. It had alot of wow factor Christmas morning but that's about it. I won't bother rehashing all of it's flaws; Neat Idea, Bad execution."
1,Not worth the money,"I got this for Christmas last year and it is the biggest piece of junk. It was loud, hard to clean and it would have been faster to grate by hand. I threw it away after the first time I used it because it was worthless."
1,the worst product,"I only got to use it once and it broke on the first carrot, what else do you need to know about this product. Don't waste even a penny on it!!!"
1,waste of money,I bought this item used and regretted it. Whatever you try to grate gets stuck at the blade. It is also slow - I can do it by hand way faster. No point to this gadget at all.
4,B & W Gizmo Cheese Grater,The company www.orangeonions.com was very helpful in getting the full use of this product. They helped me through e-mail. The product is very good for grating smaller quantities of fresh cheese directly on the dish or plate or salad.
2,Lite FM Folk is Not Goth,"Sorry, this CD is very far from truly being Goth (and I've been listening to Goth for a very long time). There is too much Lite FM sounding folk on it and other light moments. Sue Kenny is terrible and if she had continued on with BTFABG, they would have become one of the most horrible bands of all time (and definitely not considered Goth). Now don't get me wrong, I don't think it's bad because it's not Goth...I love many styles that are not Goth. I just don't like it because it basically isn't very good. ""Across A Thousand Blades"" (just about the only Goth track on here) is good, but even that track isn't as good as the updated version of the song they released as a single years later. Do yourself a favor, pick up ""This Lush Garden Within"", ""Remnants Of A Deeper Purity"" or ""The First Pain To Linger"" instead. Far superior releases."
4,i will sing,"This is an average recording all around, but it is worth it to hear Guy Penrod on ""I will sing of My Redeemer."""
5,My Very Favorite Gaither CD,"I'm one of those people who much prefer classical hymns to most modern Christian music. That's not to say that modern Christian songs cannot become hyms, as the Gaithers have demonstrated themselves. ""Because He Lives"" is one of my favorites. However it's not included on this CD, but this album contains so many wonderful hymns performed by so many wonderful singers, many of whom are now deceased, that it is a treasure. I have bought and misplaced several copies of this CD over the years, and when I lose it I always rush to re-order it because I'm just not able to live as happily without being able to hear Vestal Goodman sing ""Rock of Ages"" whenever I want to hear it. The great Guy Penrod performs on 4 different hymns! I've found it difficult to find recordings of Guy singing actual hymns, so it's another reason I prize this CD so highly."
1,What a piece of junk,This didn't last for 10 seconds under my desk - tilting the foot rest on the frame scrapes the paint off the frame! Also doesn't slide smooth - obviously - I hope to be able to send this back. There are better things out there for half the price.
3,A Spoilsport?,"Gosh, with all the acclaim for this CD, is something wrong with me? But do listen up. While happy with the selections, my ears hear our great Rolando (and I am not being ironic) too often singing off pitch, indeed sounding a bit tired, even rather wobbly (maybe the recording sessions were on off-days ...). In any case, I much prefer for a lot of this material what Jose Carreras recorded on the first disk of that threesome set he shares with - oh, rapture! - Teresa Berganza, brought out a few years ago by Brilliant Classics. By the way, one of my great musical treats this year was hearing RV in Paris in the Contes d'Hoffmann - Parisians simply and justifiably LOVED him! Fair enough?"
4,"Not quite the fiery gypsy, Villazon still wins me over","All the great Spanish opera stars have made zarzuela records--on the side, so to speak--that find enthusiastic audiences in the Latin world. This one from Rolando Villazon, filled with many tenor chestnuts from various composers, has caused the Amazon reviewer to propose marriage. It's certainly very enjoyable, with winning exuberance and style. Newcomers to zarzuela might be swept away. But if you know the classic recordings by Domingo, Krauss, and Carreras, just to mention the most recent tenors, Villazon operates at a lower wattage, and Domingo as conductor is a bit routine. The best singing for me was the quietist and most intimate.I'm not ready to call Villazon a superstar the way the Amazon reviewer does. His career is being spotlit right now, and this CD will help him, even though the voice could use more bloom and the expression a lot more variety. Enthusiastically recommended, but without rapture."
3,christmas Angels:A thousand voices in lincoln cathederal,I am happy with the above c.d and came in good condition and on time .from s.wallace
3,decent,"this isn't one of the best built pieces of equipment ever, but with gentel use (and some new ear buds) it will last for a couple of years. had some problems when i first got it and had to reformat and download the new firmware, but other wise fine. all and all, i say that it's pretty decent. has enough memory to keep me happy (i keep about 40 songs on it at one time and there is still plenty of space to move docs, ect.) would like to see a better fwd/back button next time."
2,Great if it was 1992,"I had this product, suprise it is still on the maket. It is bulk and poorly made for today's standard, would not pay more than $2 for this product"
1,Bait and switch,"I was originally searching for an assortment pack of tapes. The ad gave me the impression that I was getting 9 tapes for my selection. When all finally said and done I only received 1 tape for over 20 dollars not including shipping and tax. I have told dozen of people about how good amazon is, now I must tell hundred's about what to be careful when dealing with Amazon. I am very disappointed in sells ad ""3M 35 Electrical Tape 9-Pack (One of Each Color)"". I will send it back, but I lose my shipping paid."
2,OK,"THIS PRODUCT IS OK IF YOU DO NOT HAVE OILY HAIR, AS IT HAS CONDITIONER. FOR ME, WITH THE OILY HAIR, I DID NOT FEEL AS HAPPY AS I SHOULD WITH THE PRODUCT.THEY SAY ""DO NOT REUSE"" -- HA! I PUT MINE IN A PLASTIC BAG. THE SECOND TIME, I USED WARM WATER IN IT ONLY, AND JUST A TAD OF THE SHAMPOO STUFF WAS LEFT -- LOVED THE WAY IT WORKED. GOT 5 SHAMPOOS JOBS OUT OF 1 CAP.ALWAYS WASH AND RINSE THE INSIDE OF THE CAP GOOD BEFORE PUTTING IN PLASTIC BAG, AND USE WITHIN 2 TO 4 DAYS. ALSO, BEFORE USING, REFRESH THE CAP WITH SHAMPOO, AND ALOT OF WATER.LINDA"
2,Not what I hoped for,"Purchased this DVD as I had seen the movie many years ago, unfortunately the colours were all faded which was disappointing. This is my favourite G&S Operetta and after seeing the original movie and the D'Oly Carte production here in Melbourne the lack of colour was a shame the music and performances are still very good so if you like G&S you may want to find a copy that is more up to date."
4,The Mikado,"this is a wonderful and entertaining version of the classic Gilbert and Sullivan ""The Mikado"". Well worth the price of the DVD."
1,hearing problem,"Is there a closed captioned version of Gilbert and Sullivan's works. My hearing has deteriorated with age and I would love to see & hear a good performance, especially of ""The Mikado""."
2,How can people like this DVD?,"Gilbert & Sullivan musicals are enjoyable. The Mikado music is wonderful. BUT, the technical aspects of this DVD are terrible! If I hear and see one more fan being opened and snapped shut I think I will scream. And while I am listening for the snapping I won't be bothered by the dialogue and lyrics because I can't hear them well enough to tell what they are saying. There is a definite mushiness about the audio that makes it extremely difficult to understand anything. The audio is not well synced with the video. This is especially noticeable in close-ups. The graininess of the picture makes me think that this DVD was made from a copy of the original that was photocopied 27 times before I got it."
4,When bad days turn good,I liked the book because it was funny and it teaches kids that bad days can be really good days.
3,Handle With Care,"When the package arrived, it looked as if traffic ran it over various amounts of times. Which would explain all the dents, marks, and scratches all over the swords. But they weren't too bad, you can't notice them from afar. Overall, I was okay with the swords. It's great for what it's meant to be, which is display. Had pretty fast shipment, just wished they took better care of it on the way here =\"
3,Damaged Swords due to Poor Packaging,"My son loves the set, but was very disappointed due to pretty severe damage on the handle. I noted reviews concerning damage due to poor packaging prior to my purchase, but took a chance. Will hopefully be able to exchange without too much hassle."
3,Not what I'd hoped....,Less about dancing and too much about Pablo Ziegler. Best appreciated if you like jazz and the music of Astor Piazolla. I was looking for dance and there are a couple of excellant numbers here but most are too staged and jazzed up. The director spends too much time showing us the sultry and not enough time on full body views of the dancers.
4,The Passion of Tango,"This is an excellent study of Tango... for beginners to the more advanced. Hector Elizondo does an excellent job of narrating this piece. This is Argentinean Tango, and it is good. Great form and dancing, and you feel the music, and the passion. Highly recommended!"
5,remembering what is important,"I thorougly enjoyed reading the novel, The Journey Home by Marigold Fields. I wanted to discover the suspense held in the very first chapter and I might add, the synopsis made me curious! Well, Ms. Fields definitely delivers! Her writing style and her familiarity with family relationships and personal kinships wrapped me into her plot. She knows ""what is important"" in life! At a time when everyone is reaching for ""self-help"" books and listening to Oprah and Dr. Phil, all everyone has to do is grab this book which is a very easy and comfortable read and the answers to many of life's problems are revealed. It is a fictional story with a nonfictional lesson. I could relate and I am willing to bet many people may say the same thing after reading this book."
2,Black Tape For a Blue Girl - This Lush Garden Within,"This release is just too quiet, seriously, there was nothing behind this recording. Too many lulls in music, too much silence. This CD put me to sleep, which isn't a good thing when I'm driving. From what I could hear the music was beautiful, but there were too many dead spots, much of time there was nothing of significance going on. I found this release to be choppy and aggravating, switching from an ethereal soundscape to complete nothingness. Boring, uninspired, pointless (for the most part), strictly for the fans."
5,The BEST of Black Tape for a Blue Girl,"This album is by far Black Tape's best, the range of which hasn't been reproduced to the same quality on any of their other releases. After being at least slightly disappointed in 'As One Aflame' I can always return to this highly emotional and complex album."
3,Hat ?,Is indeed a quality made item. Would be nice it they where folded square so the look ok when worn rather than making me look off set... But yeah good interaction good speed.
5,A Man of Spirit,Nakai Is a Man of Spirit and this is reflected in all his music. The Jugaheart review is an unwarranted one fill with a lack of spiritual depth and insight hence the name jugaheart means one that plays tricks or has an insincere heart. The Universe will give you exactly what you put out. Carlos Nakai on the other hand needs no one to defend him because Spirit can do that. I Thank God for him! His music connects me to my Native American Heratage and I feel a deep connection to who I really am. Thank you Carlos Nakai because many look at my features but they don't understand the spirit within me My Native American features stand out but the spirit within me stands out even more.
1,Crap made in Portugal with a hefty replacement part and labor cost that will defeat any possible savings!,"This is a revised review. I initially purchased this product at the end of 2006. I have learned the hard way that Bosch will more than make up for any possible (and alleged) savings when their equipment breaks down! I have just spent close to $600, between parts and service to fix a stupid plastic component of the machine. Their warranty was only for two years. Also, you will spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to reach a live person at customer support. I am totally disappointed and will never recommend anything this company has to offer anymore."
2,Not at all about the perfect society,"I got this book because of all the hype surrounding it, especially when something carries the title ""Utopian society"". Yet, after reading it I find that Utopia itself was never meant to be the ""perfect"" society, but rather a ""different"" society. In fact, Utopia is far from perfect, and people need to quit thinking that it is. As a STORY, Utopia is not all that exciting. Animal Farm is a much better book in my opinion."
3,I thought this was supposed to be a new book,"If that book was NEW, then every book I have read in the last 5 yrs is new, or is that what you call a book that has been read before repackaged and shipped"
1,not at all as described,i was very dissappointed in this product if you look at package was supposed to be box set with map and dm screen showed up as book edition paid way too much for crappy substitution very unhappy with product
2,See ya!,"Since it's inception, X-Treme X-Men has had it's share of up's and down's. Even though it's been scripted by legendary X-Men scribe Chris Claremont, this title really showed his flaws as a writer, and the flaws within the X-Men mythos that Claremont himself is and was responsible for to begin with. Prisoner of Fire, the final collected arc of the series, finds Storm, Shadowcat, Gambit, Rogue, Bishop, Sage, and the rest of the crew on the trail of a genericly written villain that naturally leaves the door open for another encounter. Igor Kordey's art looks more improved than what we have seen on his various stints on New X-Men, but it doesn't have long to impress since this TPB comes to an end rather quickly. Since X-Treme X-Men has come to an end, Claremont has returned to writing Uncanny X-Men and is also the scribe of the newly launched Excalibur book, both of which are currently faring better than almost anything to be found in the entire X-Treme X-Men series."
4,Great!,"I was introduced to this line in a spa and have loved it ever since! My skin is super sensitive and changes all the time. This is the perfect day and night moisturizer. Great under make-up and good at night time for those of us trying to keep costs down. When my skin is really hyper, I also use a soothing serum underneath it."
5,Good etheral music,"Black tapes music i basicaly ambiental synthbackgrounds together with accoustik instruments and beautifull male and female singing. Always emotional and melancholic. But this is one of black tapes happier albums , and it has more of an 80's feeling too it. It's wery good slow beautiful music , higly recomended....thoug it should not be classified as Goth ! Black tape is Etheral!"
5,Beautiful and haunting,"I've been listening to Black Tape for a long time and as far as their first 3 albums go from the late 80s, ""Mesmerized"" is my favorite. Personally, I'm not big on 80s music at all and yes this one does have a bit of an 80s feel to it but, it's truly amazing none the less! Beautiful, dark, and ethereal. Sam's electronic sounds are very mesmerizing in this album as well. Worth every penny in my opinion."
2,Eh...,"Not so fantastic. There are a couple of good tracks like ""Sawdust Scatter"" which is actually one of the rare moments that BTFABG actually ""rock out"" a little, but otherwise Mesmerized is nothing special."
3,Kavious - A Real Underground Southern Rapper,"I think this album is kind of tight with a couple of tracks. The tracks I like the most out of this album are: (1) Spit On Em (feat. Ms. Krazy & Marco), (2) Hard Living (feat. Andewoo & Heylow), (3) Eh Nah, (4) In The Yo (feat. Killer Mike) and (5) Outro.Kavious is a rappper who is on a different level to a different style, comparing to the rappers as of today. I like this album because it is something different and underground which fans shouldn't sleep on this one. This CD is a must-have for all of the fans who is into southern rap."
5,Compelling read of a dark character,"Was intrested in this particular man because of his connection to our town of Alvarado, Texas. I remember very well the horor we felt when one of our fellow students was needlessly and cruelly murdered by Kenneth McDuff. We all realized at that time that there was a darker side of life from what we had known in our small quite town. This book is a chilling account of this man distorted mind."
1,Not so compelling,"Being a true crime buff and former resident of Texas, I was really excited to read this book... When I finally recieved it and began to read it, I was truly disappointed. It is very poorly written and hard to follow. I normally read a book in 1 to 2 days and it has taken me 5 days to read this one. I do not recommend wasting time or money on this particular book."
2,Poorly-written,"I really don't understand the positive reviews of this book. It is poorly-written and amateurish, and the story-telling is not at all compelling. I would read 20-page blocks of this book and then forget about it for a month. The description of people and events is extremely thin, and it's obvious that little research was put into it. That might be forgivable if, as I said, the writing wasn't of such low quality. Compare this to a classic true-crime book like The Executioner's Song, and it's like a clinic for whoever wrote this book."
1,Bulbs blow at less than 500 hours,"I have been a proud owner of this projector for a short while over a year. I love the picture this projector creates. Bright, smooth images and the HD is awesome. However, there is a manufacturer's defect in the bulb. My bulb, after only putting 470 hours onto it, exploded last night. I'm finding case after case of this happening to people with this projector. I can only hope panasonic will do the right thing and replace my bulb at no cost. I'm sad to say that I probably won't buy another panasonic projector (and, from the looks of things, I'm going to be back in the marker REAL soon). I think I may go back to sharp, who made my original projector which I loved.beware of this! you'll be very sad when your bulb prematurely goes ""POP""."
1,Defective Blue LCD Panel/Polarizer,"Don't buy this uless you want a disposable projector. Worked GREAT for a while, then a blue blob started on the right side of the screen and within 3 months took over the whole screen and it is now useless. Cheaper to replace than to repair the bad panel or polarizer...will go with Sanyo this time"
5,The best black tape cd !,"In my opinion this is Balck Tapes best cd. It is not as dark as some of the other cds, and not as diverse as the earlier ones. It is slow relaxing and beautufull from the begining to the end.And Julianna towns is the best of the female singers black tape ever had."
1,Boring tape for a boring girl,"""the rope"" was the first record by BTFBG. It's pretty good, nice and relaxing. However, this record is just terrible, it's not even relaxing in an interesting way, it's just sleepy background music. The ""skin flute"" reference was an obscene joke that guy made, didn't you get it?"
5,The #1 Tape for Sasami and Tsunami Lovers!,"This is probably the best dubbed tape for Sasami and Tsunami Lovers! On the Second Episode of this tape, ""Episode #9: Sasami and Tsunami,"" it explains the deep connection between the merry, child, Sasami, and her future counter-part, Tsunami. Aside from being funy it is a touching tale that takes place 700 years ago on the distant planet of Jurai. And the first episode on this tape ""Episode #8: Hello Baby!"" is very funny! -for those die-hard comedy fans!"
5,"The best Thanatos album, a must for your collection","This album just keeps growing and growing on you. It might take you a few listens to get into the album, but give it a chance. The ambient syns in the background of most songs by the ""Great One"" SR are enchanting and PO's guitar work and voice are ones not to be missed. Easily, my favorite out of the Thanatos albums. Even some of the songs ""cheesy"" lyrics will get to you after a while. Contains the best cover version of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" that I have heard. Another fine release from Projekt.(as usual)"
4,"Tough, practical questions!","I'm in my last year of nursing school and have found this book to be helpful when studying for exams. The questions are tough and give you 4 good answers but really make you think about what is the BEST answer. It also has a lot of questions regarding delegation and prioritization, which friends have told me they've been asked on NCLEX and were unprepared for. The CD is also helpful to show you what the NCLEX CAT format will look like."
4,Impressive First Effort,"""The Lutheran"" is a Louis L'Amour Western, in a sense, garbed in Ernest Hemingway prose, and a terrific first novel by Sullivan.It's a Western in the sense that Sullivan uses the austerity of the Old West to mostly help define his characters, and his unique prose style fleshes them out. The title character is unforgettable, the imagery is stark, the structure is flawless, and the climax is handled deftly and surprisingly.It's not a breezy/easy read; Sullivan makes you earn the satisfying conclusion, and forces you to think about the nameless forces that shape each of us.I can give you two hints to ensure full enjoyment of Jack Britton Sullivan: (1) read ""The Lutheran"" twice, as I did, and (2) buy his next book, as I will! Jack Britton Sullivan, soon, will be a literary force to be reckoned with."
3,Blending modes cook book,"More for the advanced beginner, I have learned a lot about blending modes from this but I learned my Scott Kelby basics first."
4,Great Book,"I guess it depends on how you learn. This book has recipes for various looks using Photoshop's Blending Modes. The examples generally include several different kinds of photos. The result is that you get to see what happens to photos of things, people, landscapes, etc. using the same or similar recipes. The author also tells you when he did things a little differently for one or two kinds of photos, and why.I've seen a lot of this stuff before, but found that I learned a lot from how this book is laid out. It should also make it a lot easier to find, and use, a specific technique for a specific problem.Because I am a digital scrapbooker, I might find all of this a lot more useful than some other people who use Photoshop. I'm not only manipulating photos when I scrapbook, I am also making and manipulating digital papers and elements. These techniques would be extremely useful for scrapbooking."
4,"Photoshop, CS2, blending","This text is very well done and introduces the average reader to numerous blending modes that he/she might not have known eisted. The cookbook design makes following the procedures to gain specific effects easier to understand. While most people will never use all of the methods described, he/she is exposed to the techniques to employ. And that makes for better understanding of the blending process within Photoshop. My nly real complaint is that the typeface used makes it difficult to read. It should be darker and more prominent. The publisher needs to be aware that books are not always used in perfect light."
1,You'll Need a Magnifying Glass,"I was looking forward to reading this book but unfortunately the publishers of the book decided to use extremely thin typeface (or font or whatever you call it) on a beige background. So, you actually cannot read it without a magnifying glass.So rather than reading and being able to comprehend some complex techniques, I find myself going back to the beginning of a paragraph time and time again just to verify what the words are.Frustrating because I haven't made it through the first chapter yet and I flipped through the book and the type is the same throughout."
2,"Excellent musicianship, marred by attempt to sound contemporary.","I originally owned this title on vinyl as a child many, many years ago, and I loved it. Listening to it now on CD, it sounds hokey. In fact, it is downright annoying.The musicianship is excellent, the arrangements flawless. Sadly, the tracks suffer from the addition of a click track, an effect added in an attempt to make the music sound modern and contemporary. Sadly, what may have been interesting in the early 1980s sounds positively hideous today.As an early example of electronic percussion, this particular click track (it actually is meant to sound like clapping) is not nuanced at all, and would sound far more in place with a New Wave title.And every track on this album has this annoying click track! The same effect on every tune.If this material were to ever be remastered, even if they simply removed the effect and did nothing else, the album would rate a 5 in my book."
1,Defective CD,"I received this CD ""Hooked on Swing"" promptly after ordering, but when I try to play it, my CD player will not load it. The other two CDs in my order play correctly."
4,Learning from the Past,There was a great deal to learn from a story that is over 100 years old. I was unfamiliar with the story of racism at the military academy and this thoroughly researched book provides a great deal of context and thought provoking observations that are useful today.The author is challenged with finding authoritative resources long after the trail has gone cold but does a great deal of first-hand reporting unearthing historic letters and photos.I understand there will be followups to this edition which should be a welcome addition to what appears to be a rather small bibliography on the subject.
3,Moments for the Heart,I am very happy with Disc Number 1 which was the reason I brought the CD but Disc 2 is scratched and can't be played in my CD player. I guess with it being second hand there maybe some problems!!
1,Avoid at all costs,"Not playful, not energetic, nor creative , unlike what they've done before. Looks like something they quickly threw together to make a fast buck. I love this band, however, only when they're at their best...and this is completely the opposite! Ced Gee is horrible on the mic and makes Lil Wayne look like a genius. Buy a Kool Keith solo album instead!They definitely wasted the opportunity to show the new hiphop fans why they've earned ""legend"" status."
3,Could have been better or worse,"This is a just okay reunion album for the legendary Ultramags. It could have been much better, when you take ""Critical Beatdown"", ""Funk Your Head Up"", ""Four Horseman"" etc in to account. It also could have been much worse. Ced Gee sounds horrible on the mic. Keith sounds good on most tracks, but overall, the magic just isn't there on alot of the tracks. There are about 6 real bangers on here, but for Ultramagnetic, every song should be dope. I think it would have been better if TR and Moe Love had produced more tracks and if Ced had only rapped on a couple of tracks."
5,Players rule!!!,"I liked this movie because it was about a player. That makes it cool. It was about the guy I like right now, and the girl who I wish was me."
5,Why won't you go out with me?,"Robert downey plays a smooth talikng problem solver who tries to pick up a good-two-shoes teacher who is also a really good luck charm when it comes to playing casinos whose father is in enormous debt who is being bailed out by robert while still trying to pick up molly while being pursued by a scary hitman harvey keitel while being funny the whole time.It's a good movie, people. Buy it, own it, love it.Enjoy!"
2,Not the best movie,I do not think it was a very good movie and the video was bad ..needed to be re masted ..but I just did not think it was a movie I wanted to see more then 1 time
1,too confused.It does not have a crhonologial order.,"Very very confusing. Is does not have a chronological order, so it is confusing reading it. Furthermore, for people who were not raised with english as mother language, it is hard to make it out."
2,Not very informative,"Churchill is one of the most amazing figures of the last century - yet with all of his background to pick from, this book doesn't present much of him.This is basically the author sort of randomly meandering around through Churchill's life and then stating his opinion of certain decisions Churchill made. And it's done without providing much of a framework for the various events he discusses. I've read a lot about Churchill and yet I was lost at times trying to figure out where/what/when on some of the events.There is a lot better out there (William Manchester's 2 volumes for example)."
3,Geoffrey Best on Winston Churchill,"I bought G Best's book because of its apparently good review in John Lukacs book on WSC.It probably appeals to readers who want a general read about WSC, but in the sense that it appears to be written from existing book sources, it does not seem to offer any new insights - at least it did not for me."
5,Excellent read on the Man of the 20th Century,A very readable book that provides balanced and insightful coverage of the whole of Churchill's life. I would highly recommend this book either to those who have not previously read much about Churchill or equally to those who have read other Churchill biographies or war histories and wish to take a fresh look. Of particular value is the way that the author take the occasional opportunity to dispel certain myths and revisionist ideas about Churchill.
5,"A singer, a guitar, and a great pick of songs...","OK, it's simple. Mr. Carthy, his voice, and guitar. A little violin on four songs, harmonica on one. Performed and recorded directly, plainly, clearly. Beautiful and strong. Just listen.And a solid selection of songs- terrific trad stuff, strong performances, and find mixed in some unexpected material. The Bee Gees? Heartbreak Hotel? Hong Kong Blues? Cool. And a great version of The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol. All delivered in a way that makes the whole recording feel a single piece.Quite nice. I like this record"
5,Brilliant and comprehensive,"If you are looking for a very comprehensive book on running a graphic design company, this is for you. The book goes into details on everything from pricing to hiring, insurance, taxes, incorporation, dealing with clients, vendors and just about everything in between. It is quite a hefty book and it will take a while to get through it, but from my experience that is mostly because I keep stopping to take notes on things I want to remember.While I find some of the other design business books I have read (and reviewed) go into more depth in specific areas, this book covers quite a range of content and manages to still go into farily great detail.I checked this book out from the library and kept it until I started racking up the fines... then I came here and bought it."
2,For large firms not small freelancers,"This is not for me. It is pretty good for interesting reading, but not made for freelancers like me."
1,Horrible service,I ordered these Tic Tacs on August 8th and I have yet to receive them or hear anything back from the merchant. I will never order from them again.
4,good tool,i bought this as a birthday present for my dad who likes to tool around in the kitchen. he said though it would have been better for larger avocados it worked fine on mediums sized ones. a decent little tool.
1,Enemy mine,"This is the tool to recommend to your enemies, not your friends. This was a total waste of money. To put it simply it doesn't work. It will destroy your avocado in a matter on seconds."
1,one trick pony doesn't always do the trick,"This was a gift that was going to go in the white elephant pile, but after sitting in a closet for a year, I took off the packaging and decided to give it a try. The very first avocado I planned to use it on was smaller than the implement and so it simply could not be used. I tossed it back in the drawer and grabbed my handy paring knife - which was quick and convenient to find and perfectly acceptable. I have never used it again."
1,Buy this if you want to feel like a total RETARD.,"This is the worst kitchen gadget I have ever used. I thought this would be really cool, but I was wrong. I used a wire version once and liked it, and I felt like a total retard for wasting my money on this plastic POS. This will mash your avocados instead of slice them, then you'll work twice as hard trying to clean the darned thing. Just use a knife, or if you must have a gadget try the wire one. I thought about giving this away or putting it in the box destined for charity, then decided to throw it in the garbage instead in order to save somebody else from having a frustrating time using it."
1,"No, no, no! Buy the wire one instead!","I bought one of these as a replacement for a wire avocado slicer. What a mistaker. It deos not work well with smaller Hass avocados, and at best, mangles the fruit. Stick with the wire version. I would give this a ""0"" if I could"
2,can't use it,"The concept sounds great--flexible plastic--but I still can't get mine to work! Seems stainless steel prongs, long ones, would work best."
3,"Not bad, but have used better version/",The product is better than using a spoon but not the best on the market at the moment.
5,enthralling. . .,"...pain that is beautiful..sadness that is perfected in aural splendor..compelling lyrics that stir deep in one's soul..this is what to expect by listening to ""the rope"" by the ever majestic black tape for a blue girl..this is definitely late night music as all of their cd's are...if you do not own this cd as of yet..purchase it..light a few candles..in a quiet atmosphere...preferably, during the night hours..and let the music immerse you....it is a journey unlike any other..that I can assure you."
2,What happened?,"I love U.N.L.V. as a group, I have all their old CDs, upto Trendsetters, I love them all, Trendsetters was great despite the fact they werent at full power, missing Yellaboy (R.I.P.) ofcourse, but this last one... What happened guys? It just isnt good at all... I am really dissapointed with it... I only liked a few songs such as Torcha, Act Like You Know, and Rat-Da-Tat, the rest are just bad... Sorry guys... Hope you come back a lil stronger next time..."
1,Customer service.,The order was due over two weeks ago. Where is it? You ruined part of Christmas for me.
5,Perfect for the man that doesnt have enough pockets!,"I bought this for my Boyfriend because he was always sticking his stuff in my bag to hold, then he would forget where they where. He puts his phone, wallet, sunglasses, coupons, reusable grocery bags and pens and note pad (for all his nerdy ideas). He likes that it looks like a bag and not a purse."
3,Looks good but.....,"It's a bit small, I couldn't fit what I needed into it. For odds and ends, it's ok. You get what you pay for."
5,Godson loves it.,"I bought this bag for my godson and it fits all the items he normally stuffs in his pockets - cell phone, wallet, pens and now he added a little book of quotes. It might be small for some but it's just the right size for him."
4,Nice and cheap,"I got this bag for my husband who goes to aikido classes. He likes to wear his uniform and this bag is small enough for him to take everything he needs to the class. The bag holds a wallet, a bunch of keys and a cell with a little extra room for maybe glassess. Overall my husband is very pleased with this bag."
3,Smaller than appears,"I purchased the organizer for my husband. He uses it to carry his glasses, phone and a few small personal items. It serves its purpose but it is smaller than he would have liked. The workmanship is poorer than expected."
4,Perfect,"It is perfect to carry my glock 26 in a pocket holster. I use it in the summer to carry my handgun, extra magazines and sunblock with a high intensity flash light. It needs a shoulder pad but they're relatively easy to obtain."
2,Small,"I thought it would be a bit larger, but I can make due with it. They mentioned it would be small."
4,Nice manly organization tool,"This product is sort of like a CD case that is big enough to hold some basic items. I keep a pen, small moleskine notebook, cell phone, keys, pocket knife, and some other basic tools... holds it allPros* Quality product* Plenty of pockets (2 main compartments, 1 small)* Stiching good* Exactly as advertisedCons* Not YYK zippers* cell phone holder too small for my Samsung Galaxy Note ( Very large phone - 6"" tall) should work for normal phonesThe reason I gave this 4 stars to this was I did not expect it to hold my cell phone, but is a nice way to keep organized."
3,its too small,I did not think the bag was this small. should read description of item next time. I had to purchase another bag for my trip.
1,"Looks good but GARBAGE, GARBAGE, GARBAGE...","BUYERS BEWARE... this product is made with the cheapest materials possible.I really like the looks of this bag, and I love how it has a lot of little pockets, but the hardware is the lowest end garbage you can buy. The metal clips on the shoulder-straps broke on THE FIRST DAY I WORE IT!!"
2,Cheap hardware.,"This bag seemed perfect for me - small, black, plenty of compartments - but the hardware just sucks. The very first time I opened it the zipper pull came off. Over the next three months little things kept on breaking one piece at a time. It's now in two pieces; a bag and a strap with no way to connect to each other."
1,I would give zero stars if I could,"This album is horrible, worst album ever. Like previous reviewer said, what history?"
3,An Interesting Topic,"I initially read this book in high school will researching a paper on the relationship between Wagner and Nietzsche. Surprisingly, our school library had a copy. At the time, it really opened my eyes to the occultic beliefs of the National Socialists.I recently purchased the book to read again. It was, and is, a difficult book to read. His writing style is unique, to say the least. The book does have a lot to offer, but I am suspect of some of the conclusions drawn. Without a complete, detailed bibliography to analyze, it can only be viewed as an introduction to the topic."
3,Video doesn't cut it,"I just got this camera and didn't have much time to play with it so I can't write a detailed review, but I thought it warranted noting about the video portion of the camera because I didn't see it in any of the other raving reviews. When you zoom while videoing you lose all sound. This stinks. I depend on my camera for all videoing of my kids. I don't have a camcorder. I take video of my kid's school performances constantly, most of which involve singing and music. So, when I noticed this issue with the video sound I immediately packed it up and am returning it. I can't have the sound just cutting in and out when I'm zooming for a close-up. Also, the zoom is only 5x. I currently have a Canon S2 IS which blows this camera away with 12x zoom. The only reason I wanted a new camera is because the Canon is so big and bulky. I wanted to have a camera that would fit easily in my purse so I could have it with me always. Not worth the sacrifice though. I'll stick with my big Canon."
2,Should have taken it back from the start.,"I HATED this camera from the first day. It was SO difficult to use. WAY too many buttons. It took me forever to figure out and I'm usually really good with electronics. The only reason I kept it was because I really liked the picture quality. Eventually everything had a blue cast and was very light. A friend who is a professional photographer tried to use the settings to balance this, it still wouldn't be ""normal."" Had to send it back to Samsung to be fixed when the lens wouldn't retract. As time went on the picture quality deteriorated. I have had this for approximately 2.5 years and it finally went. Magenta and yellow splotches on all pictures. Very dark pictures with shadows. Will be getting a new one and it will NOT be a Samsung. I very strongly regret keeping this camera."
2,"Tired, half-dead performances","Wow. Unbelievably bad. Eddy Arnold had one of the richest, most naturally gorgeous voices that God every put into any singer's throat. He was truly one of the greats! He should have quit while he was ahead. I'm not kidding, folks. This is a lame recording put out just for a quick buck. Each song is a deliberate snoozer, with no style, passion, or direction. Eddy probably put more effort into mowing his lawn or laying grout in his bathroom than he ever put into any one of these songs. I can't tell you how bad this album is. Strictly for geezers cranking up their hearing aids. Question: Did they record this album before or after they closed the lid on Eddy's casket? Okay. Enough with the hyperbole. It's hard not to enjoy Eddy's voice at any stage in his career. But in all honesty, this isn't a valuable addition to any fan's collection."
2,Came with No Directions!,"I would have liked some directions in this box. I sort of had to figure it all out for myself online and stuff, and guess how they should be used. I don't know how they wear in the long term because my we made the onesies for my sister's baby with them, and she hasn't even had the baby yet. So we'll see how they do when they are washed and used on the t-shirts. They are lots of fun to use and are pretty colors though. It's a good baby shower activity and good fun. They do get a little gloopy if you're trying to make intricate designs, and can get a little messy in that way. But if you keep the designs simple they look good. If you're working with artists who have low self confidence, you might want to just get the crayola fabric markers which are easy to use and more familiar for most people."
2,Ruined by Soundtrack,Macheads is an interesting premise not all that well executed. It wants to examine the history of Apple owners who have been and still are besotted by their computers. I'm one of them so was anticipating an interesting little documentary. Unfortunately it is mainly ruined by a deafeningly loud instant-migraine techno-thump soundtrack that often comes near to drowning out what the interviewees are saying.One Mac woman who lives in a caravan in what looks like a peaceful forest is barely audible above noise that sounds like party night at the local hiphop club.
3,Interesting But Dated,"By 2009, this documentary is very dated. I think it goes up to the release of the first iPhone. So much has happened since then, and the Mac community is more than a few strange people in the San Francisco area. We're all over. And yes, the users groups are pretty much gone all over, too."
1,Terrible,"This is a biased celebration of Mac users rather than an informative and intuitive look at the Machead culture. Nothing about this film was informative - all I got from this was a solidified notion that Mac fanboys are no better than religious zealots, just like any other fanboy. The only people' who would enjoy this film are Macheads; those whom are not in the Mac culture simply wouldn't understand or care about the film's content."
1,Boring,Don't waste your time. They spend too much time at some mac barn place and there's too much background music.
1,"Forget this... Get ""Welcome to Macintosh""","There are a lot of bland computer documentaries and most just regurgitate the same information that is commonly available through most media outlets. This is another example of that.However having said that, the same cannot be said for the documentary ""Welcome to Macintosh"" which has similar cast of characters but is a far more interesting and deeper documentary into the history of Apple and its products and the community that surround them."
3,"Strange People, Strange Movie","I liked this movie, but it could have been better. Definitely worth a rental."
2,Kind of boring,Did not find anything interesting about this documentary. I did not learn anything new about Apple and found it to be pretty boring.
3,Fun,"A bit shrill in its ""look at the bizarre people who use Macs"" emphasis. But a lot of good, solid information in there when they're not trying to cast us all as hippies or obsessed with Macs/Apple/Jobs/whatever.Glad Guy Kawasaki and Shawn King were in it to add some sanity to it all. And glad certain stripes of narcissists were left out - mostly. Some people are famous for being famous, and some people actually have intelligent things to say. They found a pretty good mix in there for most of the movie.Definitely worth the price of admission if this is a topic you're interested in, or you want to catch some of what makes Mac users tick. Though I think a sequel is in order to show the more normal side of Mac users."
2,For absolute beginners.,"I was very let down. Expecting to be let in on some secrets but disc wasn't really that comprehensive. It is something meant for absolute beginners. If you know anything about recording or Pro-Tools, rather just experiment for sounds. If it was about $10-$15 then perhaps it would be worth it."
5,Great info for beginners,Watch and Learn as Russ shows you how he does it and then have a go yourself with tracks included on the DVD.Had a lot of fun and will watch several times
4,Good Book!,"This was my first book by Berry and enjoyed her writting style. I liked this story. Don't you just love reading about strong black women that can take care of themselves. The only thing that kept me from giving this one top ratings was that Josiah, in my opinion, was lacking something that I can not put my finger on! I guess the guy did not make me go gah-gah over him. But that's just me!(joke) Good Read!"
3,BAYOU MYSTERY WITH ROMANCE,"Baltimore Detective Symone Rawlins haunted by the death of her brother, who was killed on a police call with her. She and her Partner were requested by the New Orleans Police Department to help solve a string of gruesome murders, which are similar to the murder case Symone work and was recognized for her outstanding work. Something unexpected comes up and Symone's Partner can't make the trip until later, but Symone continues to New Orleans, and met at the Airport by handsome FBI Agent Josiah La'mon, and there was an instant attraction. Ms. Berry surprise you with who the second killer is and how the killer is involved with Symone. This is the first book of Ms. Berry's I've read, and found it very enjoyable, and recommend it to you who love mystery with romance."
2,This is a horror alright. Disappointingly so!,"I get more scared at the misrepresentation of a weak shortstory than anything in it. Not to take away from Sturgeon but this isa story so predictable, it makes you wonder why he even wrote it. And taking it for what it is, a sad short story-it's still not that good. It has an interesting setup, with correspondences furthering the plot, but it goes nowhere and fast. Avoid. For horror, read King or Barker. END"
5,educational,This is very good book about horses. You can learn a lot of facts regarding horses.Very beautiful photos and drawings. Like it so much.1
2,Uninspired performances...,"I love Schubert, and was quite disappointed with this CD because the polonaise was performed with so little emotion, perhaps even a little too briskly. The performance I heard on public radio felt much more expressive and alive. The Konzertstuck also sounds like it could be more expressive in the hands of other musicians. Schubert's polonaise is a real delight, but consider finding a better, more inspired performance."
4,Great rendition,I love Chiarappa's playing. It's clean and clear. I wish more of his and the Academia Bizantina recordings were available in the US. This is definitely one of the best recordings of Schubert violin music out there.
4,great debut for a fantastic group of musicians,"lsd is one group of musicians whose music touches the world on a different level. most music is hear today gone tomorrow, but idylls is an album that can be listen to every day, and never have get old. it also features probably the most moving music the band has made to date. ardor was a great cd, but didn't move as much as this one does. faster beats and more driving keyboard on songs like forgo make this album the bands most diverse. check it out. its a great cd."
3,"Not perfect, but very listenable if you like the genre","If you're reading this you probably know you want the CD already. It's dreamy, moody stuff with a definite Cocteau Twins vibe---ethereal female vocals over layers of processed guitars and synths. I give the music a 4 out of 5, but take off a star for the production, which is overly compressed (not enough dynamic range). Other bands with a similar sound that I'd rate more highly are Autumn's Gray Solace and Fox-Glove Bell."
5,hypnotic dreampop,"the first of this duos (ryan lum and suzanne perry) albums just goes to show that more people in a band doesn't necessarily result in better music. all of you lousy DIVA's(christina, britney, mandy, what ever)... take note: suzanne's understated and entrancing voice is SIMPLy a more effective instrument anything you could ever achieve. this absolutely hypnotic and stirring album is just beautiful. of course, you're only taking the word of someone you've never met and have no idea of his musical tastes, but this cd has established itself at the top of my all time favorite list. If you are in the least interested in any aethereal-pop/shoegazer, PICK THIS ONE UP!!!"
4,useful birding tool,"I have found the Encross SR-M610 MP3 player a useful tool for my primary hobby, birding. I've been able to download bird songs and calls, store them on the player, and play them to refresh my memory or to compare with a sound being heard in the wild. The built-in speaker is quite satisfactory for that application, and enables me to share recorded songs with companions.Just as useful is the voice recording feature, allowing me to record field notes (I formerly used a much more cumbersome microcassette recorder).Using the player is relatively straightforward, and battery consumption is not unreasonable.The memory (128 MB) has been sufficient for my purposes, but the SR-M620 (256 MB) might prove more attractive for some."
1,"Bad product, poor design, no fix in sight.","I've been soldering for years, literally since the sixties. Wrong technique? Ridiculous. What if you slip? The tip is softer than chalk, literally, and I have a steady hand. When heated, its worse. Solder will break it. This is just a bad product. Replacement tips are ridiculously priced. Its several years since its intro, and no upgrades or fixes yet. There is no technique that can keep a human hand steady enough to make this product's tip last longer than its batteries."
1,Worst investment (tool wise) in thrity years,"After about fifteen suscessful uses of this tool, I was simply solder twisted phone wires and the tip broke. NOW..everthing in the instructions said the tip was fragile. But their description of fragile stretchs the imigination to its limits!So I called customer service. After a fifteen minute wait a polite service rep informed me that this is NOT uncommon. I said I had tried to purchase a replacement tip locally. (Chicago) I was informed that the tips are only available from Coleman and (her words) ""they are expensive"". How much?16.95 plus shipping. THAT'S MORE THAN I PAID FOR THE DARN THING!Draw your own conclusions. I will never, ever buy another Coleman product.1 star is the only way I could post this consumer warning..Amazon will not allow a lower submission."
1,Colman sold me the biggest piece of garbage,"The Tip was broken when I got it, I called Colman was told to call back in 5 weeks.The cost of a Tip is $9.95 + $6.95 shipping, I never will buy Colman Merchandise"
1,Invest in a real soldering iron,The tip broke during my first use. Ten dollars to replace. Only paid $15 in the first place. Believe the other posts. Pure junk.
5,Tells of Samuel Cody's many achievements,"Samuel Cody grew up on the Western frontier: as a young boy he was fascinated with kites and years later in England re-discovered his passion for them, eventually joining the ranks of the Wright Brothers and other early pioneer flyers. John Hill's biography for young readers, Rider In The Sky, tells of Samuel Cody's many achievements and captures the underlying influences on his life."
1,You get what you pay for,"Pen/stylus comes apart after just a few uses, leaving pieces lodged in the recepticle of my Treo. This happened with two of the three stylus. I didn't give the third a chance...in the trash!"
3,"Lightweight, Snug Fit, Problems with the Cap","I like this product better than the original stylus that came with my Treo 650. The original stylus started just sliding out when the Treo was turned sideways or upside down. This stylus fits snugly, and is lighter and thus feels nicer. It's also handy to have a pen built into the stylus.What's not handy is that the cap for the pen comes off easily with persistent use. Ultimately I went to pull my snug-fitting stylus from the Treo, and the cap came off, but the rest of the stylus remained stuck inside. I had to work with some tweezers and a small wedge to remove the rest of the stylus. My solution was to put super-glue inside the pen cap, and then re-attach it to the stylus. Obviously, I can't use the pen anymore..."
5,Raising Black Children,"I first read this book in 1992 when my daughter was 2 years old. I have found it to be a very useful tool in answering many of my questions with regards to the changes that she has gone through and the fears she may face as an eight year old. I also have an eleven year old son, who was having a problem controlling his anger. I referred to the book, and learned how to help my son understand the importance of controlled behavior, and alternative ways to express anger. I have also encouraged my son to read certain chapters in the book, to let him know that he is not alone in what he is feeling. I like the fact that this book deals with real life problems, and offers real solutions. My husband and I are parents who do not believe in spanking our children, it was a joy to read that the authors supported our views on the harms of spanking. I give away copies of this book to friends and famalies who ask me how we have been able to raise two, generous, kind and well behaved kids."
5,Enjoyed the disc,"I enjoyed the disc, ""Oceans of Dreams"". The production is great, and Frankie V sounds great. It is really a pretty and relaxing album. No hidden junk, just pretty melodies. I look forward to more."
1,insipid,"I'm not a big fan of ""smooth jazz"" to begin with, but this is the bottom of the barrell. Mr. V's sound is inconsistant- he cracks on the climax of ""My Heart Will Go On"", in the most painful example- and he's out of tune a lot. His soloing is trite, these songs have been recorded a hundred times already, and everything is overproduced, even by the genre's standards. I really didn't care for it."
5,Fantastically fun book for kids with curiosity!,"Pictures and stories about the things kids love most: the biggest, the fastest, the creepiest, the deadliest. Makes a great gift for the curious child. My own kids' fav was the 22 foot worm!"
1,Disappointing,Very disappointed that this book was personalized on the inside page and I was not made aware of that-I gave it a a gift!!
1,half the order,I ordered the sights on 5/10/2011 and received half the order. Called the company two times and still waiting for the other half. Am very disapointed with this company. Maybe after reading this review I will get a response. I believe they can figure out who I am.
2,bought as a gift,"I bought this as a gift for someone who loves everything that has to do with the 1980's, she was born in 1987. I do not thinkshe cared much for this and I did not think it was worth the money I spent."
4,"A very awesom 2 in one, All for 40 bucks!","This game is very awesom! Kof 2000's graphics have improved alot, Since 1999. There are alot of unlockables! In 2001 you can unlock 2 secret charecters, in 2000 you can unlock Videos of the good Kof classics! And unlock some secret strikers, From alot of Snk games! Although the art work arn't the one's we are use to... Kof 2001 art work is a little icky, But who cares? That's not the fun in the game! They've also have a new 3D polygon backround feature, The characters are still 2D( To tell you if you've never seen the pictures...) And Kula appears as in Extrain 2000 and appears to be a character in 2001! The story lines are okay but not the best i've seen... The music of Kyo is very cool! I could listen to it all day! ^_^... Well these are my opinions, This is a must buy but, What the other guy said, Rent it first and see what you think!"
5,"SNK, please come back and take over PlayStation2!","Alright, now we got King of Fighters 2000 and 2001 released for PlayStation2. Now please, I'm begging you SNK, release your old classic titles for PlayStation 2! Especialy the Samurai Shodown series! I tell you something...you just don't get games like SNK anymore now a days. When I was a kid, I absolutely fell in love with the SNK games, but no one I knew could afford the insanely expensive Neo-Geo at the time. The used Neo-Geo systems and games are now even more expensive then they were first released. SNK has seriously entered into a cult status, with some really freaky fans that I unfortunaley talked to on some SNK fan sites. The bottom line is that SNK must RETURN and rule again!"
4,King of Fighters rules,King of Fighters has and will probably be one of the best fighting games there has ever been. Tekken has nothing on this and neither does Street Fighter. This has been a game that anybody can get used to with its variety of characters and the way that the storyline can have the affect on you with the characters.
4,This is what I have to say about this book by Mr Gargiulo,I think it is wonderful. In one afternoon I learned everything I needed to know about how to shop for a new car that would be easy on the insurance rates and how to buy a great policy from a great company.
1,Not the best by Gigi,"I bought this product because I have coarse hair and the product information says it's for coarse hair. I was very disappointed with the product. The hair when covered with the wax came off in patches, leaving some of the waxed covered hair on the skin. Going over the hair, which is not advised, even proved futile. While the product has a nice almost aromatic scent, I find that the all purpose honee performs better at removing my hair. It does not leave bits of hair on the skin. I will therefore not be purchasing this product again."
2,Left Countless Stray Hairs,"I was actually expecting that this product would give me much better results than I got. I heard about how GiGi's products were wonderful, but I guess I chose the wrong wax or what! I have very course hair and am a first time waxer. However, this product left me so many stray hairs and after just THREE DAYS I had stubbles!!!! I am very unsatisfied with this product and I was hoping if anyone would know a better product for course and stubborn hair that would not leave so many strays...Thank you."
1,There are BETTER self-waxing products out there,"after spending a fortune on brazilian bikini waxes all the time, I decided to try this service out at home. So needless to say I have purchased several different kinds of wax, and this by far is the worst one. UGH- just like everyone says, very sticky, does not dry fast at all ,and I am not an amateur at this either so I know it is the poor product. I have had great results with the brand NADS microwaveable hard wax. Not messy, dries quick and no muslin strips are needed. I am getting ready to get more, and i guess this huge canister of GIGI wax is going in the trash."
3,Good Roach material,"This cd contains various tracks which were only available in limited release. Some of the material sounds similar to his desert like motifs. Others are much more darker. Most of his material is similar to his wonderful world's edge cd's. A few tracks in particular, Since We are Away, Repose, and Closer, are all fine examples of Roach's wonderful ambient capabilities. However, some tracks lack his wonderful melodies which were also present in his World's edge cd. With all things considered, this is a must for fans of Roach. Let's hope he keeps making great songs like this!"
3,mixed,"Full Moon Prophecy is amazing. Repose and Red Shore are wonderful. Closer, Expanding Again, and Eclipse are great. The rest are okay. And by the way, the album art was wrong: When I downloaded this album it showed the cover for Trance Spirits, a different album on which Robert Rich collaborated."
2,Almost Useless,"There wasn't too much interesting, or new material in this book. It was a long, futuristic analysis of things that are pretty obvious. The only interesting thing in the book was a picture of a tinkertoy cube that plays tic tac toe flawlessly. Some of the ideas presented were outdated, like equating human vision to a camera. The issue of retinal patterns having a role in vision was not addressed at all. This is a book for young children, it is not meant for serious researchers."
1,"It May Be Bella, but It Is certainly NOT ECCO!","The ad photo shows a full round of eye shadow BUT THIS PRODUCT IS ONLY A HALF ROUND.I bought it thinking it would fit into my old compact, but they have changed the size so that what you actually get is a half round that will not fit into the old compacts. Even if you buy two of them, the full round the two new eyeshadows produce is just different enough so that the old compace it obsolete and you have to buy a new one. THEY HAVE FORCED ME TO DISCARD A COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL COMPACT BECAUSE THE NEW EYE SHADOWS WILL NOT FIT.In my opinion, this is not eccologically sound at all, and it is a dirty trick that companies commonly pull to get customers to purchase more unneeded things. What could be the possible motive for changing the size ever so slightly, so that nothing at all is different except that loyal customers have to buy a new compact in order to keep using their favorite products? For shame!"
2,Not That Good,"This meter guage seems to be off quite a bit. It has registered less parts per million from rainwater I collected coming off our roof than water from our Brita Filter. I also have a Berkey Light water filter, and the meter registers 74 ppm with that. This is an unreliable gauge to me."
3,"Good price, but seems to not be very accurate.","This meter has a great price, but you probably get what you pay for. I get different readings every time I retest a solution. Sometimes, it is vastly different, but I tend to settle on the most common result of five tests. I'm not sure if I got a faulty meter, but it seems more likely that it's as good as the money it costs. I am able to get a relative idea of my ppm so that's all I really need."
5,Testing RO System,A great way to test your RO system to see if its working!I am able to test the water once a month at my convenience knowing what my TDS reading is giving me peace of mind about my drinking water.
4,Using for hydroponics with no problem,"I was going to buy a pricey EC meter, buy my hydroponics dealer said this one would be just as good.The only drawback is that it only has 3 digits, so anything higher than 999 ppm requires you to multiply by 10. (A tiny ""x10"" indicator flashes when that's the case.)I use it with my Aerogarden to grow lettuce, herbs and tomatoes. The only other drawbacks are1. It's not totally submersible, so I'm afraid of dropping it into my Aerogarden.2. It's not all that easy to read. But it does have a ""hold"" button, so you can read it after pulling it out of the water.For the price, I'm very happy I got it."
2,Very fragile,"It works, but you can only dip the very tip in. Why? Because the base (yes the part you put in the water) is not WATERPROOF! So if you have slightly too much water, and accidentally drop it in for a second slightly beyond the limit, the device fills with water. This ruins the device. So be VERY careful with this thing if you decide to buy it. I will not be purchasing another one."
2,This doesnt seem to work,"So I took it out of the box and tested it on my main line (non softened water) and it read 93 ppm. Then I tried it on my softened water and it read 107ppm.... Something is wrong here. So I tested it on Brita water and it was 120ppm, finally i tested it on Smart water and it was 160ppm...Is it supposed to read higher the better it's filtered? I'm thinking my product is a dud?"
4,Pas mal,C'est assez bon mais il y a des tounnes que je trouve moins bonne mais avec les vidéo c'est très complet
3,A bit dated and sloppy,"I'm a big T-Rex fan; Electric Warrior and The Slider are two of my all time favorite albums. That said, this DVD is not spectacular; it's great to see Marc Bolan in his prime. And clearly he is having fun playing to manic crowds and goofing around with Ringo Starr (who directed), and enjoying his meteoric rise to stardom.But the truth is that the theatrics of his live playing are a bit ridiculous (albeit apt for the genre that was dubbed glam rock) and the footage of Bolan with Ringo seems completely unnecessary and self-indulgent.Stick to the albums and only get this if you yearn to see Bolan in the flesh."
4,THE MOST ENCHANTING ATTRITION ALBUM TO DATE,"THE MUSIC CONVEYS SIMPLE TORRENT TO SHEER BLISS. ENGROSSING LYRICAL/VOCAL STYLE LIKE NO AMERICAN ROCK AROUND. FIND THIS AND ANY OTHER BY ATTRITION WITH OUT REGRETS... FIND ALSO ""HIDDEN AGENDA"" BY ATTRITION, FOR A TECH-GOTH EDGE YOU CAN'T REMOVE FROM YOUR SKULL......PURE TALENT..SO RARE......."
1,Big Dog Owners - BEWARE!,"I was *very* disappointed. The photo on the product and the Omega Paw website leads one to believe you could actually use this to feed a large dog. It only *looks* like the bigger the bucket the bigger the dishes. Ain't so, people. I have two 75lb dogs and there's nooooo wayyyy this food and water dish would work for a dog over about 10lbs or so. I had Yorkies before and it's size is suitable for a small dog only. Nice idea, but Omega Paw needs to adjust the dish size for to the dog sizes, not just plop the same small dish onto 3 different sized buckets. I returned the two I bought. Definitely a 'Buyer Beware' product."
5,Love this product,"I bought one of these for my 80 lb Bully and a small one (little buddy) for my 10 lb pug cross. The dishes on the Big Dog are much bigger than the dishes on the little buddy and just the right size for my Big Dog. I think this product is wonderful. The base doubles as a storage container for food and water. I also use it to store leash, treats, and anything else my dogs need for a trip. We use it to go to the cottage and it's great knowing that we haven't forgotten anything for the dogs. I am going to purchase 2 more to leave in the vehicle in case of any emergency situations. Also love that it is made right here in Canada."
4,Great for my giant breed girl when traveling,"This holds a lot of food - plenty for short trips with my giant breed dog. Once you realize how to work the lid to get it off, it's a pretty good piece of equipment. The one downside is that it should come with metal bowls that fit into the bowl ""holes"" because you need a way to remove the water when you need to access the food. I had one bowl that fits so I'm good to go although the bowl is round and the lid's bowl area is more kidney shaped. For me, it's good. Besides being able to use it for travel, I use it in the house to store smaller amounts of food while the rest remains in the garage, and it serves as the daily water bowl. The handle seems like it would eventually give way and break but I lift my full container often and there are no signs of stress on the handle after many months of use."
4,Have a paper towel or mop handy!,"It is difficult to get the top off especially if there's water in one of the bowls. Aside from that, it's a terrific product!"
4,Good things come in small packages,"This was indeed a very thought provoking book. The style was very convincing and also unusual. Ultimately it was a sad book, perhaps An Innocents Abroad for the 21st Century'"
5,It made me laugh!,"A funny story of a young Chinese woman arriving London to study English for a year. There she doesn't only discover a strange Western culture (such as whipped cream and scones), but a difficult language (why is there a difference between ""I"" and ""me""?) and an older man. The barrier of language and culture makes the love relationship hard, entertaining and sweet. Worth the read, if only to discover the meaning of inter-cultural competence."
5,Great exploration on cultural difference,"As a Chinese, I think this book truly protraited the deep-inside cultural difference between China and the west (at least Britain). I sometimes feel the same pain of misunderstanding as her when I am in the States. She is NOT a representative image of average Chinese girl today, (especially the ones in the cities) however, the underlying philosophy, e.g. attitude toward love, definition of relationship, intimacy, etc. are very genuinely presented in the book. I love it."
5,"you've got to work hard to write this ""bad""","I ordered this book after seeing a review in an Australian women's site. It is just shipping in the US now. I'm also amazed that there are only two (male) reviewers!It's a great book. Funny, sad, touching. A very Chinese take on romance.I personally also love novels that play with language such as Clockwork Orange and Riddley Walker. To me, this novel is in that category."
3,A Great Gift for the Right Person.,This was a gift and the feedback received from the Giftee was excellent. An easy and satisfying purchase for all involved.
2,"Well, it beat reading the ads on the subway...","Like everyone else who appearently read this book, I am an avid reader of vampire novels. Basically it all stems from the fact that I am on a seemingly eternal quest to find any as good as Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Well, this wasn't it. I found the whole book hard to get into in general. The plot was weak and boring, thewriting was flat and lifeless and I felt nothing for any of the characters. I was generally unhappy with the book. I will give it proper credit for not being a typical ""Bad vampire being hunted by random guy"" novel which seems to be the most popular kind of vampire novel, but it could have been much much better."
4,Read it a few times.,I always enjoy the down-home characters of Pamela Morsi. She lays out a story in an engaging way that is simple but fulfilling.
3,it's really 3 1/2 stars,A nice simple story about. a man called Simple Jess and the people whose lives he touched back in a time and place where women didn't have the freedom nor strength and skills to survive on their own. The kind of book I could read a second time.
2,Kindle Edition Warning,The Kindle Edition of this book has major formatting errors. Many paragraphs have no indentions and any apostrophes are missing. Aside from that Baby Paiseley is one of the most annoying children ever written in a novel.
5,A Must Read Romance,"This book is the second of a two book series of historical romance stories. I just can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. I highly recommend it. Heart warming, touching, romantic. Read it if you can find it. Check Amazon.com used books."
3,A sweet story..( 31/2 stars),"""Simple Jess"" was a truly sweet story..I thought that it had amazing potential, but sadly, it didnt live up to it. My disappointment in this book has nothing to do with the characters or the writing, but the fact that there werent enough interactions between Jesse and Althea. I felt that there were too many side plots that took away from the central characters and because of this I felt that the book suffered. All in all a good story ,but could have been sooo much better if only there had been more time devoted to the love story between Jesse and Althea."
2,Pretty nice system but needs to be improved,"This seems like a good system so I bought one. It provides a swivel base and a quick-release bar clamp. Upon mounting on a table, it does seem to provide a very verstatile way to hold various objects. However, two problems soon become evident. First, the whole system has a lot of play in it, so it is not really designed for any activity that would exert more than moderate force (such as hack-sawing) on the object. Secondly, there is a defect in the design that when you clamp the system onto a table, the release on the bar clamp is practically touching the table, which makes it rather cumbersome and hard to swivel the clamp or tighten or loosen the clamp. Back to the drawing board."
5,A Versatile Tool,The Wilton Multi-Grip system is a very well-designed and versatile tool for gripping or pushing against materials -- whether for holding pieces or clamping them. I have found it very valuable in ways that other tools were not capable of and highly recommend it.
4,The Best of the Worst,"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane has bad acting, superficial characters, and a plot that's...well...acceptable, and nothing more.So why did I give it four stars? Simple: Dice DRIVES this movie, and he cracks me up every time.I'll make it clear just in case you didn't get that insinuation. The only way you're going to like this movie is if you're a fan of Andrew Dice Clay. If you're not, don't even give this movie the time of day. Otherwise, this movie contains some of Dice's most quotable lines, and it's a must see."
2,average film,a few laughs here&there.but after all this is Andrew Dice Clay a no-talent wanna be comic.the film is hit&miss.better than anything else for Dice.cool seeing Shelia E&Morris Day in the film.Morris was funny in Purple Rain Dice should have been watching.Wayne Newton is alright here.though how he got to be so Famous is one of the many UNknowns of Hollywood? the Car was tight.
5,great,"if you love Dice Clay, then this is the movie for you. It's a little dated now, but still funny as hell!! Buy it snapperheads!"
2,Take this adventure on cable TV,"A few years before starring in THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE, Andrew Dice Clay had proved himself as a good comic actor in his superb supporting role in the film CASUAL SEX. Clay delivers a pretty funny performance in FORD FAIRLANE but the film itself just ain't that good, despite stand-out characters played by Wayne Newton and Gilbert Godfried. FORD FAIRLANE's probably worth a look on cable television."
2,COOL AND IRONIC BUT...,"Cool music score, great cast, big productionm budget, but the detective story, while laid out clearly and treated seriously is abandoned somewhere along the way. For all it's wildness it could have also proved to be compelling. Very ironic to see INXS'S Michael Hutchence's fictitious koalo bear hanging from it's neck, as Hutchence himself died from strangulation in real life long after this movie premiered."
5,finally!!!! the dvd i've been waiting for.,"Andrew Dice Clay as Ford Fairlane is one of the most underated movie characters of all time. The movie comes off a little dated after all these years , but is still great fun. Cameos from Robert Englund , Ed O'Neal and Kari Whuer. The dvd is awesome. The commentary is good , a very short making of and the trailer.Maybe one day a sequel?"
4,"""You're fired, Julie!""","Coming from a person who's not a fan of the Dice, I love this film. Some of the jokes aren't that funny, but the rest of the film is great. I love Robert Englund in this movie--proof positive that he can do other things outside of Freddy."
5,Funniest movie ever,Andrew Dice Clay is the greatest talent in the history of comedy. How this movie did not win best picture is a mystery to me.
4,pretty entertaining,"This is a pretty entertaining movie, as I recall, but not exactly super hilarious or super clever. At this point in his career, the Diceman had become very well known, and I get the feeling that this was somewhat of a standard movie to cash in on that notoriety. Not necessarily as funny or as shocking as some of his stand-up material, but still worth a look, partly because it's a slice of American pop culture history.

4,Wild Adventure,"Having had the misfortune for being politically incorrect at a time when doing so was not ""in"", Andrew Dice Clay's ""Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" recieved all sorts of negative criticism, some going so far as to say it was ""the worst movie ever made"".I felt differently.It was exciting, lively, everything an action movie should be.Forget what the holier-than-thou politically correct types say, watch the movie, have fun!!!!!"
2,Nothing great about it...,There is nothing special about this document. One will get better info online. No need to buy 10~13 page document. emvco dot com got lot of documents to download and study including NFC. Check that site.
4,Deltora Quest,"Do yo like action, adventure, and perilous times.Did you ever read Hatchet by Gary Pualson? Then you'll like the Deltora Quest series.Its about three sompanions that meet along their paths to find the belt of Del which has special gens that the companions must find to restore Deltora. The only problemis that each gem is protected by an evil guardian.Can they save Deltora from the Evil shaodow hand? Read to find out.I just got done reading this book and I seriously recommend this for readers that are interested in adventure and action!"
2,Bland Writing,"This book was recommended to me by another teacher at my school. He raved about it. I was very disappointed.The writing in this book is very bland. There is no passion behind the writing. It was like reading a text book. It had no voice.As for the story, it was a big let down. It builds up to a lot of possibilities of danger in the forests, but once they get there, they only encounter two dangers. And the conflicts with them were very anticlimactic. The story as a whole was pretty cheesy and uninteresting.I will probably not read the rest of this series."
5,Excellent series,"My 8 yo daughter started reading the series on a recommendation from a friend and nagged me to read them also. I am glad she did.Emily Rodda packs a lot of action in each book, and each book explores a different landscapes with new challenges. While borrowing a bit from Lord of the Rings the books demonstrate an amazing imagination at work.The books describe troubled times in the land of Deltora, so there is some violence in each book. To her credit, the author does not dwell on gruesome details. Most of the story concentrates on the friendship and trust that forms between the main players, and this is the overriding theme. For those with daughters: the book's main female character is very strong, independent and intelligent."
5,THE GREATEST BOOKS OF ALL TIME!!!( Meaning the whole series),"I THINK THESE BOOKS ARE THE GREATEST BOOKS OF ALL TIME! Even my sister can't stop reading them and she's 28! I can't put these books down. A kid could stay up all night reading these books. It's the most exciting, action-packed, thrilling Medieval/future series I have ever read."
5,One of the best series ever!!,This is absolutely one of the best series. Sure they are short books. There are 15 books in all. The main story is Leif and his friends Barda and Jasmine have to go on a very important mission to save all of Deltora. I'm not going to give any of the plot away though!
4,Perfect for younger readers,"A good adventure for younger readers. My seven year old daughter enjoyed it very much. I, on the other hand, found it somewhat light weight and simplistic, with some unoriginal trials and such like. But that only tells me that I want books for slightly older readers, and should not detract from this story that younger readers will thoroughly enjoy."
5,The book is....amazing,"I gave this book to my TEACHER!!! read it, thats how amazing it is!! I loved it i read the hole group of books"
1,BRING HIM HOME,"THE TWO MAIN ACTORS AND THE STORY DREW ME IN. NEVER AGAIN! THE PERSON/S WHO WROTE THE SCREEN PLAY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE/SHE/THEY WERE DOING. THE REST OF THE ACTORS AND I USE THE TERM VERY LOOSELY WERE AN EMBARRESSMENT TO WATCH. I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT THE ""SHOW"" WAS A FAILURE WHEN THE PRICE WAS SO LOW. I HAVE A LARGE LIBRARY OF DVD MOVIES AND THERE ARE SOME I WOULD GLADLY GIVE AWAY BUT THIS IS ONE MOVIE I COULDN'T EVEN DO THAT FOR I BELIEVE I WOULD BE STEALING THAT PERSON'S TIME. I WILL RESEARCH MY FUTURE MOVIES BETTER FROM NOW ON. SORRY I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE ABOUT THIS MOVIE ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE DOG TRIED TO PLAY HIS PART AS WELL AS THE SCRIPT WOULD ALLOW. THE REST OF THE CREW SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO HAVE COLLECTED THEIR WAGES. TOO BAD! A MORE CAUTIOUS PURCHASER."
4,Great CD,"My favorite is still Jennifer's ""Veering From The Wave"", but this is a very good CD. Beautiful voice and lyrics."
4,"Full sound, at a reasonable price","I needed to replace the front door speakers in my '96 Ford Explorer. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and I know how pricey Stereo equipment can get. I chose the Pioneer 3-ways. What a difference in sound, compared to Ford's JBL Premium factory speakers. The Pioneer 3-ways are responsive, and FULL sounding. I really didn't expect to hear such a profound difference in a lower priced set of speakers compared to the old factory speakers, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've since replaced the rear door speakers with another set of Pioneer TS A6871R's and the stereo sounds great."
3,decent factory replacement,"Affordable performance as a factory replacement, but if you want to turn it up pretty loud without distortion then you need something beefier than these. I wish I had bought something more expensive. You'll probably need to install bass-blockers with these."
5,Better then store bought and darn close to micro-brew root beer places,The refil kit is perfect everything you need to make 2 gallons of some of the best root beer around. I would highly recommend getting this after you buy thy Mr Rootbeer complete kit.
4,The Sorrow and the Pity transcript,"A fantastic accompaniment to the film. Whilst the film is near 4.5 hours long, the book offers a complete transcript, complete with photographes of scenes used in the film. Furthermore, a bio of each interviewee is provided at the start of the book. A fantastic commentary is provided at the begining of the book by Stanley Hoffmann. A fantastic resourse for a very controversial film."
4,A lot better than average!!!,"I bought this CD some 3 years ago while being out on my boat that summer, and then, the track ""I've Got To Make It To Summer"" just forever has a special sound, a special harmony. My favorite track on the record is ""My Time On Earth"", which just happens to be one of my very, very favorite songs of all times. I love Billy Gilman. He has what it takes to become/stay a legend."
5,~*Better than one voice*~,"1.she's my girl, i would rate this a 4, It's a fun song, its fun to dance to 2.Our first kiss 5, this is a cute story 3.Elizabeth 4, a very touching song 4. I've got to make it to summer, this is cute to..about a boy with a crush on a girl 5. my time on earth 4 this is a song with a messege 6. you don't you wont 5 fun and great song 7. she's everything you want 5, my personal fav., you can hear him BREATH 8. god's alive and well 4, another song with a message 9.The woman in my life 5 about his mom 10. Almost love 100, i feel the same way about billy, a song we ALL can relate to 11.Some things I know 5, how ute 12.shamey shamey shame 5, easy and fun for a dance routine"
5,I LOVE IT!,"Hi, My name is jon metts and i love thiscd this young man is GREAT!i hope he keeps this up.BILLY is a good role model for kids u see he loves his life and living his DREAM! WAY TO GO BILLY!!BY this cd this 12yo will grab your heart! His voice will touch you.I'm a 23yo man and i love him. I even play YOU DON'T YOU WON'T in a dance club that do dace to country and they LOVE it so thats why i rate this cd with 5 stars! go buy it now u'll LOVE it to..."
4,4 out of 5 ain't bad,"Three albums in two years. It's obvious Epic Records wanted to get as many CD's out of this kid as they could before his voice changed.""Dare to Dream"" has it's moments, but it's nothing like his first album ""One Voice""."
3,A nice CD but...,"Billy has a great voice, but his producers are at fault for not putting it to its best use. Ironicly, one of the best examples of what he can do is his duet with Charlote Church called ""Dare to Dream"". I thought when I saw the title of this CD, that they recoginzed this and named it such to indicate that they would be giving him those sorts of songs to sing. Well, they didn't. Some of the songs work for him, others don't. I think its not to Billy's advantage to be singing songs that were clearly written from an adult perspective, also. Billy will probably be able to put out another CD or two before his voice breaks. I hope he is able to continue his career, but his chances will be better if he gets some stronger songs to sing."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD expecting so hear good songs, but what i heard made me feel like kicking my CD player. 7 out of 12 songs were tweenie love songs! i mean, maybe one or two would be ok but...7! haven't billy's producers ever heard of moderation? having bought the CD, i might as well give my 2 cents worth...to billy's producers: please use his beautiful voice to HIS advantage and focus on good songs, not image. it is possible to be a pop star (if that's the aim) and have credibility. thank goodness Borders have a 14 day return policy!"
1,After Listening to This CD...,"I'm reminded of the saying, ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything.""End of review."
3,fragile,I probably was asking to much of this tool and bent the mandrel after destroying the first cut off wheel.Light duty cutting may be just fine.
5,Good all purpose cutting wheel,"I was able to easily cut through a metal bolt easily with this ""plastic"" cutting wheel. It looks identical to the metal cutting wheel. I can't tell the difference. Good product; good price; fast delivery."
3,"A gentle, easy read","Wow, this was a book full of spirit. The book features a fantastic range of aircraft in full view, from the old props right up to the superjet '47s of today. The book was, as I titled this article, a gentle easy read due to the fantastic self taken photos that covered the whole of the page, with small writing at the bottom. It was a great read, and Morton deserves a great deal of acknowledgement for it. Well done, I enjoyed it, Mr. Morton!"
5,Great Trees,A beautiful book with great stories of our biggest and oldest companions here on earth. It is well worth the cost and time.
4,Beautiful book,"A very nice book, with remarkable trees, however, from the cover I suppose I wrongly assumed they would be beautiful trees. Quite a lot of the book is spent on African trees of a very strange nature, and to my husband's suprise, very little was done on the banyan tree. I was looking forward to large, ancient trees myself. All in all, it is still a wonderful book, it just wasn't what we were expecting."
2,Needs editing badly,A lot of material gets covered here but not in a logical manner. Often subjects are discussed but not concluded. This is a user's manual not an essay on domestic policy. As a new comer to the world of TLR's I find that this book has some value as an addition to the actual Rollei manual but I wouldn't rely on it exclusively. I have a couple of other books from this publisher and they're much more coherent. Parker's Collector's Guide is a better book but has similar shortcomings.
5,DS Organizer,This organizer is the best one I have seen out there. The size is perfect for any age and the coral is great for little girls. It is made well and larger than anything else out there that I have found.
4,Perfect Case!,The slots are fine here and my seven year old daughter can easily get her games in and out with no problem. She loves it and so do we. I wish it had mote slots for GBA games instead of just 6. I made my own adjustments and slit some of the DS slots to make them bigger which worked very well.
5,cute and roommie,this is very cute and roommie!!! it holds a lot of ds games and a enough room for two ds and their cords! MUST GET!
1,Amazon Lies,"Though this product is listed as ""In Stock"" it apparently is not.My order, which was placed long before Christmas, was lost during the shipping process. When I contacted Amazon support to resolve the issue, they said the item was not in stock, and that they could not replace it. Amazon has replaced the Grinch when it comes to ruining Christmas.So why the hell does this page still list the item as in stock? Amazon lies."
5,Great Product!!!!,This is an awesome case for DS and games. My daughter loves it and takes it everywhere we go. It really keeps everything organized.
3,Okay,"I thought this would be better, bigger, more organized. It is the best one that is available yet; however, they need to make a better one."
4,Nice case,This is really nice. It can fit several games ds and gameboy. There is room for the charger and all the things we have to go with the ds. I would definatley recommend this product to anyone who has to look for games that have gotten lost. This keeps everything together.
4,Heaps Fun,"This is a really fun book with all the 12 year old couples mixed up and going to heaps of dances where they make idiots of themselves and stuff.Omigod,what happens to Amy is so mean and hilarious.The Unicorns make her dress up in all sorts of weird stuff,and Ken laughs at her."
2,"Mark Twain, Not","Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Raban's 'Bad Land,' I really looked forward to reading this book. Bad Land is all about pure unadulterated misery, but somehow the inhabitants of that god-forsaken place are shown to be decent souls with human dignity.Raban's just now clearing Lock 6 at Trempealeaw, and I'm abandoning ship before we've even left Minnesota. I can journey no farther south with this contemptible ass. His misanthropic disdain for people who show nothing but kindness to him is quite appalling. I'm no flag-waving provincialist; I'm something of a cynic myself. But, I've journeyed all over the world, and have never felt compelled to straight-arm a local's accent, clothing, mannerisms, dietary habits, housing, or the width of his neck.There are many other books available that document voyages down the Mississippi, usually in a craft much less river-worthy than a 16-foot speedboat. Try ""Paddle to the Amazon"" for a starter."
4,Mississippi modern,"Quick quiz:1. How many people have read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn?2. How many people have dreamed their way down the Mississippi on Huck's raft?3. How many people have actually boated down the Mississippi?OK #1 was a trick question: some of you were thinking of Tom Sawyer, right? But here's Jonathan Raban, a British travel writer crazy enough to actually buy a boat and do it. Skirting the dangers of barge tows, locks, and whirlpools (did you know there were whirlpools in a river?). But also surviving the stories of missed opportunities as he hears from all the quietly envious people he meets along the way. Raban confronts the difference between his own Huck Finn expectations and the reality of a river now ignored by cities all along the way, even as high-tech barges, once again competitive with railroads in decline, ply this historic highway. Mississippi modern: a real story this time - to dream your way through."
1,Very little Stainless steel,I returned the mugs I ordered because they were basically plastic ( very little stainless ) and I have my serious doubts about how long coffee would have stayed hot on my husband's commute to work.
4,"Fine, Old Style, Hard Country","Montgomery Gentry provides something that has been missing from country music for far too long. They provide a dose of ""hard country"" that doesn't try and pretend to be a pop crossover. Their music is neither jingoistic nor is it blatantly anti-American. Some may be convinced that they sing to ""red state"" values while others will be equally convinced that ""blue state"" working class people are the audience. The truth is that the audience is anyone who likes hard charging country music.Their vocal style is reminiscent of Hank Williams, Jr. of long ago and their instrumental style bears a lot of the same resemblance. There are definite southernisms in the manner of speech but the messages of the songs would be just as appreciated by a working auto plant laborer in Detroit.Great Job!"
3,MG 's sophmore slump,"This was MG's second cd offering after announcing to the world who they were with tattoos and scars. However IMO this album was a sophmore slump for a duo who has gone on to make two more killer cd'sThe CD starts off in a great direction with ""She couldn't change me"" and ""Cold on,Coming on"", however some of the other tracks such as ""blackjack fletcher"" seemed more like filler material to put out a CD to capture the wave they were on. Possibly this is why the CD only stayed as their latest offering for a little more than a year.If you are a fan of the songs that got radio play (such as "" she couldn't change me"") or are completeing a collection of MG material, then this is a buy, other than that, Any of the other 3 will satisfy your cravings for southern fried country a hell of a lot better."
5,SOUTHERN ROCK LIVES ON,"This will be short and sweet. These brothers have brought real southern rock back to life. In the family tradition of the Skynyrd band, their music has the REAL HEART & SOUL of what it means to love your family, your friends, AMERICA, and good old southern JAMMIN' ROCK! Bring on the next one---we need these guys!"
3,?????,"Don't know what to say...can't find a picture anywhere...but the tears are real, and that's all i have to give."
2,"Fairly Talented and Progressive, but...","At first I was drawn in by ""Thicker."" But this CD got old fast. The music drags, it has a depressing pull. The singing works for a little while and then it doesn't because it lacks polish and maturity and energy. And the lyrics are immature, if that means anythinng to you. Does anybody care what's being said anymore?"
4,Good New Stuff,"Chasing Furies is one of very very few bands in Christian music that is actually doing something new. Not mirroring a successful christian band, not mirroring a secular artist, but actually trying new things. That's refreshing, and encouraging. The downside is that it's a little raw -- while fresh, sometimes the songs lack the power and punch I wish they would have. So buy this album, but really keep your eye out for the next one. Maturity should really help them."
1,I still don't have a watch,"The watch was delivered not working. I sent it back. Rather than replace it with a new watch it has been sent out for repair. 4 weeks and counting.....Amazon's ""guarantee"" hasn't been much help. Maybe I'll buy books on Amazon in the future, but nothing this expensive ever again."
5,Great Watch,"This watch looks much better in person, it is large without being gaudy... It is quite comfy on my wrist and goes with anything I wear. The band is thick and is quite durable. Thank you Amazon.com and Hamilton, Great price great watch."
5,Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Watch,"Liked the simplicity and look of this watch. Read several reviews on the web and found nothing negative. Have been wearing it 24/7 since after replacing the leather strap with a nylon one. Love the look and feel of the watch. Lost about 10 seconds in the last 10 days, not to bad for an automatic. Numbers really stand out in the dark."
5,Good,Showed up on time and package looked really good. All of the parts came with and only took minutes to inbstall. Would recommend to others.
2,This product is misleading.,"This product is somewhat misleading. It is only one of the pictured grinders. I regret buying it, I should have realized it wasn't the set."
5,LA INDIA AT THE TOP OF HER GAME,"All due respects & thumbs way up to all the other spectacular artists & their fantastic tracks featured on this CD. But, it should come as no surprise, La India steals the show. Her highlights include Love & Happiness (of course), When You Touch Me & the show-stopper Para Los Rumberos (featuring a stunning performance by the late Tito Puente). I highly recommend."
3,Publish date is incorrect for hardcover - should be 1988.,"I purchased this book used because I thought it was published in 1996 and I have a soft cover version from 1992 that I wanted to replace. Well, this book is the version published in 1988 (hardcover with a dust jacket featuring a pot of vegetable soup). While a lot of the information is the same, it's obvious that this book much older than the version I have that's falling apart. The content is still quite good but be aware that this is certainly not a 1996 revision as it appears from the listing. I gave this version of the book (1988) 3 stars due to its age and somewhat dated content."
5,SMT overload,"As a huge fan of the Shin Megami Tensei series, I was really looking forward to this game. I also love Pokemon, so a combination of the two is especially appealing. Though, one thing that you must get used to if you are coming from the Pokemon series is you don't need to raise your demons. They are mostly used as fodder for fusions for more powerful demons. Fans of the series know that this is similar to the Persona series, especially SMT Persona 3. The dialogue is fairly simple. I assume this was to appeal to a wider audience. So, if you have kids, this is a great way to introduce them to the Shin Megami Tensei series at an early age!"
2,Tip- Drip........,"i bought this video thinking it would be like the nelly video (with the thick phat dancers shaking it) but to my disappointment it had flat white booty bit ches, (one so pale and flat she look sick) and only a few scenes with black chicks .the chicks in the club were tight)....this was an attempt at a hood movie by to many white boyss. (or lame azz brothers)"
4,Good Healthy Results For Over 5 Years,"I have two Giant Schnauzers. When I rescued my first Giant Schnauzer over 5 years ago, I researched dog foods. I knew I was NOT going to be feeding a raw diet and preferred a dry food. After researching I went with Eukanuba Large Breed Adult Dog food. My dogs love it! My 2 dogs are muscled up, work well, are healthy, have shiny coats and plenty of energy. I don't supplement their food. The vet always comments on how healthy my dogs are. I highly recommend this dog food for anyone, especially a large breed owner. I haven't ordered the food through Amazon simply because I pass a Petco on a regular basis. Now, if Amazon would offer this on a subscribe and save plan... I'd probably order through Amazon, since it's something I need on a regular basis. I took one star off since I can't subscribe to get the dog food, very inconvenient."
2,Don't be fooled,"While certainly not the worst dog food on the market, this is also not the best. Any dog food that lists corn, corn meal, or rice (dark/dirty or white,) as the number one or number two ingredient means it is predominantly just filler. Your dog will eat more because they cannot digest rice or corn and the food will pass through their system quickly, they will defecate more often, and because the food does not stay in their system too long, they do not get as many vital nutrients as they should. This one does say chicken as the number one ingredient, but corn meal is number two. It then goes on to list whole grains and chicken by-products (i.e. chicken livers, hearts, feet, everything you would never touch.) While the chicken is healthy, none of the rest is for a dog, and they are all the top ingredients. The nutritional value is not what they claim it to be."
2,Do your research,I had bad luck with this dog food (my dog had loose stools all the time). I did some research at www.vastpet.com and noticed Eukanuba was part of the recent recall scandal - I thought they were one of the bests. I did my research and went with a holistic pet food.
4,Interesting,I liked the material. This dvd goes back to the basic steps as a reminder. So If you have a background just get this one or the next level up. This has very good teaching methods.
2,overpriced,"Poor production overwhelms the dance content. There's no excuse for such poor quality these days - spend a few bucks and make a decent video!I bought it as a gift for my father (still a VHS guy) and he likes it, so two stars."
5,Intriguing dance video sweeps me to my feet!,Ive been searching all over for a dance video i thought suit me best. This one came out on top by a LANDSLIDE. The steps and figures are discussed perfectly to full understanding the first time around. This video was perfect.Excellent Buy !!!
4,open and hear yourself,"This music is to be used to open yourself inwards. Yes, as some reveiwers have noted it is repetitious. It is simple and allows for a quieting of the mind. It is not designed to entertain but to provide an avenue for glimpsing the depth within. But it must be listened to as a meditation. I very much appreciated this funnel inward so to speak and use it in the early morning as the sun arrives. If the other makams become available let me know and I will love to have them."
3,Hmmm... not too creative,"I was hoping that this would be some calming, middle eastern, spiritual music...well it was calming I guess, but boy is it monotonous (literally). It's the same tune over and over and over and over and over (didn't it annoy you to have to read ""over and over...""? Well that's how I felt after listening to the CD)It's well known that repetitive sounds are soothing to the mind, so I guess in that sense you are getting ""repetitive sounds"". But you might as well just leave your kitchen faucet on all night if that's what you're looking for, rather than paying for a CD.I have to admit that the CD relaxed me into a deep sleep for the first 2 or 3 nights, but that effect just wore out from there on.The last thing I want to mention as that when I say repetitive ""sounds"", the sounds I'm referring to are two: that od and the water pouring in the background. Sometimes he throws in his voice. But I think anyone who took basic music in grade school could learn this piece in an hour."
4,Great Prequel to the game but not a very good stand alone title,"I enjoyed the movie as a prequel and because of the background story of Flynn and Yuri but disliked some of the slower paced scenes and animated fight scenes, i thought it could have been a lot better. At the end of the day i think that any fan of Tales of Vesperia should watch a movie that helps add some depth to the story and characters"
2,Indifferent film that ties poorly to the game,"While this seems like a good idea at first glance, this movie was a fundamentally uninteresting side-story with a lot of inconsistancies when compared against the game it is supposed to be leading into; Concepts like Aer and Blastia are presented as working in completely different ways than they do in the game, and many details regarding Yuri and Flynn do not reconcile well with the game either. Other characters are presented essentially as cameo appearances.This could have been a really interesting undertaking, but it's actually fairly bland and doesn't connect well to the game under any sort of thoughtful scrutiny. Saved from a one star rating by some humor, decent production values, and chibi-Repede, who is the cutest thing ever."
4,Fine Display of Animation,"The plot was well written out, this animation is full of comedy, action, and a small amount of drama. I was not disappointed, and I do plan to watch it again. This film was touching and there were moments where I had my jaw open, the characters were well developed and even if you never played the game, you can instantly capture their personalities.There were moments where I questioned some character's appearances (one of them being in the game), and I wish funimation was able to retrieve the old voice actors for the characters in the Xbox 360 game.Nevertheless, I do recommend this film, it was truly amazing. It's a shame it's not even two hours because I definitely wanted more."
4,Yup,Word for word for the video game pretty much. You get a couple scenes you didn't get in the game but otherwise...I still enjoyed it though.
5,The kids love it,I burned out our old microwave and had to buy a replacement. It's easy to use even though the controls are on the inside. The various functional buttons are self explanatory and get the job done better than our previous model. The kids 10 and over have no problem using it and they like the look. Clean and simple.
1,Microwave started on fire!,"I bought this item 4-5 years ago and a few days ago, when I was defrosting something in it, it started on fire. The fire burnt a hole in the metal plate on the right side. We immediately removed the unit so that it wouldn't start a fire in our home. I called Sharp to let them know and they said that I would have to take the microwave to an authorized dealer and have them check it out. I was told that sometimes there is a build up of food on the metal plate which might have been the cause of the fire. The nearest dealer is 15 miles away!! They would not replace it and put all the responsiblity on me! This is terrible customer service. I'm buying a different brand this time. Will not do business with Sharp again!"
2,Sharp R-426LS Family Size Countertop Microwave blew up,"When my microwave first arrived, I thought it was beautiful and that I would enjoy using it. I had looked forward to getting it so much!The fourth time I used it -- to thaw a frozen bagel -- it blew up with a loud bang and destroyed itself, filling the house with acrid smoke.My money is down the drain, and I am bitterly disappointed."
4,Great Microwave,Had to buy a microwave for my new apartment. This one looks sharp and works well too. Very powerful and good size. It's easy to get used to the keys on the inside of the microwave and it's easy to set the clock! I recommend it.
1,"Bad quality, poor temperature control","This microwave eventhough it has a great sleek look to it, does not have very long lasting parts. The button panel has gone bad twice. And the interior rusted quickly. Also the built in auto reheat and cooking times for frozen veggies, etc.. do not heat correctly, either too high or too low. I do not recommend getting this microwave."
1,Nice 2 look at...for 18mths!,"This microwave looks good but it started to spark after 18mths, the plastic control panel bubbled up, and the door tends to stick. I would not recommend this purchase"
1,Not worth the money,It last only 1 1/2 year and then it started on fire.I need to pay $40 for the labor cost and i don't know how long it will last.DO NOT RECOMMEND.
2,Looked good but arrived broke.,"This microwave oven really does look great, but the unit arrived with the door broken. It also caused the start and stop switch to not function properly. We were able to return it and did not re-order."
3,HOPEFUL!!!,"we bought as a replacement to same model that had ""issues"" with sparks and smoking from the wave sensor inside unit (control side). I understand from reading the veryfine print that this panel has to always remain clean of any splatter and build-up .... the sleek looks and operation of this model are what we are after so we are taking another chance and are hopeful that with diligent cleaning of the inset sensor panel, our 6 person household will enjoy this microwave for more than the 18 months of the first one. It looks great in our newly renovated kitchen!! NEED it to work great as well."
3,R-426 Micro-wave,"Dislikes;Very noisy door... when closing it echoes within it's self. with a large bang from closing.Needs some sort of insulation to quiet it down for noise when closing.Print is hardly legable, so small.No graduation of power settings.Likes;Controls on the insideLike it's power.Is there an remote available for it?Is there insulation available for door?Is there a different door?Otherwise you've got a winner!"
3,Great Aesthetics; Poor Design,"Package arrived as scheduled in great condition.Pros:gleaming uninterrupted stainless exteriorpowerful wattagesuperb sensor - first popcorn bag was cooked to perfectionLess greasy finger streaks on timer buttons visible, easy to keep cleanCons:Having timer inside door is way more inconvenient than I realized for one simple reason: There are a lot of foods I undercook to warm up then cook in increments and allow heat to spread, reheat, etc. Annoying to have to open door each time to adjust time.Cheap appearing carouselDon't like clock color (green)Neutral: Worried about lifetime of door opening latches due to extra use."
4,Unbleached Mini baking cups,Found the product easy to use and held up in baking. Will definitely order again.
4,"Perfect Size, Like That They're Unbleached","This are the perfect fit for my mini muffin pan that I also bought here on amazon. I also love that they are unbleached, therefore limiting any leaching chemicals into my foods.I recommend these to mini muffin/cupcake bakers!"
2,"96 cups total, extremely expensive","I just received this item in the mail. I couldn't find mini muffin cups anywhere so Amazon was my last resort. For $14, I expected to get several hundred muffin cups (no quantity was listed). However, there are only 96 cups, making this product super expensive. I have yet to use this product."
3,Good but fragile when separating,I have no problem with these although some did arrive torn and I tore at least one other when trying to separate them but it wasn't too hard.
2,could be better,Nice that these are natural but they do not perform well. You may also end up eating part of them as they stick stubbornly to your muffins. I much prefer chef's select parchment baking cups since they do not stick.
3,How Good Can They Be?,"I bought these because I also bought a mini-muffin baking pan, and gave no thought to the price of $8.15 for 96 cups, with inexpensive Prime shipping. I just returned from the grocery store where I bought a package of 100 white Betty Crocker mini-size baking cups for $2.49. The Beyond Gourmet cups are from Sweden, the Betty Crockers are from Florida. When I get around to comparing them, I'll be curious to see if the Swedish cups are worth three times the U.S. cups, unbleached v. bleached paper considerations put aside."
3,I'm not picky when the price is as good as $2.50,I ordered these plain ones to replace pretty red foil mini baking cups that melted red all over my mini muffin pan.
4,Refreshing and Emotion Inspiring,"This music is wonderful, it can be used to put you to sleep, or to wake you up and make you feel all of your emotions! It can either be boring, or enlivening and refreshingly emotional. Most of the time i like it but sometimes it falls short in that does not reach me, but it is certainly good enough for 4 stars. more like 4 1/2.Similar in some ways to dead can dance, but more gothic in some respects (the vocals are a more gothic kind of style). beautiful, and better than Fire and Rain."
1,Pathetic!,"I have read MANY books on evolution and creationism and I am willing to listen to all the various arguements, but this book is the worst! There is NO science in these pages. The author's understanding of basic scientific facts and ideas is non-existant.Don't expect any intelligence within the pages of this book. It should be filed under ""COMEDY""."
1,A miserable waste of time.,"A miserable waste of time. Only the publisher, who sadly is trying to hawk his own self published mediocre writing has anything good to say about this meager and pretentious paragraph."
2,Color Not So Good,The color on this TV is horrible. There is discoloration at the top of the screen and on the left side and no amount of adjustment will make it go away.
1,no good,I purchased this tv 2 years ago. it has developed white lines on the top 25% of the tv. the repairman said it would be 150 to 200 dollars to fix. I have never bought a color tv that did not last at least 8 years. this is junk
4,Seller difficult,The television is great but the seller was difficult. Asked for more money because the price was not correct in the ad. The ad did not have the complete model number either. Eventually the TV was delivered for the asking price but I would not go this route again.
4,"Wow, get a grip and let it rip with this fitness gem","As we move into the new century Dave and Ernie realized golf had to progress also. It's no longer a game where weightlifting is looked upon with doubt and dismissed as silly. Listen to what Dave and Ernie have to say and try their iedas. If you have a high handicap or can play with then best of them this book can do nothing but help. Power off the tee can make those long par fours and seemingly impossible par fives very comfortable. Dave and Ernie,Thanks for a job well done."
3,Beautiful,"I love this Pendent, came from my beloved husband as a gift but Wearing it on a daily bases, turn my chest black?"
3,Moon Pendant Necklace Review,"I like it. It was bigger than I expected it to be. Even when size is mention, I have trouble visualizing how big it will be. But it is beautiful and I have worn it once. I just wish the medallion was a little smaller."
5,The Master Game,I can honestly say that this book is the only book I have ever read that's changed my life and the way I see the world.
4,One of the better ethno/ambient albums out there.,"I first heard ""Long Pig"" in 92 and found it utterly thrilling and surreal. The album is quite tribal: lots of drums, organic noise, primitive instrumentation, at the same time tracks like: ""tidal dance"" and ""a darker belief"" are highly ambient (i.e. keyboard/sampler noise) a la steve roach, robert rich and a hint of lustmord. ""Peyote"" showcases OYC's best work compared to ""Equator"" and ""Undercurrents."" These two albums both have pieces that recommend them (hear: ""Sunchemical"", ""Cloudcover"") but ""Peyote"" is a near masterpiece. I wish these guys would all get back together and release something new. Old fans of Skinny Puppy (esp. ""Mind"" & ""Vivisect vi"") looking for something mellower but just as beautiful and intricate would do well to give this an open-minded chance. p.s. This album is short, but it makes a great introduction the tribal/ambient genre."
1,the book was out of stock,"The seller got back to me right away, and said they couldn't fullfil order, the book was out of stock."
5,The best bass and pike lures I've come across,"I bought a few of these in different colors, but caught my biggest fish on the yellow tail. These Aglias have been my ""go to"" lures for the past couple years and have never let me down. If you don't believe me, try the #3 brown and black with a silver spinner and see for yourself."
3,A good beginning to a series.,"I had a bit of trouble caring about the supposed motive behind the murders and found it overly complicated. But I did care about the character of Matthew. He is well drawn, interesting and a character I would follow through a series. For me, though, the most interesting aspect was Matt's trying to deal with the plague and its impact, which was beyond imagination. It was a good first book; enough so that I shall read more of the series."
3,Black death and black deeds,"The black plague is spreading through England and, in 1348, it reaches the newly formed college of Cambridge, decimating the scholars and masters alike. Physician Matthew Bartholomew, struggles to find both a cause and a cure, with his modern ideas on cleanliness and good sanitation being scorned as nonsense by the other doctors at the University. A rash of unexplained deaths occurs at the same time as the arrival of the plague, which gives the murderers a good chance of passing the deaths off as being plague related. It's an interesting topic with the main characters well defined, but I found it to be an unnecessarily wordy book, with points being repeated over and over. I was considering this series to be a follow up to my beloved Cadfael series but...perhaps one more to make sure!"
4,Awesome Iron - yeah colored Green!,"After using a lighter iron for years, this iron's splendid. It irons away creases from tough cotton shirts with ease. As an iron it does the job extremely well. And for the price this one really rocks.A few things to keep in mind before purchasing this. This iron's heavier than the previous one I was using. Also it is completely digital. When iron reaches correct temperature, it makes a beep which is good but I wish there was a better way of notifying, such as the light going off which is the norm. Wish there was a way of selecting a different color other than green.Overall, iron's extremely good and definitely worth every buck. Definitely recommend. Giving 5 stars for the price vs quality.As a side note, I checked with B&D; about D2030 and D2020. They mentinoed that D2030's a newer model with the same features as D2020. So will save you money if you purchase D2020."
2,Iron Fire,"We purchased a D2020 Type 1 several months ago and recently my wife plugged in the iron, went into the bathroom to brush her hair and then heard a constant beeping from the iron. She went out to investigate and tried to pick up the iron but the handle was too hot. Upon touching the hot handle, she dropped it onto our insulated ironing board pad causing an immediate burn in the pad. This iron's safety shutoff device was clearly not working. By the time she got the iron unplugged, the iron was smoking, smelled of burnt wiring and the handle so hot that she had to get a towel to put it in a non-flammable area to cool off. It only took the iron less than 3 minutes to get to those extreme temperatures and surley if she was not there to hear the beeping, we could have easily burnt down our house due to the fact that the iron would not shut off.We're going back to a Rowenta despite it costing twice as much. Better than a burnt down house."
2,Digital Disadvantage,"Like many others, I replaced a 15-year old plain vanilla iron with a high tech wonder. Although I haven't yet put it through all its paces, I do know that the thing won't shut off (manual or otherwise) unless I pull the plug. I guess B&D double checked the one they gave Consumer Reports to review! So much for quality control."
2,Decent Iron... while it was alive.,"The B&D Digital Advantage started out as a great iron, although it did have some flaws in the design, like the steam dial moves while you are ironing therefore is always changing the steam setting. Also, the iron does an awful lot of &quot;spitting.&quot; It seems to have a hard time regulating steam. Last but not least, it died on me after only 5 months. Therefore I can only dub this iron a piece of crap. I have used a lot of irons in my day, and this one is by far the worst yet."
2,Auto shut-off isn't really OFF,"Be aware that this iron's auto shut-off is really a standby mode. The user guide says ""When the iron is picked up or moved, it will re-start at same temperature setting. To turn off the iron manually, press the power/temperature setting button for 2 seconds.""So if you bump the iron and it falls over when in ""Auto Off"", it will turn back on and reheat. If you want it to be truly off, you have to take positive action. I don't know about you, but that isn't what I expect from this feature, and it doesn't say this on the box.Apparently other B&D; models have this same notion of ""shut off"", so be aware and read the fine print in the user guidesOher than this issue, the iron works very well. It heats quickly and the variable steam is great"
2,Short Life,"I absolutely loved this B&D iron when I bought it - it irons like a pro- uses a lot of water, but I don't mind due to the great job it did. However, I bought it in October, 2005 and today it won't work. Like most people, I don't iron weekly anymore, so it hasn't been overused, nor abused. After reading some of the other reviews, I have to conclude that this is a poorly made iron with a very short lifespan. I will contact B&D but not sure I want another."
2,expected more than 6 months,"We liked this iron at first, though it does have a design flaw: the steam setting dial turns very easily and is located right under the handle, where you can't help touching and moving it every time you put your hand through - so if you're right-handed, you end up shutting the steam off without realizing it. We could've lived with that, though. I'm giving it 2 stars because after its first cleaning (there is a rather cumbersome process for doing this which I followed to the letter), its little computer went haywire and it wouldn't heat anymore. I called the company - they were nice and are sending us another iron - but in the meantime we had to go get another and were steered toward a Panasonic, which turns out to be a much better design. You might want to skip the Black and Decker and proceed directly there."
1,Iron does not work properly,"I bought this iron and it worked great the first couple of days, then it started to make squeaking noises and the steam stopped producing as much and sometimes not at all. I am taking it back and buying another brand, especially after reading the rest of the reviews posted here."
2,Expected a longer life span,I purchased the iron based on Consumer Reports' top rating. It worked well enough for 3 1/2 years except for a problem that occurred when I changed ironing board covers - so much steam went through the new cover that the resulting condensation damaged the finish on my hardwood floor.I'm discarding the iron today because of dark scale-like debris that falls out of it. The scale problem started a few months ago and has become intolerable - I spend more time cleaning it up than I do ironing.
5,Great iron,"I love this iron. I had no idea how poorly my old one was until I started using this new purchase. I agree that it does use water quickly, I have to refill the water container more often but it is worth it for the wonderful steaming quality. My clothes actually look like I have pressed them now!"
1,"Blinking clean, clean, clean","I got this iron as a gift. I loved it at first. Then tonight when I REALLY needed my iron it began blinking ""clean"" I cleaned it plugged it back in. It stopped blinking clean, but it just never got hot again. Like others have said, maybe it's the digital components. I hope black and decker reads these comments. So frustrating!"
1,USELESS,"We loved this iron for a month. Then it suddenly stopped working. The handle is warm, but nothing turns on. I'll take the old non-digital one over this fancy iron any day of the week."
1,Short Lifespan - Bad Warranty,"Although this iron is very heavy, it did a good job of ironing. However, after six months, the latch that secures the water tank door broke off. Needless to say, the door can't stay closed, so the water spills out over the garments. I called Black & Decker (Applica) customer service and although my iron was covered by warranty, there were so many conditions...a $5 dollar handling charge, I had to cut the plug off the iron and mail it in (at my expense); AFTER receipt of the plug, I would receive a similar replacement iron. I asked for another digital iron and was told they were on back order, with no date expected.What kind of warranty is that? I would be without an iron for weeks, maybe months while waiting for a 'similar' replacement. It was easier to just buy another iron and not a Black & Decker."
2,Worked very well for 5 months,"I bought this iron, thinking it will be an end to my ironing woes. Alas! if it was true. This iron worked wonderfully for 5 months and then mysteriously one day it stopped producing steam. I tried to clean it but even that didnt help. It just kept making sputtering noises. So, I called up B&D and they sent me a replacement iron... not the same one - AS175, which is not even digital. I am disappointed in this iron and do NOT recommend it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I was in love with it for the 5 months it did work."
1,This iron burned my curtains,"The first time I used the iron, I was ironing curtains. Half way through the curtain, the iron suddenly heated up, burned the curtain I was ironing. The heat would not stop, it also burned the ironing board cover. The only way I could stop the heat was to unplug the iron. Later, I tried turning it back on everything seems to work, except the iron never gets warm. It is now useless."
4,good rating from Counsumer's Report made me buy it,"After checking Consumer's Report, I decideded to buy this iron.Thus far I have been pleased. I lack strength in my hands and have a little trouble pushing the spray and steam buttons, but otherwise am pleased with the iron. I have had it a month."
2,leaks and pieces broke off,I purchased this iron about 1 year ago due to a good review in Consumer Reports. I am disappointed with the quality. After only about 1 month of use the iron started to leak and spit large amounts of water. Then the cap that covers the water reservoir snapped off. Its time for a new iron already and for $37.00 I should have gotten a little more time out of it.
4,A Dose of Reality,"First of all I want to say that this iron rates as one of the best I've owned for a year. I say that because after one year, it quit on me. Prior to that, it was awesome. I do understand a bit of reality and that is, ""They don't make products to last like they use to."" That being said, I feel like I got my money's worth out of this iron. I am ordering that exact same iron today because of how well it worked for me in the past. Hopefully, I'll get more than a year out of it this time around. I used my iron a great deal so all things considered, it held up well. If I would have gotten at least 2 years out of it I would have given it 5 stars."
1,the unit didn't power on!,"I got this on sale from Targets for $35. Eagerly I plugged in the unit, turned the variable dial to maximum steam, and increased the digital dial to 7. And then I waited, and waited, and waited, for 10 minutes. The iron never warmed up, let alone hot enough to iron anything. I can't say this is a bad product, but surely I got a non-working unit."
2,Two years seems to be the standard lifespan of this iron,"I've owned two of these irons, and had identical experiences with both. On the plus side, the soleplate is very smooth and glides easily, and the steam function is powerful and will get out even set-in wrinkles. On the minus side, at precisely the two-year mark, both irons had their temperatures regulators go bad, and they overheated to the point of burning out. When this happens, the iron starts beeping continuously and won't quit until it's unplugged. Since this is a built-in feature, the manufacturer is clearly well aware that overheating is common but doesn't care enough to solve the problem. Despite my initial satisfaction with this brand, I won't be purchasing it again."
1,Died after 3 years,"This iron worked OK, but then stopped heating after I had it about three years. Since it needs a special tool to open it up, I was unable to take it apart to see if I could fix it, and it's not worth the cost of having it repaired. Maybe I got a lemon, but it should have lasted longer."
1,Doesn't last,"This iron didn't work very well when it did work, but it stopped heating after a few months. We bought a panasonic (with the nickel coating) which is fantastic."
1,Stopped producing steam after 2 months,"Very strange. My iron D2020 also stopped producing steam after 5 months. I bought the iron over a year ago but couldn't use it due to a move. I called customer service and they told me that the warranty ran out. They said that they have a complementary price for a new iron for customers such as I. The iron supposed to be a newer model for $37.99 (including shipping and handling). I received the new iron today and was very dissapointed. It was not a newer model (D2000) which I can purchase at WalMart for $39.99. What a great price they offered me. :( My older iron also had a much longer cord.Many reviews say that their iron stopped producing steam after 5 months or had some other types of flaws. This is very strange. Black & Decker, I believe, should be aware of this by now but customer service acts as if it's something new. Very upsetting.I will never ever by another Black & Decker iron again."
5,easy and powerful,"after going through several irons that broke or quit working, i'm so glad i chose this one.pros --easy digital control-powerful heat that works but doesn't threaten delicate fabric-finally an auto-off function that works how it's supposed to!! (it shut off once when i had to walk away from it for several minutes, but never shuts off while i'm using it)-great steam functions (i don't do much bulk ironing, but it's perfect for those hard to smooth dress shirts)-the price seemed reasonable (not as cheap as some, but much less than the really high end models)cons --i have to refill the water cavity every time i use it?? honestly, as long as it doesn't give out on me like some of my old irons, i can't say anything bad about this one."
4,Great iron for the price,"This iron replaced an very old one that I had, also from B&D. This one is light weight and has very effective steam. Everyday-type wrinkles in cotton come out easily. Tough ones need more steam and pressure. One slight problem is that the steam comes out in large drops from time to time, but not often. Generally not a problem, but owners should be aware if ironing very delicate fabrics. Other than that, it's a great iron!"
2,"Great iron. Died after 1 YR,.","This was a great iron. Lots of steam, large water tank, and no water leakage. All translated into very easy ironing.Sadly, the iron died after a little after 1 YR. Black and Decker just does not build durable irons.Stay away from this one unless you are OK with a short lived appliance."
1,"Worked great, at first...","I was very pleased with this iron during the first several months that I owned it... but recently began to have some problems. After a few months, the spray button began to stick, which was annoying but manageable to work with. Then in the past couple of weeks the iron has begun to overheat (keep in mind that I am usually ironing maybe 2-3 items of clothing every day or two -- not heavy use by any stretch). It would overheat within about two minutes of plugging it in, giving off a burning smell and beeping constantly until unplugged. Thankfully I purchased mine at a local dept store that was willing to exchange it for another brand. I strongly recommend holding onto your receipt if you purchase this product. For what its worth, I thought the iron worked wonderfully while it worked."
3,great iron but didn't care for the fire,"This iron works great, yes it uses it's water capacity very quickly and did leak over the clothing at times but when it did what it was supposed to do- it did take out wrinkles very well until..... it started shorting out and smoking and burning. I called B&D and they will replace it free because they've had some ""Issues"" with it so BEWARE. Never leave it unattended or you may need to buy more than another iron. Maybe the new D2030 doesn't have these ""issues"""
4,good job,this iron is almost perfect to use except it is a little too heavy for me--still like its performance.
1,Disappointed,This iron received thumbs up from the consumer testing world. So I bought the iron. And for a while I was thrilled! That is until the latch stopped closing tightly. Warranty schwarranty - I'll just fire up my 9.99 Phillips and leave the digital advantage for trash pickup.
1,"Nearly caught on fire, ruined my shirt",This iron worked splendidly for over year before almost catching on fire while I was using it. I was pressing a shirt when suddenly the LED display on the iron shut off and started beeping repeatedly. I smelled smoke and the handle was hot to the touch. I lifted the iron off my shirt to discover a dark scorch mark ON MY BRAND NEW SHIRT!I do NOT recommend this iron -- you risk burning your clothes.
1,Iron failed after 2 years use,"We have used the Black and Decker D2020 for two years and it suddenly failed yesterday. The iron no longer gets hot even though the AC on light is lit and the digital display functions normally, There are no troubleshooting instructions to diagnose the problem in the manual or online. The iron has not been damaged in any way by us. This is either a poorly manufactured product or a poor product design. I would strongly urge you not to buy it."
5,Not sure which iron you have but mine works great!,"I have had the D2020 for some time now and I have not had one complaint. For the past 5 months I have used this iron a few times a week and nothing has jammed, fallen off, or burnt. the steam function works great and makes my clothes look like they came right form the dry cleaners. I recommned this item to anyone looking for a valuable iron."
2,Short Life,"The D2020 I owned was purchased 04-05-2004. It stopped operating as a steam iron 09-09-2004. It was a great iron while it lasted. The stainless soleplate is better than any iron I have ever used. However the latch that covers the port where you fill the iron is very cheaply made, and if you're not careful it will break off. The iron on occasion even after cleaning each month,will drop staining droplets of water onto your clothing. You must be very careful when ironing white or light clothing. Also, I find it difficult to use the dial while cleaning. A person with weak hands will not be able to use this feature. I have read other reviews stating that this dial was very loose. My dial was stiff and hard to turn. And finally after just 5 months it stop giving steam. CS has offered to replace my 2020 with the 2000. I hope this is a better iron."
1,Great while it lasted,"We purchased this item from Target over a year ago and it was wonderful, easy to use, and very smooth! Unfortunately it just stopped working after a few months (5 or 6) for no apparent reason. We liked it so much that we purchased another one sometime last July (04) and enjoyed it until it give up the ghost just a few days ago (that's two in a row). I suspect it has something to do with the Digital components. This was a good iron but it is useless if it doesn't work. Be prepared for a short product life / have a backup. I give it 1 star because it should last a lot longer for the price."
3,This iron spits a bit too much,This iron is best and glidding over your clothes and producing a lot of steam. So much that I often have to fill the iron up more than once before I'm done. On the bad side this iron spits a bit too much. On at least three occasions over the last 3 months I've had to pull something else out of the closet due to the iron spitting stains on my clothes.
1,Leaks,"I purchased, yesterday, the D2000 after the customer service representative for the product said it was a newer model than the D2020. The iron leaked. I exchanged it today and the second one leaks as well. Tomorrow I will obtain a refund and purchase another brand."
5,D2020 Digital Advantage Iron,"I have only had this iron a short time but I like it very much. I like the extra large water resivor, and while this iron is on the heavy side, I got used to it quickly. Beside being used for my weekly ironing, I quilt almost daily so there for this iron is used almost daily. I like that it automatically turns off when not in use. One little touch of the iron and it automatically turns back on to the temperature last used."
1,Fine Iron for the first 1.5 years if you have a good kufe insurance,"It was a very good iron for the first year and a half. And then, one day, wile I was peacefully ironing my shirt, the electric charges started to appear inside the water container so that I had to disengage immediately to avoid electric shock. Eventually, after spreading the burning odor all over the iron died. In my opinion in the 21 century irons should last little longer than 1.5 years and present no danger to the life and well being of users."
3,Electric iron rewiew,"The iron is heavier than I anticipated and the steam adustment is not in a very convenient place, but other wise is fine."
3,PacMan,"I don't know if it was picked up on this transaction, but I was signed up for A MEMBERSHIP to a website that I did not join and it has been a hassle for me. I also thought I was getting the game for a WII and it was for a Gamecube and I gave it to my grandchildren."
4,Pac VS : Great party game,"Pac man World 2 - didn't get a chance to play it since the disc I received was scratched and unable to get very far in the game. From what I did get to play, decent game for kids.Pac Man VS - a very good party game if you have a Gameboy Advance and a system link so that you could hook it up to your gamecube. It is ABLE TO LINK TO YOUR WII. I had to research and take a chance of hooking up my Gameboy Advance to the Wii, which does work. Thank goodness for backwards compatibility.For those who are looking to buy this game just for Pac Man VS, it cost me $25 for a used Gameboy Advance, $10 for a new system link and $5 for the actual game. Worth it? It's up to you to decide, but it was for me. Oh nostalgia.I give this a 4 out of 5 star because the Gameboy Advance only works in perfect lighting when you use it to VS friends. Difficult to play when not in perfect condition, but game itself is CHEAP."
4,"PacMan Bundle(Pac-Man, Pac-Man World 2)",I really like this game. I was disappointed when I found out I can't play both disks on my Playstation but I'll give that one to one of my Grandchildren.
3,Overhyped,"Eh! The first game, Pac Man World 2 seems to be uninspired. The controls, which, for me, are a very important part of an 3d adventure game, aren't quite right. They aren't wrong, its just they need more subtle tweaking for more enjoyable game play. I should state that I'm not very far into this game and things could change but I'm not expecting them to.The second game, Pac Man Vs. is a good amount of fun for about 45 minutes at a time when you have 3 or 4 people. I found it to be kinda boring when there are only two people playing.For the price this isn't a bad deal. Just don't expect a four or five star game play for a bargain bin price point."
3,NOT the original,"The product description page states ""In the original Pac-Man, you'll face the ghosts who've trapped you in a maze...""Beware: This is NOT the Original Pac Man. So, don't buy this if that's what you're looking for.We wanted to purchase the old-school Pacman game for our Wii system and thought that a Gamecube version would be fine. Based on the above description, that's what we thought we were getting.No so. This game (disc one) requires a special cable AND a Game-boy advanced unit in order to play and it's NOT the original pac-man game. It's a competition party game requiring 2 or more players.I can't really rate Disc one since it can't be played on my system. I can only state it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.The Pacman world game (disc two), on the other hand, is what you would expect; a 3D dot-chomping trek through colorful, cartoon worlds. Easy to learn. Fun for young kids."
1,Not what I thought,"I was looking for playstation 2 games, and I apparently mis read the ad for this one, because it is not for the PS2 gaming system"
1,Not as shown,The picture for this item is not correct.If you are going to sell solid rotors then show a picture of solid rotors...NOT drilled:(
1,Brake,"Cuando realice la compra me enviaron un producto que NO pedí, no los recomiendo. When buying a product they sent me did not ask, do not recommend"
4,Rotors,"These have been in my garage for a while now, and I am so happy I finaly put them on. These are awesome, my brakes are so much more responsive and feel solid."
2,A good read for one casually interested in the Romanovs,"I opened this book with anticipation: I have been in love with imperial Russia since childhood. I have read at least 50 books on the Romanov's Russia, and lectured on ""Romanov psychology"", but I found this work a bore. Ms. Erickson revealed nothing new and cited (mostly) secondary and tertiary sources. I felt as though I was reading a Danielle Steele novel at times (with apologies to Ms. Steele...I wish I had one-one hundredth of her success as a writer!) H.I.M. the Tsarina was cast with Scarlett O'Hara-type melodrama, while every serious reader knows Alexandra was far more complex than most fictional heroines. I recommend Greg King's The Last Empress (far from perfect, but, in my view, better researched and written) or Robert Massie's legendary Nicholas and Alexandra. I'm sorry Ms. Erickson, I LOVE your Tudor series, but you really dropped the ball on this one."
1,Absolute Fluff,"This book was extremely disappointing. There is so little valuable and insightful information about the Tsarina, and what information there is is simply fluff. This book barely skims the surface and leaves so much out, takes so little time to actually analyze information that it leaves more questions than it answers.If you are looking for a quick read, or an introductory book to Tsarina Alexandra this is it. Otherwise, I highly recommend ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" by Massie."
3,Worth a skim,"I'm not an Romanov scholar by any means. My interest in the topic is no more than passing. That being said, I consider this book an engaging read for the total neophyte. The basics of the story are here, along with some colorful speculation to round it out.But it's the speculation that got to me in the end. I began to notice how often the words ""may have,"" ""might have,"" ""would have,"" ""probably,"" ""must have"" show up in the text. The author crafts her story around a host of unknowable thoughts and reactions. It makes you question the portrait she paints of Alexandra, and Nicholas for that matter. (The author's persistent use of Alix and Nicky becomes cloying and distracting over time, by the way.)But if you want your history accessible, by all means this is worth a skim. I admire an author who can make the past come to life."
2,Disappointing,"I've read all other Carolly Erikson books and have, for the most part, enjoyed them. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. While there were some strong insights into the complexity of Alexandra, still, the character came across as bland. The book felt as thought it was not well-researched and hastily written."
4,Couldn't put down,"Maybe because this was the first book I've read on the Romanovs, but I was fascinated with the story of Alexandra and her entire family and the time she lived in. I'd recommend this book highly."
3,"Good, readable bio","Carolly Erickson always produces a good read, and this book is no exception. There are no searing insights here, just a solid understanding and communication of her subject. I found the presentation of Alexandra quite balanced, unlike the martyrology we find in many books concerning the fall of the Russian monarchy. Buy this book. You'll enjoy it."
2,BORING,"There is nothing new here. Same old story of this stupid woman. She destroyed her weak husband, his government and the entire Imperial system. The book has the feel that all the research that was done was reading other people's books."
2,Too biased,"I am a huge reader of Romanov history and I looked forward to reading theis book. Although an easy read it did not really touch Alexandra's character. I agree she came from a neurotic background and it seems to me that Alexandra was in her way a bit of a ""know-it-all"". Her intense faith in Nicky's right to the throne, regardless of the fact he was an extremely poor leader added to the downfall of the Romanov family. I found Greg King's book far more interesting. I am hoping Helen Rappaport will write a book on Alexandra's life. Her book ""The Last Days of Yekaterinberg"" is excellant! A must read. I have read 2 or 3 of Ms. Erickson's books and find them more fiction than history."
5,"Great Price, and Adorable !!!","I had seen this product while traveling and skimming through the SkyMall catalog. Unable to find that product through them I relied on Amazon, and much to my surprise, I found it. This was a gift for a little girl, who's mother works in a hospital. We got the shirt embroidered with her name on it with ""Dr."" in front of her name. A great product for kids, especially when it comes to dressing up and playing!!!"
5,A beast of a story!,"The Beast In The Bathtub is a cute story written by Kathleen Stevens and illustrated by Ray Bowler.""You get upstairs and take a bath this instant,"" said Lewis' mother. ""All right,"" said Lewis, ""but you'll be sorry if the Beast eats me.""So Lewis ends up in a water fight, an apple rustling, and a pillow fight with... the Beast, who, it turns out, really is a large, green, fork-tailed Beast! But the Beast enjoys playing with Lewis, who ends up telling his parents, ""Of course there's no Beast in the bathtub,"" he called. ""He's under my bed.""This should be a fun book for young readers and those who like to be read to. Enjoy the Beast!"
5,"Great CD, one of the best ever!","I mostly listen to this at night when I'm laying in bed trying to sleep. This is the greatest cd and the best band ever. ""The morning breaks so cold and gray and I'm still here alone"". Must buy this. It will take your soul and bring it to new levels. I get chills of sadness every time I hear the music. Experience this for yourself no matter what you listen to now. This is a must buy. Also, check out Ionia, Wake, The Burning Circle, Cold and Estrella."
5,Tippee Tippee Tiptoe,"On behalf of the children and myself at Neighborhood Child Care Center in Rochester, MI, we have had so much fun listening to and re-reading your books, ""Tippee Tippee Tiptoe"" and ""...Like a Cat""! The books have expanded our movement vocabulary: creep, sneak, scatter, tip-toe, stomp, jump, twirl. Now, when I want to manage the energy in the room, I can call out a movement and the kids eagerly and appropriately respond.The children enjoy the bright eyed, colorful animated characters, a great compliment to the expressive words.Thank you for your fresh and artistic ideas. You make learning FUN!Todd Greenbaum, Co-Director, Neighborhood Child Care CenterMiAEYC Wolf Trap Performing Arts Director"
5,A great read for anyone!,"I absolutely love this book! I read it in one sitting - it's only about 35 pages long. Bl. John Paul II's words are so inspiring! I bought this book for my sister as well, since she's trying to find some direction in her life right now regarding college and career. I think it would be great for anyone to read, especially those who are coming upon an important decision in their life, or just looking for direction.It's great too because it addresses not only youth, but those who are older, those discerning the priesthood, religious life, or marriage, and parents!"
5,Fantastic,"I read this book in 1997. Unfourtantely, I lost my copy years ago, so I can't make specific references to what I loved about this book. But I did love this book very much. I have put it up there with some of the greatest books I've ever read, such as A Wrinkle In Time and Watership Down. I think Jackie did something really fantastic with this book, and I thank her for the experience."
4,"Great movies always have great music, and this does too...",No better way to get the morning moving than with this soundtrack. My young teen son even loves this cd!I really like the song Pieces by Dan Powell but can't find anything else done by him. Does anyone have any information on Dan Powell?
5,Awesome album!!!,"I saw A Knight's Tale on opening night last Friday and I imediately knew that I had to get the soundtrack! It is so great, especially songs like ""The boys are back in town"", ""We Will Rock You"", and ""Eye Conquerer"", by Third Eye Blind. If your having second thoughts about getting this CD, then Don't. Buy this CD and you will relive every moment of the movie. This is the best soundtrack I've ever purchased and you won't regret it."
5,Classic rock fans will love this!,"The soundtrack was pretty much the only thing that salvaged this ho-hum movie... This soundtrack offers up a wonderful compilation of great classic rock music that will have you dancing in your car, or at home!I have always been a fan of classic rock, so this album was made for me. Everyone from Queen to Heart to Thin Lizzy is on this CD making it better than any of those 70s compilation CDs that have one or two good songs on them.There are some surprising little remixes, but nothing that really screws up any of the classics of classic rock... And, there is a great little song by Third Eye Blind thrown in too.This soundtrack is one of the best I have heard in a long time."
5,AWESOME!,"The movie was outrageous. Especially Heath Ledger. The movie is funny and it is amazing. I would rate the movie on a scale of one to 10 as 15! The soundtrack brings the movie alive and makes everything come together. Just the fact that you have the peasents of England in the Medieval times chanting to ""We will rock you"" by Queen is worth going to see! This movie is AWESOME! And the soundtrack is even better! If you haven't seen it GO SEE IT and then get the soundtrack because you will know what I am talking about!"
4,An Awesome Classic Rock Soundtrack!,"This is an incredible compilation of great radio friendly classic rock tunes. There are some cool tunes by more current artists also, such as Third Eye Blind's ""Eye Conqueror"", and Dan Powell's ""Pieces"". Here's a quick track listing.1.We Will Rock You-Queen2.Low Rider-War3.Takin' Care of Business-B.T.O.4.Golden Years-David Bowie5.Crazy On You-Heart6.Further On Up the Road-Eric Clapton7.Get Ready-Rare Earth8.I Want to Take You Higher-Sly & The Family Stone9.The Boys Are Back In Town-Thin Lizzy10.One of Your Own-Carter Burwell(not really a song)11.We Are the Champions-Robbie Williams+Queen12.Pieces-Dan Powell13.Eye Conqueror-Third Eye BlindIf you like classic rock, then you'll love this soundtrack! Don't miss the hilarious movie either!"
4,Who would have thunk it?,"I've listened to these songs everyday while growing up and basically thought they have been played to death, until I saw this wonderful movie. Writer-director Brian Helgeland has definitely breathed new life into these classic songs, especially David Bowie's ""Golden Years,"" by meshing them into a story about knights in shining armor. I also enjoyed Carter Burwell's instrumental piece that is accompanied by dialogue from the movie as spoken by Paul Bettany. This movie and soundtrack is simply brilliant! Who would have thunk it?"
4,"More, more... MORE!","Puhleeeeze give as an album of all the other music we heard in the theatre (front to back.) How can I emphasize this enough? The currently released soundtrack is fab-Ah-lus, but... NOT ENOUGH! Now, don't forget -- we need ALL of it, just like it wuz!"
1,A true story?,"I have to agree with David on this one. I bought the book and just finished reading it. The most of the scams wouldn't work, and about half the book has nothing to do with gambling, just some dudes uninteresting life. Total waste of my time. There are definitely better books out there."
2,I hated it (sorry!),"I love Vegas and books about Vegas so it pains me to tell you that I truthfully hated this book. I was tempted to not even finish it, although I've never walked out on a book before.I found the writing style to be sort of... archaic, I guess. It sounds like it was written in the 50s, or by a guy who is in his 80s (which may be the case, I don't know).But primarily I disliked it because it simply cannot be a factual account. A few of the cheating methods he discussed are quite simply impossible. Even Madonna french-kissing Britney Spears at the craps table would not have been enough distraction to pull off what they supposedly did.Some of the side stories were interesting, but nowhere near enough to recommend this book."
4,Here's a taste of some electronic goth music,"Yes this album is one of Lycia's early recordings, and i think that the sound is downright impressive for a one man band to accomplish. The albums cover is fascinating but yet doesnt fit the music itself. I really like Lycia, but i dont really like thier early recordings. I like the later CDs that had the heavier walls of guitar synths, the deep drums and the more dramatic sound. Good album for you if you especially like more electronic ambient music."
5,romantic desert themes,"I have every album by Lycia but ""Ionia"" is one of their best.Listening to it brings beautiful visions of the desert to mind.Lycia's music always has the ability to inspire my soul with its atmospheric guitar sounds and Mike Van Port Fleets haunting whisper of a voice.The song ""desert"" on this album is my favorite."
4,Go Large,"I purchased three of these for working in my attic and crawl space during my home remodel. Thy Tyvek is light and breathable but it does tear pretty easily if you catch it on a protruding nail or something.I had tried the XL size from the home improvement store but it was much too small for me despite my typically wearing XL tee shirts. This XXXL size zips up easily and is just loose enough to allow me to move without stressing the seams of the coverall. I'm 5'-11"" and 275 lb."
4,Magic of the Celtic Gods and Goddesses,"If you are interested in Celtic traditions, this book has a lot of good information. It is very well presented and covers a wide variety of information on the Celtic Gods and Goddesses. It is only just over 200 pages, so you don't need to spend a lifetime going over the mnaterial. I think Carl McColman and Kathryn Hinds have done an excellent job of presenting this material, in a way that is easy to understand and appreciate."
3,Magic of the Celtic Gods & Goddesses (FOR WICCANS!),"The content about the Gods & Goddesses in this book was pretty good, really well referenced and heaps of recommendations for further reading, I'm not sure on the accuracy of all the facts, but it seemed like a really good primer. On the negative side, I think it really should have been called celtic gods & goddesses FOR WICCANS. The author really wrote from a Wiccan perspective and suggested ways to celebrate the wiccan festivals in regards to the gods and goddesses, that detracted somewhat from it for me. But if that's what you're after, then its a good book!"
4,Very Good Over-all Book On Ancient Celtic Beliefs,"I think this is a very good book on the over-all belief's of the ancient Celtic God & Goddesses, and many of their spiritual practices. I would recommend this book as a good introduction to this subject, it is well researched. Check out the other reviews to get a better well-rounded opinion of it."
5,A superb guide to avoiding breaches of tact around Japanese,"Written by a third-generation Japanese American, being Japanese American: A JA Sourcebook for Nikkei, Hapa... & Their Friends is a straightforward introduction to the history of Japanese Americans, including the legacy of the American government's forced internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and basic Japanese culture, customs, and etiquette. An especial note reflects on the how the high rate of mixed-race marriage has and continues to affect the Japanese-American community. Being Japanese American a superb guide to avoiding breaches of tact around Japanese friends, family, or visitors, regardless of one's own ethnic heritage or background, and is also chock-full of helpful ways to embrace, preserve, and treasure one's cultural identity."
5,Georgeous and Practical,"So many garden tools are the same old design, well not this line from Katie Brown. The sleek silver handle is actually pretty comfortable for gardening and looks very nice. I havent had any wear issues yet (although I have only had it a few months). Overall I think that this is a beautiful line for any gardener to get. I expect that it should stand up well to the wear and tear of my flower beds for a couple seasons."
1,Cheap,Not worth the money! Thin plastic! The plastic is like blister packaging that you buy the rolling stock in! Not a show piece at all!
4,Documented and thoughtful,"This book made me discover knowledge management. It is very well documented, very thougthful, easy to read... An excellent starting point."
4,Surprised the HELL out of me!,Didn't expect this book to be this good. I couldn't put it down and read it in a day.I would of given it 5 stars but the main character was a little to much of a baby for my taste.
2,"Disappointing, though slightly redeeming at the end","Speed of Darkness is one of the most original Starcraft novels to date, keeping its focus more on ""new"" characters rather than following the heroes of the Starcraft computer game. Yet even with the fresh cast, the book sufferes from so many sci-fi cliches and overused plotlines that it does not feel original. Combine that with stereotypical characters and a protagonist most readers won't like (or identify with) throughout most of the novel and you've got a book that, in my opinion, isn't worth reading.Still, the last ""scene"" of the book is well done, and will give hardcore fans a brief reprieve from the feeling that they've wasted their money. It is not, however, good enough for me to recommend this book to anyone I know (and like)."
2,umm..,"The novel was a fast read. And it does capture some of the starcraft world and its brutality. The story to me seemed too thin, though there are dramatic elements."
1,Not the real Sleep of Reason,"Look for Washington DC's Sleep of Reason which released an album on TOP records in 1988. I have found copies of their debut record ""Building 27"" on Amazon and in used record stores. Worth the effort tracking this down. Features ex-members of Minor Threat and Top 40 Synth-Pop band Ampersand. Melodic power-pop infected with progressive musicianship and honed by a razor-edge (not straight-edge) harDCore undercurrent. Clearly a band ahead of its time. Not sure why they broke up. Former members have gone on to produce Tool and Dag Nasty among others."
2,Nice but not solid,"Very nice set of tools, but the blades are way too fragile and break up so easily, one wonders if they're glass or metal. Admittedly their very small size and hence thinness are bound to make them delicate, but I feel this is way too much. Not recommended."
5,Great quality,I've owned this item for several years now and it looks and preforms like the day I bought it. Will probably be passed down to one of the boys!
1,bad,I used it for the first time and the quality of the product is less than sub standard!!!!!I do not know if it is worth the trouble to return it or not.
3,Not bad for an old classic,"I never played the original, but this ""newer"" version is fun. The only downside is that even though there is a save option it only saves the money and items you have earned, not your progress in the story. Other than that, it has nice RPG elements (buying food and items at stores), and goofy dialogue. A must for old school gamers."
2,nothing like original,"i bought this game on the assumption that it was going to be indentical to the original. NOPE!the techniques bought are difficult to perform.if anybody remembers how the acro circus worked, it was like ryan or alex would jump and spin, hit the enemy and you could either kick or punch them. in this gba version, alex/ryan just spins and spins like a bowling ball! i mean seriously you can spin your way to the end of the game. i beat the game once like that.this game doesn't even play like the original. atlus tweaked this game too much for my taste. if you had good feelings about the original NES game, i don't recommend playing this one. i feel really gipped about buying it."
5,One Awesome Cookbook!,This is one awesome cookbook! Recipes are easy to follow. Turn very inexpensive cuts of meat into very tasty dishes. This is one very interesting book either for the recipe content or the Mahalia Jackson collection. Includes pics of Mahalia preparing these tasty recipes in her kitchen. Sure to please.
2,Remarkable legal case,"This book is an extraordinary ""biography"" of Warren Spahn that fictionalized him into a war hero. Spahn sued to clear his name. In Spahn v. Julian Messner, Inc., one Judge Keating said that the book contained ""dramatization, imagined dialogue, manipulated chronologies, and fictionalization of events"" and that it ""publicizes areas of Warren Spahn's personal and private life, albeit inaccurate and distorted, and consists of a host, a preponderant percentage, of factual errors, distortions, and fanciful passages.""Wow! I can't believe this book is still around. I can't exactly recommend this phony biography, but it might be worth checking out if you are a fan of law, history, lies, or Warren Spahn.P.S. Spahn won his case."
3,Books recipes very disappointing,"I would recommend this book to those who are newly diagnosed with Candida. There is a lot of information they can glean from it. However, I find information varies from book to book so I would say not to take all that is there as the gospel truth.I was so disappointed with the recipes. They did not sound appealing to me and contained a number of ingredients I never heard of and don't keep in my kitchen."
2,Not the best on the subject,"I would expect a book on Candida yeast to talk about the importance to probiotics. This book didn't even barely touch on the subject. There are things that people NEED to know (e.g. probiotics can help kill yeast, but can also make the problem worse initially due to the ""die off effect"").Also, I was trying to figure out if brewer's yeast is a problem with candida yeast, and only one place does it touch on it. That sentence basically says that cigarettes and brewers yeast are bad. No explanation as to why...Get a different book on the subject."
5,My Life Saver,"This is the best book on candida I have seen on the market. When I learned that I had candida I read what seemed to be every book on the subject and this one is by far the best. It has everything that you need to know on cause and treatment. The recipes are great, enjoyable and easy. I can't say enough about this book, it made my life much easier."
3,Disappointing,"Zoltan Rona, the co-author of this book, has written online some excellent articles on Candida. However, this book is not much more than a grocery list of supplements and a reiteration of diet hints that is fairly common knowledge. For me, there was not any new or interesting information. The book may proove useful as a first time read for someone who has no prior knowledge of Candida Albicans or what to do about it."
3,Comprehensive and useful but not the ultimate Truth,"Useful info on dealing with chronic systemic yeast infections. Lots of specifics, such as which foods are ""bad,"" which are controversial (and how one might deal with them) and which are ""good."" There are also ""phases"" to the diet, depending on your condition and what point you're at in treating it; suggestions for specific candida symptoms (lack of energy, ""brain fuzz,"" depression and so on); and plenty of recipes.As someone with a chronic systemic infection, I'm finding this a useful resource. Some of the assertions might be taken with a grain of salt, such as candida treatments being good for everything from depression to cancer. Also, in my experience, one trick to sticking with a low-yeast diet is to cheat occasionally so one doesn't feel too deprived. That's contrary to the authors' instructions in this book, but my complementary-medicine-loving MD agrees with me on it!"
3,Complete Candida Yeast Guidebook has awful recipes,"While the book was very informative, the recipes are awful and the timing on baking is always wrong. Plus the ingredients are impossible to find."
3,Complete Candida Yeast Guidebook,The book is good but the beginning is long and drawn out. It takes too long to get to want I was wanting to know.
2,???,"I should have ordered the book ""Eating Your Way To Good Health.""This book is informative, but I did not find it helpful, as it does not coincide with what my Dr says I can eat on this diet."
1,Don't bother with this garbage,"This book is just another 'low fat/high carb is the way to go' and a vegetarian diet is the best for everyone piece of junk.The authors have little nutritional knowledge and, at one point, advise a vegetable fast for diabetics!Very poor quality book and I advise you to avoid it."
2,Not well organized or convincing,"Basic information is buried under a load of extra, and often extraneous, information, and even then the information is often incomplete, or conflicts with advice given elsewhere with no explanation as to why. The authors seem to be pushing agendas that go far beyond candida management."
4,Recipes are too huge,"The recipes in this book are tasty but the number of servings varies crazily--some recipes serve 2, some serve 8-10. Right next to each other! This happens all through the book, and it's the only thing I don't like about it. It's easy to multiply up to double a recipe but hard to divide it. I wish the authors would have made little recipes, as a diet like this will often just be for little ol' you and not a whole party of people. Otherwise an excellent book."
5,titles included,"Hope this is helpful!!The Mystery WheelBusytown Blue-BottomsThe Sticky Stuff MysteryUp, Up and AwayWhere's Junior?There Might Be Giants"
4,Great value and kids love it!,"This movie was very inexpensive and our children really enjoy all the episodes, it is perfect for those long car rides."
4,nice show,My little one loves busytown and this was a great show. you cannot beat it for the price and this is one of the few kids shows that does not have any bad guys or violence in them
1,Short lifespan,"My son loved it, but it worked only 3 times all in all. This toys has a very short lifespan."
2,Too simplistic even for most kids,"I have quite a collection of books on cryptology, including kid's books. But this one is really for the younger crowd. Many kid's books, such as the classic Herbert Zim ""Codes and Secret Writing"" actually have some great info. Zim's book, for instance has a large section on invisible inks,...But this book really just touches on the subjects it mentions. This would be more acceptable if the book were less expensive, but at the current price, you'd be better off finding a copy of Zim's book. . .there's a few out there."
4,Heavenly noise,"Recipe for ""Xuvetyn"": Take the mellower tracks from My Bloody Valentine's ""Loveless"" and put them in a blender with Cocteau Twins' ""Victorialand"" (the so-called ""ambient album""). Add a handful of psychedelic mushrooms and puree until smooth. Serve chilled.This really is a nice album; though MBV is an obvious point of reference, ""Xuvetyn"" doesn't feel derivative. I hear elements of shoegazer, ambient, psychedelia, tasteful goth (yes, there is such a thing!), and space rock, but Lovesliescrushing manage to avoid cliché (despite my tongue-in-cheek recipe).Billowing clouds of heavenly noise, silken but indecipherable female vocals, wordless songs of love and heartbreak, crescendos that sound like God breaking down into tears...it gets REALLY noisy at times, even more so than ""Loveless"", but it's a blissful sort of noise. There are no drums, no hooks, no overt ""message"" - just rich textures and gorgeous melodies. And really, that's all you need."
2,Rusted shortly after purchase,"I originally purchased this colander to actually use. I was never happy with how the colander seemed to hold a small amount of water unless you shook it since it doesn't have an adequate amount of drain holes on the bottom. After a few uses, the paint started flaking off in large chunks on the bottom of the colander. The exposed areas quickly rusted. Now it is sitting on top of my cabinets as a decoration as I would never put something I was going to eat in it. I am very disappointed that this colander had such a short useful life."
4,Nab End Review,"As a British ex-pat with a Yorkshire childhood, I found the book well written and containing a great deal of relevant North Country social history (1916 to 1933). The only distractions were the frequently used Americanism, sidewalk (pavement)and while the book emphasized a lack of education for working class children generalizations such as,""Every Lancashire child know that Chester means the site of a Roman Camp."" The word ""Charabanc"" meaning a tour bus, was, and is, commonly used in the UK. The author spelled the word ""Sharabang"" (which is how the word sounds)to describe the same vehicle. I have been unable to find the word sharabang in the Oxford dictionary. These were minor irritants in an otherwise fascinating family history."
3,Not An Identical Replacement,"The activated carbon filter pack that comes with this OEM replacement set contains 54% less activated carbon (15 oz, vs 27 oz) than the filter that originally came with the FP-N60CX. The box is also insufficiently rigid enough to protect the filter, so even if the box appears intact, the HEPA filter may be damaged if it's roughly handled."
1,Finish all in 1 Tabs- Good Idea* Bad performance,The tablet idea sounds good and is convenient. Too bad they dont clean well.I thought something was wrong with my dishwasher so we used our tried and true powder again and immediately everything was clean and sparkly again.I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.
4,"Works well, thoroughly dissolves","I think my review title says it all. These seem to do a good job, in conjunction with my dishwasher, to get the dishes clean without water marks. Thumbs up."
2,"Pésima edición, lástimo para un excelente libro","La obra es excelente, desde el punto de vista de la orientación y la integración de diferentes enfoques disciplinarios y metodológicos.La edición parece es peor que una fotocopia de mala calidad, no vale la pena gastar en el libro. Desmerecen por completo los editores a la calidad de esta obra. Y el precio no justifica la mala impresión."
4,A wonderful guide,"The book really introduces you to a world of methods and ways of thnking policy analysis, that you can later explore more in depth on your own. It would only be good to have more references to recent publications, since most of them are to works back in the 70s and even beyond that."
4,"Spooky, atmospheric, music ideal for dark & stormy nights","Death House is very much an atypical Attrition release. Originally recorded as a background cassette to the Night of the Living Dead based role playing game Death House (the This.. was added to the title when it got a CD release), the game was never released (shame, as it was very playable) but the music fortunately was. Orginally a cassette only release on seminal UK label Adventures in Reality, it was later re-issued on Seattle label Projeckt.The CD itself consists of two long analogue electronic tracks, Crawling and Dead of night (originally separate sides of the cassette release). Both are broody and dark, building the tension up slowly & remisiscent in places of SPK circa Information Overload Unit. The undercurrent of unease lingers long after the CD has finished.Certainly music to read horror fiction to and those into DnD or Resident Evil style games would do well to check this one out."
1,It sucked,"I read the first ten pages and quit because I could not understand one word of it and it was very, very boring."
1,Not worth it!,"As a student, I attempted to read this book but found it very difficult. I could never ""get"" into it, and I thought my teacher was kidding when she gave us an essay test. I just don't think it was good at all!!"
3,"Intriguing, but I need help to understand it!","Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" was boring in some parts, and rather confusing at times, because sometimes I had to read ahead to comprehend what was going on early in the book. However, it seems to be full of symbolism and morals, yet I can't figure out what they are. I enjoyed the book, as I did Conrad's style and diction, but if anyone could help me out with the analysis of it I would appreciate it! I have an essay to write about it, various topics accepted by my professor, but I really need help understanding it. If anyone could help me out, email me at RyanKlesko@aol.com. I would love to hear from anyone who even thinks they might possibly have a clue about this book. Thanks!"
5,The only suntan lotion I use,"I started using Australian Gold in 1998 when I went on a cruise with my family. Of course the one thing we forgot was suntan lotion, so we bought some on the ship. This lotion is excellent, and smells just amazing. Whenever I use it, my mind goes right back to the Caribbean. It doesn't feel greasy at all, and it rubs right in. I only wish they made it in SPF 50."
4,Ancient Ideas of Fairness,"I can understand how some readers, if unfamiliar witht he Celtic world and inparticular the Brehon Laws of Ireland might find it a little hard to follow the more intricate parts but the content is well arranged and well explained and the worth of these ancient codes, with their emphasis on solutions that are both practically and spiritually satisfying, provides a fascinating insight into an ancient society."
3,Please ignore the above ignorant!,"As one of the most traditional legal codes in the Western World, Brehon Laws should be understood before being criticized... it is rather difficult (if not impossible) to try and make sense of a code of laws that has been orally preserved since Celtic days in Ireland if one has no idea of what this is about..."
4,"Decent book to have for the price, but not very extensive.","This book goes into the features available with each of the cameras, but doesn't teach you anything that you wouldn't already know from reading the camera's manual. It is a decent reference to have when comparing each of the camera's. I've read my copy and haven't touched it since though. There is a (very) short section about the history of Pentax."
2,Not very useful.,Nothing more than you can get from manufacturer's literature. A comparison of features for the various models.
2,Does not fit with Samatha and Nellie's friendship at all,"In this book parts of it could be the basis for a good story but then a rift develops between Samantha and Nellie and the ""rift"" does not make any sense at all! Samantha would never treat her friend Nellie like that and Nellie would never treat Samantha like that - actually there is no reason for the rift to be there at all - it is so weird! This rift goes on and on and is the basis for the developing story and then in the blink of an eye it is all talked over and gone. It seems a poor choice as a basis for the story to me. A disapointment as it leaves a negative feeling about their friendship that appeared to be so deep and special at the beginning."
4,Alienation and meaning,"This is the first, but certainly not the last, book by Ivan Klima I have read. The divorced woman, estranged from father, not understanding her teenage daughter, young lover book blurb lead to very low expectations. Instead I discovered a well-written, thought-provoking book that explores, among other things, the role of religion in providing meaning. While some of this theme relates back to childhood experience of ""church"" without understanding of the ritual, some relates to using belief as the motivating force in drug rehabilitation and some relates to politics as a substitute for religion. Placed in a world in transition - WWII, Communism and post-communist - the setting permits the plot to explore a variety of views and a variety of ways to adjust to the changes views. If you like thought-provoking novels, this is for you."
4,Princess,Loved this movie. The acting was great. I liked the idea of someone loving another person enough to go thru everything she did.
1,NOT compatible with Mac OS,"I bought this camera believing the manufacturers' marketing information that it is compatible with the Mac OS. Pretec has now admitted that the Mac drivers for the DC-1500 have not been released, and that there are no plans to release them. DON'T BUY FROM MANUFACTURERS THAT MISREPRESENT THE CAPABILITIES OF THEIR PRODUCTS! If they misrepresent something as basic as this, then how can any other product claims be believed?"
5,Excellent Songbook!,"This is a great songbook from the Easy Guitar family it includes many well renowned songs. It contains simple melody with musical notations,lyrics,chord diagrams, strumming & picking patterns. If your into guitar and are at beginning to intermediate level this a must to have."
5,A True Classic,"My jaw dropped when I listened to this CD for the first time. This is truly an instant classic of hard rock. This group from Sweden is going where no other band is these days, mixing heavy riffs with progressive influences to create a totally unique stoner sound. Check out ""Vipera Barus,"" ""K,"" and ""The So-called 4th Sect"" to hear what I mean. My favorite track, though, is ""What Happened in Antioch?"" If you like what you hear, buy this CD, then petition for an American tour!!!"
1,Tape or DVD? It's a tape.,"This comes up on the DVD search. I thought it was copied straight from the VHS onto a DVD (and that was fine with me since it was much cheaper), since it says underneath that the format is DVD and the picture is of a DVD. Nope. It's a tape. Boo hoo! Sending it back and paying more for the real deal."
5,"Forget Pilates, Callanetics is the best.........PERIOD!!!","I started doing callentics when I was 16 with my moms book. I have scoliosis and it has never botherd my back. Then I bought the tapes and loved it even more! Super callanetics is my favorite because it includes more of the excersizes that are found in the book and you get faster results.Just watching the tape would fool you, youd never guesse how sore these movements make you or what kind of results you will get. I have done yoga and the series of pilates tapes from ""the method"" and to be honest they dont even come close. I did the method tapes for 2 years and never saw the results that I get from 2 weeks of callanetics! Youll still want to do some form of cardio to burn fat, but you will get smaller and trimmer if you do this alone.If you want to reshape your body and increase your flexibility then callanetics is the workout for you. You wont be dissapointed."
2,It's not the best read,"As a wiccan I've been looking for information on Dark Moon magic for an upcoming ritual i'm about to perform. I found this book on a shelf in a library and thought, ""awesome, this might give me all the information i need."" wrong. gail wood has a few good tips that I had to find by scanning through quickly but overall this book is a bomb. she should have titled it ""dark moon meditations"" because that's all it is. every chapter has a different meditation for the dark moon in each zodiac sign, which is okay but when you're looking for actual rituals this book doesn't even cover much. so far i've only found the books by dj conway ""moon magick"" helpful in utilizing any form of moon magick."
2,Sold as New,"The book was sold as ""new."" It wasn't. It had writing in it. I contacted the seller and heard nothing back."
5,it is very good,it works and i love it and my cat stays away from it now so i am very happy with it thank you so much for checking back with me
2,Anticlimax,"This is an excellent example of a book that starts great and sort of fizzles into an uninteresting ending. True, this was an account of actual events but I think that Mr. Follain should have sought a more intiguing story to write about.The book was not a total waste since it offered a few peaks into Vatican life."
3,a pleasant change,"In that it gives a look at some other murders outside of the mysterious death of John Paul I, this is a refreshing book. Yet, since it does not invlove a Pope it is likely to suffer unfairly from less interest. I recommend you not pass it up. An alternative is Lucien Gregoire's ""Murder in the Vatican"" which takes one on a methodical imvestigation of the murder of eight men which combination was the leadership of the progressive movement in Church - including the 'murders' of John Paul I and Paul VI. That all of these men died mysteriously within a few months of each other itself would arouse ones suspicions - but Gregoire offers much more than just that. I would recommend you buy these books as a package."
3,The Truth is not so interesting,"A good and thorough job of investigative reporting but unfortunately for the author and the reader it ends where it begins. There's always a ""story"" behind a murder/suicide but this one turns out to be not very interesting. The fact that it took place in the Vatican created the headlines but beyond that its not much of a story although there are a lot of great characters. There was no real cover-up on the part of the Vatican except for them not being more open about what the motivation for the event might have been.No doubt that plenty of people around the Vatican will not like to see their names publicized around this event, but Vatican intrigue is as old as the papacy.Kudos to the author for showing great determination in tracking people down and getting into the Vatican. It's just too bad he had to conclude that it was what it appeared to be from the beginning."
3,It's a promise unfulfilled.,"This book starts out really promising. Unfortunately it's only a promise unfulfilled. Even the title hints at some explosive secret. Unfortunately in a city filled with secrets it seems he found the only boring one. *Spoiler Alert* He found that in a city of men there might be *gasp* homosexuals. After that discovery it's all downhill. I had to force myself to read the last half of the book after that it was obvious nothing more shocking was to be had. It's not that it's poorly written, it isn't(in fact I'll be buying his book on Carlos the Jackal). I like the writing style it's just that it should have made a long news magazine article not a full length book."
4,Behind the Vatican murders,"The strength of John Follain's book, based on his four-year investigation, is that we end up with a firm understanding of why Tornay did it. City of Secrets is both superb journalism and an outstanding example of forensic psychology.Secondhand investigations of sensational crimes are often nothing more than instant books. However, Follain not only took the time to contribute something of worth to the canon of crime journalism but also exposed weaknesses in the Vatican that need addressing. In this case it is the fact that the Swiss Guard, supposedly responsible for protecting the Pope, are nothing more than toy soldiers -- Dennis Chute, The Edmonton Journal"
3,Lethal Skies II,"I found this game fun, however not as fun as the Ace Combat series of games. In the Ace Combat games, flight, takeoffs, landings, and combat are fairly simple and very stable. Flight and combat in Lethal Skies II was unstable and complicated. I also prefer the Strangereal world of Ace Combat, whereas the Lethal Skies take place on this earth without a specific year, and the world has been devastated by natural disasters. The gameplay of Ace Combat is better, as well as the soundtrack and storyline. However, I did not find Lethal Skies to have such qualities. The soundtrack of Lethal Skies II was all rock music, as compared to the orchestra of Ace Combat. In conclusion Lethal Skies II is a fun game, but mediocre in comparison with Ace Combat."
4,"Try This One On The ""HARD"" Mode And Then Talk!","One fun game. One challenging game. Try this one with the hardest setting and see how long it takes to finish the missions!! It may not compare to the Ace Combat series visually, but it has a lot to offer! Highly Recommended!"
2,"Help, I've fallen in the Well and I can't get out!","I like the music of Steve Roach, but this CD I found derivative of an earlier Roach CD called The Magnificent Void. The tracks on Well of Souls are hardly dissimilar, and as much as I like some drone and repetition, this CD is quite boring. Try Desert Solitaire or World's Edge."
4,Good amp depending on your tastes,"I had this amp for at least a year and a half before selling it and I must say it was a pleasure to own. It is extremely well put together, never had a problem with it. Every feature of this thing is beautiful save one, It didn't quite have enough volume for me. If you are playing for less then 200 people in a big room then this is fine volume wise, but it just doesn't have the power to match up against a Marshall half stack and a heavy handed drummer.On the other hand, if you are playing smaller shows; bars, coffee shops, churches, other small venues, look no further. This amp has excellent tone and if you need an amp to record with I would especially recommend this.Overall: Great amp all around, awesome tone and functions, a little weak on volume in loud situations.Solution if you still want this high quality product but need more volume, MAG 600 or ABM 575."
4,Excellent presentation of this key method of export finance,"Our consulting staff considers this book to be one of our most valuable resources when clients ask us about receiving accelerated payment for their export sales. We recommend this book for financial and marketing executives, especially those with smaller companies that have a need for a continual cash flow. John R. Jagoe, Director, Export Institute."
5,Ken Burns Baseball - Second Inning,"Like all the innings in the Ken Burns Baseball Series, it is fantastic. I have been a life-long baseball fan and every one of this DVDs prior to the 1970s makes me wish I could go back in time and see the game in those different stages of growth. Can you image paying 25 or 50 cents to sit in your favorite stadium now with five cent programs and 10 cent sodas."
1,subtitled,might be worth watching if they come ip with a dubbed version. Until they do if i want to read I will read a book
4,Good but lacking,"I am pretty far into this anime set as of writing this. The story is great so far, but I have to give only 4 stars for two reasons. One is the artifacting on the solid colors throughout the animation. It usually isn't a big enough deal for me to write about it or give a lower rating, but it really shows on this particular blu-ray more than others I have watched recently. The only other thing that bugs me are the voice acting with face Irish accents. Words are not pronounced the same way consistently and it gets a little annoying. Both of those are minor complaints and nothing that would keep me from purchasing it had I known about them beforehand. I think regular accents would have been just fine since the story can hold its own and all of the non-accented voices are fine. If you like good characters and a good story, pick it up. You will enjoy it."
1,"""Elevator music""","This is a dreadful CD. ""Elevator music"", ""piped music"", ""mall music"" or ""airplane music"" are terms that come to mind. To think that this violinist placed high in the Tchaikovsky Competition, albeit MANY years ago! What caused this decline down a slippery slope? What will the end be? Horrible to contemplate."
4,"Great for parents, good for kids","I've enjoyed the entire Baby Signs series by Kim Votry. I find the drawings of the signs and the visual maps for each one to be clear and understandable. My little one, however, isn't as taken with the books; many pages are too monochromatic and don't keep her as engaged as books with more vibrant colors. That said, I would recommend this entire series to parents who want to learn sign language for objects, colors, and activities that they will encounter on a regular basis with their children."
4,I'm Just Guessing,"I'm just guessing, but i think that maybe this is just a re-do of the PS1 game, The Mummy, and in that case, The Mummy eas a really good game, without the fact that it had horrible graphics and the words didn't go with the mouth. Other than that, I can't wait for it to come out."
4,Interesting pre-code film,"I quite enjoyed this film - it's an interesting pre-code that was released about 6 weeks before enforcement of the production code. Loretta Young's acting is pretty good but Cary Grant is kind of dull - definitely not his best role. Some of the pre-code plot elements in this film include Loretta Young's unspecified ""profession"" and lifestyle that involves men and clothes and some of the rather risque shots of Loretta in her underwear. I think the release of this pre-code movie, which was previously unavailable, is to be applauded."
3,neat pre-code melodrama,"""Born to be Bad"", made by Twentieth Century Pictures before they merged with Fox, is a fast moving pre-code melodrama possibly made as Daryl F. Zanuck's response to Warner's ""Baby Face"" and MGM's ""Red Headed Woman"". The interest in the film today is that Loretta Young plays against type as a promiscuous dame with an illegitimate son whom she raises to defy any sort of authority. Young is on record as loathing the film, not the least for the morals, or lack of, which the film depicts. However, that judgement ignores that here is the sexy radiant Young playing a tough broad very convincingly. A wooden Cary Grant plays opposite her.The print is OK and there are no extras. The DVD is quite expensive and only worth seeing for Young."
4,Born to be Bad,"Born to be Bad concerns a married couple who after several years, find that they cannot have children. Enter Loretta Young, a young, beautiful, unmarried, unprincipled woman who has a child. She agrees to the adoption. Then when she later visits her in Cary's home, she decides she would like to replace his wife. This is where the plot thickens. I was a bit disappointed in Cary Grant. His behavior early in the film didn't prepare me for his very strong reactions exhibited later."
4,Tiny scale,This is a hand calculator sized scale. The pan is about six Cheerios by six Cheerios large before flaring up at an angle. I've only had for a short time but so far it's working good. The scale uses disc batteries and not normal AAA's or AA's.
2,Worked great then broke,"It worked great for a few months, perfect for fine measurements like a few grams of salt or yeast. Now the display reads ""oUt2"" and won't reset. Tried new batteries, no luck. It wasn't dropped or mishandled -- I think the construction is cheap so I would rate it as overpriced."
5,Miracle!,"This is an unbelievable cd.It breaks all beariers there is between the eastern and the western music system,this album is a true gold,masterful playing and beautiful composition."
5,Journey to Ultimate Spirituality--A Blueprint,"Journey to Ultimate Spirituality is truly a blueprint for living in and from one's heart. The concepts presented are advanced and require more than one reading for complete understanding. The format of Journey is such that a book study group, either large or small, would benefit greatly . Jackie Woods presents this blueprint for being on a spiritual growth path based on more than 25 years of experience as a Teacher and Healer. Journey is a ""must read"" for any serious student of spiritual growth."
2,repetitive and way too long,This Cd tends to become boring very quickly as it is repetitive and starts to sound the same in just a few tracks into it. I could only recomemd this for sleep music.
5,A Must Have For Every Photoshop User,"For anyone who uses Photoshop in graphic design and or to correct or edit their precious photos, this book is a must have in your library of reference materials. It takes the mystery out of all those scary, misused, underused and never used filters in Photoshop by clearly showing and explaining how to use them and when to use them. This is one fantastic book."
1,She should be ashamed of herself,"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. This ""mother"" should be ashamed of herself. So she didn't like being pregnant, so what. I saw her interviewed on a televisions how and she was saying how she hated being pregnant because she couldn't go out anymore and got fat and that ""soon after"" giving birth she started going out again to try to get her old life back. News flash, you'll never have your old life back, you're a mother now. Why have a baby (even if it was an accident) if you're just going to keep going out and get a nanny to watch the baby? How about talking about the joys your new baby has brought you? Has your new baby brought you no joy? What's the point of scaring other first time moms with your nonsense about how horrible it was being pregnant, but giving no real reasons why other than you got fat. WAH WAH WAH! If you didn't want to get pregnant, you should have kept your pants on! She's a disgrace!"
5,Great Read from man's perspective!,"Rebebcca Eckler saved my marriage. Seriously. I bought my newly pregnant wife Knocked Up, as a gift one day. She had been so miserably and moodey and I thought something was seriously wrong with her. My wife would constantly quote this book to me. Everything the author was going through and feeling so was my wife. It was great to see her less stressed out after reading Knocked up. I'm going to buy this book for all my guy friends when their wives get pregant. It's a life and marriage-saver for anyone going through the emotional rollercoaster ride with a pregnant spouse. I can't reccommend this book highly enough. My wife plans to send Rebecca Eckler a thank you card - it changed the way she thought so much. Thank You!"
1,Selfishness at its Finest,"I am so glad this woman was not MY mother. Her book may be considered funny by some, but I found it to be the ultimate in what our society has become. SELFISH! Her baby is nothing more than an inconvenience to her life. She even scheduled a C-Section for her delivery...not because of medical reasons, but because of HER SCHEDULE! We have become a society where children are not considered the blessings they are, but merely accessories to our wardrobe or mistakes happening on a drunken night. This book is evidence of that."
1,Women like this should not be mothers,"Sorry to be extreme, but after dealing with infertility for two years I'm finally pregnant thanks to IVF. I am disgusted by her obsession with her thinness ( I was a size 6 when fertility treatments started two years ago - now I'm a size 10 or so and wouldn't trade it for anything because now I get to be a mommie). Her smoking was disgusting...Her declaration to ""cram"" for all her baby knowledge was appalling. What an idiot - I rarely feel so strongly about a book but this one pushed me over the edge. What an insult to pregnancy and the life process. I'm throwing it away..."
1,TRASH,"A stupid, stupid woman who puts her own needs first at every turn. This, she thinks, is ""hip"" motherhood. One for the trash basket."
1,Extremely offensive to all mothers,"I bought this book, being a new mom, looking for some humor and insight from another 20-something. I have not been more sorry to have spent money on anything in a VERY long time. Had this book been fiction (as I orginally thought) it may have had some redeeming qualities. The fact that it is reality is abominable. To read about someone knowingly harming their unborn child in such blatant ways is terrible. I agree that no one should support this woman and feed into her vanity. I intend to return this book and tell everyone I know not to read it."
3,"Annoying, but I couldn't put it down.","Rebecca Eckler is easy to hate, and definitely annoying! How many times did she have to mention how skinny she was before getting pregnant? It wouldn't be over-the-top to say that this book is nothing but one long ""I'm so fat!"" rant. Yet, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what happened when the baby was born, but thats the only reason I finished it, really."
4,A good laugh,"I loved this book. I think it appeals to the shallow side of finding out your pregnant, and touches on subjects that some mothers to be may feel guilty thinking or talking about. Also, any feelings you've had this author's are bound to be more outrageous. I think this would appeal to someone with a first pregnancy, since they are taking that step from their selfish life to a more selfless existence. It is also definitely more for readers that may have more of a cosmopolitan lifestyle, atleast pre pregnancy! This book also gives you a nice comic relief from reading all your pregnancy do's and don't books! Pregnancy is scary enough without being able to have a few laughs about it!"
3,CLAIMS TO BE THE IDEA BEHIND THE MOVIE?,"I have read this book and have seen the new movie with the same title. While the general premise (of a an unplanned pregnancy) does bear some similarity, there is no basis for the lawsuit that the author has filed against the creative team behind the Knocked-Up movie. The similarity essentially stops with the title. The circumstance and context of the unplanned pregnancy are totally different as is the ensuing plot. The book, however, makes for a fun read if you like pretentious entitled characters. I would encourage you to read the book and see the movie and make a determination of your own. This is as foolish a lawsuit as the one filed against George Harrison some 30 years ago over the song ""My Sweet Lord"", which he sadly lost."
2,"She's Honest, And Still Unlikable","Selfish is a word that quickly comes to mind as a good way to describe Rebecca Eckler. She's not a bad writer or storyteller, but she really paints herself into a corner here and makes herself almost impossible to like. She is self-oriented at a time when some thought might best be given to her child's welfare, and yes, as everyone surely noticed, she smoked during her pregnancy. This woman needs to mature. She likes to think she is a cool person, a woman in touch with the scene and one of those who defines her era, but I found her deluded and irresponsible through and through. Where was the deep maternal side to her? Her baby seemed to represent an annoying interruption to her ""life of amazing hipness"". If she is in any way a self-created role model wanna-be, then she adds to my fears for the future."
1,Please Do Not Buy this Book!!!,"I was quite looking forward to this book as I read Ms.Ecklers columns on a regular basis. I'm also a new mother so I thought this might be timely and interesting. I could not be more wrong. Yes, Ms. Eckler can write, no doubt about that. But the reason I found this book a waste of time and money was that the main character (her) is a person who is vain, selfish and shallow. I think we are supposed to like and be sympathetic with her but by the end of the book I detested her. This is not a person I would want to be friends with. One thing is very clear - the size of her behind is more important to her than her child. Her Fiance, family, Cute single guy,her friends, nanny and night nurse exist only to serve her needs. Don't buy this book and stroke her ego and make it any larger than it is. I never write reviews but in this case I felt compelled to not let anyone waste their money!"
1,Perfect book if you're worried you'll be a bad mother- you can't be worse than her!,"This book is only good if you are a selfish narcissistic self absorbed person who wants to feel like you are justified in being that way, or if you're worried you're going to be a bad mother. After reading this book, you will be reassured that you cannot possibly be worse than her! There are some funny moments, especially in the 'first trimester', but after that one gets tired of reading about how her 100 pound frame has gained weight and how she finds it insulting that people tell her ""It's nice to see your plate full."""
1,Awful!!!!,I would also rate with less than one star. I've never read a book that made me angry as I read it. She's ridiculous and the book was a waste of money and time.
1,Just depressed my wife,I thought this would be a funny book to get my wife as we discussed kids. It just depressed her and she couldn't even finish it.
4,Knocked Up,"Being that I am pregnant, I wantd to a good laugh or at least something light about pregnancy. The book kept me entertained. I found it odd how completely clueless and selfish the author was about her own pregnancy but enjoyed how open and honest she was about her experiences. I think this is worth a read if you are pregnant. If anything, you'll feel like your doing or did a great job at protecting your baby."
1,was not what I expected,"i did not know it would be this tiny little pocket book, it is hard to read. plus the translation is not that great."
5,Horray for Super-GALS!!!!,"OMG! I love this show! It's really cute, fun and addicting! It's the kinda anime that doesn't have you bored and you watch it over and over. For those who are into shojo anime, THIS is so for you. And BTW, they ARE coming out with the second season box!! [eps 26-52] Yay! I cant wait!"
3,Somethin's missing...,"While the show is just GREAT ( I<3 Japanese gals or ""gyaru""...), they cut the special features! Wah??? Part of the delight of this seires was ADV's ""Super Gals Explain it All!"" I miss!Also, we STILL don't have ALL the eps in America. Oh well, this is the cheapest, most complete, leagal collection you're gonna find in America."
4,GALS just wanna have FUN,"I adore this anime, it's funny, smart and just so cute. The dub is also excellent with great voice actors like Luci Christian and Chris Patton(both from FMP. The whole Shibuya scene is quite realistic. I know since I've been there. Ran, Miyu, and Aya are just so spunky and funny. I can't wait for the next season."
5,Vintage Gigster at his Finest,What a thrill ride! Maynard is blowing like crazy on these tunes. This is a must for every Maynard Ferguson fan as well as any aspiring young musicians. It's amazing to hear what can actually be done with a trumpet. I never get tired of this CD.
4,Best CD of all the October 21st releases!!!,"When lead guitarist Steve Karsch was experiencing a little musician's block while composing this album, he consulted with Pantera lead man Phil Anselmo, and this album's course was changed forever. I read somewhere that Karsch works out for two hours prior to going on stage just to ""get in the mood"" and ""smack the fans with my fists"". Be sure to check out Can't Drink Enough to Get Drunk Anymore, Mood Ring, and Spaceships.Tip for listening: Place album in car. Turn up loud. Take off shirt. Tweak your nips at the other cars."
3,Really Hard Puzzle,"I've had this puzzle for about 3-4 months now, and I've only assembled the edge pieces and a few of the internal pieces. This is a very challenging puzzle.I recommend that those who have alot of time on their hands and a very big table or wooden board purchase this puzzle.It's GREAT!!"
5,lemar pro-66 1 hr battery charger,"great charger, charges batteries in one hour as advertised, also the car adapter is a real plus if you plan on charging AA batteries for your digital camera on the road as a inverter will not usually allow you to use your home charger for AA batteries. A good deal for the money. Instructions say NIMN only but worked fine on nicads"
1,DONT BUY THIS ITS CRAP,no longer at ease is the only great song on here this album sucks! DONT BUY THIS worst album ive ever bought wasnt worth 2 cents
4,Almost perfect for me...,"I thought these were great shoes but they were too wide and there is no way to adjust it. These shoes have comfy insoles and are constructed well, but the width was too much of an issue and I had to send them back. I do plan to buy more of this brand though!"
2,Not for the faint at heart,"I just wanted to warn whomever is considering purchasing this book that it has explicit pictures of ""self-massage"" as well as the Tantric Sexual Massage with pictures included. The rest of the book looks well laid out but I was very surprised and not at all happy with this purchase."
2,Huge disappointment,"I'm a fan of anything Nick Bantock and had looked forward to this one for quite a while. I even ordered it early, to get it as soon as it was released. The story starts off being readable and interesting, with quite a few sensual moments, but the ending is a huge let-down. It also does not have the usual images I've come to expect from a Bantock book. Some of them felt recycled from previous works and none of them had much to do with the story. They just sort of made the pages pretty, if you can even claim that. I'd much rather read The Venetian's Wife for the fifth time, than read this one (again)."
5,Exotic blend of ancient East-Indian music + modern keyboards,"This is a very energetic, dreamy CD replete with ancient East-Indian themes, Indian instruments (atleast 10!) and modern keyboards/percussion. I'd place it under the ambient category, but this CD really goes beyond ambient to capture the Eastern kaleidoscope of music,colors and spirituality. This is not serious ravi-shankar-type music. And it is not party music either. You just might get enlightenment with this CD..."
5,Techno meets Hindu Mysticism,The music on Tigers of the Raj is both energizing and trance-inducing. Great for high energy meditation or to spark creativity. A couple of tracks are good for more relaxed meditations as well. Overall a very excellent collection of tunes. Anyone who likes the flavor of Hindu inspired music should love it!
2,Watch out!,"Big disks = big trouble when they go bad.. this disk wasn't more than 6 months old when it died according to Seagate's testing tool (and the Data on the hard drive).. now I realize they don't do advance shipping of replacment drives - what a pain. A 5 year warranty is great and all, you just hope you don't have to use it!!Over the past 12 years, I have had more trouble with these 200+ GB drives than I have with many many other smaller drives. Always have a backup, or run RAID 1 or 5 to perserve the integrity of your data!"
5,Fast and easy,"I decided to get this drive after the one in my 2.5 year-old Dell died. Installation was a breeze, even for a computer layperson like me. It took only a few minutes to swap the drives; installing Windows took a bit longer. This new drive is fast and super quiet (my old one would always make loud noises, even when I first got it). The 5-year warranty is a big plus! Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4,the AWESOME!!!! LAKE OF TEARS!!!!,This is a really AWESOME!!! Super cool book. I would toatally reacomend it to anyone between 6 and 112!!! BYE!!!
2,What a Rip Off!,"Nathan East is an amazing bass player but I'm sorry to say this DVD is just one big commercial for his products.The interviews are really basic and hardly go into detail and the exercises he shows you are basic at best.It just doesn't live up to the professional level of video that it's cracked up to be.I honestly laughed during the interview he does with this blonde woman.She obviously knows close to nothingabout music and the questions she asks are pretty lame.The advertisement (oopse I mean interview) for his signature brand pre amp or whatever was also another comical highlight.""So basically it's like having your fingers in a box right?""don't buy this DVD"
5,"Very entrancing, gothic music; a journey in and of itself",Mysterious and captivating sounds that pull you into a world of shadows and endless dimensions. Guaranteed to soothe the soul and stimulate your mind. Get ready to go for a ride into the outer realm.
3,Not great,"This was fun to use.Take a photo and you can add glasses,a new hairsytle,a mustache or beard,a funny hat,tattoos,earrings etc.what I did'nt like is the program seems more geared toward kids than adults.I like the fact that you could make your final picture into postcard and send it to a friend."
4,A smorgasbord of Obrecht's shorter works,"A delightful introduction to Obrecht. Piffaro's usual emphasis on varying the instrumentation on their albums is in evidence here, with lute songs, viola da gamba pieces, recorder consorts, and ""band"" arrangements. Nine of the pieces are performed by the vocalists of Capilla Flamenca.A note to Piffaro fans: this album is not as ""boisterous"" as many of their works. This is not a criticism, just a warning."
5,Gift for a friend.,My friend was delighted to get this book. She didn't think she could get a copy because it's out of print. Item as described and fast shipping. Thanks!
5,Dark and shocking.,"A nice change to the sugar coated anime. Except for the surprise ending it's all what the anime should have been and mature and dark enough even by today's standards. Highly recommended for old, current and new fans. Even a good read for non fans of anime."
3,eats batteries but a pretty fun toy,"this is my first digital camera. it seems kind of generic, but it is actually pretty good, it holds a lot of pictures with 4mb of built-in space, it's easy to use, and the pics come out pretty nice. the down side to this camera is that it eats batteries like they are nothing, so make sure to buy those new Energizer Titanium or Duracell Ultra batteries, and even then they don't last more than about 50 shots without the LCD display on. Another problem i had was that i kept getting my fingers in the picture as i was holding the camera. Overall, i like this new toy, despite having to shell out the cash for the batteries, and it's a lot more cheaper than what else is out there."
3,Things to know about the Pretec DC-800 if you have WinXP,"I bought a Pretec DC - 800 ... The camera works fine. It even used to upload to my computer. I upgraded to WinXP and the camera is not compatible with WinXP when using the USB cable. You also cannot use the MGI PhotoSuite SE that comes, (or at least came when I bought mine,) with the camera with WinXP However PhotoSuite 4 is WinXP comatible. You will need to go to the Pretec WebPage... and down load the latest driver.You will need a Serial cable that will atatch to the Serial port and the Digital port on the Pretec 800. I was fortunate, my daughter had a ceap digital camera that had a Serial cable and that worked.It is a bit of a hassle, but the camera does a good job."
3,"Nice design except ""No-See-Um"" weave is too coarse","This suit has some desirable features such as the zippered neck, making access to your mouth easy. We wanted a suit that is very quick and simple to put on to avoid bee attacks in some of the areas in which we hike, and one that would prevent mosquito bites while hammocking. If you remain standing, and keep the fabric from touching your skin as much as possible, this suit would serve you well. BUT where it touches you becomes ground zero for any stinging or biting insect. These are going back. Amazon sells a tighter weaved model by Mombasa. Mosquito Net Body Suit by Mombasa Sadly, it has 3 parts, which makes putting it on in a panic far more time consuming, and the lack of a zippered neck makes access to your face more of a chore, but it is more insect proof."
3,Incorrect & Misleading Product Picture,"Don't be misled by the product picture which shows a man with both jacket and pants protection. This product is ONLY a jacket. In fact, the product I received has packaging totally different than the one shown here on Amazon- it shows a man in a jacket only. Not sure why Amazon has a product picture that is different than the actual product and is misleading as to what you're getting."
3,Arthur feels bad about cheating.,"This is a chapter book about Arthur. He sneaks up on D.W. and copies her song so that he could win a contest. He ends up not sending it in because he feels bad about copying, and D.W. wins! I like Arthur books because they are fun. This one wasn't my favorite because it wasn't as much of a mystery. I recommend this to kids who like the Arthur stories and want to read chapter books. JG"
4,nice game,This game is good but I ordered the wrong one. KOF Regulation A is the one that I am looking for. And I am also looking for KOF 2002. However I enjoyed this game because it's really good.
4,Great tracks but rough in some spots...,"It seems that Sander's mixing is consistent with his NuBreed compliation- I was thoroughly blown away by NuBreed's first disc, with its fluid mixing and impecable track selection. Disc two however left much to be desired. The same can be said about Everybody as some moments are sheer brilliance while others seem mediocre. For instance, the second disc is mixed brilliantly mixed up until My Memory, which is an outstanding record but loses some of its luster after an unimpressive mix out of Therapy. Also, 2 Bags of Grass seems tacked on and out of place on the disc. Overall this is a phenomenal CD that really highlights his talent as a DJ and producer, despite the rough patches."
3,Essentially not better,"Give me his Essential mix any day - this has great mixing but only fair on the song selection. If this is his way of progressing with his music, I'm sorely disappointed....."
3,other reviews seem a little inflated,"I bought this CD based in large part due to the numerous high reviews by other people but I was kind of dissapointed with the CD. It's not that the CD was bad.....it just wasn't that good, pretty mediocre in my opinion. Most of the songs sound pretty generic but ""My Memory"" is a really good song. Not particularly recommended."
2,Not Everybody...,"I am a huge fan of Sander's other works, but I was sorelydisappointed by this album. It pales in comparison tohis Essential Mix, as well as the Nu Breed release.This album seems to be a departure from the dreamy tranceand the tribal rhythm heard on previous offerings.It's almost as if Sander is trying to branch out toaccommodate a more American-styled fan base -- and, ironically,I say this as an American fan.Well, that said, this album is not awful. Just didn'tdo it for me. I am sure that somebody will love everytrack on this album, just not Everybody."
5,The Best,"Big Sander fan..this compilation might be the greatest mix ever released. Disc 2 is UNREAL. Check out sander's website (gallery section) to stream one of his live sets featuring the D2 dan diamond therapy track...if you're a real fan, not just some cheesy trance clubber, that track is what it's all about. The previous poster said it best- WHEW!!!"
3,CD 1 = Booooring CD 2 = Funky Fresh Dressed to Impress,"So I've listened to this mix repeatedly over the course of about three weeks now. I've tried, I really have, to see what all the hype is in the record. Everywhere you go ""10/10, A+, Classic!"" and I just can't hear it. Now I like more of a melodic, dreamy, Tiesto type of trance, so perhaps that's where my problem lies. I see the same tracks listed as everyone's favorites, which are mine as well. These include ""Midnight"" on disc 1, the opening two tracks of disc 2, and the tracks from ""Therapy"" to ""Definite Form"" on disc 2. The stuff in between, however, bores the life out of me, especially on disc 1. The good tracks on disc 2 do make it stick at as a good disc overall. I just feel that this mix is lacking one big necessity throughout that would allow it to flow better, MELODY! Therefore, the most I can give it is 3 stars. One thing's for sure, fans of Holland's other world-class DJ, Tiesto, beware because this mix is probably not for you!"
2,not as good as his previous two,"Nu breed was good, then came essential mix which was even better but the chosen tracks I felt were a somewhat boring on this compilation. Like stated above disc two is probably the best. A few good tracks here and there."
2,Europeans try to mimic Hollywood,"This is an example of what happens when European filmmakers try to mimic an American family movie. The problem is they are so steeped in the European film tradition that they don't know the difference. They make a film centered around children, but they adopt their usual slo-o-ow pace, have no plot at all, and make a film in which there is nothing of consequence at stake and in which the only things that happen are trivial. Even the ghosts are neutralized within the first few minutes, since the little girl makes friends with them and they are merely boring thereafter as they dance and sing choral songs. Also, the movie is only 80 minutes long instead of the cannonical 96 minutes.If you're a screenwriter, you might study this as an example of how NOT to make a children's movie, or a family movie, or indeed any movie.Rates two stars for the good filming of scenes of Austria.Not worth even one viewing."
4,Well Worth the Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I absolutely love this book. It is a must for any finance professional. I am a financial analyst and always find myself referring to this book as a quick reference during many projects. I don't think I can honestly work without it.
1,Misguided misconceptions,"Despite the growing need for flexible overviews of this part of the world, and, taking into account that the editor is an accomplished writer, this volume does not fill the need for even an undergraduate readership (let alone tourists!). It's poorly compiled and suffers from what must have been ""old buddies"" wanting in. A case in point is Trankell's paper. I've read it through twice and although I've spent two years of field work in the area (Trankell claims to have spent two weeks) I can't recognize any of the ""data"" she draws on to support point that escapes any sound mind. His paper is not the only bad one, but it does reflect badly on the entire composition of the volume."
4,Everything is better when it's VERY WET!,"I enjoyed this anthology of erotic stories. Of course, not every story was my cup of tea which is why I only gave it four stars.This anthology is visually exciting and sensually diverse. Contained between these pages are sexual situations from all walks of life. Therefore, if you are not sexually open-minded you might want to skip this book.What really intrigued me was the deep emotional element with in the characters of the short stories. This certainly wasn't just an anthology describing intense sexual situations but more emotional journeys incorporated in sexual situations. I was surprised by some of the endings of the stories and the wonderful writing by various authors.Another plus to this book was that it is water proof. So read it in the bath, pool, hot tub, or even in the rain! Heck, read it outloud during an adult game of slip-n-slide!girldiver:)"
4,An enchanting collection,"I'm thoroughly enjoying the stories in this collection. There's a marvelous variety of settings, styles, and voices, and the quality of the writing is excellent. Some of the pieces are quick and hot, others are longer and more reflective. The water theme has inspired an amazing array of images and emotions. From the desert to exotic islands, from the American plains to imaginary worlds, there's plenty of material here to inspire the imagination and quicken the pulse. I gave it four stars because I didn't care for the waterproof format (the book feels small and slippery, the type is too small, and I don't like the texture of the paper), but the stories are enchanting."
1,Difficult to read,"I agree with the comments here- it's just physically hard to read and I had to move to better light and lay it down on a desk to get into it. I don't know what kind of writing would make that worth reading, but this is definitely not it. I read a couple of OK stories, then I decided to return it."
2,Not very steamy,"A disappointment - not very steamy or interesting, and hard to hold and read. Most of the stories read like a writing class assignment to ""Write about water, and try to make it sexy"". The only story that was at all memorable was the one called ""Rainy Day Man."" A couple of stories were just pretentious and bad - Edrich's and Mohanraj's in particular."
1,Poor quality,"I should have known to come and read Amazon reviewers first - a poor quality book (hurts the eyes), and very ordinary and forced stories. I've learned by reading Amazon reviews to ignore al 5 star reviews, and check for the lower ratings to see what's not hype and is real."
1,Both very dull,"I got both of these Aqua Erotica books for Christmas, and while they look cute and sexy, believe me, they're not!! The stories just aren't very good, not very well-written, not funny, not much of anything. Avoid these books."
1,Difficult to read,"I wonder if anyone noticed, in their need to be clever and ""waterproof,"" that this book is _too heavy_ to hold comfortably and read, and that the jammed-in print is small enough to hurt the eyes?"
1,a gimmick,A poor gimmick for something striving so hard to be literary. It always helps if you can read the words easily. Even if they're not worth the effort.
1,"Dull, unsexy","Really not very good stories - not particularly sexy, nor good romance, nor good lit. Avoid this one, there's so many better erotic books."
1,A dud,A dud - drowning in amateur writing and dull stories. Back to Susie Bright's & Marcy Sheiner's books for me.
4,drop it into the tub,Overall a fine book by some authors that I've never heard of before. 1 standout was Diane Kepler's story which is worth the purchase price of the book alone. Drop the book in the tub - it works!
5,WOW,What an amazing book. Its very descriptive for your imagination. Its the book you can pick up and read in the tub when you want to just relax and forget about you day.
3,A little something for everyone..,"I had this book years ago and seemed to have lost it. I just repurchased it and it was just as hot as reading it the first time. There are a variety of stories. Some are boring and uneventful but ""Hot Springs"" is my favorite and worth the purchase."
1,Rather dull writing,"Quite a disappointment - very dull, perhaps even.... soggy! Not worth the time. I think this needed a better editor with the literary/erotica taste of Bright or Sheiner, and then it might have come together. And it could do without the weird waterproof pages."
2,Sinks like a ton of bricks in every way!,"This book sinks, both literally in water, and literarily in words. Bathtub reading should be light, sexy, fun, and this thing is overwritten, forced, and plodding. Isn't there a law about how many serious mermaid stories anyone can put in a book?"
4,Lots of fun in the water!,"... There are a lot of hetro themes in this book, along with all other ranges. My husband and I found this very enjoyable on our anniversary trip with a jacuzzi tub in our room. The print is a bit small, which is why I rated it 4 stars, but the stories are quite erotic and enjoyable."
3,"Not Arousing, But Interesting","I got this book after reading Mohanraj's other collection, ""Torn Shapes of Desire"", which I liked a lot. While this collection doesn't quite measure up to the other, it is still quite an interesting read. Although no story here aroused me in the least, I still found them very interesting to read, particularly the stories that treaded on into rather dangerous territory, such as ""In Deep"", which touches on the themes of sex and death and total surrender. ""Seven Cups Of Water"" (Mohanraj's own contribution) I also enjoyed immensely, as it touched on members in a society which would not tolerate the sort of relationship that they needed to make them whole (although I think Deepa Mehta's file ""Fire"" was a better story in this respect). there are numerous stories of homosexual encounters here, so if you find that offensive, it may be best to pass on this one. But I will say this for the book . . . unlike most ""erotica"", it actually makes you think!"
4,Aquatic fun!,"It is important to remember that the book was printed on plastic pages so you could get it WET. Hence the revealing title, ""Aqua Erotica."" ""Aqua"" is Latin for ""water."" I highly recommend ... for any readers interested in etymology, or who just want to understand what they're reading.Now, about the book: filled with a variety of soft-core erotica, it could function as a sort of primer for those unfamiliar with the genre. In fact, that is why I purchased the book. The wonderful range in tone ensures that every reader will find at least one story that appeals to him or her. And that means you can add a new name (or names) to your list of ""Authors to Discover,"" always a noble pursuit.I had a great time reading Aqua Erotica. It was a shallow paddle through variations on ""normal"" sexuality, and a scuba dive into the possiblities afforded to us by deviating from that norm."
1,Gimmicky & dull,"Stories you can't remember 10 minutes after you read them, which might by ok if they were sexy, but they're not. A disappointment, and highly overrated."
5,Great for American Girl fan,Got this to go with my daughter's American girls for her 9th birthday. She has devoured the books and this is for the doll while I'm also incorporating the AG Birthday book for some activities. The pieces are well made like other AG items.
5,Wow,"Before I read this book, I was afraid to lead and would back off leads if I thought there was a chance I might fall. I had led a couple 5.9s, and easier routes, on bolts. Last week, I led a sustained 5.10d, last month I took my first lead fall on a 5.10c, and yesterday I led 5.10b as if it were 'no big deal.' The Rock Warrior's Way has transformed my view of leading and of climbing in general, and has opened up a whole new world of climbing for me. Thank you, Arno!!!"
5,All climbers must read,"Just like the title says- if you climb, you should read this. Wish I'd read it before getting all of my bad habits. Easy read, great exercises to perform when climbing."
5,This book Changes you,"Great book, I learned a lot about myself and about my climbing. I feel myself improve every time I pick up this book both as a climber and a being on this planet."
2,Achilles' heel,">>>>>>>---------Carlos Castaneda---------->""An important component of the warrior literature for me is the work ofCarlos Castaneda"" pg xxviihis work is suspect and considered fiction, so you built a whole mental schemabased on fiction..that's funny the 1000 headed dragon has swallowed u wholewould you rely on a pro that's suspect, when 50 ft above it.I have a suggection for your next book Arno ""The Rock Sorcerer's Way""and base it on Harry Potter.."
2,"Great Ideas, but where's the Beef?","My wife ordered this book and thinks it is a great compilation of all the other ""good stuff"" you might want to make as an appetizer or just add as a side dish to spice up your meal (so, that's where they got the title from!). Overall, we enjoyed reading this book and looking at all the different recipes they offered. One of the first recipes in the book is for a country pate (which they extoll as being the greatest thing since sliced bread), and if you're into pate, it actually sounds quite tasty. Our BIGGEST concern with this recipe is that they sort of forget to tell you how much chicken liver you need to use for this recipe (although they are very specific about all the other ingredients). Sort of makes us worry about what's missing in the rest of the book. Other than that, it's a pretty neat reference. p.s. If anyone gets this book and figures out what the amount is, please let us know. : )"
1,An old english translation,"This translation is in anacronistic old English, published in gothic script which is difficult to read. It has many ommissions from Serlio's original text, and quite a few ideosyncratic additions. It has no commentary, index or introduction. Whilst it is of importance for historians of the early modern period in England, students of Serlio who want to read him translated accurately should buy the recently published (1996) excellent English translation published by Yale University Press."
3,Sample questions are overly convoluted,"This is the first book that I used to study for the GMAT. While I found it to be a good introduction to the test, and the software to be easy to use, I found the test questions to be overly convoluted. The book tried too hard to create questions where you would miss a tiny subtlety and thus choose the wrong answer. I also found sample questions that were answered incorrectly.I preferred the Princeton Review's Cracking the GMAT (for test taking tips) and the Official GMAT Review (for experience with real questions)."
3,Practice test questions are too lengthy,"This book has good content. Covers the various sections in simple and crisp manner. The practice tests software is also very good. The only complaint I have with this book is the practice questions are too lengthy. It could cause you to panic that you may not be able to complete the test in time. It typically takes about 25 to 30 seconds to read 100 words. The average length of a question in the practice test is about 200 words. It means you take about 1 min to read the question itself, which means you will not be left with enough time to think, review specific parts of the question and arrive at your conclusion. This could lead you to believe you are too slow. Instead the length of the questions is not a true representation of the one you see in the exam.Good luck!"
1,Not the Camera I thought it would be,"Takes to many Blurry Pictures. I've use this camera in different venues (ie. Sporting events,indoor party and wedding. I would say over 60% of the pics came out blurry. I read the manual a couple times thinking it was me and still produced many blurry pics. The final straw was a retirement party for a co-worker who wanted the pics for a keep sake and most of them were blurry as well. I sent the Camera back and got a Canon S50. I haven't taken 1 bad picture since. You get what you pay for and for a little bit more I got a much better camera with the Canon."
1,camera,needed the cord to plug in to do any thing with it. Will have to get another cord to try to get it wright.
1,Poor customer Service,The camera worked excellent for a short period of time. I didn't use the camera very often so when it stopped working just after the warranty ran out. I tryed to contact Kodaks tech dept via the web and could never get in. I finaly called thier help line and after being on hold for 45 minutes some one finaly picked up the line I was on. The determined that I would have to send it in for repair and the estimated cost was $125 dollars. If have any concerns over customer service for you product or reliabillity do not purchase from Kodak.
2,Be Careful,"Purchased this camera a short time ago. It was the second Kodak DX camera I purchased. Many problems with software, many problems with charging both cameras on the charging dock and the flash on both DX's stopped working. One while in warrenty and the second just out of warrenty. They want $95.00 plus shipping to repair the flash. I don't take a lot of pictures- maybe 50 a year that require flash so I warn others about Kodak cameras especially if you take many pics that require flash."
4,Easy to Use!,"This is my first digital camera, so I've got nothing to compare to. The software installation was easy, and I was taking pictures immediately. I've got the transfer dock, and that part is awesome too. I just put the camera on, push a button, and my pics are immediately transferred onto the computer and in the Kodak software for easy emailing, organizing or print ordering. The pictures are crisp and clear; however....they are a bit dark. I took some pictures during the daytime in a room that has dark walls, and even using the flash, the hue of everything was kind of abnormally dark orange/red. And, if it's dark, the flash makes objects in the pics really really bright white, almost like overflash."
5,lovin' it!,"I have been taking portraits and head shots for a while now with an SLR and just recieved this camera as a gift and am loving every minute of use! If you read all of the directions there is no reason that it should be hard to use, etc. The pics are high quality and the video option is great to have without having to drag along a camcorder. Very very easy to use and the results are terrific! I would definitely suggest this to anyone!"
4,4+++ out of 5,"Just bought this camera a few days ago. It could not be easier to operate. All functions are logical and clear. The menu items are made as easy as possible. The only gripe so far are the lens cap is a bit of a pain. It's supposed to pop off when the camera is turned on, sometimes it doesn't. The other is the camera needs to have some type of grippable surface added to the body. I can't get a firm, comfortable grip and feel like the camera could slip from my hands.Pictures are great."
4,Works For Me,"I like this camera. Had a previous one and used this to replace it after I dropped the old one on a tile floor and broke the lens. It's very basic, but works quite well for simple picture taking."
4,kodak dx4530,"I've had this camera for almost two years and am now in the market for a new one. It served it's purpose well and I can not complain about the camera. Although starting about 6 months or so ago, the quality of the pictures started to diminish. Now everyone time I upload pictures I have to lighten every single picture - which is quite time consuming. The pictures turn out very dark. So if you're looking down the road on how the camera will perform after lots of use, this is just what I experienced."
2,Mixed opinion,"I gave this camera all the time and kept giving the befit of doubt to it, that may be I am not taking the pics properly and the fact that it is a kodak, and who would make a better camera than kodak.I still have it and looks like that I am going to return it, the pics are excellent on sunny days and also indoor pics are very good too especially if the subject is close. But the evening pics are just disgusting, and dont even talk about the night pics, flash is useless if the subject is more than 15 feet away.My biggest problem is that this camera gives very very blurry pics if it is shaken even very slightly duing the pic. Sometimes it is blurry, and sometimes it is not.Easy of usability: Great.Internal memory: Great (32MB).Pixels 5MB: Great.Price: Great.But it cannot take great pics, why bother with all the other things."
1,love the camera,I found the camera so easy to use. I would not have been familar with digital cameras until we purchased this kodak camera. everything with it is so simple. so easy to use. Brilliant camera.
4,"IF COMPUTER WON'T RECOGNIZE THE CAMERA OR DRIVERS, TRY THIS!","... a good and inexepensive solution -- don't start pulling your hair out!! Get an SD/MMC card that fits right in the slot in the side of the camera, and a twenty-dollar USB SD/MMC card reader - you're good to go!!! Check the owner's manual for instructions on transferring photos from the camera's internal memory to the memory card, then put the card in the card reader and voila! ADDED BONUS: you will now be able to take more photos at a time - you can fill up both the internal memory and the card's memory. This is a great little camera by the way, and I would still buy it again."
2,Poor instructions & Dock doesn't work,This camera is very confusing. Instructions are to little to understand. Does not tell anything about the Dock which didn't work. The batteries are $20 a piece.No support. The pictures would not download to computer. Kept saying other program was open. POOR SYSTEM.Steve
4,I'm happy with it . . .,"Got mine right after Thanksgiving and haven't had a lot of time to experiment with it.I took it to a concert, and the photos in the low light didn't turn out very well, but I'm not sure that I've mastered how to use it in low light. ""Regular"" photos turn out great. I don't care for the software, but I think it's because I'm used to the one that came with my WINDOWS package.I got the docking station and love the convenience of uploading without a cable. Way kewl on that."
1,camera is crap in low light,"won't focus unless you are in bright sunlight, jpeg compression is bad, can see the artifacts in an 8x10 that used highest quality mode. Took it back the next day."
3,Close ups are questionable.,Fair camera for the price. I have found out that a close up of something that has text is blurry. I have a college with a similiar Cannon product. When I compare the pictures side to side the Cannon wins out. I have had a brand new out of the box Kodak 4 MP camera that I gave to a relative. After 15-17 pictures it kept saying the battery was dead. With every NEW battery replacement it kept saying the same thing. My faith in Kodak products is going down hill
1,NOT FOR EBAY SELLERS,"I purchased this camera after my Olympus 1.2 Megapixel died after 5 years of hard use. If I could revive my Olympus, I would in a heartbeat. I am so very Disgusted with this Kodak camera. It is impossible to get a picture that doesn't look dark indoors. I sell items on ebay and the pictures I attempted to take of anything red came out very blurry. I read the entire manual and tried every combination of settings to try to improve the picture quality. The night vision also produces extremely blurry images. It is easy to use, and the software is easy, I liked the camera dock, but if you want good quality pictures, don't go with this camera. I am taking it back and spending the extra money on the Olympus, my first one never failed me."
2,OK pictures terrible software,"Camera is small, light and easy to handle. It takes ok pictures, nothing great but acceptable. The kodak software is awful. Half the time it works and half the time I have to delete the program and reinstall. Maybe I am spoiled by my Sony camcorder that also takes still pictures where the camera and software work very well. Have had the kodak since Oct 2003 and find it only marginally satisfactory."
5,exellent straight up trad rockabilly,"Traditional 50's style rockabilly, very twangy, and swingy. Great slap bass player, who has that ""sound,"" hot uptempo swingers, are mixed with several medium tempo tunes, but the overall sound is upbeat and hot."
2,Great Game. Mattel GOT CHEAP,"This game is a great educational game. Also alot of fun. Given the price what should have i expected regarding quality. The material is cheap plastic, cheap felt, and NO rollover cover to hold the pieces in their slots. It's also hard to place a piece down on the board or into the side slot. It's like they asked some chinese company to design the SMALLEST amount of plastic in use to make this game as cheaply as possible. I don't expect this to last for years to come! Either way if you want Othello, I highly recommend you search for the more durable but also more expensive version."
4,Complicated Simplicity!,"Lately we have been on a very competitive 2 player strategy game kick... and I purchased this game as an alternative to Scrabble and Boggle (my favorite 2 player word games, which I usually win!). I found Othello easy to learn, but man is it hard to master! I still haven't won yet, though not for want of trying!The difficutly of each game will depend on the strategic skill of your opponent, and there definitely are some good (and bad) strategies to use. Even so, this would be a game two children (or an adult and a child) could enjoy playing due to its simplistic rules. For me, it's been a good lesson on how to lose gracefully. :)"
4,more fun than checkers,EASY to learn to play. Strategically challenging. Can play several games in a reasonable amount of time. Simple classic that I enjoyed playing as a kid and now I enjoy playing with my kids.
5,A Classic Game that my kids love,I wondered if my kids would enjoy this as much as I did when I was little. They sure do. They got it on Christmas day and we had to make them stop to go to bed. It's been a long time since something that did not require batteries held their attention like this.
4,Good two player game,"This is a good two player game that has very simple rules, but is still challenging. You can play with kids or adults & there is no set-up time."
3,A fun game but wish it was how I remembered,"This is a fun game. I was a little disappointed however, because when I was a kid, the pieces were heavier and there weren't grooves on the board so the pieces could move easier. I thought by buying the ""collectible"" version, it would be how I remembered, but apparently the game had been changed awhile ago."
4,Othello Review,"This is a fun game for two people to play. I bought this for a friend in the hospital.When a guest comes to visit, she is able to play this to pass the time. She really likes it.I would purchase this again."
2,Leonard Bernstein,"The music sounded beautiful, the songs were not ones that I really knew and so I was not impressed with the entire album. Songs and Prayers that I knew, I enjoyed"
2,fantastic,"The book "" The Holocaust and Nazi Germany"" is about what Hitler and the nazi army did to the Jews. It tells you about what happened to the Jews. It discusses how the Jews were treated when the were in the consecration camps and how the were so scared of Hitler and the Nazi army. This was connected to WWII because it was about the holocaust and the Nazi Germany, which accrued during WWII"
3,Excellent leading cast,"Although one could not exactly call this film memorable, it is certainly worth watching if you are a fan of either Spencer Tracy or James Stewart. The two mammoth Hollywood ledgends make this film entertaining despite the script's forgettable status."
5,If you are a fan of vintage Carla get this now!,"If you love albums like Social Studies, Musique Mechanique or Escalator over the Hill this might be to your liking. Excellent yet kind'a low key compositions with Swallow and strings as partners for this interesting project. Carla Bley shows once again she has a knack for unusual and a very personal style kind of 'canterbury jazz' (for lack of a better term)."
1,Far from true,"This book tries to make Elvis look like a dumb southern boy,which is far from the truth. I wasted money on this one as I am a true Elvis fan."
5,Spectacular !,"At first glance, the exchange of letters between 20-year-old Elvis Presley and Achsa McEachern (a lonely 14-year old girl growing up in Georgia) might seem like shaky foundation for a novel. But Diane Thomas makes it work. Ascha has the complexity and pathos of a character from the pages of a Pat Conroy novel. And Elvis is revealed with all his flaws, promise, and glory.One of the marks of a good book is that it stays with you long after you've read the last page. I read ""The Year the Music Changed"" in 2005. Seven years later, it's still fresh in my mind and Achsa McEachern is as real to me as Elvis."
4,"read it in one sitting, lighthearted read.","shows you the real truth about the 1950's not just the happy go-lucky ""perfect american family"" nostalgia memory that we have of it. it truly was a repressive time. the novel deals with a 14 year old named Achsa, the novel is a series of fan letters that she writes to elvis presley and the corresspondence between them. Ascha's life is spinning out of control, with more and more going on, while she's having big city dreams and desires for a better life somewhere out there as a performer. the standard of the day is conformity and she is being destroyed by it. very well written piece of work."
4,Culinaria European Specialties,"Pro's :This book is excellent in historical, pictorial, and reseach. Very interesting written. Very helpful for shopping,what items are indigoues to each country. Great tool for teaching purpose.Contra:Some of the recipes are not working to well accuracy, refinement, would need some revision.Sincerely M.B. Instructor"
5,Masterful!,Finally a cookbook that presents the true nature of pure German cooking without diluting it by pandering to foreign tastes. Culinaria Germany is so superior that you might as well burn all your other German cookbooks.
4,bargin for the price,I bought this book for my son as he is playing learning to play both the electric and acoustic guitar. He seems to like this book okay but doesn't use it as much as I thought he would. Good deal for the price...
3,Misses quite a bit.,"You get as much music for each song as they could stuff onto 2 pages per song! Think about that! So a song like ""To live is to die"", you know they can't fit all onto two pages.But i'd have been satisfied learning the main parts but there is a nasty habit of completely skipping intro riffs! The ""Four Horseman"" intro is not in this book! That is THE signature riff to that song and it's not there. Along with a lot of other holes. Sorry."
5,Cool and Comfy,These sleeveless t-shirts are very good quality. I have washed them several times and there was no shrinkage and they hold their shape well. These can go from the washer to the dryer and retain their good looks with no problem. The sizes do run a little large. My husband wears X-large and I had to order the L for him.
1,run in the material,The shirt was very imperfect. did not bother to send it back but should have. not a good buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Poor fit and finish,"This is not a ""sleeveless"" T-shirt. The website image clearly shows a finished garment with a sewn hem around the arm hole. Rather, this is simply an unfinished garment from a cut-and-sew operation. Arm holes have a sloppy fit with no hem and loose threads."
1,worst movie,It was one of the worst movie I ever see on prime instant movies. I wouldnt recommended it to my worst enimes.
3,no english subtitles,"This foreign language movie doesn't have the needed English subtitles. Too bad, it looks like a good movie. It would be nice if most Amazon Prime movies had captions available like Netflix provides. I really didn't want to rate this movie because I haven't seen it but to post a review it is necessary."
5,A Pencil Master Class,"This book has an energy which Ink Drawing did not quite achieve. The technical considerations of the artist are intuitively interwoven with his subject matter. I do not know of a similar book which reveals, not only the authors mastery of the subject but his amazing use of space on paper. There is also a very human side projected in his usually meticulous descriptions of material and method when drawing with Brendan Behan. A wonderful book, not influenced by its age, a master class."
3,"Mildly interesting music, well played","Joseph Achron (1886-1943) was, apparently, an excellent violinist, and it shows in his rhapsodic and intense first violin concerto. Intermingled with the fervently intense episodes are moments of romantic lyricism, and the whole thing is musically maybe closest to Ernst Bloch - with more than a dash of Scriabin. Oliveira dispatches all hurdles thrown at him, and he is nicely accompanied by the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin under Joseph Silverstein.The suite from The Golem is an atmospheric five-movement work with several original touches and the Belshazzar tableaux are inventive and colorful, somewhat Hollywoodish pieces.Despite the interesting touches, I am not sure Achron's music really adds up to very much; the final impression is, in fact, rather anodyne. The music is splendidly played, of course, and the sound is fine. I'd give it a qualified recommendation."
1,Odd price,"I saw the movie, which left me slightly dissatisfied. The book sounds better, but why is the Kindle price twice as much as a new paper back copy? One star for the price rip-off."
3,Then She Found Me - 3.5,"A book where I am actually hoping the movie is a little more entertaining. Ms. Lipman writes extremely well - refreshing. However, I felt the main character a little dull. I know this book is fiction but as someone who is adopted I don't think I would be so ""dull"" if someone showed up at my door saying ""hi, I'm your mother"".The scenes were well written, you were there at the dinner table, at the restaurant. I was researching in the library, but at times I was bored.Look forward to the movie."
3,Cute and funny but a weak ending,"Lipman has a gift for writing funny dialogue and creating intriguing characters but after a great build-up, I found the second half of this book to be disappointing. It almost seemed as if the author was tired of the story and wanted to finish it quickly. All in all though, it's a very quick read and good if one is interested in light summer reading."
4,I enjoyed this book very much,"A very well written book. The characters were so well drawn. I especially liked the romance. It is rare to read of a romance in a novel today between two people who are not ""beautiful people"", that is, not rich, or gorgeous, or especially successful, but just people like most of us!"
4,"Really good book, but definitely not perfect","I wish I had had this book available when I began learning UNIX system administration. The book is full of useful examples and really good advice. His coverage of native UNIX backup tools is extremely good. The discussions of bare metal recovery are by themselves worth the cost of the book.It's not a perfect book, however. I found the book to be too chatty, with too many personal anecdotes that just distract from the message. More importantly, the author fails to go into any depth comparing the commercial backup packages that are available for UNIX systems and relational databases. He explains ways to evaluate the various packages, which is valuable, but some actual commentary and opinion would have been most welcome."
2,disappointing,"This is the first of the O'Reilly books I have been disappointed in. I bought the book for one reason-- to find out how to restore a / and /usr file system off a remote tape drive. Unfortunately the book does not answer this question, all of its examples assume the server has a local tape drive attached. The authors spend their time touting freebie utilities at the expense of a thourough discussion of the backup and restore capabilities that come with the operating system."
5,"This is ""The"" Bible of Backup and Recovery","I wish I had this book available many years ago. I read the chapters almost everyday since I baught it (this one is one of the best books i baught). If you are dealing with Backup and recovery on Unix, High availability etc. This is the book you want. The book has lots of humourus stories about his encounters with backup and restore senarios. I liked the Preface page. The book is all filled with the ""right"" information you need.Great book ! Great value for money !"
4,URGENT!!!! MUST READ THIS FIRST!!!!,"First let me say that this is not a ""review"" of how good or bad this game is,no no no this is a WARNING to anybody out there looking to buy this game for your PlayStation 2.It's important that you know that this game is NOT for an american PS2(ntsc-u/c)!!! This is Japan ONLY!!!(ntsc-J)I think it's pretty cappy that whoever is selling this did not state that in the description. It WILL NOT play in your American PS2 in fact it was NEVER released for the PS2 in America,Only Japan and Europe,however it DID release in North America on the XBOX so you might wanna check that out. having said that,This is one of the best games I've ever played in my life!!!"
1,Going Postal. JUNK,"This thing is a POS. I have had nothing but trouble with it since day one. I am on day 3.Their website looks like a 4 year old made it. Their support section and FAQ were made by 2 year olds.Just when I thought I knew how it operated, it wouldn't work.You get what you pay for. I wouldn't sell this thing to my worst enemy for a 100000000000000000% profit."
3,Worth its Price,"This thing is the cheapest MP3 with a 1.5G capacity that I could find on the internet. Well for $70 you can not expecct more... Although it freezes some times and you have to reset, although the playlist really sucks, although the jogdial sucks as well, although it's heavy, ugly and huge, still it's worthy for that $70, after all, if you can not bear it any more, break it down and get the 1.5G harddrive will still be a good idea."
2,Crappy MP3 Player,Buy this mp3 player ONLY IF:1. You have filled out the Id3 tags on all your mp3's2. You listen to your mp3's while sitting down and not movingMoving around and any sort of contact with this mp3 player causes it to freeze (won't turn off unless you reset it with a paper clip). There are much better choices out there! Especially flash-based mp3 players.
1,Broke down within 2 months,It often gets stuck and i have to use a pin to reset this thing.Now I can not turn it on even though I charged it full.The rebate system that this company employs never works. I bought two of this but never got the $30 rebate for any of them eventhough I mailed everything.
5,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"I bought this MP3 player about 2 weeks ago. (...) I use it at the gym and it does not skip, which I was concerned about. I have 15 cd's on it now and it is about half full. I haven't found a down side yet."
3,May be good for getting your feet wet,"Click this button. Type this. Click that button. Type that.Yes, you can build a website. The author takes you step-by-step and click-by-click through the entire process of building a website - and that's what the author promises.The only problem is that you have little or no idea of WHY you're doing what you're doing, or exactly how these buttons and clicks and symbols and timelines fit together within the program. I suppose an explanation of what you're accomplishing would have taken a lot more work on the author's part.There are a fair number of errors in the book, such as mislabled buttons and incorrect page numbers, but it's not bad enough to really screw you up. You have to wonder why a company would publish a book with these kind of errors...This may be a good book for getting your feet wet, but don't expect to go out and do your own site after you finish this book."
3,"OK Book, filled with errors...","Quite a few errors - the worst being page 30, ""extra bits"" which is referenced on page 21, is completely missing. A book this small and concise should never have been released with such pathetic mistakes."
2,Good... if you just want to follow instructions,"I was looking to design my first Flash-based website. This book may have helped me do it... but I learned nothing in the process. It did not answer any of my ""whys"" or ""hows"" - just merely gave me step by step instruction. Furthermore, several of the steps, when followed exactly (trust me...sometimes I'd redo them 3 and 4 times to make sure) would not produce the results the book said they would. If you're looking for a more comprehensive, teach-a-man-to-fish type of book, this is not what you're looking for."
3,Not quite worth the wait...,"There was a song or two by this band with the same line-up (Tompa on vocals)contained on the SWEDISH ASSAULT compilation of a few years back. Good n'heavy. Real loud bass and low end with driving beat. Very 'Motorhead' with pissed letchered screams of nihilism. Finally the full length album comes out. I paid about 50 cents under $20 for this CD. Well, it's interesting until you get to the 4th song. Hey... each song sounds the same (same three chords played with the same drumbeat.) I would have been happy if this CD was $11 after tax, or if it was an EP of half the price with half of the songs here. Am I paying so much for this CD because Tomas Lindburg is a top payed 'studio vocalist' these days? He should stick to just one or two bands because he's giving himself a bit of over-exposure. Buy this CD if you can find it for $10 or under. Its not worth more than that."
4,nevermind the headbanger hype!!!,"If you are expecting At The Gates, you're not gonna get it on this one! If you are into bands like Discharge, Motorhead, or anything crusty from Sweden or England then pick this one up...it will not disappoint! A total barrage of rock and roll fused crusty hardcore...fueled by Tompa's vicious screams!"
1,Typical Cash-In,"This album is the perfect example of how record labels will try to capitalize on a respected artist by plastering their name to the front of the CD case. That's how I was suckered into buying this one. The sticker said ""Featuring Thomas Lindburg (from At The Gates)"" Now, we all know the former singer from At The Gates is a brillian lycicist and extremely p*ssed-off sounding screamer. And usually his voice is paired with some searing top-notch metal. But this time, the music is Swedish Punk (for lack of a better description). The music is downright boring. This album can't even compare to the last effort from Nightrage, which Thomas also sang on. Sure, he is free to let out his aggression in other forms of music, but Century Media should let us know what we are buying, instead of deceiving us into buying this crap."
2,"Let's tell the truth, shall we?","I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this book because of the author's political views. She clearly knows a lot about the subject and offers quite a bit of insight into the mermaids' powers, but completely ignores the fact that mermaids have been using their ability to control the weather to wreak havoc on humankind. For centuries, mermaids have unleashed floods and hurricanes on the unsuspecting human population in an ill-advised attempt to wipe us all out. Everyone knows that mermaids caused Katrina?!?!If I wanted to read yet another screed by a mermaid apologist, I would have picked up a copy of A Survival Guide for Landlocked Mermaids, by Margot Datz. How sad that so many otherwise excellent authors have been seduced into parroting the mermaids' agenda.Fellow humans beware--this author is nothing more than an empty-headed puppet for the mer-elite!"
2,A mermaid reference book for the easily pleased.,Love research on folklore. And compilations of myth or legend.But this struck me as the 'ultra-lite' version. This book is not outstanding or special in any way. Suggest readers (whether child or adult) get this from the library before they decide to spend any money for their own copy. Glad I did. There are plenty of other mermaid books that contain stunning art and text.
2,Misleading Title...,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a long book about old legends and facts about mermaids, however, i found that only a few chapters were about what the title referred to. most of the chapters where about religion and summoning mermaids and casting spells. it mentioned alters, using candles, herbs, stones, and salts. a great book if your looking for ocean connected beliefs, a less then decent book of mermaids"
5,Mermaids,Always loved mermaids as a kid. This is going to be something I'll definitely get some use out of. DJ Conway is an exceptional writer.
4,Magickal Mermaids And Water Creatures: Invoke The Magick Of The Waters,Love the author's presentation. It make you feel like you are one with the mermaids. I don't like to read much. But this book got me reading page by page.I wish it has color illustration on the mermaids.The books discuss all aspect of mermaids and all kinds of merfolk and water creature.
4,"Quarter Circle forward, light punch","Two games for the price of one, if you like the King of Fighters series then who could complain?"
2,I'll stick with wool for now.,"I wear Wigwam Athletic Wool Husky Socks regularly . . . perfect fit, comfortable, they breathe and last out pretty well. Thought I'd take a chance on some Wigwam cotton and or synthetic socks for an option. These Volley socks, for me, are too elastic and binding on my leg (they compress and stay up well, I'm sure) but, at the end of the day, when I take my socks off, I don't want to see a circumferential ring of restricted circulation on my leg. So I'll stick with the Wigwam Wool Husky Athletic crew socks which are the best fitting socks that I have found."
4,Bleak Indeed,"The first & only album by Bleak (aptly-named group, I say) takes much of the same qualities that made Lycia so captivating and wrappeds them with a darker, heavier edge. The songs have a sort of mystic feeling about them, while still maintaining a sense of dread that flows throughout the record. The chaotic mood that 'Vane' possesses, is what makes this great. Though it's relatively hard to find now, if you can get your hands on a copy, it's probably second-hand already so don't worry about stealing it!"
3,SOMETHING DIFFERENT!,"This is a great CD if you like being lulled into a trance. It's mainly twisted ambient music. The voice is VERY unique. The guy seriously sounds like he's Satan himself. It's great for entertainment value, but not so great for hours of listening enjoyment. If you really like wierd stuff though, this CD is definitely for you!"
5,Comment on the translation,"I own a number of translations of Homer, and the Rieu/Jones translations of The Odyssey and The Iliad are among my favourite (the others are Albert Cook's and Mandelbaum's translation of The Odyssey). I like all these better than the Fagles since they are more faithful to the original text.If you order this book, grab yourself a Cliff Notes just so you get the necessary background info so it all makes sense.Good luck!"
5,quality product!,This was a gift for my father.He was very pleased with the quality of this brush.It's always questionable when purchasing site unseen.We were both pleasantly suprised!
3,On the hard side,"This seems to be a well made brush. My only complaint is that it is very stiff and can be very hard on the scalp. The last boar bristle brush I bought was too soft, so I am still searching for the perfect brush."
2,Hairbrush with very few bristles.,The brush has short bristles set to far apart on the brush.It doesn't do a very good job. I wish I would have spent a little more and gotten a higher quality brush.
2,just another stiff hair brush,i tried it and found it to be much too coarse for my thinning hair and scalp & i'm in the process of returning it
2,Bristles are too hard.,"The bristles on this brush were too hard and painful to use. Description states it's made of boar hair, but it felt more like nylon or some sort of polymer. Using this brush felt like using a standard nylon brush, but without the rounded plastic tip on the ends."
3,Good but I was expecting more!,"Just a quick note to say that if were around a level 10 or 12 under the old ranking system before the update and looking to gain an edge, don't bother with this book. You won't learn anything new.It is a very good guide to Halo 2 multiplayer if you're lacking in Rumble Pits and Team Games, but I wouldn't really bother with it otherwise.A lot of effort has been put into the book and it shows.If you're looking for Head to Head tips, there is absolutely nothing in this book.The book serves as an excellent introduction to complete beginners.I feel that the book falls short in its description and should not have been called ""Advanced Combat Techniques"" but rather ""Beginner/Intermediate Combat techniques"""
2,fairly decent,"I dont care what people say this book is for begginners. It does provide some really great tips but, im a lvl 26 (spuddy nutt and backdraft757 if you want to check) i found that i new most stuff. there were however several things that did improve my game and i did use a couple of the tips just for test. If you are just beggining then this will help alot but otherwise you need to learn how to improve on these strategies so that they are more flexible and you can adapt to suprises better but all in all it was a good book well written and nicely pieced together."
3,"Cawood may be a good player now,","But by the time he wrote the book he was clearly a ""n00b"" - my guess is level 10 at most, which is average rank. Although book contains few advices from real pros (MrJukes, Crew 116), most of the book is fluff. Probably if you are level 12 or above and have been visiting various halo sites, there is nothing you can learn from the book. If you are really struggling at 8 or 9 then it might help you."
1,"Aside from Jukes, the authors are no elite players.",Char is one of the dumbest players I have ever played against. He charges for powerups and weapons without looking around and does so in a repetitive fashion. I would recommend going to www.jukesbox.com and watching his jump vids and the vids of him playing.
1,where is the fun in following instructions,"If you are an ELITE Gamer, using guides is a big ""NO NO"". where's the fun in that. Someone telling you which weapon to use and how to approach a fight scene. Can't you think for yourself and figure things out ? Stratergy guides and guides like this bring down the gaming level of the community as a whole.After reading things like this, you'll be a narrow minded noob.Every time you'll apply the same old trick you were told and while it will work against other narrow minded noob, every now and then you'll face an opponent ONLINE who thinks on his feet.some open-minded person who comes up with new ways of defeating the enemy even when he is outnumbered and outGUNNED. This guid won't really help then, will it ?"
4,Good Size For A Small Dog,"I have a 12 pound Shih Tzu who gets more on his face than in his stomach. These wipes are perfect for cleaning his face and also for wiping his paws when he comes into the house after a long walk. I don't use them every day, so they aren't that expensive - although if I did have to use them more than once a day, they would be costly. I don't use them after a bathroom walk, preferring a damp paper towel instead.I've been using them for years and the container of 70 lasts for a long time, although if they sit for too long, the cloths do dry up."
2,just don't grab the junk,"I've used wipes from different brands to clean my dog's face and feet after raw feeding with fair success. these wipes just seem to leave much of the oils and don't seem to grab the extra gook off very well. though more expensive, Natures Miracle Deodorizing Coat Wipes are much better at cleaning and at least 3 times the size."
3,"Good for the price, but better products are out there","These wipes have a great scent and are made by a company I like. However, at our training school, they use the Earthbath brand, and I have found those to be superior in terms of thickness and moisture. I will buy those next time; they are worth the extra money."
3,Good but ......,"Pros...Good wipe, good scent, good price per wipe, dog likes. Cons...dispenser and roll of wipes do not work well to separate the wipes for use. Clumsy to operate the dispensing of wipe. I prefer wipes that come quick and easy. However. the main product is good."
1,For a Lab and Golden,"So, these are for my lab and golden retriever. They are thin and don't work worth a crap. The golden had gotten spayed, thought it would help because can't bath her right now. It didn't-go get baby wipes, they work better."
2,These pet wipes are made in China,The order arrived promptly and seemed to work the same as baby wipes or something similar but what I don't like about them is that they are made in China and that appears nowhere on the product details when ordering. There have been too many incidents with pet products from China in the last few years and I am just not comfortable using these on my pets
5,"Quick, Easy, Clean-up and De-stinking!","The same stuff you love in a spray form, only in wet wipes! Great for traveling or quick clean ups when your dog gets in to things he shouldn't. Makes it easier to go a little longer between baths. Good value, too!"
3,They're ok. Not sure if I would recommend them.,"I guess, in the end, these work ok. But I'm not a big fan. The fabric makes them slippery. They don't seem to catch the dirt. So they don't feel like they do much. They do make my dog smell less dirty, but it's not the same as giving him a bath. Today I used them while the mud on my dog was dried. They did get the mud off, so to that effect, I would recommend them. I'm still looking for a better alternative that really feels more towel like and does a better job of cleaning."
2,Rough and non-absorbent material,"The wipes are small, rough, and not absorbent. My impression of the material is that it felt like fabric softener sheets with a minor coat of Natural's miracle solution. When I wiped my dog's paws, it is mostly just wiping the dirt onto my floor/carpet. When compared to sanitary wipes made by Cottonale meant for human use, I found that the alternative was both cheaper and far more effective.You may very well regret buying this since I definitely felt it was a waste of my money."
2,Trying to clean a collie with a kleenex.,Way too small. I had to use 20 of them on my collie and that just made her damp. I bought them with the idea that it would cut down onthe allegens emitted from the dander. I will have to wait till the allerpet d comes in. I would not buy again.
2,My cats Hate it!,"My wife and I have two cats and I am allergic. We got these to wipe the cats down to keep dander at bay and keep their coats nice. However, when I so much as touch them they RUN! even my long haired cat. Oh well."
3,It's alright,"Too small, too thin, but the smell isn't bad. Not a bad idea if you are using it on a little dog or a cat... or just a dog with short, fine hair... I really rubbed my huskies back and forth with a couple of these and felt that it really freshened and fluffed up their fur. I could probably find better ones for my particular type of dogs though. To be fair, they ARE huskies with very thick fur!"
2,Not great...,"These aren't the worst, but they certainly leave something to be desired. They did clean dirt off my dog's paws, but not a lot of dirt. The texture is weird too. It doesn't ""grab"" the dirt like a cotton wipe would. While I'm wiping a paw or belly the dirt being removed falls from the wipe and onto the floor. I think I would have better luck just using a wet paper towel. I did finish the container since I bought it, but I won't be buying again. I'm off to search out another alternative."
4,Vampire High,This video is not as good as the two other DVDs which were made from the TV Show. There are a lot of breaks which appear to be timed for commercials and it appears to just drag on. I already had the other two DVDs so I bought this one with the hope that it would somehow complete the story. It doesn't really complete anything.
1,Teen Angst as Vampires,"This was a well produced yawn. The budget's all there, but the plot is really dull - a group of teen vampires is sent to an exclusive school so that they can learn how to 'blend-in' with human society - to stop feeding frenzies so that they don't get caught - so because of this there's very little vampire action - aside from a couple of times they face off against each other baring their fangs.If you're after a film about vampires being vampires - this is not it. If you're after a film about teens being teens - then maybe this is for you - teens who just happen to have fangs."
1,ummm 2 thumbs down WAY down,this movie horrible!!! its abruptly end ...im like were the rest of it? its not scarry..its a waste of money.DO NOT BUY NOR RENT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WANT A REFUND OR EXCHANGE!!!!!HONEST IF I COULD ID RATE IT A ZERO
5,The Gospel of Yeshua: A Fresh Look at the Life and Teaching,"Being an unreligious person, I was skeptical of reading a book about Jesus. However, I was delighted that the book was not preachy or overbearing. It is an interesting account of Jesus the man, someone who, throughout my Sunday School years, was exposed to me as a mythical, magical non-human. It is refreshing to read a ""religious"" book that does not make you feel uncomfortable. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
2,Did I read the same book?,"While this novel is has no glaring flaws, I didn't feel that the characters were anything more than simple cut-out figures. The exposition is also less than riveting; I often felt that a travel book or encyclopedia passage was simply grafted into the story, as in this passage: ""At approximately 1,300 feet below sea level, the Jordan empties into the Dead Sea, from which there is no outlet. Water escapes from it only by evaporation. The sea covers 390 square miles, is 1,200 feet deep, and is the lowest spot on earth."" The paragraph continues, but I think it gives some of the flavor of this ""strongly written book"" (quote from the back cover)."
3,Too Basic,"This book is for those who is just starting out. Not exactly ""the"" manual, but it gets you started. If you're looking to advance and keep getting assignments, then get another book. I've been in mystery shopping for 1 month, and I need something further. Not bad for getting your feet wet, though."
2,Very lightweight at best,"""The Mystery Shopper's Manual"" is a light weight casual introduction to the subject of mystery shopping. I found it interesting but not of any particular value. I was very surprised in light of the fact that the author, Cathy Stucker, is the main driving force behind the Gold Certification offered for $75 by the Mystery Shoppers Providers Association (MSPA)and the basic Silver Certification offered for $15. Perhaps the more useful material is being withheld for use in the paid MSPA certification programs. The MSPA should give this book away for free an introductory brochure when someone pays the $15 or $75 for their certification courses.My main criticism is that there is no significant information conveyed by this book - just a very lightweight superficial overview of Mystery Shopping."
1,Almost no good at all,"Just common sense, no ""insider"" knowledge. Everything in this book you could already learn online at various websites for free. And the book itself is poorly produced, pages falling out already. Not recommended!"
3,From a new shopper,"The information seemed repetitive throughout the book. I liked the list of companies that a shopper can register with towards the back of the book. However, the checklist option was of no help to me since I wanted to pass the book on to my daughter. All in all, it was a pleasant read with helpful information for the new shopper."
4,fast and furious,"Received book order, in no-time. Book was in great shape. Saved a lot buying it used. Way to go!"
1,Not for me,"Unless your willing to devote a lot of time and energy with very low return, this book is a waste of time and money.Mystery Shopper's Manual, 6th Edition"
2,A terrible disappointment.,"Attanasio is one of my favorite writers - constantly innovative, frequently lyrical, and until this book he hadn't disappointed me. It's not a bad story, but it falls far below the standard of work that I've come to expect from this man. The first two books in this series are delightful, and as good as anything Attanasio's ever done. I finished this one, however, only to keep up with the series. Rerad this book if you've been drawn into the series, but by no means let it be your introduction to the work of this talented author."
3,'Wolf...' interesting but falls short,"Attansio's interpretation of teh Arthurian legend is fascinating and well-written, but it took this reader nearly 100 pages to become acclimated to the author's bizarre shortened chapters. Attanasio abbeviates his scenes so that they last no longer than 1 1/2 pages at the most.Interestingly, it doesn't appear that his work suffers because of it...yet it was still disconcerting. This was the first Attanasio book I've read. Despite what others have written, it is possible to use this as a jumping-off point into his novels."
2,A disappointment,"I was disappointed to find almost none of the elements in the third installment of Attanasio's treatment of the Arthur cycle that I have read his other books for--it seemed to me that he was out of ideas, hurrying to meet a deadline, or both. The plot was rushed, the usual musical descriptions were all but absent, and there were no significant developments in the story at all. I hope that there will be a fourth volume that is as complex and lush as ""The Dragon and The Unicorn,"" much as ""Last Legends of Earth"" was a worthy follow-up to ""Radix"" after the tepid ""In Other Worlds"" and ""Arc of the Dream."""
4,good watch,"happy with it, basic watch, comfortable strap, bang it around quite a bit with no problems. I wold not hesitate to by another nixon"
4,great book,As someone who was just getting into card making this book was really great for showing all the different techniques that can be used in the craft. I had seen a lot of the materials at the local craft store and wondered of their use. Their are also some great step by step card folding projects. This really helped me get my own creative juices flowing.
1,scam,It is shameful that publishers are reissuing titles previously published under different names. This volume is nothing more than a compilation of previously published work. I could have just thrown my money in the garbage.
3,wheel barrow,The product is very good. The process to receive it was very hectic. I had to return the product once because it was damage upon arrival and the second one that came was nicked up.
4,A great book from one of my favorite Christian authors!,"This is one of my absolute favorite books by Darlene Mindrup! Set against the backdrop of ancient Rome, we meet a Jewish slavegirl named Sara and her mistress' brother, Antonius. The story centers around the time preceding Rome's burning under suspicious circumstances during Nero's reign and is a wonderful tale of a man searching for something to fill the void in his heart and the woman who will help lead him to the truth of Jesus Christ. I recommend this, and any other work by Mindrup. The writing quality is excellent, exciting, and keeps you turning the page. I think I stayed up all night reading this one!"
4,A Haunting Lesson,"The Ghost in Room 11 takes a look at how scary it is to be the new kid in class, which, the story reveals, is not as scary as meeting a ghost. Matt (the new kid) soon learns the value of honesty in new friendships. He also learns the importance of doing your best in school because old teachers don't go away, but they might come back to haunt you. This is a fun book for boys and girls of all ages. Comments: Hannah, grade 2 - ""It was pretty scary when the ghost touched Matt's chin, but I really liked the book."""
5,An excellent introduction to the Korean are of Hwarang Do.,"This is one in a series of books written by the grandmaster of Hwarang Do, Joo Bang Lee. Hwarang Do means ""Way of the flowering youth."" This volume covers the techniques and philosophy of this Korean martial art. This art employes blocks, punches, strikes, kicks, holds, locks, throws and defense as well as how to use several weapons. In conclusion, this book is an excellent introduction to this Korean martial art.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art Myths--Cafe Press)."
5,Everyone should attend a healing mass!,"After attending a healing mass for someone I then read Ms. Parson's book about Fr. Peter. I want to attend another mass! Deeply moving, inspirational and up-lifting. I need a copy of my own! Help, it's out of print!"
5,An attractive supplement,"Although the subtitle of the collection is ""Challenging Problems for Students,"" a fair number of the problems are not difficult or tricky, but do a wonderful job of testing a student's understanding of the major concepts and techniques of elementary linear algebra. Not all of the problems are original, but they are all instructive and interesting. One of my favorites gives a product AB of a 3 x 2 and 2 x 3 matrix and asks for the product BA. The hints and solutions are clear and concise. I particularly appreciated the attractive layout of this text. Notation is chosen carefully, and everything from font size to spacing of text and the display of complex expressions seems to have been considered with utmost concern and respect for the reader. This book is a very good resource for both students and teachers of linear algebra."
2,QUALITY NOT AS GOOD AS OLDER UNITS,"I have used APC UPS's for over 20 years. The batteries used to last 4-5 years before replacement was needed. Not any longer. The 3 SU 750's I have all had the batteries die at about the same time-2.5 years from purchase. I removed the label on these battery packs to discover they are made by some no name companies in China. Have you ever heard of ""Vision "" batteries?. What about a company called ""LONG"". APC is charging premium prices for these battery packs and sending low quality batteries. True, they give you the harness and recycle the batteries for free but we all know that is what we are paying for."
2,Last 2.3 years (way too little) failing with no warning; buying a new unit instead,"These batteries fail WITHOUT WARNING after 2-2.3 years, and when they fail you have no UPS *and* an annoying continuous beeping that you can't mute (while you wait for a new battery. I've just cancelled my order for a replacement battery and am going to get a different UPS instead -- for a few more bucks, you get something that is more powerful, uses up less power (greener and cheaper) and reviewers say it works better."
1,The worst ball ever,I coach girls volleyball for age 12 - 14 I bought 6 ball and within two weeks i'm down to two balls they are not even or round. The balls rip along the seems they are the worst balls I have ever owned. I would never buy these balls again.
1,Volleyball Complaint,We have only had this volleyball for a couple of weeks and the seams have torn and the leather is starting to come apart at the torn seams. It was a waist of money.
1,volleyball,"the volley ball was lopsided,the stiching was cheap and it was ready to fall apart, I cant even play with it."
1,Seam leaks,"Wow, should have listen to the reviews. I took the risk and paid for it. Balls leaks at multiple spots (seam) after a couple days."
4,Great Volleyball,"I was very excited to receive the ball in the mail last week, and I found it to be a very good ball. However, it had a few small tears but nothing too serious. Overall its a great ball for the price and I will buy a few more of this type."
3,Good for recreational use! Get something better if you are playing competitively though.,"I have ordered four of these volleyballs, all of which are perfect for recreational play on the lawn with a bunch of guys who don't exactly follow the rules of volleyball. But for experienced players you may want to get a better ball -- pumped up, all four balls clearly do not feel round. This ball is much more appropriate for outdoor play than indoor play, based on the feel of its padding. But for its purpose for a bunch of college guys playing volleyball and having bbqs, its perfect for its price!"
3,Ok,"I ordered it and was excited to get it. The ball is actually red, white, and black, not the pink looking in the picture. So far it is not super soft like it says, I find it feels like hitting rocks up in the air. Mine was supposed to be brand new, but it has wrinkles and a dent."
3,"great product, wrong color!","Ball was great, but was browner than purple and daughter thought she would like the aqua instead...but when we reordered, they sent a completely different ball...had to send that one back...wish we would have kept the purple brown..if you get the right order, you will be happy with the product."
3,small,"The quality of the balls is good, but we've found that they are smaller than the standard size in schools and volleyball clubs, which wasn't documented in the product description at the time of purchase."
5,Awsome Vollyball,I wanted a softer vollyball for where we play at but atleast it isn't rock hard when blown up. I recomend This ball for any vollyball needing person. This Works well and we havn't any problems with it.
1,Lopsided,"This ball appeared at first to be a good deal, but after playing a few games we figured out that it was badly out of round."
1,"hate it, bad Quality","it only works for one hour, the air wen through the seams out, we couldn't Inflate it again, we try to fix it"
4,Tachikara Volleyball,Purchased as a gift for my grandchildren. They love it and have been playing with it constantly since. Quality is good.
1,deformed,Volleyballs are supposed to be round aren't they?! This one obviously was not inspected before it was shipped. Bummer of a Christmas present!
4,Nice volley ball.,"My granddaughter was thrilled to receive the ball but was disappointed that it immediately needed air before she would start playing with it. Otherwise, it would have been a perfect 5 star."
2,Surface was too hard for younger players. Ball felt heavier than normal.,Ball surface was very tough on arms. Anyone without a long sleeve shirt had bright red marks up and down their arms. Most of the younger/inexperienced players did not want to play with the ball. Ball also felt heavier than a normal ball. Many had a hard time trying to set the ball due to the weight. Would not recommend this model.
3,2nd Time Is Charm,"The 1st order received had a deflated ball in the box. We thought that the ball just needed to be filled with air because they shipped them without. By the time that we got the ball out of the carton, to a friend to fill it with air and realized it had a slow leak we were passed the return deadline and therefore SOL.We re-ordered the same exact volleyball because my 11-year old daughter liked it (when it was inflated) and we have since had no issues. A great volleyball for beginners like my daughter."
1,Bad design on many fronts,"Ah, I was seduced by the color! Unfortunately, after just a couple of months, the enamel coating began to chip off--first along the bottom, then along the top edges. Which of course lets water in to rust the base metal.The round holes in the colander are slightly too big, so spaghetti can slide right out.Also, the 1.5-quart size is just a tad too small for, say, a bunch of greens or a pound of pasta.Good thing I didn't throw out or old workhorse, not-a-pretty-color colander!"
4,James Newton Howard's Score for Blood Diamond a Gem,"James Newton Howard wrote two of the best scores of 2006, and ""Blood Diamond"" may indeed be the very best score of that year. At once dramatic, romantic and poignant, with wonderful, and not overdone, African choral and instrumental motifs this is an outstanding work. As has been written before, Howard always produces at least one main theme which becomes the outstanding centerpiece of his film scores, and he does it again here whether it is with solo piano, chorus, full orchestra or with African effects he excells with his music on this recording. The theme, and its variations, and the score entire all come to a marvelous climax in the last four score cues on this soundtrack album (note ""London"" particularly). Beautifully produced, and nicely packaged by Varese. Sadly, this work seems to have been overlooked by the Academy of Arts and Sciences, but this has happened so many times before."
4,excellent soundtrack,"The music in this CD is very enjoyable, plus it reminds me of the story of the movie,what we can learn from it."
2,Filmmusic to be heard without movie,"I recently saw this movie and was enthousiastic about the music. However as it appears, you must see the motions picture to have an ultimate experience..."
2,Greek to me!,"My experience with Berlitz guides in other languages is very mixed. Berlitz has some of the best teaching guides and they have some of the rest. This travel pack appears to cover some important language situations, but it does not do a good job. A traveler in Greece first needs to conquer the alphabet, and pronounce Greek letters properly. Those of us who learned our Greek pronounciations in an American college fraternity will be shocked to learn the Greeks do not say Beta, they say Veeta, and Phi is pronounced Fee, and so on. Secondly a visitor to Greece should learn how to read the Greek alphabet, so when you see a sign in Greek, or read something (a menu) in Greek, you could begin to translate.They could reduce the number of expressions and variations on the same message and do it more thoroughly."
4,Close,"Compact. However, for the beginner, would have liked a section in the tape with repetitive single word-at-a-time instruction. Sentences come later"
1,Not a good buy,This hat is not designed to look like you expect a baseball cap to look when you wear it. The cap is not cut deep enough to look nice. From the design to the fit this cap is poorly done.
3,Needs more Mansfield,"I have to say I am a fan of Cary Grant but his storyline in this film is just so boring! Grant chews the scenery and tries too hard to come off as a clever written playboy in the Navy. In effect he feels more like Lyle Waggoner, than Cary Grant. I did enjoy Jayne as man hungry girl harassing all the boys on a four day leave. I wished they would of made the film more about the swinging Alice character. Grant's part seems very bland and disposable.When this film came out critics panned Jayne's part for being trashy, in my opinion she's the only redeemable thing about this dated, and predictable movie. It's not any of the actors fault really, the script stinks."
3,Interesting movie but -- Shame on Jayne & director!!!,"I got this movie because I LOVE watching old movies w/Hollywood Bombshells in them like Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Jane Russell etc. & I like Cary Grant. Jayne Mansfield's acting in this film reminds me of the kind of acting one does in highschool -- a far cry from the acting she's done in Rock Hunter & The Girl Can't Help it. Her acting makes her character seem nuttier than a Baby Ruth. Granted Jayne is only in there to be Jayne in the movie -- because she doesn't seem to have anything to do w/the story -- but why couldn't the director bring her acting a bit down to earth a little? & then when she dances with the man who says he'd do anything for her, she gives her signature squeal for 1/2 a minute. If that doesn't cement her looking like a nut, I don't know what does."
3,"Read the book, ""Shore Leave"".","I thought I might buy this film until I read some of the reviews and tried to picture the stars in the roles created by Frederic Wakeman in his wonderful novel, ""Shore Leave"". I will not buy the film and just reread for the upteenth time the novel."
2,NOT TYPICAL,"Boring. This movie just drags on, and you tend to loose concentration in it. I'm sad to say, but I didn't even finish watching it. I've never done that with a Cary Grant movie before this one.Cary Grant is probably one of my all-time favorite actors...but this movie is just BORING!"
2,Kiss them off,"I make it a habit to check out Cary Grant movies but the more I see the lesser known movies, the more I realize that Grant was a single-facetted actor. Mind you, that cool, suave delivery of his is a real show-stopper but the two or three dramatic (not romantic) scenes in ""Kiss them for Me"" were embarassingly forced indignation. I admit that when I read the plot before I saw the movie, I couldn't envision Cary Grant as part of a threesome that puts on a wild four-day party. And he didn't fit the role as he sort of wandered in and out of the hijinks. It may have been good acting to appear oblivious of the ever-present Jayne Mansfield but the suave act was out of place with most of this script.I'll still give Grant a chance to show his unique talent. However, the recent viewings of ""Houseboat"", ""Walk, Don't Run"", ""Kiss Them for Me"" and a couple other turkeys have shown me that his later years were spent making a lot of movies that he shouldn't have."
3,"Not a great Cary Grant movie, not a bad movie","""Kiss Them For Me"" is a 1957 movie staring Cary Grant as Commander Andy Crewson who is able to get four days shore leave for himself and three of his buddies in San Francisco. While there, they meet women (Jayne Mansfield, Suzy Parker), old friends from the navy and when they are offer safe state-side jobs, these fun loving flyers realize that being in combat with buddies is what matters most.For me, these was not the best Cary Grant movie that I have seen so far. But it was pretty decent, but clearly Grant's earlier works were better."
1,Cheaper than Ambien as a sleeping aid.....,"In his later years, Cary Grant wasn't so picky about what films he did, as long as the paycheck was there. This bomb is one reminder of Grant's many mis-fires, and one that will surely put you to sleep while watching it, as it is quite dull and boring. Although certain viewers can enjoy moments here to admire the physical attributes of Jayne Mansfield, most people will be downright bored by this dull movie. It was a failure when released to theaters, and remains so now.A DUD!"
3,"""saved"" by the last track","This may be Roach's/Obmana's weakest collaboration. Not that it is a bad one but I expected more. It is in a more atonal style than their other collaborations and the presence of tribal/ethnic elements (drumming,sampled indian prayers etc) is strong in almost all tracks. Unfortunately it becomes tiresome soon enough, mostly due to the lack of drifting and atmospheric keyboard ""support"". Thus, the final result is somehow raw. Some may find this approach interesting but for me it is far from the sound that made me fond of these musicians.The above don't apply to the ""The Graceful Sky"" which is a bright exception, very different in an outstanding way from the other tracks and a perfect way to make you wonder if it was meant to be on another CD. In my opinion this track is one of their best. Maybe it's the artwork or the song titles or just my feeling, but somehow I find it as the perfect Autumn soundtrack. A perfect conclusion to a rather mediocre CD."
3,Not the best of Steve Roach,"I have every CD that has been released by Steve Roach and although most anything that Steve does is light years ahead of other artists of his ilk, this is not his most memorable of the Roach collection."
4,Wheeewi!!!!!,"This strange, out-of-planet sounding music is ambient at its best. Best sounding while taking a long midnite drive through Long Island's Mary Pitken Path, in the luxoriously rich commune of East Shoreham. cameo-guest Steve Roach provides warm organic frog-esque toots with his trademark horn, hand-crafted by an Aborgine tribe known as Kjenikobnomaqicunk. All-in-all, this album will remind you of of those rainy days, just before you quit sniffing glue and decided to become a podiatrists' assistant. Little known fact: Some of the unidentified vibratto sounds are created by a fibre optic microphone inserted by Stephen into his femallian reciprocational unitarian component's solidified organic exhaust phloem."
3,Mislead and disappointed but Amazon came through!,"Imagine my suprise and disappointment in opening my box to find one wine glass. The title stated ""glassES"" as did the written description mention ""SET"" and ""glassES"". Before ordering I checked the price on other sites and found singles of this wine glass for $3.99. I knew there was NO way that Amazon would sell an item for more than double the price on other sites and thought I was getting a truly great value set. Wrong! Do not buy this unless you want to spend $36 to get a set of four plastic glasses.After writing this review, I contacted Amazon customer service who immediately addressed my disappointment. I was issued a credit for the item and advised the wording will be corrected. Who could ask for more? The glass itself is very nice as long as the buyer is aware of what they are getting for their money."
4,pricey,was kinda shocked to see i was one getting one. my misunderstanding. I glass it self is very nice and durable
1,Suede Upper Separates from rubber sole,"I ordered these boots for my son for a Christmas gift. He occasionally wore them for about 3 weeks (not daily) when the suede upper of the L boot separated from the rubber sole. Amazon was great with the return and getting another pair out promptly. The replacement boots arrived 1-22-07. He wore them for 4-5 hours total on 1-25, 1-26-, and 1-27 and the same thing happened again. I am now working with Warmbat for a replacement pair of boots as I think that there must be some sort of problem - at least with the sz 9 chocolate brown boots. The boots are warm and beautiful but I'll followup on this review after we receive pair #3."
5,Great challenge,"Wonderful puzzle, not as easy as it looks, but is not redundant because of the many details in the image. It was a real brain teaser."
5,Friend loved it.,This was a Christmas gift. The friend who received it loved it. I will buy more in the future. Thanks
3,Beautiful even if the image is fake,"This puzzle was fun, not too easy but not impossible. The sky was quite a challenge. The only disappointment was realizing that not only isn't it a photo of NYC, it couldn't be because of the relative positions of the monuments. The image is totally fake. It looks great framed on the living room wall, though."
5,My first Ravensburger Puzzle,"I bought this puzzle 3 weeks ago as a Christmas present for myself. It is absolutley beautiful and I am not finished it yet. I read previous reviews and got some posterboard so I can do the puzzle on my floor. My coffee table is not quite big enough for a 2000 piece. I work full time although i am off for a few days since i injured my ankle. I just finished all of the buildings, the river and bridge, now the toughest part the sky. I will be having it framed after i finish the puzzle. The cost of framing it will be expensive but it is worth it since it's a beautiful puzzle."
2,Pretty lame,"Ok the reason this movie got even two stars was cuz the cars were pretty decent. I saw this for rent at a video store one day and being a big fan of the import racing scene I had to see it. It was so lame, it was about like drug dealers and gangs and all that crap. The closest thing to racing in this was a chase on a highway. Not worth the money I paid to rent it. Don't make the same mistake I did cuz ur wasting ur time."
1,no video,unable to connect to video from ipod 4g all i get is sound and that is not what the description say's about the product
2,Review pending on Video ipod 30GB,"Today is 4/12/08, just ordered the the universal video cable. It will arrive 4/18/08, look for follow up from me if it really works great with the video ipod 30GB? I will post the truth...stay tuned friends"
3,Heads Up: Does Not Work with iPod Classic,Just a heads up for you Classic owners - this cable doesn't work with the iPod Classic.
1,doesn't work with my iPod Classic,"This item was cheap, so I'm not really upset, but it didn't work with my iPod Classic, for video, the audio worked fine. Even after I switched to video out, it did nothing."
1,"Not Happy, Wasted my Money","The ad said it would work with my Classic ipod, it doesn't. You will only get audio. You will need to purchase a much more expensive device from Apple for the Classic to play the video. I wasted my money on this one. Although it was cheap the shipping wasn't."
2,too many pieces the same color,"I have done Ravensburger 3,000 piece puzzles, they were hard, but loved doing them. I started this one and too, too many pieces all the same color, pieces were too small and took more room then I expected. Put it away after a few days, doubt if I will do it."
4,Too many pieces for a gift,"Had to send item back, purchased as a gift, but 5000 pieces were too many for the person I purchased for. If you love puzzles and have the room, you would probably like this gift"
1,Too hard,"We like puzzles. This one is printed very darkly and is ridiculous for sorting pieces. After awhile, we just gave up."
4,depends on your problem,"These are the best inserts I've found, short of $400, custom-made, prescription-only orthotics. A physical therapist recommended them. She said they're popular with runners. They're fairly bulky -- the only shoes I can use them with are my athletic shoes (New Balance); and they've even stretched those out a bit. They provide comfortable padding for the bottom of your foot and a really firm arch support. I recently saw an orthotic specialist, who told me these inserts are ""neutral"", by which he meant that they're level. They will not correct pronation. For that, you'd need something that tilts your foot OUT. On the other hand, the good arch support prevents your foot from going completely flat. I wear them every day; they've held up well."
3,There's been better.,"They were shipped quickly, but they really aren't that comfortable and they rubbed down quite quickly, which is really a shame because I need them for everyday. I finally had to change the type that I was using within a couple of weeks."
5,A good book for learning skills,"This is a good book, and it covers many things. My favorite is the projectiles section. It shows how to make different kinds of spear throwers among other things. very interesting. I cant wait to get out and try some of this stuff. It is not a survival book by any means, but it's not supposed to be a survival book. It is just what the title says; a book of earth skills, and it lives up to this name."
2,Very old content,"The cover of the book is nice and colorfull but the content is too old with only poor and blurred black & white pictures, you cannot recognize what is being shown."
5,Primitive Technology,Some very technical articles but really a good resource book for the amateur and full-time archeologist. I am enjoying and learning from this purchase on a daily basis.
1,unreadable,"The text is meh, the illustrations are nearly impossible due to their size and print clarity. An amusing book to flip through, but if you think you're going to really learn anything practical from it (and its diagrams) think again."
2,Primitive Technology,The book is an overview of a wide range of skills and lacks details on how on how to do them.
3,"Good, But NOT the best out there....","The info and presentation of this book are good, but these wonderful folks can't hold a candle to Tom Brown, Jr. He is the best and presents the ""whole"" of nature and Mother Earth. If you are interested in the deeper meanings of nature try Tom Brown, Jr."
5,Great Buy,"I got these for my mom for her birthday and she LOVES them! She wanted some fashional/dressy sneakers. She says they are so comfortable and she loved the look of them, as do it. I bought size 8.5, which is her normal size, and they fit perfect."
1,broke right away!,"I bought these shoes a couple of months ago (it's Christmas time, I bought them sometime in the Fall) They are incredibly comfortable and light, and fit perfect like all of my other sketchers, but the sides blew out within about a month of wearing them. They probably had about 9 miles of use on them total.Edit: Had them for 4 months now and as I was walking down the stairwell yesterday the entire sole fell off my right foot and sent me tumbling down the concrete steps. I will be contacting Amazon for a refund, this is absolutely unacceptable."
3,u. s. seals 2 ---APPROVED!,"I read all of the reviews before and most of you made some really good points. while I agree with the one person who hated the movie, just remember this is a low-budget-chop socky-military slightly based action movie. it is fun, a joke and best of all a total popcorn movie. everyone!?----sit back put your brain on hold and enjoy. I have seen some really wretched movies but at least this was fun."
1,Worst seal movie ever!,"Wow from the bad acting to the improper military uniforms. It was more like a very low budget martial arts movie, the movie had 1960's batman sound effects like whooossss, womp, pow, swish,and ect. The movie looks like it had no military adviser to help choreography the movie at all. Not much i can say, i think i lost like 20 brain cells watching the movie lol. Long story short stay away from this movie, bad acting, bad special effects and bad sound effects to go along with all the lame one liners that don't make any sense at all."
4,"Shut your mouth, this is a great Kung Fu movie","Prior to watching this, I thought that it would be like the Delta Force movies which involve a lot of machine gun action. U.S. Seals 2 is actually a Kung Fu movie with very little machine gun action. The fighting choreography is very well done. The fighting looked very realistic and exciting. I enjoyed this movie a lot.The plot is a little cheesy. It's a typical B movie situation where a scientist gets kidnapped by a madman who wants to extort the government for ransom money."
2,"Way, WAY too much...","This movie is overdosing on action. A guy gets kicked in the face and does a triple-whirl in the air before falling to the ground. The plot makes James Bond look intelligent and the action scenes are completely chaotic. I suppose the film's one saving grace is that it's much better than the first. A group of U.S. Seals (not Navy SEALS) is sent to an island to stop a megalomaniac from firing a missile. There is tons of violence that never stops to take a breath of air. The fight scenes, though well done, are completely ludicrous and highly unbelievable. It steps down into kung-fu territory, but still wants the viewer to believe it's an intelligent, Clancy-like thriller. It's not."
4,Not an award winner but this film takes [nothing] from anyone,"Ok the plots predictable, and the sound effects are pushed well over the limit to the point its laughable. But the action is awesome!!! If you liked blade II then you'll love this film. The only thing that ticked me off in the film(besides the main bad guy smoking cigars that should detonate the entire island), is the asian chick was featured way to much. Which is why I gave the film 4 stars. Note this film is for action fans only!!!!"
1,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T SEE IT!!!!!,"(...) why this movie was made i dont know, but the man who was responsible for it should be considered a criminal. i only rented it because there were two rowes of it gone and only one left, only god knows why. and it was the worst 40 minutes ever, i couldnt make ot through any more than that. bottom line, dont see it."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this book. It started off with such promise but by the middle I was thoroughly bored. I had a really hard time getting through the last half of this book. I could not seem to connect with these characters. Marcus was so overbearing and jealous and Jenny was just too ""niave"" to put it nicely. The only thing they seem to have in common was their sexual attraction for each other but there wasn't any sex going on!"
3,Good But Not Great,"It sounds more mature than the DLG albums but it also sounds way too sleepy. He sings better and without too much of that R&B wailing. The salsa songs are too soft or light specially when produced by Sergio George. The best songs are not the salsa songs and the worst songs are 3, 6, and 7. If you liked the way Huey Dunbar sang for DLG, you will be pleased, but musically it is a step down."
2,Just an ok CD,"While I miss DLG, I think Dunbar's solo efforts have been good. However, one of the things that really drives me crazy is that he cannot sing in Spanish. At least he's learned that he doesn't have to sing every word of every song at the top of his lungs--in ""Cambio de Que"" he shows some vocal nuances that are nice, although he still likes to force the bravado technique. Overall, the CD is just OK."
3,EL DUO DE HUEY CON LUCERO,"HUEY ES TREMENDO CANTANTE Y DEBE APROVECHAR SU VOZ, INCURSIONANDO EN OTROS GENEROS. PERO LO FELECITO PORQUE ESCOGIO A UNA DE LAS MAS GRANDES VOCES QUE TIENE MEXICO, QUE ES NUESTRA LUCERO, EN DONDE EL DUO ESTA GENIAL Y EN VERDAD DEBEN PROMOVER A ESTAS DOS ESTRELLAS PRESENTANDOLOS JUNTOS CANTANDO ESTA CANCION, LO OI Y LA VERDAD SON DOS EXCELENTE VOCES REALES, DESDE PANAMA TE ESCRIBE JHONNY Y UNA VEZ MAS LA CANCION CON LUCERO EXCELENTE."
4,Huey Dunbar-Cantante para el Milenio,"Este Huey si sabe como cantar, no? A mi me gusta la cancion ""Con Cada Beso"" las dos versiones. Tiene un estilo muy bueno y palabras que mueven a cualquier person especial mente la version salsa. Compren este CD, se los garatizo que lo van a disfrutar."
4,nothing I'd kick out of punk rock bed...,"Not nearly as ferocious or enduring as the classic ""Wacky Hi-Jinx Of..."" album but hearing it again after maybe 20 years or so I found myself enjoying it about as much as I did then. AOD is NJ's finest ever band, bar none. Bruce stinks, less said about Bon Jovi the better, that leaves AOD. Loud, reckless, teetering on the brink of total silliness for no reason other than because they can. Genuflect promptly, then continue mowing the Garden State in tribute. AOD is sorely, sorely missed."
3,Pretec DC-600 review,"Good entry-level camera with good memory expansion capabilities (up to 32 MB), but very slow processing time (6-7 seconds) between taking or reviewing pictures. Poor indoor picture quality even when using the flash. As with most digital cameras, using the display eats batteries faster than you can replace them."
4,Useful for Conversation Class/tutoring,"I use this as the main text in a small group Spanish Conversation Class. There are six high school aged students who have had between two and three years of instruction, and one adult who actually lived in South America, but wants an update on her language skills.The pros are: Interesting conversation and easy to follow dialogues and grammar/phrase points in each chapter. Nice small size, and not overwhelming.The cons: No vocabulary list for each chapter, so the students are a little all over the map for keeping track of the vocabulary their adding to their repertoire, and this makes ""quizzes"" a little more difficult.Overall, the students enjoy the lay out.It is of course an advanced book, so for an introduction or for younger students, Flip Flop Spanish is good, which comes with a CD. (I do wish it came WITH CD's, not separately, but that's a VERY small flaw.)"
3,A lot of old catalog pictures.,"This book mostly has old catalog photos, which don't exactly help you much. Three quarters of this book is in black and white photo's. Pictorial with little imformation."
3,"""Borrowed"" Track from the Ventures...lose 2 stars.","Black sand Beach is actually a Ventures' number called ""Showdown at Newport."" I heard the Ventures do it live back in 1982 and I still have an autographed promotional copy of the 45.I know the Japanese LOVE the Ventures, but not very cool to put out what appears to be all-originals and by the 3rd track, you're ripping off Edwards-Bogle-Wilson-Taylor."
2,Dissapointment,"I guess I was expecting something more after hearing a few songs by Darkest Hour, namely The Patriot Virus and Sadist Nation. Most of this album is tedious and boring. I think this band is for teenagers that want to listen to hard music, but don't know any better. There are way too many mediocre metal bands out there, and this is one of them.Sadist Nation 4/5Pay Phones and Pills 2/5Oklahoma 1/5Marching to the Killing Rhythm 3/5Misinformation Age 2/5Seven Day Lie 2/5Accessible Losses 3/5Patriot Virus 5/5 their best songVeritas, Aequitas 0/5 pointless"
2,"A NOISY, VOICELESS ALBUM. With a bonus DVD!","NOISY, it is the type of metal that want to be heavy, the bad ones, the ""Darkest"", and the only thing they do is to play there instruments like animals and without any skill.VOICELESS, it vocalist only screams without sense, or understanding what he is saying.This have a sticker that says ""Limited edition with a bonus DVD, and a bonus track""The DVD is a homevideo that they make with little pieces of concerts and ""Sadist Nation"" live from ""HellFest"", with garbage live song played like in a garage.I put two stars because some people like these bands, but the quality of the recording, instruments and ""Bonus DVD"" for my opinion are so bad that it should have 0 stars"
3,Over Rated Trimmer,"I got this trimmer a couple years ago and have been disappointed ever since the warranty expired. It wasn't expensive and giving it was a Troy-Bilt product I bought it. After a few months it didn't want to start like it did when purchased. However, with the 1 year warranty, I decided to keep it. Once the motor gets a little warm it runs quite well, but shuts off if you keep it on certain angels. Further, I had to replace the twine head... it bind up during use and I damaged it during the disassembling to repair. Unfortunately, I had to go with a universal head because the replacement head was temporary unavailable. Nonetheless, it cuts grass and weeds very good. I just wished it worked as well as the lawn mower I bought."
5,Southern Fried Blackened Death Metal,"Imagine if you take the dark, eerie morbid melodies of Emperor and Darkthrone and mix them with the death-sludge of Acid Bath and Soilent Green. Thus is the spawn of the band Goatwhore.With Funeral Dirge, Goatwhore tends to go a different direction from their ""The Eclipse of Ages Into Black"", in which their previous album was more black metal. This is now a blackened death metal CD with excellent drumming and vocals that reminscence Soilent Green as well as black metal. It's not something you'll hear everyday. It's not a Myrkskog/Zyklon/Panzerchrist clone, but rather a band of its own league. And this is why ""Funeral Dirge"" should belong in the collection of all extreme metal fans."
4,Decent Clementi CD,"I'm not familiar with all those Clementi sonatas except op.7 no.3 that I play, and thought it would be good to get my first Clementi CD with a familiar work on it. The playing is quite decent, with a sort of period playing style, however I expect a little modern approach. Still op.7 no.3 sonata is the most interesting sonata on the disk which has a kind of tragic tone over its 1st and 3rd movements, but the pianist didn't seem to quite get it. Another sonata op.8 no.1 is also good."
2,VERY disappointing,"This game's graphics are quite good, and the action taking place on a rolling, wind & ocean swept freighter is novel. However, this game is completely ruined by the inability to move your character around via the mouse (you have to use the keyboard!) -- which means your character is moving around as if he were a main battle tank. And most of the action takes place in third person viewpoint, along with a moving camera at your back or your side. Painfully annoying!There are also no maps in the game, so expect to re-tread old ground a lot.You cannot save the game when and where you want -- and there are only so many save slots when you are actually permitted to save.The game is rather short, but you won't really care about that, because most people will not even wish to finish Cold Fear.This is one of those very poor ports from a game console, where the developers didn't care to get it right for the PC. They just didn't care at all..."
5,A Journey of Faith,Milli shares her heartwrenching journey as a testimony to others who are dealing with head injured family members in such an encouraging and hopeful manner. This book should be required reading for those in this situation.
5,Beautiful songs,This was a gift for my grandson's school. I bought the three Cds. because all the songs are beautiful and the kids like this a lot.
2,God.. this is not a video ?? what an expensive !!,"I thought 3 packages of super simple song were videos. I bought this because I watched the video of super simple song on youtube.but once it's arrived, I put the CDs on the computer, I was really diappointed. they are just music !!!If it is.. too expensive !! about 75 songs for $65 ?? -_-; do you think this is good price? I dont think so.I'm considering to return it."
1,re:poor condition,totall unacceptable.shipped as a bag of peanuts.condition of product was in very poor condition.was too embarrassed to give as a gift.
4,Great suit,"Excellent suit. Very elegant yet comfortable material. My only complaint is that Ralph Lauren suits are cut a little larger than needed. Mine needed some substantial tailoring but once it was done, it felt great."
1,horribly written,"i purchased this book prior to a trip to cozumel this summer, hoping for a quick, light read and some local color. if you don't mind redundancy, very simple sentences (""see jane run"") and misspelled words, then this book should be great for you. i ultimately said hasta nunca to ""the tourist"" and my copy now resides at a pink beach house on the yucatan!"
3,Grinning like the Treasure Cat,"I just finished this book and I must admit I was surprised to see all the mistakes in this book. Grammar-wise - your instead of you're and vice versa, it's instead of its. Misuse of words - his body became ridged - instead of rigid and so forth. The reference to the Treasure Cat instead of the Cheshire cat, a man driving a Volkswagen Gulf instead of a Golf. Capitalized words when there is no need for capitalization. OK I must admit I do proofreading as part of my job, but these mistakes just seemed to jump out at me. I kept turning the pages just to see how many more I could find. I think the book would make a good movie, maybe then I woodn't bee looking for all the misteaks."
3,Fast-paced mystery in an exotic location,"The story line was very good and moved along at a great pace. However, the writing style lost my vote. This would make a great ""book on tape."" It's written in a straightforward descriptive style throughout. Most ""best sellers"" and other novels have a much more sophisticated and interesting writing style. If you don't care about style, you'll give the book a 5."
1,NOT 1/35 scale...Seller needs to pay attention,This is advertised as 1/35 scale but it isn't even as large as 1/72. DON'T buy this kit...ad is deceptive and you'll waste your $$$$$.
5,After reading this book I married my son...!,"Last fall, my son and my now daughter-in-law asked me to marry them. Ann Evans' book provided the three of us with all that we needed to plan and conduct the ceremony. It was a wonderfully meaningful event for the entire family. Since I am neither a minister nor the captain of a ship, I needed to be licensed by the County to conduct the ceremony. With guidance from this book, we designed the day, including writing the ceremony. It was quite an adventure! Thanks, Ann Evans!"
2,Not very good...,I did not find this book very helpful compared to a other books available on the subject....found it to be poorly written. Was laced with to many of the authors ideas on religious views....
3,Moderately useful,"...for anyone beyond the absolute beginner level. Ana Forrest is an amazing yogi,but although it is billed as beginner to advanced, it is really just for beginners, with some excellent tips and adjustments. I was hoping to get some tips for my own practice ( I consider myself an intermediate student), but again, it is really just for beginners.Also, though amazing to watch, Ms. Forrest takes up a great deal of the tape showing what she can do. Struck me as alot of ego for such an accomplished yogi, but maybe that's just me."
3,"Grist for exam questions, be vigilent against anything outdated","To me the only value of this book is to use the quiz and exam questions for preparation purposes. If you're going to take the CPA exam, you benefit from having a large set of sample exam questions. Just take caution not to waste time on any topics that have changed since 2002."
4,great product,"I had been looking for the nusole corn and callus razor with blades in australia, but found exactly what I wanted on amazon. The product is just great for the corn under my foot and does a great job, so easy to use, would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone. It does a great job, just as good as a podiatrist and a lot cheaper."
2,"Service was great, video and audio quality bad","Service from 47st Photo was good, but the video and audio quality of this training series is a bad. I can not believe Elite Video would release this. At times you have to turn the volume way up, only to have the next chapter blast you out of your seat. Video cuts etc are just not what I am use too from Elite Video. IT appears extremely rushed.Stick to buying Blue Cranes Video on the Canon 20D it is awesome.This one is not worth the cost of the DVD's they are on."
5,Poems by two Roses,"This slim volume of poems offers an intimate introduction to a deep and personal relationship between a mother and daughter, and affords the reader great pleasure in the images and language employed by two very different personalities. The mother, Rose Morgan Moore, wrote poems that are romantic, passionate, and intense. Her imagery is rich with references to an idealized nature with a special fondness for spring, April and the color blue. However, her language is very much of the 20th century, and however strong her sentiment, her muse is never sentimental. The daughter, Rose Moore Tomlin, writes with a short spare line that conveys vivid images reminding me of hai-ku poetry. Near the end of the collection, the two merge their efforts in expressions of inconsolable loss and consolation with the poems ""Cremation"" and ""Re-Creation"". The volume is beautifully designed and is a credit to Sea Oats Press. This is a very special collection that lovers of poetry will treasure."
5,The REAL Henry Johnson,"You know that feeling of disappointment when you buy a new CD and after listening to the first two tracks you keeping hitting the ""Forward"" button looking for something better? I assure you that you will not have that problem with Organic! This is an instant ""top ten"" for your collection, especially if it is a collection long overdue for a fine B-3/jazz guitar sound. It's all good; smoking guitar lines augmentment by driving sax and Henry's best vocals ever (those years with Joe Williams really paid off.) Nancy Wilson adds that rare ""touch of class"" or perhaps I should say a ""touch of classic"" to this musical experience. Jazz does not get any better than this."
4,Henry Johnson & Nancy Wilson,I mainly bought this CD for the pure reason that my favorite artist Nancy Wilson was on it.This is for all Nancy Wilson lovers.I have every one of Ms. Wilson's recordings & was more than happy to add this CD to my vast collection.Ms. Wilson's rendition of songs in *duets with Mr. Johnson are very interesting indeed. A must for all Nancy Wilson fans .
2,toy is not same in picture,"I searched a number of sights to make sure the doll I purchased -was the exact doll I wanted because there are a number of different versions...their picture shows the doll with a plastic like face(what I was looking for) however the package recieved was a doll with a flat,painted on face-(what I was exactly trying to avoid) I am very sad-I did not get what I ordered-Customer service did apologize-but it is not worth spending the return postage for an exchange of the right one- I asked them to correct the picture as it is misleading.Maybe they will send me the right version-as a christmas gift-if they do-I will donate the two I purchased to charity."
3,Picture is not accurate,"I still love the plush, but people should be warned that the picture is not accurate. This product has a flat printed face on it. If you're looking for something more like the picture, go to thinkgeek and pay a little more."
2,Disappointing,Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before I purchased this toy. It is not a sweet plush toy with a 3D face that I saw in some toy shop and the one I actually purchased from Amazon based on the image and the product description.This toy has a painted face and is much different from the one shown in the picture. For me it is too much trouble to send it back.However I am really disappointed. It would be great if the Amazon changed the picture. I would never purchase the toy I received.
5,Western music with an Eastern twist,"Who couldn't love an album that includes sitars, chanting, fiddling, and yodeling? This CD is a funky mix of all of the above, with lyrics that make you think and laugh. I like every song on the CD and it hasn't been out of my changer since it arrived. If you are a fan of the defunct Lost Gonzo Band, you will welcome the return of Livingston and his introspective, thoughtful songs. My children took one look at this CD and told me I was listening to hippie music. They're right--but it's hippie music updated for this century."
4,WOW!,"We need more music that can touch you in the way this cd does. The last song ""My Worship is Foreal"" is awesome. It can take you straight to worship and make you forget everything that's going on."
3,Tell The Devil I'm Back,"The current CD, ""Betta"", was so good, I was inspired to purchase previously released CDs by the same artist. I enjoy this CD.However, the current release is all good."
3,Beware of What Edition You Buy,"I'm giving this book three stars because, in my view, Hammett's writing is always superb. However, a strong caveat - the Amazon review system does not clearly distinguish between various editions of this work. I was looking forward to reading the Sam Spade short stories, and early versions of the Thin Man so you can imagine my disappointment (and returning books from NZ is a hassle) that the edition I purchased (the Boomer Books effort) contains none of those items."
3,Interesting but not his best,"The book is worth reading for a Hammett fan, but if you're interested in his best stories try The Big Knockover instead."
5,Dashiell Hammett Reader!,"This book contains stories written during different phases of Hammett's literary career. They mostly belong to the hardboiled genre, but their distict styles make it the most 'representative' book by Hammett. You will find Continetal Op stories here, as well as those involving amateurs. You will find grim action-packed stories, ands there are a few poignant few. There is an extremely intriguing draft of ""The Thin Man"", which, I am sure, has been tempting numerous mystery writers to take up for 'completion' keeping Hammett's style intact. Most of the stories are terrific, and even the weaker ones are readable (an astounding feat for someone who kept writing only for commercial reasons!). Hence, recommended."
3,"Good for the historical pulp flavor, but flawed","As a long-time fan of 'classic' noir/detective fiction (Hammett, Chandler, MacDonald, Thompson) and it's stylistic roots in the pulps, I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed with this volume. There's alot here in terms of sheer number of stories, but aside from the very worthwhile Sam Spade shorts (which bump it to 3 stars), it's very uneven in quality. Your taste buds will like the delicious descriptive and atmospheric elements (particularly for hard-core Chandler fans like me...his inspirations via Hammett are in good supply) but the story construction leaves much to desire. The better part of the book is made up of hastily conceived vignettes that will remind you just as to why most of 'pulp' writing was considered disposable."

2,Dumb Luck,The library brought a stock of new arrivls to my cell the other day and I thought I give this CD a try. Wow.... if I were allowed out of here for a couple of hours I'd send Mr. Silberman a nice package.
5,"CUTE, CUTE, CUTE","Too bad I could only get these in one size, my size. I would have loved to get them for all my girls."
1,Can't read cards over 512MB; only reads SD cards!,"Description when I bought this product said it worked with SD and MS, but it only works with SD cards, not memory sticks. Also, can only read cards that are 512MB or smaller. Guy with a Russian accent is only one who answers the manufacturer's support line, and he's a moron. He kept saying that it reads all photo cards and tried to tell me that a memory stick isn't a photo card. He hung up on me when I asked for a supervisor, and then when I called abck he tried to tell me something else.CAN ONLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU WANT TO CARRY AROUND A BUNCH OF 512MB CARDS. It worked for an old 256MB SD card, but you'd be uploading pictures pretty often with such a small card in your camera."
1,Not iPhone or iPod touch compatible,"Plain and simple. I wasn't concerned about the limited capacity, but i wish I could have more easily determined that this thing didn't work on the touch. Right away the device indicated an error on the screen ""this device is not compatible.It must be returned."
4,Tantalizing Taste...,"... of the behind-the-scenes design, artwork, and storyboarding for the first two Next Generation movies, ""Generations"" and ""First Contact."" Indispensible to a real starship hardware fan, this book gives plenty of details and is interspersed with interviews, recollections, and notes from some of the principal talents involved in creating the location sets, some of the special effects, and the new ships seen in both films, as well as much unseen material from the design of the Borg presence. I found the evolution of the Enterprise-E, Phoenix warp ship, and Vulcan ship from First Contact especially interesting. My only criticism is that, even at 340+ pages, there is not enough! First Contact alone should occupy a 400-page ""Making of"" book. Nevertheless, this volume is a gem which belongs in the library of any hard-core Trek devotee."
3,A bit confusing...,"Please let me start by stating I am a fan of this author. Not only her music and books but have met her several times and witnessed her in various situations. She represents the name of ""Christ"" or ""Christian"" well.My frustration came upon receiving the book; finding she isn't the author of these stories but the ""editor"" of someone else's experiences. For me, that was a let down, a bit misleading and odd.The book is a ""coffee table"" or gift book with well ""edited"" content offering stories, poems and quotes regarding sibling experiences. It is not a personal experience from the author herself."
1,Irritation,"I know it warns you that these may irritate your skin, but I couldn't keep them on for more than 5 minutes. And I had a nice rash for the next few days to deal with.DD cup is a joke--I might have been wearing nothing. These provided no lift or shape for me."
1,Not made for women with big breasts,"I do not recommend these if you are over a c cup. First of all when you go to place them on your breasts they crease so bad and it is so hard to get them smooth. They do not give your breasts a lift like a regular bra. Tried wearing a backless halter top dress, it just looked funny with the sticky bra on."
2,Not worth the purchase,"I'll make this short and sweet. The first compilation was way better than this one. The first song(A cover of U2's ""New Years Day"") isn't all that bad, I'd probably listen to it a few times before getting sick of it. Otherwise, the rest of the tracks really have nothing to offer. Also, DJ Irene's on this. DJ Irene is absolutely terrible, and anything she touches ends up turning into crap, such as her rendition of Blue Monday!"
5,House at Pooh Corner,"This is a delightful book, but more pictures would have been nice for the children of this age group."
5,A touching audio-experience.,"Peter Dennis has the great gift of a fantastic voice, a superb understanding of the text and a real sense for Alexander Milne's fine humor. He definitely brings back childhood memories of the older kids and surely contributes to new ones.I had received the original version of ""The House At Pooh Corner"" as a birthday present from an English family across the road. ""We"" were four at that time and - being German speaking - not really capable of understanding a single word. Every evening I would press my mother to translate, because I loved this book so much.Now ""we"" are fourty something and pretty capable of reading and writing English texts. Nonetheless, I once in a while endulge myself by playing Peter Dennis' tapes of ""The House at Pooh Corner"" and ""Now We Are Six"". They are my favorites. Peter Dennis' recordings of these books are a most delightful audio-experiences for kids of all ages."
5,unbear-ably sad...,"yes, the book is a masterpiece... but for those raised on the movies, even ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" which purports to be about the final chapter, i doubt any parent could really read this to their 6 or 7 year old. (I have to wonder if the other reviewers actually read the final chapter...) it's unbearably sad, really. maybe when my children are a little older I can read it to them... i get all teared up just thinking about it now..."
5,Seal and Bearing Driver set,Works great. I have used many of the drivers on my '65 Mustang rebuild and they have worked flawlessly. This kit offers a nice selection of sizes. Comes in a sturdy plastic case.
5,Must have for suspension jobs,Great set of races to have. There are plenty of sizes and they are also tapered. Good use to press in and out suspension bushings.
4,seal driver kit,A must if you do brake work which requires replacing grease seals. Makes replacing bearing races a breeze. It also works well on spark plug tube seals.
1,waste of money,"I usually don't write reviews on non-functioning gear but this camera wasn't any good when it did work. Look elsewhere. For a similar price point look at the Olympus Stylus 410D.I bought the Vivitar because I had one of their film cameras and liked it, big mistake. Stick with name brands when it comes to cameras like Olympus, Canon, Panasonic, Nikon, and Sony. If you can't find one of those brands for the same price as this you aren't looking hard enough.Also think about a camera that doesn't run on AA batteries but on its own Lithium battery as they hold a charge better."
2,"Eats batteries, totally unreliable in cool temperatures, does not save date.","This little camera does fine in warm/hot temperatures and has great picture quality, but runs through batteries at an unbelievable pace. Also, you're lucky if you can get 3 or more pictures if the ambient temperature is below 40 degrees. Another annoying feature that I wish I had known about is that there is no memory battery, meaning that everytime you change the main batteries (which is quite frequently) the camera totally resets and you have to set the date all over again. This is a pain. All that being said, I took this camera on a trip to Taiwan recently and I was very pleased with the pictures it produced. It's not the best, and could be improved in several ways, but it's not the worst 5MP camera out there either, especially for the price."
5,Really easy to use,"The V3935 is my first digital camera ever, and I just got it in the mail today. After maybe 15-20 minutes of reading the manual, I knew basically all of the camera's features inside and out. The images are sharp, and the camera itself comes with tons of stuff (like free photo software!). The only thing is, it really does eat up AA's; the batteries that came with it are already dead! Guess I'll just have to buy rechargeables..."
4,I haven't had enough,"While song number (We've Had enough, the album version) isn't anything you cannot find on the normal CD, the two demo songs are great. ""Blue In The Face"" demo is really great and I must say it is toss up to which version I like better. This versions is much faster. I'd highly suggest buying this if you are a A3 follower. Don't waste your time with some of the other singles or imports. Be choosey with your purchases as some songs appear on other albums and it is just cheaper to buy the two albums than the one lone import. The A3 +2 song disc of Good Morning is a good pick though. PS Matt, Dan, and Derek if you read this PLEASE book a show in central PA. I promise to get you 100+ fans at least. We don't see or especially hear you."
4,So Cold...,"I must admit that Lycia takes home the award in the depressingmusic department. Who said depression couldn't be beautiful?Listening to this release makes me think of being alone in adark forest in the dead of winter. This sort of music was madeto either attract or repel listeners; in my case it accomplishes both jobs. It's far too cold and harsh to comfortme, but in a strange way it brings a sense of disturbed peaceto my mind. It is not an uplifting form of peace; it's moreof a feeling of angst followed by a relieved sense of isolation.[Yes, isolationism has positive qualities.] This CD reveals the dark side of the winter season. [SAD is a good comparison.]Christmas or Hannukah will never be the same again after youlisten to this industrial snowstorm. Your children will fear poor Father Christmas died traveling in it."
5,Charles Laughton will capture your heart.,"Charles Laughton is great as a street performer who is bedazzled by a young Vivien Leigh in this 1930's film about London buskers. Great if you want to capture a glimpse of London in the 1930's. A warm fuzzy feeling you'll get when seeing this film, and ""Charlie"" will capture your heart as a kind warm-hearted individual who sacrifices his personal gain for a young aspiring actress."
1,St. Martin's Lane/ Wings of the Morning,I was very disappointed in the DVD of these classic films. The color television in Wings of the Morning was not as in the original film and I found St. Martin's Lane very loud and boring. I didn't like having to bother with it to get to Wings of the Morning. I returned it to seller for credit as not with color TV as described on the cover.
4,Interesting historical document,"Aside from Ruth Underhill's work ethnology of the Papago (Tohono O'odham) is scant. This is by no means an anthropological work; it contains the memories of a bold woman living, trapping, working, on Papago land from the 30's to the 50's. As an anthropologist I was pleasantly surprised by many of the stories which included brief descriptions of the sagauro rain ceremonies and shamanic curing rituals. The overall portrait or mood of life in the desert is captured as well; not to mention the determination, strength and love of the Amish-raised Goldie, who established and ran a trading post at San Simon for many years. A fun engaging book of a culture in transition."
3,DAMAGE,"I ordered this book for a friend musician , who is very enthusiastic about the content .However ,it's a pity that the book arrived not in mint condition : small damage on the side and the cover was loose at the back .I tried to glue it to avoid all the mess of complaining and resending etcGreetingsWilly Van de VELDE"
3,Good for discussion; not a page-turner,"I read this for a book club. I have to admit that I'm not sure I see why it has received all this acclaim. There were pages that I just had to force myself to wade through. That being said, I can see for it's time that it was quite a thriller. The writing style is just so much different than what we as readers of most modern novels are accustomed to.I never felt any kind of sympathy for Emma Bovary, but yet I do believe she is representative of those individuals who are always looking outward to something or someone else to make them happy. Manners, customs, fashions, lifestyles have changed, but there are still plenty of Emma Bovarys today. Good literature lets us see human nature at its best or at its worst; this book does that.As the saying goes, ""So many books, so little time"" -- if you have lots of time, read this. However, if there's only so much time, there are many more modern novels that will be easier to read and relate to."
3,She insisted on being unhappy,This story really got me thinking. I couldn't decide whether to liked Madame Bovary or not.She married a man she neither loved nor respected. She was trapped and trying to make the best of it. On the other hand her husband loved her and would do anything for her but she used him badly. Was she feeling sorry for herself? Was she just a spoiled little brat who could not accept the hand life dealt her?I enjoyed this book but I finished it with a question mark.
1,godawful bore,"Dear lord this book was awful. One of the very few novels that I have been unable to finish, or indeed even get to half-way. It was just TOO BORING! Before throwing it in the charity bin I skimmed through the rest to see if something, anything, happened that I would be interested in. Nope. As for the much-praised language, maybe it was because I was reading the English translation but nothing about it struck me as being at all out of the ordinary. I've read and enormously enjoyed other novels from the 19th century (including the not dissimilar Anna Karenina) so I have to conclude that Flaubert is not for me. I see from other reviews that this is a high school text in some countries; had I had to read this dull, blowsy tripe for school I would have been tempted to drop out."
1,translation is everything,"Typically Penguin Classics does a great job with translating foriegn classics, but in the case of Madame Bovary, they do not. I read two chapters in this book and had to keep going back and re-reading sentences and had the most difficult time trying to figure out what was trying to be conveyed. Finally, I drove over to my local library and checked out the Bantam Classics version and I am extremely pleased that I did. It reads so much better and is actually entertaining. Get the book, but get Lowell Bair's translation."
1,Detested this book.,"I had to read this awful piece of classic lit in college:* You keep reading it hoping/waiting for it to get good. It never does.* I had similar feelings when I read Great Expectations. Never turns the corner.May have been shocking & scandalous when written, but it's long and drawn out now. Just a chore to read. My least favorite classic.It's the opposite of the Count of Monte Cristo, which is stellar.Classics that I enjoyed... recent author from Rutgers translation of Dante's Inferno. Sir Thomas Moore's Utopia. Animal Farm. Scarlett Letter. Lord of the Flies. Gulliver."
3,The Sherlock Holmes Collection (Staring Max Headroom),"The DVD arrived in good condition faster than anticipated.Concerning the program: Being a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I couldn't be disapointed. The actor who plays Holmes (aka Max Headroom) does a good English accent (he's American) though, if you watch a great deal of British programs, you'll be able to tell the difference, particullarily when he's excited. At points, the accent seems artifically affected."
1,Want some eggs with that ham?,"Dreadful! I couldn't watch it. I had to turn it off. The over-acting was painful to witness. I have seen dozens of different adaptations of the Sleuth of sleuths but this one was one NOT to watch. Granted, everyone involved tried really really hard -- too hard, in fact. The sets and costumes were bright and, uh, cheery. The actors were earnest and dedicated while chewing the scenery. But that's as much as can be said. Instead try ANY OTHER version of the tales of the great detective, up to and including the off-beat but comedic Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, the serviceable 1954 Ronald Howard television episodes, or the exceptionally well updated Sherlock seasons 1 & 2 with Benedict Cumberbatch from BBC."
2,buyer beware,"Some of the reviewers say that there are four movies in this set but there are only three, as advertised by amazon. The rare Sign of the Four is not in this set. Also the art work on the case that is advertised here is not what you get. The cover is a plain black with a silver silhouette of SH - very blah. Very disappointing."
5,Sherlock R O C K S,"sherlock holmes is one of the greatest characters ever created in all of literature, to have this character brought to life is just awsome. i recommend this collection very highly"
3,Not the best--but ok,"These storys are apparently put out by Hallmark. The filming is fine and provides a nice atmosphere and the performance by Kenneth Welsh as Dr. Watson is exceptional--however, the same cannot be said for Matt Frewer as Holmes. While his performance is better than Ronald Howard--it is no where near the standards of Basil Rathbone or my favorite Holmes-Jeremy Brett. These stories are still worth watching-and a good value! The strange division of ""The Royal Scandal""-has no rational explanation--as this is a 2 disc set--with about 210 minutes on disc 1 and 150 minutes on disc 2--why it wasn't neatly divided ito 2 complete storys per disc is beyond me. While a minor complaint--I feel it's a valid complaint. Providing one does not expect a Brett/Rathbone performance from Frewer--these discs can be enjoyed--and Welsh is fantastic as Watson."
4,Good parts are very good but...,"Certainly an amusing and intriguing plot and character development. I'm no prude, but there was a bit more ""poking"" and vulgar language than necessary, but I can live with that.I'd give it five stars except for the fact that the Hoppy character was so completely spineless and unprotective of his girlfriend, that it was quite annoying to me. I kept shouting to myself, ""Hoppy, kick that stupid slut out, and punch her other boyfriend in the snoot,"" but he never did.I certain did enjoy this otherwise."
4,Great workout,"This is a great workout with a lot of tips to use. What I don't like is that her smile is very fake, her voice is weird and she doesn't cover posture, which extremely important."
