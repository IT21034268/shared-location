2,disappointed,"The light didn't work for me. I have no way of knowing if the design of this lamp was actually at fault, but judging from the results, the light therapy did more harm than good. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone with a diagnosed mood disorder."
1,Faulty,I have just started using this item. I contacted the Canadain/American company for info on the product and they assured me it would come ready to use and without bulbs. I purchased it and bulbs and it arrived with bulbs. However after having to buy an adaptor and being assured that I could use it without a transformer all 3 bulbs have now blown in the first 2 days of usage and I now have to discover who I contact to answer my problems. Any suggestions?
1,Didn't work for me,"I thought this would be the ideal solution to our long gloomy Michigan winters, especially after reading all the excellent reviews. My husband went through the manual and set the lamp up. The first day I tried it, I got a headache after 15 minutes. The second day I tried it, I put it in a different position and got the headache and a burning sensation in my eyes (which unfortunately lasted all day). I then read the manual and found the sentence ""do not use if you have a mood disorder and are on medication"" which I am. So the lamp was returned. I notice now that Amazon has a disclaimer on its products, but what good is that? That just means a lot more returns and inconveniences. I would think something important as not using with a mood disorder would be in the listing. I do appreciate Amazon for their return policy and good prices. I will continue to be one of their permanent customers."
1,Faulty,"Purchased it for my wife as a Christmas gift and didn't want to open it before I gave it to her as it was all wrapped up very neatly. Now I wish I had. She opened it, I assembled it, went to turn it on and the lamps wouldn't light as they're faulty. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT! Last time I'll purchase something this expensive online.I called the distributor and, fortunately, they sent me (in PDF format) UPS shipping forms to attach to package to send back item to the company to have my account reimbursed."
4,"Not getting 5 stars since I don't know if it really works, but...","...it's a solid SAD lamp. Well-made, bright and the adjustable legs are great for positioning the lamp above your computer monitor. I'm still skeptical of light therapy (hence the 4 stars), but I think that this is a good investment if you tend to suffer from SAD, winter blues, etc."
4,Very Bright Light,Seems to be working fine now. I purchased for another member of the family. I gave it four stars instead of five because one of the tubes was loose when it arrived. I took all the screws out to open the back to check whether a tube was bad or just loose. Another reviewer had had the same problem. It seems to be much more stable without the legs included in the box. Otherwise all seems to be well.
5,Uplift Technologies DL930,"This has helped to give me more energy, ease depression from the death of my brother and a father with Alzheimer's Disease, and it has helped to regulate my circadian rhythms so I am sleeping better. I read about light therapy in the book, ""The Depression Cure."" It has restored a big piece of the missing link in helping to solve my insomnia and depression naturally. I recommend the book and this product if you are suffering from similar symptoms."
4,I thought only greeting cards could brighten your day . . .,"Sure, I was skeptical when I first heard about this product but at the urging of a close friend I treated myself last Christmas. Lack of sunshine has always caused me to feel down. Now a simple 30 minutes a day has changed my entire outlook. Tried it at home and yes, the legs were to flimsy for people with kids. When I ever mounted on the wall in my office I was able to enjoy the full benefits.I work at a greeting card company (iZon Greetings) and depression of any kind can make for horrible greeting cards. Now with my day.light all my iZon greeting cards make people smile.Oh, and being in the printing in graphics field this light is a handy tool instead of bulky light tables."
2,DIDN'T SEE A DIFFERENCE,"I bought this light because I suffer from insomnia/depression and sleep distrbances. I also am tired all the time and my sleep clock is so late that I am sleeping during the day and up most the night. The light is very easily put together and does not smell like some reviews indicated. It is a bright white light which is easy to work by.It does seem to help me wake up better as the bright light is, well, eye opening.The bad news is that it has not impacted my sleep at all. Nor has it made me sleepier any earlier in the evening. I have not gotten any extra energy either.The other observation that I've made is that any bright light would probably give the same effect. There are 3 uv lights under this panel and from what I understand, there is nothing pharmecudical or different about them than any other bright light."
3,Day-Light,"The physical quality of the product is resonably good. The stand is a bit spindly--a little more heft to the legs of the thing would be nice to make it a bit sturdier. The light is strong and really lights up the area covered.However, the actual effectiveness of the product is questionable. This was recommended by our doctor and it doesn't seem to have made a significant impact on my wife's condition. It's a lot to pay for a treatement that doesn't seem to be working."
5,Great lamp,"After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase this lamp over several other options, and I'm really glad I did. It was easy to set up, and the instructions for how to reduce SAD were simple, easy to understand, and effective. The first couple times I looked at the product online, I did not realize that it was a tabletop lamp, since it has legs - but it's the perfect size. I have it on my desk at work, and try to use it for a little bit every day. Time will tell how well it works, but so far it definitely seems to have an impact on my mood."
3,"Decent product, odd design","I'll leave the evaluations of this lamp's validity as a medical tool to the psychiatrists, and will only speak to its design. Unlike other users, I have not detected an unpleasant smell with use. I like that the lamp has a regular setting and a ""therapeutic"" setting. The design and setup leave something to be desired. The instructions state that you must open the lamp and remove the plastic brace from the base of each bulb before use. Those suckers really don't want to come out. I had to alternate between tweezers and pliers to remove those little bits of plastic! My other complaint is that the legs are too spindly. They do not provide a stable base for the somewhat heavy lamp body. It wobbles a lot. The large screws that hold the lamp at an angle unscrew very easily. This is annoying, because the instructions make it clear that the angle of light is important.For the price I would expect a considerably more solid design."
4,You are my sunshine,"This light has helped get my day started with brilliance. This week when the time changed, I really appreciate the light in the morning.The unit fits nicely over the monitor on my desk. I no longer feel so guilty sitting at my desk for a half hour checking email when I get up when there are other things I need to do. It has become an essential part of my routine.I understand Uplift has another model that switches to a lower light level to use as a task light during the rest of the day. I would consider getting that if I had known."
4,"Good gift, tested fine.",Gave this to our son. We had time to test for two weeks before our son arrived and we gave it to him. We are all satisfied with this fine product.
1,Increase your SAD ness,"I Ordered this Full Spectrum Day-Light DL-930 on Oct 4 and with the usual speediness of Amazon, it was delivered on Oct 11. But it arrived with a broken light bulb.Now these bulbs are not found in Home Depot or any of my local stores, and Amazon referred me back to the manufacturer for a replacement bulb. I have called twice, and emailed them twice. Although they assured me that the bulb will be sent, it is now November and I still have no sign of the replacement bulb. The days are shorter and darker, the aggravation from dealing with this company is irritating, and I still do not have the use of this claimed ""wonder product""."
3,Excellent Product! Really worked for me.,This light has worked wonders for me in addition to increase in meds. The light kicked in before the meds and really made a difference with my SAD. But you have to use it every day. The only problem is the legs. They are not stable! I does work without the legs. It can be mounted on the wall and it can sit up alone.
2,Bad design,"Dear Uplift,Redesign the screws so they aren't embedded so deeply and can be accessed without a half hour or more of wrenching and cursing. Also, the elastics and rubber shims for shipping safety inside the light are the source of the disgusting smell that drives people to return this product. You do not make it plains no clear in the manual that one MUST REMOVE THIS STUFF BEFORE TURNING THE LIGHT ON FOR THE FIRST TIME. Seriously, put a sticker on the front of the light that directs people to unscrew and remove inside packing before use. Bejeezus!I won't go into how cheap and wobbly the legs are here because that's well covered by other reviewers.I will say that the chintzy design of your lamp (made in China of course) is wide open for competition to come along with a better product to blow this out of the water"
3,"Fine, but didn't live up to the hype","For me, this lamp was not enough to reduce the stress of winter or not going out in the daytime much. It's also kind of ugly and awkward and not something you want to leave out all the time, and kind of inconvenient for the exact placement of it near your face. It was probably better than nothing and it did provide a nice light to work at.As a side note, what I did find beneficial for reducing stress hormones, improving mood and energy, etc.:My husband made me a much more intense day-light substitute using 5 150 watt bulbs and 5 200 watt bulbs to stand in front of, full body, for not more than a few minutes 2-3 times per day and I find that actually works amazingly well, unlike this SAD day-light desk lamp. So, the concept of bright artificial light certainly works, and maybe some people just require more than others."
3,Cheaply Made But May Actually Work,"I have had the light for about 3 weeks now, I use from 8:30am to 9:30am every morning. My mood has def. lifted though with so many variables in my life at the moment, it's hard to tell what exactly is responsible for the change.The light is of mediocre quality. I would be surprised if it cost more than $15 to actually build wherever it is manufactured. The stand is haliriously bad and the industrial design is bad to say the least. There is a slight smell of plastic when the light is on, but it's not overwhelming.Overall, it's expensive for what it is, but compared to other products in its category, it's a decent buy serving function over form."
4,Pretty sure it's not a placebo effect,"The only thing that I've found a little difficult was to sit in the recommended position with your head looking forward, 12 inches away. It feels a bit ""formal"" and is not the way I typically sit. Anyway, I've had more energy in the mornings with the light, but I've also been drinking my coffee earlier as a result. It has a calming effect on it...overall, I'm not totally sure what its doing. I feel good about it though."
4,Uplift DL 930,Legs are a bit flimsy. Otherwise it is good quality. Notable smell when operating is a bit irritating. Good price for a SAD lamp.
5,SAD LAMP,"I recently moved to Alaska and immediantly found a need for a good SAD lamp.The winter nights here are endless. I started searching for SAD lamps and found the DL930 on Amazon.com to be one of the best rated and at a great deal. I was able to get both $30.00 off the price and free shipping! I found the assemble instructions easy and everything was intact upon arrival. I use the lamp every morning. I have seen a profound difference in both my energy level and sleep patterns. The light is easy to use (can be placed above you while reading, the legs can be removed for easy transport and placed on a desk top or counter, or it can be hung up) The lighting is a soft but very bright lighting similar to a Spring or Summer day and the lamp does not get hot unlike others I have used. I am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others...you won't be disappointed!"
4,SAD lamp,"Seems to be helping my husband. A little early to tell. The description speaks of the stand legs and legs on the back. I was very disappointed that upon reading the instructions, the small legs on the back were not to be used if the lamp was used for SAD treatment. The lamp, in it's working form takes up a lot of space!"
3,"Haven't noticed any effects, but product is good quality","I use this product for 20 minutes each morning. It is very easy to use and is sturdy - good quality. I haven't noticed any improved energy or happiness, and I am even concerned that it might be the cause of some recent headaches and restless sleep; but I will keep using it and am hoping that I will see some benefits in the future."
2,Warning: Device emits toxic odor,"The device itself produces good illumination but emits a strong toxic odor/fumes. I would only recommend using this device in well ventilated areas such as an open garage or porch area. Otherwise, repeated exposure to odor is a health hazard in my opinion."
4,poor packaging,"When I received my light it was VERY POORLY PACKAGED. The box was over sized & there was only a small amount of paper packing material in it, which allowed it to bounce around!! I would certainly review your packing dept., to prevent any other products to leave your warehouse like this. Luckily the light doesn't appear to be damaged & is working well. I am very happy with the results. Thank-you, Linda"
3,Bright but awkward,"I definitely noticed an improvement in my mood and energy levels. In fact, the first time I used it I couldn't bear to turn it off it felt so good, and ended up with mild sunburn, highlights in my hair, and a case of extreme hyperactivity.However, it is enormous and bright enough to allow small children to play soccer at night! I ended up bringing it home from work because it lit up the office like someone was filming movies. It is so large that it doesn't store well in my smaller home between sessions. I am currently online looking for a portable travel model recommended by a friend."
4,This is a quality light for the money!,"After trying the SAD light for varying degrees of time and at different amounts of lux, I still could not shake the side effects. My eyes hurt, I had a headache, stomach ache, and the jitters. I bought it for my manic depression that was worse seasonally, but definately due to bi-polar disorder. And, I had read there is a risk of the SAD therapy causing mania in those folks who struggle with bi-polar disorder. I decided I would give it a try.I have returned the light- though I am very impressed with the quality of the light itself and my purchase and experience buying from Amazon. I would definately recommend both to others who struggle with SAD!!! Great value so it seems!"
4,Review of the SAD Lamp,"The lamp does a great job of putting off the amount of light needed for the SAD light therapy, is angle & height adjustable, & works fantasticly as a desk lamp at the lower lux. The only negative whatsoever, would be the size of the device & trying to stay the appropriate distance from the device throughout the therapy...there is a tendancy to move in or out of the proper range, but this has not been a problem & the results have been wonderful!"
5,It really works for me!,"I bought this light after reading Stephen Hardi's The Cure for Depression. I shopped around on Amazon to see what kind of lights are available. I considered the newer, ""blue light"" technology, but as Hardi points out, that technology hasn't been around long enough to have 20 years of proven success studies behind it. So I went with the tried and true.This lamp has been a big success for me. I used to have a lot of trouble getting out of bed in the morning. Even though this is already the brighter time of the year, I have found that it has made an amazing difference. It has regulated my sleeping pattern, and I feel much better.I had no trouble with odor, as mentioned in other reviews.I highly recommend this for anyone who is dealing with depression, whether or not it has anything to do with the seasons of the year!"
5,AWESOME help for SAD,"I never thought a ""light"" could do much more than help you to see. Boy Oh Boy! Was I wrong. I've been using this light for a week now and already I notice changes. I have a little more energy in the morning. I feel better. I look forward to sitting under it for my 30 min session. It has two settings. I use the brighter setting. Also, there were some comments about a smell? Since I have taken it out of the box and used it I have not noticed any odor, ever. It is tall enough to fit over things on my desk. It is large, but for what it accomplishes it's so worth it. WELL worth the money to lift me out of feeling horrible."
4,"Very good ""new traditionalist"" material","Rodney Crowell came out of the New Traditionalist country movement of the late 70s and early 80s and was, along with Randy Travis, one of the artists most faithful to traditional country. This collection is not a career retrospective as it just focuses on the period during which he recorded with Columbia but it was clearly a fertile period. Not all of the songs are equally great here but there isn't a weak song in the bunch. There's a couple of ballads (""After All This Time"" and ""Things I Wish I'd Said"") that are among the most moving country songs you'll ever hear - without being maudlin, which is a big plus for country ballads. Among the more upbeat tracks, the two that kick off the CD (""Lovin' All Night"" and ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"") are terrific.This collection is a bit thin at 12 tracks but then I'd rather have a tight collection of 12 excellent cuts than a 20 track CD padded with a number of mediocre songs."
1,bad cd,Upon recieving this cd...of which the only song I wanted was what kind of love... has 4 to 5 major skips in it.. I would like my money back...I dont think amazon would want people to sell bad c d's on their site
4,Fire in the City,Overall goodI was hoping that there would be more on the content of the sermons of Savonarola
4,a must-have book for all English learners,"When I first knew of the existence of this book, I wondered: why, there should be such a dictionary in every language! And, yet, how come I didn't even once think of searching for that kind of dictionary in English?? I should have known of it much earlier!English is my second language, and even though I belong to the cateogry of ""advanced"" learner, I still have difficulty, for instance, in locating the right preposition or adverb that go with certain verbs or adjectives. For example, the very subtle difference in meaning between ""be familiar to vs. be familar with"" is a very difficult one for a non-native English speaker like me to grasp. The BBI dictionary of English Word Combinations aims to address problems unique to ESL learners, including the one I just mentioned. Keep it handy, and it will let you command more accurate & ""real"" English."
4,Cork Backed. Good Ruler,"Not much to be said on a ruler. It is cork backed and works as a ruler should. Numerical indications start 1/8"" fro the actual ruler ends."
3,"24"" Stainless Steel Ruler/ Straight edge","This item is as good as any manufacturers like product. Very fast shipping and packaged well. Nothing else to say except the item is as expected in every way, as it should be."
2,Flimsy for the size and price,"Needed something this size for trimming out Graphic Design proofs and mock-ups, but this thing is just too flimsy to use more than a few inches at a time. I will definitely buy something else to replace."
5,This tape is outstanding!,Babbie Mason is an anointed singer who is greatly used of God on this tape. I would strongly recommend that this CD be added to you collection for present and future enjoyment!
3,Small,"Everything seems fine with it, neon light,good,nice keypad,buttons ; except that is too small , the right stick gets in the way when i'm pushing the buttons and sticks are hard to press R3, and last, the relocations of L2 and R2 just make it worse."
1,Fried the PS2 after 2 days!!,"DO NOT - DO NOT - DO NOT get this controller! I got it for my nephew for his birthday thinking that he would love the neon colors and such - he did, but after two days the PS2 crashed!The packaging for this item even says ""If Pelican's Afterglow PRO causes damage to your PS2 console through normal operation, Peliocan will repair or replace your system at no charge."" He got it on Fri. the 30th, played for a couple hours, and then on New Years Eve, the PS2 crashed! It will not read ANY discs, new or old, tried changing out the controllers, etc., the TV screen when the PS2 is on now reads ""Disc read error!""Now we have to see if the company is really true to thier word and see if they will fix/replace the console.Definanlty was not worth the hassle to get this and I am sure the fixing of the PS2 will definantly make it not worth buying this item."
4,Big Play Ray,This is an excellent cd for those who know Christ. This cd is entertaining and inspiring.
3,Grapetree quality.,"I guess I didn't expect too much from this first album by Mr. Buchanan, and I'll be honest, my expectations were pretty much right on.Lyrically he is right up front about Jesus and changing your life and becoming saved by the blood, and if you're looking to buy the album for that reason, then by all means, please don't worry about diving head-first into this venture. But I feel that on the the musical side, it just flat out didn't deliver much to be remembered. A few guest appearances by Blake Knight salvaged the CD and brought the album to a level of acceptibility, so I guess if you're a BK or Ill Harmonics fan u may want to grab a listen to this album as well.Overall, I guess this album supports the stereotype that athletes don't make very good rappers :) However, taking into consideration that Mr. Buchanan is a Christian, and that his aim is to spread the gospel of Jesus to the people, that alone is cause to support this release."
1,U suck RAY!!!!!,"how in the hell did i end up with this album? o yea i found it in a gutter sumwhere, i curse the day i picked this thing up and have since thrown it away. ray u r worse at rapping then u r at footabll...... i love jesus but this is AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Try it like this...,"At first, I found Ray's album difficult to groove to. Then I tried listening to it backwards, while shooting steroids with hookers, and it all made sense."
4,Disco Infernal,"As compilation albums go, some soundtracks are hit and miss--others strike so close to the bullseye, it's frustrating when they're off by a small margin.My pet gripe in this case? Replacing Joe Cocker's version of 'You Are So Beautiful' with Billy Preston.Aside from that, what you've got is a virtual A1 collection of top disco classics, including 'Rock the Boat' and my favourite on the album, 'Lady Marmalade'. Particularly impressive since hearing the vocals...of Pink, Christina, et al and their cover version which is beyond 3rd rate."
4,Ballet Scene Music,"A great version of the music from the scene where Carlito watches Gail dance is Dome Epais (Flower Duet) by Ingrid Kertesi, Monika Krause & Roberto Servile."
5,Beautiful lapis!,"Lapis lazuli is a beautiful stone that has been mined by man since prehistoric times. Indeed, in ancient Mesopotamia, it was considered the queen of gemstones, and was highly sought after for jewelry. Now is your opportunity to own a piece of lapis jewelry for yourself!This handsome ring is made of numerous lapis chips, strung along an elastic string. Its beautiful blue color looks excellent with formal, semi-formal, and even informal outfits. Plus, the less you are wearing, the more important jewelry is, and this bracelet always looks great. I love this bracelet, and highly recommend it!(Review of Genuine Denim Lapis Chip Stretch Ring)"
4,Rowdy and Ready,"Man...this cd rocks!!! if your sitting down, you'll get up and move...if your driving...watch the speedlimit cause you'll automatically start going faster...the best country/punk band around. These guys bring back old school country music at a fast and furious pace...think, Ramones meets Haggard or maybe Hank Sr. The pedal steel of Greg and Timbo's rough and ready vocals set the pace and the rest of the band have no problems keeping up. Run!, don't walk to the checkout counter below with this CD...you'll thank me for it...but thats not needed...just send money!Rich"
2,Easy?,"This book completely oversimplifies almost every aspect of brokering frieght. It has a few good tips, that's about it."
1,DICK AND JANE,"I purchased this book because I am interested in starting my own Freight Brokerage Business. In order to start your own brokerage company you ""must"" already know how to broker freight. What I am looking for is detailed information about where to start and everything that is needed to startup. This book just gives a ""very simple"" explanation about how you broker freight. This was a total waste of my money!!!! I have been in the trucking business for 21 yrs and have brokered freight for about 8 years so I already know in general what needs to be done. I need a book that is much much more informative about HOW TO START A FREIGHT BROKERAGE!!!"
2,Somewhat Useful...could use more general info,overall not bad....but a person trying to start their own biz will need more info than found in this book.
2,Broker Review,This book is an elementary review of freight brokering. It resembles a pamplet and I do not recommend it to anyone.
2,Very Limited Information,"I am working with someone who is already familiar with this business. We just wanted more information on starting one of our own. This book has very little information for the more important components, like the cost of licenses or anything specific for that matter. Palo Alto Software will sell you the same book (perhaps a slight different version) in eBook form but for [...] dollars and are not upfront about their book being the Entrepreneur book. Do yourself a favor, find a better source for your startup. I should also mention a chunk of the book is available for FREE at [...] site."
3,not that great,"Good for someone how is starting their own business, if you deal with your own company, is more of what already you do."
1,cheap,"I too was attracted to the flexibility of this enclosure: ATA and SATA inside, USB2, FW400, SATA outside. Turns out its pretty cheap, the case itself is not designed to be taken apart and reassembled, the connectors are pretty weak and you can not use more than one at a time via Firewire. That was the show stopper for me. USB mode was also pretty slow and it has no fan so it gets HOT, which is bad for your drives. Pass this one over and get a enclosure for your specific needs or expect to spend more money for good quality."
1,Dead on Arrival!,"I have to confess that I didn't purchase this item through Amazon, but through a local electronics megastore (F*y's). I was drawn to purchase this unit because of the flexibility of connecting via SATA, USB2.0 or firewire, and the unit handling both IDE and SATA drives.However, after connecting everything up, I tried to power up the unit and NOTHING! You think they'd at least check to make sure these units turned on before they ship them. I don't know whether the problem is in the AC cord or the power adapter, but this unit is as lifeless as a brick. Not too surprised in retrospect - unlike my MacAlly PHR-100AC unit, this unit does not have a fully grounded power supply. (I always like to see grounded AC power for my computer equipment...)"
5,Wonderful book.,Another wonderful story about three mature ladies and their experiences in the small town of Covington.
2,A Rather tired story,"After really enjoying the first 3 books in this series I began to find it to be rather formulaic. And the characters have begun to be annoying rather than charming. Amelia is self centered, Hannah is rigid, and Grace has no spine at all. I found myself being irritated by them instead of curious."
5,Time Heals All Things,"I enjoyed this book in the Covington series. It started out rather dramatically with a fire that quickly spread in the cove.The fire destroys the farmhouse, the ladies of Covington are devastated. Slowly they begin the process of rebuilding.Many developments in this story prove interesting. Hannah's daughter develops a relationship with Hank and they are going to have a baby. Hannah and Max become very close and decide to marry.Like the other books in this series, this one deals with many family issues in a beautiful setting of the Appalachian mountains."
4,The ladies,Great read. I just love the ladies. Hannah makes a wise decision. I want t o live out my last 20 maybe 30 years like these ladies.
1,BROKEN STEIN,"The seller did not package/wrap/protect this stein for shipping and therefore when I received it, the unopened box sounded like it had a million loose pieces in it. I returned it to the seller and Amazon refunded my money."
5,Shifter boot review,The boot was everything as expected but the supplied sheet metal screws were a little on the cheap side. I'd get better ones next time.
5,THE SEVENTIES NEVER SOUNDED SO GOOD!,"So like I searched for this CD, everywhere, for maybe 5 years. Don't ask me why it didn't occur to me sooner to look on amazon.com. The CD is an amazing blend of Brazilian melody, Afro/Cuban funk,and pop influences with a just a hint of jazz. Musical contributors such as Stevie Wonder, Mike Sembello (""She's a Maniac"")and, of course, Sergio Mendes, as well as the mellifluous harmmonies and musicianship of ""the New Brasil'77"", make this a must have for any ""Sergio""phile."
3,Looks useful,Looks useful but I did not use it in my class. The information in the book can come in handy someday.
5,A Double Scoop of Entertainment...,"If you love mysteries, you owe it to yourself to buy this book. If you love daytime drama, you owe it to yourself to buy this book. If you love mysteries AND daytime drama, and you buy this book, you've bought yourself a ticket to entertainment heaven. Linda not only weaves a fascinating story with characters that jump off the page and dive straight into your imagination, she does it with the humor and spice that only an insider could deliver. When I reluctantly came to the last page, my one consolation was that another entry in the series is on its way in May 2005. ""All My Children"" and ""One Life to Live"" creator Agnes Nixon has been quoted that the key to successful daytime drama is to ""Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry, make 'em wait."" I've laughed, I've cried, I'm WAITING..."
3,no samples!,how should we order this cd and we don't even know what it contains? I need a sample to rate this cd my self..can you please put some samples to hear?or can any one send me one of these tracks please? my e-mail is:gengar@arabclan.com
3,"Weak, but I couldnt put it down!","""The House"" was the first Bentley Little book I have read but it wont be the last. Although I was disappointed in the ending of the book it was a good read. Hopefully the next one I read will be better."
5,Brilliant!,"Is there anything Bentley Little CAN'T do? He took on serial killers in DEATH INSTINCT, vampires in THE SUMMONING, religion in THE REVELATION and DOMINION, conformity in THE IGNORED and corporate America in THE STORE, and he brought something new to each. Now in THE HOUSE, he combines Koontz's STRANGERS with a haunted house tale and comes up with a story that's completely unique. Original and terrifying, THE HOUSE is the best horror novel I've read so far this year."
3,"Off to a good start, but...","therein lies the problem: the prologue was some of the most intriguing horror fiction I think I've ever read. Even the first half of the book was great. But then we actually get all the characters to the house and the story just literally falls apart. No plot, rhyme, reason, or even a satisfactory ending. Will I keep reading Bentley Little? Absolutely (seeing as I bought The Walking and the Town at the same time). Word of caution: everything you read in the other reviews about the sexual depravity of this novel is true."
3,Some good twists but....,"This is the first book I've read by Little. As I said above, The House has some very good plot twists, but I had a hard time reading this. For me, the biggest problem is that this book was very repetitive. Once you read about what one character goes through, then we have to read about 3 other characters that have to go through the samething. It was just hard for me to get through.That being said, this book does has things to offer. I found myself glued to what happened to a character the first time I read what was happening. When it comes to decription, Little is wonderful. The secnes of horror were so detailed, it gave me the shivers.The plot of the book is simple....and yet complex. Some adults have to go back to their childhood house and face their worse fears.This was my first book, and even though I gave it only 3 stars, I plan to read more of Little."
4,Great book,"The only thing bad about this book is the little girl as a sex object. I know she was really a demon in the form of a little girl, but I still think Bentley Little just hid behind that, as an excuse to shock people with suggestions of child porn (not as bad as an book I once read called beast house). If Mr. Little had made the demon an adult, I would have given it five stars."
2,Nasty is right,"I chose this book as part of a reading assignment for my writing class. I wanted a good ghost story (which, honestly, I can find very few). Even so, when I set out to read a book, I always read all the way through expecting ""the payoff"" (sometimes it takes a little longer than other books). It just never came. In fact, I had more questions on finishing the story than I'd had beginning it. I also found the sexual scenes very offensive. I thought that carrying through to the end would give some insight as to why this child (demon, thing) was the way she was. For what reason was she trying to entice these people, men and women (I'd even understand it if, for instance, one of the characters did have the inclination to molest children -- sort of a downfall through temptation thing). It didn't make sense to make it such a dominant part of the story or so graphically written. I wanted a horror novel not kiddie porn."
1,One of the WORST books i have ever read,"I've read several Bentley Little books although why, i'm not sure. I can't say for sure if this one or the one about the postman was worse, but either way, i have given up reading anything he writes. If i could rate this book with less than one star, i would. I picture the first seventy-five percent of this book written at his leisure, with very little interest other than for the money he would make when it got published. The last twenty-five percent of the book, the finale, seemed rushed and contrived, written in a flash because his dead line was quickly approaching. If a writer is going to write, he should have the decency to at least try his best. And if a publisher is going to publish, he should have enough respect not to insult readers with this kind of garbage."
1,This book is perverse filth with no redeeming qualities.,"Little has no talent whatsoever, or if he does, he consciously determined NOT to use it and, instead, to use the blunt sledgehammer of detailed, explicit, repetitive and in-your-face pedophilia and other abominations to convice you that the bad guys are, indeed, bad. (Of course, the good guys do this stuff too, so maybe Little is just an extremely sick person who wants to infect his readers with his peculiar brand of deviancy.) This book would have been far better if Little could have accepted his limitations and not tried to use gratuitous filth to cover for his shallow character development and contrived plot. Stay away from this book and this author. Life is too short to be wasted on this."
4,Oblique and entertaining,I purchased this book despite its sophomoric cover art and was pleased that I had. Its a bit surrealistic and familliar with a bit of shock tossed in for good measure.
4,Very intense book but the ending was a let down! :(,"I picked up ""The House"" at a flea market on July 4th weekend. Being a HUGE fan of Stephen King, Dean Koontz and John Saul, I figured I would give Bentley Little a try (never had heard of him before).And I was really glad that I did! I read that book in record time! :) But, I have to say, that when the ending came, I felt total disappointment!! Like many others have said, it was like he ran out of steam when the ending came!I'm not saying that I won't read his other books because I plan to! One bad ending doesn't mean all of them will be that bad.....I'm still a 'new' fan! :) Glad we were introduced! :)"
4,More Bentley Please...,"While this isn't as good as The Mailman (still my favorite Little tale, this is very good. No, it is not the most terrifying book ever, but Bentley is such a great writer that it's just nice to read his words. It will give the creeps at times, but this is a book that could have easily been 100-200 pages longer, more scares and more about or heroes pasts. But, all in all a very well done book. Can't wait for more!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time !!,"It starts off pretty nicely. Then gets completely ridiculous !!! I can't believe I paid full price for this !! Such a horrible book !!! ugh It makes me sick to think I read the entire thing !!!!!!! The ending was so bad !!! They should've just kept the first couple of chapters, and left it unfinished. Then maybe it would've had a chance."
1,Worse horror (?) story I ever read,"The book started very powerfully, but the second half is completely ridiculus - so ridiculus it's almost funny. If Mr. Little got so bored writing it that he decided to wrap it up, imagine how you'll feel."
4,"Good first half, Boring second half.","I'm a big fan of Bentley Little and have not been disappointed by any of his books. The first half of the book is great, describing each of the characters situations. The second half however is not as great and got boring very quickly. I did not enjoy The House as much as the other books but it did make me love Bentley Little any less."
1,Maybe I Don't Get It,"I bought this book based on the reviews I read here. However, I was very disappointed with this book. I was expected a ""haunted house"" element to be present. There was none, just a very jumbled plot line. I was sorry I purchased this book."
1,Twisted,"After reading three other Bentley Little books I thought I could stand a little more of his odd type of horror. Well, I was totally unprepared for The House. It was so graphically gruesome I am suprised I was able to finish. There were some parts where nothing made sense and then there were parts where you could not help but understand even if you didnt want too. More sick than scary. Not written for those with weak stomachs in my opinion."
3,Not very good,"This is the only book by Bentley Little which is in myPublic Library and I can understand why. I have read this and The Store and since I thought the Store was so good, I couldn't wait to get the rest of his books. If The House was the only one the Librarian read, I don't blame him for not wasting his budget on any others. Somebody out there tell me what the first few chapters were supposed to do. I thought the man living in the airport was fascinating and worthy of more, but none of them ever surfaced again so excuse me, what was their point? Why kill one of the nicest people? I could not write a book, but I would not want a character as unlikeable as that horrid little girl who kept cropping up in everybody's world. I have spent a bunch of money at Amazon.Com on other Little books. I hope I haven't thrown my money to the winds. PS, to Amazon.Com: One of your reviews for The House was not for this book."
3,"A ""So-So"" read.....","This is the first B. Little book I have read and I felt it to be a bit dry. Really did not hold my attention very well and the flip-flopping between characters was sometimes confusing. And for being a ""horror"" type book it never once put me ""on edge""."
3,My first book read by this author...,"did lead me to read more of his books.The book has 5 main characters, one I liked, one I hated (because I am a teacher I guess) and the rest that were just kind of there.There were parts to it that did keep my attention (the paper doll the boy kept making, the character meeting his dead mother), and there were parts that I couldn't wait to get past (Doreen).The book reads fast, but it can be a bit confusing since it has five different characters and five different background stories converging together. To keep from constantly having to look back at previous chapters, I kept short character notes. This seemed to help."
3,fair,"""The House"" started off good, but fizzled.Part One was good, Part Two was too drawn out. I found myself rushing to get to the end.Also, what did the Prologue have to do with the rest of the story?Not one of my favorites from Bentley Little."
2,Story Reader Stopped Reading,"My 4 year old daughter absolutely loved this. She got it for Christmas and 6 months later it stopped working. She's disappointed and I'm annoyed having invested a lot in the books. She has more than a dozen and they are not cheap. Now, I need to spend another $30 to replace this thing. It's troublesome. I give it high marks for making the kids happy but not so great marks for poor technology that breaks fairly easily. Too bad."
1,DO NOT BUY!! SO HARD TO FIND WORKING BOOKS.,"I loved the idea of this toy as well-but it truly does not work with most of the books out there. It works with the two books it came with-I even went so far as to return my Story Reader and get a new one thinking it was defective. It was not-the magnets on the book do not work. I have bought two separate three packs brand new from two stores-neither have any books that work. They short out because the Story Reader can not read the magnet. Occasionally I can get them to read a sentence but they are all unusable. I have so many friends that have the same problem. I am stuck with useless books that do not work and a Story Reader that I can use only the two original books with. It is a good idea in theory, but it really does not work. Please DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Not great quality,I bought this and was surprised how cheap the construction was. It would not even turn on. I tried batteries and an AC adapter. I bought a couple other books and they did not work either. For the money you are better off buying the competition that will last a lot longer.
1,"Big promises, few rewards.",This toy is great- when it works!!! My daughter received this reader and seven books for Christmas. Only two of her seven books worked!!! Because they were purchased in another state and not available in my area simply returning them to the store is not possible. I called Publications Int. hoping they could help me exchange the books and got a blunt NO! Their warranty does not cover the books or cartridges in any way. I'm now stuck with about $50 worth of books that don't work in the reader. What a rip off!!! Don't buy this product. The odds are not in your favor!
4,Great toy!!,"My daughter is 4 and she LOVES this toy! She keeps it in the car and it reads to her every where we go! I would rather have her doing this than watching a movie! It obviously shouldn't replace YOU reading to your child, but it's a great addition!My only complaint is that it is very hard to find new books for it!"
4,storybook reader,"We got this for our 2 year old granddaughter who also has a leap pad. She prefers this one, and the stories, and it is so easy for her to use. We also got the mirophone, and she can sing with the songs. I do have trouble getting all the books that are available. That's why I got on this site. I think the people who wrote bad things about it aren't careful enough inserting it. I sure don't have any problem, nor does she. They do get bent, sometimes, but can be snapped in anyway. She loves it, and ""reads"" non stop when she is here. So easy!! Leapfrog needs too much button pushing and adjusting. I just wish I could find all the books! She has about 10. We also lost one of the cartridges, and wish I could get just that replacement."
1,Got it for a Christmas Gift,"I bought it through AVON to give to my Son at Christmastime, and If I would of known how the books sit in the reader thing I would of returned it back to them. I don't like it. Its an ok thing if i were to take the book in place. It gets moved when my son turns the pages. I am really disapointed in this. It takes 4 AAA batteries. The volume get's loud. Hard the turn it down if you don't have any nails on your fingers"
1,THIS TOY DOES NOT WORK,"I don't usually review toys, but I had to review this one. Do not buy this toy. What a disappointment! The two books that came with it worked fine. The 4 others that I bought do not work at all. I returned it."
1,How some major malfunctions! doesn't work!,"I agree with the poor reviews. it rarely works! bought two of them thinking the first was defective. our ""2nd"" one stopped working after one day! I think it ought to be sent back to the manufacturer. And, I plan on letting them know what I think of their product!"
3,Quite pricy and brief,The price is the only beef I have with this item. The material provides an excellent overview of the venture capital business but its a little pricy for 9 or so pages. I would have given it 5 stars if it had been $3.50 or less then again maybe I'm just cheap.
5,Love this product,"I use this right after I wash my hair to help with the dryness and my split ends. My hair dresser is surprised when I go 4 months without a haircut, yet my ends are still healthy. It also seems to help with controlling my frizz. I have naturally wavy/curly hair and I definately notice a difference when I don't use this!"
2,Waste of money...,I usually use Beyond the Zone's version of this but amazon doesn't care that line so i settled for this. it's not nearly as good or even worth bothering with.
5,Princess Sonya Lee & Prince Michael spin the day away!,"This is an additional set for the Lil Kingdom. It includes a pink carriage, Princess Sonya Lee, Prince Michael and a horse that can either be connected to the carriage or the horse can be ridden all by itself. Also included is a dance area so that your Little People can dance and spin the morning away!I've said it before and I'll say it again, imagination and play are so important for your child! Any Little People set or additional set can create hours of fun for both you and your child!"
1,No guarantee your dragon will eat this.,"I try to feed our dragon gut loaded dusted crickets, but when we run out I use pellet food to keep her full. I've used the colorful pellets from another brand before and our dragon will eat them no problem. This stuff is a total no-go. Not wet, like the instructions say, or dry. It must not be tasteful or have a desirable appearance or smell. In fact I went back to the other stuff and she loves it.So be aware that you might end up with a can of this stuff you can't use even if your dragon is an otherwise great eater."
4,Travelling Safely: Harder Than it Used to Be,"Christopher Barnes's Personal Travel Safety Manual is filled with useful and potentially life and property-saving advice. Most experienced global business travelers have evolved their own packing and security procedures, but all of us are likely to benefit from this comprehensive tune-up. For any novice traveler Barnes's no-nonsense compendium will be an invaluable eye-opener and resource. And yes, you can follow his recommendations and still have fun."
5,Audubon's guide to the Future,"It's odd that a book of fiction occupies pride of place in my library of natural science books. However, when I feel the need to explain evolution to a friend who falls asleep watching the Discovery Channel, this is invariably the book I reach for. Beautifully illustrated as well."
5,"Check out ""The Future Is Wild""","Thank Goodness someone has taken notice of Dougal Dixon's work, and turned it into ""The Future Is Wild"", a documentary on The Animal Planet.However, while ""The Future Is Wild"" is interesting, it is very thin in comparison with ""After Man"", since it goes from 5 million years in the future to 200 million years.""After Man"" focuses on a more recent future, and covers nearly all of the biomes on the Earth, so you get a fuller view of the ecology.Plus, nothing is extremely alien in ""After Man"" - you can see the creatures there - while the gigantic land-roving jungle squids a few times the size of elephants... oy!""After Man"" should be a must-read, especially before you watch or read ""The Future Is Wild""..."
4,The perfect combo,"I had this book when I was 16 years old and lost it somewhere, so I am buying it again almost 20 years later, now that I've found it.This book is one of the best books I've ever owned. As a kid, it was a blast. As an adult, it makes a great coffee table book. With a perfect combination of scientific explaination and clear pictures of the fantastic creatures it describes, it is impossible to put down, even after you've read it cover to cover. Leave it out on a coffee table and watch guests pick it up. Sure enough, they'll ask to borrow it."
3,"Solid food, but price increase is insane!","Been feeding this food to my Greyhound for 10 years. Was paying $40.99 from amazon. Now after nearly a 25% price increase, I am forced to shop elsewhere. Sorry, Amazon. I love ya, but the price increase is just insane. You lost my business on this product."
5,Come share Claire's true-life heart/lung transplant mystery!,"This is the true story of Claire Sylvia'sheart/lung transplant performed asYale-New Haven's first such operation back in 1988.Beyond being an excellent narrative of aninspiring transplant experience, her storydevelops into a deeper scientific mystery as sheencounters her young donor through dreams andchanges in her life. Later, Claire is able toverify that such traits and dreams have a basis inreal life when she meets her donor, Tim, throughhis family. Claire does not claim to fullyunderstand her experience, but shares with us thefacts as they became known to her. Along with aseries of less spectacular, but similar storiesfrom other transplant recipients, the book offersa short summary of scientific and otherdisciplines' current findings in this area.While each reader will draw their own conclusionas to the validity of Claire's story, all willleave this book with an expanded awareness of themystery of life as we currently understand it."
4,Worth a read,"This woman has a great attitude and good story line. She spends a bit too much time talking about the donor and the dreams that she has about it. It's much more ""story"" than just facts about her transplant. I am glad I read it though. You'll just need to balance it by reading another book on the same subject."
1,Bad writing prevents getting to know the real story.,"Sylvia's story holds some interest, but the writer who assisted in preparing the manuscript uses strung together clichés instead of a real reflection of a real person in telling the details of the transplant, and Sylvia's life before and after. I was disappointed in the presentation since I was interested in reading about life after transplant. While Sylvia obviously has a spiritual practice, the book presents it as an odd ball set of values. We can't experience with her what she experienced, as we might with better writing. Sylvia never becomes real."
4,Extremely interesting and thought provoking...,This book can be a commercialized anthropology literature. Consice yet directed to the root of questions we have for million years. Strongly recommended...
5,Humans through the lense of Cultural Materialism,"Human Kind is an expansion of Harris's favorite task; addressing apparent paradoxes in human cultural behavior. While Harris is critiqued for not producing more complete ethnographies his own nomothetic knowledge is impressive. As usual the natives are not completely aware of the reasons or consequences of their behavior. Some of the topics are more mundane than those he discussed in books like Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches, but interesting none the less. Cognitive Idealists read it an weep."
5,I searched bookstores for used copies.,"From the foot to the BMW, he covers everything from how natural selection may favor fat people (even if we don't) to dating rituals and practical advice (a great read)."
4,A different option from the run of the mill characters,"I bought this mat with the corresponding plates set. My daughter loves animals, and her meal time really flies while she entertains herself naming the pictures and their colors. The mat is a bit flimsy and I am afraid it might not last too long, but so far it has turned out to be a very good purchase."
4,Great stuff!,My dragon cant get enough of this stinky stuff but the smell doesn't last when she gobbles it all up. Makes a bit of a mess but I think it is well worth it for her.
4,pretty good finish,"this book is the last one in the goosebumps series, and it was a pretty good book. if you enjoy a bit of scary, then you will like this book. although short, it has a good ending."
4,It was cool !!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was better than the first three. Since I started reading ""Fear Street"", ""Goosebumps"" isn't as scary."
3,"Well, so, so...","I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The only thing wrong with it was...NEEDED MORE ACTION!!! Only if R.L. Stine could added more action, it would be a 5 star! I wish I could have rated it 5-star, but it was a little plain in the ""action"" part."
1,Get Real!!,"You guys can't possibly like this series! The books are so short! What good is a story with basically 5 words? 1. A-- 2. The--3. It--4. I--5. Monster--Com'on, get real! The idea's in the story are okay, but the writing style is terrible. Read something with at least a few hundred pages!PUH-LEASE"
5,The best!,More Monster Blood thrills1 the Blood is back and this time it's blue! A shiny wet giant slug is growing bigger bigger until...POP! Now there are two and they are multiplying fast!
2,Awful,"The nadir of the series, and proof that the end of the original Goosebumps line was a mercy killing. Monster Blood IV is nothing but the worst traits of the series, lined up one after another (and occasionally simultaneously) in one-hundred-plus pages of middle fingers to the reading audience. Truly Monster Blood IV is one of the worst Goosebumps books ever thrown at a public. That it was received by readers with the same enthusiasm as being peed on solves once and for all the question of how the original series earned its fate."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz....,"Just a bore. I try to read through even the Goosebumps books I'm not all that interested in; however, I just found myself skimming this book after the first ten pages. The characters are annoying and the story takes pages to describe the most pointless things, which drags out what should have been a pretty straightforward plot. Honestly, I couldn't believe how little happened over the 28 chapters. The plot isn't quite as recycled as the previous Monster Bloods, but it still failed to engage. This is the last book in the series and Goosebumps should have gone out with something higher quality than this snore-fest. I'd heard bad things about this book, but I still gave it a fair shot. Apparently it's the rarest book of the series alongside I Live In Your Basement, and didn't get a reprint. Hence, the insane price tags that you see here. That said, I can't recommend this. Just... nah."
1,junk,$25 worth of junk. I spent 30 minutes shaving my head with it and still ended up with the worst hair cut of my life. Maybe another hour or so and I can get all my hair the same length.
1,Don't waste your money. It hardly works.,"Zero stars! I'm always on the look out for a trimmer / shaver that can save me time without compromising the cut / shave. This is NOT it!The teeth are too big to get really close, it's not easy to handle, and because it's so wide, it doesn't work well on the curves of your head (which is most of it).I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
2,Not what I was looking for............,"This was not what I was looking for. I keep my head shaved (not skin), so I thought this should work great. I use it without the guards to get that close shave and it feels like it's scraping my head. The other thing I don't like about it is, that I have hold down the power button when shaving my head, kind of sucks when your trying to shave the back of your head and hold the power button on at the same time. So all in all, no I WOULD NOT recommend this product to friends and family. I can see why it was discontinued!"
5,Great Gospel Book,"This is a book that is focused on the gospel. An easy read but does not sacrifice doctrinal clarity and orthodoxy. This is a great alternative to the ""new"" emerging Christian messages. Chapters on legalism and condemnation are particularly powerful. Great read for new Christians and Christians needing to kneel at the cross anew."
5,excellent,"great book, were are using it in our bible study class and it is very easy reading and makes alot of sense.."
4,"Useful, whether you start a writing group or not!","This book contains writing exercises that can be useful to you whether or not you join (or start) a writing group.I enjoyed this book because it discusses the writing process, and how the group experience can help/hinder it. Also, the authors point out the obstacles to maintaining a group over time, and give suggestions on how to handle such situations based on their own experience as members of the same women's writing group.Entertaining, if you want to find out what a writing group might be like before you join one."
3,Deliberate Camp Rock Opera,"This is Bat Out of Hell repackaged. No weak tracks. A cool, campy rock opera concept album about a man who goes to hell for his sins. Updated from the original version for more of a gothic opera a la Rocky Horror. More sensitive than Bat II. I like it a lot."
4,"WHERE IS ""LOST LOVE""","HITS OUT OF HELL, ROCK AND ROLL HERO & THE VERY BEST are the Best of all the Meat Loaf albums - ALL the Meat Loaf albums!But one thing - PARADISE is not the last song on HITS OUT OF HELL That credit goes to LOST LOVE (a song by unknown) which has mysteriously never been on any Meat Loaf album...I reckon it's an outtake from MIDNIGHT... but why?!If you find HITS make sure the last song is LOST LOVEBecause that is the reason why the album's worth buying!Whoever's selling these shoddy versions of HITS with PARADISE as the last song should be made to pay!"
4,Cassette replacement,I love all of Meatloafs earlier work. Being that my new car has a CD player and not a cassette player is the reason for buying this disk.I love to crank up the volume and listen to the bass.
1,Hell is right,"It is difficult to think of a more apporpriate title for an album of Meat Loaf ""hits"" than ""Hits Out of Hell"" (ok, excpet for maybe ""Hits FROM Hell""). Listen to this album IS hell, and I've no doubt this is from where they came. Horrible!"
4,The nitty-gritty of C++,"This is an excellent book on C++, although I have newer books published After the ANSI Standardisation of C++, Mark Terribile's book gives a much more detailed explanation of the basics of C++. The book explains the mechanisms of constructors, object initialisation, and inheritance far better than other books I have seen. The ONLY reason I don't give this book 5 stars, is that it is Pre ANSI C++, and doesn't cover the STL, or other late additions to ANSI C++, such as Run Time Type Identification. PLEASE I want a New Edition of this Book!"
3,"Not bad, but it could be better","This book tells almost nothing about Axis occupation of Greece 1941-1944. There's no description at all of occupation regimes and domestic collaboration with Axis powers, little about the life in Greece during the occupation, while the military situation in Greece and battles fought there between the occupation powers and the resistance are also not duly dealt with.After the WW II, there's insufficient attention given to political and social developments in Greece other than those related to the Communist insurgency. Elections and the referendum on republic vs. monarchy in 1946 are barely mentioned, with no results presented. On the other hand, the autor delved too deep into details in describing some battles.On the positive side, this book is good in describing activities of the Greek Communist party, the role of foreign factors in Greece affairs and the civil war 1946-1946, its military aspect, in particular."
5,The Strugle for Greece 1941-40,Very intereseted book for someone who likes to read and lern the real story.I like Amazon because most of the times I fount what I want.
3,Aristotelian Design,"If you've ever read ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" this book is an example of how not to teach something. Much like Aristotle categorized philosophy, Wong goes through the exercise of categorizing, splitting, and defining design in tremendous detail, but misses something fundamental in the design process.That being said, if you just want a book of rational analysis and definitions, that will teach you the basics of the vocabulary of design, this is an excellent book. It's a good reference, with a lot of examples, but next-to-impossible to read straight through."
2,Obtuse and wordy,"I purchased this textbook as a course requirement, and the teacher never even referred to it. Opening it on my own, I found the layout incomprehensible, and much of the discussion inside it obtuse. I think this book would only be of interest to those who are already extremely familiar with the subject of graphic design."
3,A good text for discrete mathematics !,"This is a very good text book for use in a discrete mathematics class. It is also good for someone who would like to learn a lot of good math by learing the ISETL interactive computer language on their own. But the casual reader should beware, this book will take a lot of hard work. ISETL (Interactive Set Language) can now be downloaded from the net free of charge. It is a language specially developed to teach mathematics. Discrete math is of special interest to computer programers."
1,Worked Great...For a month!!,At first I was very happy with the product. Brought it on a family camping trip. Using only LED's it lasted whole trip.Took it out a few nights ago before a big storm to make sure it was charged. Bulb won't come on. Left it charging for ages but charge light always indicates it is very low...not enough for power bulb. Finally checked charge on battery and found only 3.5v came out.Word of advice...save your reciept!!
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought one as an emergency light/radio for our home. Worked great out of the box after we charged it. Six months later after a severe storm, we turned it on and nothing...After the power at the house came back on we tried to charge it by leaving the unit plugged in for 15 hours. Dead as a doornail. This seems to be a common problem. I'm glad we didn't need this in a life or death situation. Don't waste your money."
1,Defective Light,"I had puchased two of the TrailTracker lanterns for a kayaking trip, but the fluorescent tube on both of them failed after a couple days although the batteries were fully charged. These were exchanged for two other laterns but both of those failed also after a few days. My sister had purchased two of these and the main bulb quit working a week later. There should be a recall on this item."
1,No lamp after first couple uses,Loved this when we first bought it but after the first few uses the bulb never came on again. The battery won't hold a charge at all and won't even charge up when on direct power. Nothing in the manual explains this. The battery is supposed to be rechargeable but it really isn't. It's lifespan is extremely short.Very unhappy with this unit. I can get radio (and light!) more reliably on my smartphone than off this thing and just need to use my car to charge it up.
1,Vector Power on Board,"That's .001 of a STAR. In reading the reviews posted...I do not feel alone anymore! The main light no longer functions. Used it once and then recharged. No lamp light. LED's work wonderfully and so does the Tin-E toned radio. I now have a two ton paper weight that glows in the dark! I didn't think any product could be worse than a Black and Decker product.....hmmm, B&D bought out Vector?.... ROFL....fooled me too many times but this was pure stealth! Shame on Sam's Club. Amazon rules!"
3,"Main light quit working, otherwise ok","We got this 2 years ago for a camping trip. It still works, but the main light has quit working. The radio, and LED lights still work, but like previous person stated, the LED's are not really bright enough for anything major."
3,Useful manual for improve your reading,"Very useful manual for improve reading. Although, the first edition is better since it contains more topics and answers for the exercises."
2,For Shame,"I am a huge fan of the Arc The Lad series. I loved the collection and Twilight Of Spirits. After reading the stories about this game, I thought ""Oh my god, Arc is being ressurected!"" Unfortunately, NO ONE from any of the past games make a big influence in this ""Story"". Darc and Kharg are gone along with most of the awesome Deimos characters. The cast from 1,2 and 3 return in the form of cards that you battle with. I thought the story line was incredibly stupid. They try to bring back the idea of guilds and hunters from Arc The Lad 2 and 3. It wasn't surprising when the idea fell through. There is no real reason to continue playing after you finish the main storyline except to see Delma and Volk make a two-minute appearence. Even if you are a fan of the series like me, heed my advice and just play twilight of spirits or the collection again and steer clear of this one. For shame Namco, for shame"
4,The most satisfying of the Bounty Hunter books,"Hard Merchandise : Star Wars: Book 3 of The Bounty Hunter Warsby K.W. Jeter continues the story of Boba Fett, Neelah and Dengar after the battle on Tatooine. This book had the most surprises and was really unique in both the style and tone. I really enjoyed reading it. Overall the only problem I really had with the series was the characterization of Dengar as a not so brutal bounty hunter, something that takes away a little from the character. Other than that I have to give Jeter high marks for effort. He took the most mysterious and one of the most cherished characters in the Star Wars universe and crafted a well-written tale that did not totally destroy the perception of that character. Well done Mr. Jeter."
5,A complete change from the other books!,The book is very well done. The characters in it are so different from the one in the other books. If you like Boba Fett and the other bounty hunters this book is for you. I'd recomend it to people who have read many other Star Wars books before you read this trilogy. It was great!
3,"Slow start, anticlimactic","I guess I expected more because the first two in the series were pretty good. I thought it took way too long to get started (the first hundred pages are just about useless). I think Boba Fett was entirely un-Fett like. He seems soft in this installment. Why is Dengar such a wuss in this series. I can't really recommend this book, except that it finishes the series. It could have been condensed and been great. For better Fett and Dengar reading, get ""Tales of the Bounty Hunters"""
4,Hard Merchandise is unbelievable!,"The book is absolutely action-packed, and is a wanderful end to the ""Bounty Hunter Wars"" series. It's definitely the best book in the series, thrilling from beginning to end. I hope this is not the last of the bounty hunters. This book has left me wanting more."
3,A let down. (possible spoilers),"I had enjoyed the previous two books in the series, but was disapointed in this. The whole back story of the split of the guilds was worthless to the overall plot. The story moved slowly. This series could would have been better and shorter if the back story was not included. Boba Fett was just a little two big of a genius to be believable."
3,Continuation of the Bounty Hunter Wars,"This book will be a continuation of The Bounty Hunter Wars, which have the books The Mandalorian Armor, and Slave Ship, as its first two parts, respectively.Since I have not yet read this (since it is not out yet), but have read the first two parts, I would buy. I only suggest buying it if you have already read the first two, but as a warning, The Bounty Hunter Wars series is not one of the most solid. In short, if you haven't started these books yet, don't bother. Just know they are slightly subpar, although Timothy Zahn, the premiere Star Wars Expanded Universe author is apparently working on the installment.Don't let this series get you down. There are plenty of other Star Wars novels that are great. The Bounty Hunter Wars is decent, but lacks some aspects of the other books since it lacks having the main characters as Han, Luke, Chewie, and Leia."
2,Will the real boba fett step forward.,"There are very few books that I have to have. When I heard that there was going to be a series featuring many of the bounty hunters I just couldn't wait. Now having read all 3 I think to myself, were any of the hunters in the series. Sure the names were there but not the characters. Boba Fett just talked to anyone who would listen like a drunk at a bar. All of the other hunters acted like fools. There is no way Vader would have selected these losers if they were like they are in this series. It had such potential to show the hunters in detail and to give us more info about them. In the end it was a case of finish it so that i could go on to another book. If you have read the first 2 and want to know how it ends then read it. Otherwise read some of the other starwars books. In the future I hope that there will be a series that is written on the hunters, with a book for each one. This could have been a good start, but just keeps coming up short."
2,Could have been much much better.,"I waited until I finished all three books before reviewing 'cos the earlier books just left a lot of frustrations.In the last book of the Trilogy, lo and behold, the other bounty hunters are finally acting more like; bounty hunters; instead of greenhorns and fumbling idiots.Disappointingly, the sinister plots that were hinted at in the first two books turned out to be rather shallow or practically non-existent.What is distracting is the author's using of metric units of measurements in the last book while using ""Standard ... Unit"" in the first two.Of course, the scratchings on the Slave I cargo hold etc were not explained satisfactorily, or why was an intact hard merchandise delivered in the first book described as dead in the last book.Makes me wonder who's really writing the book, or how many of them."
4,An excellent conclusion,"There was a lot of twists and turns in this trilogy's plot, and this book does a good job of tying down the loose ends. I had one problem this book, though, at the end, Boba Fett miraculously is able to fly a star destroyer all by himself. But, besides this, it's a good read."
3,"Star Wars -Hard Merchandise, book 3 of 3- (Seafire12)","Finally an end to this series. Most of your question are answered, although maybe not to the fullest or with thought behind them. None the less they are answered. The entire plot for the Bounty Hunter Wars and the destruction of the Bounty Hunters Guild is ridiculous. Xizors plan had no purpose or meaning in anyway. Once you read the first book your going to have to read them all so beware! If you don't mind reading the three books then go ahead and pick up the first one. But I warn you once you begin, no matter how dumb the books are, you have to finish them to get the answer to the pointless puzzle."
3,Not what I was expecting it would be,"I was expecting to find out where Bobe Fett came from. This series did not give me anything along those lines. I enjoyed the story, but not much action."
1,"If you have read the first two books buy it, otherwise don't","I read the first two books of this series and was not impressed at all, i had to read this one to find out what happened in the end. Nothing is the answer, it was far too predictable, there were a few twists but nothing that really interested me. At the end i just felt cheated for buying the whole trilogy. Boba Fett is by far the best character in the whole galaxy because of his general mysteriousness, if you're looking to find out something about him you're better off not buying this book. It left me infuriated in the way it finished and devastated that Lucas could sanction such mindless drivel under the great name of Star Wars. Not Reccomended."
2,Good that turns sour,"I just finished the book not long ago and the ending was just down right pathetic! Too many things were wrong in the ending to make me recommend this book to anyone. The first 17 chapters were good and I enjoyed the series till that point, but the end didn't hold true to the Star Wars I know. I think the ending was written too quickly and it made the Star Wars galaxy seem to fit in my backyard. I think the ending betrayed any Star Wars fan who spent any amount of time researching past what was in the movies."
1,Too bad I have to give it a star.,"I have not finished this book, but I will review the whole trilogy here. If the author of this book would bother to read Tales of the Bounty Hunters or even the X-Wing books, he would realize that Zuckuss was a completly different character than the Gand in this book. No Gand (if other books are correct) would use pronouns. Since Gands happen to be one of my favorite species in Star Wars, having Zuckuss constantly say ""I"" was anoying. 4-LOM has a vision in Tales of the Bounty Hunters of himself as a Jedi. I have been waiting for the book which expands on this, and I have learned that in fact, Zuckuss and 4-LOM never intended on joining the Alliance. I would suggest that you ignore this entire series."
5,I did not know Star Wars books were THIS good!,"I've read Slave Ship, the first Star Wars book I ever read. I was not sure what it would be like, but it turned out to be brilliant, with twists and turns to keep anyone on the edge of their seat, including people who think they know everything about Fett anf Bossk. The conclusion is really something!"
3,a very anti climactic conclusion,"these books werent bad but they could have been better. i think the best parts took place ""then"" as opposed to ""now"". all of the schemeinhg going on was cool it was just the reasoning behind everything was just so stupid. i mean come on why would the emporer really care about the bounty hunters and their guild. so the empire could hire the best? they could do that anyway. it just didnt really make much sense to me. but al the action was good and i liked seeing the interaction bossk and the other bounty hunters had with fett. it was also cool seeing bounties being collected. just the ending is a little of a letdown"
2,Only timothy zahn could save this series.,"I read the first book, and was very disappointed in it. It was pretty much Boba Fett going around and making every one else look like a fool. Its story line was lack luster, its supporting characters dumb, and mostly didn't follow any other stories about the bounty hunters (i.e. tales of the bounty hunters). the only reason i could give this series 2 stars was because zahn (the best of the star wars writers) is helping with it. without him, this series is dead."
5,I hope Boba Fett vapes Bossk!!!,I can't wait till Hard Merchandise comes out. I loved the first two of the bounty wars trilogy. Im sure this will be awesome!What most want to see is Boba Fett vapin people. ESPECIALLY BOSSK!!!!!!!
4,In case you're wondering....,"The Bounty Hunter Wars series is an excellent series. I would not, however, read any of the books by itself. You will be left hanging. I appreciate the fact that the author pulled in new characters, instead of the overworked original series."
4,This books presents a subject that has long been ignored.,"This book presents a subject that has long been ignored by the rest of America. The shameful events Black soldiers had to endure have been swept under the rug for to many years. This book lightly touches on the prejudice that took place during the WWII. There is still much that needs to be told. However, the records are basically kept secret. Due to again to the powers that be in DC and the monumental cost of obtaining these records."
2,"So-so, with one exception","This is average House Music, but Joint is Jumpin' is hyper hot, a terrific song. The rest is nothing special, not very exciting, and sometimes dumb, even by the standrads of dance music. The title cut has ridiculous lyrics. I know, you don't expect much of this kind of cut--and that's the problem--they offer too much chant/talk and it's not inspiring. It undercuts the music, and I just wanted to shout Enough!"
1,Made in Taiwan!,"For the price, and from Mayhew, I was expecting a made in the USA set of picks. These are actually made in Taiwan. While normally that's better than China, it still doesn't warrant the price charged for these picks. The Ullman and Wilde tool sets are cheaper and are made in the USA. These are not what I was expecting at all."
1,A real disappontment,"Sorry, Nicky. I bought your first CD, *still* digging ""Lady Killer"" after all these years. And there were a couple other cuts from that CD that grew on me, like ""Tongue-Tied & Twisted."" Unfortunately, this collection has nothing of interest and is downright banal. Hate to say it, because I'm a FAN, but was hoping for more along the lines of LK that had a LOT of strength, particularly in its production."
3,A fan of Nicky,"This is not her best album, but the range of talent is still present. Give her a listen and become a fan."
2,SOPHMORE SLUMP,"I was working at SONYMUSIC when a coworker plopped ""Ladykiller""on my desk for a listen..WOW! What a find!!!!! loved every cut.Sence And Sensuality was a major dissappointment, except for""Hat Full Of Stars"" [flawlessly covered by Cyndi Lauper] andthe ethereal and synthy, ""Lay Down"" Most of the tracks arenon-commercial and too under-produced. I've added my favoritesongs [mentioned] to my ""Nicky Holland Playlist"" I still willpurchase her next CD, as she still is one of my favorite singer/songwriters."
4,Sound Great,Lets face it - most of the reason people buy these is becaause they make your car sound mean and these deliver. I thought about Magnaflows but a buddy sugested these instead and I am not dissapointed at all with my choice.
2,Don't by this junk,"I Bought this last spring for the forward and reverse shifter on my golf cart, only used golf cart on weekends and only to shift into forward or reverse and by october the chrome was warn off most of the skull well I imagine that if you use for a shifter for a 4 speed it would last little more then a month"
2,Doesn't fit my car,"It is not universal, doesn't fit a car if it has a pin that holds it in, only works with cars that have screws to hold the knob on. But it looks good and shiny"
4,Unforeseen,"I'm simply at a loss for words of how much this piece has changed my life. My self esteem has nearly tripled now that I'm the baddest man in town, thanks to my shiny new chrome skull knob. These are going to be (MARK MY WORDS) the next big trend to hit the states. But you'll all be following in my adidas because I beat you all to the punch."
1,Impractical,"I did not like this book because all the answers to the problems are listed in plain sight immediately below the questions. Just in reading through them I catch sight of the answers and it is very impractical. I prefer the ""Dummies"" workbook."
3,"Sway is good, but the music video is much better.","Hi,The music video was cool, especially the model in the bikini at the start, and as a air hostess. They should have released the music video on VCD or DVD too.I think that the song is good, but unfortunately, there is only one verse. when the marimba rhythms star to play dance with me, make me sway, when the ocean hugs the the floor hold me close sway me more. again, again and again.I liked the haat cha cha cha cha bits."
5,3 videos of Tommy Page,"Interview + video of Shoulder to cry on, Zillion kisses and I'll be your everything."
5,a favorite!,"I'm not sure what the other reviewer's concerns with the pictures are -- they look pretty true to the Thomas figures in the toys to me. At any rate, this book was one of my oldest son's favorites, and is definitely my younger son's favorite now. The peek-a-boo concept has been a big hit with both of them. And it is *much* sturdier than ""lift-the-flap"" type books."
2,not a winner,"I gave this book two stars because it is a Thomas the Tank Engine book and because the peek-a-boo concept is a hit with toddlers. But the illustrations--good grief! All of the children look like fat white worms. Toddlers don't necessarily need Monet, but the book is not at all visually appealing."
1,STAY AWAY!,"Stay away from all movies made by ""The Asylum"" movie company. They are all the true meaning of B-horror: Bad acting, bad FX, grainy picture/home movie qaulity"
3,Pleasant Low-Fi Slowcore Twee Pop,Traveling slowly from Low Fi to Slowcore to Twee Pop - it's all very professional and pleasant but doesn't range much beyond what might be a pleasant evening in a club bar - nothing particularly memorable.
5,splendid read,"Andrea Barret has to be a genius. The eight stories are laced together with fascinating science and solid historical fact but each takes off in entirely different directions in her fabulous imagination. She is a gifted storyteller, there is plenty of suspense to keep the reader turning the page. Yet, there is the learning and wisom that only a true genius, a born writer, can impart.I flipped through the book with a group of friends and read aloud the opening sentence to a few of the stories. The stories are captivating from the first line."
1,science-lovers only....,"ugh. as a confessed bibliophile, i honestly try to give every single book its due. but this one was impossible...poetic, but impossible. barrett attempts to weave these stories about antiquated botanists into one connective tissue but it is too far a stretch. unless you eat, breath and sleep xylem and phloem, don't waste time trying to pad through this book."
2,Upsetting,"Well, i am with the person from Watertown. This book was a required read (god knows why) it is completely uneventful. A collection of stories that lack a point. The Ship FEver story is okay, but not worth the read unless you are interested in this time period."
1,"Fed Up with ""Fever""","We read this book for my literature class, and I just could not stand it. It didn't keep me interested for one moment - if I could, I would have put the book down after the second page, and I never stop reading books once I start. This is the first book I've ever read that I couldn't get into, and I hope it's the last."
1,Save your money,"Very shallow thinking and some factual errors, one of which leads to an entirely fallacious conclusion. Sloppily researched and edited. Reads like a failed PhD thesis."
2,"A classic, but shows its age","Barber's treatise was seminal and has been quite well-received. It is well-written and interesting. However, the psychology is archaic. Barber postulates two dimensions of presidential personality: Activity and positive vs. negative orientation. This is an arbitrary and very incomplete perspective on personality - which incidentally, has been studied very extensively in psychology over the past 50 years or so. The assessment of a given president's standing on each trait is entirely Barber's, not the result of any formal attempt at measurement or a consensus of experts. In sum, this is an armchair psychological analysis, with virtually no connection to other attempts to understand personality or its relationship to leadership."
5,"A quick, exciting whirlwind","This is a fantastic book if what you are looking for is a sharp jolt of entertainment and a little bit of dry humor. Matheny does a great job of describing the lives of his insensitive rich brat characters. The unappealing characters are appropriately vapid, the setting is accurately pretentious...but the main character Greg is strangely likeable and pathetic all at once. For a first-time writer, I'd say it was pretty good overrall."
2,good book?,"This book has been reviwed a little too high. It's a teenagers book. Perfect for my 16yr old, not perfect for anyone mature and over the age of 18. It was all right if you want a horrible ending. Don't read this book. Save your time."
3,Too many indian words,"I liked the book, but there is too many Indian words. I could not keep up because I needed to constantly go back to another page in order to remember what a word meant."
2,a very studious read,What a disappointment! So many other fabulous yoga books out there written in a friendly and nurturing way with beautiful illustrations. In this book the illustrations are accurate but there is no beauty. That is also how I felt about the writing. If you just want an intellectual approach to yoga this book might do the trick. I think yoga deserves so much more.
4,Miles Davis was young once upon a time.....,"In search of recently released post-bop sounds, I noticed a CD cover with a kid blowing a trumpet. The ""Tower Record Store"" was featuring this new Jazz CD and so I picked up the headset to listen. I was quite impressed. As I listened, hummed and patted hand and foot, another jazz fan asked what was I listening to. I gave her the headphones and she never passed them back! This young kid, Christian Scott, nephew of Donald Harrison-saxophonist, had come out with an excellent first release. Both of us were very impressed. As we talked, a third person came over and began to listen. Soon, the three of us began discussing the CD and agreed that this kid could be the next Miles. Sure, that was a stretch but the kid was good and his CD had a great sound. We all purchase the CD on the spot.A young Miles Davis would stop and check this kid out. You should too!swaleed"
5,Rewind that a winner,"It's so nice to get a new jazz cd where the artists main interest isn't showing you how fast they can play. This whole cd is rhythmic and seducing as Christian Scott and his band blend beautifully together. As a musician, it's wonderful to hear jazz players play as a team instead of a bunch of individuals. Scotts band does so to a tee."
4,"This is a fresh album, presenting a player with impressive potential.","After seeing Christian Scott live with Dick Oatts last year, I could tell he would eventually be a force to be reckoned with in the jazz world. This album shows his continuing development.[...] I feel this is not an example of traditional jazz. Scott's performance on this CD shows his ability to play jazz with a funk/rock vibe. He is very talented playing in a more traditional style, but this CD is an example of his ability to innovate in a more contemporary genre. Hints from Sketches of Spain, a dreamy free-flowing Miles Davis album, are evident in Scott's album, and the expressive melodies and solos he performs are wonderfully lyrical, showing the Miles influence. His chops are exhibited by his ability to flow in and out of the changes with ease.Despite my focus on his potential, even if Scott wasn't the young player he is, the album would still be worth the purchase. I recommend ""Rewind That"" strongly."
1,Cheap Quality,"Owned this fan for about 3 months. It now rattles like a cheap low quality fan. This was supposed to be a heavy duty ""commercial"" fan but it rattles just like any other cheap fan. Definitely do not recommend this fan!"
2,"good concept, poor execution","I'm so tired of evil, insane wizards as the antagonist. And the protagonist is a passive girl who needs saving every step of the way. I can't help but think that the story would have been more interesting from the apprentices point of view, at least then the protagonist would have proactive, but I'm not sure it would really have helped. The balance of power was so obviously in favor of the apprentice, the reader has to wonder why he was playing such a silly game with the insane antagonist.The author kept covering the same ground over and over until I wanted to scream. If you're wondering why I kept reading, well, for the most part I did start skimming about 2/3s of the way through, I was so tired of hearing the girl wondering about who she should trust, ""remembering"" things the reader already knew, whining to herself about how she ""just couldn't"" do, resisting the things that would save her, and vicilitating all over the place."
5,Hoag Never Disappoints,"This is the 4th book that I have read by Hoag and she is an author who never disappoints her readers. She continues to put out page turner after page turner. This, her latest book, is terrific with likeable characters especially Quinn."
2,I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS BOOK.,"I HAVE READ MANY OF TAMI HOAG'S BOOKS AND WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HER LATEST EFFORT. I AM ONLY MIDWAY THROUGH THE BOOK AND THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS ME GOING IS THE DETERMINATION TO FINISH WHAT I STARTED. THE CHARACTERS AREN'T DEVELOPING. WE KNOW EVERYBODY HAS A STORY AND SOME HAVE A HISTORY TOGETHER, BUT NO HINT OR CLUE AS TO WHAT BROUGHT THEM TO THIS POINT. I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED HER WRITING AND ALTHOUGH I PREFER HER EARLIER WORKS I ENJOYED HER MORE RECENT UNTIL THIS ONE. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,Poorly written with little character development,"This book deserves to die along with the killer Ms. Hoag writes about. It is so crammed with shallow characters that you'll need to list each one's bio to struggle through this mess. And this is by third chapter.Chapter one we meet the killer, loose him through the middle, then find him again in the end. She attempts to establish a connection between the book's mob of characters, but we never get to know them---nor do we want too. So many shallow characters only fill space. The only thing worse than reading this book is to listen to it on tape. The reader only adds to the pain.Bury the book and the tape, and take Ms. Hoag's word processor away, and never use this reader again---if let loose either one might hurt someone with a similar project."
3,It was okay...,"Former FBI member Kate Conlan teams up with old flame John Quinn in a grisly case involving a serial killer called the cremator. While I enjoyed the overall premise of the story I thought at times the author tended to restate the same things over and over regarding the personal lives, etc. of the characters, thus causing the novel to lose steam at certain points. I was however, surprised by the identity of the killer. Overall an okay read for a rainy day!"
4,Got me started on Tami Hoag,This was the first book I read by this author and now I'm addicted. Her style of writing is fast paced and entertaining.Suspense that makes you want to stay up all night..............
4,"VIOLENT, GRAPIC, EDGE OF YOUR SEAT","This is my first Tami Hoag book, and in fact it is my first proper thriller book but I found it brilliant. I thought that the last few paragraphs were a bit too violent and graphic for my liking but all the same this book has encouraged me to read more of her books. Make sure you've got all the doors and windows locked when reading this one!"
2,Disappointed,"As someone who has read all of Tami Hoag's books, this one is the worst. I was very disappointed. Reading this book rates right up there with being in the dentist's chair. The only thing that kept me from finishing this was a determination to do so. She spends so much time on the police and their lives that you never really know much about the criminal. Would not recommend!"
1,Waste of time!,About the only pages worth reading are the first few chapters and the last few chapters. What a waste of all the middle pages! Conversations are all the same over and over again. They couldn't even figure out the ties between the three women. Give me a break!I would not suggest anyone read this. I'm sorry I did.
2,2 stars - formulaic,"It sucks to have to type a review in order to rate an item to get recommendations now that they've taken that feature away. If it irritates you to have to read this, tell Amazon.com to bring back the ""rate this item"" feature."
2,Disappointing,"I found the book very disappointing compared with other books by the same author. The characters were ill defined, you were never sure whether a character was male or female. The plot jumped around without definition ie it moved to different scenes without this being very clear to the reader."
2,65% boring; 35% good (not great),"I was looking for a new mystery/thriller writer and decided to try Hoag. This was my first, and it will proably be my last. The book can't figure out whether it's a romance or a mystery/thriller. It starts off as the latter, then spends the bulk of the book agonizing over the romance of the two main characters. As a romance, I can't say, since I don't read them. As a mystery/thriller, it's adequate and not badly written. But not well written either. I'd say it's adequate. Hoag's not in the same league with Michael Connelly, John Sandford, Dennis Lehane, Robert Crais, etc.The characters are not very real, the plotting is mundane and not particularly inventive. The book is readable, but overly long. Hoag seemed to be unable to figure out whether she was more interested in whether John and Kate were going to find true love, or whether they were going to find the serial killer.Guarantee you can do better than this one."
3,this was ok.....,"....but nothing special. The plot read like a textbook on serial sexual sadists, and I figured out pretty quickly who the killer was, and that always takes my enjoyment down a notch or two. Also, the editing was horrible! Spelling AND content mistakes...on one page, Kate is taking off her sweater and on the next page, John is ripping the same sweater off her!"
4,This book kept me guessing until the end. I loved it!,"Being from Minnesota and being familiar with the streets, parks and buildings mentioned in the book added to my enjoyment! I like mysteries and romance and Tami has a good mix. The story was sometime cruesome and hard for me to imagine, it was also hard to put down."
3,"Predictable, but a fun read","There aren't a lot of surprises here: the sexual tension and inevitable pairing of the main hero and herione left me saying ""jeez..not THAT old story again"". On the other hand, the action is fast-paced and interesting, even though I'm fairly sure the average reader will guess the identity of the Cremator long before the cops and FBI profiler do. Hoag has obviously read Thomas Harris, and knows a good thing when she sees it. Not as good as Harris, but fine as a good beach book."
4,Very Suspenseful but watch out for graphic sex and language!,"This is the first Tami Hoag book I have read. I found her listed as an author that writes in the same style and genre as Iris Johansen (who is wonderful!). I enjoyed the book, seemed a little slow getting started but buyer beware if you are offended by graphic violence, sexual fantasies and language. I can stomach a lot but this was pushing it even for me. If the book was movie I would rate it VERY ""R"". However, the characters relationships were masterfully built and the clues subtle but plentiful! I can't deny it kept me on the edge of my seat!"
4,Impressive!!,"Although parts of this novel were a little cheesey (for lack of a better word), all-in-all if you're looking for a suspenseful thriller then this book won't disappoint you! A real page-turner!! Tammy Hoag kindof scares me now (she looks so innocent on the jacket cover). Excellent read!!"
4,"Good, Fast Read","Good read. Not one of her better works but still an enjoyable read. BUT what the hell happened to Thor (the cat) after the house fire?? It is not like the author to leave such loose ends in her book!!Does Kate just keep ""throw-away"" cats???"
4,"Read it when you have an ""all day to give""","Very good details, suspense and holds your attention well. The ending had a double surprise that you will enjoy, so even if you read part of the ending first...it can still grab you. Tami Hoag has gotten to read much like Patricia Cornwall..but that is good. I liked the book, but noticed a publishing error on page 7 a few lines down. This book is well worth reading."
3,Nothing New here,"I found this book, my first Tami Hoag, to be a typical book for this genre. This book does not break any new ground in thrillers. It mixed a lot of good writing with some unneeded and tangent storylines. A few good characters developed, but I had a hard time connecting with the protagonist, Kate. Guessing the killer was somewhat easy and then also somewhat difficult, because of the usual last minute plot twist that is found in books of this type.I felt it was reminiscent of the Kay Scarpetta series of books by Patricia Cornwell, but not on the same level as John Sanford or Jeffery Deaver. Despite the tone of this review, I am looking forward to the next book Dust to Dust, featuring two of the best characters of this book: Kovac and Liska."
3,uneven,"This was a twisty murder mystery that was tainted by a ridiculous love story that Tami force feeds down our throat. She put way to much energy into building this love story and not enough time giving us insight into the evil character. Also, I think the violence that everyone talks about is overblown. James Patterson was much more graphic in Kiss the Girls. Anyway, I give this book a luke warm reccomendation."
3,"Good, but I've read better..","This was the first Tami Hoag novel I've read. I found it to be good, but not overly wonderful as some others have claimed. I thought it meandered a bit, and I found the main character to be a little too tough and quite bitchy. The killer was indeed disturbed, but I've books with better more scary villans. A lot of twists and turns, but the ending, for me at least, came up a bit flat. It was a good read to pass the time, but it's not on my shelf as a ""keeper""."
2,It's all right -- nothing great,"I read the book. It is all right. Nothing great. Most of the time the flow of the story was quite interesting, but sometimes I wondered if Ms. Hoag gets paid by the word. Some relationships in the story were not necessary, except for filling up pages. The characters are good, but the end does not make much sense. Why did this person do it? How come the person appears in the role it does at the end ONLY? Nah, I have read much better."
4,Good procedural but the crimes are a bit much,"Although I have read hundreds of mysteries and thrillers, this was my first book by Tami Hoag - and I was pleased to have found her. Ashes to Ashes is a police procedural set in Minneapolis, wher the cops are trying to find a particularly sadistic serial murderer of young women.The cops have the politicains on their backs, and the state's wealthiest man gets involved, too, calling in an FBI profiler when his daughter goes missing.I enjoyed the procedural aspects and despite the gruesome nature of the crimes, Hoag doesn't dwell on the details as much as some of her contemporaries do. Still, it's not for the squeamish. There's a nifty and credible plot twist at the end, and I recommend this for fans of the genre."
2,Again?,"If you have read books about serial killers, here it is again. Especially if you have read other Tami Hoag books, the pattern and format is the same. Some romance, some sex, some mystery but by the end you'll wish the author had left out the gratuitous graphics of the murders."
2,ashes to ashes,"Interesting book. I read the whole thing even though it read like a made for tv movie, real predictable, but still kept my attention. The ending seemed to come from nowhere though. I felt cheated with the ending, I expected more from a 600 page book. I'm from minnesota and I'am familliar with minneapolis, and found the references distracting. I would of been happier not knowing which town it took place in."
2,NOT A THRILLER,"The little tuturial on the back of the book seemed a little deciving along with many of the customer reviews. I was under the impression that this was going to be a serial killer ""THRILLER"". Much to my surprise it was a drawn out love story with a tlittle bit of murder. Ever time you thought yoou were going to get in to the mind of the villian it stopped and went back to the love story.The only reason I gave this book two stars is cause it did have a good insite to the police works into a murder investigation. And there was some good humor in a few af the characters.For all you who thought this was a good thriller, and to those of you who agree with me on what a good serial killer novel should be about I recomend ""COLD COLD HEART"" BY JAMES ELLIOT."
3,It is worth reading.,"This book does make me wanna puke sometimes because of its violent description.But nevertheless,this book still has its charm in suspence.It has an even more unexpected ending than the rest of Tami's other novels.But to me the beginning of the story is quite draggy though."
5,could not put it down,"Read all of Tami Hoag's books and loved this one as I did the others. If I could have, I would have read it nonstop. As it was, I read it within a couple of days. She kept me guessing as to whom the villian was."
3,Too graphic and violent - not a fun read,Tami used to write romantic suspense. Now the violence is too graphic for my taste and there is not enough character development. This is my last Hoag book.
5,Very Intense!,"I have read this book along with many others of Tami Hoag's books. This is a very graphic, and intense book. You really should buy it, its worth the money!"
3,"READ PREVIEW FIRST!!! Sex, torture, incest, Very Dark","I really enjoyed the quality of the writing, but that said,This book is grim, dark, and horribly grisly with graphic scenes including nightmare-inducing characters. The reviews didn't make me realize what this book was really like, and having read a couple of this authors prior books didn't help either. I wish I had known, but silly me I just ordered it expecting something very different.READ THE PREVIEW BEFORE BUYING to see if you think you'll enjoy it, that might help you decide. That's what I'll do on any more of her books BEFORE I buy them."
3,Eh,"Not a bad book...I like Kovac and Liska, and I'm glad they were part of the book, anyway. Tami got her start as a romance novelist, and this isn't too far from her romance roots, despite the (yummy creepy) gore. What bothers me most about this is the REVIEWS! How come all the people who seem to love love love this book for no particular reason other than they love love love this book can't spell or write a coherent sentence? These are my students who read Cliff's Notes. If you are going to PUBLISH A REVIEW, please at least make it LOOK like you are somewhat literate. Sheesh."
4,characters to characters,"tami hoag has written an engrossing serial killer thriller.however,it took me a long while to stay focused on the mystery. there were just too many characters.everytime,i figured out who is who,she added another one."
3,ASHES TO ASHES,"Good story and characters. Kate spent too much time dwelling about her earlyer life with Quinn and other problems. Very repititous. Started skipping over these parts. However, I had many ideas about how this was going to end and I wasn't even close."
4,A thriller,"Hoag teams her heroine, a former FBI agent, Kate now a witness advocate with her ex-lover ace FBI profiler, Quinn. She weaves many twists and turns into her serial murderer thriller.Kate's acid comments to and about her superior could be fatal to her career as well as her life. Believing her witness could be the bullet that kill both of them. A bit of Midwest political intrigue brought in another dimension to the story line."
4,a good read,"Tami Hoag is a good mystery writer. She just keeps them coming and they are solid mystery books which we love to read.This particular good is the normal good, solid read for mystery fans and they will enjoy it.The characters are believable and the plot moves you along with it.Read it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Good thriller/suspense with well-developed characters,"I'll avoid the review of the plot that you can find above or in other reviews and just give you my opinion. This is one of the better Tami Hoag books that I've read - it's, for the most part, well-paced and kept my interest up as a good thriller should.I particularly enjoyed getting to know the characters, especially Kate, Angie, and Quinn. Even the smaller characters around the police station were interesting. (Interesting enough to make me seek out ""Dust to Dust"" to try and learn more about them!)My one complaint is that I sometimes found the characters hard to keep straight as many of them were referred to alternately by first name, last name, or nickname -- it took me stopping and checking to realize that Nikki, Liska, and Tinks were all the same woman!Still, I'd highly recommend this book. It's about as fun as reading the exploits of a serial killer can be, all things considered!"
3,Nothing Out of the Ordinary,"Deciding to take a break with some ""escapist"" fiction, I decided to read Ashes to Ashes based on my previous experience with the author's books. The story of a serial murderer and the hunt for the killer was interesting but written like hundreds of others. The main characters, Kate Conlan a victims advocate and John Quinn, an FBI profiler, were somewhat poorly fleshed out. I kept thinking that maybe they were featured in a previous book and this book was the second in a series. Other supporting characters, such as the various police detectives assigned to the case were more interesting. Overall, a quick read with a surprise ending (I must admit I had no idea who the killer was until the very end)."
3,REALLY SADISTIC AND GRUESOME,"I found myself cringing during the explicitely violent scenes. I didn't enjoy that aspect of it, I liked the suspense but felt the romance got in the way, but i guess i was just impatient. The romance did seem a pointless sideshow, it didn't really enhance the story, is there a romance in every Tami Hoag? i thought these were murder mysteries. the romance in Thin Dark Line was better though. This one is more suspenseful and more gory than TDL. Well-written."
2,An okay thriller. Not one of Tami Hoag's best.,"If I had it to do over again, I would have waited for the paperback! As a big fan of Tami Hoags most recent thrillers, I was excited about getting Ashes to Ashes. I like the way she intertwines mystery, murder and mayhem with romance. However, I do not feel the same about this one. I found the strong-willed, independent heroine to be pretty obnoxious at times. I also found the ""romance"" self-talk fairly juvenile. I became somewhat bored half-way through the novel and had trouble finishing it."
1,depressingly shallow,"First off, I haven't read so much unnecessary detail since that debacle of writing, Frazier's Cold Mountain. Hoag seems to want to throw everything in here she can think of.And then what does she think of? Mostly, anything that's mindless, shallow, callow. Yes, I read this thing for sheer entertainment. I wanted to ""waste"" a Saturday afternoon with a book, looking out at the snow in Manhattan. Instead, I was so irritated by the characters--just cliches masquerading as people--that I soon found myself skimming whole pages, muttering, ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.""And then comes the ending. I think if she tried to get more banalities into that final chapter, she couldn't have done it. I don't think I've ever seen so many little greeting card sentiments in so few pages. All this, and graphic violence too. Well, it did the trick. I wasted the afternoon. Just not enjoyably."
2,Disappointing!,"I have read other books by this author and loved them but was very disappointed this time. Couldn't get into the book--didn't even finish it. Not as captivating nor are the characters as 3-D as usual. I don't usually mind violence (Really liked Jeffrey Deaver's ""Bone Collector"") but this was too violent with little heart. Hope her next one is better."
4,"A bit predictable, but scared the pants off me anyway!","I slept with the light on a few nights while I was reading this book. I had never read anything by Tami Hoag before, but I definitely will again! While the plotline was a bit predictable (anyone with a good sleuthing mind will figure it out), the description and the style in which she writes is scary as hell!"
3,Not wild about serial killers,"I would like to read more of Tami Hoag's stories if they are not about serial killers or sex crimes. I don't like it when a book tries to get into the mind of a pervert. It might be more interesting if the book is based on a real story, but this is a novel. What I find interesting in a good mystery, is the way the main character finds clues and tracks down the culprit. It is also more enjoyable to me when a murder is committed for motives you can maybe guess yourself--like greed, love, etc. Sick, incestuous, cannibalistic and violent sex just isn't my cup of tea. Come to think of it, I wouldn't even want to read a book about someone real who is fits that description.I also thought this book dragged on way too long. I listened to the audio version, unabridged. It was about 16 hours. The narrator was pretty good. A bad narrator can ruin any story you are listening to."
3,Whew...,I listened to the 16 CD audio version. This book could have been 6 CD's shorter. A lot of dragged out conversations that had not much to do with the plot. Good plot and story otherwise.
1,It was terrible!,"I am sorry. You can tell me that this is only fiction, but who needs to read about such grusome acts. In today's society, they are sure to come true and I have no need to read about them. I will not read another Hoag book as long as she continues to write in this dark way. Go back to happy books!!"
1,Wish I could give it no stars...,"Yet another book in the long line of romance novelists who are trying to branch out - but still fail. I've read three or four Tami Hoag novels and they all amount to the same thing - a fractured novel that tries to be both romance and thriller but does not blend together in a cohesive unit. This one was the worst, mostly due to dialogue that is so cliched and stilted that the author should be embarassed. Ms. Hoag should select a genre and stick to it, either romance ot thriller."
3,Where's the cat?,"Ms. Hoag's writing is studious at best - smacking of a college trained writing background. She will never stack up against the Brits for suspense, having to use violent measures and human degradation to get reader attention. Only five of us missed the cat Thor, but to me the whole last quarter of the book left much to be desired in finalizing characters. Additionally, why do writers of this genre assume all police-persons have to make ""cop humor"" to get through their jobs? It is a device too often used and best left alone. I could not resolve Thor's disappearance after I finished this book and decided that he in his cat ""wisdom"" had decided to opt out of a rather plodding book, one which absolutely dissolved into ""get me out of this""."
3,Giovanni is OK - Good performer,"My opinion of Giovanni is that he is not as good as a performer a YANI is, but he does play very well.I just found him a bit on the boring side as regards his persona. Yani has a much better stage presence then Giovanni. Yani is active and gregarious and Giovanni seems too subdued~"
5,A pleasing collection,"Normally I don't like these little bits and pieces of things, but I was intent on getting George Gershwin's Lullaby, which I am very fond of. It happens that the rest of the collection is also well-chosen to my taste and gave me the opportunity to sample a couple of works which I was not familiar with and am now intersted in pursuing. The performers are of good quality as well, and the sound is good."
3,Spears and Awkward Hobos: secret review #4,"We didnt even know it was a song, a dvd, something to play in machines, the gears and plastic all remotely influenced, such oblong buttons. I was a cushion for such waves, a shore for baked items, so good and needed, such sales for the building fund. They are from Oklahoma City and I miss May avenue, the aged houses of heritage hills and somewhere off 15th street, amongst gargoyles and other creatures they made these songs.All angry and up to the slide they go, they go.more secret reviews go to secrettechnology (add the usual web ending withthe dot and all)Sebastian Bomar"
2,Sensible but dated,"Social science doesn't march ahead quite as some of the other sciences do, but it does advance. The result is that unless the author of an older work (Freud, for example) is an extraordinary genius, not much that's new or interesting is to be found there. This book was something excellent in its time, but now it's outmoded."
3,3.5 Stars,The Natural was the first Haystak album I purchased and is great music for anyone. White Boy is an original track and one of my favorite songs (and I'm Mexican!!!). The Natural is a MUST HAVE.
3,A Fitting Title,"A Natural is what Haystak is to rap, he really was born to do this. And he shows this on the album. This album was very different from his first 2 with this being his 3rd. It was more commercial and distributed by Kotch and I think his most advertised to date and maybe even his most famous because of this. But I can tell u it's not his best by a long shot it is goood though. Some tracks u should check out is Bangin, Cool People, Different Kinda Lady which is about his mom and 1 of his ol lady's. Dirty Dirty is another good 1 and the lyrics is him at his best.And lastly Life With No Crime will get u thinkin and because it does this it proves he's a great artist he can paint a picture with lyrics and it's almost like watchin a movie."
2,not so good,"the two stars r 4 billy. i live in canada and i can tell you that the show is one hour long. not the 30 min cut up hunk of scrap that is this disc. also, a laugh trax? for shame. for shame. good thing it's back on the air in canada."
3,Canadian Campy Comedy Classic,"Billy Van co-stars with Billy Van & Billy Van in ""The Hilarious House of Frightenstein"". The cult comedy series about a has-been vampire scientist who is trying to revive his monster ""Brucie"". Contains parodies of ""The French Chef"" (with Grizelda)and Wolfman Jack, (with a real wolfman DJ)Contains educational bits too with ""Dr. Pet Vet"" who brings live animals to the show. Also stars Vincent Price who recites ghoulish poems"
4,A great part of returned child memories....,"I do say that it is great that a show has been brought back to life (which most have forgotten). Anyways, its wonderful seeing the master of horror Vincent Price at his best and the great comedian acts of Billy Van (which were many) and crew. A great childeren's program for the young and old at heart."
2,hilarious house of frightenstien,"I am outraged, I live in Calif and they refuse to send it to me. I loved the show as a kid and now not even a tease this is discrimnation!!!!I would have give 4 stars but all you get is a 1. please send me dvd, pleas."
4,Picture Perfect,The ring was lovely and the opal was stunning. My only regret was it had the prongs and not bevelled.
5,Important book for all students of the Vatican,I approached this book with some scepticism(after all John Allen does write columns for the National Catholic Reporter) but I was truly surprised by how balanced John allen's analysis of how the vatican operates came out.This book is well balanced and has some great information for anyone trying to understand the inner workings of the vatican.Highly recommended and very well written. A little dated though.Very good read and full of great info.
4,how to elect a Pope,"A very good detailed account of how a Pope is elected, surpassed probably only by that of Lucien gregoire' Murder in the Vatican."
2,Riot Grrl gone bad to worse,"Bad and unoriginal, with very few exceptions. I liked it better when I first bought it back in '95. I took out this CD for a listen a few days back after leaving it for dust for so long and regretted my action. The drumming is sloppy and so are the guitars and all else. Sorry babes..."
1,Uh....okay,"What's up that girls voice? The ONLY normal song in this whole CD is the first one, ""Hello"". Geez!"
3,A good book for a true beginner,"This is not what I needed. The book is good for a true beginner with very limited to absolutely no prior fix-it type experience. I found the book a bit like reading a little red train book to help me prepare for a capstone thesis - it was a huge disappointment. Many words, very little said, addressed to the true novice. Thanks."
2,small effort for a big man,"The Big Bam starts with simply more questions than answers. Lots of sentences ended with question marks and references to ""fog"" whenever the facts are not clear to Montville. When the fog starts to lift, the book then gets boring. I can see that Montville is attempting to be accurate; however, in the process he creates an unenjoyable read. This is a shame as the subject matter is wonderful."
5,Big Bam is Big Hit,"The great Leigh Montville doesn't disappoint with his latest book, The Big Bam. The Babe Ruth biography is his best work yet. Montville takes readers back in time with colorful stories, news reports and polished prose that truly capture the life and times of Babe Ruth. The Big Bam reads like a Hollywood movie and much like Seabiscuit, is not just for the sports fans. Montville knocks it out of the park."
2,Too foggy!,"If you've never read anything about Babe Ruth before, this book is likely as good a place to start as any. If you know anything about Babe Ruth, this book leaves all the interesting questions unanswered. Every time the author can't find the information or is too lazy to dig it out, he claims there's a fog around Ruth's early life. Why was he placed in an orphanage? Who knows. What was his mother like? In the fog. Was she part African-American? Montville says the information's all gone. He uses the convenient concept of the fog to avoid digging deeply--and maybe working hard.There are plenty of other Ruth biographies around. This one's just too foggy."
2,Too Much Fog For My Taste.,"There's too much fog in this book. Whatever the author failed to research is hidden in fog.The assertion that Babe Ruth had attention deficit disorder is malarky. People with real ADD cant excel at something as complex as baseball. Armchair analysts always miss the point of psychiatric diagnoses, viz., diagnoses ALWAYS apply to folks with serious, debilitating symptoms NOT people with superficial behavioral similarities that are interesting or eccentric, but nowhere near the severity to create a handicap.There are better biographies of Babe Ruth than this one."
2,Solid but dull story of a great ballplayer,"Babe Ruth was renowned for his home run blasts, sadly this bio only rates as a weak single at best. Montville follows the same formula here that he did for his biography of Ted Williams. Where as Wiliams was a great ballplayer with no real success of the field, Ruth set the tone for the roaring 20's. While many of the Ruth stories are myth, Montville spends very little time telling us what was real and what wasn't. His fameous fueds are hardly mentioned, saved for the one with Lou Gerhig and that garners only slim mention. All in all this book is authorative but liking in the spice and character that made Babe Ruth who he was!"
1,Worst Biography I've never read,"I received this book as a birthday present and was really looking forward to reading it as I enjoy sports and biographies. But reading this book was agonizing. I got 40 pages into it and still couldn't tell you one thing about Babe Ruth. The writing was horrible and incomprehensible.I finally just gave up. Life is simply too short. If you are interested in purchasing or reading this book, try reading the beginning first. Maybe you'll save yourself money and grief.Can't wait to see how this author butchers Ted Williams biography."
3,BABE RUTH,THE BOOK WAS LISTED LIKE NEW BUT IT WAS NOT IN GOOD SHAPE. I BELIEVE SOMEONE LISTED IT IN THE WRONG CONDTION. iT WAS A GOOD READ.
4,An honest look at the Babe,"This was a no holds barred honest look at the life and times of the Babe, from his early life at an orphanage to his later years as a divorced man about town. If you are a baseball fan this is a must read. You'll be amazed at the stark contrast to the lives of modern day athletes and this sports legend."
5,One of a Kind,"I read this book in conjunction with Kostya Kennedy's ""56"". Although I am a fan of Montville's work, as a Red Sox fanatic I had avoided both works on principle alone. To my vast surprise, I enjoyed both of them immensely.The similarities are obvious since both books portray their iconic subjects in a historical perspective and deal frankly with their numerous personal shortcomings as well as the many flaws of the American society in which they moved.Montville is obviously the more hampered author since he has so few survivors who had personal contact with the Babe and therefore has to invoke the ""fog of time"" a bit too often. Nevertheless a clear picture of Ruth evolves and the reader is left with a good deal more insight into the cause of Babe's moral failures than he ever cared to consider himself.I would certainly recommend reading this book on a uniquely gifted athlete who, in this era of microscopic media scrutiny and political correctness, will never come our way again."
4,The Greatest Ballplayer Ever,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the last 100 pages. Maybe the historical information just ran out, but it seemed like the book was out of balance with 300 pages devoted to the Babe's first 32 years and the last 100 the rest of his life.In any case the book confirmed to me that the Babe, in spite of his homeric lifestyle, was simply the best ball player to ever put on a uniform. In my view nobody, today or then, could do what he could do.The author uses many sources to piece together the hisory of this man and the times. The writing is crisp and hold the reader's attention.All in all, a fine tribute to the Bambino."
4,Excellent read/Amazing character,"This was a well written, well researched book. Baba Ruth is a very interesting character. He led an amazing life, but it was both an ebulent and sad life at various points. I felt the book moved rapidly and didn't have many, if any, soft spots. Very good portrait of the Babe without being overly long. You do not have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this book (or so I think as I am one)"
5,My new favorite CD,"I bought this album a few weeks ago after hearing Calvin Gilmore sing How Amazing Grace Can Be on the Grand Ole Opry. The song stuck in my head and finally I looked him up on Amazon.com and he was there. I bought the CD and absolutely love it! Every song is so wholesome. If you're into the new ""bubble gum"" country, this CD probably isn't for you. It has a little more of the traditional country sound. He has a couple of cover songs on it too and gives Eddy Raven a run for his money on Island. I give this CD 2 thumbs up."
1,"Easy to use, but broke quickly","We were very excited to get the log splitter and found it easy to use, seemed to work well. But the weld on the bar between the V that does the splitting (and holding the V in place) quickly snapped. So we're Very disappointed by the quality of construction. If we got a replacement that didn't have the problem, we'd give it five stars."
2,Great idea...poor execution,"I got this splitter to help me split some hickory. About 1/4 cord in, the weld that holds the ram in place broke. Had to send it back. I'm giving two stars, because it worked well for the first few minutes, and I suspect that if I were splitting a softer hard wood (like cherry), it would done the job well."
1,why this is so awful,"I read these reviews and I wonder why peope cheapen all other of Dylans great works, as well as these songs, the blues, folk music and jazz, by saying nice things about this collection and ""good as i been to you."" The guitar playing is not good, the singing is awful and the songs, well the songs may be good sung by other artists. This is not the blues, not jazz and not good. I love early Dylan, middle Dylan and even late Dylan but not this and not ""good as i been to you."" If you have all the money in the world and all the space in the world to put another cd you will never listen to, then buy this, otherwise save your money and buy these songs by other better musicians and singers, or other better Dylan cds."
5,The Foundation for Dylan's resurgence,"Much has been made of Dylan's ""revival"" via TIME OUT OF MIND and LOVE AND THEFT. Those are great albums indeed. However, I doubt they would have come about if Dylan hadn't brought it all back home with this album and GOOD AS I BEEN TO YOU. Mike Gray has a great chapter in the third edition of SONG AND DANCE MAN about Dylan's affinity for the blues and how he has drawn from the blues for inspiration for many of his best works. People who don't like Dylan singing these songs are missing an important part of ther soul of Bob Dylan and the greatnes of his contribution to American music. Can you be a Dylan fan and not like this album? Of course. Can you fully appreciate Dylan's talent as a singer and songwriter without an appreciation for these performances? Probably not."
4,Dylan Being Dylan,"Dylan is as enigmatic as ever in this offering . He never ceases to surprise. Dylan Fans will like this CD, those unfamiliar with the Master,s works will probably hate it. I personally enjoyed it very much, but I,m a dyed in the wool DYLAN FAN!!!!!"
1,Not in stock.,"This seller continues to list this clamp, yet when you order, they do not have it in stock."
4,OK mount- a good value for the money,Good value mount-Ok for the money and an interim attachment for a tac light.Purchased as an interim to a fore-end light setupWorks as advertised andmuch better than the magazine mount versions
1,Fails to hold securely,"I bought this as an inexpensive light mount for my Mossberg 500A Persuader 8 shot, but unfortunately it fails to hold the light securely. After firing only a few rounds (birdshot and slugs, maybe 7 rounds total), the light had slipped forward and scratched my magazine tube. I tightened it down HARD and tried again, with the same results. It never completely slipped off, but looked like it was going to with a few more rounds. Locktite or something similar probably would help this and might even fix it, but this is unworkable since you need to remove the forend for appropriate cleaning. All in all, it seemed like a good idea, but turned out to be unworkable. This is the first review I've ever done, so I feel strongly about it!"
1,Shallow and Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this book, to which it didn't live up. I presumed, incorrectly, that Mr. Shenkman had specific experience as an attorney practicing in this area. My impression is that his writings on asset protection appear to be just a summarization of the writings of others, with little or no original thought. About halfway through this book, puzzled by its consistent shallowness, I finally did some research on Mr. Shenkman and found out that he seemingly just quickly cranks out a new book every time some topic heats up, such as his ""How to Buy a House with No (or Little) Money Down""."
3,Cherry Wood Suit Hangers,"I purchased 12 cherry wood suit hangers through Amazon. They look nice, but 3 out of the 12 were received cracked/broken. The cracks appear to be a manufacturing defect/quailty issue rather than damage caused during shipment."
4,Works well keepingall in-tact*,I thought it worked well and the case & extra fin key was a bonus. Have used your products on other boards in the past as well; Mahalos'.
5,Great Buy!,"Awesome collection!! Includes Dora, Diego, WonderPets, Blues Clues, Yo Gabba Gabba and Kai Lan, loves all of these characters as does my toddler. All her favorite shows without the toy commercials!"
5,Nickelodeon Favorites: Big Box of Play Dates 2,"My 3 year old boy loves nick junior, hence got him this set of dvd. it's very entertaining, able to keep him occupied for quite a while."
4,Uplifting Reading,"WOW Yvonne! Thanks for this book. This book is packed full of short meaningful, uplifting and useful gems to help the reader view the lighter side of life while learning important lessons of life. This book is cleverly written with effective illustrations to assist the writer in making her points. I highly recommend this book to the potential buyer who wishes to read daily positive thoughts and develop a happy meaningful relationship with other people. It was well worth the little money I spent for it."
2,Mostly an order of battle list,"Not quite the book I thought it would be. The descriptions of the battles are mostly a order of battle (units involved etc.). Although very complete in that way and probably more accurate than many accounts, it does not make for very good reading. There are some insights as far as claims on both sides and what units were involved, but no first person stories and little overall evaluation and conclusion. Description of aircraft is also pretty light, and does not include pictures or drawings of all aircraft (would be useful for some of the more uncommon aircraft).If you are interested in units involved and numbers etc., I would suggest this book. If you want interesting stories and reading or want some evaluation and insight (other than numbers) on the subject I would not suggest this book."
2,Boring and superficial.,"Based on the radio interview with Roselli that aired on WNYC in New York, I'm sure it would be possible to write an interesting biography of this apparently underappreciated singer. However, this book isn't it. Evanier appears to see Roselli as a sort of tragic figure whose personality flaws undermined his potential for a success even greater than the not-inconsiderable fame he has actually enjoyed. However, the reliance on anecdotes from a few friends and associates who are quoted over and over gives the book a repetitious character that left me bored after the first 100 pages. Somehow the story of a guy who scoffed at the instant fame offered by Ed Sullivan and Johnny Carson because they would not pay his usual fee just doesn't seem very tragic, or very interesting. To find a sympathetic character here, instead of a self-involved jerk who brought about his own problems, I needed more help from the author (and the editor)."
2,Old time country only....every song sounds the same!!,"every song sounds the same!!I was hoping for more of the sound in her singing (Ballads) as in ""Brokeback Mountain"""
4,Great Book,"Going into professional catering and design, I am always on the prowl for really great books under that catogory. This book has a lot of really great ideas that will make holidays very special. The best part about it though, would have to be that the ideas are not at all complicated, in fact just about anyone can make a holiday great by following these ideas!"
1,I am amazed.,"How can people like this book. [...] Anyway, the lessons in this book make me sick. They make me feel like I am doing school work and don't tell you how this type of question will appear on the sat. The practice is the worst I have ever seen. I am not exagerating, I mean it!!! The math is interestingly hard, not because is tests the hard type of questions, but because it test questions that don't appear on the real test. Their math sections also have 20 grid-ins. The critical reading is just plain wierd and the writing is way to easy and contains to little questions. Ugh!!! The college hill method is supposed to get you the right answer. However, one of the steps is to think logically or, rephrasing it, use your reasoning skills. Great. They don't teach you how to develope those skills and have no examples using this method. The practice is a waste of time and some of the lessons did more harm than good. I get stressed out every time I think of this book. I TRUELY hate this book!"
4,EXCELLENT FOR LONG TERM SKILL BUILDING,"This one stands apart from the other books I've looked at. Rather than test prep per se, it attempts to provide a foundation of the basic skills the SAT tests. It does so very well. But this method is a long term process. If the test is coming soon, this may not be the right book. But if you are at least 6 months from the test, it has an added benefit. Unlike typical prep books, this one provides skills that will stay with you. If you are going to spend all this time studying for the SAT, why see it become irrelevant after the SAT? This gives you lessons that will last."
3,$19.79 as in circa 1979?,These are lower in price because they are missing the hideous moc croc detail on the heel. These are cute cheap shoes that look like Disney princess shoes so I ordered them when they were $39 in limited sizes as a Friday Sale deal. They fit narrower than what I usually wear. They make your feet look smaller and your ankles slimmer so I recommend them but I suggest ordering them in the wider width if you don't have slim feet because Amazon will not do an exchange and you will lose out on shipping.Customers for other Naturalizer models also have the same complaint about a too narrow toe area. It's not wearable that way. Proper fit is a nonnegotiable issue when it comes to shoes.
3,Okay for Filing and Shaping Short Nails,File is sort of thick and did not work well until I cut my nails down to finger tip level.
5,A Must-Read for any woman associated with a manopausal man!,"I read it once. I read it twice. And then, just to make sure I'd consumed every morsel of humor contained within its pages, I read it again. Food for thought? Most assuredly, and the author delivers this meal with a style of humor that forces you to stop reading, stop thinking, stop the world (!), and hang on to your belly until you can stop laughing. Mr. Poncy's talents are not limited to communication via the written word, however. He provides the reader with an assortment of primitive illustrations that would make a first grade art teacher cringe and question his or her calling. Yet these mini-masterpieces bring home the message as eloquently as the most exquisite Renoir. Manopause by Mark Poncy is enlightening, entertaining, and just plain fun. God willin' and the creek don't rise, we'll be hearing lots more from this new author in years to come."

4,Excellent Guide to Transitioning to Purpose Driven,"Our church is an established congregation over 200 years old that is transitioning toward a ""Purpose Driven"" ministry focus. This book was just what we needed to guide us through the process. We are well on our way and are following the 8 steps laid out in the book. I highly recommend it."
5,Transferable Principles for Businesses & Churches,"This is a very important read for any leader that wants to successfully move his organization from where they are, to where they need to be. From Vision to implementation, the entire cyclical process is clearly illustrated with numerous real-life examples...Many well-intended leaders of change have failed because they did not understand the preparation and pre-work that is need to successfully transition an established organization... applicable for either the church or business environments... This book provides a great roadmap for both!!"
1,Hideous. Pure rubbish.,"Southerland drove out the original congregation of three hundred, kept their property and facilities, changed their church into his creation, filled it with neophytes, and became their king. This book is a near perfect expose of the methods of the utterly corrupt Church Growth Movement. There are three ways to deal with an errant preacher like Southerland; get them on board, fight them, or run them off (Transitioning - p 71). They are truly ""leaders from Hell"" (Transitioning - p 115)"
2,Steps to Contemporary Worship,"This is a ""how to"" book for church leaders intent on becoming a Contemporary Church. From a Fundamentalist perspective, it is a means of changing the message and method of local church ministry so as to become more attractive to people by using marketing techniques more appropriate for the supermarket. If you want to build a ministry that is short on message and long on appeal to worldly people, then this is the book for you. If you care about the message that people really need to hear, more than appeasing their status quo, this book will serve as a warning of what not to allow in your church under any guise."
3,bubbles,This was made of nice heavy glass...felt great in the hand however there were bubbles in both the pitcher and sugar bowl... that bummed me out since I was planning on using them with my good china. Not bad to keep for yourself but I wouldn't use these to serve to guests.
1,deceptive title,"Totally 80's sounds like a lot of videos from the 80's, not true is just 6 videos. Reading the description on the item when I bought it was kept a secret how many videos were on the dvd."
1,Buyers Beware! DON'T BUY ANYTHING COBY,"I got this in Oct, in less than 10 minutes, it died. I called Coby, they said ship it back, they would inspect it and replace or repair it. The process would take about 3-4 weeks. 8 weeks later, they now say it is backordered 2 more weeks. When asked about a refund, they said it would take 6-8 weeks! Get something from a company that stands behind their product. Coby obviously doesn't care about quality or customer service by their actions.UPDATED REVIEW:THREE months have gone by, no replacement, no refund, no calls being returned. If I could rate them a ZERO, I would! Don't buy a Coby product, you will be VERY SORRY that you did!"
3,It has a nice picture,"I bought this TV to have in an earthquake emergency as I live in California. Well, this past weekend we had a minor hurricane and lost power for 36 hours. This provided the test time. I installed all the ""AA"" batteries required and went through the programming process and only really was able to receive one channel. I then installed a splitter on my PC modem and connected it to the TV, reprogrammed it and was able to get an abundance of channels. The picture was beautiful! It took some doing but it leaves something to be desired with being truly portable."
4,road warriors friend,"Pretty darn light. Keyboard takes a little getting used to. Screen/keyboard has very tight fit. Suggest a plastic cover for screen to keep oils from hands/keyboard off the screen.Don't waste money on the Sony privacy filter. Screen size takes a little getting used to. Two memory slots, but one is built in on motherboard allowing only one slot for expansion. If you are going to travel. Buy it."
3,New tag comin out,there actually is a new one of the legand team which I bought for $20 but it's worth it! I say there's a nice education to this toy becuse youl learn spanish...HA!
1,Dreadful,Author would have done better to write more about her pig and less of herself. Probably the most narcissistic book I've ever read. Perhaps it's a sign of the times. The book made far too many references to all her other books and those of her husband's as well. Almost like commercials. UG!
3,"Enjoyable, but....","Wonderful story -- but it goes on a bit long, and wanders into some odd pieces from time to time. Vocabulary and editing are not first rate (how many times can she talk about ""blue eyes""??"
4,Charismatic Christopher,"What a delightful book! I do so wish I could have met Christopher - he really was an excellent pig. Sy Montgomery's life sounds so interesting, and she writes in a very easy, readable way. I have recommended this book to several people, as well as buying a couple of copies as gifts."
5,One of my favorite books ever!,"From the very beginning, I fell in love not only with Christopher Hogwood, the author's pet pig, but with Sy Montgomery herself. Her tender, powerful and sometimes hilarious accounts of Christopher Hogwood's life and adventures lets us experience vicariously a very special relationship with a very special pig. Sy Montgomery captures the impact that sharing our lives with animals can have on all of us. This book is about relationships - animal and human - as Sy so lovingly records the impact her extroidinary pig had on an entire community. This is a book I will read over and over again."
5,Wrought Iron Amish Lamp,I would definately buy fron this customer again. They were prompt on shipping the item and delivering the item . The lamp was of a good quality. I would recommend this dealer to anyone!
1,NEED TO SAY THERE IS NO LAMP SHADE WITH THIS,NEED TO SAY THERE IS NO LAMP SHADE WITH THISDID NOT FIND ANYWHERE THAT THERE IS NO SHADETHAT SUCKSRICK
4,Great MET review,"I got both volumes. I took MET from an osteopath,Dr. Richard MacDonald, in the mid 80s. These DVDs are a great review.They really do make the subject easier to learn by providing excellent visual aids and going thru the tecniques step by step. If you like MET these dvds are a must. The 4 on the floor concept re occiput/C1 Dx is sweet."
4,Hippy Power Lifting,"This is a hard book to review. I bought my copy at a used bookstore back in the mid 90's. I go back and read through it every once in a while to just remind myself that there are other ways of meditation other than sitting quietly pondering the depths of one's belly button. I think the first words on the back say much more about the writing style than I can. ""I was born on a stormy night. I am sure I was born without a name, but they soon called me Tom."". Yep, that sums it up.Oh, and it has some old school free weight lifting techniques that I had never seen before."
1,"Help, where is the editor?????",I am not in the habit of bashing a book but I think my disappointment was so great that I just have to write this. I read the first page and then had it downloaded to my kindle. I love mysteries and I love Russian History. How sad this book turned out. Some of the sentence structure was so poor that I wondered where his editor was.I love hearing about the local color because I was there but he tried to bring in too much local color too fast. Why not let it unfold in a natural manner with the story. I have returned this book. Sorry I didn't get the read I was looking forward too.
4,Incredible setting for a novel,"This novel White Russian takes place in one of the most interesting and tragic times in world history, the Russian Revolution of 1917. Of course we have the benefit of knowledge of Russian history to be familiar with the subsequent events within 12 months of this stories time frame. What I loved with this novel is the tension created amongst the characters and the concern, fear and apprehension of events beyond their control.The corruption and struggles of the royalist system and the horrors of the war are all part of this story about a series of murders and the police inspector who set out to solve the crime.The only reason I gave this novel 4 stars was the ending of the story was a bit weak in my opinion and not in keeping with the character's personalities."
2,Sacred Ground,"I realize I'm treading on sacred ground here, but I couldn't get beyond the first half of the first volume of this novel. Henry James is an eloquent wordsmith but he writes as though writing is an end in itself. Where is the story here? Nothing ever happens. Characters talk for the sake of talking, around and around and around the subject without ever getting to the point. They never really act, they just talk about acting: how, given a particular set of circumstances and inferred assumptions, one might, if one were of a mind to at some future date, consider the possibility of determining a course of action. In his preface to the 'New York Edition', James describes the best scene in the book as one of Isabelle sitting motionless in a chair. If this is your idea of a good time, have at it!"
1,This looked like a home printout.,The story is marvelous. I was just disappointed in the physical book itself and I certainly wouldn't recommend that anyone buy it.
5,Portrait of a Lady,Sustained brilliance interrupted by passages of genius. I don't need thirtenn more words to review this book. So this is filler.
2,Never gets better,"This series had so much potential, but never quite made it. You go through years of this woman's life waiting for things to get better for her, and they never do, despite the fact that over and over again loving friends and family keep warning her and giving her ways out of her situations. Instead you're dragged through her drama, with no reason to even care if things get better for her as she keeps making safe, but dumb and boring decisions, sinking further and further into quiet misery. I wish someone had told me this before, so I wouldn't have wasted my time going through the whole series."
3,WARNING- this is NOT a traditional paperback,"Buyers beware- for e-readers, this may be a good option.But, if you're going for the paperback, be warned: it is NOT a normal paperback.It is a chintzy, strangely typeset, incomplete version of Henry James's book. It is the size (height by width) of a school textbook or workbook, which makes it very inconvenient for reading in any other position than sitting at a table.For those who want a paperback, I'd recommend another edition (maybe the Penguin one, for instance) which will: 1. Contain the entire book; 2. Be of higher quality; 3. Fit in your hand; 4. Cost less (for the entire book than for this single volume of it).I'm not sure what the target audience is for this kind of paperback volume, besides people like me who just got confused on Amazon."
5,Grandma Mac,"This was for my 3year old granddaughter for her birthday along with a doll house and furniture. We waited to give the doll house last because it was put together by Grandma.She opened the family and sat them on the table , then she opened the furniture same thing, no comment, then when she opened the doll house she put furniture and baby brother in bed and put herself in kitchen I think Dad ended up in bath tub,she walked Mom around the house talking to her.No question they were a hit and even two weeks later still being played with everyday, her younger brother put the family in his trucks and cars.So I purchased the modern family this week. I would recommend these toys because of safety features. I have already ordered more items.Thank you so much,Grandma Mac"
4,Awesome dolls!!,"It is a very nice dollhouse family. The one problem is that the mother and father's pants and skirt keep falling down. There is only one small block of wood for their body, so that could be the problem with there pants/skirt are falling down. However, I love to play with my dolls. I enjoy them very much, and if you are looking for dolls I would suggest you get them. :-)"
5,"Cute, durable, inexpensive","Good quality, cute, sturdy for a low price. I got 2 families to fill up all the beds, bunk beds, etc that I made."
3,They are OK,They are a little larger than I had hoped. but they will do. It is hard to find people small enough to fit the little dollhouse furniture I had when I was a child
1,It is great if you are not allergic,"After a great deal of research, I decided to buy this set doll for my daughter. She is 2 and half and she enjoyed the dolls for 1 day. Then I noticed my skin felt itchy and my lung hurt! When I checked the dolls, their legs and arms are made of some sort of electrician's wire that was covered with woven fibers and I know a lot people are allergic to this kind of fiber. I wish I have time to provide a photo. Long story short, a couple of days later, she had bad post-nasal drip that made her almost sleepless for two days and needed a doctor visit and prescription medication.She still loves them very much and begged me not to trow them away. Now she realized she cann't even sit near them because her throat will hurt. So she allowed me to put them in a zip-loc waiting for a solution.If there is no allergy, I will give the toy set 5 stars."
3,Exceedingly well made but lacking - though not made in China,"We purchased these for the Victorian Doll House, also from Plan Toys. As in the rest of this company's line, the materials are made from replenishable rubber tree wood and colored with non-toxic vegetable dye. That said, the family figures are a bit on the dull side, the father looks like he wears a bad toupee, the clothes are affixed to the bodies, and if they were taken off you'd be confronted with an armature of wood and resin-coated braided steel.On the other hand, they are super durable, withstanding wild raging tantrums and the crunching heft of a mother-in-law's clawed foot. They also stand upright quite well."
4,My 2 yr old loves it,"We have the doll house and some furniture and the addition of the family was a great thing. My 2 yr old daughter and 4 yr old son, keep rearranging the dolls in different positions onto the chairs and into the beds. It looks like a toy that will last a lifetime - wood and durable fabrics versus plastic."
5,Couldn't put it down,"After reading a couple other sewing books and getting nowhere in my quest to teach myself to sew, this book answered all the questions I had as a beginner. I literally couldn't put it down because suddenly all the sewing, fabric and pattern jargon that had been rolling around in my brain suddenly made sense. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning reading it from cover to cover."
3,not for beginners!,"When I got my first sewing machine, I bought this book and the Complete Book of Sewing to help me learn how to sew. Naturally, every time I begin a new project, I consult one book and then the other hoping that what one doesn't teach me the other will. I always end up on the internet trying to figure out sewing terms I don't understand, and confusing pictures that don't fully explain to me what to do.These books probably make sense to people who have had a bit of experience sewing, but being completely green at sewing I have found more help in reading the instruction manual for my sewing machine and searching on the internet than in these two books."
3,It's good for beginners,"Buy this book if you are beginner at sewing, and ONLY if you are interested in sewing clothing. Good self-teaching aide. I just expected more information on other than sewing basics, and was disapponted."
4,Awesome book!,"This is a great sewing book with lots of info in ""easy to read"" (and understand) form. I bought it with hopes of finding more info on the accessories for sewing machines and their detail uses. I found some of that in here but a lot more helpful sewing technique information. I gave the book a 4 because it is mostly about sewing clothes and I sew everything but clothes. The techniques are helpful though."
5,Great resource,"I was pleased to see that this is still the ""best sewing book. I use mine all the time and have been sewing for 30 plus years. I purchased this copy for my DDIL, who has just gotten her first sewing machine."
3,Use with Prudence,"No book on the how-to of sewing will make anyone a sewer. Still, this work is one one to have perched close to the sewing machine. That is, it's a good reference work for the active seamtress who has questions on technique.Half-way through the book is some glossy photography displaying the end results of ""patternless sewing"" -- kiminos, skirts, sleveless tops, ponchos, and tote bags. Ideally, as Ms. Soto states, these projects, and their detailed instructions, are for those polishing rusting sewing skills. Indeed, it would be a daunting task, for any sewer to do the measuring and cutting directly on the fabric. For anyone trying this patternless sewing, take the time to make a paper pattern from the measurements presented in the book!"
1,Arrived Damaged,Arrived in non-padded box and damaged as a result. Refund provided but a hassle anyway. Need to improve padding prior to shipping.
3,Adequate,"The product's size was as advertised, however it was noticeably thinner than the original filter that was included with my Hunter 30546 air purifier. Also the ""Product Features"" area advertises this an an ""activated carbon"" filter, but there is no mention on the box or on the [...] website saying that the product is indeed made of ""activated carbon."""
2,no activated carbon in these filters!,"These are NOT tivated carbon filters, which shed carbon particles, and these mis-named and not suitable for a HEPA air filter; Amazon/Bultk Filters continues to send this bagged version, not the original Hunter boxed filters, and I won't get ever purchase these from Amazon/Bulk Filters again."
4,works fine,This works fine. I have replaced the old one and like it. Helps with the air purifier and I change it when I change the regular filter.
4,Great filter!,"The Hunter air purifier works really well, and this filter does too. I actually vacuum it out weekly because I live in a very dusty area, and I still only really need to change it every 2-3 months. It really helps my allergies!"
5,Hunter Air Cleaner Carbon Replacement Pre-Filter,Item comes in a sheet. Need to trim to fit which is fine with me.
1,Bad for Doggies,"After I had purchased these, I researched them a little and I found the company that makes them also makes an entire line of plastic things, such as mouth guards. These are said to be very bad for dogs even though they look cute, which is why I bought them."
2,weird size bushings required,these require special size bushings not standard stuff & thur hard to find & ranchos service sux i'd recomend gettin another brand
3,Quilting,"Book is smaller than original one and the print is very small. Other than that, the book has a lot of great ideas."
3,good but....,"after a month or so the cord started to separate from the tip it still works just shoddy manufacturing I guess,sound is good though just can't help feeling like its too expensive when you can get a similar cord for a lot less"
2,works for about 6 months,high quality sound. worked well for about 6 months then started to come apart at each end which causes it to lose pwer and cut out in the middle of songs. very annoyed. would not buy again.
2,Aggravating read,Branda Joyce has written a few gems. This book however; is NOT one of them. The heroine is perhaps the most nerve wracking neurotic romantic character I have ever come across. Even in moments of kindness she is constantly sniping at the hero. I got so impatient with the book that I flung it across the room. good riddance!
3,Firestorm in San Francisco,"Didn't like the fact that the main character is 17 years old. Lots of steamy pages, some action, a bit drawn out at the end but again, as a Brenda Joyce fan, I enjoyed the book although it was not one of my favorites.Set in San Francisco, it was a different look at a city many of us are familiar with ~ common references to streets that I have spent time on. Fun to read, page turner, easy read - Firestorm is a book that isn't the traditional historical romance set back east or in England. Brenda Joyce created a spirited, YOUNG, main character with spunk. Her main man is handsome, desired by all, and.... wealthy, of coarse.... Firestorm is similar to her other story lines. BUT ~ Please, Brenda, make your characters a bit older in age, like at least 4 years older.......Read on my Kindle"
3,quite disturbing!,"I think this novel felt more like an account of the hero's sexual escapades, and it was pretty disturbing reading about the various dalliances the hero had with all his mistresses.the worst part of the book was the hero being seduced by his own aunt at the age of 15, and it was reallly disturbing to read that he almost fell into bed with her daughter!!(his cousin sister)between so many ladies, the chemistry between brett(the hero) and storm(the heroine) never really excites you, though Storm's character was stronger than what you generally find in romance novels."
2,Mediocre,"I was disappointed! I was excited to discover that the heroine's family were related to charcters in a later book written by Joyce, but I was very disgruntled with the hero's family and their lust for each other. This family possessed no code of ethics, no morals and definitely not an ounce of love for one another. Sickening to say the least!"
4,PREVIN A LA SMOOTH,"Andre Previn has always been a unique figure in the music world. A classical conductor (The San Francisco Symphony, as an example) and an accomplished jazz pianist puts him in a rare league of players. This album is a compilation of 3 LPs recorded in the early sixties. The first 9 selections had strings and unlike the musak that this could have become, the solos of Previn are tasteful and to the point. The next 2 selections are a quintet session of Kurt Weill tunes. JJ Johnson on trombone is wonderful and stands out. Then back to the strings; but this time the strings sound more percussive and moody; almost like minature film scores that Previn feels at home with. The album ends with another purely jazz small ensemble. An album like this would have never flown today; but the taste and class of Previn and his cohorts could make it so once again."
1,Useless,"You can't ""teach yourself"" Chinese from this book, which has no audio. The operative word is ""yourself"". It could work as a textbook because in that scenario you have a teacher= no one is ""teaching themselves"" from this book alone. But then you would have a real textbook and learn properly over time. I am sorry to use this tone but I am reacting to having bought it while trying to learn without a teacher and find it a waste of money compared to other purchases."
5,Perfect for Air Travel,"I bought this book to have crosswords to work whilst traveling. I didn't want anything that was too hard, but not too easy either. These fit the bill and the price is right."
1,Waste of money,This crossword book is WAY overpriced. I only bought it to meet the free shipping purchase amount on another item. I really consider it packing material.
3,This Is OK But...,"My 3 year old granddaughter received this for her birthday from her aunt.Consists of a pink plastic CD player(with pics of the Disney Princesses on the lid)three tiny CD,s and carrying strap.It also has flashing lights,an on/off button and forward/reverse button.However,the CD,s are just music,no words.The music is not the greatest and can grate on an adult's nerves after awhile.There is no volume button(think LOUD)and you cannot play any other CD,s on it which is why I gave it only three stars.But it was one of Kiersten's favorite presents."
3,Okay,"My daughter got this for Christmas and we were immediately dismayed to discover that the volume adjustment is... a sticker. Yep, there is a sticker that says ""volume"" and it shows the appropriate markings for turning it up or down, but there is no way to adjust the volume. The volume is pretty loud too. Annoying.However, she loves the thing and we like it because there is no problems with CD's getting scratched since they are just plastic disks that snap in (they don't even spin). It would have been nice if there was a spot to store the extra disks."
1,This toy is a waste of your money!!!,"Purchased this for our princess obsessed daughter for her 3rd b-day. This child walks around the house singing from the minute she wakes up until she goes to bed. Thought we had gotten the perfect present. This toy sucks! Saw it at Target and bought it - should have researched it first. The songs have no lyrics and they sound like they are stuck on fast forward and there is no volume control. Three year olds need the words!!! Thought the packaging was really mis-leading - says ""songs"" and there is what looked like a volume control button on the front of the player - it's really just a sticker. This thing got on our nerves in about 5mins - she was playing it in her room and I could hear it downstairs in the kitchen and it was still loud. It is going to ""disappear"" - will be replacing it asap with something better. Don't waste your money!!"
5,The one to get!,"If you are even remotely curious about Beverly Kenney, this is the album to get! The essence of Kenney is most brilliantly captured on this set of 12 songs including ""It's Magic"", ""Do It Again"", ""Try a Little Tenderness"" and ""It's a Most Unusual Day"". Kenney's breathy voice is supported by Ellis Larkins' inspired accompaniment. This is truly a beautiful album you will play frequently."
5,Great singer,"I love this underappreciated and nearly forgotten jazz oriented vocalist of the late 50's. She made, I believe, 6 LP's. They are all fine, unfortunate that none of them are available as CD's in United States. The album covers do not show what she looked like. Innocent, sophisticated, she phrased softly in a uniquely thrilling manner. Too her own life at age 28.Was a weekend disc jockey in the 60's and would play her records. The phone would ring every time - ""Who is that woman."" ""Beverly Kenny. She's gone,"" I'd say."
1,terrible singing,"No matter how many times I listen to this LP, I just can't warm up to her singing. She sounds like a typical 1950s pop singer. Her singing is marked with the irritating mannerism of bending notes without any consideration to the lyrics, harmonic structure or rhythm of the music. I suppose Beverly equates this to jazz improvisation. Beverly's supposed ""jazz singing"" is analogous to letting a 5 year old child drive in a busy freeway...the result a WRECK!!! Avoid this album if you want to hear jazz."
2,"Overpriced,poorly done. A shame,really","The New York Mets of 1969 are forever etched into images of sun dappled youth. I cam to baseball through the mets, and 1969 was just that special year, like falling in love the first time. So for mets fans[who have had far more to moan than cheer] this team is emblamtic of all that was, and was good. this book,which I frevently wished was good, is not. The sports writing form that era in the NY daily news{from whose morgue these writings and mostly photos are culled]was not bad,though not nearly enough is presented. No Boxscores, very little on what was going on around the city[which,after all, was one of things that made the mets so much fun]and alot of skimming. For $30, the publishers could have done much,much more. The portraits of some mets done by Bruce Stark,and the wonderful Bill Gallo cartoons almost make up for the disappoinment.I left wanting more,much more."
5,Outstanding!,"A magnificent collection by an American Master. A powerful, moving, exhiliarating work! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Not too exciting,"I ordered this hoping for some new ideas of make ahead or easy grill entrees that can be transported to a picnic and gotten ready with no electricity. OK, for me the drinks and desserts section was not a big draw. I can figure out a pitcher of something and a tupperware of brownies on my own. But creative appetizers, salads, and entrees that taste good at room temperature or can be easily heated up on a grill. That's what I wanted. The salads and appetizers were okay, but the entrees were almost all sandwiches! There were only five entrees that were not some kind of sandwich. And two were baked chicken. Not exactly innovative picnic ideas. Also no table of contents, just an index that does not break it down by course. Pretty pictures but it is going on a shelf."
5,Wonderful,"Just listen to ""Philadelphia"" by Neil Young. A sad reflective masterpiece.Still cry when I listen to it."
3,It left out a lot,"This soundtrack had only one major flaw. Two of the best, most moving songs of the movie were left out entirely. ""All The Way"", sung by Gary Goetzman, ""It's In Your Eyes"", sung by Paulette Washington, and in my opinion, especially ""Heaven"" as performed by Q Lazzarus.If they had wished to make a soundtrack, they should have included ALL the songs in their entirety on the soundtrack."
3,Songs Of Philadelphia.,"Though this soundtrack is over 10 years old now, I still play it relatively often. Mostly because it's just a great collection of artists and songs. The ""Bruce Springsteen"" track was the most popular, but the songs from ""Peter Gabriel"", ""Indigo Girls"", and ""Sade"" are all great too. However, the best, and most moving track is from ""Neil Young"". For his song alone I could never get rid of this disc, it's so beautiful. Overall ""Philadelphia"" is a good listen all the way through, whether you know the movie or not."
5,Good variety,"This soundtrack album has a very eclectic variety of music. From rock, ballads, classical and score music it is bound to please. Well, not everyone of course, but those people who enjoy a good mix. I have never seen the movie so cannot comment on how it fares to the movie. But I do know that every song on here is a good one. The two songs that stand out for me though, are the Bruce Springsteen song ""Streets of Philadelphia"" and Sade's cover of ""Please send me someone to love""."
2,Omits,"Philadelphia was a great movie. Philadelphia was a great movie with a marvelous musical soundtrack. Except...like so many other movie soundtracks with marvelous music, Philadelphia followed in the footsteps of other disappointing soundtracks. A very good track that was included in the movie was left from the soundtrack. ""Heaven"" performed in the movie for the movie by Q. Lazzarus does not appear on any version of the soundtracks for this movie. Why not? Is it because David Byrne or Q. Lazzarus would not give their permission? Makes no sense. It does not appear on vinyl, CD or cassette, yet, it was a good addition for the movie. It is difficult not to give up on soundtracks; so many include very nice music that seldom becomes available by an artist elsewhere. I've found that when soundtrack versions of music are not included, they are sometimes not released anywhere else. If not for the preceding, I would have rated this soundtrack higher."
5,Love it,Love the movie and love all the songs involved. The price is super great compared to Walmart or target. Would recommend. Great buy!!
4,Movie track,I only liked five of the songs.But I play them when I write because it helps me create. I liked the movie too.
5,Happy Reader in Spring Hill,"We have ordered several books via Amazon.com. Some I've bought new and some used. I have always been really, really pleased with the items I've ordered. Even the ""used"" books were in excellent condition and well worth ordering. Thanks Amazon.Com - keep up the good work."
3,Good Playing but Not My Thing,Like the album overall but truthfully irish traditional is not my thing andafter a while this all starts to sound the same. Brian Conway is very gifted and can play at warp speed and if you're into this type of music you will be very happy with this album. I think I'll save my money next time.
4,Alienware Deluxe Backpack (Mibile Edge),"Second one I've purchased the price was definitely better this time around. I have no problems with them, they are well constructed and have a lot of features. From what I understand Mobile Edge is a good company.The cons I think I have deal with the 4 external side pockets. They look like they were designed for a mouse, great any one of them would have fit it fine. . . Now what do I do with the other three??My use is kind of dual purpose. I have a laptop as my primary computer at work and this bag works great for that. I also ride street bikes and this thing has pads in the back that help it fit back contours. It also has a waist strap and a chest strap so it fits snug at high speeds."
5,Bag for on the go!,"I purchased this bag because of the size and because of the 17"" laptop holding area. I was extremely pleased with the amount that you can carry in this bag. It is very good quality. My one disappointment was that the straps when tightened have excess straps flapping around (just like every other bag). Its no big deal, just that i have to tuck them when I'm on my motorcycle. Overall, the bag is well worth the money and I highly recommend giving it a shot."
4,Great Bag,"I bought this bag cause I needed a school bag that would be able to carry my laptop. I love the paded pocket in the back of the main compartment, it holds my laptop well. The main compartment is a little small, but doable. It gets a little tight when I have all my books in there plus my laptop. I love all the little pockets, yeah they all seem to be shaped to hold a mouse, but I use them for holding all kinds of things you just have to be creative. The straps are very comfortable and secure they're great. Overall it is a great bag, very durable and great for what I need."
1,Watch out how the bill you!,"Not enough content for on online versions!Not credible on their subscription practice. Increase the rate, or reduce you subscription periods during a paid subscription terms."
2,Simply not enough content,"For $72/year, this just doesn't have enough content compared to the print and website editions of the newspaper. Sure it's convenient, but it just doesn't feel ""meaty"" enough as a daily newspaper in this format to seem worthwhile. Also, the UI is bit strange at first until you figure it out -- left/right for within an article, up/down to hop from article to article.Given it's been several years since the Kindle-edition of this paper was made available, it's clear they are not dedicating many resources to making it better."
1,Poor Product,This is a poor product. Articles are consistently in the wrong section. I read mostly Sports and need to search the entire document to find the Sports articles. Content is limited. No pictures. The San Francisco Chronicle is a much better product. I cancelled my subscription and recommend against buying this product.
3,Pretty good for a Kindle version of the local newspaper,"I get the SJ Merc paper edition and this Kindle version does a pretty good job of covering *most* articles in the paper edition, but not all.The Mercury is not a great newspaper and often I feel it's a bit too politically and commercially biased, but it does provide a Silicon Valley context when I'm on the road.Overall, I think the $6/month is worth the price."
3,Getting better,They're getting the interface hammered out so it's easier to read. Articles are a bit weak but that's always been a problem with the Merc. Good local coverage for city politics.
2,Delivery MUCH improved this year!,"My first review focused on how inconsistent the delivery was. I have to say that for the past four months, they have not missed a single day of delivery. The Kindle 2 has it by 6 AM most days. Kudos to the people who have been working hard to fix the delivery issues!The only glitch still in the system is that stories sometimes repeat or the headline says one thing and the story is about something else. This happens maybe 2-3 times a week. Other than that, the MN is doing great with the Kindle program. I love reading RoadShow and the different sections and not have to bother with a paper or with recycling."
3,Same ol murky news,Bought the paper that day to read about hurricane Sandy. But what does the kindle edition put up front? More drivel about those marvelous Giants...
3,The SJMN Incomplete Edition,"I'm a print subscriber to the SJMN and was hoping to switch to the Kindle edition. However, the Kindle edition is: 1) missing some sections (e.g. real estate), and 2) not necessarily full coverage for your area (e.g. it appears that some news listings are from the peninsula edition and do not include articles specific to the san jose/valley edition). Finally, the paper is free of advertising, which is great, but can I really live without the Fry's ads? ;-)Until the complete paper is available, subscribers may want to hold off on purchasing or make sure they are comfortable with the limitations."
2,Not worth subscribing to,"The articles were fine, just like the printed version; however, there were no pictures, graphs, maps etc. Also if you're interested in following your local sporting teams, don't expect any nice table of statistics for individual games, or team standings. Frankly I was disappointed."
3,"Good, but not complete...?","I was a long-time subscriber and I love the Kindle, it's my way of feeling good about reducing paper and I can get my ""paper"" anywhere. However, it seems like you don't get the complete edition. For example, in the Sports section, the day after a 49er game always has articles by Ann Killion, Mark Purdy and Tim Kawakami. I haven't seen anything from them on the Kindle. What is odd is that I can go to the website and read them for free, but not on the Kindle and I pay for that? I admit that I'm a new Kindle subscriber and have only had it for a few weeks, but I don't recall seeing anything articles from these popular (and good) writers."
1,Cancelled Trial Subscription,"Delivery via Kindle comes late in the morning PST and at varying times.I subscribe to the paper version and have received the paper version everytime before I have the Kindle version.As of 730am Saturday morning, the Kindle version has not arrived but my paper version has been here since 530am. Unfortunately, this makes the Kindle version ""obsolete"" for my purposes.Content is fairly close to actual paper."
3,Needs work - updated,"The paper needs to have a proof-reader review the Kindle addition for:1. duplicate articles2. extraneous editing chars and commands3. headings not in bold or separated by blank linesHowever, reading the Kindle version of the Mercury News is still better than reading the paper version and getting your fingers black from the ink.7/28/2011 UPDATE:I recently came back to the San Jose Mercury News Kindle edition after a long stint with the New York Times.There has been improvement in the proof-reading and formatting that I criticized before.However, when I compare the Kindle edition to the hard-copy edition, the Kindle edition is very lacking.Only about half of the articles are in the Kindle edition. And the missing articles are not minor ones either.I hope the San Jose Mercury News starts concentrating on their Kindle edition because that is where theirfuture lies. I will give it another few weeks before I start looking for another alternative."
2,good newspaper but unreliable delivery,I used to live in San Jose and always thought the Merc was a good paper. So I liked the idea of having it delivered to my kindle. But in the first week the paper was late once and never arrived 4 times. This is just unacceptable. So I have canceled my subscription. After all it doesn't matter how good a newspaper is if it never gets delivered.
2,where is it?,"great paper, lousy delivery. the whispernet delivers only 2 per week on average, and those two are late."
2,Silicon Valley Low Tech,"This used to be the premiere paper in the Silicon Valley but it has deteriorated over the last several years. That said it is still much better than anything else in the San Francisco Bay Area. One would think, however, that the newspaper of the tech center of the US would be able to deliver a complete electronic version of its paper on time. This, unfortunately is not the case as it is repeatedly delivered after 6 am and today there was no sports section whatsoever. If newspapers do not evolve they will die. As a life long newspaper reader, I hope they can quickly fix these problems before it is too late."
1,Weak.... Too biased and no photos,Content is real dry and weak with no photos. Just a real dry RSS version of the news. Obviously a half hearted effort that was put together in less than a day.
2,Not much of interest in this rag,"I tried this one, but found very little worth reading in this newspaper.Quite shallow and not enough articles.Maybe if you live in the San Jose area it might be better. Not for me...."
2,No Laughter for the Leery,"I completely understand why the Cross-Word and other puzzles are not on the Kindle newspaper; but, I do not understand, at all, why the Comics and the Classifieds are not listed on the Kindle edition. It's a good thing I got the trial version, because I'm canceling my subscription until this is rectified.Dena M.Salinas,"
3,Unreliability finally got to me,"I enjoyed the Me/urky News for the Silcon Valley and Bay Area perspective, but finally got tired of the late and missing issues, and in my present need of cost cutting, cancelled. If it's still around when finances improve, I might try it again, but for now I'm back to just the NYT and WSJ, plus the AP news update ""blog"" for Kindle editions.Sad that the prime techie area of the West Coast, of all places, can't seem to manage to produce a Kindle version newspaper reliably. Almost as sad as the fact that California's capital can't produce one at all."
1,not for PC,"Here's something Amazon doesn't tell you. They'll only send newspapers (and magazines?) to Kindle devices, not to the Kindle application on a PC (or Mac or iPad?). I bought today's paper to see whether it was complete enough to consider buying a subscription, but the ""Kindle for PC"" delivery option is greyed out. I'll finally get to read today's news in a week or two or three or whenever Amazon finally decides to ship my Kindle. Well 50 cents isn't much to throw away, and it helps me decide whether or not Kindle newspapers and magazines make any sense."
3,a long time print subscriber,i like the ease of reading the news but i really miss the living section and dear abby. i do get tri valley herald in print though and the sections are nearly identical
2,Not bad when you actually get it delivered,"I had the print edition for a few years but wanted to cut down on paper waste so I subscribed to the Kindle version.For the first few months it was working out fine, but recently the delivery was spotty and late.I finally canceled it."
2,when it works,"Great product when it works, but just like a real newspaper...delivery is attempted but does not come through even when Qued."
3,Delivery Problem FIXED?,"I did not give the SJMN its full 14 days simply because of inconsistent delivery times. Living on the East Coast amplifies the issue, but 1 day I received the paper before 8AM, the other days, anywhere from 9am to 5pm. I prefer the content of the SJMN to the Chronicle, but the Chronicle seems to make it to me so I can read it in the morning. This is still a new product, I will probably revisit next year to see if they get serious about supporting this media."
1,From bad to worse...,"I have subscribed to this newspaper since I received my Kindle 2 in early 2009 and I agree with all the bad reviews here. But within the past few months it has become worse. They tried to improve it by adding many pictures and charts, but they removed the category of the article. For instance, the Roadshow column no longer introduces it as Roadshow. It just says ""News"" at the top and starts into the column (with no by-line). Same thing with the Letters to the Editor. It just says ""News"" at the top (it no longer indicates it is a ""Letter to the Editor"").Also, this newspaper is not available in the Kindle Fire?? Why can I read it on my old Kindle but not the new Kindle Fire?I wish they would fix this, it is very annoying. I am considering canelling my subscription over these issues and just reading the news in a browser."
3,Silicon Valley's electronic failure,"I like the Mercury and when it was among the first papers available on the Kindle I switched from home delivery. The price even with its limitations of tables, sports rankings, and graphics is well worth it to get local news of Silicon Valley business and high school sports.BUT, the continuing problem of late delivery is frustrating! Last Sunday the Merc didn't come at all. We just got a note from Amazon apologizing for not being able to send the paper. Today it's another delay.So, this multi-year subscriber is cancelling and going to the Chron. Sad."
2,so so,"satchel seemed deeply swayed by the current state of the seattle grunge scene when they recorded this. here's a band with great sensual soul driven music caught in the unavoidable hype of post nirvana grunge. sadly, they gave into the grunge a little on this album and the result was something forced and unnatural.Fortunately, they took their strongest, most distinctive song on EDC (Suffering) and built off it on their follow up, THE FAMILY. THE FAMILY is a far more defined album and captures a better look at what Satchel has to offer."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this for my daughters 2nd birthday. Withing the first 5 minutes the back of the chair part for the high chair had broken off and would not stay on. The first time she went to take it in the bath Pooh's arm came off and will not go back on. I am just really disappointed that it wasn't anything as great as I thought it would be. I saw the it in the store and was excited that my daughter would love it, but sadly it was very depressing for both of us."
5,Penetrating analysis and more!,"As a former Student of Professor Moses, I had the opportunity to read and analyze his book. While the book can get very complex at times, demanding careful reading, it rewards the reader with deep analysis, interviews with top personnel during the crisis and a new approach to the Hostage Crisis in general. A must read for anyone that considers himself an avid student of international affairs. Juan Pablo Adame Arnedo"
2,Hit or Miss,"I purchases 2 of these, one for the front and back yards. It worked great when my old neighbors left their pitbull out all night. After about a week he figured it out and stopped. They moved out and a new dog moved next door and ignores the device completely. This dog has a very high pitched bark that borders on a squeak and I don't think the microphone picks up the frequency, that or this dog doesn't mind the noise. I even put both devices in the same yard and there is no difference in this dog's barking. I recommend this for bigger dogs with a deeper bark but not for those really annoying high pitched barkers."
4,return customer,this is the second divice i purchase just to cover more area cause the first one is still working fine
2,Product,I purchased the Viatec BCX16g around the first part of 09. and it has quit working. For what I paid it should of worked longer.
4,Worked for me!,"I have a very talkative and stubborn Yorkie and purchased this device to use inside my home. I can't say that it completely stopped him from barking, but it has drastically reduced the frequency and duration of his barking sessions. Even on silent mode the device sets off a slight high pitched tone when activated that is audible to the human ear. Most folks probably wouldn't notice this, but if you use it inside your home I (something the manufacturer does not recommend) you will probably be able to hear it."
1,DOES NOT WORK!,The high pitch frequency didn't work on any size dog. The Audible alarm got their attention but didn't stop them from barking. I now leave it on to hopefully annoy the neighbors into doing something about their dog. When I was shopping for this product in desperation I ignored all of the negative reviews and clung to the hope that I would be the lucky one. $60 dollars is too much to blow on this. It doesn't work and I beg anyone reading this not to waste their money.
1,It Doesn'tWork,Item did not work. Dog barked less that 10' from unit and it did not activate. I had to tap it with my hand before it would work. Waist of money and time.
1,trying different barker breakers,"This product is totally useless. It responds to people talking or walking by or any noise at all. It is loud, but has every animal and human cowering in corners, not just the offender. There's a lot of innocent victims."
1,unaudible? sure!,why does it say..unaudible to humans? maybe my unit is defective but whener it gets activated it can HEAR a high pitched squeal. an d the audible toggle is VERY loud. maybe im a dog? maybe this unit is defective? who knows..I couldnt even set it up since i was worried that my neighbors would HEAR this thing go off each time..very dissapointed overall
4,I love it!,"This F$#&%ing thing is awesome! I tried it on the dog across the street as soon as it arrived, the dog shut up right away. Great! So I took it to the back yard to try it on the neighbor's dog, which barks constantly through a wood privacy fence. Turn it on, the dog shuts up; turn it off, the dog barks, back on, silence. It has only been one day so we will have to see how it works long term but it works for now. It looks like I can now be in my yard without hearing that stupid dog. Thank you Bark stop."
4,Works well but..,"It works well but I had placed the device only 20 feet away from the dog. It took 3 days for it took work effectively. The first 48 hours, the dog barked its head off even more because the sound was aggravating the crap outa thing. It started growling too. It works great now but I still have two complaints:1-There was no manual on how to make the device work seamlessly. There could have been some info on how to tweak the device, even though it seemed simple (Keep sound all the way up, sensitivity level should be adjusted according to other noises in the area, etc..)2- It's not waterproof! Why wouldn't the manufacturer make the damn thing waterproof!? It's an outdoor device for christ sake.Anyway, if you want a dog to shut the hell up, buy this product. Worked for me!"
1,M.Paige,"I 've only had it for a few days ; This product worked great for the first 3 or 4 days ; now , my dogs just totally ignore it and continue to bark.I would not recommend it.In fact , I would like to get my money back."
1,Does not work on my dog,Length:: 2:02 MinsPiece of junk. My dog has to be standing right in front of it for it to work. It wont go off at all if he is not standing right in front of it and he is a big dog. Even when it does go off he doesn't care and still barks. Plus I have noticed that pincher bugs get into the system. I have found many crawling out of it!
1,Might as well give $60 to a homeless person- it would be more rewarding,"Our dogs didn't even notice when we used this. We tried all settings, and they just looked at it and tilted their heads. Kind of endeared us to our dogs a little more, as they looked so cute and funny tilting their heads back and forth like furry bobble heads, but other than that it was LITERALLY a waste of money. Now have to deal with shipping it back for return."
1,This is a toy,"The Super Bark Stop is a toy.It is supposed to be used outside, yet it is not waterproof. On opening the package, one of the buttons was broken.I activated the device with the barking dog about 15 feet away. She didn't even take notice.When I tried to return to the seller, I was told they will charge me a percentage because the box was open.I told them that the device was broken and a try, they did not care.I have to go through Amazon to get a full refund (after weeks of waiting)Stay away from this device and stay far away from this seller."
1,Not worth the dog poo under my shoe,"Audible/inaudible switch makes no difference, it's all the same and WAAAAY audible, but, the dog is unfazed by it.Sensitivity switch is meaningless, will only fire a tone when you press the test button.Don't waste your time on this PoS, instead, get the birdhouse shaped one available here; it works, just eats batteries quickly."
1,Junk dont buy,"Bought this item thinking I pay a little more and get something that works..Not. The only way an audible sound is heard or not heard, is to hold down the test button yourself, otherwise when the dog next door barks, only 20 feet away, no response from this device. I called the company to as kwhat the deal was and they just blew me off. like it was operator error, Please. Save your money. I found the hand held ones work good but you have activate it yourself."
2,Worked for a little while,"It worked for a little while, but then quit. Only way it would work afterwards was to throw it at them. But company took it back OK."
2,Sort of works !?!?,"When I first purchased the ""Bark Stop"", I thought it was working, but now I'm not sure if it is. The test function works but I have no way of knowing if it is working in automatic. It is either I have a neighbor that has really stupid dogs or they just don't learn.I will give it a little more time before I trash it."
2,disapointment,"It does make a high pitched sound but the audible inaudible switch does not work you have to live with it's screech. The sensitivity control seems to be in a 1 to 10 range it seems to work from 1 through 4, or from quite sensitive to moderately sensitive. The best thing I can say for it is that it does not eat D size batteries by the case. The first set has been in it for 4 weeks. Made in China, and it has the Chinese quality sticker on it.Does it work to quiet a dog? It does get the dog's attention and will quiet him most of the time.In trading emails with the importer, they seem to try to be as nice as they can be, while putting many obstacles in the way of making it returnable for replacement."
3,Signal still not strong enough,"I was hoping this Super Bark Stop would be strong enough to reach to the neighbors and stop those dogs from barking whenever were outdoors but no. Apparently, even chainlink fences will stip the signal. I was very disappointed. I tried."
4,It works great for me.,"The person next door leaves a small dog out in their back yard 24 hours a day, and, that is usually how long the thing is barking. Talking with the neighbor, animal control, police produced no results.My unit arrived after a night long barking session a week ago. I mounted it under an eve of my house with a clear line of sight into the dog's area, about fifteen feet away. The dog barked three times, the third sounded like a question mark. The constant barking has stopped! The dog will still bark once in a while but it is at a much reduced volume and only one or two barks (smart dog).For this to work you will need to mount it with a clear line of sight at the offending dog. The dog will need to have good hearing, some older dogs, like people are a little deaf. This dog is about a year old and seems to have very good hearing, also, it appears to be a very smart dog.Good dog (now) and a great product.Kennote: edited to correct spelling"
4,This has helped,"We've two large dogs next door and they used to bark *ALL* night. This device is about 30 feet away from them, higher than the fence that separates our yards and now they may bark occasionally but it is definitely shorter lived and intermittent. Bottom line: it has helped."
1,not worth the money,"Not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs, but the company also refused to provide a refund/replacement after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing. After sitting out in a rainstorm, the Super Bark Stop shorted out and is now totally worthless. Find another product - You'll thank me later."
3,Mostly works,"The unit appeared to work in silent mode initially. However, either the neighbor's dog got used to it or it never really worked. In audible mode, however, the unit worked wonderfully. Not only did the neighbor's dog stop, but also went away from the area. Of course, the dog's owners may not appreciate you using the unit on their pet. But if they are inconsiderate neighbors to start with, then this will work."
2,"Works, sorta","I had the Lentek ten years ago and it helped quiet a full kennel of neighbor dogs...but didn't help to quiet the noisy owners!! This time, I tried this model for our yappy poodle-mix puppy. It was less sensitive than the Lentek, didn't last but six months, and we were careful to bring it in during rain. I'm switching back!"
1,"Super Bark Stop ""Stops"" Nothing",I contact customer service twice and complained that the unit did not work as advertised. The first time I was told I had a defective unit and the 2nd time I was told the person who really knew about these was not in. I left my phone number and 2 days later still no call. Poor customer service and an even poorer product.
1,youre better off throwing rocks,"What a complete and utter piece of crap. I got thing thing in the mail today and followed the instructions. It didnt even register that the neighbors 5 PoS chihuahuas were even barking. I tried to simulate a bark and it would only work if I literally put it in my face.Dont waste your money people. Youre better off just going and knocking on your neighbors door and smacking them in the head everytime their dog barks. Better yet, invest in a case of those hand held air horns and blast it anytime day or night at your neighbors bedroom window when their dog barks."
5,"Very effective for DOG at ""Neighbors from Hell""","The Super Bark is a more powerful unit (with a larger speaker and driver) than the popular ""BIRD-HOUSE"" model, and has numerous controls and settings as well--to customize to the environment. Getting a Nasty neighbor's dog to SHUT-UP is not always simple, and does require some patience. But this unit is a good choice--and the price is great.Caution: there is an AUDIBLE sound emitted from this model--when it triggers--which lasts for about 3-5 sec. It's just a high pitch, but your neighbor WILL KNOW that something is being utilized. In our case, IT WORKED RIGHT AWAY! Very happy.Use a 3-VOLT A/C ADAPTOR(not included, std long round plug, OUTSIDE +),or 3-D Batt."
1,Very poor product,"Not even in the right frequency range, don't buy this, humans should not be able to hear but you can."
2,Not for the true True Crime readers.,I was dissappointed by this book. It's very slow and the author goes into too much detail about the hynosis the suspect goes through and the various thoughts on multiple personalities by doctors and lawyers. This book is really more about multiple personalities then about a murder. I was interested in finding out more about Tom Bonney's childhood and why these personalities came about to begin with. Author is too vague and doesn't describe the years leading up to the murder. What went on in that house for years living with this multiple? I was expecting a little more action and instead I got a boring medical journal.
1,deadly doorstop,"Ted Schwartz is a competent prose stylist, but this book suffers from an unconquerable problem: Schwartz never makes us care about any of the Bonneys. The book is slow and boring and not worth your time or money. It might make a colorful doorstop, but beyond that, forget it. If you want to read a well-written and fascinating book about a multiple, I suggest ""The Minds of Billy Milligan"" by Daniel Keyes. THAT book will keep you turning pages till the end."
1,This book is poorly laid out and very difficult to read and,I agree. The book starts off with dcpromo.exe and then moves onto driver signing. Looks like a tornado hit this layout. It is difficult to follow and nothing builds to anything. They talk about mmc in the early chapters and then go into detail later.Avoid!!Get the MCSE Win 2k acclerated Training kit from Microsoft Press. You can get them for [price]dollars like I did from the used book section.(saved [price]... thanks amazon!!)
1,Not the best material,This book is poorly laid out and difficult to understand. Thankfully I have other books to use as a reference.
5,I passed 70-240,"This is a key part of any study guide you will assemble for the Microsoft 70-240 exam. The book ""explains"" how things work so that you can ""think"" your way through the 70-240 exam. The companion book is total questions and answers....and the answers ""explain"" why the correct answer is correct and just as important; why the other answers are incorrect. The book also makes an excellent desk reference because it has an extensive index. This book set (two books, 2 CDs) alone is not the total solution to pass the 70-240 exam, but it will help you get there and you will keep it for future reference on the job."
1,Not the best material,This book is poorly laid out and very difficult to read and understand. Thankfully I have others to refer to.
3,"Good read, but not THAT informative...","if you read Scott Keith's rants, you'll like this book. Don't expect too much in the way of new info on the wrestling business, but it's a pleasant waste of three or four hours. My one gripe is that a good thirty percent of Keith's writing in this book is just transplanted material from his wrestling reviews/rants....which means that I skipped through a good chunk of this book.But still, you can do much worse things than kill a few hours with this book...was a nice waste of 4 hours at [local store] for me while I waited for my folks to finish their shopping, personally."
3,Perfectly Acceptable Reading.,"If you're a fan of Scott Keith, you're probably going to look into buying this title. And if you do, be prepared for a slick and glossy recap of the WWE's misfortunes and miscalculations from 1993 on up. Hyped to be chock full of those famous Scott Keith rant-worthy opinions, this book disappoints. After that ""The Buzz on Professional Wrestling"" mediocrity, anything would be better but, it still feels as if Keith is holding back from ranting in favor of giving the reader a basic rundown of the WWE's stupidity of recent years, most of which is common knowledge to begin with. Hopefully, third time is the charm and we'll get a true Rant-styled read that will not seem so much like a text book. In the end though, this title (while slightly disappointing) warrants a thumbs up and is worth the read on a dreary and rainy day."
1,One of the reasons I don't tell people I am a wrestling fan!,This book is incredibly poorly written and there are several factual errors. I might recommend it to someone who's just starting to watch wrestling or just learning how to read. You're better off saving your money and going to one of the many wrestling history sites on the internet. Mr. Keith would be advised to do a little more research before writing his next book.
2,Some History Please,"I have to admit I have not read the book. I only browsed through the few pages available, but that was enough to show me that there must be other glaring errors on the other pages as well. First photo of one of the Yi Dynasty Palace structures is labeled as a pagoda! Wow! Nothing Buddhist at all in that very Confucian piece of architecture. Next, we ostensibly have a ""Shinto Shrine where students studied""!!! Shinto is Japanese and had nothing to do with Yi Dynasty Korea, where this structure comes from. Simple errors like this show me that this book may be fine for the neophyte, but lacks any sense of depth in Korean culture. Egads!"
5,Three fantastic authors...three heartwarming stories!,"Christmas Gold contains, Colorado Wife, by Cheryl St. John, Jubal's Gift, by Elizabeth Lane and Until Christmas by Mary Burton. All three stories will warm your heart as we move into the holiday season. This is a real treat!"
3,Out of date ...,"I really like Webmin and use it often since I'm not a Linux geek. There is good information in the book and it is well edited and presented. The problem is, the book describes an outdated version of Webmin. The program has a completely new interface which is sufficiently different to make this book much less desirable as a guide to the program.In my view, this book contributes to understanding some of the Linux configurations for which Webmin provides an interface. But, if you are looking for help in using Webmin itself, you may be disappointed. I was. I probably won't return it, but I wouldn't have bought it had I known. I would love to see this book updated."
2,A Doctrinal dissertation,"The author writes as though for other PhD's and I think most would find this a very pretentious book. That said the author does give good information on the Messiah starting in chapter 3 (71 pages into the book)and on the librettist Jennens (the Arthur , organiser arranger of the lyrics) The lyrics came first . He goes into detail on the reasons for the sutile changes in the scripture quotes and why. This book is very informative if something of a struggle to stick with I would skip the first two chapters . Chapter 3 is the reason for the three stars and worth the price of the book if you are a fan of Messiah by Handel/Jennens"
4,"Godd price, little problems","I ordered the T-30 IBM laptop because of the great price advantage. The product was delivered fast. However, I ran into a problem right at the first day. The CD drive seemed not working. I took it to a repair shop that confirmed that the CD drive was not working. After contacting the seller of Amazon, they instructed me to send it back for repair or replacement. Getting the replacement took two weeks and cost me additional $40 in shipping. No reimbursement was offered. Since the, I have no problem with the laptop."
2,Decca's answer to Joni James?,"Ms. Kenney sounds like Joni James trying to imitate June Christy (common factor: both sing juuuust this side of flat). If you are a fan of either singer, you might enjoy this bland and deservedly obscure chanteuse. If you are looking for jazz singing, or even pop singing with style, look elsewhere. As for me, I'll wait until this is out of print, then put it up on eBay."
1,good when it works,"THIS JOYSTICK IS GOOD WHEN IT WORKS, AS STATED BY OTHERS IT IS VERY WELL BUILT AND HEAVY & STURDY.I USED IT ONCE AND WHEN I TRIED IT A SECOND TIME IT DIDNT WORK AND IT DID DAMAGE THE VIBRATION FUNCTION OF MY PS2.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AND CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE# LISTED FOR PELICAN AND THEY SAID THAT THIS ITEM IS VERY OLD AND THAT THEY NO LONGER MAKE IT, THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.I DONT RECCOMEND THIS IF YOU OWN A PS2.I REPEAT I USED IT ONCE AND I HAD BOUGHT 2 OF THEM AND WHEN I DID TRY THAT 2ND TIME NIETHER OF THEM WORKED."
1,Out Dated & Over Priced,"This is an 8 page article for almost $7. My fault I didn't read carefully enough and thought I was getting one of Peterman's books. Amazon states someplace you can return a mistaken purchase of an e-book. Well, good luck with that. So I read it. This article ends the story 8 years ago, and the situation now is quite different. (See Wikipedia) This article is interesting, but no especially impressive insight in those 8 pages makes them worth the price."
2,disappointed,"Though a great idea, the book was not commensurate with the tone and expectations the title gives. It was like reading an old college textbook in philosophy. I wanted more of a 21st century pace and style. Good try but the content wasn't as catchy as the premise."
1,Breaks too soon,"First, I have to say I was very satisfied with the noise reduction. I wear headphones in a call center and it really helped not to have to listen to those around me. But, in less than a month, it broke in half. This was while it was on my head so I was not pulling on it or stretching it. In fact, I did not even care that it folded up and was not something I used.I definately think it is a great idea to buy a Noise canceling headphones, but stay away from these because it will break way too soon."
4,"Whoa, is this review thread screwed up","You can ignore most of the first 10 reviews and the 10 latest reviews, because they're about books other than Strange New Worlds V (the erroneous entries are for Strange New Worlds I and Strange New Worlds VI). The entries in the middle are for the correct book (and most specify Strange New Worlds V). It's funny how the librarian's rant about the 'City on the Edge of Forever' story actually looks like Harlan Ellison's writing style.Anyway, in my opinion, Strange New Worlds V is a very good book, although not the best of the Strange New Worlds volumes. My favorite story by far is Robert Jeschonek's 'Shoulders of Giants'."
2,Disappointing,"Thirty-year-old Bron decides to write a book about love at first sight, a topic he knows nothing about (love and relationships are not Bron's strong point). How lucky it is then that he meets Flora, a gorgeous but troubled girl. Of course, he falls in love with her--at first sight. The relationship does not flourish, though. On the contrary. And the end that Nicholson chooses to give his book is both sappy and clichéd, although it might please those readers who need a happy ending, no matter how improbable."
5,A Touching Tale,"""From Anna"" tells the story of a young German girl whose family moves to Canada.Anna and her family learn about physical handicaps,financial problems and cultural differences as they settle into their new home.Most of all,though,they learn about love - a love that overflows at Christmas into a gift - a gift from Anna. I read this book more than twelve years ago,as an eight-year-old in a school library in St.John's,Canada.My family,like Anna's,had just moved to Canada(from India),and I was learning to cope.Like Anna,I too had to wear glasses and struggled with the same feelings of insecurity.Even today,I will never forget how I identified with Joan Little's book.I just hope that this tale will touch the hearts of many more readers."
5,Changes Could Happen !,I liked this story when I first read it because I was able to relate to the main character Anna. My family always teased me about me being clumsy and in a way Anna and I had the same thoughts. Its really a good book because Anna makes small miracles in herself.
3,Good product for fun play - but not sturdy enough for most children,"My 2 1/2 year old boy really liked playing with the product. Had some minor issues with putting it together but manageable for most parents. Does provide some time for fun play but easily falls apart with some ""rough"" playing and use. I wouldn't recommend kids stay inside much longer than 15-20 minutes because the inside air does not circulate very well and some plastic residue chemical smell is still apparent."
1,Cozy Crap House,I wanted to kill myself within ten minutes of opening the box. Don't buy it. Let your kid make a tent with a chair and a blanket or the couch cushions instead. The maker of this toy must hate parents.
2,Plastic Suction Cup Grips break easily,"Bought two sets of two of these things, and I am down to a single one. There is a plastic bracket which holds the suction cup. The strength of the suction, on the suction cup is much stronger than the plastic, so should one try to move the shade without grasping it just right, the plastic bracket will break. Should your automatic windows roll down to far, and the suction cup does not come off, the bracket will break.A metal bracket would be a welcome Engineering Change..."
5,Amp Album,This is album is very amp. My favorite song on this album is One For Me because it really ministers to people. This album is the one. Everyone should get this album. Peace!
5,Making their mark!,"I really love this third album by Trin-i-tee, iv been a fan of theirs since they released 'God's Grace', a song that reached me on so many different levels. This album truly is magnificent but i am at a dilemma, i can't choose my favourite song! they are all so good. I love the slow jams so i wasn't disappointed with this album i liked the songs 'Rescue Me' and track 2 'Lord' as well as 'People Get ready'... if you havent got this album, i Suggest you get it right this minute and may the Lord Bless Your Heart. Well Done GIRLS!"
1,Horrible third attempt!!!,"This was a horrible album by Trinitee! Their first two albums were true contempo gospel albums.However, they were getting too ""worldly"" with this one (meaning, they were too secular). They even stooped so low to sing a song to their husbands, about teenage love and that nonsense.It's foolishness! If you're looking for good contempo gospel, I recommend Mary Mary, Donnie McClurklin or Kirk Franklin. Trinitee usually fails to mention the saving name of Christ, instead singing about ""Him"" and ""He"".Horrible cd. I should throw it out!"
3,The Kiss,"I've waited a great deal for T 5:7 to release their new cd. I must say that I was kinda surprised. Don't get me wrong this cd is great but I was looking for something more. A lil' more versatility. My favorite song(s) are: the kiss, and # 15. Adrian, their 3rd new member had a lil solo on #15. She has such a sweet voice. She should sing more often. But definitely this cd is worth buying."
5,Kick you in the butt..get the junk in your head out yoga class!,This DVD is a great workout and also helps you let go of the stuff in your head that's stressing you out! The Baptiste flow that is taught in this DVD works your entire body and feels great! Get ready to sweat!
1,Complaint,"Two ""Springmaid"" crib sheets were ordered and neither one fit the crib mattress. What is wrong with this product? I bought another sheet at the store and it fit. So it is not my mattress. No Bargain."
2,battery issues,"This would be a great toy for my son, however, he has had the toy less than a week, and we have had to replace the batteries 3 times already. It is not as much fun if the T- Rex doesn't make sounds. I am extremely disappointed in the toy."
5,AWESOME,"This toy is so much fun, travels well, and boys and girls will like it. The best toy received this Christmas!"
3,Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Production System,I am Teacher in Celaya Tech and review the book for recomendate a my students in Industrial Enginer
5,The parable of the lily,"I would highly recommend this book . It was a joy to read it to my 4 year old. The bible verses are wonderful. My Husband and I were both impressed with it's creativity in explaining what Christ did for us at Easter. The little girl in the story represents us, lost and unsaved, her father is our Holy Father, the forgotton bulb she throws away is Christ, which comes back to life. Refering to the store of the Lily, my little girl said, ""Mommy thats' just like Jesus""! It made me feel so good that she understands. Get it for you little one and God Bless."
4,The Parable of the Lily,"Like the other parable books by Liz Curtis Higgs, this is a wonderful story for children that has a lesson to it. Maggie learns the lesson of forgiveness and the true story of Easter. It is a book that will surely bring a tear to the eye of a mother reading it to her child. I recommend it highly."
3,Yet another out-of-print Mizerak intro book,"As beginner pool books go, this really isn't bad at all, as it covers the basics, and gives reasonable advice about things like position play, frozen-to-the-rail long cuts, banks, etc. But, there are far more comprehensive volumes out there now, such as Play Your Best Pool and Byrne's Standard Book of Pool. This old book here is mostly just a collector's item. The cheezy early-'70s shots of the young Mizerak with big sideburns are priceless."
2,Incomplete!,"Roberta Flack is conspicuously missing from both the DVDand CD releases. I have the original LP soundtrack, andsaw the original film, both of which included her greatperformances. I don't know if this was her decision or thefilmmakers, but you cannot call this the ORIGINAL film."
1,Blank Apparel is awful,"I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a ""freebie"" and too small for much use anyway.Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it! She must have been an Amazon). I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn!"
4,Great!,This is a really neat video. My boyfriend and I are both huge airplane nerds so this was right up our alley. The video is nostalgic and is a neat story. The only reason it only gets four stars is I wish it had a little more detail and went a little longer in length.
1,written for a 12 year old,Good prose means being able to read between the lines and surprising how much can be sensed about the author's mind regarding its fertility and subleness let alone about the characters themselves which are in 2d in this book.
3,Lost on the Tour,"Ocassionally confusing but full of profound ideas. The alternate, parallel history plays like a dream. A fully layered but ultimately flawed book, with breaths of the brilliance Erickson will display later."
2,Just plain weird.,"I'm not a huge fan of the music on this, and my 11 month old son just wasn't interested. There are too many slow songs and it seems as if we are watching one family's home videos set to music they find sentimental. There is an attempt at being educational by showing the letters of the alphabet and some numbers, but otherwise, I'd say give it a miss. There isn't much racial diversity and the music is too slow to interest the very young. Try Baby Signing Time instead."
4,2 years old and still loves this dvd,"I bought this dvd/cd combo when my son was around 8 months old. He enjoyed watching the kids and graphics on the TV screen as well as listening to the music in the car. He's almost two now and still loves this dvd/cd. He calls it ""dance show"" and asks to watch it every morning before I take him to daycare. He's learning to say the alphabet and numbers that are featured on the dvd as well! Part of the dvd (like the puppets) might seem strange to adults, but kids really seem to love it! I enjoy most of the music myself."
3,It's cute but doesn't do much,"This is a cute toy but my daughter didn't play with it that much. The gear noise it makes when it moves is quite loud. Every now and then she gets it back out to play with, or little brother will play with it. It is durable, my kids aren't super gentle with it and it still works fine after a couple of years, so that was good. It just doesn't do much and didn't hold my daughters interest for very long."
3,Panda Fur Real Bear,"I bought this for my grandaughter about 1 month ago. She played with it for the first 2 weeks and now it just sits in her toy box. She is 3-1/2 yrs. old and she told me the bear was smaller than the one in the video and that it also does not give hugs like the video shows. She was also disappointed that the bottle served no purpose. The toy just stretches and opens it's eyes and moves arms up and down. We were both disappointed, especially since the video made it look larger than it actually is and I have yet to see it hug."
5,the toy panda,"this toy panda is a cute,loving caring thing.it's like your own actual real pet.now how cool is that.it recives an adoption certificate and encludes your panda's very own panda bear bottle.now how much more could you ask for.wait a minuite its a great price 12.85your panda will open and cose his/her eyes and will also make adorable baby panda noises!requiers triple AA bateries.bateries not included.Im Lovin It!!!!"
3,Decent,"This is what my daughter wanted. I thought it had a ""feeding"" mechanism that it would ""take"" the bottle and stop crying. That's not what it is. You press the tummy and it moves and makes noises. That's all. Oh, well, if you hold your hand on the tummy, it ""goes to sleep"". Thankfully it has an on/off switch! :)She likes it, but didn't play with it very long. Keeps it in her bed."
4,great bridesmaids gift,"My bridesmaids loved these earrings. The quality of the ""sparkle"" as well as the quality of the Peridot drop was better than expected and the price was quite reasonable."
1,Pointless Book,This text is pretty much pointless to own. All it does is derive equations that make things more complicated than they need to be. I haven't found it helpfull at all with my class. My old Dynamics book is much better at explaining things and the stuff in the first three chapters of this book is basically stuff already learned in Dynamics but made 10 times more complicated.
5,Great Quality Book,"The book was in pristine condition, well worth the price. I buy textbooks for school from various locations, and found that for this particular book Amazon had the lowest price. It was in new condition when I got it - I have no complaints."
3,"The nature sounds are great, but...","I bought this a while ago and found that the nature sounds are great...unfortunately, the buzzer is very weak...I do not tend to sleep thru alarms and found myself having a hard time waking to this alarm...I have since bought a new alarm and wake up to it fine...but this is great for nature sounds and I use it when I want to hear the sounds..."
2,will not watch again,"found this rather boring.some big boob's yes,but alot of the girls weren't that hot.nothing here that makes me want to watch this again.but some might like it..."
2,Same as all previous versions ?,"Un-cut ! and Uncensored ! The same as it always has been ! If this is the ""Special un-cut Directors Edition"" why is the run time exactly the same as the previous 4 or 5 releases of this movie. 86 Minutes. If you're (That's a contraction for YOU ARE) thinking of buying this DVD in hopes that it may contain added scenes, you may want to wait until someone who has seen it writes a review here on Amazon or do some research on it yourself at other web sites."
4,Excellent except in one respect,"The good:Techniques in Street Safe I were covered in Street Safe II.Good explanation as to how and why the techniques would work.Lots of traps, just in case your attacker isn't a moron and knows how to kickbox.Weapons training shown on the second tape.Drills are shown to develop attributes necessary to win a fight.The bad:Made in the mid-90s, it doesn't address groundfighting. Especially since the techniques and traps work only in close proximity, the possibility of being taken down, falling backwards, tripping on a bottle in a bar, is high."
3,So -So,"Some of the humorous stories are funny, cute; some are a bit too dirty (yes, dirty) for my taste and some I just don't get. A friend recommeded this book and if I did not buy it used, I would have felt cheated. Borrow the book from someone instead of buying it."
2,Don't Waste Your Time on This One,"The author readily admits that some of the jokes have been around, but I found that there were very few jokes that I had not heard before and most of them were just not funny.A few of the jokes were surprisingly dirty. Many were irreverent, but that is to be expected in a joke book. However, a couple of jokes were beyond the pale, at which point I stopped reading and deleted the book from my Kindle."
4,"Great tunes, but not deep enough","I'm sorry for Shorter that with Weather Report he no more played like he had done it ten years before with Miles Davis. But still the rest of the band grooves in a way I did not hear very often (especially in the ""Badia""/""Boogie Woogie Waltz"" medley and in ""Black Market""). What I hate are the not-live tunes in the end (""The Orphan"" and ""Sightseeing"")."
4,A few good songs,"2 or 3 really good songs, including the definitive live version of Jaco's Teen Town. The rest is boring.I bought it for Teen Town alone, and I wasn't disappointed. Jaco was INSANELY good, IMPOSSIBLY good. After about 25 playings I'm still shaking my head in disbelieve by the end! You will not BELIEVE what this guy could do on bass!"
2,The problem with live albums...,"... is that, when done badly, they're just a greatest hits collection with all the songs done faster and sloppier than on the original albums. I love Weather Report, but this is not their best work. Buy their studio albums first (starting with Black Market and Heavy Weather, moving on to their self titled album, Tale Spinnin', Sportin' Life and Mr. Gone) and then, if you're hooked, go on and get 8:30 as you complete your collection.If you do, then you'll be annoyed by the fact that this isn't a complete re-release: Columbia cut some tracks from the original, with the nonsensical justification that the original double-LP version is too long to fit on a single cd but ""too short"" for a two-cd version. Now it'll probably be impossible for true fans to ever get the missing tracks, unless we can find an old vinyl or cassette copy in a second-hand store somewhere. What's the point in re-releasing allegedly classic works of jazz if you're not going to release the whole thing?"
5,real weather report,"I really enjoy this cd is a very good recording,I prefer live recordings, and the selections of tracks are very good."
4,No Scarlet Woman!,"Great Music! I have nothing to add to the previous positive reviews.Sony, Where is SCARLET WOMAN? It is a disgrace to leave out one of the best tracks just to fit a double album on to one disc!I am glad I kept the vinyl.Otherwise this would be a 5 Star CD *****"
4,Informative but too drawn out for teens,"This documentary gave a lot of great information about the history of tsunamis and the why and how, but was a little too drawn out for teens, unless they are really into detail. My group has short attention spans so I previewed it and wrote a worksheet to go along with it to keep their attention."
1,solar fish,"solar fish got sucked into the filter, pool now cold again the chemical blanket is now filtered out, I will continue to use solar cover instead"
3,Decent collection of Pop Hits,"Small selection of pop hits. Collection seems a little short with only 6 videosVideos-The Coors- Breathless from In Blue (2000)Natalie Merchant- Jealousy From Tigerlily (1997)Duncan Sheik- Barely Breathing From Duncan Sheik (1996)Sixpence None The Richer- Breathe Your Name from Divine Discontent (2002)Donna Lewis- I love you always forever from Now In A Minute (1996)Linear- Sending all my Love from Linear (1990)A collection of light pop hits, so-so. I would recomend this if you are looking for a specific video on this collection or Enjoy the artists or light pop sound. Pretty good deal for a dollar a video or so."
4,Nice Compilation of Doll Artist Biographies,"Several prominent doll artists who create black dolls are featured in this full-color, hard cover, coffee table-style book. Some of the artists featured include Floyd Bell, Patricia Coleman-Cobb (whose work of doll art is featured on the front cover), Helen Kish, Lorna Miller-Sands, and Goldie Wilson (just to name a few). A small selection of dolls by each artist is included with each artist's biography.The forward by Barbara Whiteman, curator of the Philadelphia Doll Museum, is an added plus, as is the artist directory.Designed to provide information about those who create black dolls, the book does not provide doll value or reference information.http://blackdollcollecting.com"
3,"Good, but not great","First of all, I wanna say that I doubt The Beatnuts will ever make an album like Musical Massacre again. It was their ""Illmatic"", a modern masterpiece in which Juju & Psycho Les came with their best beats to date and did what most rappers cannot, which is not just pile songs on a CD, but make a full, complete & well-rounded album. That being said, I even think the Nuts' last LP, Take it or Squeeze it, is better than this but as always, the beats are so original and well made (especially Originate, co-produced by the master Large Professor) most people can tell the Nuts really know how to dig in the crates for original & crazy funk music. No weak futuristic, keyboard-based rhythms here, these boys really sample dope loops and drums that are their trademark. Overall, nowhere near what the boys are capable of, but worth getting to either complete your Beatnuts collection or here some great production."
4,dope but nothing compared to (the second album),"the album is hot but i still think nothing can compare to the 1st and 2nd album their beats are still hot check out coming soon im dropping the best of the beatnuts, ..."
4,Good value for the money,"This is a two disc set. Disc one contains the movies ""Count Dracula and His Vampire Brides"" (aka ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"") (1974), ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964), and ""Fangs of the Living Dead"" (aka ""Malenka"") (1969). Disc Two has ""Grave of the Vampire"" (1972) and ""The Vampire Happening"" (aka ""Gebissen wird nur nachts"") (1971). The quality of the transfers is average - there are visible scratches from the original prints. There are minimal extra features - a couple of bio pages and a stills gallery. But overall it's a nice collection of some decent movies at a bargain price."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Does NOT cling to the window, therefore does NOT work. This is just a piece of heavy plastic. I would have returned it, but the shipping exceeded what I paid, and it wasn't worth a penny. DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,not so great,"My German Shepherd loves balls. In fact she loves to just hold them in her mouth and crunch on them. These balls and tennis balls last about two days after an encounter with Chauncey. The thing ends up coming apart in two hemispheres! She could care less about a squeeker, but those don't last long either. I ended up buying a ""Dur-A-Ball"" from Menards, $2. She's been working on that one for a least a week!!"
3,Definately Not for Heavy Chewers,"Overall this was a pretty cool toy. Tennis Ball + Squeaker good duo. So i gave it 3 stars. I thought this might be a little tougher than the average tennis ball because it was made by Kong which usually takes my dog atleast a week or so to destroy so considering the reasonable price i bought it. Much to my dismay, my dog demolished it in less than 24 hours. Firstly, he pushed the squeaker into the ball so it had no squeak. then he found the hole where the squeaker originally was and stuck his tooth in it and proceeded to basically rip it in half....it was kind of comical. but he had fun with it so it was worth it :o)"
5,Ball crazy OCD Golden loves this ball,"My golden loves these balls. I've tried a ton of different kinds of ball and this is the only one that lasts and lasts and entertains him for a long time. I buy them by the dozen so I always have a backup. The little squeaker balls are good for smaller dogs but mine isn't much interested in them since he's had these big ones. A few of the squeakers have failed but not many and I've only had one ball split open in over two years of using them. He still carried it around, squeakless and deflated, not ready to give it up until my other dog finally got it and lost or buried it (the way all his balls go to die) Once in a while he will lose one and I'll give him a new one then he finds the lost one and has two. He loves it, like it's Christmas. He walks around with both stuffed in his mouth looking like a big chipmunk. If you have a big ball-lover dog you need to buy them one of these balls. They are the most fun!"
5,Great squeaky ball!,We bought this ball for our 75 pound Golden named Buddy... He has a ball in his mouth at almost all times and squeaked this until he annoyed our other dog and several family members.Now the ball is missing and I keep looking for it. Our baby would stick the ball in Buddy's mouth and laugh at the squeaks. I will look a few more days and then break down and buy another one. This is a GREAT toy! Unless you are sensitive to noise... :)
1,junk ball,"squeeked 3 times and quit. squeeker is ratting inside and if ball pops can be very harmfull. same thing with small one I bought , it lasted about 4 hours.50 pound dalmation, not cujo. pass on this one from china."
2,de-furred,"This ball was completely defurred and torn in half, squeeker removed in less than 1 hour by 2 pit bulls playing"
4,squeaksqueaksqueak breathe squeaksqueaksqueak,"I like this bigger squeaky ball even though I'm a medium dog.It's fun but I tore the cover off of it in an afternoon, so now the new one lives in the toy closet until playtimes. It's hard to get the squeaker out of, though. Much harder then other squeaky tennis balls. For the price it lasts well."
3,Fleeting entertainment,"My dogs do enjoy them - probably due to ball yielding when they mouth them (unlike sealed tennis balls) - but the ""squeakair"" inside had a very short lifespan. My dogs area all medium-sized Dalmatians and can generally de-squeak one of these within the evening. Luckily the squeaker falls into the ball and not out where they could be choking hazards. It's probably for the best, though, as the squeaking can be *very* loud."
3,My dog loves to hear it squeal,"My dog loves to chew on it to make it squeal. He will also butt it with his nose to make it squeal. Unfortunately, he also loves to peel off the yellow fuzz skin."
1,Doesn't hold up,I bought this expecting it to hold up since it's Kong brand. That was not the case. Our golden retriever split the ball in half the first day.
3,"Fun ball, but our aggressive chewer was able to destroy it pretty easily","My 100 lb German Shepherd loves balls (especially ones that squeak) and usually goes through a tennis ball in a few hours. We kept this one up and only used it for fetch, but he still destroyed it pretty quickly. I agree with other reviews that this isn't any more durable than a regular tennis ball. So I am still searching for a squeaky ball that will last..."
1,No more durable than regular tennis ball,"We bought this for our 50-lb tennis ball destroying dog, and while she loved the squeaking feature, she destroyed it less than 20 minutes of play. I was very disappointed and would not think of paying this price again for what amounted to just another tennis ball murder. Glad I didn't buy a three pack!"
1,Another busted toy,Took about a half hour for my golden retriever to break through this ball. I had thought that due to the large size it would be harder for him to break apart but was sadly mistaken as the seam of the ball was split a few inches apart the first and last night he had it. Disappointing for a kong product.
2,Only lasted two days.,"The dog loved the ball because of the squeak, really loved it too much, broke the ball after two days, and I mean probably 15 minutes of play time each day.I do not recomend this toy for big dogs (mine is a german shepherd)."
2,Not as tough as a regular ball,"I bought this for my puppy because of the squeaker. However, she ripped the ball apart without much problem. The actual ball is fine, but all the green 'fuzz' rips off very easily. I've never seen a regular tennis ball do that."
2,Not for serious chewers,This lasted less than an hour for our 80lb APBT. Ripped it completely open. I thought being a Kong it would hold up longer.
2,loved it but killed it,He loved this ball played fetch with it but it didn't last four days. I thought since it was a Kong product it would last longer but it is split in half.
4,Not My Favorite,"Danny Wright is one of my favorite musicians, but I did not like this album as much as some of his past albums. It showcases his remarkable talent in nine of the eleven tracks. Although very soothing and relaxing, I found that the pieces in this album had a tendency to sound the same as you listened to its entirety, other than the two non-original compositions. I prefer his albums that have an orchestral accompaniment over some of his solo albums. If you are a Danny Wright fan you will probably like this; however, I would not recommend this for your introduction to him. It's a good, but not gripping album."
5,The Best of Do You Live Do You Love,"Living and Loving is,as the title of this album says. The music gives a feeling of living and loving your life wthout ever giving thought to another way of living or loving.Joel Crump"
3,Wolverine (Dakura) Safety Glasses -- Silver Frame with Smoke Lens,"Great inexpensive safety glasses. Do not stay on your face, am always adjusting them back to my eyes, they don't ""grab"" the head like some of the others and stay put."
5,Stunningly beautiful portraits of East-meets-West style,"Yes, it's expensive, but if you can afford it and are even slightly drawn to a retro mix of Eastern and Western standards of beauty, it's well worth the investment. Gorgeous reproductions, with amazing depth of color. Full portraits followed by well-chosen details. Highly recommended!"
5,Praise,"As an Australian, I think it's wonderful to read not only a story set in my country, but one that is authentically set. The descriptions of the outback are so real that I can smell the dust. Ms Proctor is a wonderful writer and something that is even more rare, sensitive to the way we thin-skinned Aussies view others writing about our country. Add to that vivid characters, a believable plot, and you have a very, very fine story. I can't recommend this author highly enough."
2,"flat, predictable plot; main characters lack chemistry","This book begins with a colorful setting and a promise of much more than it ever delivers. Amanda and O'Reilly never seem to develop into persons that the reader can care about, nor does the chemistry between them appear genuine. The storyline was so boring and pedictable, even for a historical romance novel. I suggest Barbara Bickmore's ""The Back of Beyond"" for a real taste of Australian history and romance."
5,THIS IS ONE ROMANTIC BOOK! O'REILLY IS ONE SEXY MAN!,If you like romance books that keep you waiting you will love this one. I could not put this book down. Candice Proctor has done it again with her wonderful story telling! The man in this book makes your heart go a hundred miles and hour! What a hunk!
5,Masterpiece,"Vermeer is my favorite Renaissance artist. The child is absolutely beautiful and, in my view, is more beguiling and complex, with a hint of both sexuality and innocense, than the Mona Lisa."
1,worst looking ring i've seen so far,"i don't usually write reviews.but this ring is so bad that i had to write a review, so that other people won't be disappointed with buying this ring.i bought the ring because picture looks very good and it looks like it's very well made with high quality.but when i got the ring, it was so cheap looking that i thought it was a joke.ring looks like one of those 25 cents toy that you pull out of vending machine.cz doesn't have any sparkles at all.and cz is not even all the way around the ring.it covers only half of the ring.all in all, it's the worst looking ring i've seen so far."
5,my christmas present,i saw this watch and wanted it for christmas. actually showed my husband it and game him the model number so he would get it right. Thanks
4,Links were hard to remove,I like this watch a lot. I had to take it to more than one jeweler in order to get the links removed. But other than that it is a great watch!
1,Started to buzz and had to return,"This lamp looked great and was easy to adjust. It worked fine for about a week. Then, it would start buzzing at the base after it was on for about 15-20 minutes. I had to return it."
2,Light bulb (13 watts) lasted only 5 weeks,"The light given by this lamp was great and pleasing to the eye. Unfortunately, my bulb went out after no more then 20 hours of use. On close inspection, the 13 watt buld was made in thailand. I now must go to Home Depot to purchase a replacement for approx. 13.50 (with tax). Hope the replacement is better then the one that came with this lamp."
4,Very bright light at a reasonable cost!!!!,I would of gave this a 5 star if there wasn't a slight soft buzz when lights are on. Although it doesn't really bother me but at time I like complete silence you'll hear the little buzz. So if you like complete salience in your room and work area then this light is not for you. If you have music on and noise in background then this light is for you because the background noise will drown out the buzz.
1,The worst Detroit has to offer,"Listen, if mediocre rappers saying Detroit over and over again make you feel good about living in Gross Pointe, Farmington Hills, Sterling Heights, etc. then go for it. But if you prefer real MCs with talent . . . STEER THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
3,"Fine Live Album, but...","if you're a Maiden fan you're surely heard all these songs so many times before that you don't need yet another copy of them. Now if you're totally new to Maiden I can see how this might be a way to introduce you to them from their oldies, but goodies up to their 2003 ""Dance of Death"" stuff.I'm a huge Maiden fan by the way. And this is not worth $25 like Amazon is currently trying to get for it. I say look around. I bet somebody has it for less. Or at least they should. I'd have the video of this concert, but after seeing the hyper-active editing of Rock in Rio and reading the reviews that almost universally bash Harris for his butchering of this concert as well I didn't want to see anymore two dozen camera angles per minute again for a couple hours."
2,Poor sound!!!!,"Buy this CD, only if you're a very, very, very Maiden's fan to complete your collection, because the sound is horrify (poor production)."
3,How much is too much?,"Live After Death, Live at Donnington, Real Live One, Real Dead One, Rock in Rio (and Maiden Japan)..... Good sound, same material including the Dance of Death stuff. No such thing as bad or too many Maiden live albums, but these guys are pushing it."
2,NO DISRESPECT TO MAIDEN,"I, for one can take it or leave it, but not because of any lack of quality on the part of this, arguably the greatest classic metal band ever. The choice of songs on this was a bit redundant, as many are available in Live After Death, a live album compliled when Bruce Dickinson's voice was still in it's prime (it's not bad now, but let's face it, it was better back in 1985). It would have been better if the producers had chosen more of their newer song, rather than compile extra live repeats of songs that were better sung 20 years before."
2,One of the worse maiden live albums,"And i'm a huge fan of Maiden. i even saw them on this Dance of Death Tour in Los Angeles (drove 7 hours to get to them) and it was great! This album... no so great. the mixing is absolutely horrible. the vocals are way too loud, compared to the rest of the band. Also, you can REALLY tell that they jack up the volume of the crowd at various points. normally, i like this. it sounds awesome to hear the crowd chanting along with Fear of the Dark, or Trooper, etc. But it sounds horrible on this CD.My advice, DONT buy it. I wish I hadn't. If you want an old-skool Maiden live album, go with Live After Death. If you want a more recent Maiden live album, go with Rock in Rio. Hell, I have BOOTLEGS of this show that sound much better than the mixing job done here."
2,Come On,"This live album is well recorded, and the band is the best its ever been. Why only 2 stars? The tracklist! Apart from Can I Play With Madnes (yay!) and Lord of the Flies (yawn), its exactly the same as Rock in Rio, released a couple of years ago, with Dance of Death instead of Brave New World songs.Why not play Somewhere In Time, or Wasted Years? Or Futureal (ok Blaze song but still)? or Powerslave? All would have fitted into the theme of the concert well. I don't need to see another version of Hallowed Be Thy Name. Or Wrathchild. Or Fear of the Dark. Or Run to the Hills. Good performance (as expected), but VERY disappointing tracklist."
2,Terrible sounding......,"I am a BIG Iron Maiden fan, like that's all I talk about, but when I heard this album, I was apalled. It frightened me. Bruce may be getting old, but it's just too much of a difference from Rock In Rio. I can't believe anyone would give this a 4-star. Maybe it could pull a 3, but I want 2. It just sounds terrible, you can barely hear the guitars over the screaming crowds! That's just crap! It's basically like, I died when I heard this, and then when I find out it's copy protected!? Ok Iron Maiden, you guys have gone far enough with that. This is just terrible, sure I'd give the artwork a 5-star, it's way better than the Dance of Death artwork, um EWWWW!But there you have it, a true Iron Maiden fans honest opinion."
3,Death to the Repeated Live Songs,"Every time Iron Maiden puts out a studio album, a live album is soon to follow. That isn't a bad thing in theory, but when they put out a double disc with the same songs as their previous live album, it's a waste. Who needs another live ""Run to the Hills"" or ""Number of the Beast""? Fortunately, on ""Death on the Road,"" they do six songs from ""Dance of Death,"" and two older songs - ""Can I Play With Madness"" and ""Lords of the Flies."" If you have their other live albums, especially ""Rock in Rio,"" those are the only songs you'll want from this."
4,The Trip Continues,"Another great release from Lycia--Definite influences from Sam Rosenthal, ""Black Tape For A Blue Girl"". You can't go wrong if you like Projekt Records. The music has matured and the guitar sound is much cleaner and acoustic. All the songs don't mesh together as before. Ambient and mellow as usual."
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"Lycia enjoys a small but devoted following. They employ a style of acoustic guitar and mellow keyboards layered harmonically with the beautiful vocals of Mike and Tara VanPortfleet. The effect is to produce haunting, pensive images and stories reminiscent of Dead Can Dance, or some of Pink Floyd's early acoustic work. However, what I couldn't get past was the total lack of percussion in their work. This is quiet, brooding music, but it barely seems to move at times. The advice I would give a 1st time shopper for their titles? Listen carefully before you buy. Lycia is a ghost ship that never leaves the port."
3,good,"good pistol good range,im not very good with airsoft guns but from what i seen so far there pretty good. The only problem i can think of is that when you pull the ammo clip out the plastic piece and spring flys out and takes you about 5 min. to find it again. At the moment i lost my spring and plastic piece so i have no use of the clip can anyone tell me where to buy a clip for this gun?And do all airsoft guns take the same clip?"
1,Not the Best Romance Story,"Anything for Her Marriage seems like a promising story. The theme and plot appear to be interesting but the story rambles. The author has adopted a tone of voice that I disliked. She uses the word ""oy"" a lot.The leading man, Rod Braden, has too much emotional baggage including two kids, an ex-wife, and a time consuming business. The leading lady, Nancy Shapiro, has too many cats and not enough going on in her life.I usually love stories like this one but Anything for Her Marriage was not for me."
1,Awful!!,"This DVD is basically a Power Point presentation in which the creator speaks about Pythagoras. It is not interesting at all! I am a math teacher and I bought this to show my students, but instead I'll be tossing it in the trash! It's not worth $1!"
3,A useful addition to the textbook.,"Useful if you are having trouble with figuring out how the information given becomes the report shown in the textbook. Expands on the subject matter, gives useful hints and methods, and shows you how to do things the right way."
3,"Cute, but loud....",Cute toy... doors pop open so fast & the sound is so loud my daughter was a little scared of it at first and wouldnt go near it.
2,Not like it was when I was young,"I went out looking for this type of toy for my daughter so that she would learn to manipulate things. I found this at multiple stores; however, I didn't buy it because the Ernie button didn't work well. As an adult, I had great difficulty making it pop open. My 10 month old daughter certainly wouldn't be able to do it. Again, I've been to 3 different stores and all of this toy that I've tried didn't Ernie work well. I'm not sure if they had a bad batch, bu I didn't get it because 25% of the toy was unusable for my daughter."
4,Entertains my 3 1/2 yr old,"I took my daughter shopping to buy a 4 yr old bday present for her friend. My 3 1/2 yr old played with this toy the whole time we were in the store and she begged for me to buy it for her. She still plays with it everyday. She sings along with the characters and then laughs really hard; It's cute.Just got it this weekend, so we haven't had any problems with it not working, as stated by other reviews. My only complaint would be there's only 1 volume and it's pretty loud. MIght have to get the tape out and cover up the speaker."
1,So sad,"This toy is cute and fun, but breaks right away. The music doesn't always work, and the doors don't always open.It is so sad, because it is so cute."
1,Unhappy!,"The toy is very entertaining when it works! No real educational value, but my son loves the characters and the songs. I got it in early May and it no longers sings songs as of June 30th! I paid a lot of money for it and now it doesn't work! Very dissatisfied!"
2,Pop-Up's A Bust,"Toy is attractive and songs are enjoyaable, but they are brief excerpts. There are only four things you can do with this toy. No room for creativity. Very over-priced."
4,Great fun,"Got this toy for my nearly one year old son and he loves it. So does my 3 year old daughter! The songs are very cute, but I love that you can turn the sound off when you're tired of it, and they can still play with the buttons to open the doors. Yes, the music doesn't always work on a couple of the buttons, but that hasn't stopped my kids from loving the toy. Great buy."
4,great toy!!,"My daughter loves the music and charactors of this toy. She loves Elmo & Cookie Monster. I have to admit myself & Daddy get a kick out of the songs!! She loves to dance to the songs also!!! Although I have to admit, the toy is lovely but seems like it will break eventually. With her playing with the doors opening & closing herself or the toy doing so."
2,My daughter loves this toy but.....,My daughter loves this toy but it does not always work!The Elmo (which is her favorite) does not work at all.
2,Good Concept but Not Long Lasting,"My son got this toy for Christmas this year and he really loved it. However, very quickly it stopped working properly. He would hit the buttons to open the doors and the characters did not always sing. Ernie has stopped working all together. It is too bad because my son really got alot of satisfaction when he pushed a button and the music would start. He would start clapping and waving his arms. Now, he barely touches this toy. I would not recommend this item because it is not durable."
4,19 month old daughter LOVES it,My 19 month old loves this toy.. The buttons were easy to push and the doors easy to close for her. She loves the brief songs that each play.. Each play a brief version of the character's song.. Elmo- Elmo's World; Ernie- Rubber Ducky; Cookie Monster- C is for cookie; Oscar- I Love Trash.. She plays with this toys for hours at time and even asks for me to interact with her..
3,very cute but....,"This toy is very cute, especially if your child watches sesame street, but my 1 year old lost interest in it quickly. The pop ups should say more different things."
3,Fun but not made well,"This product is very fun and great for kids up to 5 years of age even. However, it is not made very well and quickly stops working properly. Cookie Monster's door doesn't open anymore and Oscar the Grouch doesn't sing when he's supposed to."
3,"Hits and misses, but the hits make it all worthwhile.","I had a very hard time rating this album. There are some wonderfully crafted songs on here. The vocals are so expressive, and you feel good listening these tracks. Something you don't get from too many rock records of late.But then there's filler. Too much for a band that obviously has to chops to do better.I'll leave aside any comparisons to The Stills last album, this is nothing like it. If you are interested in hearing some feel-good, melodic indie pop, complete with piano and horns, this is definately worth purchasing. The two opening tracks are excellent, and they close out beautifully with ""It Takes Time"" and the living-room-dance-party ready ""Destroyer."""
1,"No ""logic"" here.","A major disappointment. I saw them here in San Diego in April. ""New"" guitarist Dave remarked after the show that he's singing on almost all the tracks on the new album because ""I wrote almost all of them, so I should be singing them"". Um, no. Dave should stick with drumming. He has no business singing, as Tim does that perfectly. Now all they need is a replacement guitarist, and to do away with the keyboardist."
4,delayed gratification...,"Like most fans, I found the different sound of this album really jarring after Logic, but after giving it a few listens, it really grew on me. Some of the arrangements are quite complex, and you can still tap your foot to it. And, if I owned a car, I'd say this is a great album to drive around to. It Takes Time is really catchy, as are Helicopters and Oh Shoplifter and the ""young and plain"" song is just beautiful/wistful in tone. I also really like Baby Blues, which features a duet with the great Emily Haines.There's nothing on here that fully captures the sound off of Logic - this has more of a classic rock sound to it rather than poppy - but again, if you want to give this album a shot, keep in mind that the new Stills are, indeed, without feathers."
2,Just saw them last night....,"I just saw The Stills last night for the first time and I didn't know they had released a new album until they started playing. I liked the ones I knew--I didn't like any of the ones I didn't know (which was about 75% of their set.) They have good stage presence and I really loved when they played the Logic songs. I thought I would give their new songs a try so I listened to them here. If you see them live you will hear the songs on this album and they WILL sound better but...c'mon these songs still suck! An album really shouldn't have to ""grow"" on you to like it. If I didn't know about Logic Will Break Your Heart and I heard the samples on this album as a stand alone I would pass right on by. Here's hoping their next album (if there is one) goes in a different (but hopefully smarter) direction."
4,This record is actually good,"It's too bad that so many people have ripped this album simply because it doesn't sound the same as the last one.I'll admit, the first time I listened to ""Without Feathers"", I hated it because it was not what I was expecting. However, a week later I listened again with an open mind, and was actually surprised how much I liked it.It's not an AMAZING album, but then again, neither was ""Logic..."". If you're looking for a CD of about the same quality, and enjoy rock that doesn't sound like Interpol, check it out!"
1,Why is this even being sold?,"What was the record company thinking? not much i presume, typical sophomore album: ""okay the first one sold, now hurry up and get another one on the shelves while you're still hot."" worst thing a record company can do to a band. just terrible. A band with this much talent should probably focus on making great music, their fan base is driven by the sound they created on the first album, and by allowing this to hit the shelves pretty much gives me the idea that i never want to see this band perform live. Absolute shame, i wish i read the reviews before i bought it, seriosly, this is the biggest waste of money ever, ... ever."
1,Possibly the end of The Stills,"This album is such a huge 180 from what used to be The Stills. I don't even consider this to be the same band. The band I knew and loved is now gone with ""Logic"" as far as I'm concerned. I found it mildly amusing when Dave sang ""Yesterday Never Tomorrows"" at the end of each show in previous years. Kind of a novelty ""the band having a good time"" type of song, as he can't hold a tune to save his life. Little did I know he would take over entirely on vocals for this album and make their music such a mockery. Not to mention the gospel organ they deicded to add to each and every song. Hearing Tim on the whole two tracks he sings for this album just makes me hit the Stop button and pop in the first and last Stills album, ""Logic Will Break Your Heart"""
1,THIS MUST BE A MISTAKE!,"I had such high hopes for this album! Logic was an amazing album, one you never tire of listening to... so I had anticipated a great new album... ""Logic"" was like love at first sight... but this new album, it's just an incredible disappointment. I listened to it one time and found it monotonous, uninteresting. I gave it another chance, listened to it again and had to stop. Terrible.I can describe it in just one word: BORING!Do not waste your money!"
2,"""See me change...Changes are no good....""","""Logic..."" is one of my favorite albums of all time. It has a very distinctive, mellow, starry-eyed late night in Montreal feel. I truly fell in love with that disc.I was optimistic when I popped ""Without Feathers"" in. The following hour or so was filled with jaw-dropping disappointment.I'm fine with bands evolving. Their sound changing.Look at Radiohead. It can be a beautiful thing.But apparently not in this case. It's a shame really.If you are looking for something like ""Logic..."", save your money and yourself a little frustration."
2,The dreaded sophomore effort that should have never happened...,"...they should have called it quits.If you havent read all of these reviews yet, let me, if I may, put them all together.We all love Logic Will Break Your Heart, however this is not the same Stills that you know. There are little, if any, redeeming qualities here. You will be dissapointed in this album. If you end up liking it, God bless you and call me a fool."
2,"Very Different, and in a Bad Way","Gone are the inspired nu-wave anthems that combined heartfelt vocals, jangling guitars and a penchant for the dramatic. This new album sounds like a half-hearted attempt to cover a generic pop rock band. I'm all for a band trying to broaden and change it's sound, but not if the end result is something that would fit in perfectly on a Starbucks in-store soundtrack cd."
2,Flat!!!,"I don't have a problem with a band changing sounds or genres as long as the music is still good. The songs on this album are monotonous drivel and go nowhere (ok, maybe a little harsh). Dissapointing, however, after their killer first album.This album may have some fans out there, but it just missed with me."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"As others have already mentioned there are several reasons to avoid this release. First of all, where did they get the title? If they are referring to the song, it's called ""ISN'T IT GRAND BOYS"" not ""AIN'T"". This release comes in a clunky plastic box and most of the music sounds like it was recorded two blocks away. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem deserve a first rate box set. Sony/Columbia surely has endless hours of unreleased material to choose from...and please release some of their great early records on CD. ""Heart and Hellish"" and ""A Spontaneous Performance"" should be made avaliable."
1,Unrealeased?,"It behooves me to relegate anything Irish to one star and in fact the music itself is great it's just that most of the recordings ARE released and I have 'em however if you don't have other music by this group it would be grand to have this one. In addition it's a little on the short side being about 100 minutes of music. There are better releases but you'd have to buy several CD's to get all these plus a few LP's,some 8 tracks and LP's"
3,"If you have everything else, you don't need this.","The Clancy Brothers are one of the preeminent Irish bands and this CD purports to be a collection of unreleased ""gems."" Well the ""gems"" part is true but if you have read the other reviews you will see the problem with the ""unrelesed"" part. Still The CD has a number of worthwhile songs and is well-worth a buy if you are a casual fan. For the hard core fan you have these songs already. If there ever was a band that deserved a well-researched box it is the Clancy Brothers. Someday soon I hope."
4,Good music and great friends,"It is true you can get most of these songs on other albums. What makes the album different is that most of the songs are live recordings. As someone who was never able to see the original group perform live it is a true gem. There are a few songs you can't get anywhere else, or at least I haven't been able to find them. The recording show what masters the Clancy's and Tommy Makem were, their good humor and stage presence shines on these recordings."
5,Great Toy,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr. old, who is madly in love with dinosaurs. This is a really neat toy. He enjoys the little cavemen that came with it, the sounds the dinosaur makes, and it is clearly his favorite toy for Christmas. I think what I like the most, is the durable construction, and how it really enables him to use his imagination. It is a little lop sided, because the foot is raised for a stomping motion when you pull the trigger, but this hasn't bothered him in the least.His two older brothers, 6 and 4, hover anxiously for him to put this toy down so that they can pounce on it and play with it, so I think this is a great toy for a variety of ages. I'm looking forward to purchasing more of the collection for all of them."
4,"Good movie, so 2 words for you!","The sixth Pokemon movie isn't a bad movie and most likely all the people who say it s***** are probably in their late teens. Hello? This movie is intended for younger kids, not people who like movies rated R. You may think it's cheesy but you should be glad Ash isn't the main character in this movie. (If he was, this movie would have been a waste of time.) In my opinion, this movie is ten times better than Pokemon2000 and Mewtwo Returns which are all Odes To Ash. I won't tell you what it's about 'cause lots of people already did so."
1,seen better.,My brother brought this home. I had nothing to do so I had to watch this (heres what boredom does to me) This movie really wasn't very good:( There have been way better pokemon movies!
4,GOOD BUT...,"the movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be but their is good humor and the short "" Gotta Dance "" is one of the best reasons for buying but the movie has great color and a pretty good storyline"
3,WHERE IS MISTY?!,First of all I'm 13. But not me about the movie. Well the animation is superb and no theme song and battle some random kid part. good. The thing that ticked me off is May's Wish. She wants Ash. I can see it in her pathetic eyes. I just wished Misty was here so she can do her wish (I would know that too).*sigh* to tell you the truth I miss Misty a lot so I didn't bother to watch in with intrest. The song though is great Chiisaki mono is great.So in other words it was ok but it needs Misty to standout like everyone else
5,Pokemon Jirachi Wish Maker,Pokemon Jirachi Wish Maker Was A Good Movie I Love It! It Is The Best Move Ever Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,good. but not the best,"This was a complete bore. Probaly the worst!Anyways it's about this acient pokemon named jarachi. A kid finds out that jarahi wants to be his friend. Then this eveil magician wants jarachi to unleash this pokemon to get rvenge at the people at the science lab. and thats all I'm gonna tell ya.So, this would be great for kids. but I didn't like it."
2,"Great product, but Has a hissing noise during charging","Like the reviewer above I am getting a high pitched noise when the ipod starts charging. This usually occurs a few seconds after the song begains to play. I called USA-Spec and they were suprised that I could hear this noise. They sent me a replacement, but it was the wrong model !!! I am disappointed in them and at this point I would not recommend buying this because of poor customeer support."
5,"Early Coltrane - It's definately 'Trane, but no ""sheets of sound""","This is an early offering by Coltrane. He plays with a variety of sidemen (no piano on ""Someone in Love"" for example), and doesn't yet play ""sheets of sound"", but this album is definately 'Trane.He's a little more lyrical here, not in as much a hurry. He also plays some standards, such as ""I Love You"", rather than all originals.The highlight of the album is the title track. In fact, this may be the defining recording of Lush Life. Unlike the other tracks, 'Trane has a foil in Donald Byrd on trumpet, and the two play beautifully together. It's also an opportunity for some extended improvisation, as the track is over 10 minutes long.This is a great Coltrane album to start with if you are new to the music."
4,John Coltrane's Lush LIfe,"This is a great recording from the 1950s which has lost nothing in the intervening years. It is interesting to hear the seeds of Coltrane's later style in this recording. The pianoless format suits his sound very well. He had a rythmic sense unique to himself, and a beautiful sound."
4,Great 4X6 photo Printer!,"I have bought two CP720 for $99.00 each from local store. It has several useful functions like 1.5 inch LCD preview monitor, multi layout control, built in USB cable and card reader... Print quality is excellent with anti-smudge coating, you can not tell the difference with print from Photo Lab or even better. Printing time takes about 2 min. Highly recommend this printer for people who want to print snap photos by themselves. Furthermore, upgrade version CP730 has battery operated option, so you can get nice photo lab quality print at anytime, anywhere.CONs; 28 per print. Easy to get dust spot on the final image while 3 pass print processing. No image Cropping function(But $50 more CP730 has it!)"
5,I love this printer!,I received this printer as a gift and I love it. It prints beautifully! It is compact and I love that I can print pictures using anyone's memory card. It's a great way to share images. It beats waiting for a copy you may never get. I also love that I can print greeting cards! I highly recommend this printer! A+!
3,Not great,"After many reviews, I decided to try my first dye-sublimation printer. I was a bit disappointed. My only complaints are about the quality and size of the paper. The size is smaller than a regular 4x6 but I've read this before so I already expected it. Even knowing this, I couldn't get over the size once I personally saw it and compared it with the standard Canon 4x6 glossy plus. The quality is more of a disappointment. The details are not as good as the Epson PictureMate Deluxe that I bought for my parents. I noticed this in the shadows. The hair on my son showed up as a block of black ink. The same photo showed some strands details on the Epson. Overall, I will still keep it since it is the smallest printer I've ever seen and it is fast as advertised. If size is not an issue, I'd recommend the Epson PictureMate Deluxe."
1,Did not work,"There were no cables with this printer, and no instructions or information either. When I contacted the dealer/owner I was told there was no returns. I bought this as a Christmas gift and trusted that buying thru Amazon the dealers were legit. I was Wrong, lesson learned."
5,Amazing little printer,"This little printer is great. I purchased this when I was looking for a way to quickly print out 4x6 size pictures at family events. It has surpassed my initial expectations. I have a Canon DSLR, I can simply take my memory card and plug it into the printer make any minor adjustments I need and print out great pictures. I can also easily connect my laptop to the printer and print out images processed in Photo shop.The printing technology is great when the picture comes out it is ready to go, no waiting for ink to dry.The only thing I recommend is buy extra paper/color cartridges when you buy the printer."
1,paper jams,"Ok, this was my fault for not being careful, but still... When I tried to print an additional photo on the blank half of a used photopaper, the ink cartridge and paper jammed. The only way to take it out was to break the ink cartridge film. (The film was stuck onto the paper) Thus, the entire cartridge was wasted just because of one jam. It's just not worth it."
4,Just Beautiful,this ring is just a very pretty vibrant color of red coral it looks genuine very pleased with purchase but this is not a good ring to wear if you are going to be cleaning or doing work with you hands
4,Worked Perfectly for the most part,"Well other than not being able to find the white version without paying considerably more (so I spray painted the brown version), these worked perfectly for the most part. Does give you full access to your closet and pretty easy to install. I recommend using a socket wrench with a screw driver adapter to tighten the top screw for the sliding assembly though - much better leverage. The only problem I had was when using two sets of these (so 4 doors all together), when I closed one set of doors the air pressure in the closet would pop the other door open a little."
3,Hoped for better,"These work ok and do what they are designed to do for a reasonable price but i wish they were heavier duty. Once u have done one the install goes pretty fast but the directions are a bit unclear. I installed them with a carpenter friend and the first one took two hours while the second one took a hour. These where replacements of older bi fold hardware. I might use them again, but for two other sets of doors in my house I will most likely try Johnson's heavier duty normal bifold hardware."
3,"Bear as in Yogi, Not as in Richard Hatch","These are the same facts as those in the doc ""Grizzly Man."" An eccentric guy decided that he would live near bears and befriend them ends up getting killed, along with his girlfriend, by a bear.""Grizzly Man"" was more biographical and cultural. This work tried to look into the science of the bear bite. This work does not mention that the man tried out for Woody Harrelson's role on ""Cheers."" It doesn't show a bear doodooing either. However, it shows scientists that make a robot that approximates the strength, bite, and claws of an actual bear. A man whose face was half ripped off by a bear recounts his experience and provides color commentary.If you like this work, then you should like the cable series ""Hunter/Hunted"" and ""Fatal Attractions."""
4,"A Great, Great Band","The Electric Flag was probably Mike Bloomfield's most ambitious project. It combined soul, blues, pop and experimental music with an immensely talented group of musicians. Not only was it one of the best things Bloomfield ever did, it also showed Buddy Miles at his best. ""Texas"" is one of the best blues songs ever recorded. ""Groovin' is Easy"" and ""Sittin' In Circles"" are great pop songs, unfortunately, neither one of them charted. Nick Gravenites vocals are strong and to the point. This one or ""A Long Time Comin'"" are both good choices...though there will be some overlap, picking up the both of them is well worth it for the price."
4,"Good Product, Good value","I bought this shift knob to replace the stock one for my '91 nissan d21.Way better, the only problems are that it says universal application in the ad, but mine came with no adapter and only two thread sizes in the actual shifter. The larger threads fit my import, but that doesn't sound universal. Also, it's temp. fluctuates with the weather (hot when it's sunny, cold at night). I think it looks great tho, and it feels way better than my old one."
3,Looks great but they run at least half a size big,I have found the shoes too big and so had taken to adding another insole. The only problem with that is it bring my foot up to the stitching level and now the boot rubs my heel. I would suggest buying the shoe have a size smaller than you need it.
3,bumpin,Something from the past that I thought was really good back then.It's alright. I still love the energy of the songs. and the lyrics are alright. all in all i would have given it 3.5 stars but it doesnt seem to do half.
1,RUBBISH! who wants a play station controller on thier gamecube!,The gamecube controllers are far better than the playstation controllers so why bother making the gamecube controller look like a playstation one!
2,Scratched,"This knife was scratched when I received it, and not very sharp.Although pretty, the handle is slick even when dry. The very needle like point of the knife is really nice though. I have not used the peeler as of yet, but it is a bit heavy."
2,Don't Watch With Your Kids,"I enjoy documentaries. I thought this was very fascinating. That was until the last moments when the pornography entered the scene. That was really unnecessary. I guess people have a desire for filth that they cannot quench. You can't even watch something that should be harmless without filth popping up.The context is that a man was into doing elderly pornography. Ok, we understand what that means. We did not need a graphic scene to demonstrate the point. It was gratuitous and I turned off the film at that point. What a way to cheapen what was turning out to be quite informational.People with low moral fiber will not be bothered by this because it is seen as normal. That is fine. This review is not for you. This is to give the heads up for those who do not appreciate filling their minds with garbage."
2,Boring and long,"This could've been 5 minutes long. Little bits of good wisdom and philosophy, but overall boring not funny and long. Heads up on the old people porn..."
4,Almost love it,"As others mentioned, I wasn't sure what to expect but found the subject intriguing. As with the producer, my mother died recently which has also created a greater awareness of my own mortality.As Mark's friend referred to a book or story ~ it has an ending, if it didn't what's the point.Nothing lasts forever and anything to excess is good for nothing. If we, humans, think we can live forever, then our certain demise is sealed.That said, like an ice cream cone, enjoy life, savor it's sweetness, but don't let it sit or it will melt and if you eat too much, then you haven't shared enough."
3,Toungue-in-Cheek but Outdated,"The true hipster, knows it's embarrassing to be labeled hipster. There you have it...irony so beyond irony, it becomes paradox. Personally, the moment Anything I own becomes mass produced and sold at Urban Outfitters, I know it's time to sell it on ebay. A point which brings me to this book...Now that we are past the 1st half of the decade, surely little numbers such as this book will become no more than fodder for 'We Love the '00s'. So in a word, this book is Hilarious. Just like in retrospect, goldfish inside plastic platforms were hilarious in the 1970s."
2,The Hipster Handbook,"Very slow. Un-necessary unless you are planning to become a ""hipster"". Not very humorous either."
5,"Inspired, hilarious stuff!","So what if this doesn't appeal to everyone? Not everyone has the good taste and the inflated ego to be a hipster!The best thing about this book and the reason it succeeds so well, I think, lies in the fact that Lanham understands how silly this project is, which makes it absolutely fun to read.And if you are a hipster like me, you'll really appreciate the Hipster Hairdos for Men and Women, which include such common styles as the Emo Combover and the Wet Banana.Also great are the lists that examine Hipster Music. There really is a logic to them: David Bowie's ""Hunky Dory,"" for instance. Lanham wouldn't pick ""Ziggy Stardust"" for the simple fact that it's too well-known...Hipster's always seek the obscure stuff.So if you enjoy poking fun at yourself and your lame friends, I recommend this one."
4,People Please,"If you don't see the satire and humor in this book, then you are an idiot. If you don't understand that this book is making FUN of hipsters, then please just quit now, you have no hope, you are lost and always will be."
4,once you write about it...,"Okay, it's funny but once you write about it, it's not deck, it's over. If you're really hip, you'd read it at a friends house while they take a shower, or in a bookstore...but you wouldn't buy it. And if someone gives it to you as a gift, you're dope, and not in the street kinda way."
1,"not bad, if you don't have anything else to do","This book is perfect to take it on a plane. According to this book in order for you to be a hipster; you have to be a little dirty, have a body piercing, have kissed somebody of the same sex, know exactly where to get drugs and be younger than 30. So... no thank you! I though this book was going to be more about the culture of the young Americans. Apparently the ""hipster is about appearance, and a bunch of rules that they have invented so they can be ""deck"".So as a foreign to the American culture I am sure this is just a bad characterization of certain kind of young people that dress and talk in a certain way. I mean there has to be hipster all over the world right? What happened to that possibility?"
2,"""Hipster"" slang is so off or perhaps outdated","I live in an area of the US where the hipster style for youngsters and young adults between 16 and 30 has definitely made a comeback, bringing with it a lot of the retro looking styles as well as some new versions of the hipster look. And this book seems to somewhat classify correctly the dress and perhaps some of the qualities of hipsters past to present, but the ""slang"" they claim hipsters use in regular conversation is completely false. I've partied with many a hipster and never once heard the words, ""frado"" ""bronson"" ""frigidare"" or ""deck"" used in a conversation."
2,Moderately interesting waste of time....,"opinion:If you have a couple of hours to kill the book is not all bad. Pretty funny, but overall just not of interest to me."
1,Food-Court Weenie-Boy's Manifesto,Outdated even before it went to press. The author reminds me of one of those guys who still dresses as a cyberpunk and hangs out at the food court at the mall. These days all you need is an internet connection to stay abreast of what's hip. This book went straight from the publisher to the used bookstore.
3,Amusing,"This book is slightly amusing though not much more than a book of clever caricatures. True hipster has more to do with an ideal or scene that is generally out of touch with the masses; a time and place that is of slight legend within idealism. A place where strange artsy people wish they had artistic talent or possibly they might even have artistic talent, though generally not likely. Hipsters are looking for a haven of the clever, artsy or different. Elegant oddballs if you will, an example being the fictional character Cosmo Kramer, or Scott Walker the singer would fit the bill. Real hipsters are anti-cookie-cutter beatniks, who are looking for transcendentalism and an ideal atmosphere of a comfortable absurdity."
2,Re-inventing the Hippie for the 21'st Century,"Although I have not read the whole book, it sounds to me like analyzing what can be called an ""updated hippie"" re-coined as ""hipster"". I really don't see anything ""new"" here with hipsters...just an extension of the overly priviledged hippies from the 1960's complaining about ""the MAN"" (even though they would be ""the MAN"" now). ""The Man"" is just slang for the establisment (the people, typically white, who ""run"" things in corporate America and politics). I see the same with hipsters...middle-class extensions of their hippie parents who will someday decide to shower and wear grown up clothing when they decide to be the ""MAN"". It seems every generation has a group of over-priviledged young people who complain about things only to become the very same thing they initially complained about in the first place."
3,Funny,"Good stuff. I laughed a lot. I admit I skipped a lot, so I can't give it five stars (and I had a library book, if I'd owned it I would have dipped into other sections later), but found it well-written and funny. Yes, I was a little nonplussed at times to see my ""original"" behavior wasn't so original and was being satirized. That's what prompted the one star reviews below, methinks. But what most ""noncomformists"" do is end up conforming with nonconformists...so, really, you're just a conformist (try saying you love Ronald Reagan at the Gyspy Den, dude...be a REAL nonconformist). But my own pretentions are worth laughing at (dudes, I was wearing a Yeah Yeah Yeahs T-shirt when I read it!). Funny stuff. Maybe not David Sedaris funny (oops, the Hipster Handbook said Sedaris is a hipster fave! Damn these pigeon holes!) but funny nonetheless."
3,Nice costume. Poor sizing.,"I purchased this costume for my son, fortunately well before Halloween. While the company had a no returns policy, they did agree that when they shipped me a 12 month size rather than a 4-6T it was company error. But that doesn't really excuse the month it took them to decide what to do and issue me a return authorization. And then... nothing for the longest time.. hello? replacement in correct size? Someone finally called me to ask if a 4T would be OK, and admit a 4-6T did not exist, and I agreed. Big mistake on my part. My son had just turned 5 but he has kind of a long torso, and the hat didn't fit at all. I ended up sewing modifications to make it fit. I can tell you it's well constructed out of nice material and a really cute costume, but... the 4-6T size appears to be fictional."
3,What? No lamp shade?????,This little lamp is just what I was looking for. The price was right - shipping perfect. Only thing is....NO LAMP SHADE! I didnt read anywhere in the description that it did not include shade. Damn!
5,Star lamp,Lamp is really nice. With a limited amount of floor space this works great on the wall by the sectional.
4,A quick reference for aquatic plants' lovers,"If you are like me that loves a lushly planted aquarium, this book is helpful as a quick reference guide. It describes the most common species, the origin and their basic care (temperatura, ideal water parameters, etc.) However, note that the info is limited on each species but, as a quick fix source is good enough."
4,I was waiting for this like a thirsty man for water!,"HOLY MOLY! I cannot express in words how much I love the Harry Potter series. This book was, although not the best of the series, was very, VERY well written. It was much darker than the first 4 books. It was exciting, suspenseful, and funny. I absolutely adored it. What I didn't like, however, was Harry's temper tantrums. But those cannot be helped, due to events in this book. Happy reading to those who do buy this book. This is a very, very smart investment."
5,Fabulous!,"I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking! This book is an absolutly wonderful book! I couldn't put it down, and literally fell asleep while trying to finish just ONE MORE chapter! JK Rowling has a wonderful background in Fantasy, and a great grasp of the genre. I can't wait until the next one comes out!! :) It could be the fact that I have a background in Literature, and so I found it quite enjoyable, but I think that it is worth reading again and again!"
3,Not the best of the series,I was really looking forward to reading this book. The action in the 4th book was really good and I was expecting more relationships to develop in the 5th book. This did not necessarily happen and I hope this book translates better as a movie.I think it stinks Rowling made readers wait three years for this book. She does not understand what a sequel really is. You don't write a sequel that takes you ten years to freakin' read! She needs to get this together and I hope book 6 and 7 do not disappoint. I think if she was going to do a seven book sequel she should have planned it better.I also find it interesting that auror training takes three years. I guess we will be following Harry even after book seven.Work on your character development. Even the best writers can use a few pointers.
4,The Magic is Back,"Please do not read beyond the first paragraph if you do not wish to ruin the surprises.After a long wait, J.K. Rowling delivers book 5 of 7 to excited Harry Potter fans across the globe. The Order of the Phoenix is darker than her previous books, even more-so than the Goblet of Fire.Harry is much angrier in this book, and rightfully so. Throughout most of the book he tends to shun his friends (and even Dumbledore), and winds up in more trouble than in previous books. Facing expulsion from the get-go, Harry is allowed to return to Hogwarts, but considering what's waiting for him he might have been better off at home.The mystery of Voldermort's hatred is finally revealed at the end, and in doing so Rowling sets the tone for the remainder of the saga. Will Harry fulfill his destiny, or will Voldermort once again reign supreme? Only time (and the next two books) will tell."
5,Great Book,"I have to say that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was good, but not as good as book 4.... it lacked the exitement that book 4 had.And I can't wait till Book 6 comes out, although I hope we don't have to wait another 3 years for it"
2,This IS NOT the book you expected!!!,I got this book a couple of weeks before it came out from a distant cousin. I read the book rapidly until i realized it [stinks]! It doesn't have any of the great key elements form the first Harry Potter and all the new characters are confusing. I went and returned this book as soon as it was released! Dont waste [money] on book that's not all that great! Use your money to get a book like Holes 2!
3,A Slight Disappointment,"This book, though lengthy, has most of the plot located in the last 200 pages of the book. Dumbledore seems slightly out of character, although he provides answers to several integeral questions."
3,Still more growing up to do...,"I found this book to be an entertaining read, but was also disappointed. It seemed to me than J. K. Rowling adjusted the mental capabilities and the maturity level of the main characters to suit the plot instead of the other way around. Some of the decisions they made or positions they took seemed rather implausible given the way they acted in the previous books."
3,"Interesting read, but not entirely appropriate","JKR's fifth installment is a fascinating read. The plot line draws you in right at the start, the old characters just as enchanting, and the new ones quite imaginitive.But this is where the good ends. After reading awhile, one begins to notice numerous scenes dragged out quite unnecessarily in a long-winded speal spanning several pages. The nature of the plot and tone of the book are no longer appropriate for any child under the age of thirteen. This series can no longer decently be publicized as a ""children's series"". Certainly not JKR's best work.More specifics will be posted when the book is further into it's release to avoid the posting of unintentional ""spoilers"""
5,Confessions of a Harry Potter Junkie,"What can you say about a brilliant book? I have read it twice in the past 5 days and I want to know when 6 is coming out. Does this mean I am impatient, not really. Normally I can sit quietly and wait for whatever I need but this book brings the series to yet another peak leaving the reader on the edge of their seat (or pacing the room) just waiting for the next installment.""How is JK going to top this?"" is a good question. ""How I am going to survive long enough to read it?"" is a better one. Thankfully the entire series is good enough that it is worth re-reading again and again."
5,Great Book,"I fineshed this book in 8 hours, and I thought is was one of the best books I had ever read. it was exciting, and I didn't want to put it down. JK Rowling did an excellent job on this one. I cant wait till #6 comes out!"
3,Rating was low because the tapes BREAK!,"While the story is enchanting, the day I got the tapes tape #4 BROKE in my tape player, being soooooo thin that the quality of it did not hold up to normal play. I would advise people to get it in hardcover rather than waste their money on an audio book version; I will now NOT know what happened on tape 4, and that is VERRRRY upsetting to me."
4,Great.......but could have been shorter,"Well, this was the first (yes!!!) Potter book I read. I hadn't even watched the movies (!!!!). But hey.....this is probably the ***BEST*** Children's literature ever.Although critics may call the book dark, I think, if its about a 15 year old, its fine. My only complaint is that the book is a little too long. It could have been much more racier, had it been a bit shorter. But I don't really know, for Kids...it might well be....the more, the merrier.I find the plot pretty interesting, the characterisations, wonderful. Harry's problems, regarding women, are something every teenager faces. Harry's reactions at losing a good friend, are very natural, and add realism to the story. Kudos to J K Rowling, for writing such a wonderful book."
3,I wish I didn't need to wait this long,"May be it's the waiting that heighten my expectation ( by too much). Don't get me wrong, the book is good, and JK Rowling is a good writer ( as always), but there seems to be A LOT in the book - actually a bit too much that make it seems dragging on (and ""all over the place"") . I guess ( or I hope) that's because the author needs to lay down enough hints to lead up to book 6 & 7. Anyway, the book is full of non-eventful events, the best part is the very end, when some ¡actions¡ really took place¡K Comparatively speaking, I still love the previous 4 books in the HP series more ( esp book 3 & 4) and I am still looking forward to Book 6 to come"
5,I reread all the books this summer,And this one was the best and most imaginative of them all. The Department of Mysteries was easily the greatest fight in all the books.
5,Changes for Harry,"This is a bit of a departure from the previous Harry Potter books, in that it's a bit dark. Hogwarts doesn't seem to be as fun and relatively care-free for Harry and his friends this year. This should come as no surprise, considering how the year before ended, with the death of ... As it would in real life, those huge changes really come to play in Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts.This book may be a bit difficult to start, since right off the bat, Harry seems a bit different. His experiences the previous year, along with just being a 15 year old, have made an impact on the boy. Before you know it, though, you'll catch glimpses of the boy we all know and love, and you'll be caught up in the story, as always.J.K. Rowling does Harry, and his gaining maturity, justice in this book. Well done!"
3,A diagnosis for Harry,"Harry is shunned by most of his peers and treated shamefully by many adults. Why? It's not what we've been led to believe.Consider this. In the past five years, Harry has taken exactly one bath. That was right before the Tri-Wizard tournament. In the past five years Harry has never once brushed his teeth. Is it any wonder that other Hogwarts students shrink away, point at him and whisper?It's surprising, really, that Snape hates him so much. After all, as we are reminded repeatedly, Snape has dirty, greasy hair. You'd think he and Harry would be soulmates. I figure that's why Harry and Sirius get along so well. Sirius also doesn't believe in grooming.As for Harry's unreasonable outbursts, why hasn't anyone figured out the diet connection? The kid lives on pumpkin pasties, chocolate frogs and those booger-flavored bean candies. In the latest book, he's also started chugging coffee and tea...."
5,Awesome,"AWESOME!!!!! its amazing isnt it that Harry Potter Books just get better and better every time one comes out. This Book is the best of the 5 and the best of anybook on the market hands down ive never been so absored by such a book in my life pages fly by when you read this book, hours fly by when you read this book. J.k.Rowling is a genius. once agian this book is truly the greatest READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Another excellent book by J.K. Rowling. The detail, twists, and turns leave you engrossed in every paragraph. I have been hooked ever since reading the first and this book does not disappoint."
4,"Not bad, but could have been better (non-spoiler)","I thoroughly enjoyed the book till about the last 4 or 5 chapters. I thought the beginning was well-written and left a lot of room for sub-plot expansion and development that would have made the over-all plot much more interesting. The ending, however, didn't live up to the beginning, leaving a lot of questions unanswered or with very disappointing resolutions. The death scene came across as needless and (to be honest)..., almost like it was thrown in as an afterthought instead of intending to be meaningful like in the 4th book. Over all, the ending was disappointing, instead of expanding the current plot, it seemed to reinterate what the previous 4 books have already established. It seemed like Rowlings was rushed when writing those last few chapters, though I wouldn't have minded waiting longer for a more complete book.By all means, not bad and overall enjoyable, but clearly not the best out of the series."
4,Very good but a different Harry,"I enjoyed the book very much. However, I did finish with a few questions and feel the book wasn't wrapped up quite as cleanly as I would have liked. My questions are since nobody believes Harry about just about everything why don't they teach him the spell that allows Harry to put his memory into the spincher? And, why did Harry not torment himself after he figured out that he could have communicated with Sirius through the two way mirror? We usually always read what he is thinking, why not that time? I also didn't like the fact that Dumbledore lied for Harry, it could have caused more serious problems by lying for Harry. Loved the battle between Tom and Dumbledore and enjoyed the humor in ""that should show you"" fashion. Overall a dark book, with Harry acting like his hormones are driving him crazy."
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,I really enjoyed the book and can't wait for the next one! It was full familiar and new characters. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
3,I wanted to love it . . . I really did!,"I really wanted to love this fifth book in the Harry Potter , series. But reading over 800 pages about a moody wizard boy, was driving me crazy.. .Harry Potter seemed to either be angry, upset, or confused throughout the whole book. I always turned the page, hoping he wasn't going to have another temper tantrum.The story also seemed to move a little to slow for me, and he did not even get to Hogwars until a couple of hundred of pages into the book. And near the end, I was prepared for the ""death of a character"" that I had read so much about. Though the death to someone close to HP came, it was rushed through, and the book seemed to end abrubtly.I can say , I did not love it like the others, but like everyone else, I am looking forward to the next one."
4,Rowling's Superb Once Again,"In J.K. Rowling's latest release, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, readers are transported to the magical castle, Hogwarts, once again. Harry is faced with his toughest battles yet. This novel begins with Harry back at the Dursley's wallowing in self pity due to the lack of communication with his wizarding friends. He is attacked by dementors and swept away to safety where he discovers the Order of the Phoenix and its purpose. Reader's begin to see Potter mature into a teenager and the roller coaster of emotion that typically comes at this age. Rowling's manages to maintain interest for each of the 870 pages. Her writing style is enjoyable and entertaining for children and adults alike. I found this book hard to put down, just like the four previous Potter books. I highly recommend the series, even to those who don't particularly enjoy fantasy novels. I can't wait for the next book of the series."
4,Harry's got issues...,"An interesting book, but was it really worth the wait? Harry seems depressed and therefore the book on whole was less humorous, but I think Rowling still kept it in the vein of the past four. I have to say that when the action got going, it pulled me in, but some non-action was a little too slow compared to the others. Just hope that no. 6 isn't bigger, yea?Worth the wait, but how long will it be for the next one?"
4,WHY?,"You have to read the first four in the series before you read this one. So much is happening to the wizarding wordl and to Harry, it was sometimes hard to comprehend what was happening. Oh, and I cried at then end of the book. It was sad. Why did he have to die? That is so cruel."
5,Great Novel,"This is by far my new favorite novel from the Harry Potter series, and a great psychological thriller, which is probably why it stands out. The first two were great mysteries, the third was a fantastic sci fi story, and the fourth was a compelling horror story, yet this one tests the abilities and limitations of the reader's psychological comprehension. It's as if everything, including Harry's mysterious dreams, the ""weapon"", and Voldemort's moods always seem to amount to something, yet it is not known until the end (and sometimes not completely understood without a rereading, at which point everything clicks, seamlessly). I have only read four other books in my life that kept me glued to the pages, reading until five o'clock in the morning, and those are ""Order of the Phoenix""'s predecessors. What a marvelous novel."
1,Corporate Money Maker,"This is definitely the worst book in the Harry Potter series. It seemed to me that this book was not written with a passion that the othe were. It was written with the publisher pushing for a release date to sell copies.I was surprised at how little happened in this 850+ page book. Harry goes to school and he is harrased by students, Malfoy, the head-mistress, and he has bad dreams. It is not until about the last 100 pages that anything really happens that adds to the story line.It is too bad that this series has come to this. I would rather wait for a book that has been truly written with some sense of passion rather that receive the publisher's cash cow on a schedule.I think I am done with the Harry Potter series. It was fun while it lasted."
3,One of the best books I've ever read.,This book is an amazing book about a 15-year old boy who goes to a wizarding school. Strange thigs are happening this year. Why aren't his frends telling him what's going on? Why are there other wizards taking him somewhere he doesn't even know about? Why is he having strange dreams in the middle of the night? Why are one of those dreams about a dark corridor that he doesn't understand? What is the weapon Voldemort wants that can possibly be any worse than the Avada Kendavra curse? Find out in this exciting novel written by J. K. Rowling.
5,Better than I had Dared to Hope ...,"This is an engrossing book filled with magical stuff from Harry's world that will satisfy all readers, and a dark and complex plot that will keep you rushing through the pages and yearning for the sixth book at the end. I stayed up till 5am on June 22nd, completely unaware of the time as I read, imagining myself joining Harry and gang in their exploits, meeting Grawp, hoping against hope that Ron will eventually save a goal, sitting through the O.W.L.s, sharing Harry's excitement and horror in his dreams and fighting the Dark Lord's Death Eaters."
5,Great So Far,"Ive gotten about 100 pages in, and so far i love it. Whats crazy about it is that i kind of feel like harry reading for some time..i feel the frusteration..to find out what i am talking about you will have to read on. Otherwise the book is great, it is dark and funny at the same time, but holds that Harry Potter addiction in it. Of course you have to get this. My review is small but just because i cant spoil anything and because i still have some reading to do..Enjoy"
3,Could have been better,"I was so excited to have received the 5th Harry Potter book 20 minutes after midnight. I could not wait to read it. During the duration of my reading I was surprised to find many of the characters were not acting as they had in the previous books. I was glad that I did read this book, but I was somewhat unhappy with my findings. I do wish everyone to read it."
5,new potter book somber but good,"I finished this about 5 this morning, and i have to say that I found it rather glum. DO NOT missunderstand me this book is fantastic, Rowling's writing brings out a flood of emotions, and keept me spellbound through all 850 some odd pages. This is a must read for everyone. Just don't expect a cheary feel good story, this is by far the darkest and scariest book in the series, but in my openion the best so far. My advice get it, read it, and reread it countless times, I know I will."
5,Harry potter and the order of the phoenix,This is a awesomely good seriesI love Harry potter my favorite character is Ron weasly he is awesome I love the weaslys
2,Harry Potter 5,"This book wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It seems as though Rowling is losing her touch. I don't think it was as good as any of the others. The storyline was too spaced apart and they didn't flow very well. It was a really long book and gave me no new information, except the part about why Voldemort was trying to kill Harry in the first place. There are too many new characters introduced and too many old ones brought back into the story. In truth, I believe it is not worth reading."
2,Not impressed,"I was expecting more after waiting this long. Harry Potter fans will of course like it, but I think everyone is left with a feeling of being cheated. The story really didn't advance any, and all the hype about huge revelations was nothing more than the same thing rehashed. Hopefully we'll learn some more in 6 and 7. Serious let-down."
2,JK Rowling Please Use a Time Turner to...,"...go back, back back in time, If only this device were available, she could take her enviable writing talent and rewrite what is surely the dullest book in the series. As part of the continuation of the Series, this is a must read but what a chore! We learn so little and it seems so unfair to have waited so long for a very mediocre book considering the high standards she has set up for herself."
2,could have been better,"I thought that J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job writing all of her books except the fifth one. The fifth one was sad, depressing and I thought that there could have been a better climax to the ending than what she had written. She had written throughout the first four about this boy who's life was changed and his adventures at hogwarts. The fourth book was so good i expected a better sequal than what was published. J.K. Rowling just had a minor set back, and I still love the all the books. I can't wait till the sixth one comes out!!"
5,Great Storyteller,"No wonder why Jim Dale won the 2000 Grammy Award for the wonderful work he has done delivering the Harry Potter series to his audience. He is such a good storyteller; he is natural at it.Listening, and following along, to ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" has been a very great treat. I have enjoyed every voice that Mr. Dale has made for each character in ""The Order of the Phoenix."""
5,What a great read,After waiting 3 yrs for this book I can honestly say the wait was worth it. I finished the book in 10 hrs & enjoyed every minute. While the story is darker than the previous 4 it does have some lighter moments thanks to the Weasley twins. The much talked about death in the books happens near the end which makes the reader turn the pages all that faster (won't reveal who it is). There are some questions that will have to be answered in the upcoming books & hopefully we won't have to wait another 3 yrs. All-in-all a very good read.
2,Tale of two misfits...,"Potter got away with everything, won everything and received adulation from everyone --- but the Phoenix changed that.Of course, suspending belief is essential to understanding the story. Adults have no sense and only the Potter gangsters can bring salvation. Perhaps Professor McMonagall should be taking lessons from Potter...Cast:Voldemort - ""I alone shall bask in glory and power.""Dumbledore - ""Tom, get a grip.""Potter - ""I don't care!""In a world of Fudged reality, Weasley chaos and Looney beliefs, Potter finally becomes possessed and Dumbledore does a Lord of the Rings dance with Tom at the end. Snooping is the key to heroism, according to Potter Inc., and as the tale of two misfits continues, either Harry or Tom will crack, for neither can live while the other hexes."
3,Not as good as 3 or 4,"While the book provides an opportunity to spend a few hours re-living Harry's life. It isn't a great read. Much of the story refers back to previous books or foreshadows items that we hope will be resolved in books 6 & 7. This story doesn't leave the reader at the edge of their seat, it is much more predictable. I would recommend it to Potter fans as it gives you tidbits of hopefully 2 better books to come..."
4,Glad I Got 2 Copies So I Could Read 1: Worth the Wait,"This long-awaited fifth installment of the HP story adds additional depth and complexity to many of the main characters, bringing faults and histories to the surface to complement their struggles and virtues. ""Goblet of Fire"" (Book 4) had a more direct story line with the linear elements of the Triwizard Tournament, but ""Order of the Phoenix"" (Book 5) has vivid visual events and new aspects of more involved relationships. Harry, Dumbledore, Sirius, and other main characters aren't as perfect and the answers aren't as clean. My only qualm is that there isn't as much complexity in He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's game plan as I would have expected so far...but it does leave me looking forward to Book 6....and to continued debates with my 7 and 9 year olds about their perspectives on the world of HP. This continues to be a series of books to bring together the whole family. (So I'm glad I bought two copies, or I would be waiting a month to get my turn!)"
5,Truly Amazing,"I must say J.K. Rowling did such an excellent job with the 5th book of the series, Harry Potter : Order of the Phoenix. For three years of waiting for the release, the anticipation was well worth it. I was unable to refrain myself sometimes to put the book down. I think in this book we begin to see Harry growing up quite a bit, even if you do not come to realize it at first. The new charachters entering the novel have made the plot even more interesting. I have to say, at the end of the novel I was in tears, of joy and yet utter saddness. I fully recommend reading this book, you won't be able to stop turing the pages until you have reached the other cover."
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"The fifth installment in the Harry Potter saga has certain high points, the comically evil character of Professor Umbridge for one, but far too many low points. Although clearly the longest installment in Harry's life at Hogwarts, and maybe because it was the longest, this book is, in my opinion, the weakest of the five. The climatic scene was determinedly similar to the first book. Many other elements and plot devices found in Order of the Phoenix also seemed to be cobbled together from the earlier books as well. Also, athough Harry has been put through the mill so many times, I can understand him having a bad attitude, if he continues to dwell on his misfortunes, his bitterness will make him downright unlikeable by the seventh book. Hears hopeing Rowling picks it up a notch in book six."
4,The most suspenseful book in the Harry Potter series,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thrilling from beginning to end.I literally could not put it down because of the suspense of what would happen next.This book is full of many important revelations. It is an intense journey in which Harry must face many adult issues.The tone of the book is much more serious then in the previous books.It ends with a startling climax in which one of my favorite characters dies.Although this book will leave you depressed for days it is a must-read for all Harry Potter fans.
1,Harry Potter is Stupid!!!,"Yeah, I called the entire Harry Potter series stupid. Even the movie that recently came out was the dumbest thing there ever was. I hate to see people engrossing themselves into these books about witchcraft, heathens, and a nerdy boy with a bowl cut, Pepsi bottle glasses, wears black dresses, fights with a stick, and goes to a school named Hogwarts. Wow the name of that place would sure look good on a job application. Now how pathetic is that. This little weakling fights monsters with a stick. Oh no the monster might get a splinter, that you know, might get infected. Why doesn't Harry carry a gun, probably because he lacks the upper body strength to even fire a bb gun. Come on now people read something with a little sense in it. Read something about realistic people and realistic situations, and quit reading about freaks and magic."
1,0 stars,this book is efinetly boring. Also the trextr is enlarged so you ca nread the whole thing ain a few hours and they can sell the books for a higher price. There is no poot and I copuldn't care less about the characters. It is entrely predictable and notyhing really happens. It should be skipped.
1,"Harry Potter encourages kids to practice ""Witch Craft""","Harry Potter talks about a nerdy boy with glasses and some freaking scar on his head that is shaped as a lighting bolt. Heck!! why can't it be some other shape like an appleor a banana? Anyway, during the book, you encounter words like lumnos or somthing like that, which means to make thewand light up. Because of that, tons of kids are gonna buytoy wands and try to copy that. That is considered witch craft.They should ban Harry Potter from book stores. I don't evenlike the story at all. Why does Harry Potter have to be somenerdy geeky kid. It should be some cool chick like Jlo or something like that. LoL! Just kiddn. Anyway, I advise you not to buy the book. Its dumb, it has a bad story and brooms.Why don't they make mini coopers fly and use that for quiditch instead?DONT BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!"
5,excellent,"an excellent page turner, it is an extremely hard book to put down, a must read for any Harry Potter fan"
5,J.K. Rowlings strikes again,"Okay, let's admit it- the rush to get this book was far more exciting than the first hundred pages. But the once you left that part, things started picking up the pace.everything is a bit more darker than the previous books. but, the ending leaves you wanting more....."
2,Not Impressed,"When I read the new Harry Potter book, I was very exited to be one of the first people to read the new book. Sadly, the new book did not live up to its predicessors high standards. With the whopping 900, it just kept me bored until the eventual end. I was hardly impressed by the lack of depth that the book had, and the ending made me want to tear it to shreds, because I have just read all 900 pages with nothing good to yeald for my efforts, other than the ability to truthfully say that this book [stin]ks. I'm not going to tell you anything about the ending for those of you that don't read this review or don't heed it's advice. All that I tell you is that the ending is completely generic and unorigional and in no way leaves you satisfied after enduring the 900 pages of this boring book."
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix,It was the best book ever and very interesting. I really enjoyed reading this amazing novel by J.K.Rowling. I loved it
2,CANT GET THROUGH IT,"I was so excited when this came out, waiting in line at midnight...but once I started to read it, the excitement turned into a dull thud. I am finding it very hard to get through. Rowling is falling into the trap that Stephen King fell into, producing long, bloated books. I am reading the whole series aloud to my son and have noticed that upon reading them for the second time, they tend to drag. I think the problem is that Rowling is good at writing dialogue but not really good at the aura that makes children's literature so special like the CS Lewis series and ""Charlotte's Web"" which are filled with richness. I enjoy the books and her imagination but there is a lot of repetition. Harry is constantly getting into trouble and sometimes it's really tedious. I don't know how I will read Book 5 aloud. I was very disappointed in the dragging pages."
5,A Cool Book -- and not just for kids!,"Approaching this book as a teenager who enjoys the Harry Potter series I have to disagree with some of the most recent reviews on this site. I found the story to be very entertaining and I thought the characters were very believable. I would recommend this book to everyone! This one is my favorite! Other books I also like, the losers club by richard perez and the perks of being a wallflower -- which is also great!"
2,Tedium,"Having listened to the first four audiobooks, I was anxiously awaiting book 5. With the other books, I was disappointed when each got to the end, and have listened to all of them at least three times. This one was so tedious, with all of the incessant and unimportant detail, that I was actually relieved when it was finished and I packed all the tapes back in the box. The book could have been half the length and been twice as entertaining."
3,Harry Potter Book Purchase,This book was in good shape. However the book was depicted with a dust jacket and did not come with one.I would not have purchased it without one.I was very disappointed as this was a Christmas pressent.
2,"Book listed as new, but not so",I ordered this book as new to complete the others books I have for my son. This book is not brand new and even a few of the pages were dog eared. Very unhappy that I bought a book listed as new for a higher price when I could have bought a used book for a lot cheaper.
4,A Change . . . For The Better?,"I was quite surprised at how angsty this book seemed, compared to Goblet of Fire and the first three. Rowling's writing style has changed quite a bit since the last book! I haven't yet decided if it's a change for the better or worse, because it does take some getting used to.As usual, however, Rowling's plot is amazing. Angst aside, this is definitely one of the MUST-READ books of 2003. I have already signed up for book 6 (and will sign up for book 7) at my local bookstore!"
3,Condition,I expected a brand new book but there was damage to it I guess by the way they packaged it.
2,All hype and no substance!,"The latest Harry Potter book is merely O.K. The author follows a familiar formula dictated by her first four books and it's getting a little tiresome. If the book was half as long, it would be much better. In book 6, you need to ""cut to the chase,"" Ms. Rowling!"
3,Its not bad...i guess,"I dont know, I kinda agree with some of the other reviews here. I guess I was just expecting too much after such a long long long wait. Long wait. Maybe I was just disappointed by the fact that 870 pages went by really fast and now we have to wait again. It was a good story, I would definitely recommend everyone read it, but is it the best Potter book out? No way. Its the Phantom Menace of Harry Potter. It had to introduce lot of stuff for whats coming up later. Hopefully 6 and 7 will be out soon and make up for this one."
5,The BEST,J.K. Rowling just keeps getting better with each book. She grabs you from the first page and keeps building to the end. Her characters are rich with wonderfully complex relationships. Great action sequences. I love the way she continually ties the story together. Can't wait for the next one.
5,A magical adventure!,"I, like so many others waited in high anticipation for the arrival of my book last Saturday and I have to say I wasn't disappointed! I couldn't put it down. The characters which J.K Rowling creates simply fly of the page straight into your imagination.In this book we can certainly see the growth of Harry. Rowling manages to keep the character true to his age while having him experience such dramatic and unusual events. We can understand and sympathise with his frustrations.The tone of this book, as with ""The Goblet Of Fire,"" is distinctly dark and the ending leaves one in no doubt that the future of Harry Potter and his friends is going to be filled with danger and drama."
5,i read it in three days,"the newest harry potter book is without a doubt the darkest yet. it is also the longest yet. despite the length, i managed to read it in three days. i just couldn't put it down. the thing i like best about it is the fact that instead of being some sunshine and lollipops children's book, it really makes you think. in this book, harry is forced to reevaluate his opinions of many people in his life and must realise that people cannot always be easily classified as good or bad.overall, the book is worth a look as long as you are familiar with the series."
5,Darkest of the Lot,"Whew...finally finished this in a day. I found this much, much darker than the last four books. Harry is bitter, full of contempt. The first few chapters show him in a much different light that the other four. But in doing so, J.K Rowling could maybe capture readers who like such genres. The whole book was a rush, with a very satisfying conclusion. A must read."
5,*Harry*Potter*and*the*Order*of*the*Phoenix*ROX!*,"I read *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, and I LOVED it! It was the best book I've ever read! There were many sad parts, and unfortunately some mushy parts, but overall, it was a wonderful book. The saddest part was when someone (I'm not saying who!) dies. One of Harry's friends becomes keeper of the quiditch team, and a girl who was previously on the team is the captain. Harry learns a very important thing about Professor Trelawney, Lord Voldemort, Neville Longbottom, and himself. Neville plays a very important part in stopping Lord Voldemort, but Harry gets all the recognition.Overall, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is a wonderful book full of adventure, bravery, death, fighting and peace, friends and enemies, joining and separation. It is DEFINETLY my favorite *Harry Potter* books.This is what I would rate this book if I could:"
2,"Good story, lousy writing","Suffer through horrid writing to follow a great story.Rowling creates memorable characters and situations, but I really wish she'd buy a thesaurus and take a writing class. Every character ""beams"" at each other on every other page, and I don't even want to count the number of times I had to stop reading to figure out who was speaking. A grammar lesson wouldn't hurt her writing either. Maybe she could afford an editor now?I just get the feeling that she rushed these books tp press before she had a chance to polish the writing. (All Harry Potter books have these same problems, but I think the fifth book has the most.)"
3,Too much time for JK not enough for Editor,"JK took too much time with this one, and her Editor/Publisher, in a rush to get this out, didn't take enough time to edit this book. Over I all, I still liked the story, but it needed to be trimmed down. Great stuff with a lot of ""Blah Blah"" filling each paragraph. The upside is that most of the ""British"" speech seems to have been left in. When I first got a copy of the British verison, I was surprised to find many editorial changes. Like parking lot instead of ""car park"" and sweater instead of ""jumper"" etc. I don't really think they need to change that stuff anyway. If the author spells color as colour, why change it? I grew up reading books like the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" without these changes and still managed to understand what was being said. Spend more time trimming down dialogue and description. I am still looking foward to the next one, mostly because I hope it will be better. At least as great as the first four."
3,Here's hoping he grows out of it.,"J.K Rowling continues to cast a wonderful spell as the journey continues. But I disagree with the reviewers who see our Hero Harry's sudden change of temperament to that of a sullen, self absorbed and put-upon teenager as a good thing. Yes, it makes him a more realistic adolescent, but I get to deal with plenty of those in the real world. I would prefer to escape from that sort of realism in these adventures, and to spend the time they require with a hero as loveable as the one Ms. Rowling gave us in the first four books.Here's hoping he grows out of it!"
2,Not much happens,"This really is a filler novel. I guess Harry needs 1 year to grow up. The plot is a lot weaker than books 1,2,3 and 4 and the ending feels a bit rushed.I hope the next book is better.If you don't expect too much, you won't be disapointed."
5,SIMPLY MAGICAL,"Hi there this is bicky bird ""bix"" writing to tell you all about this ABSOLUTLY FABULOUS book i have just read! J.K you have done it again girl!The book i will be reviewing is Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix.By far this book is the best in the set! It's full of excitement, fun, laughter, horror and of course sadness. I can safely say that anyone who reads this book will enjoy it as much as i have! From reading this book you will have a ride of a lifetime, an emotional ride that is! Join the thousands maybe millions of Harry Potter fans worldwide and read this SIMPLY MAGICAL book. If you enjoyed the other four books you are sure to enjoy this one. As we all have come to expect J.K's books are amazing, astounding and just a great read, she doesnt disapoint in this book.I rate this book with a massive 5 stars!!!Keep the books coming!!!Thanks for taking time to read my review!!!"
3,Jo Rowling's Done It Again,"I have one word that should sum up Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix- brilliant! Just when you can't possibly imagine how the plot could get any better, Jo Rowling surprises us all! This book contains many unexpected twists, including a cryptic new prophecy explaining much of the mystery of the series, an impacting death, a horrible new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher that has it out for Harry, and a crazy house-elf named Kreacher. Rowling of course incorporates the ideas of the novel with a humorous and jocular tone making the book even more likeable!One word of caution: Once a reader begins to read this book, there is no stopping until the end!"
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"While the book was overall, fairly decent, it certainly wasn't the best of the bunch. Harry's constant yelling at everyone grew tiresome and does not make for a hero. Was J.K. Rowling going through constant PMS when she wrote it or what?What I liked about all the other books is at the beginning, something hilarious always happens at or to the Dursleys. This time, Dudley almost gets his soul sucked out by a Dementor at the beginning.If my kids were young, they most certainly would not be reading any of these books. I would say you should be at least 16 to read the latest one; it certainly isn't for 9 year olds."
2,Not Impressed,"When I read the new Harry Potter book, I was very exited to be one of the first people to read the new book. Sadly, the new book did not live up to its predicessors high standards. With the whopping 900, it just kept me bored until the eventual end. I was hardly impressed by the lack of depth that the book had, and the ending made me want to tear it to shreds, because I have just read all 900 pages with nothing good to yeald for my efforts, other than the ability to truthfully say that this book sucks. I'm not going to tell you anything about the ending for those of you that don't read this review or don't heed it's advice. All that I tell you is that the ending is completely generic and unorigional and in no way leaves you satisfied after enduring the 900 pages of this boring book."
2,Uninspired,"he biggest plus is the book is set the J.K.Rowling universe. Though at times it seems like a movie script - sets are paid way more attention than characters. There is no real character development and the dialogs are often repetative and boring as Harry himself points out (ohn the irony!). The book is not dark by any means, more confused ala teanager finding his place but in no means dark. The second book(CoS) is way darker than this one. The ending is the worst part - be prepared to be shocked by staggering dullness of the revalations. In many ways this is the anti book 4 - no new characters, no new spells, not much going on."
4,I couldn't put it down...,"A definite page-turner. Harry is darker and more complex in this novel than any other- Rowling digs deep! I won't give it away but I almost cried with disapointment at certain parts, but was thrilled when certain questions are answered at the end. Bring on book 6!"
5,Best Book EVER!!!,"If you were wondering which of the Harry Potter series would be equally thrilling and with loads of surprises, The Order of the Phoenix is the one.Packed with action, romance and even some mistery i couldn't put it down, read it and re-read it,and i think J.K.'s outdone herself. She's the best."
3,The other books are better,"Painfully slow beginning. I agree with the other person that wrote that the book basically goes on and on and we know nothing more than 'Voldemort is back'. Some parts are very good, but I think that easily 300 pages could have been cut and made a better book. Not bad, but not her best work. The good stuff doesn't come till the middle of the book, toward the end. At the prices out there for this book, it is worth picking up and reading at any rate. Just didn't 'suck me in' until toward the middle/end."
3,Not as good as book four but still good,"Since I absolutely loved book four of the series, I thought that this book would be twice as good and I was disappointed. While longer in length this book was missing some of the charm of the previous books. Harry is more angry then ever, he spends a large amount of time ranting and raving. All in all I still can't wait to see the movie rendition of this book."
5,Harry Potter Just Keeps Getting Better!!,"True to her hints, Rowling has written a much darker novel this time. The Order of the Phoenix signals a change in Harry and his life. He is older, but not necessarily wiser, and is a very typical teenager. Rather than write about a teen who is bypassed by puberty and all of the attendant woes, Rowling has chosen to confront girls, fame, anger, and the fact that Harry is starting to realize much more fully who he is and what he has to confront. While the overall tone of the book is dark, there are some very funny moments and Rowling is at the top of her form. And, Harry is not the only one who grows. More than the previous four books, this one works with an ensemble cast. In addition, Harry's actions have much more far-reaching consequences. Harry and his friends are coming into their own and we are priviledged to be able to watch them."
4,kids advice,This book is a really good book but also it has a few bad words so before your kid reads this book i would take some bad words out maybe with a sharpie marker or something otherwise its a terrific book
5,Amazing Book,The Order of the Phoenix so far is the vest of all just the saddest of Sirius's FateGo JK Rowling!_
5,The magical tale,"If you like giants, goblins, wizards, mischievous house elves and a pinch of action and magic, then Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix by: J.K. Rowling is the book to read."
4,I couldn't put it down.,"I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan, and I read this one in three days, all 896 pages. I liked this book better than the last one. The action starts right away, and there are lots of the imaginative details that make these books so great. Fred and George provide comic relief, and as a teacher, I got a big kick out of her portrayal of Umbridge as the teacher/ administrator from hell. It's interesting to watch Harry mature, although his self-absorption did get to me at some points. The past few books are referenced often, and I sometimes had trouble remembering all of the details. (It's been a while since I read them.) Anyway, it's a great read, and I can't wait for the next one"
2,"sadly, not worth it.","This book was ok... but it was long, and it seemed pointless. The big finish with Voldemort hardly seemed worth reading, and the prophecy was something everyone pretty much already new- one or the other is going to die. I felt very let down my this book, in the end- a lot of horrible things happened, conflict after conflict, with no real resolutions except Dumbledore's rap up conversation with harry. And the lack of depth spent on the death of one of the best characters in the book was just saddening.Harry is angsty to the max in this novel, which seems rather forced- none of the characters are high in depth anyway, so giving harry a major dose of teen angst just seems odd.After reading this book I just felt very let down and empty, instead of the usual happy feeling I get after reading a HP book. It seems Rowling had a lot to say but didn't quite cover it in her regular fashion- which led to a lengthy novel which covers a great deal but doesn't say much important."
3,Good,"This was a good book, but not as good as the last four. It did not leave me wanting more; it just left me depressed for a bit. It was fun to read, but there were a lot of downs and not many ups. Worth getting, but perhaps one should wait for the paperback..."
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,For those of you who have children or teenagers I would advise against this book. JK Rowling has written a book that will drag you through unbelievable foolish depression and out the other side. I hope her desire for depression diminishes and she gets the antidepressants she needs. This book though well written lacks any real heart and I spent more time being irritated by it than enjoying it. The previous books had merit but the further she goes the more not dark but stupid she gets. I am unfortunately stuck until the end. If the books continue to digress I will be glad for them to end. I do hope JK can turn things around.
2,Rowling on vacation while writing???,"Last year I read all the Harry Potter books, since my kids wanted to. I was captivated. So naturally I was excited when I heard about the 5th. Boy was I WRONG. I skipped pages out of pure boredom. The book was poorly written compared to the others. I say yes it is worth readingifyouve read the others. BUT this book has mademeless excited about Harry Potter andwhat becomes of him."
1,It didn't worth my time,"The fifth part of Mrs. Rowling's epic clearly shows that there is no magic wand to write a good book. The entire novel appears to be under the Crouch Spell -[...]through the countless pages of the incredibly tedious revelations, the wonderfully silly battles and the unbelievably empty dialogs has been a real pain[...]. Now there is no mystery why the first person who has read the book did so in mere 90 minutes: this just gives you an idea about how many of nearly 900 pages are actually worth your time."
1,When will Harry realize...,... that six kids cannot take on 10 death eaters?? Hello??!! What is this The Goonies??... that he can trust Dumbledor explicitly??And when will Rowling realize that having absolutely nothing happen for the first 400 pages is idiotic? I kept getting closer to the middle of the book wondering when it was going to start. There's no way I can read this to my kids!! Snore!!
1,Harry Potter 5,It was bad because they made Harry into someone you like in 4. Then all of a sudden he is this mean gangly teenager that totally makes you want to kill him. And why did Serious die? What did it do for the plot?
4,I like harry potter,"but i cant heop but agree he is tooo negative and sasd all the time. I believe he should have some fun in his life or why would he struggle so hard to be better? There has to be some driving force in Harry that is not a need for vengence, because:1 Its a childrens book2 That would be to obvious and simple3 It gets boring with harry being so sad.Heros arent sad."
5,WOOOOW! The best one yet!,"I just wanna let you know, that unfortunately for me, I've finished the book. It's amazing how good it is, cause today is June 21 and I've had this book in my hands for less than a day.I'll have to wait God knows how many years to read the next installment.It's scary, funny and human!The author is a genius and beware... there are a LOT of surprises, one MAJOR death... fights, YOU KNOW WHO,etc.The ending is a major cliffhanger and I cannot believe it yet.BUY IT NOW"
5,The Best One Yet!,"There were occasions today that I had no choice but to put the book down. As brief as these moments were, I was barely able to withstand the separation. When you read this book, you will not feel like you are reading words on paper; you will feel as though you are experiencing an adventure. It is an adventure that will leave you breathless and exhilirated. ..."
5,A worthy sequel,"I've been a big Harry Potter fan for quite some time and have eagerly waiting for Order of the Phoenix to come out. I wasn't disappointed. Although the book is almost 900 pages long, Rowling still manages to keep the reader interesting by colorful characters, plot twists, and dashes of humor to lighten up the overall dark tone of the book. I won't give any plot details away but I will say that Rowling included one nasty surprise towards the end... I highly recommend this book for its easy to read prose, imaginitive setting, and characters that any child or anyone with the heart of one can relate to."
3,Disappointed,"Well, I do wish I can say it was great, but it wasn't. Must have been one of the worst books in the Harry Potter Series. J. K. Rowling still delivers a great show of wizardry wonders as witty as ever, but the plot was too weak. The plot was unlogical and sometimes absurd and contradicting. The twists were foreseeable. It just couldn't give me the sense of excitement the prior books gave me. Of course, buy it, read it, but don't get your expectations too high."
5,Great!,"I am already on page 352 and I love it! I went to Books a million last night at midnight to get it, and it was well worth the wait!P.S.:WHEN IT SAYS ""PHEONIX"" in the title, surprisingly, the book is NOT about a pheonix is is about a g................"
5,She's done it...again!,"This book is equal with, and quite possibly transcends, JK Rowling's previous novels. It is a very different tale in many respects, and, I'm forced to admit, rather depressing, but that should not affect your enjoyment of this book rather than your growing empathy for Harry himself. In this book you explore locations Harry has not previously visited, such as the Ministry of Magic and the Hog's Head pub, and gain further insight into matters Rowling has not previously shed much light on, such as prophecies and the Department of Mysteries. Altogether, you will race through these pages, and there are many, like you would with any other Harry Potter book, up to its breathtaking conclusion, which will, at the very least, take your breath away. Without ruining anything else, allow me to offer one helpful bit of advice: READ IT."
5,It's Harry Potter - gotta get it!,"Ok, since I got the book, I have read nonstop. I, like a gazzilion others, have waited soooooo long, couldn't help myself.I was waiting for the happy mystical adventure the other books held, but it's much darker than the others. Harry is in the midst of teenage years and it seems constant PMS - One of the charms of the other books has been the chemistry between HP and Dumbledore, and Hagrid, and others - Yes, a major character dies, and that is a turning point - this book answers many of the questions we have asked ourselves - from why Harry has to stay at the Dursley's to what is truly going on in regard to the 'legend' of the return of Voldemort and the battle to defeat the evil forces - it is fascinating and worth wading thru the angst and angst and angst...For charm, go back to HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban - for answers to your questions, read this one -"
4,Rowling pens another winner,"Rowling's characters have progressed into their teen years, including the moodiness and insecurity that comes with this age. Harry Potter is not so lovable, but is more credible as a real person because of it. Apart from one tedious chapter near the beginning which seems to serve no purpose other than to invent several new magical creatures, the book is thoroughly engrossing. You won't be able to put it down after the first few chapters. You'll be sucked into the wizarding world once again, cheering for Gryffindor and wanting to strangle the newest character, Professor Umbridge, who is as nasty a villain as you're likely to read of. I'm glad more humor has returned to Rowling's writing. Kids will howl with laughter at Fred and George's antics. This book is more child-friendly than the last one, which was too dark for me to read to my 7-year old (who loved the first 3 books)."
3,The only low point in the series,"I love this series, It's so imaginative & inspiring. That's why I was so disappointed with the petulant tone of this installment. If you only read one Harry Potter novel, PLEASE don't let it be this one. They're so good, it would be a shame to see the whole series measured by this book. With that said, it's still good. Harry's attitude just set me on edge- he's been underestimated throughout the series, why is he lashing out NOW & why is he setting such a surly example for readers? *sigh* just get through this one quickly enough that you can follow the plot lines through to Half-Blood Prince."
2,Definitely not for kids,"While I like all the books so far (1-5), the last two installments are just too dark and scary and gory for kids. Volume 5 includes:1.Instant death curse2.Pain-inflicting curses3.Eye-gauging and/or mutilation (twice, one voluntarily)4.The death of one of the good guys5.Vandalism at school (fireworks, magic swamp, etc)6.Rebellion at school7.Tortures (magical pen, spells)8.Furniture smashingI bet younger kids will have nightmare if they read those parts. I don't recommend these two books (4&5) for kids. Keep these two books for yourself until they are at least 13."
2,Not evan as good as the fan fiction,"This latest installment was not as good as the fan fiction out there, such as that on the web by Cassandra Claire. Google is your friend. Her fiction is imaginative and the depth of characters is incredible. I would willingly pay $50 for each of her THREE novel-length books put out just after the fourth official Potter book. I enjoyed the Potter books by Rowling, but I find the fan-fiction far more enjoyable."
3,OK but not great,"Rowling appears to be rushing through these...there are few surprises here. In a book this thick, I expect to have some new insight or revelation about at least one of the characters. That doesn't happen; it could easily have been half the length. There's nothing wrong with my attention span--I can read a long book, as long as there's enough story there to justify the length. This isn't the case here."
2,Fair to partly cloudy,"Is Harry EVER going to wise up? Why does he keep making the oh so foolish mistakes, he makes? Well, book 5 still keeps him pumping along, doing the dumb things that make him a hero in the end; causing no end of trouble for those who try to guide him. When are the people in charge, going to tell Harry what is going on? Dumbledore is a well developed character with a lot of depth. His talk with Harry at the end of the book is quite disheartening. The main backbone of this book becomes a puddle and we, the readers, still are nearly as in the dark as before."
1,ok...,"First of all, I am not anti-Harry Potter. But lets face it, isn't J.K Rowling over doing it? I read the first book, skimmed the second and read some of the third. What more can I say? She is definatly a good writer--but not nearly as great as she is made out to be. I wonder how many pages of this book could be eliminated. Plus, every book needs detail- otherwise whats the point of reading the book? But isn't there something known as too much detail? We do not need to know the scientific name of everything in the room- some stuff has to be left for our imaginations. And what about all the other stuff- movies, toys, EVEN BACKPACKS! i mean...dont just go by what everyone else thinks about Harry Potter. Why not spend your time reading a good book--AMAZING book by someone like Agatha Cristie? Someone who knows how to stick to a topic and further develop a plot into a real, one of a kind mystery."
3,A step back from Goblet of Fire,"HPAOP moves more slowly than the last 2 volumes of the series. As usual, we get a lot of side plots, not many of them really interesting. Also, the main plot seems to have been somewhat neglected this time. We get a lot of school politics, not much of everything else.Not only that, but I felt that the main arc of the series as a whole didn't advance much. Not really many new relevant information , or surprising either.It was a pleasant read, mind you. Still better than the first two volumes, but certainly not as good as the last two, simply because the book got to big and felt empty compared to those two."
2,WAS THIS A COLLECTION OF ROWLING'S REJECT PAGES?,"There is little magic to this book literally. It dwells on insignificant character development and degrades your favorite characters to unlikeable levels. No new clever plots or creative items to satisfy your imagination. This story could have been reduced to one chapter to a much better adventure, instead it leaves you no further than the last book, he doesn't even really advance in school. Those who loved this book obviously are fans to the bitter end and can look past a lackluster story. Rowling is an amazing author and we should expect more from her."
2,Getting worse,"For a book with over 700 pages, not a lot actually happened. Like most of the recent books in the series, this one could easily have been trimmed down to 300 pages or less without losing anything important. People are so hooked on Harry Potter, they will buy it and think it's the greatest book ever even if the plot is drowned in pages and pages of pointless waffle.There are a few good points. Umbridge is a great villain, and there is an amusing joke about complementary medicine. Other than that, and the battle at the end which seems to be the only thing that actually advances the plot, it's all filler.I've been hoping that book 7 will be as neat and to-the-point as the first two, which are easily the best, but after reading this and hbp I have a feeling it's going to be another giant slab."
4,Is this the Fate of all series?,"This last book was needlessly long; Rowling could have easily slashed at least one third. Harry potter was walking around in a snit for 94% of the book, and I wanted to say get over yourself already, why don't you? The book was filled with some major doom and gloom elements that depressed rather than enticed. I did not get the sense of euphoria that I got from the last 4 books, but I guess since we have 2 more books to read there is not much choice for us die hard fans. One good thing is that in the last 250 pages Rowling pulls through and she shows us that she is there to fascinate as we knew she could. ..."
5,Best One Yet.,"In my opinion, this one has a slight edge over Azkaban (Book 3), for the top spot. You get to see a new side of Harry, and more of him as a real person. in this book you get to see Harry angry, confused, and depressed, rather than the more happy and jolly other books. But, for some reason, I still find the second one to be the darkest in the series. This is a must read that will keep you guessing, and jumping to conclusions, which are always twisted into something unexpected."
5,Best yet,"This is surely the best one so far. I have never wanted to kill a fictional character, but if I could get my hands on Profesor Umbridge I'd do just that. Well done Ms Rowling, great story telling! I particularly like the way the story paralells recent world events, with President Bush as Dumbledor, Profesor Umbridge and the Ministry of Magic as the Axis of Evil and the Daily Prophet as the left wing media. This will show our children how evil is spread through the media and how we must fight to stop it."
3,Underwhelmed by the book,"I am not sure whether I was underwhelmed by the book or simply expected too much.As a father, I have pre-read each Potter book before reading them to my girls. The first three novels were excellent. The fourth, though somewhat bloated, managed to make me want to turn the page.During the couple of days it took to read Order of the Phoenix, the thought kept recurring that there was nothing very compelling. The book seemed to lack direction. It was as if I just read 500 pages of pure exposition. I was reading filler!And the death of a major character (I won't specify) was a waste. Neither heroic or required, it rang both false and useless.I am no editor, but this book screams for a good one. I suspect it could have been editted down by a couple of hundred pages and been as good or better than some of the earlier novels. The ideas are apparent. They are not well developed or executed."
4,For fun,"What more could one possibly say about Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling? The books are delightful, pure entertainment for intelligent children and adults. That alone is remarkable. If anyone sees evil in Harry Potter, that person has a serious personality flaw in my view. We read fiction for fun, for the magic of it, no matter how intellectual we may get in describing a work. If it ain't fun, if it doesn't transport us, then it ain't worth it. Harry Potter is fun.I hesitate to add that the latest installment is perhaps a bit too long by some 200 pages. A good editor could have fixed that easily. It took too long to get to Hogwarts, where I long to be. I tolerate the other places. Other than that, I loved it."
2,Two Words: Character Development,"I find myself very disappointed with the latest installment of the Harry Potter collection, ""Order of the Phoenix"". Being the 5th book, and thus the 5th year, since we first met young Harry Potter, I would have expected to find him 5 years older. On the contrary, the Harry Potter in ""Order of the Phoenix"" seems to have regressed in maturity, and his prepubescent charm has worn thin. Likewise, none of Harry chums seems to have been developed either, and there flat characters are no more than contrived vehicles for advancing the predictable and wearisome plot. An otherwise great concept was unrealized and clouded by numerous pages of fluff and useless rhetoric. I can only surmise that Ms. Rowling was rushed to get this book to press, and I am sorry I paid full-price for what I'm sure would have earned a T from the Hogwarts staff. Please resubmit when you have corrected your mistakes..."
5,Amazing-just amazing,"... Answer this-if your parents were unfairly murdered when you were a baby, yet you survived when you don't know why, and now the murderer is back and he has got it in for you, you don't know what he is doing, you were tortured and had to watch someone die last year, plus nobody believes you and publicly slanders you, noone understands, and also your 'girlfriend' brings last year up and then cries when you dont want to talk about it. Wouldnt you be angry? I think you would. This is a great book and Rowling is just describing what every teen goes through at this age, only of course it is worse. It is still a book you can escape to, but that doesnt mean it has to be happy, jolly, and simple."
3,"Not the best, but still a good part of a great story.","My first thought on finishing was that this book could have used a good edit. It was pretty disappointing after the fine book that The Goblet of Fire was. That said, I did enjoy the ""Order of the Phoenix"" concept and the new charachters - especially Tonks and Luna. Harry's charachter development is coming along nicely, but some of the others seem to have stalled."
3,Very stressfull to say the least,"Each book was better than the last, except book 5. I rate it a 3, all others being varying degrees of 5. Never ending stress dolled out for 700 pages. It makes me think that the author has had experiences with some really foul human beings. Most of the other books had highs and lows thoughout the book. Nothing but low, lower, and lowest, with the lowest being the climax! Do I recommed the read, yes, but only to hopely prepare for better book, #6 and #7. I am sure that some like minded thoughts will make it back to the author."
4,Great sequel!,"This book is better than #4! I loved the fact that Harry is finally becoming quite the jerky and typical teenager to not just his enemies but also to his friends. This is a normal fact of life, and it's finally happening to the famous Harry Potter.There is also the fact that he found his father not to be the ""saint"" that he thought he was (besides sneaking out of school). If Harry's parents were perfect, that would be quite boring. Thanks, Rowling.The plot of the story was the only thing that was the problem. It was too...uneventful, although there were good sequences of events before the final showdown in the book. It had a great ending that left me wanting to read that sixth book right then."
4,"Long, perhaps too long for children","Harry goes all 'Adrian Mole' here and this near 900 page tome may well be too much for the younger readers.That said, I'm 30 and thought it was a cracking read. Good to see Harry's range of emotions and his relationships with his friends developing much more than the previous books."
3,I hope the next one is better!,"This book was much more depressing then the other four. I think maybe the writer was under alot of pressure to finish it, and it really wasnt quite what i was expecting. All i can say is that i hope the next ones better!"
3,Its okay.,"I really like this book but it is too sad. I DON'T WANT SIRIUS TO DIE!!!! I'll never forget how angry I was with J.K. Rowling. Why can't Harry EVER have a happy life? I mean, shouldn't he get a break?!?!"
4,A warning for our times,"The Order of the Phoenix continues where the Goblet of Fire left off. The tone is once again darker, bordering on the horrific (eg. Harry's punishment of 'writing lines'). It is another excellent story: long, without the slow parts of the Goblet of Fire, but without that story's terrifying climax.Much of the book is Harry feeling frustrated by the willingness of people to close their eyes to the evidence of Voldemort's return. Instead Harry is branded as a publicity seeker and trouble maker. Although almost certainly not intended by J.K. Rowling, I find this to be a curious parallel to today's world where so many have their eyes shut to the dangers of islamofascism."
4,"Alas, she has lost it...","While the other Harry Potter books would be rated 6 stars out of five by me, the latest, most hyped Harry Potter book would deserve 4 only.As much as die-hard POtter fans claim this is the best book, c'mon, this one was so very expected and boring. Compared to the 2nd and 3rd books which were masterpieces, the fifth book of Harry Potter is like a normal book unlike its extraordinary predessesors.It is worth the money you pay for it but definately not worth the hype it got.Best in the series so far is still the third book.You can also assume from the mood of the entire book that J.K.Rowling wrote this one just for the sake of writing and she also tries too hard, you can see, to bring in as much humour as possible.I hope her sixth book will be better."
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix-My Review,"I thought this was the best book yet. J.K.'s latest masterpiece really left me on my toes(not literally). I thought it was a little slow at the biginning, but really picked up speed as I progressed. If you're to bored w/ other books, pick this one up. You won't regret it."
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"I personally enjoyed this book for multiple reasons. For one, the plot is easy to follow if you pay attention to whats going on. Also, I feel that J.K. Rowling had a smart idea as to having Albus Dumbledore make a mistake, mainly because, over the first four books, he earns the image of an elderly man who has never made a mistake in his entire life. although, I feel that having my favorite charactor die was a very cruel thing to do. This book has great word choices and surprising new twists that you never would have thought possible. I would recommend this book to all who can read long novels, for I throughly enjoyed it."
4,Not bad... but not as entertaining as the others,"I just finished the book tonight and while I found it interesting, I didn't love it. Harry's turned 15 and he's turned into a slightly whiny kid with somewhat of a chip on his shoulder. Ron and Hermione don't seem to suffer the same age-related issues. Every once and a while it seems Harry's about to step out of his self-pity and return to himself but then he drops into it again. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the book and it did advance quite a few characters, I just didn't enjoy it as much as the others. I know it's a dark time but this installment just didn't seem to have ANY of the lightness or joy on the part of the characters that the others did- something I felt made them more interesting and appealing when the going got rough in previous books. I didn't even feel that sad when one of the characters died (not a surprise since it was all over the news.) I just didn't feel that connected this time around."
5,The Magic Continues,"The long wait for HP5 was definitely worthwhile, with author JK Rowling blessing us with another creative outpouring of new characters and new magical situations to entrance and delight us from cover to cover.Although Harry and his friends are now definitely young adults rather than children, the book remains suitable for children of all ages. A recent study suggested that more than half of all HP readers are aged over 35, and 25% are aged over 55) so, if like me, you're young at heart but not in calendar years, you can still admit, without embarrassment, to enjoying this and the other books in this 7 book series."
5,One of the best books!,"I re-read all the HP books, and this one is my favorite so far. The best part is the the Weasly brothers final moments in Hogwart's history. The death is really sad, because the charecter was well-liked, so you will be crying a bit. I won't tell you any more, but that this is one of the best books in the series."
4,Spell has broken a bit,"It's still a good read...but petulant Harry's no longer quite so lovable, the book is too long for the amount of plot, and most of the characters we've come to know and love just seem to be making token appearances.It's a bit more realistic portrayal of a teenage boy...but who said I was reading this series for realism? I'll keep reading, but I'm not waiting anxiously for #6."
2,Harry Potter Going to the Pot,"There is one reason why this book will not become classified as Classic Literature that will be studied and read throughout time. That is that the book is too transparent. The Harry Potter Series takes too liberally from other classic tales (Lord of the Rings is the highest example), and doesn't create enough of its own charisma to hold its own. They are fascinating, and adventurous tales, and, yes, the very idea of originality is to take and borrow great things to create something entirely new. Something which more and more of the Harry Potter books lack. I am glad to see children, even older adults, reading these tales. But I would hope that they don't expect all books to be as easy and non-descript as these as they delve further into the vaults of Classic Literature. Let's face it, the Series cannot match such books as Ben Hur, Huckleberry Finn, or Sherlock Holmes, to name a few."
2,Takes too long to say too little,"As an avid fan of Rowling's earlier works, I eagerly pre-ordered my copy of the Order of the Phoenix. Regrettably, Ms. Rowling seems to have ran out of Potter material. The author thrashes about for over 700 pages, desperately trying to find some sort of cohesive plot. Finally, at the 11th hour she begins to actually write about something other than Harry shouting at his friends and ends up with a story which is disjointed at best, ill conceived at worst. It's evident the author mailed this one in - her heart doesn't seem to be in in. Perhaps the wealth and fame have gotten to her or she's simply ran out of story for the Potter saga."
3,Frustrating,"I started out deliberately ignoring the Harry Potter phenomenon, until I went to see the first movie with my wife and her (then) 6 year old daughter. We absolutely loved it, and after that we devoured the first 4 books, taking turns reading to each other. We loved the imagination, the humor and everything else. And naturally we pre-ordered this one from Amazon.But we both felt frustrated with this 5th installment. There was some of the humor, the plot wasn't bad and it was generally ok. But we really did not like this emotional, whiny, angry brat that used to be Harry Potter. Now I understand he's supposed to be a teenager, but really, this is way over the top. And all the elements that made the other books such ""magical"" experiences, just were not on the same level.Some reviewers suggested rereading the book several times to appreciate it. Now I have to ask, how empty is your life if you have time to read a 800+ page book more than once?My two cents."
5,Just when you think you know whats next,"J.K. Rowling invokes all the emotions in the 5th book of the 5th year student of Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizadry. On top of fulfilling every kids dream of rebeling against an evil athourity and adolesent rage, readers will laugh, cry, and feel a great lose and pride on completion of this book."
3,Harry Potter- doesn't quite live up to its predecessors,"I believe that, although entertaining, this book does not equal the other four. Firstly, Harry is angry throughout the book, and it gets kinda old. I know 15-year olds are often moody, but it is a bit depressing. Second, Voldemort is a weak, undeveloped villain. Rowling needs to explain his past and why he ""went bad"". No one just says ""Oh, I think I'll be an evil wizard and kill people- Muahahaha!"" Hermione is (and has been) always so smart and perfect, which is almost impossible, and maddening. I also think that Rowling feels pressured to make her books longer and longer. This was a good book, but it has plenty of room for improvement."
1,Where do I begin...,"I have read every book in this series and was waiting for the 5 book. I was excited...now I'm disapponted...and my wallet is 40 bucks lighter. This book could have been 400 pages shorter if they cut out all of the ers, mms, and hmmms. Come on. I'm 15 and i don't mumble and crap myself when I talk to a girl. Voldemort's ""plan"" was mediocore at best and I'm still trying to find out what the point of this book was. Besides to kill off the only good charecter. All in all this book ranks way up there with Robert Jordan's recent work. If you want to read it I'ld have to say check it out of the library or wait for the paper back version. Maybe by that time they would have edited it."
5,No Spoilers Here - Review of Order of the Phoenix,"A worthy successor to the previous 4 novels.Lots of teenage angst, clever plot twists, and purposeful misdirection by Rowling. The book is equally dark in tone to Goblet of fire (so don't be surprized).Colorful background information is introduced for some of the secondary characters. Can't be more specific, but these flashbacks were unexpectedly disturbing. Good job, J.K.Read it quickly before someone at Time or USA Today decides to publish spoilers and ruin the ending!"
5,excellent,"Excellent coming of age wizardry story, although not quite as enjoyable as #4 simply because its such a dark tale with lots of conflicting emotions and disillusionments about the heroes of the story. Leaves you eagerly awaiting the next."
4,"Good, but a little too long","This book had really good parts where you couldn't put it down and then there were other parts that just dragged. I personally would have cut out about 100 pages if I were the editor. As a whole, book 5 is not as good as its predecessors (the beginning's pretty shake-y), but it's definitely worth reading and most of the questions that have been raised over the course of the last four books are finally answered!"
4,Pretty Darn Good!!!,"I really like this book. It was sort of confusing, but altogether great! I didnt like that one of my favorite characters died. :( But overall, it was Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Would recieve an Outstanding from the O.W.L.s,"I just finished Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and it is, in my opinion, by far the best of the series. I loved (rather obsessed over) the Goblet of Fire and its prequels, but Order of the Phoenix was on a different level. The book had a good balance of comedy, teenage drama, and deep emotion. It had its silly moments, witch were still exceptionally entertaining, but there were more serious events throughout this volume than in any of the others. The book managed to provide a powerful moral while still leaving an ominous cliffhanger for the sixth book. The Order of the Phoenix provides readers with quivering fear, tearful eyes, and lighthearted laughter that left me feeling an incredible amount of admiration for JK Rowling. Her books are so special; I don't know what I'd do without them."
5,Harry Potter 5- as good as the rest of the series?,"I was indeed one of those people who waited until midnight at a bookstore in anticipation. And let me tell you, it was worth it. After finishing the book in 15 hours, I was on the edge of my bed wishing the 6th book came out tomorrow. As many of you have heard, someone dies in this book. Personally, he was my favorite character and somewhat of a father to Harry. That's all I'm saying. J.K. Rowling (the author) gives us definite variety in this book, as Harry is, for once, not the hero. Once again, as soon as Harry gets off the Hogwarts train for summer, you wish there was another one taking him back to Hogwarts. Many suprises and twists in this book. You might be very confused throughout the book, however it all comes together in the end."
2,uninspired,"ok, not exactly 2 but more like 2.5. but it was over-hype definetely. it gets hard to live up too i guess. the last 100 pages or so were alright but the entire first half of the book was almost a day-by-day account of harry's wonderously boring life. cheesy, though amusing, plots were thrown (ie. umbridge, the twins, cho) and dumbledore's big secret was not as shocking as it could have been considering the previous 4 books. the movies have seriously put a dent in the books as well. it wasn't the best but it's obvious that jk rowling's under some pressure to get the books out on time for rabid fans."
4,Not the best in the series,"Being the biggest harry potter fan i would say the fourth book was better than this. The third and fourth books had plot twists at the end and this book didnt. Most of the fans and i knew what was going to happen next as we read the book. thisn book is still very good even if its not as good as the fourth.it was worth it to spend about 5 hours waiting for midnight to come and then reading the book in 1 1/2 days.I thoght this book had a lot of humor in it. alot of funny sarcasim and jokes. some funny lines are LIKE THIS:""Cool name,"" said Harry, grinning and falling into a step beside his cousin. ""But you'll always be Ickle Diddykins to me."" OR THIS""Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?"" inquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of his Zonko's bags ""Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,"" said FredThis wasnt the best book in the series but its still worth reading"
3,Not What I Expected,"Countless of people, including myself, waiting impatiently for the new installment of Harry Potter. I was somewhat dissapointed. There was content which i found to be to ""adultish"" and there were times when the book lagged, and seemed not to go anywhere. It took a whole entire book, to get up to the part of Dumbledore telling Harry what he told harry (do not want to spoil it). It was like, i waited i read five books, and this is all she had to offer, most of which a person could guess, and got in the four books with his hints. But it was like the big hype, and a big let down. i expected alot more.But still it wasn't such a bad effort. I hope the next book is far far better. I mean writing this book for two years, she could have come up with somethign better. It should be more seamless next time."
3,"Liked if, but I'm having doubts about the series","The universal opinion I'd heard before reading this was that it was good, but had a more serious feel and was too long. Now that I've read it, I agree. I'm glad I read it and I'll certainly finish the series simply to find out how it ends (I'm not 100% sure about a happy ending after this read) but I won't reread as with the others. I could go into pages of specifics, but the truth is I simply didn't feel good during long parts of the book or after I finished it. 200 pages shorter, and I might've felt differently."
4,I liked this book despite myself.,"When I picked up the latest Harry Potter book, I was determined not to like it. Surely J.K. Rowling was running out of steam by now, surely she was just grasping for plot lines and new characters wherever she could get them. After the first few chapters, though, I was hooked, much to my chagrin. Rather than running out of steam, Rowling is hitting her stride. Although the book is perhaps a bit too long, Rowling wisely uses the pages to develop characters that we already know, rounding them out into people, not just stereotypes. Some have, and will continue to complain that this new installment does not advance the plot of the series enough, but I think it's about time we stopped moving at breakneck speed through Harry's life and took some time to look around and get acquainted with his world and the people in it."
4,"Not my favorite, but still pretty good...","Even though we are continuing the story of Harry Potter, there are a few things that bug me about this book. He seems more bitter, and more willing to take on the Dursleys all of a sudden, and the little interior monologues concerning fairness and jealousy are new. Also Dumbledore's attitude in the end to what he should have told Harry 5 years before strikes me as odd. Dumbledore was built as a character to be almost infalliable, and this is a pretty big mistake. I don't think I need to say anything on what happens to Sirius throuigh out this book. I didn't like that either.On the other hand, alot of questions were answered, I liked the part about the O.W.L.S., and the mystery behind the horseless carriages were pretty cool. And I especially liked the D.A.Overall, I give this 4 stars. You can't go wrong with harry potter.Books in order of my preference are:#1, #3, #4, #5, #2"
5,THE BEST,"this is the best book in the series yet. Harry is faced with as many moral problems as physical nabey and even more in this book. With the uprise of Lord voldomort there is much to think about. in this bok harry will learn more about his parents, dumbledore, proffesor snape, and even his own destiny.this bok will not let you down."
3,More of the same,"The fifth installment of the chronicle of Harry Potter is satisfying to Harry Potter fans but lacks some of the tension, excitement and creativity of the earlier books. As an adult reader I have primarily enjoyed the facinating information about the alternative lifestyle of the wizarding world. Not much new here except insight into the process of wizard housekeeping. Umbridge as the new evil at Hogwarts lacks the menace found in the earlier books and the the prophecy revealed atthe end is no surprise as most readers will have figured that out early in book one. It's worth reading if you liked the earlier books but hopefully serves mainly to set up the denouement for the final books with Harry and his friends playing more adult roles."
5,Another fun one,"This is probably not the best book I've read (ok, it definitely isn't), but it is one of the 5 most fun (along with 1, 2, 3, & 4). I still think Goblet of Fire is the best in the series, but the Order is right up there. Much darker (and longer) than even Book 4, the Order never becomes labourous--I read it in one 7 hour sitting on Saturday. While probably too dark for the average 8 year old, it has only left me wanting more."
3,A good (but darker) contiuation of the series.,"A good continuation of the series. The book is much better than the movie, filling in holes that the movie left. The book was also darker than the movie. In fact, it is the darkest so far. The movie ended on a 'hopeful' note, where the book left Harry still feeling down and alone. The fight seen in the ministry was also more realistic. Although good, the kids' skill were no were near as good as the death eaters. Also, in the book, people got hurt in that seen (something the movie left out). I will say that the author is getting more verbose in her books, but a the same time, she if filling in more of the story. Her books might have started off for kids, but at this point in the series, she is now writing for a more mature audience with political climate and power mad people (other than Voldimort). I still wish these books would be released on Ebook format (my one standing issue with the series).."
5,Great quality.,The book arrived as described by the delivery date. I recommend using this outlet. =)
3,A very dragged out read. ---scotrstone.com,"I was excited to read this novel when I stood in line at midnight to purchase it. Unfortunately, this version was not as well edited as it should've been. As is stated in the publishing world: the first edit is for the author, the second is for the audience. Because I only gave this novel three stars does not mean I hate the book or didn't properly read it. And if you give one of your favorite authors a less than stellar review doesn't mean you're not a ""true"" fan. I believe the story was there, but the book just needed to be trimmed way back to make the plot tighter. I thought the creativity was there. I loved the extendable ears and the Ministry scenes. Rowling has no shortage on making memorable events. Rowling certainly understands teenagers, but Harry's blow-up at Dumbledore is over the top. He should put more faith in the one person who's been there for him since the beginning. Overall, it was good, but not Rowling's best."
4,Good reading....,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a very nice book. J.K. Rowling gives a great description of all the happenings in Hogwarts and beyond. It is a bit scary and sad however. In fact this book solves many mysteries from the previous books (like the secret of why Voldemort wanted to kill Harry in the first place). The ""Defense Against the Dart Arts"" teacher Professor Umbridge has a very mean attitude and makes Harry feel particularly horrible. This book is very good but I would say that ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is better however."
5,Great,"Originally my favorite book was the Prisoner of Azkaban but after reading this the changed! While most people may not like it being dark, and violent I love it. If you think it is to violent for kids who sould of seen it coming with a charater like Voldemort. Being a teenager myself I think J.K. made Harry act just just like a normal teenager, it's great!"
2,Mediocre at best,"First I would like to note that i thoroughly enjoyed the first four Harry Potter novels.The new Harry Potter installment was far too long and drawn out . I felt like the book could have been written in 500 pages easily and have been more enjoyable. Entire chapters that are very trivial and usually disconnected from the story are scattered often throughout the book. The only thing in the first 700 pages of the book connecting to the anti-climactic conclusion was a recurring dream of Harry's. I never felt surprised in the novel and the character death had little effect on me. Also Harry's attitude throughout nearly the entire book is that of a whining, slef-pitying brat, which gets very annoying and impossible to enjoy the book."
4,Really emotional read...,"This is a great addition to the Harry Potter Collection. It will make you angry, worried, relieved, and even sad....and aching for the next installment!"
2,a dissapointment to the core,"I was dissapointed by this book tremendously. Half the time while I was reading it I didn't want to read on just because it was so depressing. It made me sad that nearly nothing uplifting happened to Harry. I also did not enjoy it to much because it was all so obvious. There was nothing really secretive about it. There was no real mystery that kept me wondering most of the time I was just bored. For an ordinary book it would have been ok, but for one in the Harry Potter series I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. I was also mad because she had written so much about the same thing over and over it just dragged. Maybe he next one wil be better but I definitly won't get my hopes up as much as I did for this one."
4,Transition book...but still the fabulous Harry Potter,"The man reading this book is a genius with voices! Because the book is so long, it does get tedious listening to it, but I still enjoy listening to it while I drive. Although I've read all the books, I still feel like book five is the book that is packed full of information (backwards and forwards) leading you into the last two. Sometimes I found myself bored by all the drawn out descriptions, but I was patient with them because #1...I love Harry Potter, and #2...I have a sneaking suspicion that these details are important for all that is to come. Altogether, a good tie-together of a book. You really have to stay on top of the discs, but still a great listen!"
2,Slow and predictable,"This book was quite simply the weakest of the series. While I love all of Rowlings' earlier Harry Potter books, I found this one repetative and downright boring in parts. As someone who often reads huge novels I was disappointed as I found myself skimming through yet another teen angst-filled chapter and desperately hoping that some sort of villain would appear, other then the obvious ones. I suspect Rowling was attempting to create a feeling of terror by keeping the enemies hidden, but all it ended up doing was making it seem as though there was no real villain. Also, for the 600 odd pages leading up to it, I found the climax pretty anti-climatic...Here's hoping Rowling can get this series back on track with the next book."
5,Worth the wait!!,Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix has more depth then the other books(with the exeptetoin of Goblet Of Fire). Harry lets out all that rage and his hormones break free. It's kind of scary at some points and at other times nice and warm.JKR is the best author EVER.
2,Too long with too little,"The Order of the Phoenix was way too long in my opinion. Most of the time there is nothing happening except school work and all the important stuff is in the second last chapter, period. I had to read way too much in order to come to the interesting parts and I was not as interested anymore. The book should have been half its current size and it might have been good. I would have enjoyed more about V-Voldemort and less about pranks in school.Anyways, hope that the next one is more on the lines of the ""Chamber of Secrets"" and the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" which were definitely the best books amongst Harry Potter series."
3,Disappointing,"While enjoying the four previous books immensley; I was rather disappointed in this long awaited sequel. It might be the longest book thus far, but feel it was unduly inflated (perhaps to assuage the readers long wait). To many undeveloped area's and repetition of thoughts as though just adding filler. Perhaps the editing process is what let the author and reader down. Or to much time in between writing efforts to maintain a continuative thought process.Nevertheless, will wait to read book six and hope for the best. Four out of five is a great average!"
5,Excellent! It achieves its purpose!,"Some might say that this book was long and drawn out. I often felt so, but it was entirely necessary. JK Rowling did a wonderful job of expressing Harry's growth and social life while moving the plot along. The book should not be any shorter than it is. This book is the turning point in the series. The other books seem to address trivial matters while this one focuses on things that are more important in life (human or wizard). The only problem I had was that when I reached the end, I was not satisfied. The book had a dramatic conclusion (a good thing) but I can't wait to find out what happens next!"
2,Was there an editor?,"I have been a big fan of Harry Potter since the first book, but this one is a monument to someone way too taken with herself. A good editor should have been able to sit her down and say ""look, it's too long. Yes, it's your baby, but its... too ... long..."" Way too many sideplots, too many new characters and no time to develop them.Then there is Harry. He goes from a pretty nice kid in June to a tortured, angry, megolomaniac in what--4 weeks? Nope, don't buy it. I wanted to shake some sense into him for the way he treated his friends.The tone of the whole book is dark and angry with the very occasional patches of humour (God rest ye merry hippogriffs!) and did not show the authors respect for the characters.Maybe 6 and 7 will be better."
4,Very Entertaining,All in all this is a very entertaining story. It is obviously a must have for Harry Potter fans.
5,The Best Harry Potter Book to Date!,"In the fifth instalment of Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts, we the reader can find that our heros temper has gone through the roof (In my personal opinion, I like him that way), Hogwarts has turned into some kind of war zone(Hogwarts against the new Defense against the dark arts teacher), a death that brought me to tears ,and the long awaited reason to why Voldemort wants Harry Potter dead.This novel developes and brings us the reader, up close and personal with the characters personalities, brings closer ties in the houses, and Harry finds himself the leader of a small group of rebelius teens. All in all this is the best book I have ever read and the wait for the sixth book will be harder to bare than for the fifth."
4,Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix,I thought it was great! It was definatly worth the wait line to get it. I would recomend this book to most people. But you might want to reread it again if your under 10 and then you will find out more from the book. This wasnt my favorite in the series but it had more action in it and a better plot to me than the others. Over all I enjoyed the book except for a few parts.
3,Worst of Potter Series,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the worst out of the series so far. I did enjoy the first few very much but this one was not as good. I still finished the book very very quickly but Harry in this book bothers me very much. This whole adolescence/teenage attitude does not work. He is much too abrupt and odd in this book that many people find him not likeable. Harry is growing up but the characterization of him in this book is just weird and annoying. However, it is still a very popular book and you just ""have to"" read it if you are a fan of the books. Hopefully the next will be better."
3,Very Drawn Out..,"I LOVED all of the recent Harry Potter books, but book #5 Order of the Phoenix was very drawn out. Every thing was detailed and then the deatails were detailed. The storyline was good though, as usual. JK Rowling is a very good writer, I just think she should've cut down some parts in book #5."
4,Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix,"Harry Potter and the Order of PhoenixByDakota LawrenceThe main setting in the story takes place in Hogwarts. Harry goes on wild adventures.He fights off he-who-should-not-be-named. Then his godfather dies. Then he got told his life story.The main characters are Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Wesley. Also inThe book is Sirius Black. He gets killed. It's sad really.My opinion is that this is a good book. You would really like it."
2,ahhhh!,"this book is boreing! if you like fantasy, check out the dragonlance books. the first dl book is around 400 pages and this thing is like 6 or 8 hundred but look at the typing! its freakin huge!"
5,JK does it again...,"A few years have passed since the release of the fourth Harry Potter book (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), allowing the expectations of the following installment in the series to become higher and the fans to grow ever more anxious BUT - it's finally here! And fortunately, readers young and old will not be disappointed. During Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, many events cause the wizarding world and the 'regular' world to intertwine, some relationships grow stronger as some grow apart, many old friends return along side the appearance of new ones and Harry's world is turned upside down. This book develops the characters in a way we have not seen before but also leaves room for action and suspense. JK Rowling has once again created an amazing book and I would recommend it to all, no matter their age."
2,What the..?,"Are you Sirius?? A book this long and it hasn't anymore powerful blow than the previous four? Too much unnecessary detail and too many leads which lead no where. And the ending... by Merlin's beard! it hasn't any substance at all. By far it is the dullest, mind-numbing Potter series ever written. Put more quality in the next ones will ya Ms. Rowling, not quantity, let alone it's pretty boring. Sorry to say, but it is as it is. By the way... the third movie sucks, I'd say you'd better let Chris Columbus do the rest of your films, honestly, and I bet you know why already. PS: don't rush things just because you need to meet some deadlines."
3,"Parents, Use Caution!","No spoilers here, but parents read on please!I am about half way through the book - reading it before my child comes home from camp. There is no way that I will be comfortable reading this book to her or with her. In almost 400 pages Harry has gone from angry and frustrated to angrier and more frustrated. The previous joy he got from flying, the satisfaction from positive adult role model relationships, even the amazement in feast and friends have been replaced with angst, worry and questions. We all knew that there would be darkness - but this is beyond expectation and makes me sad and more, makes me struggle with opening the world of Harry to my child any further. Teens - they have more ability to perceive life through these lenses. I will look forward to seeing what other parents have to say."
5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,I think this book is excellent because it has plenty of adventure.
3,GOOD,"I agree it is darker, yet its supposed to be. We are talking about battleing the dark arts here people. However, I would recommend skimming through the past books, because it has been awhile since I myself read them, so I had forgotten some of the details. To be honest, I was hoping for a more dramatic ending. I was somewhat disappointed. To be honest it took me forever to get through the first part of this book. However, midway through the book hooked me. All in all though I am glad I bought it and read it. It was worth the wait in line at midnight. However, I enjoyed the previous books better."
3,unbelievable yet enjoyable,"As usual, JK Rowling's humor adds spice to the novel, but the plot itself is somewhat farfetched and bland. Umbridge's behavior is not explained (motive-wise, unless the ministry of magic has a habit of employing annoying, inane fanatics) fully. There seems to be too many little facts appearing here and there(such as all the new characters I certainly do not have the intention of even trying to remember, James' detestable behavior, etc, etc.), whereas the main, central stem (i.e Harry's struggle with Voldemort to get 'the weapon') is not expounded upon until perhaps the last 70 pages. That might explain the fact that the book appears to be loaded and yet vapid. However, it is not an unenjoyable one, as at any rate Rowling's world and its hero Harry retain their attractiveness."
3,Harry Potter Order of Phoenix,"This book took so long to be published must be because it took so long to write, it certianly wasn't due to the editing, since it was over 850 pages long.J.K. Rowlings in very fine fashion , conveys to the reader Harry's frustration, and the readers frustrations will be sorely tested like Harry's, since it takes over 750 pages to get some sort of answers or action on the part of the characters.J.K. Rowlings slowly built up to the end but didn't really put out the readers concerns over Harry's mental conditions, nor his relationships with Dumbeldore or his friends. Maybe he is growing up and this is just part of life. I see the younger readers will not like the Harry Potter in this book.Hopefully we the readers will not have to wait another 2+ years for the next one."
4,Magical as always...,"Harry Potter is a good read. Unfortunately, it wasn't 'great' -- not compared to the other books -- because of a very sullen, self-pitying angry main character. However, he is surrounded by an amazing cast of supporting characters; Ron and Hermione steal the show. (""Clip-clop!"") The humour is still there, but overall it is a darker book and I probably wouldn't give it to younger kids (although they'd probably take it anyway)."
2,Disappointed,"There isn't much to say about this book other than it doesn't compare to the rest of the series. This story is so bloated by unnecessary scenes that it's frustrating to read.Also, up to this point, all the previous Harry Potter books had an element of mystery to them that this book, unfortunately, did not. The ending seemed forced to be more like the previous book (which was excellent).If it weren't for the fact that J. K. Rowling could write about paint drying and make it seem interesting, this book would be terrible. Fortunately for her, she has that ability and, with as many negatives that this book has, her writing still makes it bearable."
2,The Worst Harry Potter,"I really like Harry Potter, but in my point of view in this book, it was disgusting. There was no story, and it was very, very boring. If you want to read the Harry Potter books, read the 4th, 3rd, and the 6th."
1,Let's Hope this is Just Bump in the Road,"Book 5 in the series was a disjointed, plodding waste of time. The characters were very uninspired (Tonks in particular, boy was she annoying!!) and the whole Order of the Phoenix business seems totally unncessary. I hope that Rowling can pull it all together in book 6."
5,awesome book,I loved this book. It just grabs you. I couldn't put it down. Only one problem it took me two months to read it. But besides that its awesome
4,Harry Potter,"I chose this rating because, the book was very enterprising and interesting but I thought it could've been better. I would recommend this to my much Tolkien- Addicted brother. He read a few chapters and it was love at first sight. I haven't read the books but I will soon."
1,Not what I hoped for.,I'm ten years old. My mother and my grandma have read them to me. I wanted to have this one so much but now we have it I think it's boring. Nothing is funny in this one. Nothing happens for a long time. There is too much talking. Harry just sits and sits and doesn't get to be with Ron or Hermione very much. They keep talking about stuff that happened in the other books that I can't really remember very much and my grandma can't too. I wish it was shorter. I keep going to sleep when she reads it to me and I hate to go to sleep....(typed by his grandmother)
3,Where was the editor?,"Oh dear. The very talented Ms Rowling has finally fallen victim to her own stupendous success, and she's relying on her reputation to do the work for her.This bloated tome needs to be cut in half. It needs all the adjectives and adverbs and flabby writing removed. One character snarls three times on one page!Most of all, it needs Harry to lighten up. OK, he's going through adolescent angst... but does he really need as many tantrums and shouting matches? The brave boy has turned into a boring whiner.What are Bloomsbury thinking of? This reads like a book rushed into print, rather than one that's been edited. It doesn't bode well for number six and seven...What a shame."
3,Dark and disappointing,"I had thouroughly enjoyed all the books in the Harry Potter series up until my recent reading of the Order of the Phoenix. JK Rowling recent addition to these wonderful books has left my angry and frustrated. How could she have killed off Sirius? His death was unneeded and completely shocking. As I began the last chapter, I found myself hoping in vain that he would somehow still be alive. But I was wrong. This book is very depressing and left me feeling incomplete. I am very disappointed in JK Rowling."
4,Rowling's new book is solidly good!,"I got my copy Saturday at 2AM and finished abiut 11:30AM. It was well worth that marathon 91/2 hour reading session.Overall, this book deals with a Harry going through the time in his life that most of remember as trying: adolesence. He has to deal with the disolusionment that comes from shedding our black and white chilhood view of the world, instead seeing in the grays of adulthood. It is difficult for Harry to deal with the feelings that deeper knowledge of his heroes and enimies is bringing him. Things are not as clear-cut as they used to be in his mind. Harry is angier in this book, and he is starting to question things he accepted easily before.There are also great challenges, plot twists, very solid writing in the Order Of The Phoenix. We get some answers, and closure, yet we leave with new questions. JK has yet again spun for us a complelling novel. I hope she has started writing the next one!Forgive my misspellings, very tired now."
5,Best Yet,"This is by far the best in the series. The author like the main charecter continues to grow wiser and more sophisticated as the series progresses. This one has Harry turned 15 learning more about himself and how the world works as he also copes with the problems typical to teenagers.This story allso has a very ponient lesson for all of us, particularly with the fear coming from 911. That my must not surender our freedom to become safe. ... This story should be read by all."
5,Amazing,"Book 5 met all of my expectations and then exeeded them. J.K Rowling dug deeper into every charachter and made me love them even more. Order of the Pheonix was also the most revealing book so far, but still left plenty to be uncovered in the next two books, which hopefully will be just as long, or possibly even longer. Fans will not be dissapointed."
2,Disappointed...,"My boys and I have spent many wonderful hours reading Harry Potter stories together. However, I am not reading them this one---not for a long time.This book has far too much pain and suffering to be a children's story. I realize Ms. Rowling created these characters and can treat them any way she chooses, but some characters have such a complete personality change that it makes this ""believable fiction"" feel so truly unreal."
3,Korny,"Most of the book was pretty good, i guess. But at the climax of the book where the reason for harrys scar was explain i thought the answer was a bit korny. She should have spent some more time thinking of a better explaintion. other than that the Book was alright. I though the climaz wasnt has good has it would have seemed to be."
2,Where's the mystery?,"All four of the previous Harry Potter series culminate in the solving of a mystery. They are like detective stories, keeping the reader on his toes, constantly guessing who the bad guys were. The newest installment, however, is utterly predictable. The book ends without any significant revelations. A true disappointment, especially considering the Goblet of Fire was such a tour de force."
1,Poor Harry! Written into a corner.,"This series is going downhill fast. Three quarters of this enormous, formulaic book is Harry feeling sorry for himself. Not without reason. Everyone's out to get him. That theme is completely worn out. Wouldn't you think that after all these years the adults would start trusting him more? He's always proven to be right in the end.The book drones on and on. I didn't need another long, long description of a quidditch match.Finally, in the last quarter of the book the plot starts moving and gets interesting. The book could have been trimmed 500 pages and been much more entertaining."
3,Moody times,"I don't know why a character in a series (especially a character as charming and resilient as Harry Potter) has to be given a book (or even a chapter) in which he acts like a brat for most of the time. I understand that we need to witness maturation, development, etc., but I'm sure those things could be accomplished without making the main character unpleasant. Sheesh..."
4,Loads of new info but my anticipation may have been too high,"Well, I just finished the 5th Harry Potter book and although I am sleep deprived it was still worth it! I'm not sure why I read it so fast because it just makes me yearn for books six and seven! True Potter fans will really appreciate all the work J.K. Rowling puts into this book and all the new information we receive. I am constantly amazed at how real J.K. makes Harry. I really got to remember how crappy 15 is and all the emotions you feel! I'm proud to be a Potter fan...even if I am an adult ;)"
3,One of Rowling's Worst,"What's the opposite of ""damning with faint praise?"" The Order of the Phoenix is, along with Chamber of Secrets, one of the two least interesting novels written by JK Rowling. That said, it's still good. The problem is that as Book 5 is Harry's teenage phase, Harry's kind of a jerk for part of the book. Also, while the previous book was a phenomenal payoff to the beginning of the series, Rowling has to spend alot of time planting seeds for the further books.It's a good book, it just has the misfortune to be in amongst much better books. You still have to read it though."
3,harry potter & the order of the phoenix,"This installment is easily the weakest in the series. The writing is all over the place, and there is no central plot to drive the story. That being said, the book is still good. I've just come to expect more from this series."
5,This is probably the best book yet,"I still have about 200 pages left in the book, but it's amazing. Rowling has probably done the best on this book filling it with every detail she could cramp into the almost 900 pages she records. In this book, Harry starts his fifth year at Hogwarts on the rocks. Voldemort has come back and many things are happening. For one, Ron and Hermione start their first year as prefects. More will happen as readers soar through the fifth addition!"
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Harry suffers from the attempts by others to protect him when he just wants to know what's going on. Life is dark and frustrating for Harry as he attempts to come to grips with the understanding that the adults in his life aren't as perfect as he thought. My overall impression of the tone set by this book is isolation and frustration. I didn't like it, there is enough of that in real life. It didn't seem as if there are ANY happy moments in this novel. Depressing."
4,J.K Rowling can do better,"Although I found Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix pretty good the ending came somewhat as a disappointment.I expected something more thrilling than a ......................what did come at the end.But the book served to raise some more questions and a lot of the old questions were answered.I am particularly curious about the new issues Rowling is raising about Petunia Dursley and even James Potter.And all the stuff we've been hearing about Harry's temper and bad moods is rubbish.. I think he is perfectly justified in shouting whenever he does..he is after all, a teenager, not a saint.Rowling has certainly put together a very enthralling book and is definetely a must-read for all."
2,Way to long..,I have waited a long time to get back to my adventures at Hogwarts and to say the least I am very confused. What was the point of this story? Why was everyone so upset? Why didn't JK play up some of the more interesting tidbits in the story. Petunias letter. Hagrids suprise. Etc. I hope this was not all just to set up the last two books.All and all it just left me feeling empty. I always enjoy Dumbledore giving out house points and the closing feast. Oh well. Maybe next time. Oh yeah. Will I have to wait two years for the next book?
2,DEPRESSING,"From the first book the the fourth book, the Harry Potter books were enchanting and spellbinding...one could only imagine the fabulous new adventures to come in the fifth and latest book. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, however, was a highly disappointing purchase. Between Harry's unusually negative attitude and the overall dark feel of the book, this fifth addition proved no where near its predecessors. Excitment is lacking and the only modivation the reader has to continue reading is the hope that the plot will improve, but only to finish in disappointment. To top the book off, a miserable and very unnecisary death of a main character takes place at the end, leaving the reader feeling empty and thouroughly depressed. Though I rate the other books five stars and this book did keep the reader interested, I must say that it was a very depressing experience."
4,growing pains,"Wonderful story. Just wish I didn't have to wait so long between books. Harry going through growing pains and the realization that he's not the center of the universe. Ending was disappointing though, almost a let down."
4,The best book in the series so far,"Many people have said that JKR made Harry too unlikable in this book. What they have to realize is that Harry isn't eleven years old anymore; he's fifteen and in the middle of a SERIOUS war about to happen. He isn't going to be happy and cheerful while going through puberty, causing the death of one of his classmates, AND being ridiculed in front of the entire wizarding world. Harry's growing up.One thing I think JKR could have done much better on would be developing the relationship between Sirius and Remus. These two have been friends since they were eleven, and she didn't show their connection well enough. Remus barely makes an appearance in the book at all, and both his and Sirius's personalities are underdeveloped.I think JKR did a wonderful job showing Harry's reaction to Sirius's death. He seems like a real person now, someone everyone can relate to. I'm just happy she's making him grow up!"
3,Expected better,"I've never been a huge fan, and didn't assaulted the book shops the day the book has been released, but I was looking forward to read it. And well, I must say that I'm a bit dissapointed.Despite the many hundreds pages, there is not much going on, and after I went through the book, there was some hollow feeling within me. The story is not very deep, and there is almost no suspense, no big enigma solved, but just a few drama as the author finally kills a character. This fifth book seems more like a huge foreword to the next books than a story on its own.Despite that, it's a pleasant reading. You can't help but being hooked by the wonderful setting and attractive characters. And, better late than never, there come some changes in the way of thinking of characters.I expected better, but a catchy reading nonetheless."
3,"Good Story, too long a wait","In my opinion, she could have edited this book and gotten rid of some of the chapters. I am glad I was not on the Harry band wagon, cause I did not wait three years to read the fifth book.The story is compelling and I do wish she had planned better how she was going to handle these sequels. She really should not make fans wait so long to enjoy the story of the boy wizard."
3,Lacking a lot of intrigue,"The previous Potter books especially 3 and 4 had many cliff hanging, suspenseful aspects. However, it seemed that Rowling elaborated on many things, but didn't really have the gusto she did in her previous books. Most exciting parts were left until the end, if they were even considered exciting. Too much detail, not enough action!"
4,Even better,I can't wait for the next one now! The plot is getting so much better and more mature! Only downside is the character's reactions are sometimes unrealistic.
3,It was OK,"I read this whole book last year and am now rereading it. The first time I read it, I thought it was terrible and dragged out endlessly. I also didn't like the fact that Harry would have stupid fits about nothing. The best part was the end, which was excelent. As I reread it, I am noticing that I am enjoying it much more than last time. I still think the auther had to little story for 800 pages, and wanted to make it long simply because she could. All in all, I thought this book was OK, although still the weakest of all the Harry Potter books so far."
3,Legendary Herry Potter - confused and stupefy,"The 5th continuation of legendary Herry was probably the most expected book ever, however, his quality and style differs from previous books very much.It begins extremely slowly with description of the overview of Herry's suffering at home, unlogically complicated with Dementors in the Mudworld, following with weird behavior of Dumbledore and all-the-time-keeped-secrets.Clause seems like usual Rowlings style with a new element of Prof. Umbridge as a bad girl, torturing and bullying everybody in school. I quite appreciate this negative element in the school, but sometimes it seems to exceed the limits (when torturing Harry until he is bleeding).If the final combat between Death Eaters and Dumbledore's Army was left out, the book might be quite readable and hasty....Anyway, I recommend everybody not to let themselves be disgusted with that unhappy 120 fighting pages, it is worthy to read it to the very end."
4,Thoughts for Harry,"Let me start off first by saying that I enjoyed the book, though it seems to me that Rowling has simply chosen to use this book as a filler and a means to an end. From what I can discern, only three major issues are brought out, and character development is largely squashed by Harry's temper. Ron and Hermione come no closer to realizing what they mean to each other, and though Harry teaches his talents to others, he doesn't display a large improvement himself.Though I was sad to see a main character die, their involvement in this book is minimal and Rowling shows no effort to make the reader more fond of the character during this book. I think overall the book draws on the reader's emotional attachment in past books rather than developing a further empathy.I still love the Potter series, and anxiously await more novels, but Rowling seems to have held back in the Order of Phoenix. I only hope she has a reason for this (maybe the next books will be that much better for it?)."
3,Too Long Winded,"For as long as we waited for this tome to come out, it was disappointing. I just couldn't care about these characters as much as I did in the previous books.If you are already a Harry Potter fan, this won't matter - but if this was the first one of the series you had ever read, you wouldn't be chomping at the bit for the next one.More than anything, it just felt as if it could really use a good editor."
4,Not her best,"J.K. Rowling's 5, and probably most anticipated Installment features some great undertones, but the magic is gone. While the novel is good, it just boasts rage and fury, with unruliness and unfairness falling in between. It does not really pull in the magic that Harry Potter had, but again, perhaps it's better that it lost the warm magic, because the seventh book could go either way, according to the prophecy."
4,An Excellent Addition to the Series,"I am a very Big Harry Potter fan at the age of 20, and the ""Order of the Phoenix"" was equally as exceptional as the ""Goblet of Fire,"" making the series one step closer to completion. The only things I did not like about this book were Harry's reaction and dealing with young teenager situations, particularly those with Cho Chang; also, the book doesn't really start to get a main storyline track leading up the denouement until past the halfway point, perhaps even almost to 3/4 through the book. You don't really know what is the point of a lot of the beginning action until near the very end. Otherwise, bravo! I Can't wait until the 6th comes out."
5,Another Great one!!,"If you are a Potter Fan, here is another great read. It does not have as much adventure as some other the other books, but is more of a coming of age story. You get a better in-depth look at Harry Potter and some of the other great charaters."
5,A great book,"This book was the best book in the Harry Potter series yet. It had a great plot and a lot of suprising twist and turns. A Dumbledore vs Voldemort battle is in this book even though it dosen't last very long. There is a main character who dies in this book, but he was only in the last two books. HINT! HINT!"
5,"A Fantastic, Magical Continuation of a Fabulous Tale","Harry Potter, now fifteen, shows a more grown-up, teenager view of life in this, the fifth book in the Harry Potter series. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry shows us a bit more attitute, some teenage angst, and a more rounded character. After all, who really believes in a character who has no faults?"
5,J.K. Does it again,"The fifth Harry Potter book is perhaps the richest installment of the Harry Potter series. In The Order of the Phoenix, Rowling does an excellent job of mixing humor, romance, suspense, and action into one long novel. Being a huge Harry Potter fan , i was very anxious to get the book and when I did, I practically stayed up all night entranced by the exciting plot and unexpected finish. I finished the book in less than 24 hours and spent the rest of the day preaching to my family about what an excellent book it was. I reccomend this book to any diehard Harry Potter fan or any person(kid or adult) who is looking for a great summer read."
4,"okay, but three years was not worth the wait","In this installment, Harry again faces issues of growing up and growing as a wizard. The item that negatively jars me the most in this book was the fact that where Harry previously was an upbeat character with a strong support network of friends who strove to overcome the adversity that life through at him in this book he is foul tempered, shrewish and self serving. While it could be argued that it is a natural progression for any teen to feel a variety of emotions and to question authority, I found myself becoming tired of his endless self pity and truculent attitude."
5,Another great story!,"This book, although full of darkness, is another great addition to the Harry Potter set. My stomach was in knots from beginning to end."
3,Not great,The fifth installment was a little disappointing. The Harry Potter character is different (in a bad way). And when will anyone give Snape a chance? Still worth reading though. Just don't expect too much.
3,I lost sympathy,"The Harry Potter I encountered in this book was unlike the young boy I met in the previous books. He is so angry and impatient. At one point in the story, I lost all sympathy with him and was hoping for his downfall. The ending was too obvious, unlike in the other books. Overall, it was enjoyable, but I hope she makes him less angry in the next book."
2,One Of The Worst Books I've Ever Read,"This was one of the dumbest books I've ever read and in my opinion, the worst edition in the series so far. First of all it was way too long and you could've taken about 200 pages out of the book and it would have had the same effect. The character development was off and even though she was showing them during their adolesence, they were very obnoxious. Also, it took a very, very long time to get intereresting and I found myself procrastinating and finding excuses to not read it. Overall, it was a horrible book and a waste of a week reading it."
3,eh...........,"I liked this book a lot when it wasn't rambling on....and on....It's very unnecessarily long. Rowling drawls on for a while without really getting anywhere plot wise, but it did pick up in spots and then I really did enjoy it. I still don't see any reason for killing of the character that she did. I had sort os suspected that was who it was going to be, but nevertheless, it didn't seem necessary. It didn't add to the plot at all, and it seemed like it was just a device for getting to reveal some things at the end. Unless there's some reason to be revealed later, it seems like it was put in just to be dramatic. Oh well. I still recommend the book though, despite the slow pace."
5,In my top 3 of the HP series,"WOW! Thsi book has been long awaited, but it's worth it. You see old characters such as Sirius black and Remus Lupin, and the REAL mad eye moody! In the beginning Harry is a little whiny, but he ahs a good reason to be. A few people have said that JK Rowling explained things to thouroly, and that no action happened til the last 100 -200 pages, but i have 2 disagree. There's action, even if it's ajust a little, throughout the whole book and how could you write a GOOD book without details? Overall, this book is in my top 3 of fgave HP books. I loved this book and am reading it again! I recogmend this book(the whole series 4 that matter) to anyone who hasn't read it yet, 4 some odd, weird reason)."
2,Over hyped,"JK Rowlings is a very good writer and I must say that I've enjoyed the first 4 books of the Harry POtter series. After reading book 4, I couldn't wait to read book 5. However, I finished reading it yesterday and I didn't enjoy it that much. The series has become formulaic and rather predictable. The adults act too stupid for words ,even Dumbledore whose explanations for his actions are so weak and full of holes...Too many flaws in the book and I was often bored reading the book.I even remember the first 4 books better than this one.At least the death scene wasn't grisly but at this point in the book I found most of the characters irritating and I wasn't sorry to see the person die. The annoying thing though is all the hype made in the media about JK Rowkings crying after she killed off this character.The book wasn't that bad, I'm just irritated about all the efforts made(JK Rowlings claims its to protect the children. YEAH RIGHT) to keep this sub standard plot secret.DISSAPOINTING!!!"
4,Rowling strives to achieve book-writing dominance once agai,"In the 5th Hrry Potter book, JK Rowling tries her best to extend the plot much past her previous books. After waiting quite a few years, this book is not as satisfying as hoped, as many of the readers have thus lost interest. The beginning of the book drags on, leaving the reader bored until he/she reaches the main plot. My child still wishes to read about Harry in somewhat happy times, instead of gloominess and hotility throughout the book. The latest book in this series is much of a disappointment, and hopefully Rowling will be able to captivate her readers better in the future."
4,Great read!,"This book was a great read! I couldn't put it down and finished it in 4 days. I like the way that the author, J.K. Rowling, ties all the characters together and you actually feel like you know the characters personally. I can't wait to read the 6th book."
4,no title,"This book was not the best in the series, my favorite being the third one, but it was very good. The plot was very interesting and started up right where the last book left off. My favorite character dies which I didn't like. Otherwise, good."
4,Great storytelling and a good story,"It's probably pointless to write this review. After all, who's going to read this who hasn't already the book and formed their own opinions?But I'll try anyway. J.K. Rowling simply dazzles me. With every book she writes, she builds a new, complex mystery involving shifting allegiances, genuinely evil bad guys, and incredibly sympathetic good guys. She's funny, she's dramatic, she's inventive, and she's just an all-around good storyteller.Having said that, I'm not sure The Order of the Phoenix is the best book she has written so far. I'd give that honor to The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had a series of killer plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. At times, The Order of the Phoenix struck me as more... pedestrian, perhaps, or maybe just less surprising.Still, even a mundane story set at Hogwarts is a cause for celebration. I laughed, I very nearly cried at the ending, and I've re-read it four times. Here's hoping book six is even better!"
4,Great Product--Extended Waiting Time,"Great condition, not much to say about the product itself, just that it took three 1/2 weeks to arrive :("
3,"Intriguing story within a series, but a bit lacking","This book was similar to the others in the series in time frame and scope, and the writing style and over all climax structure were well done as usual, but there was something lacking in the heart of this book. It went through each disappointment in Harry's year, but did not lead to any rescues or satisfying answers to those disappointments. It just led to more disappointments. It was apparently meant to be that part of Harry's life where he learns the hard lessons of unanswered questions, but that took away from its value as an entertaining story. I did like the development of the characters, but there were also several loose ends left at the end.A decent Harry Potter standard, but not my favorite bit of fiction."
3,was thoroughly confused,"biggest complaint - the picture you see of this book, the picture you look at when deciding to purchase this item is the BLUE American release of HP5. The book that arrived was the BRITISH version, which I won't go into the details on how the versions are different. Do the research.I don't remember seeing anywhere in the description of what I purchased, THIS IS THE BRITISH RELEASE. I now have a complete set on HP books, with one random odd- ball."
2,Most Disapointed,"I waited two years on pins and needles for this book, as I got everyone one at worked hooked on Harry Potter I am such a fan that is all I listen to at work, over and over again for two years.Finally she comes out with the new book I was elated and within the reading of the first chapter my heart sank, somewhere along the line she turned Harry into a whining spoiled little brat who cared about nothing but me, me, me.I hoped it was just me and as I got into the book it would get better but it didn't then to kill [a character] off at the end made me want to get on a plane and go to England and shake this women and ask her ""Why did you do this, he is no longer the boy you wanted to protect and show that love was possible.""I can assure you I will not wait with baited breath for the last installment."
3,"Ok , but hard to get into","Adults may enjoy this book, but my friends and I have found it hard to get into, like a lot of information is dumped on us at the beginning. It's a little boring, in fact, and we have agreed that each of us had to struggle through the intro until finally Harry gets back to school. I hear the author cried at the death of a main character I won't mention, but I can't say that I did. It's fun to be back in Harry's world, but I think the book would have been a lot better if it had been a LOT shorter and written more with kids in mind.Carole, age 13"
4,After such a long wait...,"I was just a little disappointed! Mind you, I did really like the book, and I could NOT put it down! (I would give it 4-1/2 stars if that were available.)But I don't think Phoenix is quite as good as Goblet was. Nor nearly as ""dark"" as was hinted. Actually, except for the scene in the Ministry of Magic (disappointing), it was more cheeky and light in the fashion of the earlier books!I will say that the Weasley's were superb, Hermione was surprising, and Professor Umbridge was the quintessential villain! Harry was - Harry. And the end was a tad anticlimactic.Having said all that, I am still eagerly awaiting the next one, and hope we don't have to wait 3 years! And if it is as long as this one, I would hope they would put it in two volumes, as the book was positively unwieldy to read...especially in bed!"
5,A Great Sequel,"This is by far my favorite book of the Harry Potter series so far. It was exciting and shocking, even upsetting, but isn't that what a good novel should be? I was shocked when *blank* died (for those of you who don't want to know). The character development was fantastic and it was interesting to see how Rowling created enemies out of the Ministry of Magic esp. the witch Umbridge. It will shock and surprise as promised."
3,The Empire Strikes Back of Harry Potter Books,"First, let me say that I promise not to ruin anything. I just finished reading it and I walk away with the feeling that this book, while very neccesary Plot-wise, will make a horrible movie for all its loose ends. Don't get too attached to very many subplots, unless you don't mind waiting another three years to see how everything finally turned out."
5,one of the best books ever,"THIS BOOK MAYBE LONG ,BUT MOST OF IT IS GREAT. WHEN I FIRST READ IT I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN UNTIL IT WAS COMPLETED. OF COURSE THERE THERE ARE THE DOWN SIDES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HIM IN A BAD MOOD BUT IT STILL MEETS, MAYBE EVEN SURPASSES THE STANDARD SET BY THE PREVIOUS 4 BOOKS. IT IS A MUST READ BOOK HOPE THE NEXT BOOK WONT HAVE A LONG WAIT."
4,worth the wait!,"It starts off a bit slow, but this book is a winner! An honest-to-goodness page turner, I could not put it down. While it lacks the cover-to-cover emotional intensity of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"", it does have a great number of shining moments.There are any number of surprise appearances of almost-forgotten characters from other books. A few scenes had me laughing out loud, and a few more had me weeping. One of my most beloved characters, Neville, plays a bigger part than ever before...something that had me grinning from ear to ear.And a final note - this is a dark, dark book....WAY darker than ""Goblet of Fire"". To be honest, I don't know if I would read it to anyone under the age of 8 or so. It was great...but dark.Can't wait to see where this series goes next!"
2,Wasn't that great,"The book wasn't that great. Much ado about nothing. Irritating characters, predictable storyline. Ah well, it is a kid's book.At least there weren't any gruesome rituals like in book 4. I preferred the previous 4 books . There was just too much fuss made over the plot so I expected something spectacular."
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Undeveloped plotline.,"Ok, so it's the 5th book, and the first chapter is MARVELOUS! I must say, it ended with a bang and was full of suspense and action...and then the story kicked into low gear. It's long. And it is very much an ending to the 4th book, but I'm afraid that it carried the weight of a book that was thrown together with bits off the cutting room floor. I get the feeling from it that the author was pre-occupied in writing this story. I'm a huge fan, I own all four previous years in Hardback and on CD and I love them. My favorite story remains ""Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban"". Unfortunately I can't give details of what made the story drag for me, not without spoiling it for you. I would say, Buy this book if you love Harry. It'll be needed to get into the 6th book, but don't start reading the series here."
3,Good thing its already a bestseller.....,"Not her best work. I guess since she knew everyone would buy it anyway, she should just include everyting she liked- even long drawnout plotlines which did nothing to move the story along. Reaching adolecent angst (which I suppose should be expected at 15) brings out nothing likable about any of the characters. The only slightly interesting thread was the answer to the ""who dies"" question which was not only predictable- but unexciting or even emotional. I am sure I will keep reading the series as I will have another 3 years to get interested again."
5,The best yet,Definitely the best one yet hopefully the next two will be really good. Thing will definitely get interestingi just hope he doesn't wait another 3 years to publish it
4,An wonderful edition to the series!,"""It's always darkest before the dawn."" That statement sums this book up beautifully. Dark, menacing and filled with young adult angst, this fifth installment in the Harry Potter series is a heavy load to carry. All the characters are coming of age and are torn by their own loss of innocence with the confrontation of evil and the disillusionment of their governering authorities. As old mysteries are cleared up, new mysteries are brought to light and the reader can feel every ounce of confusion that the characters feel themselves. Although this book doesn't stand up above the other four books and may disappoint those who had hoped for more answers, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix paves the way for the final two books splendidly!"
5,"I STARTED FROM MIDNIGHT AND ENDED AT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON""",All i have to say is that this book is going to blow people away. I don't really want to give very much away except that Harry Potter goes through alot of pain during this book. In this book Harry has to face his worst fears and most start standing up to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I must go now and read the book again.
4,Harry's a whiner.,"Unfortunately Harry is reminding me more and more of Luke from Star Wars. ""But I wanted to go into Toschi Station!"" He is becoming a character I don't respect much. I also felt we got too little of Dumbledore in this installment. The book was still good though. Good enough to read in two sittings. ****/*****"
5,H/P lovers review,This is one of the best books i havew read for years. I finished it very soon and i still can't forget it. It is powerful and full of magic and suspense just like the other 4 of the series. As the books are getting thicker and thicker also the stories within the book becomes more breath catching. The only thing delusional to me is that it ended up even more drammaticaly than the previous one. I wa kind of hoping for a happier ending this time. After you finish the book you have this feeling of sadness and really would like the book to change. Now i can only hope the 6th book will be out soon (say another 3 years?)
5,One of the best books I ever read.,"I loved this book, at the begining it was boring and I would read only A few pages, (according to my mom the boring stuff will make the rest of the book interesting.) Once he gets to Hogwarts though this book is hard to put down."
3,Other four kicked its butt,"to tell you the truth I was pretty disapointed with this one. It hardly even seemed like it was the same person writing. Dont get me wrong, it was alright. But after reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which is by far the best book I have ever read, I was expecting more. It was far to long for what it was and the teachers werent in it nearly enough, like McGongall. She is like my favorite charactor. Plus now Harry is a selfish brat and I dont like that at all! I wasnt really into the whole Order of the Phoenix, there should have been a better plot then that. Like I said, it was ok, but not the bast."
2,The long awaited disappointment,"I was very hesitant to purchase any of the Harry Potter books. After the first one, I was hooked! I LOVED every book up until this one. 1st, its too long. This book could have been condensed to about 300 pages without losing any of the story line. It was very slow getting into, and the ending was horrible! I believe we all like the Harry Potter books for the adventures at Hogwarts, this book didn't have much of that. I really hope the movie of this book isn't as disappointing as the book itself."
5,marvelous!,"I bought the book a while ago, but hadn't gotten around to reading it because it is nigh onto 900 pages and wanted the time I thought it would take to read it. Boy, was I wrong! I read this book in two days. It could've been longer and it still wouldn't have seemed too long, that was how easy and enjoyable it was to read. I have all of the Harry Potter books and have enjoyed them all and yet I think this was one of my favorites. I am an adult that thoroughly enjoyed this book just as much as the younger generation. Another success for this author and I am looking forward to the next book."
2,Depressing,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I found it very depressing. Cruel in its treatment...the incident of Harry's hand being sliced open and bleeding was nasty. I wondered if Ms Rowlings had had bad experiences with teachers as she made some so vicious. I did not think the story of Harry's father tormenting SNAPE added anything to the story line. The story carried the line that Harry HAD TO learn to control his own mind yet turned him over to the worst teacher for this. Did not make sense at all. And the Centaurs, once Harry's heroes, have turned into villains.I bought copies of these HP books in the past, for family and friends. I will not buy anymore of this copy. I would not recommend it for children at all. I would not recommend it for anyone who loved the HP books in the past. Ms R. took a wrong turn somewhere."
1,KILL YOUR DARLINGS,"There's nothing wrong with an 870 page book. There is, however, something wrong with an 870 page book in which half of it DOESN'T MOVE THE STORY ALONG. In a good book, every single word should keep the story moving. J.K. Rowling needs to learn how to KILL HER DARLINGS. This means if she has a chapter, subplot, paragraph, etc. that does not move the story along, no matter how much the author likes it, she must ELIMINATE IT. If this book was reduced to 350 pages, it would be a compelling and incredible novel. Instead, we are bored out of our minds end with things like Harry's pathetic romance with Cho."
5,Long but entertaining!,"Like all he other Harry Potter books on tape, The Order of The Phoenix keeps you entertained! Don't be fooled by how many tapes there are (17 I believe) because you will not be able to stop listening to them! Jim Dale does an AMAZING job of narrating and he is part of the reason why I love the Harry Potter books on tape so much. As for those who think Rowling added too much ""fluff"" to this book, they might be right. But I think the ""fluff"" only helps the reader (or listener in this case) understand the characters better. I don't consider it to be ""fluff"" at all-It's called detail :)"
4,Great!,"This book, the fifth in the Harry Potter series was good. The begining gets you asking questions, and, of course, we're all wondering who's going to die.I only gave it four stars because I couldn't get into in as much as I did the fourth book. The fourth book was so action-packed, it'd be hard to top.There was absolutly nothing wrong with the fifth, to tell you the truth, it answered almost as many questions as it brought up.If you are new to the series, don't start with this one. If not, you're in for at least a day of non-stop reading!"
4,"If you still bear the somewhat gothic ending...,","..of the 4th volume in mind, you might find yourself eagerly gulping down this one, searching for clue's of Voldemort's return.. But, I found myself breathlessly reading ... and ... reading ... and reading ... through almost 600 pages till the first encounter of the impersonated good and evil occured. It somehow felt like this whole volume was some sort of an interlude to prepare the grounds for volume 6, where the ultimate battle might begin.However, Rowlings storytelling is as terrific as ever, and I particularly enjoyed her side blows on the media and her empathetic description of the main characters maturing and experiencing teenager turmoil.Now I have no alternative but to wait impatiently for volume 6."
5,A Dark Wonderland,"I'm suprised no one else has written a review for this book, only what I must assume is the fact that people are afriad of giving away spoilers (for which I can totally understand, this book has been under lock and key!) I finished this book Sunday night and I must say this is by far the darkest of all the books so far - as you already know if you have read the reviews. I recommend that if you are reading this to little ones to read it yourself first and make sure your child can handel it. I am in my late teens and it was hard for me to cope with some of the situations involving my favourite characters. (I have a habit of becoming very close to characters, as I'm sure all who have read any of J.K.R.'s books can easily relate.)Please take this book with a grain of salt, but also enjoy the fabulous and wonderfully elaborate style of J. K. Rowling as you flip through 870 pages of her most exceptional piece of work yet."
4,Potter is Our King!,"Ok, I loved this book, but I have to say, that the person who was killed off, was a big dissappointment. I LOVED the book, so dont get me wrong, but I'm still not sure about the ending. Its deff. worth reading so, pick it up and give it a try."
3,A long and painful year,"For the first time since I discovered Harry Potter I was disappointed. Hogwarts has always been an escape for Harry-a place that he (and we) want to be. This year, for the first time, he'd rather be most anywhere else. The truly repulsive Professor Umbridge, Dumbledore being aloof and additional lessons with Professor Snape conspire to make Hogwarts an unattractive place. Even the usual escapes are not available this year.Harry is a charactor who's emotions guide us through the books. When he is happy so are we. When he is miserable, so are we. In this book his unhappiness is transmitted to us. I missed the joy that was so evident in other books and found it very difficult to finish this one."
2,not very good....,"I own all of the harry potter books, and of course, i bought this one. Order of the Phoenix was a huge let down. The story was incredibly boring in the beginning and end, and half of the events were pointless. If you like harry potter you could take your chances and buy this, but if you are just starting to read the series, read book number 2, because it is the best, and it is much better than this one."
3,A Turn for the Worst,"Well, for me I thought it was a little boring, I felt like the other 4 books were a whole lot better, but that's just my opinion. I Felt like Harry was feeling too sorry for himself, and getting jealous at his friends for have parents. And then there's Umbridge, she really got on my nerve, you can't really imagine her.. "" Frogged Face "" I personally, never saw someone with a Frog Face. Back onto Harry, I think Harry has too little flaws, and he's too "" perfect "" no one is like him, so you can bearly relate to him. His parents died, and Voldemort is trying to kill him.. Can you really relate to that? Unless your parents are dead, and there's some mad killer off to kill you, which I doubt because then you wouldn't have time to actully read this.I think if you decided to pick this up, just be warned it's not as good as the other 4. But who knows, this is just my opinion"
4,Love It! - especially there developing feelings,"I love it!I love how characters are starting to change. I found this very much in the Harry and Hermione relationship, where it is becoming somewhat ambigious in certain scenes about what they think about each other. This could set up a walloping triangle between the 3 principle characters. I also like the ""beginning"" rivalry between Hermione and Cho Chang. I hope that this rivalry develops even moreso in the next book.I am somewhat getting bored with all this ""scar"" business, so i would like J.K. to get rid of Voldemort at the end of book 6 and leave book 7 to be well open for a nice climax rivalry between Harry Potter and the evil, dreadful Draco Malfoy."
3,Too much teenage anst . . .,"Don't get me wrong this is still a very enjoyable read but to tell the truth I got a little impatient with Harry's continual temper tantrums. I mean I know he's 15 now and smack in the middle of the teenage anst period, but he seems to be the only one among the students unable to control himself. I've always liked the character before. He's been more or less typical of his age but always with a little something special - loyalty, bravery, nobility - that sets him apart and makes his showdown with You-Know-Who at the end of each book triumphant and believable. This time he comes off as a jealous, conceited know-it-all who can't believe he's not number one all the time. Maybe that's a little harsh, but I can't tell you how little I liked Harry in this book and how much it spoiled the story for me. I'm really hoping he'll get over it before Book 6."
5,I'm not 9-12 but I loved it!,"I got the book June 21st - and had a tough time putting it down. I know this was written for teens, but it is also a wonderful read for those of us still unwilling to grow up. I felt myself pulled into the book, reading deep into the night, fighting off sleep so I could keep reading. The characters continue to develope and change - there is nothing stagnant or dull about the Harry Potter books. And Harry continues to be an amazing boy. Now that I am done, I'll be reading it aloud to my children. Thank you, Ms. Rowling, for continuing to entertain us all! I am already looking forward to the next book!"
4,not the best,I believe that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix isnot the best of the HPs (Goblet of Fire was the best). Itwas a great book but it left a lot of questions hanging.Although it was intense and exiting it did not have themystery surrounding the other HP books. The plot was alsomuch weaker and less captivating then Harry Potter and theGoblet of Fire. I also wish that D.A. (you will understandwhen you read the book) had more of a role than it did. BUTHEY!!! IT'S A HARRY POTTER!!! READ IT!!
3,Not up to Snuff,"While my family and I spent a great deal of time reading this latest edition I must admit it was tooooo long. Come on editors please do your job. The plot was too tangled, Harry's character was too self involved, and come on the only quiddich game went on forever. How many versus of Ron is our king did we need to read! I believe that Rowling needs to remember that her main readers are children and many will not stick with the book to finish it. I hope the next book is better and more concise."
5,Excelente libro,"Me gustan la historias de aventura subreales. Este libro lo tiene todo, igual que los demas de la misma serie."
4,Harry Potter Grows Up,"As advertised, this book is by far the darkest of the Harry Potter series. At the same time, it seems that as Harry develops, so does Ms. Rawlings's writing style. While The Order of the Phoenix lacks some of the wide eyed wonder found in the first few books of the series, it does display a polished writing style and depth of plot that those novels lacked. This is not, however, necessarily a good book for younger children. It accurately captures a greeat deal of the agnst and anger of a teenager on the verge of adulthood, and deals extensively with the fallability of real human adults. This will probably make the character motivations more dificult for younger readers to relate to. It does, however, make it a much more satisfying read for both teens and adults. Overall, this is an excellent read and a well polished book, although it seems to lack much of the magic that first endeared Harry and Ms. Rowling to children and adults both."
5,Best Book yet: Fascinating,"In this book, everything comes together as we head twoards the climax of the series. Not only is Voldermort back, but so is sirius, Lupin, and Made-eye, who combine in a secret society to fight evil. While the ministry continues in darkness to conduct activities, this group called the Order of the Phoniex recognizes the undeniable fact that Lord Voldermort is back. Not only is this book fast paced, and a great sequel: it has a fascinating political scenario for the Wizarding world. Never before has fantasy been so well woven together with the regular world. A superb book for all ages, well their are some refrences to intimate parts of the body and swearing, it is always done in the most respectful and humorous way. A delightful Book."
5,A Book That Will Become Your Favorite,"J.K.Rowling is my favorite Author. I think she's very talented, and I admire her very much. Harry Potter #5 is my favorite book of all time. Why this book is so good, is because it makes you read on. Every chapter has so much suspense! Before I knew it, I had finished it in less than 3 weeks! I totally reccomend you to read this book, though if you haven't read any other Harry Potter books, I suggest you to read the first one, second, third,etc.ect."
5,Read the Series!,Always been a fan of the books. Love the new characters introduced. This book is a must read. Much better than the movie.
5,Potter is success,"I don't understand why people can't stand the book and that its aweful...yes it does take a while but you can't just ship him off to school without knowing what happens. i love this book, the third one and the fifth one are the most interesting. so get over the fact that yes it does take a while but you have to know whats going on before you actually read about him in school. i think that this is a great book and look foward to the sixth one...she did a good job."
2,Waste of Money,"Borrow this book from your local library. The reader learns almost nothing new about the characters, except maybe for Aunt Petunia, but the plot doesn't thicken past what we learned about Harry and Lord Voldemort in the fourth book.I understand that pubescent young adults go through a rebellious stage. But couldn't Rowling have given the progatonists an identity crisis to preserve what we like about them -- rather than make all of them plain angry and obnoxious? Harry and Ron were not likable. Authors of young adult books rarely make the characters obnoxious to indicate that they are going through changes. There are other ways to imply that. Oh well. We writers learn from each other's mistakes.Sirius and Lupine were flat characters with no personality, as were ALL of the other characters. This book was not loved by the author when it was being written."
3,Still satisfying,"This being the fifth installment of the Harry Potter series, I have come to notice many flaws in the overall writing of the story. It's length for one is unnessary. Most of the book is a jumble of redundentcies, which at times try to ""fill in"" the reader of the going ons in the book, however this intent was a comeplete failure. There is little room for thought about any of the main characters (especially Harry) because the reader is, constantly, informed of every inconsequential thought that happens to run through his mind. Despite these flaws, I felt that this book was worth reading, although I must say that the movies have certaintly ruined all the imaginative license I could have taken on this book, especially the appearance of the characters."
3,Harry's Fifth Adventure.... not so exciting,"I have read all the Harry potter books at least twice. I have to say all of them were better than the fifth one. J.K Rowling is a great author and to write five books takes a lot of time and effort. I do think that the fifth one was a little bland, boring, and uneventful. I felt like she kind forgot she was writing about the famous Harry Potter, I mean she made him have a horribly rude behavior, he had a hot temper, and he was inconsiderate and rude to his friends. Oh by the way I really liked Sirius why did she have to make him die, plus the way he entered the book was way cool and the way he had to live his whole life in hiding and always on the run. I think if she made him die she should have made him die doing something a little more exciting, have him die doing something courageous. Not fighting his cousin and then falling down a hole. I just hope the next book is worth 930 pages or however long it will be."
2,A BIT DULL AND NOT MUCH HUMOR LIKE THE OTHERS,"Did I read somewhere that J.K. Rowling had writers block and had a difficult time finishing this book? I just finished The Order of the Phoenix and was not all that impressed. It seems to me that her writing style changed- the ""spark"" just wasn't there. This book just didn't keep me captivated! I kept thinking it would get better but unfortunately it lacked the wittiness and humor of previous books. Hopefully the movie (whenever that will come out) will make up for it."
2,A big let down,"After waiting in line to buy this book I read it straight though without sleeping. I have to say I have never been let down more by a book ever. The plot wanders all over without advancing the story line, it was as though Ms. Rowling was writing for writing sake. I am sorry that I was so excited for this book to come out. I will not bother reading any more of her books."
5,Worth the wait!,"Rowling did a wonderful job with this book, especially with expanding Harry's emotions--he's much more angry in this book, but she captures him very well. After spending all day reading the book until I was done, I'm hoping she finishes the other two books quicker then this last one, but as she has a new baby, I can understand if it takes a while!"
4,standard not met in my mind,"the thing that drew me to harry potter more than anything was the depth of imagination that was put into the novel. i feel that this book was fascinating with the creation of dolores umbridge (who you absolultley want to kick in the face) and the development of harry's character.however...my sister finished the book before me and informed me of the trajic death which occurs. in a 870 page book, it seems awkward to refer to any single scene as ""rushed"" however it is my feeling that the topic was left very untouched. anyone else get that impression. i just thought she would have thought up more to go along with it.. maybe that is to come in book 6..... i sincerley hope so."
3,A little bit too tedious,"I thought this book will spend more efforts about describe the battle with dark lord. Anyway, my main disappointment is Sirius Black died. I really like him, he is handsome,smart, brave, really really love Harry, spent 12 years in prison, being on run for 2 years, trapped in his house for 7 months, and died in his first battle. I love him because he is more or less like human hero, that he has his flaws, but still very decent person."
2,Nothing new...,"The first Potter books were awesome, but this one seems to have little to offer in the way of new experiences, new magic, or new places. Rowling throws in contrived situations that seem to have no purpose in the story other than to fill in space. Also, she seems to have forgotten some of her own rules for the Potter world. For example, you can't free someone else's House Elves by giving them clothes, they have to receive them from their master!In this book Harry has become mean and thoughtless for the feelings of his friends. He is beyond rude to Dumbledore, something I can't believe the Harry of the prior books would have been.By the end of this book, I was ready to put it down. Overall, a disappointing read."
3,Not bad,"My hopes got really let down. As a long time Harry POtter fan, i was expecting something realy exiting, and somethin continiung with the plot line. This one has nothing to do with Hogwarts, but more about politics, and its not to fun to read. I didn't like many of the events that happened, and i don' know, it just wasn't what i explected... there is no solid plot line, other than the ministry is totally corrupted, and thats not too interesting to read about...its like JK rowling totally veers from the orginal hogwarts main setting, to know the ministry... its not too exiting, and i would not recomend it to that many people.. I think that the 3 year gha made a differece in how i looked at the book...."
4,Good but sad.,Sirius was one of my favourite characters. He was funny and really good! Why did he have to die! To make the story more interesting? Although I do like how harry gets the house eve though I hate that house.I love the Magic of Harry Potter. This Book was my favourite though. Anyway I'v always like Magic mixed with adventure. But only if this was real.This book is perfect for people who love to read! I reccomened it to everyone!!!
3,Okay...,"In this book, the first 150 pages are barely worth reading. You would think that after Volodemorts return, this book would be amazing and exiting, but you're wrong... The only intristing part is at the end...And some parts in the middle. Also, the book has to much info on Unibridge. Harry losses his temper alot in this book, its just not like him... This book okay. I mean if you see it at $10, buy it! ( six is way better)..."
4,"Well-written, but not as fun as Book 4","Like all the Harry Potter books, this is extremely well-written. Rowling does an excellent job of portraying real adolescence with all its frustrations and disillusionments. However, this one wasn't nearly as fun as Goblet of Fire. There is no quiddich match, considerably less humor, and a less compelling ending. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is an enjoyable book, but not Rowling's best work."
4,Most excellent,"I'm not going to spoil who dies for you, but it'll come as a bit of a shock. Don't believe any stupid Internet spoilers that came out before the book was released; they're all false.The book drags in spots, and be prepared for teenage angst. However, the action scenes are great, the new characters are excellent, and Harry finally get somewhere with Cho! I stayed up until 3 AM finishing this book, and don't regret it at all.Not as good as book 4, but excellent nevertheless."
1,Least of all Potter books,"I say I don't like this book not because of the superb story telling of JK Rowling but rather because of what's becoming of my favorite character. I've read all Potter books and I say this one is my least favorite. Harry has grown to become an arrogant brat while Ron, Hermione and the rest of the characters has retained their personality. Every 3 to 5 pages you'll come across Harry being upset and losing his temper over something non trivial. This book also dwelled more on his studies. There's really no action to this. The climax of the story is mediocre and short. A waste of pages If I must say. This won't make a good movie."
3,Irritating Harry,"You can certainly read this book..but at the end of the book you just want to slap Harry five times and beat some sense into him.. He's definitely not the Harry I remembered in the last four books. Somehow the older he grows the more immature he becomes.. Gone are the days when Harry just says ""It's Ok .. You don't have to say it"" so smoothly when Ron was about to apologize after doubting him with the Goblet of fire.. Now he's irritated, stupid and just cannot come to terms what the ministry is doing to him and Dumbledore..However the book is a good read, although it lacks the final twist characteristic of the previous four Rowling's works..It's definetly more dark.. That Umbridge is EVIL.. Ron, Hermione and Draco are their usual selves which is kind of consoling.. The OWLS reminds you of your exam days and makes you all nostalgic..If you're ready to excuse Rowling for making Harry such an annoying brat you should read it."
4,Great until the end,"This book I have to say was awesome. However, the end was not. They killed off Harry's only living family Sirus Black.It was still good but the other part that wa shocking wasHarry's attitude! He kept screaming at Hermione and Ron for something they didn't do. He does lighted up near the end. However it was a good book until the end.Just be ready for the end when you read this."
3,Rowling comes up with the goods,"I really want to give this three and a half stars, but there's no facility to do that.There's been a lot of bagging of J.K.'s latest works, and while it's true this is no ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Wizard of Earthsea"", ""Order of the Phoenix"" is a page-turner. After the first couple of books, the Harry Potter series was in danger of becoming another ""The Three Investigators"", i.e. a formulaic structure where the hero always wins. Hates living with the Dursleys (when will summer ever end?), finally makes it to school where a new Black Arts teacher is helping the evil Voldemort, Harry wins a quidditch game or two, etc.We know he's not going to die or be permanently maimed (there's at least two more books to come) so where's the inherent risk for the protagonist? But to J.K.'s credit the last two books have been about fleshing out her main characters and not just plot.Looking forward to the next one."
5,an emotional rollercoaster,"this is the first book ever to put me thru an emotional rollercoaster ride. In the beginning I wanted to throw the book out the window or burn it because of the anger I felt towards some of the characters. Then the suspense was killing me, then three quarters of the way thru I felt satisfaction and the last four or five chapters I cried not once.. but twice and with the last page I had an overwhelming feeling that harry was finally at peace.. for the time being. People may not like what harry is going thru but the author puts him thru LIFE, like it or not."
4,"boring start, but gets better","I have just finished reading 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', and I thought that the book started off slow, and until Harry got to Hogwarts, I wasn't constantly reading it, but when he gets to Hogrwarts the book starts to get really good, with their new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher being 'almost as bad as Snape', too much homework, and OWLs coming up, this is still a must read book."
4,"Another year, another duel","J. K. rowling has an obvious formula, Harry Potter is misunderstood but sincere, under attack by evil forces, the victim of his unpleasant Muggle family, and the book climaxes with, what else, a duel to the death (someone else's death of course) with Lord Voldemort. Lots of distraction in the form of the Weasley twins' new joke store, new magic animals, and new teachers.However, it is a good read, although I found the absence of Dumbledore throughout most of the story to be strange, I think he is one of the most interesting characters. Rowling has been compared to Dickens, and although her writing is not of the same quality, she shares with Dickens the ability to write a really satisfying, loooooong book that will keep you reading for several days.Too many tricks, not enough substance, but still interesting and enjoyable."
3,Too many annoyances,"Yes, the book kept my interest and I did not find it too long. But for me she doesn't know when to tone down the exaggerations that make the story unbelievable (give one accepts the magical world). So many characters are over the top that it is hard to accept that no one seems to notice. Draco and his father might as well have ""evil"" tattooed on their foreheads. Crabbe and Goyle could never have made it this far in the school, Snape's malevolence is getting really boring, it is unbelievable that an incompetent fool like Fudge is Minister of Magic, and the Inquisitor Umbridge is so extreme as to be totally unbelievable. Her books would be far stronger with a bit more subtlety."
2,In need of a firm editor,"As a big fan of the previous Potter books, I was disappointed by the latest installment. Somehwere inside The Order of the Phoenix is a decent addition to the series, but the trouble is, it's hidden away under pages and pages of dense and dreary drivel. The first third of the book could be binned without any loss, and there is a vast swathe in the middle that could also go. As for the new ""grown up"" Harry, well....not JK's strong point, writing about teenagers' love lives and tantrums. And rather pointless - we want a fast-moving, funny, action-packed ans surprising tale of a young wizard, not a dull story of Harry's first crush. I only hope that the next one is shorter and back to the point."
3,this book was ok,"i think this book was the best out of all the other harry potter books.it was more exciting and had more action, ..."
5,"Loved it, can't wait for 6","Entertaining as the last one, maybe more so. I love the details about day-to-day life at Hogwarts. The world that Rowling has created comes into light more and more and the detail becomes more visible as you read the books. I can almost smell the smells and feel the textures at Hogwarts. The characters, which were always well-developed and multi-dimensional, are even more vivid in Book 5. It's a great escape; she really transports you into their world. One minor warning: this is probably not appropriate for young or sensitive children. But for the rest of us, it's great."
3,Not great!,"After the fourth book I expected better. This was a good book but lacked the depth of story I wanted. The reader was led down a long depressing road and there were very few bright spots on the trip. Most fans of the series will already have buzzed through the 870 pages as I have; it is a quick read (maybe 15 hours). I have noticed others commenting on how quick they read it too. Like I said, not a deep storyline, just a lot of words."
2,Boring and desperately needing editing,"For uncritical youngsters, already immersed in the world of Harry Potter, this book continues to please.However, I found it very poorly written, with little memorable dialogue, repetitive scenes, and poorly constructed sub-plots (as pointed out by numerous other reviewers). Harry is essentially unlikeable in this book, with his constant complaining and self-pity. While that may be an important part of Ms Rowling's over-riding vision for the series, we don't need 800 pages of it!I very much hope that Ms Rowling allows an editor more input into her next attempt."
5,I absolutely loved this book!,"I, along with thousands, had been anxiously awaiting this book's arrival, and I have to say that the wait was worth it. I love it and I am thinking about reading it again, just to savor it.Along with book three, it's one of my favorites, and I am not ashamed to say that I cried when one of the characters was killed. This seems to have been the worst year ever for Harry.Now I guess I have to brace myself for another long wait, I just hope is not as long as the last one..."
5,longest so far of the series,"Once apon a time there was a wizard. In his 5th year at his school, Hogwarts, he was considered a lunatic by many advanced wazards for thinking a dark powerful wizard alive. I liked this book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, because Harry can see things other people can't. He also knows that Voldemort, a.k.a. You-know-who and He-who-should-not-be-named, is alive and trying to kill Harry. In his previous years he has encountered Voldemort. Once on his professor's head, once in his 17 year old self, and once in his new body. Harry also encounters many wizards including his old werewolf professor, Remes Lupin. Harry wants to kill Voldemort, but if he does will this be his last year at Hogwarts?"
5,Best yet!,"We've all been waiting breathlessly for this, and luckily the book lives up to expectations. Harry is a year older, a year wiser and like teen-agers everywhere, confused....not only about the his place in the world of magic, but about his relationships with his friends and particularly with girls. Rowling has done a wonderful job of showing us Harry and his friends as real people.Rowling has also introduced a fabulously annoying new villian. I slammed my book down in disgust several times when Prof. Umbrage was on the scene.Thr book is much darker in tone than the previous 4 and might be disturbing to younger children as things are not so neatly divided into good/bad as they have been in the past. If you are reading the book aloud I would suggest reading ahead so that you can discuss potentially disturbing events."
2,Oh come on....,"Out of the 5 Harry Potter books written so far, I definitely wouldn't say #5 is the best; personally, I feel The Goblet of Fire is the best. This is because it's the first book JK Rowling wrote that actually was descriptive and up to my reading level, at the time. The Order of the Phoenix, however, was a great disappointment compared to The Goblet of Fire. Though it was descriptive, it lacked a good plot. There was no point for the author to kill off Sirius Black -- the character had not yet been developed to his full potential. We had not yet had the opportunity to feel for the loss of the character as much as we could have if it had been one of Harry's friends who had died. It was also a sad thing that JK Rowling did with Harry & Cho Chang. The author never developed Cho's character enough for us to care if Harry ended up dating her or not. I still give the book a fair rating -- it was a good book except for those plot problems. I hope Book #6 is an improvement !"
4,A Really Good Book to Read,"I would really recommend Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix to any Harry Potter fan. Harry is back at Hogwarts for his 5th year, but there is a new teacher that is really mean and makes the school weird. She teaches according to th Ministry of Magic, which is different from the way the other students were previously taught. The way that J.K. Rowling writes this almost 900-page bookis very entertaining and interesting to read.She is really desccreiptive in her writing, but the book has so many pages. It also has a really sad ending. I can't wait for the next Harry Potter book to come out after reading this one."
5,NOT JUST ANOTHER HARRY POTTER!!,"People have mixed reactions to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. After reading customer reviews, most people are ""love it"" or ""hate it,"" but the fifth installment in the Harry Potter series is a great book. It is the longest book and it introduces the most characters and is the most in-depth story out of the four previous novels. Readers can begin to see Harry Potter not as the innocent, 11 year-old boy like in the first book, but as a teenager. He whines and complains more than ever before. Readers should not just read this book once, but over and over again (before the release of the next book July 16!) to see the subtle hints and clues that JK Rowling implants into her writing. Also, some people may not see the whole plot of this story because it is one piece of a series. The book by iteselt may not make complete sense without prior knowledge. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great book and anyone who loves Harry Potter will love this book!"
2,JK Rowling loosing her focus and her magic,"Three years of writing have led to a quite disappointing result:too many pages, not enough plot.In Harry's fifth year, both Voldemort and Dumbledore have chosen to take a one year leave. Voldemort forgets that he wants to seize power. Dumbledore that he should take some action to stop Voldemort.What did they do to reach these goals? If anything, it is not revealed in the fifth book.The book is not unpleasant to read, but it lacks the magic of ""The prisoner of Azkaban"" or ""The goblet of fire"", which combined a good plot with innovative spells and characters, both of which are surprisingly absent in ""The order of the phoenix""."
5,The Very Best Yet,"The Very Best Yet. Though the first fifteen pages of this book are excrucitatingly boring, after tha, the book flows remarkably well. You re-enter the world of Witchcraft and Wizardry to find that the world does not believe that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned. They believe Harry and Dumbledore to be liars, with the intent of overthrowing The Ministry. This sets up a rough year for Harry and his friends, as the ministry places a new DADA teacher they have selected, one who has the power to bring down Hogwarts for good...Defenitely worth buying. Read Read Read!!! Though the book leaves a lot to be expected, leaving you wanting more...do they all not leave you this way?"
2,Disappointing...,"After years of waiting I expected more from this book. I thought there was too much time spent on story lines that would never come to fruition, and of the 870 pages in the book everything significant seemed to happen in about the last 50 pages. The ending then came abruptly, as did the much awaited ""significant character"" death, to say the least. This book was, perhaps, over-anticipated and had no chance of ever meeting the expectations created in the years of waiting. I do feel this was a challenge created by the writer, herself, and she certainly did not meet it. I cannot help but be disappointed by this newest voyage into the world of Harry Potter. Until now I was able to forget that this literature was designed for children, unfortunately the immaturity of the literature, and perhaps the writer, was painfully clear. On the bright side, the wait for the next novel will be less grueling due to the low expectations I now have."
3,Order of the Phoenix,While reviewing what one reads he or she must see the story through the eye of the reader the book is aimed at. Harry Potter has caused more young people to start reading than just about any other book. Each child after starting to read the Harry Potter stories can not wait until the next story is out in print.This book in my eyes isn't as good as some of the first stories but it will keep the children reading and looking for the next book. For this reason this book is a must read for the child that is in love with Harry Potter and where he goes from here.
5,The best Harrry Potter Yet!,"This book is so much darker and angrier than the previous ones, but the writing level seems more mature and confident. JK has a way of luring in the reader into a completely fictious world of her creation and makes us believe that the charaters and events are alive and happening. I applaud JK for not bowing to pressure and fame and taking her time to deliver her best work to date. It would have been easy for her to rest on her laurels and write a ""formula"" book, but she seemed to have put her heart and soul into this book. Congratulations JK!"
5,Great book,"I have read the Harry Potter books 8 times each and am not sick of them. They are very creative, especially the 5th book. My mom forbids me to read the series (again) until the 6th book comes out, which seems a million years to me, even though it is just tomorrow. I strongly advise anybody who likes to work their eyes to read this NOW!!"
5,gotta luv it,i reddit so fast i had to read it the first day or it wouldn't count this si what reading is all about to do it now now now now now!!!!!!
3,"OK, but not worth the wait","Like most TV sitcoms, in the end everyone winds up back where they started and we're ready for another installment all over again. Oh sure, one auxiliary character is thrown away; but no matter how dramatic the climax may look she still managed to pick a character that none of us have any emotional investment in. The only interesting sub-stories are the comic relief provided by Fred and George and the various romantic relationships of main characters. Considering the audience, my guess is that nothing shocking will occur in the romance department. Oh well. The truth is that no matter what happens with the plot as long as the main characters stick around I'll keep coming back for more."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I have loved all the Harry Potter books up until now. It wasn't until I was almost 3/4 of the way through it before anything happened-and really, not much ever did happen! The change in Harry's personality was not believable, the storyline was a stretch in many ways and the characters were very weak in this book. It was as though Ms. Rowling really didn't know where she was going with this book and just rambled along. Please, Ms. Rowling, take your time with book #6 and give your readers quality, not quantity."
3,............,"This book was so/so. It was Very confusing, and i would get lost all the time. Umbridge.....she was dumb, i hated her. Harry was always so crabby too, he was never nice to Ron and Hermione. And fimally the mysterious death everyone was talking about.....so sad, why did that person have to die, why couldnt it be malfoy or something. The good part was it kept me doing something all summer, it was so long.Another good part wa sI found out a lot of things about Harry's Past and his Parents. All in all, it was ok, not the best, just okHope this review was helpful"
2,the wait was too long for too little,"I thought that this book was well written, however was far too long and the promised climax never came. The book seemed to continue almost indefinately with very little plot or substantial story development. I was very keen to read it, and I will still read the rest of the series however I found this a very long and disappointing read."
5,Done with Harry for now,This is the best yet. I emerged immediately into a much needed fantasy world. I only close the book for necessities. Can't wait for the half blood Prince
4,Great,"Wow--- That's all I need to say to describe it, I bought a book at 12:01 last night and read it all morning. I finished it 5 minutes ago. Wonderful book. A must have buy,"
5,Awesome.,"Stayed up all night reading it--well worth it, even though it took me from 12:05 - 8:24 a.m. Incredible book; revealed quite a few interesting pieces of information about the connection between Voldemort and Harry. Don't want to give away too much at the moment (not that I could, my head's spinning from the caffeine), so I will just say that it was a truly amazing book, and that it was well worth the wait."
5,It lived up to expectations -- and surpassed them,"Better than #4, better than #3, better than #2, almost as good as #1. Darker in tone, and more mature, but this is to be expected as both Harry and his readers are getting older. I couldn't put it down. Anyone who thinks the Harry Potter books are ""kid stuff"" will lose that misconception after they read this. I normally shy away from fads and popular series like I would from blast-ended skrewts, but these books are as good as they're made out to be, and this is one of the best. Read it!"
3,Not My Most Favorite HP Book,"I don't hate this book, but at the same time, I don't care for it that much. There are some parts that are very well-written, I'll admit that; but altogether, I'd say this installment of the series is only satisfactory. There were definitely some portions of this book that I could have done without.Probably the worst part of all is the very end--but I'm not giving away any details. You'll have to read the book for yourself, and when you reach the end, you'll see what I mean. I'm not dissing this book, but I'm not praising it either. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give ""The Order of the Phoenix"" a six-and-a-half."
5,Reading It,I am reading it right now. I am on about the 33rd chpter and am enjoying it. It is so good! Better than any of the books I've read yet and probably the best book I am ever going to read in my life!
5,Harry Potter,"This is the second time I,'ve read this book. I enjoyed it very much the first time and planned to read it again. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age!"
3,Not the best nor worst of the series,"J.K. Rolling does an excellent job of using detail when it is not needed and crams more fact than is neccissary in each chapter. Towards the end however, her writing style dramatically shifts and when the detail is neccissary it is not there at all. this book I would rate second to the Goblet of fire."
5,Outstanding!,"Well Rowling never fails in her efforts! This book was just as wonderful as the other 4. I am rereading the entire set again! I look forward to number 6 also. This book seems to be a linking book for the inevitable that is to occur in the next 2 books. I am hoping her reference in part of the story leads us to hopefully believe we will see more of Harry beyond his years at Hogwarts! :-) I feel that that her style of writing as always has a purpose and not all over the place as some reviews have stated. She has defined a different world than most could imagine and keeps us up to date with that world and seems to have the insight as to how the various ages of children would react, from Ron's being mad about newby fans of his favorite Quidditch team to Harry's selfish behavior in other parts. (Don't you think by now he deserves to be a little self-centered considering all he has endured.) Anyway a wonderful read just keep them coming Ms. Rowling! :-)"
2,pleeeeeeeeeez read!,the reason i rated this book so low is because i think it is just to dark ! books 4&5were(i think)really dark and shifty i think some happy things need to happen like ron and hermione go out or somthing.pleeeeez dont get me wrong i likrd the book but i almost stopped reading it cuz i was tired hearing how everything went wrong with harry potters little perfect life i mean i think j.k. rowlings made him very selfish and self absorbed!same thing in book 4!
3,I think it's OK.,Frankly I think the Potter series is getting quite tiresome. This is like the other ones but we are just so used to the stuff that we almost expect strange things to happen and it does.
4,Has Harry Peaked?,"I'm an adult fan of the Harry Potter books and I bought the 5th book on it's publish date (although I didn't stay up all night or wait in a line) and read it the following day. While it was an enjoyable day escape, it didn't grip me the way the first 4 books did. I kept waiting to laugh out loud, cry or tremble like I had before. While I did occasionally chuckle and I felt some sadness now and then, this segment of the tale seemed to lack much of the action and suspense of the other books. I wanted to see and understand a wider range of Harry's emotions - throughout this tale he just seemed angry. Still, Rowling is a crisp writer and the tale moves smoothly along. There are some delightful and creative new characters. I highly recommend the series and this book will surely play an important role in understanding the final two books."
1,Not the best.,"I found this to be a rather bland, boring, book. Some of it was intresting, but Harry's constant nightmares and temper tamptrums just killed it. Professor UmBridge just made me want to strangle her, that evil woman! Perhaps the worst part was Harry's crush on Cho Chang. I just found that to be sickening and repetitive. Speaking of which, here's a humorous alternate scene I've written that goes on the same theme. If anything it helps lighten it up a bit.(...)"
1,This book is so poor it's unbelievable,"Okay so we waited forever...FOR THIS GARBAGE!. Harry was so THICK in this book even my 13 year old brother said it was garbage! I have a feeling that the book was written more for the movie than for the purpose of being a 'good reading material'. Harry was so rude, whiny and over-bearing it's unbelievable, and at the very end Dumbledore appeared to be a blabbering idiot allowing Harry is temper tantrums. There were a few bright spots in the book, Ron being prefect and NOT Harry. And the 'spark' that started in Book 4 with Ron and Hermione seems to dwindle just a little and what'swith 'weeping Cho'. Believe I have three brothers and they were never that THICK, LOUD, STUPID, RUDE or WHINY in the teen-age years!...I hope the next book is some redemption,and as for the book being dark... please someone had to die it would seem unfair!"
3,I wish I didn't need to wait this long,"May be it's the waiting that heighten my expectation ( by too much). Don't get me wrong, the book is good, and JK Rowling is a good writer ( as always), but there seems to be A LOT in the book - actually a bit too much that make it seems dragging on (and ""all over the place"") . I guess ( or I hope) that's because the author needs to lay down enough hints to lead up to book 6 & 7. Anyway, the book is full of non-eventful events, the best part is the very end, when some ¡actions¡ really took place¡K Comparatively speaking, I still love the previous 4 books in the HP series more ( esp book 3 & 4) and I am still looking forward to Book 6 to come."
5,it is great,"i havent finished it yet, but i am loving it so far, it is a masterpiece! Grabs you right into the book!! i am in love"
5,The best one yet!,"This is the darkest and, I think, best Potter book yet. It is excellent, and not at all in the same ""format"" as the last ones. Harry is now 15 years old, and has the temper tantrums, confusions, frustrations with authority, feelings of unfairness, anger, and girl-problems of a typical 15 year old. I found myself frequently frustrated and angry (like Harry is) with the stuff that keeps happening to him-but things aren't necessarily ""made right"" immediately-he has to suffer. The situations he finds himself in are dark and teach very good lessons about holding one's tounge and how life is frequently not fair. There is very little focus on Quidditch and in the end they don't get into a silly little bind that seems too easy to get out of (even though you know they will.)It is really a very well written book. At times frustrating, at times funny, and full of heart and people I really feel I know. Great character development. A must-read. Really."
3,A must read but not because the book itself's good,"It's the first novel I read in English.Lots of times I had to look up words in English.That's an interesting experiance to me.But now let's come to the book.Other Harry Potters has got something special each.The Sorceror's Stone created a brand new magic world;The Chamber of Secrets is exciting and the Prisoner of Azkaban made me frightend and moved.In Goblet of fire the war started.And the half-blood prince has the most surprising end.What about the Order of Phoenix?I'm afraid there's nothing special.Of course we have to read it so we can read the half blood prince and the coming books.And the fighting in the department did bring me the feeling when reading other Harrys,but I was hoping to have more such feeling."
3,Harry Potter the fith book,"J.K. Rowling is a very good writer, in my opinion. Has any one noticed that her stories keep getting darker and longer. not that its a bad thing but Harry is hardly ever happy in the stories anymore. I know that his life has had a lot of tragetiesin it but come on man you have to get over it and move on with your life. i have found that the books are okay its just that the fith one is actualy kind of boring but you can decide for you self."
5,"So good, but over too quickly for me","I've been reading almost steadily since I got the book and I just finished it. Devoured it, more likely. In a way I wish I hadn't read it so quickly because who knows how long the wait for the next book will be. Anyway...on to my review. So many mysteries are cleared up and yet others are still there. The biggest battle so far ensues. Harry feels much of the angst that any other 15 year old would feel as well as everything else that is added to his burden. Great to see some of our old friends again. Several heart-stopping moments. Some teary moments. I'm not going to write any spoilers since the book is still just out. But it was fantastic."
3,Soaring Through Magic,"A series following the other four, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, is new and refreshing. In this magical book it seems Harry's friends, family, classmates, and the rest of the wizard world, including the Ministry of Magic, are against him. J.K. Rowling yet again writes a very terrific book. I like the fact that one of my favorite characters is in this one, Sirius Black. He's my favorite character because he has a mystic and mischievous look about him. I would recommend this and the other four books to anyone who has an imagination and anyone who likes to leave this world for a dream one."
3,"a good read, but not earth-shattering","Honestly, I liked ""the order of the phoenix,"" but I guess that I was just expecting it to be better; less predictable, less repetitive. It seemed to me that some of the characters attitudes, including Sirius's and Harry's, were a little forced. Being an adolescent myself, I found Harry's change in attitude a little too stereotypical. Besides that, there's the annoying plot hole involving the mirror that Sirius gives harry, who never uses it, for some bizarre reason. Anyhow, overall, it was good read, and I'll be waiting for book 6, just like everyone else."
1,She killed ...,Well well well. ... The author killed the character we all loved and turned him into a stupid guy. While making one foolish decision after another.The book could start on page 750 and end on 820. The rest of the book is long and BORING.
1,Downfall,"This book is a downfall after the other Harry Potter books. You would expect something nice and exciting, right? Well this book doesn't give you it. All this book is is description, no action. The other Harry Potter books were good, even if not great. But this book is horrible. I would never recommend this book to anyone. I'm sorry if you find this insulting, but it's the truth."
1,Unnecessarily long and bland,"This book is not at all like the first one, which is very imaginative and interesting. It is very boring and felt it was unnecessarily elongated. It was too cliched and you can feel the author's fatigue all around. She does not need to make it this huge, if she can keep it precise and interesting."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!,I loved the other books. This one is terrible. I could not get through this book. It is sooo boring. I stopped at the middle of the book. The book mentions Professor Umbridge like 3000000000000 times...talk about annoying. And Harry acts like my one-year old brother when he is in a very bad mood.
2,Wait for the movice,"Don't waste your time with the books...go see the movies. I read the first four books before the movies came out and wished I hadn't. J.K. Rowling spends an inordinate amount of time on filler material. In ""The Goblet of Fire"", we had to endure Ron's anger towards Harry for way too many pages. All right, he was mad. GET OVER IT! In ""The Order of the Phoenix"", it was Harry's anger over not being told what was going on. Again, GET OVER IT! Her books don't have to be 700 or 800 pages to tell a story. I love to read, but in this case, I prefer the movies to the books."
3,The most depressing book I've ever read...,"I'm an adult that has been awed by the fantastical series that Rowling has created. However, The Order of the Phoenix is what I'm here to talk about. I must say that while reading it I had the desire to read until the end, and it had a few really great moments. Somehow, though, it left me wondering if I really want to read the last two books at all. It was terribly depressing, so I definately don't recommend it to children. Seeing how violent it was also would deter me from letting anyone under 13 reading this book.On the positive side, I still have some regard left for Rowling, and as I said before there was enough in it to keep me reading until the end. I suppose that the end gives some satisfaction, but there certainly isn't any closure. This book simply poses more questions."
5,Best Book EVER!!!!,"I thought this book was the best out of the other 6 books. Harry is having an internal conflict with his feeling, and having and major problems oat school. The Ministry of Magic is now interfering at hogwarts and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher has it in for Harry. How will Harry handle it. Read to find out :)"
4,Good Book,"While listening to this book, I found Harry to be very easy to relate to. In this book he is in a difficult position and his emotions are getting the best of him and I think we can all relate to that type of situation. After my father died I read these books for the first time and I found a lot of comfort from them."
2,"On Harry Potter Scales, Bad!","If I were to rate Harry Potter 5 out of all the books, 5 being the worst, this is 5!There was really no main theme in this book like the other ones in the series. The ""order of the phoenix"" didn't really lead to a thrilling ending like the rest of the books.Going from Harry Potter 4 to 5 was a HUGE difference. For me, The 4th book was the absolute best, but the transition from the two books was just awful.If you're a Harry Potter fan, read this just to say you did, but you won't get much out of it! I personally hope the 6th one will be a lot better!"
2,"Long, Winding and Almost Pointless","Is JK being paid by the word? I read the first half of the book before realizing nothing had really happened and the point of the plot was no where to be found. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book but it is overly long and more on par with the quality of the first or second book and well below the gripping suspense of the 3rd and 4th books.Overall this book reminded me of a lot of middle books in three part trilogies. They are continuations of the first book but really only filler setting up the third book. This was a lot of filler with a rather lame excuse for a plot and ending."
1,"Sorry, but it went for the chop.","Book five I was looking forward to and later dissappointed me. The Harry in this latest book is completely different: angry, bitter, and depressing. Not the loyal, honest guy he was in the previous four books. J.K. Rowling must've worn out her caplock key on her keyboard just from all that yelling in the script. I doubt I would read it again, I didn't see why Sirius died just because he was thrown behind a curtain! Knocked out maybe, but die? I didn't see the point.I agree with other one star reviews which said that it seemed to be more about quantity than quality. If the other books keep going downhill, J.K Rowling's fame may also come tumbling down right behind them."
2,Rowling is losing her touch,"Is it just me, or do these books get increasingly filled with fluff in each successive book?I thoroughly enjoyed the first few books, even the fourth book maintained my attraction despite it's ridiculously long monologue at the end.What's the problem with this one? It's just a teenaged-fantasy soap opera for 80% of the book! NOTHING interesting happens until the very end, which in itself was short of satisfactory. I was expecting every little tidbit and subplot to make full circle (as she so cleverly did in her previous books) but nothing.I hear the 6th book makes up for this disappointment. I hope they're right, 'cuz i'm pretty close to waiting for a DVD rental of the movie. That's right! I said it! lol"
3,So/So,"I love the Harry Potter stories. What a wonderful imagination this author has but, the Order of the Phoenix let me down a little. I did not like the grim depressing feeling this book gave. I understand that the book needed to take this turn somewhat as the Dark Lord is back but, I feel that there could have still been some fun times and a few good things could have happened to poor Harry along the way. It is a little complex for younger readers but gets the point across that Mrs. Rowling was going for. Do not expect any lighthearted fun in this book. Now that it has been proven that V..... is back I only hope that some fun times can be had even though the war to kill him will be started soon."
3,It was Okay,"I love the Harry Potter series, but was disapointed by this installment. I think it was very slow, unsuspenseful and there are far to many pointless characters and sub-plots that go nowhere. The ending was very anticlimactic and I didn't find out anything about Harry or Voldemort that wasn't in the previous 4 books. I hope that this book leads up to something great in the 6th book."
2,potter and bureaucrats,"This book has harry potter battling the bureaucrats. if you think that bureaucrats don't make for interesting villians, you are absolutely right! Lacking in storyline, the author tries to fill the pages with Potter's constant yiping and gnashing."
3,Less than Stellar,"The begining of the book was aimless and rambling. It wasn't until the last 300 pages that it started to get interesting. Professor Umbridge's introduction brought no real substance to the story; her character was annoying and pointless. It seemed as though Rowling was stalling for time until she could produce something up to the standards that her readers were used it. She comes close but misses ever so slight. I believe Rowling let the pressure of producing the next installment get to her. Even though the begining was disappointing, the ending does slightly make up for it. This isn't complete drivel, but the coupling of the hype put on the book, and the pressure put on Rowling to produce an ending to the series contributed to this less than stellar piece of writing. For Rowling sake, I hope she takes the time to rediscover her inspiration for writing the first four books before she tackles the sixth, and seventh books."
4,"Not a letdown, that's for sure","I was hesitant going into this latest installment in the Harry Potter series, since I didn't want to fall into all the hype and just read the book because it WAS Harry Potter. However, I loved all the other books in the series, and was hoping J.K. Rowling hadn't given into editor pressure or fame and written a ""made-for-movie"" novel. I was not disappointe. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is a more mature, yet still lovable book with more character analysis than the previous books, and more room for possibility. J.K. Rowling sure knows how to write an entertaining, imagnative book, and has me expectantly waiting for the next one to come out!"
5,Worth the Wait in Line!,"The first review!? Here in San Jose, CA we had to wait in line for an hour to pick it up, but it was worth the wait. These books have a special meaning to me and my wife. Three years ago we went to New York City for a vacation and I brought an engagement ring along with plans to propose after dinner at the top of the World Trade Center. All that day and even during the ride back to the hotel after dinner, all she wanted to do was read Harry Potter. I had to take it away from her just to ask her to marry me!"
4,"Unfortunately, not as entertaining as the previous four","Overall, the fifth Harry Potter is worth the looong read, but I have to say, I was not as riveted to the book as I was reading the previous four. I found the story to be a bit uninvolving and uncreative and consequently, not as fascinating. Harry faces the same sort of trial and tribulations (although in different contexts) as he has in the past, and at times I felt a bit bored just reading ""more of the same."" The previous four books were almost like great mystery novels to me ... while the mystery in this book seemed to be very ordinary. Maybe I'm just getting old, or the movies contaminated me, or after three years of waiting my expectations are now unrealistic, but overall I thought this book was a notch below the rest. (it could also be that three years later I don't have the girl that introduced me to Harry Potter to share the reading with anymore .. so take that into mind when considering this review!)."
1,Was not worth the wait,"I had very high expectations for this book, because I loved the 4 preceding it. However I think Ms. Rowling does not really know where she is headed with this series, it just gets more and more rambling. The teenage romance was cliched and derivitave. I did not want Harry to be ""angry"" coming into the book like I heard he would be, but it turns out it was more ""disgrunted"" than ""angry"" and of course, Mr. Potter is so politically correct, its less ""disgrunted"" and more ""whining"". Oh well...hopefully book 6 will be better :)"
2,"HP#5: lots of blood, and Harry is mad at everyone all the time. Oh yeah, and a little magic.","I waited for weeks (more like months) so I could finally read #5. I read up to about the third chapter and already felt sorely disappointed. When I finished, I was tempted to look through every page and try to find a scene where Harry WASN'T mad at the whole world. And there is far too much blood. You might enjoy it if you like PG-13 movies, but this is no longer a series to read to your kids before bed."
3,Quantity is not quality.,"Long and, at times, boring, a lot of fluff making it a tedious read. Quantity is not quality."
3,Disappointing,"Harry Potter and the Order of the phoenix is very disappointing. I have looked forward to reading this book for years and couldn't believe it when I got hold of a copy. The book didn't measure up to my standards. J.K. Rowling writes very vividly and enraptures her readers, however book five was boring and uneventful. I am not sure whether I just grew up or the book wasn't very good."
4,"Slow to start, but once it gets going hold onto your hats...","I'll try to avoid any spoilers.The book suffers from the same thing that Attack of the Clones did. It gets off to a slow start, but once it gets going hold onto your hats.It is really dark in the beginning and everyone was miserable and fighting. We all knew it was going to be a dark book, but I think it was overdone. With the next two supposed to get even darker, I can't help but wonder if Rowling is about to alienate her audience who don't want their children reading it. Is there a PG-13 or R rating coming up for future movies?The ""Final battle"" is absolutely amazing. I couldn't put it down for the last 150 pages or so. Rowling out did herself with that. Her writing, from the start of the book just keeps getting better and better. There are a lot of plot twists that you never would have guessed.I just wish the first half of the book was as intriguing (and interesting) as the last."
4,"Worth the wait, but...","This is another page turner; I read it almost non-stop. As always, the story is excellent and the characters are well painted. However, it is very long, and I think it could have been trimmed a little to maintain a better pace.Harry is now a real teenager, and has lost his innocent charm. It would not be realistic to play down his growing up, but there is no longer a sense of wonder and delight at sharing Harry's discoveries. There is a serious purpose to his studies, and this creates a very dark mood.Much older themes are dealt with than previously, especially dangerously inept authorities, and how nobody is entirely good or evil (except Voldemort and the Malfoys of course). I would not recommend this for anyone under 11, not because of sexual or violent content, but for concepts that require more experience of life than younger readers will have."
2,I got my hopes up...,...but I was very disapointed when I finally got to read the book. I have loved all of the other books in the series. The fifth one just lost its touch. In the begining Harry was totaly miserable. In the middle Harry was totaly misreble. In the end Harry was totaly misreble. There was no style just Harry not knowing what was going on. JKR should have made him at least match the personality that he was at the end of the fourth book. At the end of the fourth book it was like he was getting ready for some huge battle and then in the fifth book all he did was sit around and get tortured by some teacher
5,Spectacularly Written!,"I just recently finished the newest installment in the Harry Potter series and I feel like J.K. Rowling has not let me down. This masterfully written book takes you into a whole new world for Harry. Once I started I couldn't put it down. Indeed, I feel like this is the best Harry Potter book yet. I was immediately drawn in to the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially Harry's fans."
3,The worst book in the series,"This is not to say the book is bad, it is not, but it gets off to a very slow start, and much of it is consumer with Harry's self-pitying whining and adolescent anger at anything and everything - certainly not the most entertaining subjects to read about. The plot is what one might expect, neither surprising nor disappointing, but the sense of wonder and excitement that pervaded the other books in this series is greatly diminished. Still a good book, worth reading, but I hope the 6th is better."
5,Best Harry Potter book yet!!!,"This books is the best in the series. It shows Harry as a teenager, and he is starting to question a lot of things that he never questioned before. He doesn't like how the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere with Hogwarts, and that no one believed him when he told them that Voldemort is back. This is without a doubt the best Harry Potter book, it takes you deeper into the story, and the magic is darker. I finished this book withing two days of recieving it. I can't wait until J.K. Rowling releases her 6th work of art!"
3,Disappointed,"After waiting sooo long for the next installmant of Harry Potter, it was a real disappointment. It was cool that we got to go back to Hogwarts to see all our friends, but the story didn't really advance any. At this point Harry is in exactly the same place he was in at the end of year four only minus one more important person in his life. Nothing in book five resolved any part of the story line. It is as if book four was an 800 page cliff hanger and book five is a 900 page set up for book six."
2,Long and Disappointing,"I loved the other books in the series and really looked forward to this one. I enjoy JK Rowling's creativity, and wish she had come up with a more creative plot line in this one. It should have been edited more. It was disappointing to read so much to be left with such a disappointing ending. It seemed silly to have a whole book in the series based on characters making stupid mistakes. So far, my rating of the series is as follows from favorite to least favorite: 3 & 4 are tied for favorite, then 2, then 1, then 5 very far last. I hope 6 & 7 are better. I'd give the second, third and fourth books in the series 5 stars, the 1st book 4 stars and the fifth book 2 stars."
3,Cry baby,"In what has been a very good series in the past, the most recent addition seems a bit whiney. Harry seems to want everyone to feel sorry for him. He spends half the novel complaining that no one understands him and everyone is ignoring him. The other half is spent pining after Cho. When is Harry going to figure out that Snape is not his enemy? The Dark lord does make a token appearance, but Umbridge is the real story. This is the worst book of the series but it is a great series and one of them had to be the worst. Let us just hope Harry straitens himself out in time for year 6."
5,A brilliant book,After reading this book i have established that it was one of the best books i have ever read and i can't wait until the next book comes out. Straight away your into the book and Harry hasn't even got to school yet. Every single sentence keeps you wondering whats going to happen next....
4,harry potter a new order,"Harry Potter, the boy who lived is back for his fifth year at Hogwarts. This time new challenges await him, a secretive order, new monsters, and a strict new teacher trying to over throw the headmaster are of the first of his worries. Now Harry must survive all these challenges along with the things that a new army will bring to the dangers of being on a mass killers most wanted hit list."
