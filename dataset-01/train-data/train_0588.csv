2,LASTED A MONTH PAST WARRANTY,"After reviewing and deciding to buy this unit, I was satisfied with the performance until 13 months after buying....wont turn on out of standby. The problem is, it is cheaper to buy a replacement than get fixed based on labor and parts. However, my next unit will not be a JVC as the timing at one month out of warranty is not a good sign."
1,disappointing,"Nice small design, but with problems. Like some of the reviewers. when it gets into about one hour of play, it starts skipping and superimposing. Now I have to have it serviced. I thought it was the dvds, but its not"
2,Very disappointing!,"As soon as it was out of the box and an hour into a movie, it starts messing up, freezing, blocks, etc. Certain chapters almost always messed up on all dvd's we tried to watch and a brand new Disney dvd ""101 Dalmations"" the JVC wouldn't even play it at all! Also, seemed the more info the dvd had on it, the worse problems it had. (Small Sample disc's worked great) Maybe we got a defective JVC...but we ended up with a Sony that plays All our dvd's and plays them with no problems."
2,Skip this one,"Nice picture and features, but could not play DVDs that other players had no problem with"
5,Plays All Writeable Media Types So Far...Awesome!!,"This DVD player is loaded with great features - progressive scan with component outs, MP3 and JPG ability. The thing I love about it is that it didn't have any trouble reading the my burned DVDs or CDs. So far I've this player has succeeded in playing DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVDR+RW, CD-R, CD+RW, VCD, and SVCD. You get zoom and also 16x9 modes and picture tweaking from gamma, to color to sharpness. There's strobe viewing and 30 disc memory resume. There are a few negatives: 1. you can't shuffle the mp3 so listening is linear all the way through. 2. JPG viewing is VERY slow. 3. No DVD-R MP3 ability, though I doubt any players (aside from some apex models) even support this right now. This is the best player within its price range and its compatiblity with all DVD media types is worth 5 stars alone."
5,enjoy!,"I purchased this DVD to use as music during my church's Seder dinner, and it worked well. I have always loved his voice, and it is just as good as it was years ago in Sound of Music."
2,Boring and not engaging at all,I am always hesitant to order CDs and this is why. Reviews were good but this cd is not engaging at all for my child. She loves guitar music but this is just boring. We didn't even finish it and I don't see us going back to it later since I didn't enjoy it either. Oh well.
5,Sourcebook of classic Quantitative Analysis techniques,"This is the go-to source of inorganic quantitive chemical analysis techniques by ""Heavy Ed"" Haenisch of Wabash College and peers from two other institutions (Cornell, perhaps?); first edition goes back - if memory serves - to the late 1930s. But this stuff is timeless.Book is clear, concise, and uses widely available materials.We cried, screamed, and pulled out our hair in Chem 4 over the fastidious techniques required to analyze specimens with low concentrations of mixed salts, or to maximize conservation of our samples. But the book always had the answers, even if found only post mortem.Timeless."
3,Big Larry Gonick fan..but..,"...know squat about physics...and even after getting this book, still don't..Gonick throws formulas at you almost from page one...I got lost right off the bat...Gonick's history books and his enviroment book I am quite fond of, but this one..not so much.."
4,good,"Organization was just like a physics text. Sections were good and funny, but it did not take the subject much further than a standard high school text."
3,A Teacher's View of The Cartoon Guide to Physics,"I'm an elementary school teacher and am in the process of reading this book with the possible thought in mind of recommending for use by my sixth grade student. Conclusion: forget it. Yes, the cartoons are ""really cool"", but the math and the thought processes involved are way beyond the level of the typical sixth grade student. In fact, I believe that most middle school children would have problems with the math part of it unless they were well grounded in algebra.It seems to me that this book is just a catchy way to sell a trite book."
1,cartoon guide,This book contains a plethora of amusing cartoons but the word guide is very misleading. This book does not contain any useful information for anyone seeking guidance or helpful hints about physics.
1,Difficult guide to Physics,"I bought 3 of Larry Gonicks cartoon books History of the universe, Cartoon guide to Physics and Chemistry. All 3 books are very difficult to read. I took intro physics in college and yet I found Larry's books difficult and uninteresting. I found that the same for History of the universe as well as the Chemistry one by the same author. I bought it 3 months ago, took 1-2 read and left it on the shelves untouched. A complete waste of money. Will be happy to get rid of it at half price. greatplaces@yahoo.com"
2,The most inaccessible of Gonick's books,"I got this for our 5th grade son after he hoovered up cartoon history of the universe and cartoon guide to genetics (both great). This book was unfortunately way beyond him, and on reading it myself I'm surprised at Gonick's approach here- this is basically an introductory college physics book drawn in cartoon form. I'm not sure what audience this would appeal to. In terms of appealing to kids with physics, Carl Sagan and Cosmos still do it best."
5,Finally!,"I was a lousy science major in high school. Looking back, I have no idea why I chose the subject I did anyway. The point is, I never understood half the stuff we were going through. Now, 10 years later, I've forgotten the few things I did understand.Thanks to the magic of Larry Gonick I get now get it! At first glance it still looks hard. They really dive right in with formulas and stuff, but after a little while it feels natural. I just wish my teacher back then had put this book in my hands. Or maybe I just gave Gonick the chance I never gave my teacher. Either way, this was an enjoyable read!"
5,Doodle Art should be available in Australia,"I loved this poster, and colored it while confined in a cast. I got so many compliments from my Australian friends, I could have sold dozens of them. Please tell Doodle Art to sell to someone in Australia."
5,Islam means peace for Muslims - Dealth to infidels and Jews,"Paul Sperry hit the nail dead on. This was a great read. I speak Arabic and have read the Koran in its original text. It is a violent journal of conquest written by The Prophet Mohammed (Mohamed). Several tidbits -Christians and Jews are mentioned in the Koran to be converted or killed and if allowed to live in a country prior to death or conversion I assume they are to pay tribute(essentially a tax on exsisting). Americans and Western Europeans have such a short memory- The Balkans - Muslims were stopped there from further conquest by Catholics. Chrsitian in Africa are still fighting Muslim Jijaweed- Devils on horseback who rape, plunder and conquest. Extremist Islamist can easily parade as moderates and have infiltated levels of Intelligence in our Government."
1,Muslims-The New Jews,"If you believe the 'official' version of events,if your a racist,hatefilled idiot,this book is for you. Muslims are the newest of America's ""boogeymen"". I do not reccommend this 'book' for anyone with a functioning brain."
1,Wow! what a bigot!,"This book is a mish-mash of items which are either atypical, or taken out of context, and generalized about all American Muslims. Pure McCarthyism."
3,We need to be aware,"This book and others like it, are needed to examine Islamic fascist threats to our society. I've read better, and I've read worse.Note to the reviewer who claims christianity has never been threatened. Haven't you ever heard of the ancient Roman coliseum? Did you know that christians live today in societies where they are persecuted, discriminated against, and often killed? Christians today are among the world's most violently persecuted groups in China, African nations, and elsewhere."
5,Must Read,"This book details the Muslim problems caused by a ""POLITICALLY CORRECT"" Washington that is afraid to stand up to a political faith and governing system that thretens to convert our society into an Islamic Republic. This message needs to be spread wide and clear. Unfortunately this administration and the traditional press are afraid to upset ""PEACE LOVING NON VIOLENT"" Muslims."
3,Do not read without your tinfoil hat,I wanted to like this book. Really I did. But man talk about really deep conspiracy stuff. Some of the things I agree with.Citations for this book is excellent! But I think he stepped on the wrong side of looney.
1,Terribly written propaganda with weak ties to truth,"I like to get a broad range of opinions, because I think it's hard to filter fact from propaganda in any type of weighted issue like this one. So I read the items from the far left, middle, and far right. But this book is terribly written propaganda garbage. It tries desperately to connect things that are most likely not related at all. Things like, ""the banker's cousin's wife knew the terrorist in middle school..."" and tried to imply that this ""banker"" was also a terrorist. (That was an example that i made up, but there were others like that that I don't remember b/c I read it two years ago and threw it in the trash).But if you are a far right loony bin, you'll love it!"
4,Pretty good....,"I enjoyed this book...I ""thought"" I had it figured out that ""R"" was not connected to a patient at all, but rather was some sort of lost-lost (or unknown) son of Dr. Stark. Well, that was certainly off track, but would have provided an interesting direction. However, as a psychologist myself, I was intrigued by the philosophical/existential implications which I would have liked to have seen further developed. Nevertheless, this is a pretty unique thriller!"
4,Fascinating premise,"I really like this book - it held my interest and piqued my imagination about how easily something like this could happen with unlimited financial resources and a diabolical motive. I just finished plowing through Oprah's last pick, Fall on Your Knees (which I did with gratitude when I had finished) - no comparison. Please, Oprah, take a look at Katzenbach."
2,"As somebody else said ""long-winded""","The book's story lacks of everything. It's not a thriller, it's boring and it has overly words and pages. In the other hand I have some queries:1) If the bad guy is so cunning and gave the chance to Ricky to ask only three questions which answers must be yes or no. Why he answers to Ricky's rhymes that were more than a yes or no answers?2) How could it be possible that a computer and shooter's layman (53 years hating computers and guns) became a hacker and a killer in 3 months?3)You think is that easy to live in the netherworld when you're not use to? He only had 53 years living a very good life.4) How could it be that one of the bests shrinks killed himself? It's not against psychiatry?5) How could it be that Ricky overcame his enemy if his enemy has more experience in swindling people?If you want to read an excellent thriller about family vengeance read ""The Caretaker"" by Thomas William Simpson."
4,Sneakily clever,"Katzenbach triumphs again, having read hart's war, the shadow man and the traveller, I was not dissappointed. With this story you root for the villain in the beginning and start rooting for the protagonist towards the middle and the end when he turns the table on Rumplestilskin in a shattering climax. The hero goes from clueless rich doctor to gritty operator who ends up shattering the confidence of his antagonists. Very hard to put down"
5,Fabulous,"Outrageous thriller. Read all night just to get to the end. Many twists and turns, it will keep you guessing. A true masterpiece!"
4,"A bit over-Analyzed, but still good","I read The Analyst hoping for something different and maybe refreshing in a suspense book. I found both, but felt it fell a bit short. The book introduces you to a widowed shrink in New York who receives a letter from someone whose life was apparently ruined by the doctor years ago. The doctor must figure out who the letter writer is or he'll be killed. I know this sounds ludicrous, and it is, but it's just within the fringes of plausibility. Or at least, you want to believe it is.It's a good story, and the weak main character actually shows some growth toward the end of the book. However, there is a lot of ""psycho-babble"" that gets a little old. For a book that analyzes everything, the ending felt rushed with little insight."
4,a good read,I thoroughly enjoyed The Analyst but I'm wondering why the book's cover shows a Washington DC Metro station when the story takes place in NYC and Cape Cod.
1,Contrived,"Sixty pages was enough. I admit it: that's all I read of this book. It was about 45 pages too many. I found the premise and the plot contrived. And far-fetched. A stretch. And, unbelievable. And the main character, a successful analyst who I would imagine has some semblance of thought, well... he was simply dumb! Or maybe just simple. (Did he REALLY need to go to the police station to find out what happened to his patient? And did the answer come to any of us as a surprise????)..."
5,THE ANALYST,"T rouble is visited upon psychoanalyst Ricky StarksH e receives a letter proposing a deadly game from someone he has angeredE very move has been plotted by the mystery man known as RumplestiltskinA s the game progresses, it becomes clear that Ricky is being manipulatedN othing can be taken for granted, nor is anything as it seems.A s the game goes on we watch Ricky adapt, both for better and worse.L ife-changing decisions must be planned and, more importantly, acted upon.Y ear's best book for me so far, nothing comes close.S ensational idea with a thought-provoking opening,T hrough to a very enjoyable game of cat and mouse."
1,not received yet,"i haven't received the book yet, when i do receive it i will tell you about it. mm mm mm"
4,Grest book for vacations,"Intriguing, almost a trap for the reader who can't un-hook !!!A very recommedable book for enthusiastic people with time."
1,Major Disappointment,This book was a major disappointment. The characters and plot are bizarre and boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone and did not even finish it.
1,Major disappointment,I found this book so boring I didn't even finish it. The story was too bizarre for me and the writing style dragged on too much. Cut 100 pages out and it would be more readable.
3,Stick with it and good times await,"I almost gave up on this book after less than 50 pages because the writing really is below average and I'm a major fusspot when it comes to that. But, but, but.....then the story totally reeled me in! The writing is still not excellent and you shouldn't expect more than reasonably fleshed-out cardboard figures but the story is truly a page-turner. I was almost late for work two days in a row because I just had to find out what happened next. The ending is a little bit of a let-down but I'd definitely still recommend it - the destination might not become a defining moment in your reading life but the journey there is definitely entertaining."
5,Chamois Shirt,"I live in these shirts all winter. I have a hard time finding ones that are long enough for me and these fit fine, feel really soft, and don't shrink. They are rather pricey but most are and these are well worth the price. I would recommend them to anyone who likes a heavy, soft shirt to LIVE in. I will give the same review to the Carhartt Shirt. I like them both and alternate them along with the Eddie Bauer Shirts I have but like these better."
3,Nice to have in the collection,"The print of the Railrodder on this DVD look like an older 16mm print and the print of the Silent Partner is pretty clear and sharp. If you don't own a copy of the Silent Partner with Keaton, it is worth the price of the DVD."
5,Ordered for my Godchild for Christmas...he's on your wish list so it was easy to find something he would like.,Arrived OK and it works great...he's on your wish list so it was easy to find something he would like.
1,Sad,"This show has nothing to do w/ Enlightenment, but lots of stupidity. It is a sad portrayal of slavery to american corprotocracy."
4,Quiet and Beautiful Desperation,"I randomly caught the first few minutes of this show when switching between channels and it immediately dawned on me to set up my DVR for the season. I'm so happy I did, with a virtually perfect performance by Laura Dern, it seems apparent why she was so passionate about the show being made she produced it herself. The portrayal of a central character who, to me anyway, sends the viewer in between moments of complete admiration and love for the character to moments of complete horror and complete discomfort. Casting a character who causes such varied states of emotion in a view is risky at best, as evidenced by the lackluster ratings of the show, but Dern's much deserved Golden Globe win may give this understated and ultimately beautiful show the second chance it deserves. I'll sure as hell be there for season two."
4,People take things too seriously,"I think this a beautiful doll. I myself am white, and a I can tell you that not all white people have the same skin tone. We range from fair skinned, to rather light porcelain type skin, to even darker biege type skin. No one race has the same color range, and that is a good thing. While I think we should show different ranges of skin color for ALL races, we can't get in an uproar when one particular doll isn't representing EVERY SINGLE THING! Take one thing at a time!"
1,I am NOT impressed with this Princess,"I am simply disappointed with this Barbie! She's downright unattractive. Her dark skin is lovely, but the makeup gives her features an ashen and dull look. Her hair is not cut well. It has a spiky effect that adds nothing to her look. To top it off, the fabric of her costume looks cheap, and the costume itself looks poorly made. Other Barbies Princess of Greece, Portugal and India are exqusite. When Mattel creates other Princesses from sub-Saharan African countries and empires they will do well to remember that black is indeed beautiful."
1,It doesn't look like the picture,The doll is ugly in reality. She doesn't look at all like she does in pictures online. The hair is all matted and the makeup is too dark. The clothing is cheap and cheesy looking.
4,An important work in the study of Biblical interpretation.,"The book Dispensationalism by Charles R. Ryrie is essentially an apologetic for dispensationalism. It is both an exposition and a defense of the dispensational system of Biblical interpretation. The book was written to correct some misconceptions about dispensationalism and to give a positive presentation of normative dispensational teaching. Ryrie's arguments are cogent, consistent and pertinent. The book is very readable and does not require extensive theological training to understand. I especially appreciated the considerate and loving spirit Ryrie had throughout his work. He defended his case and exposed weaknesses he saw in other viewpoints without a spirit of arrogance or divisiveness. All of my questions about and struggles with dispensationalism were not answered, but the book gave me a clear understanding of the position. It would be an important read for anyone investigating this subject."
4,Classic Work. But also...,"This was a great book for research. Also check out the newer book ""Classical Dispensationalism and its Eschatological Foundations.""There are not enough good books on this very interesting topic."
2,"grumpy, sneezy and sleepy","Although I share many of the authors views regarding the end of the age and the restoration of all things... I did not like this book at all. The tone is combative, dismissive and grumpy.I got bored and stopped reading."
3,Ryrie spends too much time looking over his shoulder,"This is a solid presentation of classic dispensationalism. The section on hermeneutics was well done. I noticed that Ryrie alternates between calling his critics ""non-dispensationalists"" and ""anti-dispensationalists"", and it would have helped to just stick with one expression. Not only that, the term ""antidispensationalist"" is a little too vitriolic for me. I also thought that there was a little too much emotional subjectivity, especially in Ryrie's addendum on the Sermon on the Mount and in other places where he rebutts the rebuttals of others."
5,Masterful Appraisal of Dispensational Theology,"The beloved Dr. Ryrie is a masterful Bible teacher, and his book on Dispensationalism is a masterpiece.It is written in academic fashion and is really a gold mine of sources and citations for the eager Bible student and researcher to form his library.Ryrie's defense of dispensational theology is tender, humble, yet sharp. It is an honest appraisal of the system, its foundational assumptions, and its ramifications."
4,"Clear, comprehensive, scholarly, passionate, accurate!","We are in desperate need of well-written treatments of dispensational teaching. Charles Ryrie provides such, to young and old believers alike. A must-read for any serious student of Scripture."
3,A resonable defense of the Dispensational Position,"Charles Ryrie's book is a defense of the Dispensational position. As a defense, it assumes the reader is already familiar with the criticisms leveled against Dispensationalism. The reader is stepping into an argument already in progress. Ryrie does define the Dispensational position but as a response, not as a clear, straightforward presentation. This is an update of an earlier version of this same book which might account for the organization of the material. The substance of Ryrie's work is a comprehensive and accurate representation of the Dispensational position (after all, he was a professor at Dallas Theological Seminary, the virtual epicenter of Dispensational Theology) but it is not the easiest book to follow out of the overall context of the Dispensational/Anti-dispensational debate."
5,The Best Defence of the Dispensational Approach,"As a traditional dispensationalist of the Ryrie persuasion I want to recommend this book for anyone interested in how to approach the Holy Scriptures. Ryrie does a masterful job in defending his position and critiquing the postion of progressive dispensationalists, covenant theologians and hyper dispensationalists. The best part of the book is his correction of assumed dispensational thought by non-dispensationalists. This book is a must read for dispensationalists and non-dispensationalists. Read this book in conjunction with ""There Really is a Difference"" by Renald E. Showers and ""Continuity and Discontinuity"" edited by John S. Feinberg."
5,"Dispenasationalism is a Help, not Heresy","Charles Ryie's book ""Dispensationalism"" is the best available. Prophecy does not make sense if God's program for Israel and the Church...past, present and future is not defined and explained. Ryrie makes the case for dispensationalism and opens the Bible up in a way that in clear and understandable.God's revelation is progressive...giving new revelation when previous truth is lost, man fails the test of his stewardship and humanity is judged.The sine que non of dispensationalsim is to keep Israel and the Church distinct in God's program, this distinction is born out of a literal interptation of the Bible, and it reflects on and understanding of the basic purpose of God in all His dealings with mankind as that of glorifying Himself through salvation and other purposes as well. This is helpful in opening the Bible up from Creation to Consumation."
4,God's Governing Phases,"Dispensationalism by Charles C. Ryrie is a very powerful and treasured study on the heated debate of dispensation. Mr. Ryrie, a highly acclaimed theologian, takes a bold and methodical approach in addressing this central debate. With his unique ability to unravel complicated biblical concepts, he presents all of the biblical teachings on dispensation in an uncomplicated manner. Written in a mostly non-technical, conversational style, his address toward the crucial issue of dispensation appeared thoroughly researched and easy to understand. This book is an excellent study for pastors and for those who want to know more on the subject of dispensation. It is also a tremendous help and source of material for the Sunday school teacher. It is also suitable for use as a textbook in Bible Colleges and Institutes. This book is a good read!"
4,Underappreciated and overlooked.,"This was one of 1988's most obscure and underexposed R&B titles. Of course, the absolutely gorgeous ballad ""Give Me A Chance"" is the album's centerpiece and its true moment of glory but the other songs are by no means bad or mediocre. The fact that this album came and went almost unnoticed can be blamed on both poor promotion and Urban radio's movers and shakers' unwillingness to give adult-oriented R&B more airplay. If you can find this CD at a reasonable price, I would recommend buying it."
4,Great price for a quality mount,"Purchased this mount for a 27"" Samsung LCD in the bedroom. Mount is very low profile, but has a nice (limited) tilt. Install was easy with the included kit, had screws, etc. for just about any mounting pattern. Great price when compared to local retailers. The Peerless website had this item with a MSRP of over $100."
4,Nice Cookbook,"I bought this cookbook for my daughter for Christmas and am now going to buy one for myself. Unfortunately, I am not an avid cook so I enjoy pictures. This cookbook has plenty of good recipes with great pictures!"
2,Midlife My Behind,"This compilation of stories is not as good as suggested. There are a few gems hidden within but for the most part, these tales mean far more to the authors than they did to this reader."
5,I was there,"I had the unique opportunity to visit Ocean Way studios on a mixing day for this CD. The sound coming off the board astonished me. I had recently become acquainted with Red Krosses new guitarist Eddie Kurdziel. He invited me to stop by. Now, I had heard early mix-downs, but nothing could have prepared me for the final product. These guys HAD IT!!! A hit record that showed not only the depth of there abilities as writers and players, but also that they had a group formula that jived (how many lineups the McDonald brothes had backing them up???? I think this is rhetorical). They backed up STP on tour for 2 years. Then, Phaseshifter faded into obscure oblivion. And that is just wrong, man.You must get this record.(Eddie Kurdziel RIP)"
4,The 1970s are back. . . again,"The 1970s are back. . . again, and dammit, we sure had fun back then, didn't we? Redd Kross's PHASESHIFTER is homage to those daze gone bye bye. Cross the Partridge Family with Kiss and the Beatles and you'll have Red Kross. . . kind of. ""Lady In The Front Row"" steals the lead from ""Ticket To Ride"" and then shifts to arena rock mode with a background harmony chorus that'll have you searching the room for Laurie and Mrs. Partridge, if not David Cassidy. ""Monolith"" is simple Beatlesesque and epic at the same time. Red Kross also rip off (with gleeful pleasure, I might add) some lines from an Air Supply song. Sickly, the whole package works wonderfully. Oh, happy days!"
5,VERY WELL ILLUSTRATED,"Wow!Sometimes you don't expect great illustrations, so when you get them, it's a tremendous bonus. This is one of those times.The text is good, and the illustrations feature cute kids and their shadows (naturally). We like to take night-time family walks, and this book is dynamite because it has led the kids to notice their shadows from all sorts of light sources. Sometimes, they can spot their own shadow three times from different light sources. This book is dynamite."
5,I love this book!,"I love this book! My parents read it to me when I was little, and now I'm studying abroad in Japan, buying tofu from the guy who walks around pushing a cart and making an almost ""pu pu"" sound!"
4,CRAZY U2!!!,"This is the craziest album by U2...There's many great songs like ZOOROPA, NUMB, LEMON and SOME DAYS, all in a tecno weird atmosphere...It's totally different from the old U2 of october and war..."
1,"Nothing like their early music, sounds terrible","Any artist has a problem with creativity. U2 reached a critical and commercial peak with their super album ""Joshua Tree"". Its been down hill from there, artisticly speaking. While ""Achtung Baby"" had its moments of greatness, this record has NO redeeming songs.U2 members (Bono) have talked about how ""relevant"" they are to the modern music scene. As far as I'm concerned, these days they are more interested in theory than in execution. These songs are poor, in fact they are bad. In 10 years, no one will remember this album.Over 10 years (from October to Jashua Tree) U2 was a best rock group around. They aren't any more."
1,Zooropa...,For die hard U2 Fans only. This disk is lyrically interesting but an extremely unpleasant listening experience. Give u2 credit for trying (and failing) with something new....
1,ZZZZzzzzzzzzzz.,"Judging from the other reviews that are represented here, many of those reviewers might be from the Official U2 Fanclub. How else to explain such favorable reviews? Right from the start this CD is a snoozer. The first track takes about 1 1/2 minutes to actually get started, (I didn't time it exactly). Usually a band will put something to get you into the mood of the album for the first track. Apparently the purpose of the album is to be a non-prescription sleep-aid. From here the CD doesn't get any better. I expect A LOT MORE from the band that released such classics as Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby. There was nothing on this release that is memorable, or worth shelling out more than a buck to experience. Listen to you friends copy, and I dare you to stay awake. U2 should be ashamed."
2,"Edge, Invite the Other Guys In !!","This is Edge's album (his pet project)...He drove the recording process and initiated much of what can be heard here. The album was pretty much recorded between tour dates and it shows. Bono said that Europa was a natural successor to Achtung Baby (well, Bono gets it wrong sometimes). Achtung Baby was classic U2. I can summarise this album in 3 words 'Numb', 'Lemon' and 'Stay'...after that it is a non-event.I agree with experimentation, but Edge - you just gotta let the other guys in (you are better as a four-piece). For U2 Fans only....By the way, the less said about the Johnny Cash collaboration, the better..."
3,Weird...but Good.,"This album is a bit of an acquired taste. It also helps if you're a big U2 fan. There is a lot of experimentation on this album, and the result is like a less catchy Achtung Baby. I like this album the more I listen to it, especially Zooropa, Lemon, Numb, and Johnny Cash's song, the Wanderer (this is an Awesome song, if you don't listen to it as a U2 song at first). This is a good album, but U2 definitely has better (try Boy, Achtung Baby, All That You Can't Leave Behind, first).Worth buying."
4,A Sonic Explosion of Decadent Excess,"Following the brilliance of ""Achtung Baby"" (an album far better than the overlauded ""Joshua Tree""), U2 solidified their dark sound and created songs which reached dizzying heights in musical experimentation and lyrical superficiality. ""Zooropa"" (the title track) is a long futurist medley of advertising slogans and unparalleled guitar genius. While ""Achtung Baby"" was propulsive and brooding, ""Zooropa"" is decadent excess. Comparisons of inseparable 2 CD sets are David Bowie's dystopian ""Diamond Dogs"" and excessive ""Aladdin Sane"", along with Bowie's ""Low"" and Iggy Pop's ""The Idiot."" Although ""Zooropa"" is uneven in its delivery (less schmaltzy love songs would have been nice), it is best enjoyed after the sonic assault of ""Achtung Baby."" No other album of the decade embodies the decadence and superficiality of the ""rock star"" lifestyle. U2 is best appreciated when they are insincere parodists of rock 'n' roll extravegance. Great ear candy."
4,BETTER THAN THE LAST THREE DUDS,"I'd take this over atyclb,htdaab,and nloth anyday,this is when u2 was about the art of music,not selling tickets..too bad those days are long gone."
2,Zooropa,"After a succesful change in direction and sound with Achtung Baby, U2 decided to try it again with Zooropa. What a mess. The former stellar guitar work disappears into the mix, the songwriting is dull, and then we come to the vocals. Bono seems to feel this sludge is inventive and original, but all the listener gets is a little boy playing with his new tape machine. I hope drugs were involved, at least then he'd have an excuse. For a singer with a voice that could cause goosebumps in the past, this exercise was a waste of talent and other people's money.It has become popular in some circles now to say this album is an inventive work whose merits are only recognized by the truly insightful. Don't believe it."
5,for the ages,"I listened to this album for the first time in about 10 years today. I hear it in a way that I never use to hear it. Before I perceived it as kind of a candy coated Achtung Baby redux, but I think there is something here. The sounds used are odd and innovative for U2. The lyrics--somedays are better than others, crashed car, dirty day, he turns his money into light to look for her, days run away like horses over the hill, numb, because when he hurts you you feel alive, wandering...bleak stuff, a real thread of alienation, looking for warmth and soul. I think Bono's lyrics on this are far ahead of the lyrics, for instance, on Joshua Tree, which is generally acknowledged as their masterpiece. I suspect that Zooropa might be the one that stands out for the ages."
1,A Numb Lemon Indeed,"Bono and the editors of Rolling Stone both seem to think this is a most ""inspiring"" effort. I was inspired to stay away after hearing ""Zooropa"", ""Numb"", and ""Lemon"". Zooropa sounds like trashola!"
1,pitiful excuse for an album,"From what I understand, U2 went into the studio to record this album not having written a single song and it shows. The album is utterly hollow and gimmicky with no artistic merit. I was hoping it was simply a brief diversion from their usual work, but Pop proved me wrong. Hopefully U2 will realize that they've hit rock bottom with these last two and take some time to write some quality music like we all know they can."
1,Where's the Zero star option?,"This, like all of their stuff after Achtung Baby is ***. The most disappointing album ever, followed by Pop. This isn't some rant against U2 b/c I like a lot of their stuff...but this album is terrible, throw your $$ in a fire instead."
1,Flung from my third-story window after two listenings,"Diehard fans may out of blind loyalty plead for others to accept this album as a natural evolution of the band's sound and a sign of maturation. I say, forget that. My appreciation of music is limited to that which sounds pleasing to my ear; I don't feel an inherent need to add money to a supergroup's coffers, just because they've decided to get experimental on me. U2 created catchy and beautiful music with Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. Zooropa is trash. Hence, in the winter of 1993, my roommate and I flung it from our apartment window...good riddance. Who cares if they wanted to make a statement about consumerism; make a statement yourself about consumerism by not buying this garbage."
1,Baby Bono Deserves A Good Public Spanking,"Zooropa, or How To Intellectualize Rock To Send It To The Grave. Unfortunately, it will get worse and worse during the rest of the decade. Come on, Bono, take your pants off!"
4,A good second-tier U2 album after it gets going.,"No, Zooropa is not on the same level as War, Joshua Tree, or Achtung Baby, but it doesn't fall flat on its face either. Underneath the layers of electronica and dance beats, it's clearly identifiable as U2 with smart lyrics exposing the dark side of modern life. Yes, often the songs seem a bit unfocused and could have been tightened up. And putting in Johnny Cash at the end? Well, after all, it is U2, and they do things like that because they can! So give it a listen, then another, and decide for yourself."
3,Achtung Baby II ?,"Don't get me wrong, Zooropa is a decent album from an excellent band. While it is certainly not a ""must-have,"" it is worth listening to if you are a fan of U2. During the 90's, U2 had a much different sound than throughout the rest of their career, so if you are a fan of pre-1990 U2 (such as The Joshua Tree) or All That You Can't Leave Behind, you might be suprised by this album (maybe a good suprise, possibly not). If you enjoyed U2's first major deviation (1991's Achtung Baby), you will enjoy this album, even though it seems to be missing a certain something that was present in Achtung Baby, one of U2's best releases. Zooropa shows a bit more of a lean into the electronic sounds than can be found on Achtung Baby, but it is not as bad as it is on Zooropa's 1997 follow-up, Pop. Overall, it is lyrically excellent and decent musically, although lacking at times. Fans of U2 should hear it at least once, casual fans could skip this one and opt for Achtung Baby."
5,U2 AT THEIR BEST,"This album is widely overlooked. With all of the hype about Achtung Baby and The Joshua Tree (which are great albums) we fail to recognize what is in my opinion U2's finest album. Zooropa puts the listener in a dream like state throughout the entire listening. All 10 songs take the listener on a journey. You will find no stadium sing-alongs on Zooropa but you will find your self. This album has had a powerful impact on my life. I can go on forever about Zooropa but would still not be able to completely get across my feelings about the album. The title track which opens the record is U2's greatest song of all time. Once you experience the song you are immediately interested in what the entire album can offer you and trust me, you will not be dissapointed."
5,Wild Over U2's Zooropa!,"After having listened to every U2 song ever recorded, I must say that ""Zooropa"" is one of the most underrated CDs for the band. The smooth lyrics and rhythm make this a truly enjoyable musical experience. ""Stay.."" and ""Lemon"" are my favorite tracks, but the entire CD rocks! Bono really demonstrates his poetic style and musical range in this product, which I will be listening to until I die."
2,Not my choice,"I am a big fan of the band, but this CD is in my opinion a low point. It is not terrible with songs like the title track and ""Dirty Day"" as my stand outs, but the rest of the album just doesn't stand out. U2 was moving toward more electronic music and away from some of the passion that makes this band great. I think that this is this CD's downfall. I was glad to see the follow up discs take a new direction. I admire the band's willingness to try new things, but this just didn't do it for me."
3,Not for beginners,"Zooropa is a solid album, but definately not for those who are just starting to get into U2. Highlights include: ""Babyface,"" ""Far Away, So Close,"" ""Daddy's Gonna Pay,"" and ""The Wanderer.""But dont take the album too seriously."
2,mediocre effort from an otherwise great band,"I'm the biggest U2 fan I know, but this far from the band's best album. Even the members themselves have said that. There are a few great tracks on Zooropa that are worth having on disc, but all in all I would say that the album as a whole is lacking."
2,"Some call it ""daring"" album....","....I would say ""disappointing"" is a better word. I would have to say this is the most disappointing of their entire collection."
2,IMAX soundtrack,"Aimless. Synthetic. All the tracks sound pretty much alike.Sounds like a pseudo-world-music IMAX soundtrack. Come back, U2! What happened after _Achtung Baby_??"
2,Too Clever For Their Own Good,"Most people think this is U2's worst album, that's because it is. This is the tidemark left by the wave of great music from their career in the 80s that finally broke on this desolate shore. Compared to the scaffold-climbing, flag-waving, rabble-rousing U2 of the 80s, here we have tired old men slouching down the corridors of studios, more worried what the critics will think than the fans. The lyrics are quite good but Johnny Cash sounds like the youngest guy on the record. No wonder U2 are now talking about going ""back to basics"" with All You Can't Leave Behind."
4,Ahead of its time?,"U2 leaped well ahead of their fan base with this experimental record that is a way out there vision of the world and society.Numb was a hit, and is perhaps the most bizarre and yet hypnotic U2 song ever. Lemon sounds like a lemon tastes. I can't explain it if you haven't heard it. Zooropa and Babyface also have that futuristic quality about them, with lots of Bono singing in a high-pitched tone.My favorite song on the album, actually, even though it doesn't really fit here, is The Wanderer, with Johnny Cash. I simply couldn't get enough of that track when I bought this.Basically, this is a good album with several intriguing songs and certainly is a must for fans tracking the evolution of the band. But it doesn't have the emotional gut resonance for me that some of U2's most inspiring work does.Enjoy!"
5,"So GOOD, but most do NOT understand...","This is actually U2's BEST album...it is a scathing commentary on Europe and the world...the musicality of it is top-notch, the experimentation meshed well together, and the topicality of it still rings true to this day as Europe continues to slide into oblivion (partying the night away as Islam gathers strength in the heart of Europe), even as they appear so wonderful and united on the surface...oh, and the WANDERER is the PERFECT song to cap this album, a condemnation...Mr. Cash (and by proxy, the people of the United States) hits the nail on the head with a SLEDGEHAMMER...this album sounds better today than it did when it came out 15 (fifteen!) years ago...most people then were not ready for ZOOROPA and many still are not...the title track, Numb, Lemon, Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car and the Wanderer are highlights...more than worth your dollar (or Euro!)"
3,Lemon,"First have to say that lemon is one of the best tracks I've ever heard from U2 and it is a shame it was only released as a single in Japan and Australia. It is the highlight of this album I think.The rest of the experimentalish tracks are either good or average I think but there's only ten unfortunatley. I often found, with songs such as Numb, that they soung good at first but then fade a bit on the third listening.I would rate this and Pop 7/10 but choosing between 3 or 4 stars, would give them three. They are both good experiments but are not much in comparison with some of their best albums."
4,STAY and listen to this...,"When this first came out, I used to watch that famous video music channel with the three letters...ya guessed it. When they used to play the video for the song ""Stay...(far away, so close), the song, and the vampire images of Bono, touched my soul. He makes a great believable caped night stalker too. For me, this one track IS the CD. ""Lemon"" is a good track, the title cut too, but ""Stay"" is such an incredibly sensual, deep, melodic love song. I can keep listening to it. The refrain is so lovely at the end it brings tears and touches the heart.The only U2 song that rivals this wonderful cut, is also a love song with a refrain that touches the heart with it's beauty called ""Walk On"" on U2s latest CD. On my review of ""All That You Can't Leave Behind,"" you can see more. If you don't own ""Zooropa,"" you should. ""Stay"" is a song any fan of U2 must possess!"
4,Most overlooked U2 album,"I agree with many others about this album being overlooked. ""Zooropa"", ""Stay"", and ""The First Time"" are true u2 gems, while ""Numb"", ""Lemon"" and ""Babyface"", are a nice change of pace. Although I would rather trade ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me"" for ""The Wanderer"", overall its a nice addition to a u2 collection, especially if you loved Actung Baby."
2,2nd one after a year,This is the second one I've had to buy in just over a year. I put it in a Jeep that I hardly ever drive and the gauge part of the unit went out just over the 1 year warranty period. The new unit looks like the fixed the problem of the sending unit grounding out accidentally. Hopefully this is the last one I have to get. The price was right and the shipping was fast.
4,Nice,I added tis to my CJ7 when a did a 350 turbo tranny conversion and added a tranny cooler. Gage works great and installation was very simple. Just cut into the new or existing tubing and install. I give it 4 stars because the backlight is not very bright.
3,Need to know electronics for this product.,"I was not aware of compatibility issues when I purchased this product and also had no idea what to do with the wires -- I needed a push-in connector to my stereo/radio. Very confusing for me. The ""stone"" would look great in a yard. Also mistook ""5.25""......""Economy Series Speakers""..... to mean they were 5.25"" in size and that there would be two. Instead, this giant boulder arrives. I'm probably to blame for this one. Good price -- probably would have worked well if I was more informed."
3,NOT AS BAD AS OTHER CRITICS MADE IT SOUND!!!!,"I started reading this book at about 4pm and I finished reading it at about 1am. If this book was as bad as what the other critics has said, then I would have never finished reading this book.I agree that it doesn't deserve to have five stars, but it was worth reading all the same. I liked the trials that Lord Barrisford goes through when dealing with the Melville brood. I thought that some of the things that happened were quite humorous, especially when the youngest burned his pheaton to a crisp. It's also nice to see that his character turns from someone that only gave a damn about his pleasures to a person that was able to finally see that there is life beyond the next pleasure.The only reason why it only got 3 stars is that it didn't have enough romance in it for me. I thought that maybe it would be more romantic than what it wound up to be. But atleast the ending was sweet."
1,Straight into the bin,"Yeech! I don't know why I bothered. I love regency fiction and Christmas stories are private little comfort reads. However this one was so drab, so dull and so ill-written with a silly plot, one dimensional characters and boring dialogue that I tossed it into the bin after the first 75 pages or so. The most attractive feature was the cover. My only excuse was that I was pigging out in my favourite UBS in California whilst on a recent visit and wasn't paying full attention when I added this to my pile of purchases. Sorry to be so negative but I cannot recommend this at all."
5,AS FAR AS THE CURSE IS FOUND,"THIS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM AMZAZON. THE BOOK ARRIVED ON TIME BEFORE CLASS AND IT WAS PROFOUND THEOLOGICAL WORK FROM WILLIAMS. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL CHRISTIAN, LAY PERSON, CLERGY OR ACEDAMIAN. PROFOUND BOOK ON THE SUBJECT OF BIBLICAL THEOLOGY."
5,Black Lace+,Excellent Book. This continuing saga just keeps getting better and better. I have no complaints with any books I've read by Beverly Jenkins. She is definitely one of the best authors out there.
1,Black Lace,"Unlike the other books that I have read by Beverly Jenkins, I found this book unrealistic and hard to read. I never got past the 5th Chapter before I stopped reading the book."
2,It's just okay!!,I love Beverly Jenkins but this book is definitely not her best... There was no excitement and hardly no romance compared to her other books...
2,Could have been better,"I am an avid Beverly Jenkins fan so when this book arrived on bookstores shelves, I rushed out and purchased it. Well, was I surprised when the story line, action nor sizzling hot romance lived up to her previous books. I found myself more concerned with the other characters (from her previous books) than with these characters. 2 THUMBS DOWN."
2,Not the Beverly Jenkins I know,"I love Ms. Jenkins style of writing, however this book was disappointing. Where is the romance, the sizzling love scenes, the great dialogue her characters are known for? We are spoiled fans and no one can write a romance like Beverly Jenkins. Please do more of the historical romances they were soooooooo good and take a break on the mystery stuff."
5,An excellent book!,"Loved this book! I hate to see the trilogy end because all three books, the Edge of Dawn, The Edge of Midnight and Black Lace were just superb. This is how romantic suspense is supposed to be written. I have no idea what those other reviewers were reading, but it couldn't have been this book. This was a funny, fast-paced, HOT read. Try it, you'll love it, too."
4,DESERVES BETTER THAN THREE STARS!,"There is not a Scorpions album out there that is only worth three stars, come on! While this album may be weaker than some others, it is still a great album for the ""beyond the prime"" era of the Scorpions. There is only one song on this album that is a let down and that's ""Lonely Nights"", just because we've heard Scorpions do this dime a dozen ballad before. If you like Scorpions, you will find this album just as musically entertaining as all of their other efforts. 4 stars, because Scorpions are one of the most legendary rock bands on the planet, and everything they put out is worth quite alot!"
3,Not Bad,"I am a diehard Scorpions fan but i was disappointed with Face the Heat. After the success of Crazy World, i was sure the Scorpions would create another Love At First Sting.This Album is by far not the best work of the Scorpions, but there is still alot of good songs on here such as ""Ship of Fools"" and ""No Pain No Gain"""
3,some great some average songs here.,"this is filled with a few great songs on it. The rest are more average for a scorpions release. ""alien nation' and 'no pain no gain' are great and some songs are more pedestrian. This one though is much stronger than the next one 'pure instinct' imo. Which is filled with far too many ballads. This one is solid enough to be enjoyable but can't compare to the greatness of the last 12 releases."
3,The Scorpions in decline,"For anyone who is a fan of late 70s early 80s Scorpions, this CD has to be a let down. The sound is there, but the songs aren't. I liked Alien Nation, Someone to Touch and Nightmare Avenue and even these don't match up to the best Scorpions songs. I didn't hear any real life in this CD. The playing was ok, but not spectacular and some of the lyrics were straight of a high school poetry class: ooh, these two words rhyme!This is not a terrible CD. It's still bludgeon your head loud and Klaus Meine's voice is strong, but it doesn't have the creativity or life of the old Scorpions."
2,REAL SCORPIONS IS GONE ...,"The real Scorpions finished when guitarrist Ulrich Roth left the band. After that, it came a period of well deserved commercial sucess with guitar player Matthias Jabs and the lousy drummer Hermann Rarebell on board, a phase which lasted until ""LOVE AT FIRST STING"". After that, the band lost their touch, simply that. In ""Face the Heat"" there are a few good moments, like ""Allien Nation"" and ""Hate to Be Nice"". Anyway, it's better for us that bands like Scorpions to keep on going than to listen to nowadays horrible new bands."
1,WHO LIKES THIS CD IS A FOOL,"Scorpions are the clowns of heavy metal. All the song except alien nations are VERY BAD, and i think that they wanted to give a glam image, but it worked so sadly.."
3,An OK scorps effort,"OK - Scorpions have been around forever, but it seems that heavy metal years equate to more than the likes of 'Rolling Stones' years! Give em a break!! There are some strong songs on this, although I must admit that it is not as good as 'Crazy World'. Forget the 80's Scorps - they are finding their way in the awfully confused 90's, where if you are not alterna-trash or thrash, you get lost. As a loyal fan since 'In Trance', I still give this a thumbs up to Klaus and the gang. Their piledriving sound still makes me feel good, and hey, what more does one need when it comes to poppin on a hard rock CD? Room for some new ideas (OH, bring back the HM creativity of Lovedrive, pleez) - yes. But not a CD to miss if you still like the icons that are SCORPIONS."
5,A great Scorpions album!,"This is a great album. Inside you will find my favourite Scorpions song ever - Daddy's girl (I rate it 10/5 as my favourite :)) (I don't know why it is not shown - in this packadge - but it should be inside - as it is in my Face The Heat album). Then you have Destin, Lonely Nights and Under The Same Sun - 3 great ballads - All 5/5 rated by me.But its not all - There are great hard rock songs like - Alian Nation (5/5), Ship Of Fools (5/5), Someone To Touch (5/5).The only 2 songs I dont like are: Unholy Alliance and Nightmare Avenue. The rest of the album are good rock songs which you will enjoy very much I guess and I rate em like (4.5-5/5)-Zaks"
3,"No pain,no gain...","The last good Scorpions album in the nineties,'Face the Heat'is a mixed bag of great heavy and melodic tunes we've come to expect from this legendary band and weaker tracks-especially in terms of corny lyrics-but compared to their most recent output this album really shines.After this work,the Scorpions have decided to drop their sting,it seems."
4,A Great Scorpions CD!,"If you like the 80's Scorpions, you should enjoy this. It's heavy, catchy, uplifting, and fun rock/metal - what the Scorpions are made of. I don't understand the negative criticisms of some of the reviews, it really delivers as a ""Scorpions album"" - honestly I'd give it 5 stars as such, I only gave it 4 stars because I prefer more epic metal like Iron Maiden."
3,Very interesting and unvarnished--better than I expected,"I got a kick out of reading the other reviews of this book, and agree with many of the comments from many of them--both the good and not so good."
4,Not bad,"I thought there would be more trash talk about the players, but its a good description of what a tennis player goes through on tour. Didn't really know much about Vince he's the quite type and always in the background of the top players like Roddick, Agassi but its an interesting read"
1,"""Da Vince"" Code Broken","Before reading Breakpoint I had no feelings at all towards Vince Spadea except perhaps empathy at his being tagged with the ""longest losing streak in a pro tennis players career"" label. After reading his book, I detest the man. He's a mediocre player that has a grudge to bear against almost every player who has beaten him on the Pro Tour. He tries to sound authoritative but he comes across sounding ""green"" with jealousy. His book will certainly not win fans but will negatively influence people."
4,Very enjoyable in its own way,"Is it well written? Are the tips on picking-up women useful? Are all of the topics mature?I am not sure I want to answer those questions because I loved reading the book. I read it in three days. It's interesting to learn about what life is like as a pro tennis player, what goes through his mind, and all of the excitement and the boredom of being on the pro tour.I rooted for Vince Spadea all the way through."
3,fun easy read,"interesting little book. kind of sort of diary on tour life by the player who held the record for most consecutive tour losses. so, right away, you know it's not a look who good i am - don't you wish you could be me reading. vince's humility is endearing and refreshing. unfortunately, it's not close to a behind the scenes look at the sport from an insider. can't recall one time what i read caused me to go, ""whoa. would never have guessed that. thanks vince for the inside dope."" i do remember thinking frequently, however, vince doesn't practice very long and hard. he repeatedly informs us of his ""grueling"" 90 minute court workouts. on a 1 - 10, a 5 1/2."
2,Pathetic drivel,"I'm sorry, but Vince Spadea should have kept his secret diary to himself. I did find some of his comments to be interesting, but for the most part the thoughts he expresses in this book are pure drivel and mind chatter. Unfortunately, Vince comes across as a very self-absorbed and superficial human being. Vince paints a picture of himeself as someone who is insecure and way too dependent on what others think about him. He wants the reader to think he is cool because of who he knows and associates with. Sad! I sincerely hope he doesn't represent the whole breed of professional tennis players in today's world. In the end I think Vince was just making another buck for himself with this pathetic account of his tennis touring life. One last thought, Spadea mentions he has only read one book in its entirety. Well this really shows! If he had read a few good books, I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted to publish such self-indulgent crap."
2,white men should not rap,"Especially tennis players.Has some interesting stories/dirt on other tour players, but for the most part this book ping pongs back and forth between ""I'm really a spoiled brat / No, I'm not / Well, maybe I am."" Spadea's intermittent ""rap"" paragraphs are enough to produce douche chills in even the most ardent Vanilla Ice fans.As for Vince's tips on how to pick up women.... I guess you can take the boy out of Gavone City, but you can't take the gavone out of the boy. Mamma lucia."
1,This one is a loser.,"I love to watch tennis on TV. I even went to a big tournament in St. Louis which lasted most of the night with John McEnroe finally declared the winner. I hoped to find this book a winner, with perhaps good gossip about the top men players. Instead it was a whiner: why can't I play better tennis and win more games; why can't I score with the girls (a predominant teaser every few pages); and why didn't Coach Patrick McEnroe pick me to play on the Davis Cup Team? I don't seem to get close to any of the players and just like to travel with my dad. No juicy gossip either. Don't waste your money on this book."
3,"Spadea's ""Break Point""","For the tennis enthusiast, the book is well worth reading. Spadea's comments on other tennis players are interesting and enlightening. Here is a guy who is not a star of the circuit, but one has to admire his willingness to keep plugging away. On the other hand, his tone is too whiny much of the time, and that is off-putting."
1,Does not help,"Spadea is not helping the game with this type ofliterature.Reflects his behavior on court. In a televised match,he hit a ball that had bounced twice. His opponent askedfor a ruling. The referee did not catch it and Spadeainsisted that the ball was up. My mates and I who watchedthat episode collectively felt the gentleman game of tennistook a major setback."
1,What a waste of 2 hours,"One of the most borring films I have yet to see. Just pointless!Poor script, poor acting and most all empty plot."
4,keepin' it real.,"I'm still, I'm still crying from this book. When I first picked it up, I used to like it a little, now I like it a lot. Don't be fooled by the typos that its got. It's still, it's still a book not easily forgot."
4,Real,"Just like the back of the book says, Why I Breathe... is an emotional ride. If you want to laugh, cry, or just enjoy a truely great story, this is the book for you. You may find a little of every character in you or someone else you may know, which makes the book that more appealing. Real People!"
2,Oh how the mighty sell out,"Ok. 96 degrees. Brilliant stuff. Then what? Disco sell out mess. If you like roots reggae DO NOT buy this CD. Buy 96 degrees and maybe some early stuff. If you like Abba's Dancing Queen a lot, then go ahead and purchase the collection. Make sure you own some Abba first.I imagine their agent or label suggested recording mainstream disco crossover songs with a Jamaican feel. Most of their songs are what you would expect from a band at a Montego Bay hotel. Sad as when you listen to songs on their great 96 album, you will hear some of the most unique and creative songs recorded in the genre."
4,Almost a perfect compilation.,"I enjoyed this CD enormously. But, some of the songs I love the best are not on the cd. Has anyone found Journey To Addis and The Story's Been Told? My collection would be complete. I have enjoyed this group for years. There's nothing quite like waking up to their music. Get's your blood pumpin'."
4,Loved it when I was a teen,I have looked for this book for three years. Nostalgia make me look for it again. I loved the story written by a master storyteller.
2,Not worth your money,"We got this for our son when he was 6 and it never worked very well. The tee always came apart and the bases are totally cheap! I wouldn't recommend spending your money on something so flimsy. The price wasn't expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for..."
2,Agree About Sterile Yoga,"I agree with S. Wilson about this video being somehow ""sterile"". I have many yoga videos, & had high hopes for this one, but found it disappointing compared to Lilias Folan's yoga videos. If you're new to yoga, her beginner's videos are easy to follow and very effective. If you want to practice with the aid of a chair, try ""Healing Yoga for Aches & Pains"", which I found incredibly good for relieving arthritis pain and stiffness. Just my 2 cents."
3,"Gentle yoga, poor filming and audio","Previewing the DVD, showed an excellent simple yoga program incorporating props, yet the film shots did not show a lot of body alignment. Also, the audio was poor, could not adjust the volume higher."
3,Easy Starter,"Especially good for beginner or seniors. Easy to follow, paced for gentle stretching. I would have liked a more instructive breakdown of the best way to approach the sun salutation."
2,very PBS,"I did not care for this DVD. I feel Peggy talks a little too much, its too informative and she speaks so slowly. It definately feels like a PBS program. I have bought several videos for yoga for inflexible people and this one I would not recommend."
1,Waste of Money!!!,I ordered this DVD and for the most part it is a waste of money. There are more introductions and interviews about yoga than excercise. Dont waste your money on this. I sent it back and lost 8.00 between refund and shipping. I should of just kept it and sold it myself.
1,Yoga for the Rest of Us With Peggy Cappy,"""Yoga for the Rest of Us with Peggy Cappy"" is a total waste of money. It has very little content and is mostly about the author. I would not recommend this item to anyone. In fact Amazon should consider pulling the item from its files."
3,Yoga for the Rest of Us,"I've used her video/dvd before and I bought this to help round out my collection of workout tapes. That said, this dvd is for the person who may have had a little exposure to yoga. I found the moves minimally challenging and good for those who need to take things slow."
4,Yoga for the Rest of Us worked for the Rest of Us,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Cappy's yoga session. It was fun and easy to follow. Her choice of participants helped us to feel that we too could perform yoga moves. It's a great way to relax and stretch the muscles. Definitely worth the purchase!
4,Yoga for the Inflexible,This dvd is marketed mainly to senior citizens with limited movement and is intended to get you moving again. It's a great way to start for those who are truly out of shape or experience pain and stiffness on a daily basis. The movements are simple and easy to follow and gets your circulation moving.
5,Delightful Yoga,"An excellent yoga source for those interested in flexibility, muscle/core strength and balance. I took yoga classes a few years ago and no longer have that option. I'd seen Peggy Cappy on PBS several times and am delighted to have her teaching me 'at home'. Physical improvement comes quickly with her instruction.Yoga for the Rest of Us with Peggy Cappy"
2,Not very user friendly.,"I was hoping this DVD was one I could work out with. Unfortunately, it's more of an instructional DVD than one you can work out along with. Didn't at all inspire me to do Yoga. As another reviewer said it should have been sectioned off allowing you to work out without the instructions. Once you've learned the routine the instructions are just annoying."
3,it's good but...,"I've had Peggy's 3 disc set for several years and finally decided to start doing it on a regular basis. I did not realize that one of the poses (bridge pose) was not good for someone who has neck issues. I found this out after my neck started to bother me (have to rest it now). I did some research and found that that this pose could put strain on the upper neck. I am disappointed that she does not say this on her video. If I had not done the research myself, I could have done further damage. Otherwise, I do enjoy the exercises, and she it is very relaxing. The exercises are not too difficult, but just remember to pace yourself."
2,Save your money,"I watched the PBS special and thought that looked too easy for me, so I tried Yoga for the Rest of Us. Well at 74 and stiff, this was still too easy and not enough yoga stretch.My school sessions on Yoga much better. I also had a Physical Therapy teacher that did an one hour Stretch and Fit tape before she quit the classes she was giving. She does from head to toe and and really makes each area feel good and stretched.This was boring. I cannot do some yoga, but I do like more Downward Dog, Warrior and Triangle poise, also chair pose. I will not get anymore of her tapes. I did not like the sound of her voice either. I do not know if she was trying to sound sexy or calming in the beginning."
3,"blah, no energy, workout was slower than needed","yoga is good for focus and concentration, but sometimes certain yoga teachers don't get their points across effectively...peggy does not have the""it"" factor that i consider a tv instructor need, she is just blah, not the best like these reviews said...she lacks positive energy, and this workout show be more defined as a senoir citizen wokrout, not one for obess or overly heavy people, they will struggle with it....not for me!"
5,Great for beginners,This is a great video for beginners because it is easy to follow and her explanations of the poses are very clear. It shows with and without modifications. The only prop she uses is a chair.
2,Needs less narration,"Once Peggy goes through the introduction of Yoga and the positions, etc, I wish the DVD would be sectionalized so you can proceed through a routine WITHOUT all the interview clips, participant's comments and Peggy's ""selling"" you on yoga. It takes the attention off of concentrating on your movements, breathing and body awareness. In other words, once you have been introduced to the positions and their benefits (which only needs to be viewed once), it would be nice to be able to go through the routine with Peggy's timing and calming voice guiding you through the movements. Please redo this and other DVD's so we may truly use your gift of teaching yoga to the fullest benefit. It is hard to recommend this DVD since I feel like a light switch is being turned off and on by the disruption of interviews."
2,sterile yoga,"Peggy does show how to modify yoga poses for anyone with physical challenges; however, it is presented in a sterile, uninviting format. She seems embarrassed to even smile and the participants work hard at looking straight ahead rather than looking relaxed or enjoying the yoga experience."
5,Completely wonderful for people with physical limitations and obese.,"I am an ex-college athlete. as such I have arthiritis problems, bad knees, and I am obese. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find an instructor that provides a gentle routine that gives you the ability to do some stretching, breathing and do some basic strengenthing of the body. Especially one that doesn't require you to be on the floor as my knees do not respond well to that. She gives both chair dependent and independent standing demostrations. This video is not for those who are in good health and average flexibility. For me it is life saver, I miss working out and I miss the effects it has on my body. Now I can do something gentle exercise without it causing my knees to swell or pain through out my body. Instead you get good energy and the ability to relax and meditate as you do your movements... Thanks Peggy!"
5,Excellent yoga DVD,"I love Peggy Cappy's yoga DVDs. Yoga for the Rest of us and More Yoga for the Rest of Us are both excellent for seniors, as well as beginners of any age. Peggy teaches calmly and carefully. She shows alternative movements for people who need accomodating. She does chair yoga, as well as standing poses. Her DVDs are the best."
4,Yoga For The Rest Of Us,So far this DVD is quite beneficial for the older and or injured community. Provides the ability to exercise without injury and stress to the joints.
5,"No strain, sure gain","This is indeed ""yoga for the rest of us."" No need to be a beginner with joints that bend like Mr. Bill's. The people in this yoga tape range from about 38 to 70 years old and for every pose there are options for those wishing more stretch, or less. Chairs can even be used. I reviewed every yoga tape in our public library, looking for one that gave us the benefits of a yoga workout without leaving us in knots. A great entry into yoga for almost any age group! My only suggestion, as these poses are very well demonstrated, is that someone totally new to yoga would find a visit to a yoga workshop helpful to get going. I give this an A for being a really great beginning for anyone needing to stretch and strengthen his body and balance. An A for being super for seniors, as well."
4,very good,"This book is very informative. The writing is clear and easy to understand!! Thank you, Miss Plum."
1,Not worth the effort to purchase or read,"We found this ""book"" to have the same information as is available for no cost on any standard web search. We were looking for more difinitive information as to the cause and relief of Shingles and found this book did not answer any questions beyond what we found on our web searches.I do not recommend this for purchase."
4,The Directory of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers 1961-1997,The item arrived in good condition and well within the required time period. I am completely satisfied with the purchase.
3,Princess of the Danish Court or Cinderella?,I found this particular princess looked similar to the Disney version of Cinderella. I do not know if that is either good or bad. I just think that Mattel could have been more creative and designed a doll that doesn't look like Cinderella. She is pretty and worth the money if you like the doll.
5,wonderful doll,i am very impressed with the high quality of this doll! her dress is dazzling and she is absolutely beautiful! this is a great doll for anyone starting a collection.
5,The four song on this cd are incredible.,"I purchased this cd when it first came out. I listened to it everyday. Someone stoled all my cds out of my car. Can you please inform me when you get more of this single in because I have tried everywhere to find it. The song electric morning is my favorite. This was my review for "" This is How My Drummer Drums"" BY DJ ICEY"
4,Fascinating History,"The legend of Silicon Valley has long lived in the lore of techies everywhere. However, we are into the 4th generation since William Shockley setup camp in Palo Alto--so there are many who may not have heard the tale.If you can answer the following:1. Why did William Shockley (late of Bell Labs in New Jersey) choose Palo Alto as the site of his semiconductor venture?2. What were the names of the traitorous eight?3. What is the genealogy of spin-off's from Shockley Semiconductor?4. Why did Bell Labs attorneys insist on omitting Shockley as a co-inventor on the original transistor patents?Then you probably don't need to read this book. Otherwise, you might find it interesting."
2,Nice try but needs more work,The transistor is essential to modern life in America. Without its development I would not have been able to leave this review today. This is a look at how it developed and how it led to the start of the modern computer. My one complaint about this book is that it becomes far too bogged down in scientific jargon and lost the social history as it did so. The business discussion is mediocre at best especially given the delicate relations that occurred to fight over this chip. A much needed book but executed poorly.
5,The Way Back,"Something is known. Something is unknown. Something can't be known. Osho follows the third. Never comment on any of his words which are contributed by some greatest wise men from east and west that had ever been present in this world. That'll be ridiculous. When I am in it, I am with peace and power. I was confused, I was at a loss, I forgot how long I had been longing and seeking for truth. Then, occasionally, finally, I found Osho. Like a lost child reunioned with the family, I reached out and walked into it. It shows a way, the way leads back to the homeland where I belonged to, WE all belonged to."
4,A Big Leap Forward,"Hot on the heels of their AFTER THE FALL CD, Ganymede returns with EUROMANTIQUE. This CD is a major improvement over its predecessor in terms of melodic development and production quality. It is chock full of truly infectious, old school synthpop with both traditional (80s) and contemporary rhythms. The title track and the vocoder-laden first single, ""Neon Rain,"" set the pace for the invigorating ride that follows. Patrick Runkle's vocals are reminiscent of the Pet Shop Boys' Neil Tennant's, although they are less deadpan and a tad less polished. Overall, this CD is an excellent representative of the work of the new generation of American synthpop bands. If this band continues to develop at the current rate, watch out!"
3,Very Devotional,I thought this was going to be more of an expositional book about singleness but it was more devotional than informational. Was very encouraging but didn't teach me much.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my K'nex obsessed son because they supposedly work with K'nex. I suppose they do, but they BREAK. In fact they break ALL the time! Evidently it's something the manufacturer is quite aware of because there's an illustration in the instruction book about how you can use them in their new forms when they break!My son decided to stick with his K'nex and I'm out an Uber lot of money."
5,for kids who like to build stuff,"Despite reviews that the structures were too complicated for kids, my [...] and 9 years olds have had no problem following the instructions to create the structures and they started with the most complicated structures first. However they do take a lot more patience than other construction toys and need adult input at some times.We have not had the breakage problem and the pieces seem pretty flexible - maybe there is a new formula for the plastic?This is a fun toy for the whole family!"
1,We just don't get it.,"My two boys, age 9 & 11, are avid builders of Lego, Keva Blocks, Playmobil and Rokenbok. They have had the set for 2 years and haven't built anything but a light sabre. I put it away, then bring it out at a later date hoping to spark their interest. They have great imaginations but just can't seem to engage with this set and I'm not sure why. It's just not very interesting to them."
3,Good For Hardcore Fans,"You must have an open mind for this one. That, and a taste for chaotic noise-metal. But there's definitely better music from these artists."
1,The worst disc ever,"This is the worst disc of Queen, an authentic crime against good taste. It's all the opposite to Queen. Don't buy it. 1 star because it's not possible to mark 0 stars."
3,"genius, if you are a genius","ok so if you like Queen, then you might not like this so much. These songs are hardly recognizable as Queen ballads, but thats what makes this scrumtrelescent. Das Oath's we are the chamions is absolutely hardcore while still being true to the emotion of the song. The blood brother's under pressure is arguably better than the original; i would argue that anyways. Gogogo Airheart does beautiful work with death on two legs. I give it three stars because some songs get a little vague (see Get Hustle's another one bites the dust-- very Get Hustlesque). But if you like to hear songs covered experimentally, then this is wonderful. to wrap up this sham review ill end by saying: Queen is boring. This makes their music interesting. yeah."
1,Utter Rubbish,Forget it. Simply forget it. I've heard better music when my tapes were playing on the reverse side and running at double speed. Utter rubbish.
3,beautiful patterns,"they are beautiful patterns, but not what i was looking for. Im not found of making bedspreads from thread [ tho there is no denying their beauty!] or even lace to sew on dresses, hang on shelf ends etc. I was thinking / hoping there would have been more doilies and baby items in this booklet. It's pretty good anyways, just not my favorite."
5,about the book,"Create airy and delicate lace designs for table, bed and wardrobe using the time honored technique of Irish Crochet. This handsome handicraft known for its raised floral motifs and intricate background patterns, probably originated in the convents of Ireland, where diligent nuns prepared beautiful ornaments for use in church services. Rita Weiss, a noted needlework designer and best selling author, has collected the finest, easily workable example f Irish crochet from rare American thread and hook charts."
2,"Good phone, but nothing special","3G CV (Cingular Video) is cool the first few times you try it. But unless you pay for more content (HBO), this feature would barely be used. Screen resolution is mediocre.Pros: Cost, form factor, 3GCons: User Interface, navigation - it's just slow, low res icons, and the buttons suck to me.I ended up using the SIM card in my Nokia E70 instead."
5,She Does It Again!,"Cheryl Richardson offers simple, heartfelt and very tough guidance for those seeking to find their most meaningful life experience. With lush examples and to-the-heart exercises, she helps the reader find their own way to their own best life. Unlike many other how-to's, this one also provides an approach to the wherefores and means to make your dream come true. Kudos to Cheryl for doing it again, providing the honest and forthright and kind way to find your own best way."
1,Marketing and Hype,"I am not sure who self-help books like this help more-readers or the author. After reading a few chapters, I just could not go any further. I am taking the author's advice and standing up for myself as a woman by not reading this book from cover to cover. I feel finding out what my life is all about will not found in pages of printed text of some self-help guru, but in living a full life with family and friends. Peace."
1,Not Worth It,"After reading some of this book I can honestly say that I am no better or worse off than before I read it. As a professional woman, I was offended by some of the nonsense in the book. No self-help here."
4,great!,"When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change. The most I ever did was 78 cents and one of them was a quarter."
5,A sensational follow-up,"A friend of mine gave me ""Take Time for Your Life,"" and I thought it was one of the best books I had ever read on finding and sustaining a real passion for life. When I heard about ""Stand Up for Your Life,"" I immediately got a copy, and it is as incredible as her first book. So many books like these tend to be simplistic, but Cheryl's works are much deeper and she offers many specific examples of what one needs to do to live a more meaningful and happier life. Cheryl is obviously extremely intelligent, but she also seems very compassionate. I cannot recommend this book more highly."
3,A Solid Effort!,"If you want to run your own life - and who doesn't? - Cheryl Richardson will tell you how. The first step in her program is getting a clear sense of who you are and what you want. Then, tap into your inner power to develop the courage and confidence to move ahead. Richardson's examples from her personal life and from her clients' stories add lively human interest, and her comprehensive step-by-step program might intrigue many readers, particularly those who have just started reading self-help literature. Otherwise, this is a repeat of a frequently taught lesson about how to decide what you want and take steps to get it. Her exercises can help you clarify your goals as well as find and destroy any emotional barriers standing in your way. We recommend this book to readers, particularly women, who haven't already been down this path and absorbed this message; you will find that Richardson is an encouraging cheerleader."
4,much-needed help!,"cheryl richardson has hit the nail on the head. as kids, we have so many hopes and dreams, and are so fearless... fearless to go after what we want, learn more about ourselves, speak our minds... as we get older, we are trained to do what others want us to -- society, our parents, friends, etc. and we start to lose sight of our ""me-ness"". cheryl's book will help you to work on finding yourself again, finding your own voice, and go after those things that you've let fall by the wayside. personally, after spending years in a corporate job, i'm exploring community theatre auditions in my area so i can get back into my lifetime love of musical theater... and i'm getting myself out of debt, and saving to buy a house someday, after spending the last 10 years deep in debt. she's great."
4,For women with self-esteem issues -- it's great!,"I bought the book as party of an online ladies' book group that was planning to work on self-improvement while reading the book. I saw that other women in the group truly felt that the book was beneficial. As soon as I read the opening pages, I knew that the book wasn't speaking to me. It's not that I have a huge ego or work to attract attention -- I'm just not particularly shy or afraid to try new things. If you are, I think you'll benefit from the book. I read the first two chapters, as requested by the group, then left the group."
4,This One's a Keeper!,"This book's appeal lies chiefly with Daniel's obsession with dinosaurs. He lives in his imagination, seeing dinosaurs everywhere he goes and in everything he does. It brought back memories to me of being a young child living in a fantasy world, and being so wrapped up in it that it seemed very real. My son, Jack, loves this book and we've checked it out at the library again and again. Now we want our own! This book is fun for kids to hear and for parents to read."
3,Gets the job done,"This is a great DVD player. It has everything you need, at a price you can't beat. It's such a good buy. It's easy to set up and easy to use. A great first DVD player for anyone who is thinking of getting a DVD player. I wouldn't use it on my HDTV home theater, but if you just want something simple that looks great, this is the one. It has good sound and picture for the price. Haven't had any problems with it, what can I say I love it. It was cool.Big Truck"
1,Lousy instructions,"I received my DVD last week, and I still cannot get it to work. I have tried setting it up on three different TV's, following the instructions given, and I get nothing. No picture, no menu, no setup, nothing. I have tried to contact JCV by phone and website, and I have gotten nowhere so far. I'm about ready to send it back and try another brand."
2,poor quality,I have a JVC TV and did alot of research before makng a purchase.I got this dvd player at a closeout price from sears. I have only had it 3 weeks but today it goes back. I have played a few dvd's and have found the picture quality to be fairly dark with a funny reddish cast to it. The sound quality is horrible. I do not want surround sound but I would like to hear the movie. I have to turn the volume on the tv almost as high as it will go which causes you to have to lower the volume when there are louder sceens. I hooked up the S-video output but it did not improve picture or sound quality. The remote is not that great and will not control your tv. The search continues.....
4,Decent DVD player,I like my new DVD player now that I have learned how to use it but anybody who does not have a RF modulator for an older TV may find they have a problem. Got the modulater and my DVD player is clear and audio is good --I have no complaint.
5,Replacement Book,"I bought this book 6 years ago from my book club. Evidently I must have loaned it out, because when I went to look for it on my shelves, it was gone.Knew I need to replace this book, Amazon had it! Yay!"
3,Long-winded is an Understatement!,"Okay, I admit it: I am a fan of Lincoln's. I was disposed to like this book. It's really not a BAD book, for it's very well researched, and Miller does know his subject well. However, his prose style is musty, circumlocutious, windy in the extreme, and almost deaf to any coherent narrative of Lincoln's life. The perspective on ""virtue""--a subject I find fascintating--is also strained to the maximum. In all due respect, this author has been speaking to star-struck undergrads for a bit too long. A good editor might have saved all this research; as it is, it's a longish, flawed book on a great subject."
5,Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography,"Lincoln's Virtues approaches this much - written - about figure from wholly new standpoint. As a biography uniquely revealing of its subject's heart and mind, it represents a major contribution to the current and perennial American discussion of national moral conduct, and of the relationship between politics and morality."
2,"After 2 years, battery is almost dead.","I bought this product two years ago in BestBuy. It has worked very well until recent days. When I use the phone longer than 15 minutes, it shows low battery and stops working. At the begining, I thought it's just battery's issue. But after few days, I noticed both handsets have the same issue.It would be a good product if you don't need to use it for a long time."
4,Pretty Nice Phone,"We have 4 of these, including the base set. The nicest feature is the intercom, where any phone can call any other like a cell phone when in the house. The biggest drawback is the quality of sound diminishes quickly when outside the house in the yard. Still, a pretty good phone for the money."
5,"21009GE3 Accessory Handset for GE 2.4GHZ Systems 21018, 21028, and 21098 (will not work independently )","Needed a couple more phones to go with what already had. Great price, works very well. We love them."
4,Good product,"I bought this phone extension to complete my 21098GE3 phone.The only thing that could be improved is the speaker, sometimes it makes some noises when turning it on.Besides that, the phone and its features are excellent!."
4,Just what I needed,This is a great phone system. Complete with speaker phone that works very well. Completely programable. In my case I couldn't find this handest in local stores and it is an addon to the original set that I have. I like them so much that I am contemplating adding another!
4,Quality Phones,"The phones have extremely good range and several features. The price is excellent when compared to the quality of the product. I'm very pleased. If I had one complaint, it would be that you must program the handsets seperately."
2,"Like the phone, hate the fading LCD Displays",I bought the GE telephone/ answering system 5 years ago which came with 2 handsets. After 1 1/2 years the LCD display started fading out. I bought a the addition handset from Amazon. Works great. 6 months later the second original one faded out. Bought a second one from Amazon. Now out of 4 handset only one LCD Display works.Time to buy another handset.
4,Adventurous,"The third album by Paralamas shows a little musical experimentation. Not as pop-oriented as the first two albums, Paralamas explores dub and some hard-edged guitar tunes. Very much worth having in your collection, but being a pop fan, I still like the first two records better. By the way, my copies are on vinyl, and I wish the first two records were available here...where are they?"
5,Selvagen,"Paralamas do Sucesso is one those great Band in Brazil, and Selvagen it the CD that put them in the charte as this great band.The music Alagados never get old."
1,Error-ridden,"This short, poorly edited text contributes little to understanding Dolley Madison's life or times. Not only is the text riddled with typos, but it presents an overly-simplistic and at times distorting view of Dolley. Zall continually refers to Dolley as a ""mother"" to those around her, attributing her actions to her gender rather than to her individual choices in unique circumstances. This book clearly aims at elementary school students, but it should be used with caution, as its focus on Dolley mothering both to her son Payne and to those around her distracts from her other activities."
1,what a disaster,"This little flash drive worked well out of the box. But by the end of the first week, the metal ring clip tore away from the rubber casing. No big deal, I suppose, but it was nice to be able to hang it from the key chain. The second week, neither my desktop nor my laptop recognized the device, and when I disconnected it from the latter, it had overheated and clearly no longer functional. I don't know if there's a relationship here, but after it failed on the desktop, so did my wireless network, which had to be reinstalled from scratch. So, all in all, $30 for two weeks worth of use . . . not exactly what I hoped for."
1,What is this?,This thing is a peice of junk... I just got it yesterday and every file that I try to save on it does not reopen ever again... and I get a different error every time... and there was no helpline number to call on the packaging. DO NOT BUY THIS FLASH DRIVE. Go with something else.
2,Flash Drive,"This ""Rugged"" flash drive is a great storage device. The only thing about it is that it is not rugged! I had it connected to the included carabiner and it fell off one day! Luckily someone noticed and gave it to me. The connecting device is connected to the flash drive by a small rubber loop. After one week that loop failed. If you want a ""rugged"" flash drive do not buy this one. Now I have it just floating in my backpack."
1,Defective junk,"The flash drive that I received is defective. I bought is as a gift for my father and carried it across half of the world before I opened the package. All PC in the house recognized it , but in attempt to read it I receive a warning that the disk is not formatted. When I try to format the disk, I get another warning that says that the disk cannot be formatted. Instructions from Tribeca tech support did not help. Bottom line - it's a piece of junk."
5,A Great Listen!,"I am not a big jazz fan, but my husband heard this cd and got me a copy. I listen to it all the time in my car. I became hooked on the sound and really like the beautiful,changing melodies. Later we took a business trip to Milwaukee and ended up at Summerfest. I heard a familiar sound coming from one of the stages... it was the Bonifas Quartet! I met all the members of the band and am trying to get them to San Francisco.I'm looking forward to the next recording!"
5,Excellent!,The characters almost step off the pages. I really enjoyed the book and can't wait till the next in the series.
3,Where's Belisaurus?,"OK, admittedly this is a fascinating series, but in this volume the storyline gets a bit silly. By all means buy this book, if you have read the others. However, in my opinion it is the weakest so far. Not enough Belisaurus, too much Antonia.I am sure all the threads will come together in the next installment but they are loose in this one and this volume has become a paean to political correctness.The next one needs more Belisaurus, more strategy and tactics regarding the final conquest of the Malwa and some more insight into the difficulties of moving a culture into the future by the insertion of weapons and tactics"
2,worst book in series,"The Belisarius series is often stunningly good. The first 4 volumes were fantastic. This, book 5, is the weak link. It drones on predictably. From the very title to the last page, there is not a bit of suspense. It is a book that could've been whittled down and included in the final volume, the Dance of Time. Book Six (The Dance of Time) is an improvement that manages to save the series, if not quite up to the standard of books 1-4. This volume just should not have been."
4,Quite good if you know what you're looking at,"I've seen some of the originals these images are taken from and they are quite well done. As the drawings are from art works they are not as detailed as some costume books so be carefull if using them as references for garment making. A great idea to have a wide range of weapons, clothing and armour in one book."
5,Bamboo rod stories are the best...,"Do you fish with a bamboo rod? Good, what you don't? Then you neeed to read this book about fantastic ""living"" bamboo rod makers. Ed does a good job of getting into the minds and work of bamboo rod makers and it doesn't hurt that he is good friends with Mike Clark. By the way Mike's rods are soooo expensive these days, if you could get one. I do understand that they are sweet though. Anyway, if you read this book and don't fish with a bamboo rod, you will be by the end of the book, whether through osmosis or the real thing.You can't pick up books like this and never read anything else like it. After you buy this book you better think about a new bookcase for all your other ""new"" bamboo rod books."
4,A wealth of information.,Great points from the masters. The other information is great as some of it never appears in other books. This is a must for first time rod builders. The information about Bern R. is very interesting as one of the new guru's of this master craftering of cane rods.
3,Good but could have been better,"Engle's book is an introduction to many of today's bamboo rod builders. The results of test casting each of the builders' rods seemed to run together as the descriptions of the actions were different but the meaning was the same. I am not sure I could pick a builder through these similar descriptions. The interviews about the builders' philosophies would serve one better. Overall, I thought the book was informative but with no color plates of the rods, the detailed descriptions lost much of their value. Still a good read."
5,Great CD!,"Having always loved jazz, and recently having been introduced to filk music, I really enjoy listening to this CD. Mary is great at conveying emotions through her music, from longing to be home in ""Two Hours Away"" to the mummy's ire in ""Some Believe"". A number of the songs relate to classic characters/archetypes from mythology, fantasy and fiction, with the song ""Legolas"" being a favorite among my female friends. I highly recommend this CD!"
5,Nintendo DS adapter,It is a great plug!! I gave it to my nephew because he has a Nintendo DS in Blue and I only have a Gameboy Advance. I thought the plug was for that that is why I bought it.
5,Can't beat amazons prices,My kids loose these so often. Rather than buy one at the store for $10+ dollars I order off here for around $.70. Great Buy
3,Kindle version for iPhone is incomplete,This book is very interesting. I am on chapter 2 as I write this and I have really enjoyed learning how our country formed. The only problem is that the formatting for the Kindle iPhone and iPad apps is really horrible. There are large gaps between pages and paragraphs end abruptly. The next paragraph starts and I can tell that the end of the paragraph is missing. Since I am reading this for a class - I'm concerned I'm missing out on important info and wanted to make sure this error was pointed out for others. Might be better to purchase the hard copy.
1,Where Am I?,"Well, I have read many books by L Ron Hubbard and this one left me stunned.Or rather, it left me wondering if I have ever understood anything at all about life or what it's composed of.I can only say to anyone who buys this book, be prepared to have all your preconceptions of life get thrown out the window. And, at the same time, realize that, if this is all true, then life is something far beyond what we have ever imagined.Since reading this book, I've found myself sitting and contemplating my existence, who I am, and what my purpose in life is more than I ever have before. I have to tell you it's an uncomfortable feeling at times.And I will say after having read the book, it might take some courage to read this and get through it. And some of the terminology is quite new or different, but is defined in the back of the book, so make sure you use that glossary or you might wind up giving up.Not for the faint of heart, my friends."
4,An interesting book inspired by Aleister Crowley.,"With pretense that would make P.T. Barnum blush, L. Ron Hubbard presents 22 famous names as sources of inspiration of this book. Its first few pages reveal only one debt of inspiration, to the late English Magician, self-proclaimed ""Beast 666,"" Aleister Crowley.In this text Hubbard denounces belief in God as a symptom of insanity, and presents Crowley's intriguing Cosmology as his own.Imitating - but poorly - Crowley's ""O.T.O."", he would, in a few years, initiate his own secret ""O.T. levels,"" and use '8-8008' to entice the unsuspecting into believing his empty promises of creating a race of World-ruling 'Supermen'."
1,Wierd science at its wierdest,"Very strange book!! Bills itself as an esoteric text on the philosophy of Scientology, but does not discuss the body thetans (spirits) that L. Ron Hubbard proposed were stuck to everyone's body in advanced secret levels. This book is an excellent example though of the type of sci-fi fiction turned into advanced religious philosophy that is a keynote of Scientology. The text is all but unreadable though."
5,A BOOK FOR CAUSATIVE PEOPLE. VICTIMS WON'T LIKE IT!,I have read this book three times and each time I amsurprised at how many more realizations I have becauseI understand it better. It is not a book for one wholooks at life blindly and is adamant they see.It is not for those who believe they know it allalready. It is for he who wants a fresh new look atlife in a grand way. What is our true spiritual natureand how can we operate in our lives from a causativeviewpoint. I love this book. I'm sure I will read itthree more times at least. I highly recommend it.
5,Recovering the Spiritual Nature of Man,This book by L. Ron Hubbard marks the first publication of HOW to address Man as a spiritual being and recover his abilities as a spiritual entity. Your abilities as a being are far greater than you have ever been allowed to believe. Reading this book will give you an an idea of just how far reaching these abilities can be
5,Our first Let's Read and Find Out book - but we will be buying more,"My 6 year old daughter and I read this book last night, and she was delighted with it. She immediately wanted to go outside and find the big dipper, but of course it was cloudy last night. The descriptions of the stars was simplistic for young children, but the book really didn't talk down to them. It actually named every star in the Big Dipper. I didn't know their names, and I doubt many people do. It also slightly touches on Ursa Major, the Little Dipper, & the North Star. One of the cool things in the book is that it shows the position of the Big Dipper in the sky for each season. Once again I learned something because it really didn't occur to me that it would be upside down in one season and right side up on another (I'm really not an astronomy person). I would recommend this little book to anyone wanting to foster a love of science in their small children."
5,new favorite,certainly one of my new favorites.. for me and my yoga classes!!! It really is quite the hour full of music.
4,"A Delightful, Cozy Tale","That Christmas Feeling is a lovely, hardcover book coupling two new novellas by award-winning novelist, Gail Gaymer Martin and best-selling author, Catherine Palmer. Ms. Palmer's story, ""Christmas in My Heart"", is a delightful romantic tale of Claire Ross and Police Chief Rob West. Add Claire's eccentric Aunt Flossie and dozens of cats into the mix, and the romance is off to a crazy start. Ms. Martin's story, ""Christmas Moon"", is equally as charming - in which kids' nanny Rose Danby tries to sort out her feelings for their widowed father, her boss, Paul Stewart. While she loves his twins like they were her own, she is certain her relationship with Paul has no future. As Christmas approaches, Rose's choice becomes clear. Both stories will leave you smiling and brighten the holidays. So get a copy, grab a mug of hot chocolate, curl up by the fire, and enjoy! A delightful read!"
4,That Christmas Feeling,"Catherine Palmer is one of my favorite authors. The story was well written, although not up to the standard of some of her other books. Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading it and have recommended it to friends."
1,"After 2 exchanges, I give up!","My 4 yr. old son received this camera as a gift, and boy was he excited (as were we all)! But what a disappointment. The film stopped advancing midway through the roll as we could tell we were tearing the sprocket holes. This happened again to the 2nd roll and then it just broke!. The button you press down just stopped working. The directions were useless and I even went through the expense of getting new batteries (although the camera mechanics seem manual). I tried contacting Chicco via the internet twice and the toll free number and never heard back. We exchanged the camera for a new one. Again we were all excited, especially my son. Sadly the film got ""stuck"" somewere between the pictures he took of Grandma in the airport and Dinosaur State Park. We couldn't advance the film or rewind it. We were SO dissappointed again! We really wanted this to work! It's so hard for me to give up on it, but I think I have to."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"My Mother-in-law bought two of these pieces of junk for grand children for Christmas, and neither camerad worked. The film did not advance correctly, the sprockets tore the film and the shutter release did not work on either of them. Both are completely useless, and the kids are heartbroken. AVOID THIS TOY..."
1,Heartbroken,"We also purchased this camera for our daughter last Christmas. She was excited, and has used it three times for her projects: trips to the zoo, etc. None of the pictures have come out. It is WAY too confusing for a 5 year old: the switches are all the same color, so she might open the back by accident. There's no way of knowing when the film is ended, and the camera keeps ""advancing"". An adult needs to rewind it. 3x now she is heartbroken. What a mistake."
1,What a let down!,"Our 3 1/2 year-old, budding photographer was thrilled to pieces when he opened his very own camera for Christmas last year. He took pictures every chance he could, and quickly went through the first roll. Sadly,we discovered that every picture he took was completely over-exposed. How disappointing! Of course, we tried again with 3 or 4 more rolls, then gave up. We would have been better off buying him a real camera! Don't waste your money!"
1,Lost Memories,"My son received this camera as a gift at a ""big brother"" party / shower so he could take pictures of his new baby brother. He took pictures at the hospital when our new addition arrived and then took it on school field trips. His teacher allowed him to use it on his birthday at school to capture some of his birthday memories. When we took the 3 rolls of film to be developed, not one picture came out. My son was devistated. He has since given it to his baby brother so he can ""push the bottons"". I overheard him telling his little brother ""not to put film in it though because it doesn't work!"" Now if a 5 year old can figure out it doesn't work, why didn't someone at the Chicco company wise up and do something about it?!?!"
1,Doesn't work,"Bummer, opened on Christmas Day and did'nt work from the start. Film doesn't advance. Too bad we didn't keep the receipt. Kids now use it as a 'pretend' camera, which is really what it is."
1,oh my god- we are not alone...,"seriously, i just got on google to search the camera's instructions. we can't get the film out!!!! well, no one really can either. ugh... how is it still for sale?????????? jeez... unbelievable. how about we ALL contact Chicco right now! everyone who has experienced this sad and stupid disappointment has the right to have Chicco hear it. and maybe they can be responsible and actually do something about it!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Fun Camera,"My three year old daughter loves this camera. It is durable and she can advance the film herself. All her friends liked it so much that we are giving five more away at Christmas time. We are often stopped and asked where we got this item. It also makes a nice ""Big Brother"" or ""Big Sister"" present -- they can take pictures of their new sibling.The picture quality is average quality and sometimes the flash does not go off when it should."
1,Broken hearted kids,"I bought this for my grandson's 3rd birthday. What a beatiful and fun camera. The only problem, it doesn't work at all. It doesn't advance the film and if you can get it to advance it certainly doesn't rewind to take the film out. What a heartbreak. It's got such a great outside design and is so child friendly. Chicco should work over the camera part and this would sell big. The Fisher Price child camera works well, it's just too hard for a young child to use and has no fun features. Too bad the outer camera of the chicco couldn't be combined with the inner camera of the fisher price. Any young entrepreneurs out there???This would be a great science project."
1,The worst Christmas gift,"We bought this camera for our 4 year old daughter last Christmas and were never able to get it to work. Her ""big"" gift request this year is again, a camera, and I'm searching for one that will work! We were never able to get the film moving through the camera and it was a huge disappointment. I had to put in 1 star for each category, but I would've put in zero if given the opportunity.I recommend buying anything but this camera!"
3,Chicco Smile Camera - not so easy!,"My 4 yr old son loves the camera. He can burn through a role of film in minutes. The smiley face on the front of the lens is very cute. My biggest issue with the camera is the manual rewind. It is so hard to rewind the film, I may just leave it empty once I get it out. I don't feel like struggling with it. Maybe it's just the camera I received? I'd return it, but threw out the packaging before I discovered this 'flaw'. The number counter is also hard to read. I have wasted a lot of pictures, or gone too far!"
1,No heat.........some vibration,"Does NOT have any heat. Received two units and both appear to be ""rejects"" - soiled, used, and ""banged up"". Little more than a weak vibrator. I am very disappointed......but to send them back would cost about the purchase price......so off they go to a charity,SAVE your money!"
5,Essential,"If you can get the Black Uhuru albums, do. This is a near perfect sampling of their work.This is real reggae, hard stuff. For people who only know Bob Marley this will be a real awakening. Black Uhuru were the absolute. Sly and Robbie are simply magicians.I'd recommend this to anyone who likes reggae. This band changed my life!"
1,Broken out of box!,"Received one of these as a gift and it was broken when we took it out of the box. Took a look at the other reviews and should have gotten a clue from what I saw, but decided to take a chance and order another. Bad idea...the second one was broken out of the box as well. I'm going to stick with the ball track pieces that don't have any plastic parts."
1,Another disappointed little child,"Ours came broken, too -- I don't know it it's the design or material, but I'm very surprised this toy was able to be manufactured and sold. HABA is normally a reliable brand. My son excitedly opened his end-of-the-school-year present, and...broken. What a disppointment."
2,Spiral track broken in box,"My son received this as a birthday gift and was so disappointed when we opened the box and found that one end of the spiral had broken off at the point where it connects to the block. I was the one unpacking the box and could see that it had happened either during packaging or transit. It's a plastic spiral and thin plastic at that. We'll be returning this item and buying a different ball track accessory since it's clear that this one is not durable. I'm sure he would have enjoyed the flexibility of the track, but it needs to be made of something better than thin plastic!"
5,A must for every teenage boy.,Book should be required reading in every highschool English class. Book explains that the way of life of a teenage boy has never changed even. Farrell was a genious in telling this story.
2,wahhhhh,"As the trilogy opens in 1916 Chicago, young Studs Lonigan is a horny lazy 15 year old anti-Semite racist punk. Over the course of this and the succeeding volumes, we watch him brawl, drink, smoke & carouse his way to an early grave. Yeah? Whooptyflip. It's supposed to be about how hard it is to be an American Irish Catholic; a point that might have had greater weight had not a young man of Stud's generation been rising towards the Presidency even as Farrell whined.Start with an author in the thrall of Dreiser and Anderson, add in the influence of both Proust and Joyce, and you have one of the least interesting, most technically annoying books on the list. (...)Grade: D"
4,New info,"I learned new ideas from this book. The gradual wearing away of a close marriage. He has ideas I had never heard of, and apparently they work for him and his counsselees."
2,Promises not delivered,"This book was a great dissapointment. His first work on men and depression was superb but this lacked the clearness and continuity of the subject matter. What started off as very intereisting led off into repetition, vague ideas without substance and generally nothing holding the book togeter. It isnot the kind of book you can read and use in our clinical practice. His stories of couples are too general and imposible to extract what theorical model he his trying to use."
2,Not convinced,"Mr. Real asserts as an established fact that traumatizing events in childhood cause us to adopt patriarchal male and female roles in our adult lives and in our relationships. Even if this were true - and for the record I wasn't convinced - he has precious little in his book that a lay reader can take away and use. I found his writing style to be pedantic and touchy-feely at the same time (not an easy thing to pull off), and sprinkled with long stretches of incomprehensible gibberish. Why use one little word when ten big ones will do? The guy just wouldn't get to the point.Professionals in this field may have a better appreciation for the style and content of this book, but I would not recommend it to those in need of counsel."
1,Another man-bashing book,"I came across this book yesterday at the public library, and even free, it's not worth the price.This book has some major hostility towards men. Terrence Real claims to have insight into the male psyche, and I grant that he has some. He does acknowledge men's actual feelings, but that's all. That's as far as it goes. As far as I could see, every single analysis he gives and every single solution he proposes is anti-male. I get the impression he thinks the way to save a marriage is to remove the husband's spine.His thesis, that there is some sort of ""psychological patriarchy"" operating in our society, is simply asinine. I mean, come on, that's just nonsensical.He seems to use the word ""Patriarchy"" on every page, and the main portion of the book's content are anecdotes aimed at painting men in a bad light. Basically, this is just another man-bashing book.I would recommend ""Why Men Are The Way They Are"" or ""Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say"" instead."
5,CLASSY LADY!,Nothing more to say then the best! Great compilation of songs from a lady who had it all!
3,I expected more,"I bought this CD for the rendition of ""Mary, Did you know?"". Prefer the male singer. This song is my all time favorite one."
5,44 Problems Most of Us Have Found,"This is one of those little books that anyone involved with fund raising needs to read about once a year. It'll only take about an hour to read, and I don't believe that anyone with any experience with fundraising can read it without getting at least one or two ideas to try.The book is written in the form of 44 little short essays I guess you'd call them. Each one starts with the statement of a common belief that all of us have heard before, often beginning with the words WE CANNOT....Then she spends a page or maybe three turning this around to WE CAN...It's clear that she has been in virtually every situation described here, that she has gotten around the presumed problem and gone on to a successful conclusion.This is not an overall guide to the fundamentals of fund raising, instead it's an avoid problems book. And all of us have had these kinds of problems in our non profits."
5,"UNIQUE, CREATIVE AND COLORFUL",The story is unique with imaginative characters and a very good message about getting along and working together. I am always looking for good books for my young friends and this is number one on the list for Christmas this year.
5,A must-read analysis of American Politics,"For anyone interested in American Politics and baffled by the current acrimonious political climate pervading US politics, Liars! Cheaters! Evildoers! is a must-read. The authors offer a comprehensive and accessible analysis of ""demonization"" in American politics and successfully show how democracy is the loser in this process. The book is both thought-provoking and refreshing and the chapter on America's moral paradox offers a fascinating insight that should be mandatory reading for foreign students interested in American politics. Finally, De Luca and Buell advocate for a return to more civility in political debate and offer a set of recommendations for change, including a call for Rights to Opportunity that put the real issues back on track and offer food for thought, whether one is a conservative or a liberal."
3,Baker reprint,"This book is certainly a worthwhile purchase but, because I already own the 1991 Baker copy, I thought a short comment might be useful for prospective buyers. I bought the 2012 Crossway edition because it was advertized as featuring a ""new, extensive introduction."" I was surprised to find an introduction less than 6 pages long. Again, I have no criticism whatsoever of this book but, if you already own the Baker edition, I just wanted to point out that buying this 2012 reprint will only get you 5 and a half new pages - the rest of the book is identical to what you already have."
2,didnt really work,"didnt really work i dont want to write 18 more words, this is why I normally dont review. This is ridiculous"
5,Just as you might expect.,"Good quality. Handy in labeling computer cords (printer, monitor, side drives). Recently when rehabbing our home, these worked well in tagging gas & water lines and shutoff valves. Could not find item in stores, only on Amazon."
5,Hollywood History of the World,"Loved the book and recommend to anyone who enjoys comparing history to movies. Since it ends early in the 80's, I hope someday Mr.Fraser or anyone brings the subject closer up-to-date. However, this book was highly recommended (my father - my best source ever) and deservedly so. Not to mention being very entertaining and funny as well."
2,POOR QUALITY,"Not a bad film,but its dubbed from an old tape and is bad quality even by Kung Fu standards.Theres a Chinese version available in Widescreen.Thats the one to get if you can find it.Yes Asia has it at the moment.called Lady Whirlwind"
5,Very original,"My only complaint is that the movie is in black & white. But very original and honest portrayal of illegal immigrants, gay issues & so forth. I live in Mexico and I was suprised how much on-target the character portrayals were."
2,declining quality,I have worn these briefs for probably 25 years (obviously I liked them) but there has been a dramatic decline in the quality of the product recently. I bought them from 2 suppliers and they were made in Costa Rica and El Salvador. At first I though the ones from Costa Rica were a little better as the fabric is slightly heavier but both have started to wear and fray at the waist band elastic. This is after about 3 wearings! Does not bode well for them lasting several years like the old ones.
5,Bali Briefs,I received my order in a timely manner. The Bali Briefs are so comfortable. You can hardly tell you have them on. If you don't put them in the dryer they will last a really long time.
1,hated them,I wore one pair once and gave them away because I didn't like the way they felt. The fabric felt rough and the leg bands too narrow.
1,misleading description,I did a search for cotton panties. The first word in the descriptive list is 'cotton.'These say they are 19% spandex and 81% Nylon. 19% + 81% = 100 PERCENT non cotton!It is difficult to find things on Amazon with such inaccurate descriptions.
5,Perfect fit,"I have been wearing this particular kind for several years now. Love them! The fit is perfect, stretch material and leaves no visible lines and no binding around legs. Very comfortable. Definitely recommend!"
5,Love Skimp Skimps,I've been wearing this underwear for about 15 years and nothing fits better and feels so comfortable. They last a very long time through many washings.
4,Great fit,These fit very nicely with no annoying side seams. I really like the cotton better for daily wear. These are very good with some outfits that cotton doesn't work well with.
3,Surprisingly uncomfortable,"Despite having the correct size and the fabric being very thin, the elastic banding on the waist and legs is very binding and doesn't give very much. It's lightweight and a smooth finish, but doesn't breathe very well and that mixed with the binding can cause soreness and rashing. For my needs, I won't be buying this again, even though I love how thin and lightweight the material feels."
1,Transparent,"I bought these in black. According to the reviews I read, they are very comfortable; however, I didn't anticipate that they would be so thin that one could see through them."
2,Very disappointing,"The first reviewer really does sum up this book. This the usual very thorough scholarly and very unenlightening look at Mary Magdalene...no new questions asked, no myths consulted, no real ideas entertained. Why did he bother? With the wealth of the gnostic codices now before us, Mr. Chilton still talks about demons in the Magdalene? He still talks about demons at all? He airily assumes that Mary is from the city of Magdala when quite a few of his fellow scholars question whether the town that exported salted fish was actually called Magdala at the time of Mary? He pays no attention to the ancient documentation that calls her a ""priest."" He assumes it was she who annointed Jesus with her hair? The book is tiresome. It could have been written fifty years ago. For all I know, it was. Bruce just dragged it out now to catch a little star dust."
3,An empty pan,"Publishers Weekly, or whoever it was, implies that another book about Mary Magdalene is hardly needed these days. Wrong. When a subject spurs so many to write about it, that means that subjects time has come. People are hungry for new revelation. So, if you're going to go to all the trouble to write a book about Mary Magdalene, then going beyond the accepted gospels seems a good idea. And if you're a scholar, it seems a vital idea. I can read anything (and I often do), so reading this wasn't too difficult. Actually, reading is like panning for gold. Sometimes you can stand in a cold stream for a week before you find a nugget. In this book, I think you could pan for a year and find nothing but pebbles. Still, there's a lot of obvious hardwork put into this book and being a fan of hard work and dedication, I cough up my three stars. But as for inspiration or understanding, well on those grounds, I'd give it none."
1,Rabbi Jesus?,"Throughout this entire book, the author referred to Jesus as Rabbi Jesus. I am a Christian woman, and Jesus is the son of God, not a Rabbi. I do not know if this author is Jewish, but this was totally unacceptable to me, which is probably why I did not care for the book..."
4,Enjoyed and Nice to Have,"My daughter enjoys working on this little book from time to time, she is nearly 5 years old and loves doing mazes. At this price the Dover Little Activity Books are an easy purchase and nice to have around."
4,About Nature Mazes,Nice mazes and interesting for the children. The size of the book should have been mentioned. It is a LITTLE book.
3,too easy,"bought it for my 4y/o daughter. She liked it, but finished the book within an hour.might be used as a starter maze book."
2,Not like the other Veggie Tales movies,"Our family typically likes Veggie Tales movies, but this one is our least favorite. Unlike ""Josh and the Big Wall"" or ""Dave and the Giant Pickle,"" LOTB has little if any Bible message. And unless you've watched ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, you won't understand the plot or the humor. Furthermore, the music and several of the scenes were a bit too scary and dark for my 3 year old. It seemed as though the makers of this movie just threw in a Bible verse in the last scene, when in fact the verse didn't apply to the movie much at all. I think Veggie Tales should go back to the old days when their movies were uniquely Biblical and humorous, instead of trying to make children's videos that are parodies of adult movies."
2,What were they thinking?,"As a consumate Veggie fan, I looked forward to this release ~ but was sorely dissapointed. Unless you have seen the recent verision of Lord of the Rings(and our small children who are VT's target audience should not have seen it)this story doesn't make too much sense and requires a lot of explaining. My first grader has watched it twice now, and still is confused about what's going on.Technically, this tops all previous Veggies. And Wynnona's music is great. But I felt like the producers wanted to spoof LOTR more than they wanted to get a valuable message across to kids. Much, much dissapointed."
5,Hilarious,Hilarious movie. Veggie Tales are great for kids and parents. It's as entertaining as Shrek but with a better plot/storyline. As an added bonus there is a dose of Bible thrown in!
3,A DIFFERENT VeggieTale,"My children, ages 2 and 5, love Veggie Tales, Larry Boy, and even the 3-2-1 Penguins series. This movie, was... different. It was a lot darker than all of the other Big Idea movies. My 2 year old didn't want to watch it, and my 5 year old ran out of the room when the ""Spork"" army came on the screen. I think this movie is better suited for older kids. It does teach that you have to use your gifts wisely - to help others - but that message is not conveyed to younger audiences."
2,Below Average Children's Entertainment,"My family use to love watching Veggie Tales. The original episodes were hilarious, filled with silly songs that would make the whole family giggle and laugh. But since Veggie Tales sale in 2003 to Classic Media, Veggie Tales have been bland and filled with songs that seem devised by someone with no musical ear at all. Lord of the Beans is no exception. It falls flat, and is reduced to just another below average episode of a once great franchise. Check out the earliest Veggie Tales, but pass on the episodes in the Classic Media era."
1,Veggies have sold out!,"I have been a huge Veggie Tales fan for seven years. I have always appreciated the Biblical message, and the creative way it was presented to my children. The Veggies don't do this anymore. No more Bible stories. How tragic that they have to resort to a pagan/grail story to present their message. The message isn't even Christian anymore. It teaches a message laced with Liberation Theology and salvation by works. We have to be vigilant in guarding our children against Gramscian (Third Way) Socialism. This kind of message has been crammed down our throats in the secular arena. That is OK. I expect that from the secular world. It is tragic that this ""paradigm shift"" has entered into our evangelical churches. The Lord said ""My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge"" Hosea 4:6."
5,Great movie!,"My son and I have watched the movie so many times, that we can even sing the songs. My little one loves it, so I do. It's great to find movies with a good message for our kids, and with a good use of the language, without ""bad words"". Kudos for the creators of Veggie Tales!"
4,A Down Under Perspective,"For whatever reason, Lord of the Beans (alone of all VeggieTales products)is not available in Australia. However, as both a VeggieTales fan (we have every DVD) and a Middle Earth fan (I've read the Silmarillion, twice) I can heartily recommend going to the effort of getting Lord of the Beans from Amazon. Lord of the Beans follows the usual Big Idea pattern ""Saturday morning's fun with Sunday morning's message"". It is both an entertaining spoof of the Lord of the Rings movies, with a theme reasonably close to Tolkien; using great power for selfish ends is ultimately destructive (in this case it induces sugar comas :-) while laying it down for others is rewarding. The music ranges from powerful themes evocative of Howard Shore's, through to zany 'Elvish Presley' numbers. And I still haven't been able to explain to my kids which Tolkien character the parasolled unicyclist is modelled on ..."
4,Better than some of their recent efforts,"You really need to be familiar with the 'Lord of the Rings' movies to see the parodies for what they are. The Billboy (Bilbo) speech at his birthday party cracked us up, but it wouldn't have if he wadn't seen the movie. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments. Overall, these just aren't quite the same, it seems they're trying to fit the message to the story when it used to be the other way around. Still, its better than most of the entertainment that's available, and this is worth watching. I'd rate it in my top 10:1.Lyle the Kindly Viking2.Little Joe3.King George4.Dave and the Giant Pickle5.Madame Blueberry6.Josh and the Big Wall7.Lord of the Beans8.Are You My Neighbor?9.Rack, Shack and Benny10.A Snoodle's Tale"
3,"who, exactly, is the audience?","It was fun. It was funny. But, as another reviewer pointed out, a 7 year old with no knowledge of LOTR wouldn't get most of the jokes. And then, Veggie Tales songs work best when they are funny. The ""Stuff Mart Rap,"" and ""I'm So Blue,"" (both from Madame Blueberry) for example, are very funny songs which still convey their messages.(I still clench my teeth at the very thought of that cornball Esther song--but then I was one who rejected Shirley Temple as ""too corny"" when I was six).Having said all that, the jokes were lively, the message of using your ""gifts"" wisely was good, and the characters within characters were well done. Maybe this is Veggie Tales for those on the older side of elementary school"
4,a good read,the book is written by an american woman with mideastern roots -- she provides great insight into the traditionals of the bedouin and arab worlds. I read this before I went to Egypt and it provided great foundation for understanding the culture of the town and village. I like her writing style -- she makes anthopological analysis interesting by explaining in the context of her interactions with the bedouins.
4,Met all expectations,"Met all expectations for the price, intended application range and ease of use.I would recommend it."
4,"K Hand Tool (SK 74104) 3/8"" Drive, Micrometer Torque Wrench w/Case","It works fine, does what i needed it for.Will check it's calibration"
5,Read It At Walmart,"It's good for baby's, toddlers, kids, teens, and parants! If you are a baby, toddler, kid, teen, or parent get it before they're all gone, sold out, or out of print!"
4,"Good, contribtory, but read SB 1 or God","I have to say this is a sincere effort to unify persons for peace sake and that should say enough. First, to cover the title of is religion really what you think it is, the author touches nothing new, but stimulates the biased mind in a hope to enlighten the reason for faith. I cannot say I agree with everything here, but it certanly is an effort to help many understand the pro's of faith. Second, the book takes a very realistic approach, well written, but is a bit lacking in character. I strongly recommend a book titled SB 1 or God which is much more convincing, by Karl Maddox."
2,Printing problem,"I have no quarrel with the content of the book because it was too difficult to read in the format from Digireads. The print, though small, might have been acceptable if it had not been crammed on pages with tiny margins and cramped spacing. In the future I'll be careful not to purchase books from this publisher."
4,Quite the Collection!,"Sonic was the rival of Mario back when Nintendo and Sega were competitors. Sonic was everything mario wasn't: fast, cocky, and had an attitude. the only similarity was that they both want to save the world.This collection of the original sonic games is great. I wish game companies would make more platform games instead of 3-D ones because of how much FUN these could be. Anyone can enjoy these games reguardless.The games are recreated faithfully right down to the pixel. It's a wonder of nostalga for those who lived it, and it's a world of exploration for ones who havn't.why 4 stars? No save feature. Why use the memory cartridge if you can't save?More like a DVD than a game, it has special features including concept art, movies, and previews.Fun for everyone, sonic will open a new generation to the wonders of 2-d platorms! Enjoy!"
5,Better than Megaman's collection!!!,"This is the coolest game ever! I don't care what other people say it'is awsome. Also to all you people out there who say your mad cause you can't save on games, just go to a cheat website and do level select to go back to the level your on. Comen sense!!!These are the games in it-Sonic 4/5Sonic 2 5/5Sonic 3 5/5Sonic and Knuckles 4/5Sonic Spinball 5/5Sonic 3D Blast 3/5Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine( a Tetris/Dr. Mario game)-2/5The unlockable games are Sonic and Knuckles 2 and 3Blue SphereFlickyRishtarBonus contents are the intro and ending to Sonic CD.Over a 100 Comic book coversCommercials for sonic advance 2 and Sonic adventure 2 BattleArtworkYou can also read all of the original game manualsOverall a good game and a must buy."
5,best sonic game(s)!,"this sonic game has 7 games in it. there are also unlockable games. the games are mostly the original sonic games like sonic 1, 2, 3, and all the old games for the nes. to unlock games you have to play each one like 20 times. if you like tetris there is a tetris game with eggman a.k.a. dr. robotnic. it's not one of those other sonic games where you switch people like in sonic 2 battle and sonic the hedgehog for the sega. some games (most of the games) do have an adventure mode if you pick the right game. this game is sweet but most games don't have 2 players."
4,Good Buy,"I like this game bc it has all the classic Sega Sonic games, which were great. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that you cannot exit one game and go back to the main menu to select a different one. Each time you finish playing a game and want to go back you have to reboot. Severely annoying. I guess that is good though if you are a purist, b/c the games actually run on an emulator so it is exactly the same game / graphics you will remember from the old days."
4,Fun and great for nostalgia.,"It's a great buy if you are in need of a retro kickback to your youth but don't want to waste so much money in buying the game seperatly and having to worry if the game would even work or not or your old system. It has a good amount of games, while some are filler its still a great way to spend your time."
1,Bad Game,This game is terrible. Sure it has 7 sonic games but in extras you can't walk around in a digatal world. If you want satisfaction get sonic jam for sega saturn
2,Bah,"More sonic re releases. I think we've played Sonic 1,2 and 3 if we wanted to by now. Same with Sonic an Knuckles and the rest of the junky games you get on this disk. It's not worth the money unless you see it for 2 dollars at a garage sale."
3,One glaring omission.....Sonic CD,"Out of all the games that are on this compilation game, Sonic CD, the best of the sonic games, is missing. This is the game that die hard sonic fans are waiting for to come out on a game system again. Sonic Mega Collection does have the first, second, and third Sonic which are great also, and you can still use all the old cheat codes at the start up menu. I just really wish that Sonic CD was one of the unlockables, but once I found out that it wasn't on here, I traded it in for a different game. Not saying that the others weren't great, just that I bought it only for Sonic CD. If you want a splash of nostalgia though, pick up the game and play to your heart's content."
5,Quality classics back to life,"This game consists of 7 sega classics, and 5 unlockable games. I have unlocked all the games, which is an unbeleivably long process, because you must access all the games about 50 times to do it. On the plus side, you don't have to be able to beat any of the games to do it. I would've spent the 40 bucks for sonic 1,2, and 3, but it also comes with sonic and knuckles, sonic spinball, and the mean bean machine, a dr. mario type puzzle game. Also 3D blast, almost forgot. You get to play as knuckles in the unlockable games, the blue sphere mini-game from sonic 3, and two lovable non-sonic titles, very hard by the way. I am 20, been around, and this is the best deal I've seen on one game ever. Besides, what's 40 bucks, if you wanted a used sega with these titles, you'd be payin around 100 by the end of it. I've never regretted buying it, and still haven't conquered everything. Plenty of gameplay, and good for all ages, definately a must have."
5,so much fun,"i bought this game to play on the wii and have had so much fun. this has all of the classic sonic games that we loved growing up and they are even more fun to play now. they were restored brilliantly and still look great. these games have tons of replay value and since there are so many games included, you never have to grow tired of playing any 1 game. loads of fun!"
3,sonic collection,"This Sonic game is pretty much a blast from the past, i love it in that respect. but unfortunately youre not able to save most of the games."
4,"Good games, collection could have been better.","I love all the games on this disc. It includes Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, and 3; Sonic and Knuckles; Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic Spinball, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (Plus some unlockable bonus games that I won't give away). The games, as I said, were good, but I think the collection disc could have been better. For example, they could have included a save feature for Sonic 1 and 2, and Sonic 3D Blast. But if you're looking for the old Sonic the Hedgehog games you remember from childhood and can't find them - here they are."
3,Ho-hum...,"Great guitar player (at least sounds like it to a non-guitar player like me) but a little repetitive for my tastes. Catchy is one thing, but the songs seem to all be constructed around one riff. Good background music but certainly not for ""applied listening."""
2,Ronny's Debut,"I have been a life-long fan of Hip-hop(but not nowdays, more christian), and this influences flows through this CD. Favourites cuts After hours, So what, and Summer smile. This CD was the beginning of my love for the Jazz Guitar. As far as I know, Ronny was one of the only few people to use hip-hop beats within his music. Why only two stars? Well the raps are very basic and spoil said tracks that they feature on. Besides I was never a big fan of Jazz Rap."
4,Nice & relaxing,"The antidote(after hours) is one of the most refreshing, laid back cuts that I have ever heard. I always cruise when I listen to this tune."
5,Magnificent,"This is what jazz can be.All the songs still sound fresh after almost 15 years.And what can I say about ""after hours""? This song is a staple of any good jazz radio station.That song alone is worth the price of the cd."
2,"Features A Great Spoof Of A ""DR. NO"" Scene","Though the film is typical of Bob's later 60's comedies there is a brilliant shot-for-shot spoof of the ""deadly spider"" scene from ""DR. NO"" (The film was produced by Salzman & Brocolli, the creators of the James Bond series)"
3,disapointed,was not at all pleased this was a DVD-R manufactured when you order it..guess i should of read the fine print better...quality was OK at best..SHAME on amazon for Sending out DVDR..i always thought that was illegal....
3,Not Too Happy At All.,"For what it is, I am very happy. That is, letter-boxed, and in stereo.However, it is not close captioned, there are no extras at all.What I am still incredibly unhappy about, and the main reason that I gave it, and ... only 3 stars, is because it was assigned to the U.S. Post Office. Therefore, it arrived one day later than I was led to believe that it would.Now, had it arrived on the day that it was supposed to have, then I would be giving this film 4 stars."
1,"Great start, then a crash","This subtly written, beautiful book loses its bearings on page 204. Up until then it is written in alternating points of view: Stephen and Kate each have a story to tell and a historical connection through Kate's dead husband.On page 204, the reader is suddenly given Justine's point of view (she is Stephen's much younger lover). Her thoughts are ordinary and banal. Then we are admitted to the view of Justine's father, Alec, for just a few pages. All this in the service of explaining a story that would be better left subtly unexplained.Why was the author so determined to explain everything? To make everything come out even, so to speak?The book is neatly tied up in the last fifty pages and the reader is left believing everyone will live happily ever after, at least for the near future. I just didn't buy it."
2,VERY SHALLOW BEWARE,"I expected these to be the size of traditional ice cube trays. They are not. they are barely 1/4"" deep. These are ice FLAKE trays. purely a novelty item not functional as ice cubes. Unless you plan on using the whole tray for each glass.I think they are cute and well made just too shallow to be functional."
5,Review for Craft Use,"I didn't buy this product for making ice cubes; I bought it for molding plastic resin for making jewelery/magnets/etc.As far as that goes, they work great! Once the resin has fully cured they pop out easily and nicely from these well-made silicone molds. I can only guess that they would work great for making ice cubes as well if they can handle the torture test of using liquid plastic in them."
3,Not as good as VHS version,"I feel that the picture and sound quality of this film is not as good as the VHS version, also produced by the National Center for Jewish Film at Brandeis University, which I so much enjoyed watching. The film seems to pause frequently. The sound seems to be a little distorted."
5,Don't Read Any Further,"Whilst you are reading this collection of ""reviews"" you could be listening to this truly amazing album!Take the hint..."
5,Hypnotizing,"Maybe I was an impressionable kid when I first listened to this album on my parents' mono turntable in 1974, or maybe it really is the most startling achievment in the history of ""popular music"" recording. Twenty-five years after I was first exposed (and more than thirty after it was recorded) I still lean toward the latter. Oddly, though, I don't listen to it as often as some others; it's not chock-full-of-hits like many of the ""middle period"" Beatles' classics, and as my primary listening venue these days is the car, I don't really have the time or the focus to get into the amazing flow of ""side 2."" Nonetheless, on the first beautiful spring day after a long Michigan winter, I absolutely must hear ""Here Comes The Sun."""
5,"So, I AM a Beatles fan","I read somewhere years ago (back when i didn't really pay attention to the Beatles) that everyone is a Beatles fan some just don't know it yet. In my naivety I had thought that it was a pretty bold statement, I didn't care how good the music was. After hearing Abbey Road once I was blown away. A tapestry of ideas, much moreso than Sgt. Peppers, It stands the test of time. From the light hearted ""Here Comes the Sun"" to the slightly sexy ""I Want You,She's So Heavy"" each track offers something different, and in 1969 it was deeper and more boss than anything out there."
5,From an Everly Brothers-soundalike pop group...,"...to this, the Fab Four's crowning achievement. The opening track, ""Come Together"" is worth half the price of the album itself--their only legitimate funk number. A killer bass hook from Sir Paul, worthy of Marcus Miller (who covers that number on his live album). Did you know that McCartney started out as a rhythm guitarist, but switched to replace the late Stu Sutcliffe? This track is a showcase of the bass player he turned out to be."
5,Once there was a way...,"Abbey Road, so aptly named after the road where the Fab Four recorded most of their music since 1962, is a fluidly sonic masterpiece, using all their experiences and knowledge gathered since their first release 'Love Me Do' to devastating effect.Each member contributes positively to the album, leaving us with a lasting memory of what made them the immortal Pop/Rock Band idiom.The first song 'Come Together', with one of the classic bass lines kicks off a strong 'singles' line up on Side 1. Other notable recordings include 'Something', 'Because' and 'Here Comes The Sun'.Side 2, with it's long medley sequence, evokes a thousand images in a little over 15 minutes of timeless recorded music.'Golden Slumbers' is a gorgeous lullaby-style passage at the heart of the medley.This album is essential listening, even if you're not a big Beatles fan. So what are you waiting for? :o)"
4,My Abbey Road copy is better than most but not flawless !,"The sound quality of this remaster is great ! Sad to say it does have a few pressing issues! Not sure if I will keep or send back to try and get a flawless copy of my favorite Beatles album. My copy sounds great except for song 5 on 1st side ""Octopus's Garden"" Has a scratching noise in 3 or 4 places. On side 2 song 3 "" You Never Give Me Your Money"" also has a fair amount of surface noise and scratching while the song plays but not as noticeable as on ""Octopus's Garden "" . I really wanted this one to be perfect. It sad that Rainbow Records let these leave the factory. They landed the Holy Grail of the vinyl record pressing business and dropped the ball. I hope they review the issues and fix them and I hope they at least step up and make things right with retailers and customers. I will probably try to get a perfect copy ! Hope I'm not searching for my own Holy Grail !!!! The music is awesome none the less."
4,Classic,"What can you say? Another Beatles album must have for your collection. I'm not all that certain that the remastering makes all of that much difference. The previous sounded good as is. Oh well, just my opinion."
2,Best Album But Poor Reproduction in CD,"This is probably the best album of the Beatles. I've had this album in vinyl. Unfortunately, the CD reproduction has lost the beauty of the sound of this album. I use audiophile grade stereo system and to no avail. I've also tried it in my Discman and my other mini components but still the poor sound. Other Beatles albums have been reproduced better in CD. It's a pity the record company does not plan to remaster it to make it sound better."
5,My personal favorite,"I was a college freshman in 1963 when the Beatles burst upon the scene in the United States. For the next 7 years, my friends and I waited with baited breath for each new album release. By 1970, the party was over for the Beatles, but their music lives on and has been embraced by each succeeding generation. What has always amazed me is how their music could be so diverse, innovative and flat-out wonderful and at the same time be so commercially successful. One does not usually associate high artistic quality with mass popularity.I will avoid the unproveable assertion that ""Abbey Road"" is the group's best album but will state unequivocably that it is my all-time favorite. The music is truly inspired, particularly the medley on the second side. I am truly grateful that the Beatles stayed together long enough to record this masterpiece."
5,"The Beatles,Abbey Road","I am very satisfied with your service and it is my intention to use it again.Thank you very much,best wishes,Marija Vidovi"
3,it's really good but not the best beatles album yet,"abbey road is best enjoyed accompanied by a glass of wine ,your girlfriend and a spare cd just in case the beatles are not your kind of band. personally i love the beatles and i rate this record as one of their finest.it contains all the ingredients that made the beatles the best band in the world.it incorporates some of their best known songs eg. let it be.it's lyrics are mind blowing something which has became part of their music. is it worth the money? the short answer is if your a fan buy it quick , if not you may be suprized at it's appeal"
2,"How do you ""enhance"" THE classic Beatles album?","""Abbey Road (Remastered) [Enhanced, Limited Edition, Original recording remastered]""This is almost unrecognizable with the original in sound reproduction. I thought I was listening to a modern cover band.If you could have only one Beatles album, the original Abbey Road would be THE one to have. How could you possibly ""enhance"" it?It's like painting a Cubist version of a Rembrandt."
4,To the reviewer who wrote The stones are no sell outs,"All though this is not The Beatles best album to say the Stones are not sell outs is bs. Praising ""Emotional rescue""? If the stones are not sell outs why do I here ""start me up"" in every commercial and why do they keep releasing ""product"" like ""voodoo lounge"" that sounds like they go through the motions. And how about those high priced ticket prices for ultra rich fans who never heard ""You got the silver"". No what your talking about before you submit a review or back up your claim."
3,Remastered Abbey Road is OVERRATED,"I bought the Abbey Road and Let It Be Remastered albums and compared them with the older' albums. In the car not really sure if I noticed a difference. Come Together actually sounded better before imo. The bass is too ridiculously loud now. I skimmed through the entire album. Who knows maybe I need to listen more closely??? With the earbuds, I only noticed subtle differences...mainly the remastered versions being louder. That's it. If you own their last 2-3 older albums on CD, don't bother buying the remastered versions."
3,Good but overatted.,"This album represented the beginning of the Beatles end. There are 3 excellent songs on this album. SOMETHING, COME TOGETHER AND HERE COMES THE SUN. The rest of the album is very average and substandard by Beatles standards. Nowhere as good as Revolver or SGT Pepper. I think this album is by far the most overatted of all the Beatles work."
2,Abbey Road 1969 - Adequate,"This album is OK, but kind of falls short. The Beatles proved they could rock both early (Hard Day's Night) and late (Back in the USSR) in their career. So, I've never really understood this band's attraction to silly, non-rock songs like Maxwell's Silver Hammer or Octopuses' Garden (or Yellow Submarine from Revolver for that matter). Additionally, this album has a lot of incompleted songs (Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, Bathroom Window, The End, Her Majesty) that have nice sounding phrases or hooks, but no verses around them. Also, what is the deal with I Want You? It has only one lyric.If you are expecting the dynamic combination of the Lennon/McCartney duo present in the earlier years, it seems to be missing. There are John's songs like Come Together and Paul's songs, like Oh Darling.Why give it 2 stars? I'll give you 2 words - George Harrison. Something and Here Comes the Sun save Abbey Road."
4,"good, magical mystery tour was better",I like this album because it has some of their weirder songs. I like this malbum but not as good as MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.
2,"Adequate, Saved by George.","George Harrison saves this otherwise mediocre effort of Lennon/McCartney by writing the two best songs on the album, Something and Here Comes the Sun. Without these we are left with the mediocre (Come Together, Oh Darling, I Want You), the silly (Octopuses Garden, Maxwell's Silver Hammer), and the incomplete but pasted together fare of Polythene Pam, Bathroom Window, Mr. Mustard.Interesting to note that George not only had the two best songs on Abbey Road, but the best song on the White Album (While My Guitar Gently Weeps), Revolver (Taxman), Rubber Soul (If I Needed Someone) and With The Beatles (Don't Bother Me).No surprise that George's first solo effort ""All Things Must Pass"" was so much better than Paul's ""McCartney"" or John's ""Plastic Ono Band"".As for Abbey Road, I've framed the cover, but no longer play the CD. Too dated."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all......","Got a chance to do a side by side with an earlier import version of the record. Remastered version is more open. Sound field stretches beyond the confines of the the speakers, instead of being suspended between. Sound is a bit peaky, as seems to b typical of most remasters these days. I'm not really sure why this is, but I leave that for bigger minds. Overall I give it a B+, compared to C for the import version.DJ"
4,for a group in disarray...George Martin gets the 5th star!,"The production is second to none. The performances, given thestate of the group, are excellent. So let's just enjoy the music.George Martin deserves the 5th star for bringing all this together. Remember, this was done 35 years ago."
1,This album is terrible,"There is not one good song on this album. ""Come Together"" is silly. ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" is childish. The songs that run together on side 2 are just pure drivel. ""i Want You"" might be the worst song I've ever heard. The two most listenible songs are by Harrison. That should tell you something. This album makes me vomit."
5,"""One sweet dream came true, today.""","The Beatles Abbey Road is my fave from The Beatles incredible, impressive work. I love this album so much. Paul is the genius behind this project. I never get sick of hearing The Medley, Carry That Weight is a clear standout and so is She Came in Through the Bathroom Window. Oh! Darling and You Never Give Me your Money are the best songs on the first side of the album. Of course John and George have amazing tracks as well, the beautiful Here Comes the Sun and Because. This was my mom's favorite album growing up as well. I am a recent fan of The Beatles and I tend to be one for the rest of my life. Get this groundbreaking album today! I also recommend Sgt. Pepper and Revolver."
2,death tells no lies,"hey this is the band with the dead guy right?What would you say if the title had been 'Everest' as some claim. That WOULD have been the next clue. It would mean: JPM ever rests (in peace), the with the funeral procession is most befitting.yes, get over it,paul died in 1966.Thanks. This CD stinks therefore.Randy Knitts"
3,Good but not their best:,"There are quite a few good songs on here like maxwells silver hammer and oh darling, but a lot of the album is filler. If they just threw in a few more classics comparable to their timeless compositions ""Ob li di, Ob li da"" and ""I am the Walrus,"" it would have been a more well-rounded and cohesive album. I know most people are totally nuts over the Beatles, but I think this was really only the beginning. It's on their solo albums where their talents really shine. I have most of them except the John and Yoko one where John's weiner is hanging out on the cover. I just can't bring myself to purchase that and keep it in my home. I may try to find a censored version, but full male frontal nudity has no place in my music collection. Sorry, Mr. Lennon"
2,You all must be......,"You all must be hearing a different version of this album. Because the one i have heard stinks. Songs such as ""Mean Mr Mustard"" and ""Because"" are some of the most cringe-worthy songs of the entire decade. I'm serious. Not only is this album not 'great', or 'important', it's actually bad. It's a chore for me to sit through this one.If it weren't a beatles album, it would, justifiably, be out-of-print and forgotten by now.It's ok to say what you _really_ think about this album, and these songs...This album is perhaps even more over-rated than Sgt Pepper. And, again, it's okay to say what you really think about that album, too. I wonder how you can look yourself in the mirror after saying that ""Getting Better"" is some of the most important music of the entire century.The Beatles that everyone loved was the Beatles of ""I want to hold your hand"" and ""She loves you"", not the Beatles of ""Mean Mr Mustard"". Right?"
1,"Horrible, extremely warped casette of Abbey Road.","Length:: 0:49 Mins30 seconds into here comes the sun, the cassete was clearly warped. NOT the quality i expected."
4,A star docked for not being remastered...,"Being one of the top-three best Beatle albums (I can never make my mind up...Rubber Soul? Revolver? Abbey Road?)this is a must-have for every rock-loving cd-buyer. It's the last outing of the greatest band of all time and the underlying emotions are showing (""Once there was a way to get back homeward..""). Things are never going to be the same and by the time the Her Majesty-ditty fades away I'm almost always dizzy by the melodies that passed by in the last 20 minutes.But now on a more critical note; this could be the best-sounding Beatles-album; it's recorded on 16 and (if I'm not mistaken) 32-track machines. Instead it sounds muffled, far too little detail(a track like Here Comes the Sun deserves tingling guitar strings and a booming McCartney bass, doesn't it?), far too little bass.Okay guys at EMI/Capitol/Apple; do what you did to the Beach Boys catalogue!"
5,The Best Album of all time!,"PLEASE READ THIS! Abbey Road is simply the greatest album by the greatest band of all time. There is no way to debate the fact that Abbey Road not only continued the Beatles' revolutionizing of rick but also wrapped up the amazing band's career. There is not one song on this CD that I skip while listening to it. If you want to start a Beatles collection....heck, if you want to start any CD collection, buy this. You will simply taken aback by the genious works of four British guys. The more known tracks such as ""Come Together"" and ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" are decent but unknown tracks like ""Because"", ""Mean Mr. Mustard"", and ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window"" are simply unbelievable. BUY THIS NOW!"
5,The Best from The Best,"...My Favorite 2 Tracks are:'Oh! Darling' - Pauls sings this quite well, and I like the emotion in the song. Paul was into recording 50's or earlier style songs and this is his best effort (see also 'Your Mother Should Know' and 'Honey Pie').'Here Comes the Sun' - Great guitar on this song, which was written by the ""Third Beatle"" George Harrison. Great Beatles song even though John didn't play on it. Check out George's 'All Things Must Pass...' if you like this one.The ""Rock Opera"" is great, though it was mostly Paul's creation. 'The End' was the symbolic end for The Beatles ('Let it Be' would be the last album released, while 'Abbey Road' was the last recorded, and 'I Me Mine' the last song recorded).I don't think I can say anything more about this album that hasn't been said. The numbers tell the story, even for all the critics who don't like the album (and probably still bought it!). Also check out ""Revolver"", my second favorite Beatles album."
4,not my favorite Beatles album..but still worth listening to!,"This will never, in my opinion, be as good of an album as ""Revolver"", ""Sgt. Peppers"" or ""Rubber Soul"". I have to agree with a lot of people...the best songs on this album are ""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun"" I also do enjoy ""Oh! Darling"" and ""I Want You"" because they have a good Rock & Roll feeling to them. ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" and ""Octopus Garden"" are kind of stupid, but still amusing enough to listen to. Definately the worst songs on this album are ""Because"" and ""Sun King"" -very drab and boring sounding! The last half of the album consists of short songs that all sound different, but seem to go together very well. If you were expecting an album of 17 full songs, you might be a little dissapointed at first, but once you listen through a few times, the ""medley"" will begin to make a bigger impression on you."
3,it was okay,"Abbey road was okay.Some of the songs were not good like Mean MR Mustard,etc.Come together,Something,etc really helped the album.It wasnt the best beatles album but you should have it.It was better than LET IT BE."
4,great album,"While it's definitely an album worth having, The Beatles White album is my favorite. Abbey Road requires a bit more depth on the part of the listener to fully appreciate the sound and meaning."
5,British Invade America.,"I bought this on vinyl for my mom and heard a few songs on there while she listened to it. Two songs that stood out to me on the record were both on side 1 which were Come Together and I Want You (Shes So Heavy). It has 6 songs on side 1 and 10 on side 2. Total playing time is around 47 mins, give or take. It came in a single jacket and the record its self was in a blank sleeve. The album is on black vinyl with a tan info label. On one side of the info label is a full apple and on the other side is half of an apple. So now on to what my mom had to say. ""In the 60s the british bands invaded america. I liked all of the bands but my two favorites were The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. At one time I owned every Beatle record but with record players becoming hard to find over the years, I eventualy got rid of all of my records and 45s. Now after all of these years found a record player and have now slowly been collecting them again."""
1,MUSIC IS DISAPPOINTING,"I LIKE THE BEATLES, BUT I'M NOT ONE WHO LIKES EVERYTHING THEY DID, JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE THE BEATLES. I THINK AT THIS POINT THEY WERE RIDING ON THEIR PAST REPUTATION.I ALWAYS LIKED THE ALBUM COVER ON ABBY RD, BUT WAS VERY SURPRISED AT THE LACK OF GOOD MATERIAL ON THE ALBUM WHEN I SAMPLED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT. I WOULD RATE THIS ALBUM A NOTCH BELOW THE WHITE ALBUM, WHICH HAD A FEW GOOD SONGS, BUT MOSTLY JUST WEIRD, NO CATCHY TUNES, AND HAS A DEPRESSED OR DOWN TRODDEN FEELING.I WOULD SAY TO STICK WITH EARLIER MATERIAL, OR GO TO A SITE LIKE YOUTUBE WHERE YOU CAN SAMPLE THE SONGS FIRST. THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE SONGS WORTH HAVING ON THIS ALBUM, IN WHICH CASE I'D SAY TO BUY A GREATEST HITS OR BUY SONGS INDIVIDUALLY. FOR SOME REASON AMAZON DOESN'T LET YOU BUY MP3'S BY THE BEATLES.NO OFFENSE TO BEATLES DIE HARD FANS THAT CONSUME EVERYTHING THEY DID, BUT QUITE HONESTLY FROM AN OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW, THEY WERE NO LONGER WALKING ON WATER AT THIS POINT IN THIER CAREER."
2,Overrated,"So reducing this to songs I can still listen to years later:1. Something2. I Want You (She's So Heavy)3 You Never Give Me Your Money4. She Came In Through The Bathroom Window5. Golden Slumbers6. The EndThe other stuff (HCTS by Harrison possible exception) just isn't great song writing, blind Beatle sheep. Stop spamming the world with talk of how great and legendary they are. Just when the old wave of Beatle sheep (former one right here) come to their senses a younger generation get turned on to them courtesy of hype and stick on for years till they too hopefully regain their senses. This only applies to a few of them, the majority are hooked on this sub-standard crap for life. More cash for Olivia, Dhani, Yoko, Paul and Ringo. You digusting, money grabbing, scam artists."
1,Beatles are pretty boring.,"I never could understand why the Beatles are so popular? They are pretty boring too just like Pink Floyd. Each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds. I just dont like it because it sucks! Dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below. The Beatles only made one good album and that's the one which contains Ballad Of John And Yoko, Hey Jude."
5,AWESOME,All my life I have been a 100% Beatles fan. I never in my entire life listened to any other band like them. John Lennon was my idol and Paul McCartney inspires me. I like to listen to this particular album over and over and never tire of it. It is the greatest ablum in the entire music industry.
4,s'aight,"I think people like the Beatles more because they're supposed to, than from an actual musical interest. Their enormous popularity, and catchy songs earn the Beatles their right to be liked by people. On the other hand, Dylan was a better songwriter, Hendrix was a better musician, and Joplin was a better performer. The Beatles are sort of a watered down stew of all these three rolled into one, which is alright. But in a world full of musical vomit, the Beatles are okay in my book."
2,dead tells no lies,"hey this is the band with the dead guy right?What would you say if the title had been 'Everest' as some claim. That WOULD have been the next clue. It would mean: JPM ever rests (in peace), the with the funeral procession is most befitting.yes, get over it,paul died in 1966.Thanks. This CD stinks therefore.Hugh Heckmann"
2,GH forget the rest,"Hello, spare me a dime.This is the ultimate Beatles CD!!!!Follow me please.Here comes the sunTaxmanNot GuiltyI want to tell youI me mineThink for yourselfFor you blueBlue Jay WayThe inner lightI need youI'm happy just to dance with youSomethingWithin you without youOLd brown shoeOnly a Northern songIt's all too muchWhile my guitar gently weepsLove to youTHat's all you ever need, ya dig?Peace bro!"
5,The Best Album Ever,"If you ever have to spend the rest of life on a desert island with one CD to listen to, this ought to be it!"
5,A Classic,"This is one of, if not the best Beatles album! It has everything you could ever want in an album...from heavy metal (""I Want You) to ballads (""Something"")...and just plain fun songs (""Octopuses Garden""). The way the second half is like on big song is great! What a way for the greatest band ever to make their exit!"
5,This Is a Really Cool CD,"I love just about everything by the Beatles, and this is one of my favourites (along with Revolver) There is nothing on it I don't like. I think the best song on it is ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" because it's fun and silly. I also like ""She Came in Through The Bathroom Window,"" a lot."
1,"what you actually get, not what the other reviews are about","What you get is not the 2009 Abbey Road remastered album, but a 1995 Capitol pressing the sounds like a used record. This Lp actually sounds like a badly used record (I have used LPs that sound better.) Do not pay attention to the reviews for this item because they mostly refer to the 2009 remastered CD."
5,I am a Beatles Fan From England,"This Album is proberly the best sence The White Album. They worked together to produce the Album to be rememberd to date .I really like how they put Mean Mr.Musterd,Polertheme pam and She came through the window together. How many Band's do you know today can even sing let alone write a song not as near as good as may be John Lennons worse songs that are proberly worth thousand's even through remember that I said the songs were never relesed ,any way I am 18 years old the very first time I even litened to a beatles song was about 1993 and the song was one of my all time fav's Let it be and While my Guitar Gently Weeps . Thank you for reading my review Marc Davis."
5,Are you gonna be in my dreams tonight?,"This is, absolutely, the best Beatles album, and for that matter, the best album ever. Sgt. Pepper is rather overrated, Revolver comes pretty close, and Rubber Soul is the closest to this. People put this album down because 'the songs are too short'. The songs are SUPPOSED to be short. The whole second side of the album has to be listened to as one complete expierience for it to work. If all of those 2nd side songs were 3-4 minutes long, that expierience would be 30 or 40 minutes long which I don't think was the point. Go and buy the album and listen to it straight through. Enough said."
3,Disappointing Remastering,"This review is for the record quality, not the content. The content is perfect in every way.I love The Beatles and I'm extremely disappointed in the remastering of these vinyl records. First of all, the covers are crap. But I can deal with the crap covers. Even when one of them came in bent. But the quality on my Abbey Road vinyl is probably better on a vintage version. There is surface noise the entire way through. I'm not quite sure why there would be popping and noise on a brand-new record. After paying $20 for a record I expect the best quality possible. I read that the main guy responsible for these newly remastered vinyls said that collectors HAD to listen to these. I beg to differ. Go for the vintage copies."
3,Perspective Says It Isn't Their Best,"Although this is often touted as being the best Beatle album, for those of us around at the time of its original release it was viewed as more of a reprieve from the more disappointing years of 1965-1968 than as their ""best ever"" recording.The Beatles produced some great and groundbreaking rock and roll from 1962 - 1965, then slipped into the orchestral backed, over produced pop dominated albums that were Rubber Soul, Revolver Sgt. Pepper etc. As the band returned to more rock oriented music with the White Album (although there was way too much on that) and Abbey Road, fans were glad to see them getting back to their roots.As for Abbey Road, ""Here Comes the Sun"" is a 10-star song, and carries the album, but it's offset by the goofy McCartney songs on side 1. Side 2 is OK. Overall, 3-stars."
4,Because the World is Round,"Listen to Because and tell me if there were ever three guys who sang better harmony. What a beautiful song.George shines on this album, contributing Something and Here Comes the Sun, probably his two best.Lennon was coasting/obsessing on Yoko. He has only one real song, Come Together, a rocker with a Walrus-like lyric. I Want You is a borderline experimental track from a suffering man.The medley is great but probably overrated in that they were unfinished songs. One thing that's overlooked with this album is that many of the songs -- the snippets at least -- were leftovers deemed unfinished or not good enough for the White Album. It's obvious that the Beatles' bag was nearly empty. It's like they picked up all the crumbs for a tapestry.Still, the album sounds great, very polished. Ringo is excellent throughout. Lots of Beatle harmonies.Bottom line: Great but not their best."
4,The Beatles album I could not be without is .....,"I own most of the Beatles albums. This is one of the better ones with probably the most consistent standard of high quality songs. You will not be disappointed.The one Beatles album I could not be without is The White Album. That is a masterpiece, with great songs including some of their less famous but most masterful work, and has something to please everybody. Revolver and Sgt Pepper are the next best followed closely by Abbey Road.Something, Come Together and Here comes the sun are the best songs on this album. My favorites are Maxwell and You never give me your money, and Bathroom window."
4,Sad commentary on the individual genius of The Beatles,"If Sgt Pepper's is the cover of eight Beatles, then Abbey Road is the five Beatle cover. The Volkswagen Beetle on the sleeve photo allegedly held one of the clues to the supposed death of Paul McCartney, a rumour spread by a Chicago college radio station. In actuality, The Beatles were dead. Although Let it Be was released after Abbey Road, the latter was the album on which the members last performed together. And the music remains a witness to how the different band members were going their own individual ways. But the medley which ends Abbey Road remains the swansong of The Beatles. Ironically they comprise old half-written Beatles songs. For those who have not heard it, this is highly recommended if only for it."
5,20th Century Masterpiece,"This is an album I have been listening to my whole life, basically. Occasionally I see it there in my itunes list and fire it up again. Every time I do, I am re-amazed at how good it is. A 20th century masterpiece."
4,beatles best,"i wanted to give this 5 stars but octopus`s garden and maxwells silver hammer are the only negative tracks.""something"" is incredible (john lennon at his best).but i have to take my hat off to paul macartney for what is on side b.""golden slumbers"" and ""carry that weight"" are class...""mean mr mustard and polythene pam"" are brilliant,but ""you never give me your money"" is in my opinion the best beatle track.it was the first time i had heard a song go in so many different directions but just come together so well."
3,"Abbey Road 2012 vinyl 180g Update Review,12/31/12","I have the original Abbey Road vinyl from 1969 in almost mint shape. Bought it new. Got my 2012 new Abbey Road today. I don't think the sound is that much better than my original album. I can hear a few pops and noise on some tracks, not bad but this is a new record. This copy is the 180g vinyl. I have other new vinyl that doesn't make a sound. I have bought three records, Let It Be, The Beatles, and Abbey Road and they all have some problem with noise, pops ect on each LP. Look close at the record and you can see the marks on the vinyl. Plus dirt or dust on them and ruff edges. It is not Amazons fault they didn't make the records. I won't buy any more, I want a new clean sounding record. Hope EMI and Capital fix these problems."
2,Didn't Quite Make It,"There are a few good songs on this album, which I bought upon its release in 1969, including Here Comes the Sun.On the second side was an attempt at a long run of songs that flow one to the next to the next, but it really doesn't work that well. This is because the songs aren't really songs, but short samples of unfinished works that can't stand on their own.Pink Floyd got this concept right with Dark Side of the Moon, with full length songs.Overall OK."
3,Only the Beatles...,"Could get away with this album being considered a classic, even masterpiece in some peoples eyes. Once again the artistic praise afforded to this group is overdone. This album contains 3 fine songs COME TOGETHER, SOMETHING & HERE COMES THE SUN. The rest is bland filler, by a group well past its prime, and no longer functioning as a proper group."
2,I don't get it,"Although, many fans consider the legendary Beatles' final album their best, try as I may, I just can not see Abbey Road as anything great. ""Oh! Darling,"" ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" and ""Octopus' Garden"" are just silly, the song suite on the second side is well constructed but utterly confused and jumbled and ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" becomes very tedious. Only ""Come Together,"" ""Something,"" ""Here Comes the Sun"" and the cool cover image reflect the band's past greatness. You may enjoy it. Many do. But I would recommend Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, the white album and even lesser acclaimed Beatles albums such as Magical Mystery Tour and Let It Be before the weak silliness of Abbey Road."
5,Are you kidding me?,"""The greatest album of all time"" is a matter of taste but anyone that does not have this on the top 10 list is an idiot. The (very few) people who gave this less than 5 stars must be tone deaf morons!"
4,"BIG, BAD, BABBLIN' BOB SPEAKS","Though this album was released before the Beatles swan song ""Let It Be"", it was accually recorded after the Let It Be sessions, and is accually the Beatles last album. Who cares you ask? Well, you better, you moron! How'd ya like it if I jumped outta your fancy computer monitor and punched ya in your fool head!Sorry....ol' Bobs med ran out the other day....GET THESE SPIDERS OUTTA MY HEAD...NUMBER NINE,NUMBER NINE,NUMBER NINE......buck buck buck, I'm a CHICKEN,I'M A CHICKEN. Sorry. Anyho, Buy Abbey Road. It's a classic. Some say it's better than Sqt. Pepper. Me and the rest of us chickens disagree but it's a must have."
5,Finest Swan Song Ever,"They never said to each other that this was going to be their last album, but in their hearts they knew it... and it shows.This is truly a classic album to have in your collection whether you're a Beatles fan or not. Moving away from their psychedelic roots, they recorded an album that was heavy, gentle, sweeping, and fitting.Many people will know it for songs like ""Something"" or ""Come Together"" which stand as monumental singles. However, people tend to forget the two sweeping medleys that take up the second half of the album. Unlike things they had done previously, The Beatles once again took their artform to another level by placing multiple song medleys to end off their career.Also, don't forget the heavy rock displayed by Lennon's ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)."" Add the playful songs such as ""Octopus' Garden"" and ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" and you have a complete Beatles' album fitting enough to finish their career and dazzling enough to influence new ones."
2,Beatles and Abbey Road,"The Beatles are famous not for making great music, but for being popular (there IS a difference). They may have made some great songs, even on this album (Here Comes the Sun and Come Together) but their filler was less than bearable. Rock and roll was all about the evolution of blues to a faster beat. I hear little blues in the Beatles' songs, in fact most of it (especially Sgt. Pepper's) was experimental and a type of music that never caught on. If one wants some good rock and roll, try the Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix, who made the best blues rock and roll ever. Abbey Road has some timeless classics, and it is an injustice to say that the Beatles were not a good band, but they were popular, which in some people's minds made them great, which they were not."
2,Could Have Been SO Much Better,"Given that ""Let It Be"" had not been released by the time ""Abbey Road"" was recorded, it's unfortunate that the unfinished songs on side two of Abbey Road as well as the stupid Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octopuses Garden weren't replaced by some of the better songs on Let It Be. As a result, the Beatles finished with yet another sub-par album in typical post-1965 fashion; a few good songs, with lots of silliness and filler interspersed among them."
2,Medicore at best,This is the beatles most overrated album. I never understood why it's often praised so often. I mean sone songs on Side 1 are meaningless and silly. The second side definitly saved this album from total catostrophy..I dont recommend this album...listen to it before you buy and judge yourself.
2,Abbey Road -1969,"""Not only are the songs excellent, but also the mood of the album is hypnotic."" Oh, please. Side one of Abbey Road doesn't flow at all, especially with the goofy Maxwell and Octopuses Garden. Hypnotic is Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon. This doesn't come close.Here Comes the Sun very good, but can't save the album. 2-stars."
2,BEATLES WORST ALBUM,"That being said, this is still better than most other albums. But this is shockingly mediocre, especially from a band who, two years earlier, were writing epics like ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""A Day in the Life."" Most songs here feature weak, annoying melodies and drugged-out, throw-away lyrics, and uninspired vocals. Their heart wasn't into this at all, and it shows. ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" is pleasant, at best, ""I Want You"" is inexcusably long, and the medley is excruciating slop. If you can sit through all that though, you will hear two of Harrison's finest compositions. It was those two that earned the album its 2 stars."
3,The Beatle's Only Overrated Album,"I Have been a Beatles Fan for a while now, and I always hear beatles fans say how Abbbey Road is Such a Masterpiece but I never understood what the fuss is about. The songs on The first Side With the Exception of ""Something"", ""Here Comes The Sun"" and ""Come Together"" Are rubbish and sound poorly produced. The second side is good but not great, The song are not finished and the beatles decided to link it together. The beatles are my favorite Group but Abbey Road Doesnt do it for Me Like RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER and THE WHITE ALBUM."
2,Still not seeing it,"I know I am probably wrong about this- the numbers after all do not lie: 294 five-star reviews vs. mine, but I still do not see what all of the fuss is about. The Beatles wrote some good, catchy songs and they were obviously quite influential in modern music. Nevertheless, after twenty-six years of hearing these jingles, they really have not grown on me at all. All the kings horses have failed to explain to me what exactly about the Beatles is that ingenious. It seems that the rest of music (here: rock n' roll) had pretty much lapped the Beatles by the time this came around. I have an image of hell as the constant replaying of Penny Lane over and over and over again. Funny thing is hell sounds a bit like commercial radio."
1,"Overhyped boy band with no musical talent, Stick with Jonas Brothers.","I Love rock n roll to the fullest, my favorite bands are Nickelback, Staind, Creed, and Kid Rock. One thing I absolutely hate is when boy bands try to disguise themselves as rock n roll groups. First of all, Mic Jagger can't sing at all on this album and why does he change his voice up so much!!! Second, just because a song is named ""Octopus's Garden"" doesn't make it good! lastly, if the Beatles want to have any success they should try to sing about better things like talented groups N Sync and Backstreet Boys. Mic Jagger and his band the Beatles have no place in Rock n roll and should take their garbage back to Australia!For good rock n roll stick with:1. Jonas Brothers2. Simple Plan3. My Chemical Romance4. Fall Out Boy5. Limp Bizkit6. Killswitch Engage7. Blink 1828. Coheed & Cambria9. Sum 4110. Nickelback"
5,Incredible CD,"This is probably the greatest album ever recorded. Abbey road was the lasty beatles cd recorded although let it be was released later. this album shows the creativity and inginuity of The greatest rock band of all time. Abbey Raod made bands like queen, kansas, and even led zeppelin possible. this CD revolutionized music more than any other album ever has. It is the Beatles at their best and will always be labeled as one of the greatest albums ever"
4,A classic album done well,"Finally the Beatle's remasters are out, and this one is great. I haven't owned a previous version of this album, so I can't compare to the older version(s). But the remaster is a audio treat! Crisp audio, clear vocals, a beautiful remaster. My only complaint is that the included Mac application that plays the ""making of"" video is for PowerPC Macs only. Intel Mac users will need Rosetta to run the app, or you can just find the video file in the data folder and run it via Quicktime player."
3,Puzzlement,"I recieved this album promptly, brand new, & sealed in it's box. The disc, however, will not play on my computer. It plays just fine in my CD player, but my computer cannot read it using Media Player, itunes, or napster software. this leads me to suspect that the problem lies with the laser unit in my computer, but this is the only disc out of literally hundreds I have tried that my computer will not read. I find this very disappointing as I have now purchased this music twice (originally on vinyl), & still can't synch it to my MP3 player, through which I spend 90% of my listening time. My next plan is to have my son try it on his computer. If he can rip & burn it to a new disc, then perhaps my computer will read that disc. Any assistance you might offer would be appreciated. Thanx, Don Zimmerman"
4,Abbey Road Vinyl,"I was very surprised by how well this recording sounded on my entry level system. The vinyl was very quietand I found myself hearing things during the playing of the recording that I don't think I heard before. Thevinyl itself was thicker than what I was expecting. I am not sure how this would sound on a better qualitybut for my money and my system, I am very happy. I bought the original the day of release in early October 1969.So, if you are in the market for a nice sounding copy, I think you will be happy with this."
5,The sum of the four is still greater than its parts,"On this album the Beatles all write well (including George and Ringo's best songs), play well (love the guitars in ""The End,"" the spare use of the moog synthesizer, the solid drum fills throughout...) and get produced mighty well so that it all sounds slick as oil. Oh, how they make these discarded melodic bits fit together with that medley. It's just so damn fecund. The Beatles don't owe us a thing - they gave us more than we callous fans deserve. What joy!"
3,another con?,"Thinking that I would have an enhanced listening experience, I purchased this remastered version of the Beatles' Abby Road. Despite all the hype, some of it definitely over the top, the sound isn't especailly better. I have listened closely to this new version with the '87 release and the difference is minimal. Moreover, as George Martin was not apparently involved with the new version, we no longer have any reference to how the Beatles actually conceived it to sound (instead we are left with the judgment of some engineer, who probably was a child when Abbey Road was relased). Not a waste of time exactly, but definitely not that big of a deal. Based upon this I shan't expend more money on the remasters; they simply aren't worth the cost. Frankly, it all appears to be a scheme to sell to us the albums and cds we already have."
5,The best is saved for last,"If you're craving some Beatles this is the album to get. Forget the early crap like ""Please Please Me"", cuz this album blows that one (and all the other Beatles albums) out of the water. This album can also be marked as a major breakthrough for Harrison as a lead guitarist. Everytime I heard ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" or the other early songs, I always wondered ""Do the Beatles really need Harrison?"". Well here he pulls out all the stops with his guitar. Just listen to the solos on ""Something"", ""The End"", or even ""Octopus's Garden"" and you'll get what I mean.All the tracks range from ""OK"" to ""Jaw Droppingly awesome"" but my favorite would have to be Lennon's 7 minute blues epic ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"". This almost sounds like a Led Zeppelin out-take that Page let the Beatles have (sexual lyrics, bluesy guitar riffs, and thundering vocals make it sound just like Zeppelin).So in conclusion, BUY THIS ALBUM. IT PWNZ THE OTHER BEATLES ALBUMS."
2,Overrated,"I like the beatles, but I'm not a fan of this album, their is too much hype about it. And remember Zeppelin kicked Abbey Roads off the top of the charts in 1969. Musically speaking by this time The Beatles had lost their musical strength. I do love Sgt. Peppers and Revolver oh and rubber soul was great too."
2,Not entirely brilliant,"I love The Beatles, let's just get that straight right from the start, but...Who ever is doing all the stereo remastering is off their rocker. If you're gonna take the tracks and re-do the mixes in stereo, please, do them in stereo. Not drums over here, bass over there, lead vocal in the center, piano on the left. Geeze. You would think that an engineer qualified enough to remix Beatle albums would have it together enough to do it well. Sorry, but I find this ""unlistenable"" and would gladly return it."
1,Sound Quality Rating Only,The music is wonderful BUT the sound quality is crap - it is thin and harsh. I have other CDs recorded in analog and remastered to CD that are vastly superior to this. I do not have the original record so I cannot guess as to whether the original recording was this bad. This was a great disappointment to me - I was so looking forward to hearing these songs in sonic splendour.
4,fab vinyl,bought this for my college age daughter who showed interest in vinyl..how better then with one of the gretest albums ever recorded....we both loved it Thanks
5,A far superior album !,"Abbey Road was indeed the best album of 1969(perhaps of all time),as other offerings like the stones let it bleed or the who's tommy were okay but had there share of filler,abbey road rocks from start to finish,and is reputed to be the beatles biggest seller!"
5,The Definitive Beatles Album,"Abbey Road is, in my humble opinion, the best album to ever come from The Beatles. That obviously says a lot for it, considering all of the wonderful things they gave us over the years. Abbey Road showcases The Beatles' genius and talent, their originality, and how much they progressed over the years. Their style had fully evolved by this point, to give us an album full of classics that rock as much today as they did when it debuted.There is great variety in the music on this album. You can groove along to Come Together, tap your toes to Maxwell's Silver Hammer, and sway along to the beautiful ballad's Something and Here Comes the Sun. Every song on this album is a classic, and no Beatles Collection can be complete without it."
5,The best album from the fab four,I am amazed to read the negative reviews being written about this album.Abbey road was one of the greatest albums ever made by any band with some of the finest songs ever recorded.An album to be bought by all music lovers with a good taste.
3,Oy ! What a Pain in the A%% This Disc IS !!,"Yes, it's remastered. Yes, *parts* of it sound remarkably better than the first CD version back in '86.But.1) If you want to listen to it on your PC, you had better make sure you have the latest versions of Windows Media Player and/or RealPlayer downloaded or else all you'll be able so see/hear is the ""additional features"" that come along with this disc. (That is...NO music)2) And, even after that, the last glorious minute of ""She's So Heavy"" has been cut off ! This is a tragedy beyond words.Those who hold ""Abbey Road"" as one of the greatest albums EVER will know what I'm talking about.The remastered Beatles catalog is certainly something to invest in, (Especially from ""Revolver"" on up) But Beatles fans be forewarned: What you gain in sound quality you lose in the gritty, original ""feel"" of the original recordings.My first response of, ""Get rid of the old vinyl and first edition CD's has been replaced with, ""Hold on to them tightly"""
5,The Beatles' Last Recorded Effort Packs Punch,"In 1969, after recording very long and tedious sessions with ""Let It Be"", the Beatles came together for their last recording, ""Abbey Road."" Their result was a record with pure rock and roll and thoughtful insight on politics, relationships, and by far, their best recorded track (personal opinion), ""The End."" Every track is wonderful. I would rate it 6 stars if I could."
3,Good Album,"Good album, especially side 2. On a corrective note, I have no idea where some of these Beatle reviewers get their ""facts"". On all of the Beatle recordings, Ringo did ONE drum solo. It is Ringo's solo near the end of side 2. Not Paul."
5,Flawless and brilliant.....as usual!,"The first use of synthesizers on a rock albums that made any sense (in contrast, please see the Notorious Byrds Brothers), but that's hardly the reason Abbey Road burns itself into your soul. George's two finest songs are both here (""Something"" - Frank Sinatra once called it the greatest love song ever written - and ""Here Comes The Sun""), and Ringo has a good song here, too (""Octopus's Garden""). John's compositions on Abbey Road aren't his best, but quite good anyway (""Come Together,"" ""Because""). Paul doesn't contribute any of his immortal ballads, but his impeccable musicianship is on display throughout (""Oh! Darling,"" ""She Came In Through The Bathroom Window""). And if you haven't heard his infamous ""pop symphony"" which dominates side 2, well, you haven't lived."
5,One of the Best Beatles Albums Ever,"This album is definitely one of my favorite Beatles albums; it sounds like they knew that this would be their last album truly working together, and they try to make their final impact on the music business, and they really do that very well with it. This album kicks off with one of my favorite Beatles tunes, ""Come Together"", then goes into the hopeful and soothing ""Something"". Another highlight is ""I Want You So Bad (She's So Heavy)""; it's 7 minutes of hearing basically nothing besides the title tracks and repetitious guitar riffs, but they do stick with you, and the jazzy element is also a ""cool"" thing, man. The whole B-Side to the album is amazing because it all flows through. They take a few seconds from one song and put it in another track and weave it all together. It is definitely a landmark for the Beatles catalog and is definitely worth owning."
4,Crap with some gems hiding in it,"The A side was good to average. Come Together, Because, Octopus's Garden and I Want You are great. The End is average...the rest is crap. No decent tune...half-assed lyrics, and no inspripation. The songs(minus the afore mentioned) arent finished by anyones standards. Hell ""Her Magesty"" is twenty seconds lond and is basicaly Paul talking fast. The album is in desperate need of completion."
2,Abbey Road,George Harrison's album...period.George's two tracks lifted an otherwise mediocre effort laden with self indulgent tracks by John (I Want You) and Paul's usual silliness (Maxwell's Silver Hammer) that dates back to the mid 60s. Here Comes the Sun and Something save the album.
2,OK,"I guess I understand how many Beatle fans automatically rate every Beatle album 5 stars, but to the unbiased reviewers, albums like Abbey Road just don't hold up. There are so many other artists out there who have released consistently better rock music than what is contained here.My recommendation is to focus on the early Beatle albums when the group was leading the pack, not the later albums where they had fallen seriously behind the times.Checkout A Hard Day's Night, or Beatles 1962-1966."
2,Abbey Road,"A nice try to capture some of the former magic, but only George gives us anything close with Something and Here Comes the Sun. Actually, ""Let It Be"" is the better of the final two albums, but either of the two is much more enjoyable than the White Album."
2,way WAY too much compression,"I believe this ""remaster"" will be considered one of the great sonic blunders of the CD age. There is too much compression on this thing-- it doesn't breathe, it doesn't feel in any way like a true performance. They were tempted by the sirens of compression, and they could not resist."
3,It's O.K.,"The Beatles' popularity was only rivaled by Elvis and Michael Jackson in his prime. This is one of the Beatles' best albums in their latter days as a band. My favorite track is Here Comes the Sun. The Beatles were to that generation what Marilyn Manson was to his generation and Britney Spears when she went shock rock to now yesterday's generation. The music is cool, I just prefer pop oriented metal to the Beatles' mature melodies."
4,Great Album,You should definately by this album. No two ways about it. But it gets kinda washy at the end.
2,Poor quality vinyl - great album,"For one of the best albums the Beatles made, the vinyl was below quality of an original vinyl album. I would have preferred a better quality product and would have been happy to pay more for it."
2,Nothing remastered about it,"I was thinking I was going to get something that was missing from the first remaster of some years ago, but what I hear is the same old sound that sounds no different from the first cd remaster of 1987 and then again in the box set from 2006. How many times will they remaster this cd? Can't they get it right the first time? The short video that comes with it may or may not make it worth buying. I leave that up to the collector. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Amazing (as all of them were),"while not my favorite beatles album, it is still amazing. The first side has great song after great song and the second side fits so well together and the trio at the end is perfection. great album, awesome cover, awesome band, and just one of their best albums.Highlights:Come TogetherSomethingOh! DarlingI Want You (She's So Heavy)BecauseHere Comes the SunGolden Slumbers/Carry that Weight/The End"
5,Best.album.ever,"If i had to choose the best beatles album and therefore the best album ever i would have to go with abbey road. Revolver,pepper etc are all great but this one tops them all. From the experimental and downright weird 'i want you' to the simple beauty of songs like 'because' & 'here comes the sun' this one is simply unbeatable. Even the quirky songs like 'octopuses garden' & 'silver hammer' are charming. A majestic Cd that belongs in YOUR collection!"
5,Could be the greatest album ever!!!!!!!!!,"It's been applauded and raved about for 34 years now as perhaps the greatest album ever,what more can be said...If your without this album,get it know!!!"
4,The Beatles - still appreciated today,This was a gift for a young friend. It was never one of MY favourites; however she was delighted.
5,This is THE album,"It's almost silly to write a review of this album because words can't describe it adequately. It's not just the best Beatle's album of all time, it's the best Rock n Roll album of all time. For one moment in history the world's best band was able to collaborate like never before. Each member was at their peak and Martin was there to produce a gem.I can't understand why this album is down to 4.5 stars. It almost saddens me. If you're new to the Beatles then this is the album that will make you a rabid Beatles fan."
5,And in the End...Greatness!!,"What can you say about ABBEY ROAD that hasn't been all ready written. In the ANTHOLOGY series, George Harrison states that 'they' knew it might be their last so they had to 'tidy it up' and make one more good record and the Beatles did not disappoint. The musicianship is on par. Listen to Paul McCartney's bass playing on SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW and on HERE COMES THE SUN..Excellent! Ringo Starr's drum solo during THE END..Great! George Harrison's complimentary contributions of SOMETHING and '..SUN' are his most perfect compostions that added more weight to the Beatles' song catalogue. Lastly, the guitar battle of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison in THE END shows that the Beatles knew what rock n roll was. Overall, one of the best albums in rock history!"
5,Anyone can tell me if it should include lyrics?,"This is a good Album, but I don't find andy lyrics pages in the CD case. Can anybody tell me if it should include lyrics? Thanks!"
2,Depends On Your Perspective,"I guess what some people see as a ""suite"" (where did THAT come from) I see as a group that could write a riff but couldn't complete any verses to go with it. Let's see. Exactly how long is Polythene Pam? A minute, maybe? The End? 15 seconds? Yeah. Great songs on this one. Maybe Rob Thomas could help finish up these songs. 2-stars."
3,good but still lacking,"Take out the songs that you can't even listen to such as /She So Heavy/Sun King/Because/- these are songs which lack creativity and rhythm. And why put in You never give me your money, it has the same rhythm as Carry that Weight. Why did they end in the ridiculous Her Majesty, and why is this overrated?...It is mere lyrics with simple beat. The Golden Slumbers lullaby is a brilliant ending. Come Together is an amazing beginning. Octopus' Garden and Maxwells silver hammer are very creative and essential to the Beatles culture. Mean Mr Mustard- what is the purpose of this song, Poythene Pam is humourous- (for whoever can understand the humour. The album needs editing, its needs filtering. It needs to be more concise in terms of style. Mixing good songs with crappy songs will produce a moderate album- which is exactly what Abbey Road is!"
1,Unfortunately dissatisfied,"As with the White Album, Abbey Road does not play with total clarity of sound as it is meant to. It will skip in a couple of places after only being played once or twice in my car - one of my favorite albums of The Beatles and one of the first of the remastered albums to supplement my collection."
1,Yield to Pedestrians Within Crosswalk,i wonder if those four russian fools got hit by a car while walking down that street. they were in such a hurry to have tea with Stalin that they forgot to look both ways before crossing!
1,Remastered - Awful sound,"Most definitely don't bother with the remastered version(S) they have vocals on one side of the room and the music on the other. Unless your stereo has the ability to combine both, do buy the mono, or origional stereo if available!!"
2,OVERRATED,A couple of good tracks like Because and the Medley on the second half. Content wise-utter rubbish. The Beatles recorded better whole albums then this. The half-assed effort on the last two productions is weak and they show.
2,genius??????,"i bought this album because a bunch of old dads have it.the cover is haunting!!!! but why weren't the beatles wearing any shoes? while listening to this album, i kept staring at their feet on the cover. does john lennon have a foot fetish?what did the beatles have against mr. mustard? why was he sooo mean? did he gun down mr. lennon?another question: why didn't ringo ever play the drums in front of the band? why was he always in the back? everyone knows he was the best, he was the only thing that kept the band together. he bought the pot, he wrote the songs, he drummed, he stabbed a baby. why did the beatles hate babies? why did they take a picture of themselves stabbing babies, and then throw it away? why go through all that trouble? did george write a book of dead baby jokes?why don't you listen to some grown-up albums, like Europop by Eiffel 65. blue (da ba dee)....my fav song ever, next to chocolate starfish and the hotdog flavored waterWHAT A BUNCH OF CRACKHEADS"
1,Not Satified,"This is not a music CD, but is a mini documentary. It is cute to see, but not what I wanted."
4,"Best Album Ever, Best Format Ever - Not The Best Remaster Ever","I love The Beatles, and Abbey Road is the favourite album of all time for me. But this is to let all prospective buyers of this vinyl know that it's the 1987 remasters being used for the pressing not the original 1969 master or the 2009 remaster.REPEAT: THIS VINYL IS A PRESSING OF THE 1987 REMASTER.The 1987 remasters were lambasted for fuzzy bass and tinny vocals and the vinyl really shows this. Why they didn't use the '69 master I'll never know."
3,How could they screw this up?,"Abbey Road is the best thing ever committed to vinyl. It's the reason Edison was put on this earth, to pave the way for these four men to make this music and save it for all of us. So how the heck do they allow such a bad pressing? Rainbo - really? The sound itself under the noise is really quite good but I can't imagine how they allowed these half-*ss pressings to go out. I'm returning mine and maybe trying a UK pressing. I hope they allow QRP to press the mono set - I'd hit that."
4,Not a pressing that compares to the 60's pressing on Apple,"I was almost extremely happy when I opened this new vinyl of Abbey Road and saw the apple label on the center of the record, then I noticed the capitol label insignia stamped in small print. I said to myself you can't have everything, so I put the disc on the turntable and the sound quality was not what I had expected from a new vinyl. I thought it may be my stylus, or cartridge. I then put on my old copy of Hey Jude and though there was some crackle at the lead in, the LP sounded like the Beatles were right there performing. For an old original Apple pressing that is over 30 years old to out perform a brand new pressing is quite a shame."
5,One of the best albums in music history,This is the best album from The Beatles. I've been a fan of them since I was 13! I know that was a long time ago in the 90's but I liked so many of their songs. They have a sound taht stands the test of time! This is definately their best album. Every song is great and get stuck in your head. This is my favorite Beatles album and you're music collection isn't complete without this one!
4,much Better than the early Beatles albums,"much better than the early Beatles albums,...good songs strong compositions.."
5,Another masterpiece.,"Anyone who doesnt love this album is off their rocker. Come Together and Something are brilliant songs and you can't reject Maxwell's Sivler Hammer and Oh Darling. In my opinion, the second side is not quite as good, but Here Comes The Sun is a masterpiece and I feel that You Never Give Me Your Money is one of the greatest Beatles songs of all time. The Beatles broke more ground by connecting each song into a ""rock opera"" kind of format, and face it, this group was infallible. Any way you wanna look at it, this album is a one of the greatest of all time."
2,Not a good first Kakuro book . . .,"I bought this as my first Kakuro book and found it disappointing because it doesn't have graduated levels of difficulty. Nothing on the cover or on the inside text indicates it isn't appropriate for beginners, but only after I've done 20+ ""medium"" puzzles in other books, am I finding I'm ready for Gordon's book. I find the cells a little small, but the paper quality is good for erasing."
4,Startling Portrayal of French prison system.,"Rene Belbenoit was guilty. There is no denying it, and he immediately owns to the thefts he committed. But the unbelievable hell that he endured on Devil's Island for more than fifteen years was above and beyond suitable punishment.In this tale, Belbenoit describes the harsh realities of not only Devil's Island in particular, but the French justice system of post WWI era. He tells of the millionairs son who is found ""unfit for transport"" and the two white collar fat cats who get a fraction of his prison sentence for stealing fifty times as much! He describes the ""perversions"" that men were forced into because of their woman-less circumstances, and how guards who falsely accuse inmates just to get their wine ration."
5,Possibly my favourite book,"I'm a little shocked by the tepid reviews of this book. It's one of the most gripping and fascinating books I've ever read. It's the true story of a man sentenced to the penal colony in French Guiana (Devil's Island was a picnic compared to the prison on the mainland). ""Papillon"" drew on this quite heavily but remains closer to fiction. If you like nonfiction, make sure you read ""Dry Guillotine."""
1,"Dry Guillotine is not a true story, or good fiction.","I read the first 30 pages. This is not a true story. The situations are ludicrous. The prisoner is said to be 90 lbs but can carry the book which is 30 lbs for years. A character is said he met the prisoner in South America and then a year later in the jungle in Central America. How that was arranged is not dealt with. At the meeting in Central America the prisoner states ""He wants to go to America. If he was in South America and meets this man in Central America. He must have crossed the Panama Canal. In the 1930's, the canal was considered American property. Why not ask for help there?There are many more. Meeting in Havard Club on Christmas Day. Using taps of letter location in alphabet to communcate. Very difficult.The real statistics of the death rate and horrible conditions prisomers at Devil's Island lived and died in are horrible. This book does not do justice to their suffering."
1,I can see why they're Discontinued,"This product, as with most other ATN products have turned out to be an expensive letdown. It would not give a reading. The instructions did not match the product and the item did not match the photograph. I will not be buying another ATN product, investing in quatlity the first time around beats throwing money away on an imitator like them then later having to buy something that works anyway. This product doesn't even deserve the star I had to give it in order to post this rating.Amazon did a good job of correcting the problem though, so the star is to their credit, not ATN."
5,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent product. The cologne smells great, and the aftershave balm is key in not getting razor burn. I will definately be purchasing more of this once my current supply runs out."
4,Like a cool tropical breeze,"I came to this album as a Jimmy Buffett fan -- Club Trini is made up of current and former members of his Coral Reefer band -- and found something both similar and distinctly different than what I was expecting.This album is almost entirely instrumental -- there are a few vocals on some of the tracks, but never enough to take the focus away from the music -- and it's a fusion of the music Buffett's fans might be familiar with, along with more ""pure"" Caribbean music and jazz. It's an effective blend, extremely pleasant and refreshing. I've used it as background music at parties and at work numerous times.It's also nice to see the Club Trini guys get a chance to get the spotlight. For better or worse, at Buffett concerts, the focus is on Jimmy or the show the audience puts on.A nice album and one that Buffett fans looking for something that's not quite as party-party-party as some of his albums are would do well to pick up."
4,A bit of Caribean Sunshine...,The first time I played this CD I knew it would reside in my CD player for the next several days. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have liked one or two more tracks featuring the vocals of Nadirah Shakoor who does a wonderful job on the third track 'Love Is Made Of This'.This CD is a good introduction to the steel drum magic of perhaps the world's premiere steel drummer Robert Greenidge. Parrotheads will hear Mr. Utley's contributions on keyboards as well.Upbeat and lively you can't go wrong popping this CD in the player on the way home from work or when you just feel like dancing around the house. Who cares what the neighbor's think.Overall a very pleasant listening experience.
4,Great Fun!,"This CD (and the other Club Trini releases too) are a nice cheap trip to the Caribbean. Steel drum music taken in a totally different direction. Since these guys are part of Jimmy Buffett's Coral Reefer Band, you have probably hear them without knowing it. Give this a try!!!"
3,still worth 99 cents,This edition does not have a navigable table of contents and has awkward line breaks in the longer poems. On the other hand it was only 99 cents.
2,The Complete Works is not really complete or completely legible,"The Complete Works is not really complete or completely legible. As a historian, I would really like this authentic version of photo copies of the original documents, but this book was to be for my mom and so needed to be legible throughout. I don't mind that some of the poems are missing parts, because, if they're missing, they're missing. But what disappointed me was the readability."
2,New WaterPic Flosser tips,Ours were also in the strips of 15 and they are not the same quality as the earlier product pictured. These bend too easily and are not even good for a single flossing. Bring back the old tips in the 30 pack.
5,Great Transaction,This item arrived quickly and was just as stated. These little things seem so expensive and this was the best price I could find anywhere
3,Poor Container holding flosser tips,"The flosser tips work very well with the power handle but the container holding the tips is about as poor as it can get. The containers I received with my last order did not look like the one in the photo and was a single strip design holding 15 tips. Due to one of the containers being defective, I had to throw the entire container away along with the tips. Waterpik really needs to get rid of this type of container and use only the one pictured that holds 30 tips as it is much easier to hold and works very well."
5,Best idea ever,Excellent way to maintain good oral hygiene. Flosser tips are kept secure and in one place until you are ready to use.
3,Meh.,"Loading the battery and the using the on/off/open switch was pretty straightforward. The changeable heads were nice, but the vibrations didn't seem to do what i needed.I'm sure if you're very sensitive or looking for a first toy this would be fine to experiment with, but it was not for me, which is really too bad. I'll keep it around and see if i can't make it work for me since i can't take it back or anything lol."
1,crappy product,This vibe has almost no power. I wouldnt even use it just to add to the fun during sex. It got thrown out after the first week.
5,A great comparative look at rational vs. irrational markets,"Mind Over Money is a very good compare-and-contrast discussion of two primary sides of the academic view of markets - the efficient market side and the behavioral side. It was released in 2010, so the financial crisis featured in the film's coverage, along with other historical market bubbles. Numerous interview clips of some of the most prominent proponents of each side are included (Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller being two of the highest profile).Overall, the documentary leans toward favoring the behavioral argument. The film provides a lot of evidence that we humans do not act rationally, especially where money is concerned. One of the more interesting experiments shown was how bubbles are created in the lab with experiment participants trading a depreciating asset. The video, though, does a good job of including contrary arguments as well.Definitely worth viewing."
5,Young or Old will enjoy!,Young or Old....or somewhere inbetween! Just Read all the Mr. Bumba Books and You'll be entertained and put in a good mood!
2,YAWN,"I have to disagree strongly with the rave reviews. (The number of low-priced ""new and used"" offerings seem to indicate this is not a five star winner.)It's not actively bad, but very, very dull. Flat, uninteresting characters doing very little and seemingly taking forever to do it. Maybe a half hour of actual plot in the whole series."
5,Fabulous,This is one of the best British series around. Wonderful. Thoughful. Funny. The acting is superb. Brilliant!
3,the last straw,"well this was the swan song for salt n pepa and the game changed it was all about lil kim, foxy brown, and missy elliot still worth a listen and if you feel snp you outta get this and recognize some real queens."
1,Wack.,I like Salt N Pepa but this CD was wack and generic they need to come back stronger before they fade away into obscurity.
3,WEAK WEAK WEAK!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO BUY THIS ALBUM,This album by salt n pepa is the worst since their last release. I'm very dissapointed in you guys. the only song I really enjoyed is Gitty Up.
1,Cos I can't give it a zero!,"This album is worth nothing,and they could have kept it. It has no meaning at all and all they think about is sex and money."
3,I now know why I didn't like the stories,"I have just finished the trilogy. It wasn't until the end of the last book that I realized that I was waiting for something good to happen. In each of the books, I kept thinking, ""what else could go wrong?"" and ""how much worse can it get?"". Well in each case we found out! I kept looking for the magic and warmth and happiness that came out in Jean Auel's and Linda Lay Shuler's books. The stories were good, but they were emotionally depressing. The end was not bad, but it was very predictable for the most part. I hate to sound so harsh, because the stories were good. Perhaps if I had known this ahead of time, I would have enjoyed them more. I would recommend these books to a friend, along with what I have just said. When Sue's Storyteller trilogy is finished, I will read them too. I will apply pessimistic optimism: ""Expect the worst and hope for the best!"""
2,Not quite up to par,"I felt this story was all over the place. After the first two novels being so good, I just found Brother Wind had too many minor characters now given major roles and a plot which was stretched thin. Too much time was also spent describing the actions of the villain. Surely, in a land where daily sustenance was a struggle villains would have less time to plot and plan? I gave up reading this story after the silly baby-swap/kidnapping bit towards the end. I guess I wanted to read about the good guys and had zero interest in the villains and their shenanigans."
3,"It was pretty good, but not as good as Jean M. Auel.","Brother Wind had a lot of historical facts and it blended in pretty well. Though, it didn't have to much action. It's was kind of dull to read at times. It has potential to be better."
5,It changed the way I look at the world.,"I just finished reading the last word of this last book of the trilogy: Mother Earth Father Sky; My Sister the Moon; and Brother Wind.These books literally sucked me into another time when spirits and nature were feared, respected, and treated as family. Now I find myself thinking differently, finding more joy in the world around me and in my own family.As a conclusion to the trilogy, the story line of Brother Wind was much more complex and thrilling than the first two books. The build-up to the climax kept me engrossed to the end - wonderful!If I have any quarrel with Brother Wind at all, it is that it focused largely on a very negative character, Waxtal. Although his actions were vital to the story, I missed hearing more about the strong, positive characters . A small complaint for such a compelling story.Now I must clean my ulaq and prepare food for my hunter. Good bye"
3,What happens next?,"I picked up these books to read while in Alaska on a first-time trip and continued to read them once back home until the end of this series. Generally it was a real basic and relaxing ""female"" kind of read with a lot of neat little ""fact-ettes"" thrown in. I saw the exhibit in the Alaska Museum in Anchorage and this was a nice ""topping"". I do feel like I am left at the end of what should have been a 4 or 5 book venture. What happens now to all the predictions about two of the main characters who get left as toddlers... And the villian was too excellent of a character! He couldn't really end up like he did? I will wait for a bit and one day read the next series~"
1,"Food Court Druids, Cherohonkees and Other Creatures Unique to the Republic",It thought it was more clever than it was. Same goes for the humor.
5,Amanda D,"The weird, long title of this book struck a chord with me and I had to open it up to see more. It's REALLY funny. It classifies idiosyncratic people like Stretchibitionists (desperate women who stretch provocatively at the gym), Hexpatriates (think Susan Sarandon), Cherohonkees (whites obsessed with Native Americans), and my favorite Soccer Lilies (soccer moms with lesbian haircuts). It reads almost like an art book because there are so many great illustrations. I picked up a couple copies for Xmas gifts. I don't know if I was hip enough for the Hipster handbook, but i definitely recommend this really smart, funny book. The part about the freaks at the office is funny too. ""Napoledrones"" still cracks me up."
2,A waste,I found this book to pretty much be a waste. Everything was very general. You pretty much need to get a state specific book to get what you want to know.
5,great stuff,"This is the greatest hardcore CD i have. It's just as good as minor threat. In this Defiance is way better than their first CD. This CD is a lot more agressive and harder. Great sXe music. Songs like, waiting, force of change, will to die, blistered are just great. I could live without the intro and outro though. It doesn't matter. everything between that is great. A must have CD for anyone"
2,This can't be the same game I played,"I got the game based on the glowing reviews here and at GameSpot. I can't believe these reviews were for the game I played. I was sorely disappointed. I really wasn't that impressed with the graphics, and the story is just weird. But the key point is, this game just isn't fun.If I could return it, I would."
1,HUH?,"Ive been waiting two years for this? This game is a joke.The graphics are nowhere near what the claims are.It waslike steppin' back into the seventies and playing defenderor something along those lines...Only it wasn't that fun!If you want killer graphics get Enclave...Every game shouldlook that good.There is no excuse for grainy or childishgraphics,in this day and age...It's just plain lazy."
1,TERRIBLE,THIS GAME IS STUPID ITS SO INCREDBALY BORING I PLAYED IT FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES THAN I COULDNT STAND HOW STUPID IT WAS. ONE OF BIGGEST DISSPOINTMENTS OF THE YEAR.MAYBE RENT BUT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT BY BUYING IT.NO WONDER THIS GAME IS BAD ITS ON XBOX
5,An amazing game,"This is an absolutely stunning game that any Xbox owner NEEDS to buy. This game plays better than Halo and Splinter Cell. And looks absolutely amazing! I have finished the game, but thanks to all the extra missions you can play through, the playtime is doubled. Buy this game now!"
4,NOT FOR SISSYS,"PDO was made by sega and the reaction from people is the same as one of their other games, Gunvalkyrie. The game is very hard and takes a while to master. Personaly i blew threw the story mode in an afternoon. It is short. The game is still fun because of the replay value. After i beat the game i played it again and again and again. Pandoras Box has lots of fun unlockables and if you are willing to put in the time then this game will be fun, trust me I have had the game for about a year and i still play it about twice a month."
2,two and a half.,"Boooooooooooooring. Ok, this probably isn't so bad if you're really into rap-rock. It's sort of half way between biohazard and RATM. It's definitely better than Limp Bizkit, POD, Kid Rock, or anything like that. Not as good as Rage though. It definitely has some hardcore elements, but is more polished and produced.This definitely has ""I take myself way too seriously"" vocals, but they somehow still sound less dumb than biohazard. Probably the biggest drawback here is that you'll only want to listen to the album 5 times or so, before you don't feel like hearing it again for another couple years.I'd rather listen to shelter's mantra. And that's pretty low."
3,almost great,"This is a pretty good CD. Some of the songs are really put together well, and the lyrics are quite thought provoking. I particulary don't like how he rips on Zack from Rage Against the Machine in the opening song Anger. It almost sounds as if he's jealous of Rage and their success of meshing hardcore riffs and politics, it seems as if Downset wish they were in rage's position. This pre-pubescent angst showed by the lead singer against Zack just makes downset look like limp bizkit lyrically."
5,great book; great seller,"This was a great book; nothing 'earth shattering' but really fun to read, and very interesting! It was clear it was a labor of love for the authors! And the seller sent this so quickly, I was really impressed! Thank you; it was my 'airplane book' for a trip. Great choice!"
1,Digging Up Nothing,"This book is a travelogue with descriptions of worms in the shower, throw-up, shaving legs, and running up and down stairs. The transitions are poor between travelogue and discoveries. If everything that is filler was left out there might be two chapters worth of legitimate material. For someone who wants to find out what the authors know about Butch Cassidy FOR SURE, it is a hard read.Contrary to what one review here said, the authors do make the definite assertion that Butch and Sundance died in South America, but the lack of evidence does not back this assertion.If one likes travelogues of South America with some digging around for papers and unearthing graves that produce negative results you will like this book...but you have to concentrate to dig up what is hidden in the pages."
2,Meh,"While I appreciated all the work that must have gone into her travel and research, Anne Meadows is in desperate need of an editor. This book drowns under mind-numbing, unimportant detail. This would have been so much better in the hands of a real investigative journalist, or someone used to writing investigative or historical non-fiction. Wonderful effort, pretty poor execution."
2,"An informative, but poorly presented, story of the times","1898 establishes this time-period as the adolescent growth spurt of America. We learn of the crucial players and ideas that brought America to world-class status. Unfortunately, the presentation is chaotic, and reveals few coherent themes. The level of detail is quite uneven. For instance, the author describes the emerging philosophy of conservationism in three pages, but he details the Spanish-American war down to the level of what the men ate for breakfast each morning. We learn, for no identifiable reason, of an adulterous affair of one of the siblings of President McKinnley. While nice gossip, such tangents do not contribute to the theme the author is trying to establish, which is America's transition to prominence."
4,Pretty Good!,"I had to read this book because of a school assignment, but if I didn't have to, then it would have been an even greater book. The insights he shares with his readers are well put, & the anecdotal form makes the book move fast, which keeps the book interesting."
3,Interesting book,"I found this book to be interesting and an easy read. I thought it pretty jumbled in its presentation, though, and not very meaty. Don't buy it expecting anything great & inciteful -- sort of like a USA Today approach to history lite. Good beach reading."
3,3 1/2 stars first chapter,"This is alright but it is last on my Mobb Deep album list this came out when I was juvenile my favorite songs is ""Peer Pressure"" and the remix this is alright the reason I didn't give it a 1 star becuse this mobb deep's first album and i'm not a hater this is alright just have this album."
4,"""JUVENILE HELL"" IS NOT THE BEST BUT MOS DEFINATLY BANGIN.","WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE SINGLE ""SHOOK ONES PT. 2 I HAD TO GO PICK UP ""THE INFAMOUS"" ALBUM. AND IT IS THE BEST CD EVER MADE TO ME. THE THEY CAME WITH ""HELL ON EARTH"". ONE TIME I WENT IN A RECORD STORE TO GO PICK UP OME MORE CD'S THEN I SAW ""JUVENILE HELL"" I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY MADE AN ALBUM BEFORE ""THE INFAMOUS"".THIS ALBUM IS DEFINATELY FOR DIE HARD MOBB DEEP FANS LIKE ME. THEY WERE PRETTY YOUNG THEN. BUT IT STILL HAS THE THUGED OUT FLAVOR THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM MOBB DEEP.FAVORITE TRACK:PEER PREASURE"
3,Soon to be Infamous.....,"I just ordered this cd, and glad I did. If you're a true MOBB fan, you'll want this in your collection because you can see where HAV and PEE started off from. The bangers ""Hit it from the back"" and ""Peer pressure"" are the singles, and both have great lyrics. Knowing MOBB roots is a key in being a true MOBB fan, its cool to see their style mature as the years pass."
4,grimey...,"For some unknown reason, at least 50% of Mobb Deep's fans are unaware that ""The Infamous"" is not their debut album, and that this album preceded it in '93. ""Juvenile Hell"" is not as developed or massive sounding as The Infamous, but instead has rough, funky (and quite dark)beats from start to end, and very decent emceeing. Best track is saved until almost last - ""Project Hallways"" will have your neck bobbin', even if you haven't got a neck: it's that funky.Pick this up if you like Mobb Deep but for some reason don't know about it."
3,Intro on Mobb Deep,"The rapping-duo from Queensbridge, first hit us with Juvenile Hell and didn't leave us with much imaginiation. This is neither a classic or an album that revolutionalised hip-hop, but did gives us things to come from two of Queensbridge's favourite sons. Back in '93 Mobb Deep didn't get the success, until they hit us with ""The Infamous"", they fell in the same trap as Fat Joe did with his first joint ""Fat Joe Da Gangsta - Represent"", but they obviously came off better than Joe who struggled for a few years. Anyway, Mobb Deep came with an album that wasn't half bad, considering it was done by two emcees who were in their teens which I think many teens should have listen to before getting into Hip Hop and listen what they should be competing with and also should be showing improving. That's another problem with Hip-Hop these days, Hip-Hop artist are not hungry enough to shine against their peers and they end up sounding like everybody else."
3,A Fund Raiser?,"I'm not sure this is a book at all. It rambles on and on and it's only 200 pages. We do learn a little western history, a little McMurtry history, but it all has litle consequence. I think the purpose was to raise money (surprise, surprise). Must be his projects in his old hometown need support."
2,I actually had to stop reading it,"I guess I just didn't get it. It started out pretty good, got really dull then had some interesting thoughts on personal healing after cardiac complications. Overall I thought it was a poor example of his work. I would've rather eaten glass."
2,bored birds,My parrots didn't seem to enjoy plucking this toy as much as I thought they would. Would not buy again
3,ok razor,"This item was right for the price.It shaves pretty close,but unless you are use to shaving with this kind of razor, which I am! I found it to be alittle rough on the skin.jetback"
2,Great trimmer but the shaver sucks!!,"The shaver doesnt work at all, I actually tried it on a hairy part of my body prior to trying it on my face, and it did not work. The trimmer did a good job but nothing like shaving would do."
5,great shaver for the price,"I switched after going to my barber and he was using this product with the super close foil. I switched from a panasonic which cost 3 times more. It works great chrged once in 2 weeks and I use it evry day. I have ordered the super close foil but the close works good just takes alittle longer to shave. good ,close ,smooth. I have a tough beard."
5,Running the time,"Ok, I do admit, that this is not the first political Rip-Hop sudo Hip-Hop artist to be left winging it. From the originators of Consolidated can you be surprised at the material. But never the less I believe for its time it was a grate album, with some strong messages that allowed you to decide on the political topic on your own. Unlike Consolidated witch I believe just threw one sided topics in your face, more of a SHOCK value than trying to make you think. But If your like some of these other drones saying that this guy stinks and can't rap just because his lyrics don't rhyme, then don't buy the album "" GO BUY BRITTNY SPEARS "" It's cool if your not into the hole political RIP-RAP, But don't bash this artist just because he doesn't conform. Personally I think the beat is still good for 2003 and he's messages are still as strong. ""Just my thought"""
1,Politics and music,"Hip-Hop is an amazing form of expression. However this is just not a good album. I know most of us want to believe in it because of the political messages spewed forth by Franti, but it is just not good music. While I do think Micheal Franti does have an astonishing way of explaining the world, it does not translate well into rhyme. Try De La Soul or Lords of the Underground for GOOD poly hip-hop."
5,Nice little book with GREAT photos,"The content of Burgess's book is very good as you'd expect, but as a graphics/visual person I'll opin that what really makes it shine are the photos. Burgess has a great eye, especially for diver photos which really put the beautiful scenery in context. Recommended."
5,Great Information on a Difficult to Discuss Topic,Ms. Webber does a wonderful job of bringing a topic to the light that many find difficult to discuss. She talks about how some shy away from colon cleansing (enemas) due to unfortunate experiences as a child or from an uncaring medical professional. The enema does not have to be a painful procedure and can be very beneficial in a healthy lifestyle. Brave individuals allow themselves to be photographed to allow for clear and easy to follow instructions. The CD is very informative and I highly recommend it for anyone slightly interested in improving their colon health.
4,A new Classic,"This work is so helpful, and beautifully executed that it couldengage many people who just appreciate good advise, the written word, and elegant photography. We only wish for more."
3,Didn't like the smell,"This works ok, but the fragrance is kind of sickening sweet. I'll just use a body polish from the drug store."
5,nice,"This roll-up travel jewelry tote is exactly what I needed for traveling. It holds a LOT of jewelry and keeps it mostly untangled. The fabric is soft and thick enough. The description doesn't really say, but it doesn't really roll up, but rather folds in thirds, which is actually nicer for fitting in your luggage or carry-on. You can hold rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and watches. Some of the snaps are too tight and will pull right through the fabric if you're not careful! Other than that, it's a great piece."
1,Ruining a classic,"Home for a Bunny is one of the best books for children that I have ever read. Having said this, l hope that the people looking at this edition note that there are new illustrations mixed in among the original Garth Williams illustrations. I want the same version that I had when I was three and had the book memorized. New illustrations are completely unnecessary."
5,A memorized book that found a home in our hearts.,"My son is now 24 years old, yet I can still recite Home for a Bunny from memory. Recently, when I asked him what his facorite story book was he did not hesitate to say, ""Home for a Bunny."" We both agreed the book re-inforces the fact that there is a place for everyone. It may not be like anyone else's but it is just right for someone."
4,Home for a bunny,"Same wonderful story I remember from childhood, but a bit disappointed that it wasn't the oversized book that I had enjoyed. This is not the small book either, but I was expecting the larger size"
1,Needed it for a class,Boring with no new insights. Just like the class I took it for. But I sold it back as soon as the class was finished.
3,Not very helpful,"This is an uninteresting book about an unintersting place. It has never existed as a separate entity for more than 20 years at a time. It was always part of Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, Ottoman, or Soviet hegemony. Save the Cossack uprising of the 17th century, nothing worth writing about has ever happened here."
4,You don't have any choice but only this book,"Good exercise book with precise explanation, however you should have spare time to review 1000+ of questions. CISA exam is simpler than this exercises, don't worry about it if you don't get the right answer most of the time.Should have fun to read this book although it is quite expensive"
4,The Neglected Iguanas Album,"At the time it was released, Super Ball was a disappointment comercially. And for some Iguanas fans it was so-so artistically. BUT ... hindsight has given this CD its long overdue, well, due. It spawned songs like ""Benny's Cadillac"" that remain live staples to this day. Heck, I think I heard the band play ""Rock Star"" last month. Perhaps Super Ball will remain the ""transitional"" album between the clearly great debut and Nuevo Boogaloo in the beginning and the band's latter day releases Sugar Town and Plastic Electric 9 Volt Heart. It's a keeper nonetheless."
1,low point for the iguanas,"Anne Rice's Iguanas.... After the first two albums this is depressing. The first two albums are solid 4 star and ""Sugar Town"" is a return to something familiar. Maybe they are casting out the demons of Margartiaville here?"
3,"DON""T BUY THIS IF---","Don't buy this dvd set if you already have the first Dick Van Dyke Show DVD, as this set has the EXACT 6 same shows on it--""The Night The Roof Fell In"", ""Never Name A Duck"", ""Show Me Your Walls"", ""A Man's Teeth Are Not His Own"", ""Hustling The Hustler"", and ""Bank Book"". They mislead you by saying there are 10 episodes, but only 6 are The Dick Van Dyke Show. The other 4 are The Lucy Show-- ""Lucy Meets John Wayne"", ""Lucy The Fight Manager"", ""Lucy Meets Tennessee Ernie Ford"", and ""Lucy Gets Caught In The Draft"". I already had ALL these SAME episodes!!"
5,"If this isn't great, nothing is!","""Retro Active"" is classic DL with a bunch of hits usually not heard on radio.""I wanna be your hero"" and ""She's too tough,"" are the best from this track. I must say, if DL can make great albums from B-sides, than they are truly a great band! The only complaint I have is that they have ""Miss You in a Heartbeat"" and ""Two Steps Behind"" on here a bit too much. Hey, we like the songs, but do we need to hear them more than once on a CD?"
5,An incredible collection of B-sides and unreleased tracks,"Retroactive is a great collection of B-sides and previously unreleased tracks. Def Leppard has always held back some of their strongest tunes as B-sides. Here, these songs get their chance to shine. ""Desert Song"" and ""Fractured Love"" are two dreamlike, mystical rockers that flow together like one song. ""Action"" is a high-speed shot of adrenaline. ""Ring of Fire"", ""She's Too Tough"" and ""Ride Into The Sun"" are straight-ahead rockers. ""From The Inside"" is a dark, acoustic piece with powerful lyrics. And ""Miss You In A Heartbeat"" is a beautiful song, which sounds great in all 3 versions on this CD. The only disappointment is the electric version of ""Two Steps Behind"", which sounds like an intentional parody of the song. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes the music of Def Leppard, whether it be their old stuff or more recent releases."
5,What can I Say!,"What can I say, other than this is yet another fabulous record by the great Def Lepard! Will the hits ever stop, I certainly hope not! From the beginning to the end nothing but pure electicity! Some of my favorites are: ""Fractured Love"" a sort of jumpy, catchy toon, then ""Two Steps Behind"" which I am sure most people have heard, from the movie,(Last Action Hero) but you get two versions of this one! Next we have a love song, ""Miss You In a Heartbeat"", also two versions, just great guys, and then on to, ""Ride into The Sun"", western style and ""From the Inside"", great message in this one! I could go on and on but you will have to find out for yourself. Beleive me, if you are a Def Lepard fan, you'll love this one!"
5,Highly recommended Brit Hair Metal,One of the 90s British glam metal bands that cross over from the 80s! Thanks to them for having accompanied my youthful teenage years... The 90s British music scene will be boring without them!!!
1,Just in case....,"Just in case you didn't have enough Def LEppard songs with love in the title......this band cannot write music to save their lives, all they do is write radio friendly pop garbage about love, stiff love, soft love, high love, low love....my god get some writers to help you. Believe it or not it gets even worse after this....."
4,good jams,"great cd, bit heavier and darker compared to some of there other albums. and even though the band has changed sounds a little over the years you can still hear that true def leppard style in there that cemented them in rock history, and knowing that after all the other bands that have disapeared from that era, lep still got what it takes to rock."
5,Retro Active,"Great CD!!! The last of the Steve Clark era. Sure do miss that guy. ""Miss You In A Heartbeat""!! ;-( Great songs!! Long Live Leppards!!! :-X"
3,A good collection,"This collection is a good sample of leppard's not so well know songs, some b sides and alternate versions of known hits. Not all the songs are great but they are decent. What is truly missing is some rocking' b sides I do remmember from the Hysteria singles but is better than nothing, and they sound better here than in vinyl. It's not and awesome and complete collection but is ok."
4,This Should Have Been Adrenalize,"It's amazing to think that instead of releasing Adrenalize they could have released these songs along with ""Tear It Down"" and had the album out in 1990 instead of 1992. ""Ring of Fire"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Hero"" were much too good to just be B-Sides for Hysteria. ""Desert Song"" and ""Fractured Love"" are also great as is ""She's Too Tough"". This really is more of a complete album than a rarities collection and these songs stand up to anything else they've released. If you're a Def Leppard fan you need to own this album."
5,Rewritable DVD media,Good quality media with no problems and seems to be reliable and the price was very reasonable.
2,Limited re-write capability,"These discs SEEM to be OK for something you want to keep, but that's not the purpose of re-writeable discs. I find that they fail after being re-written 4 or 5 times. I'm going back to using Verbatim."
1,One coaster .. for now,I bought this on the recommendation of my DVD vendor's documentation (LG). I didn't expect it to fail from disk 1 !
3,"Too many shapes, not enough rods or spheres","I think the Geomag and similar products are really cool and my 3 year old likes them, too. However, I wasn't that happy with this set. There are too many plastic shapes and not nearly enough rods and spheres. There are only enough to go around about 4 of the plastic shapes - and that's if they are connected together. This would probably be a good addition if you already have many rods & spheres, but it is definitely not a good starter set."
4,Rick Steves Italy,Great DVD package. Like the realistic approach explaning the cities do's and don'ts. We will soon see if we learn what we have been taught.
2,oh my!,"boring boring boring, i was so disappointed with this one, i have learnt my lesson, stick with just the one disc the others always let you down :("
2,Definitely underwhelming,"Boring book with a plain-looking girl on the cover.Here's the story--a girl is ""in love"" with two guys who are mad about her. Of course, they are two of the most popular and good-looking guys in the school. Then a third guy becomes interested in the plain girl and she must choose between all three guys who are very different. Obvious and silly. Don't bother reading it"
1,One Book Too MAny,"Honestly!I can't tell you how much I hate Sweet Dreams.Do I even NEED to describe th eplot to you?Ok,well this(tarty)girl(you have to call her a tart)is dating 2 boys,and falling in love with another one."
5,Must have!,This book is a 'must have' for every SSR Owner!!!!!!!!!!! A detailed account of the Chevrolet SSR from concept to market.
2,Think about it....,"The size and capabilites of the watch are perfect however, it does not stay white and the plastic turns a dingy yellow fairly quick. It's so inexpenisve because the materials are cheap."
2,A little disaapointd,"I'm a little disappointed with this watch...works great but is clear and not white...second, it turned a really bad yellow color in less than a month of wear...would not recommend you wer it in sun, which is ironic because it is a water prrof watch"
1,Way OVER PRICED,"This cologne is way over priced.Has a good scent.Flip side is does not last even 1 hour.You can even put it on your cloths ,and in even in less than one hour the scent is gone.Its like John vavartos which also does not last."
1,No es de buena calidad,Aquí en Venezuela compre una colonia igual y es otra calidad! La que compre en Venezuela es de excelente calidad y la que vende Amazon es chimba que parece imitación.
4,The best shooting game ever!,This game is one of the best shooting games ever because it has the most realistic graphics and it is even better when you play Ghost Recon online with other people from around the world!
4,It does not get much better than this !,"I own ~10 X-box games and this is the only one I play. I simply can't get enough! It is a regular routine, my wife goes to sleep and I play Ghost Recon! It just gets better and better! I used to play Halo and now, looking back, Halo ""is bad"" compared to this game (not that it is bad but Ghost Recon is just soo much better). Buy it... Rent it... what ever you have to do to play this game!"
3,yawn,"I've never been in combat. I doubt I'll ever be in combat. It is my understanding that a great deal of combat involves sneaking around, scuttling through underbrush so as to remain undetected, and basically trying to make oneself as invisible as possible. Therefore, this game deserves credit for trying to depict that aspect as realistically as possible. But in my opinion that does not necessarily translate to fun gaming.To be fair, I gave up on the game during the first level of the single player campaign. Maybe it gets better; I don't know. But after about the fifth time I got killed by an enemy soldier without ever even seeing him, I got a little frustrated. Sure, that's probably how it would happen in the real world. Guess what? I DON'T CARE about the real world when it comes to video games. I want to have fun, and that is all.For me, ""Ghost Recon"" fails miserably in the fun area."
4,"Game of the Year, again!","Tom Clancy's detail about weapons and tactical maneuvers made Ghost Recon the PC ""Game of the Year"" according to the magazines. This should be a great game for the Xbox."
3,Recon,"Definitely a more intelligent and realistic gamethan Conflict Desert Storm but,it wasnt as fun to play,atleast not for me.I don't mean to slam this game in anywaybecause it's obvious they put alot of time and effort intomaking this a believable game,it's just not all that fun afterConflict Desert Storm.Maybe it's a little too realistic."
2,This game was awful,"This game should never have been made. I rateit as follows.graphics- 7Story line- 7everything else- 1I give microsoft credit for the graphics and for the sweet story line, but every otherpart of this games is awful. To start off you can't see anything in this game. I beat the game and only had to shoot 10 people. my team of 6 did everything before i got a chance to. I would be walking a long and one of my guys would shoot a bad guy that i could see on my screen. I had to walk around with zoom on the entire time just so i could kill one guy. the guns on the other hand were pretty cool but they were almost to realistic. i liked halo where i could pick up guns as i went along. in this game the guns i start wiht are the guns i keep for good. another thing that stinks is getting shot. unlike halo where you have a sheild in this game if you get shot once you are dead. i recomend this game if you are into intense strategy/realistic shooter games..."
2,pretty terrible,"i thought this game would be good but i was very dissapointed when i played itcons:terrible graphics,enveriments need worked on,cant see your gun,cant tell if enemy or on your sidepros:coop mode,you can pick what type of soilders you want with you"
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME!...,"Please read this. Althought this is a great game, the XBOX version is full of bugs, and neither UBI or Microsoft is doing anything to correct it. Please visit the support forum on their website and look at all the issue's with freezing and on-line play. The fact that UBI won't even respond makes this game not worth buying."
3,good gameplay but the command interface: not so good.,"Operation Desert Storm and Splinter Cell spoiled me. Ghost Recon suffers from a silly command interface. Trying to use it to direct troops into battle is just awkward. The actual gameplay is great, but I found myself leaving B squad at home during missions because it's a paintrying to command them, squad A, and accomplish missions.Game might be good for multiple players but for a single person, bah. Better games with easier-to-use interfaces.Graphics are decent - They resemble WWII Online."
4,*I can see you*,"Ok....so the game is a lot like Rainbow 6, so sue me, i love this game!! First, you get to meet many new people, in remote areas, and kill them, and.....you get the idea. The game does have Xbox Live, but i havent installed that yet, so i cant say much on that, but i hear good things. The only reason that this game is given only 4 stars, is because of the very difficult first level (for someone that doesen't have the base of the game down, it is near impossible). For a free hint: take it slow, the bad guys blend in as well as you. The 1st level is a pain, but after you finish that level, easy street. As usual, you will have to deal with night vision, guns, bad guys, guns, UN troops (they are constantly in need of help), guns and my fave.....GUNS (note that i dont like real guns, just the ones in video games)"
5,Ghostly Recon Review,This game rocks! It's a fun tactical game! This game rules over Medal of Honor. Every XBox owner should get this game!
2,Over-Hyped,"The game is boring, you shot people from a distance with your sniper rifle. Big Deal. You've seen it all before. I solved this game in 3 nights with very very light game play. There is nothing more to really say about it...."
2,VERY disappointed,So I bought my X Box last year JUST for this game. I waited and waited and waited. Original release date was March of 2002 and they kept pushing it back. Finally was releasd last week and when I finally got it...it just plain [inhales with force]. Graphics I give a 5 stars. Playability I give 1 star. First person view [inhales with force]. Online play slow and lagging. Just not a very good game. I've been playing SOCOM: Navy Seals on PS2 and was expecting somthing along the lines of this game. Boy was I wrong. UBI needs to look at how SOCOM was made and make serious changes to the Tom Clancey game lineup. Save your money and get Unreal Championship or Splinter Cell for X Box or SOCOM: Navy Seals for PS2.
4,good but at the same time it's boring,yes the game is very good. i havent got the chance to play it online. I still play tournaments with friends. the controls in this game ( out of 5) is a 3.7. they are hard to master. gameplay is a 4.9. there can be some rough spots. A.I for your team mates is a 2.2. they get in the way causing you to get shot a lot.enemy A.I is a 5 they are very smart.graphics are a 4.10.there can be object that need to be 3d that are 2dfun factor is most definatley a 5. This game is addictive.there is so much good thing to write about this game. Levels are emerse and interactive. fire fights make you feel like you are actually on the battle field.the weapons shoot just like the real thing. Overall the game is interesting. every level will want you to keep playing. shorty z was here. oh yeah if any one out ther knows the lowest price for socom tell me.
4,Nice Job,"This game is very fun.It does not have a very deatailed story (at that memorable)so do NOT expect anything about that here.THere are 4 classes you can choose:Rifleman,Support Gunner,Sniper,and Demolitions.This game will have you go through 12+ missions with objectives from securing a place to destroying an enemy armor.One of the best things about this game is Xbox Live play.You can do Coop and Adversarial (Coop being better).My one problem is BAD single-player.There is no memorable plots or levels that make you shout ""AWESOME.""Thats the one downpoint.Models are better than the PC version,but if you are looking for REALLY cool enviorments pick up Island Thunder.Overall this game is good but could be better,but still is a buy."
5,Ghost Recon,"This game is awesome,and you people rate this game at 104 it should be in the top twenty, definatly. You people rate Buffy the Vampire Slayer at 11 you sickening, Ghost Recon is a 1000times better."
1,very upset!!!,I ordered this game for my brother and when I played it to make sure it worked(i had a funny feeling about it) nothing happened! i was so upset and i wasn't going to pay or go through the process of returning it through amazon so i am taking it to my local gamestop and trading it in there for a gamestop gift card where he can buy a used one there that is guaranteed to work! this really made me upset because i have had such good luck with amazon
3,Ghost Recon,"I'm a big fan of Ghost Recon 2 and Summit Strike. These really didn't tickle my fancy with the gameplay of it and everything else. I guess you have to start and work your way up, uinstead of working your way backwards throught the Ghost Recon series as I did."
3,Disapointment,"I am a huge Tom Clancy fan. I have played all of his games on the PC and played very heavy with online gamers. When I seen they had this on X box I was very excited, but shortly ended up disapointed. The graphics are good, but I could not seem to get anywhere at all. I can say the dificulty level for this game is a lot higher then PC version. The person is a lot harder to control on Xbox compared to the PC."
5,A Video Game for the Age's,Ghost Recon is a very solid game with great graphics and excellent gameplay. The missions and the game as a whole is original and will excite even the dullest of gamers. An Amazing Game!!!
5,GREAT game must have,This game is one of the best games that i have bought for my xbox so far besides halo but i highly recommend it for anyone who likes military war games.
2,Too easy,"Instead of proceeding on to more difficult challenges as the game progresses, the game presents a difficult mission followed by several relatively easy missions. Did not play the game much but was easily able to finish it. I have never played the game with XBox live so I can't comment about whether that makes the game more fun or play last longer."
4,A very nice game,"The good: graphics(wow), sound(wow), the idea of controlling a team or 2 teams of men through special forces combat, the storyline, and more. But....could have a little longer levels, and I personally would like either team or individual control. The AI does not always have your team helping you in the most advantageous way and sometimes not at all...I would dearly love to be able to position each man with his own orders in some instances.....sigh if that were the case, no more being flanked by the enemy on some levels. Worth the money!"
4,Great Game,"Ghost Recon is a great game released in a month of great games. It has great strategy elements, starting from the mission planning, picking a team, and in the actual mission. You can't just walk the streets and shoot 'em up. You have to hide, sneak around, take out the snipers, etc. The only reason this game doesn't get 5 stars for me is that the graphics could be a little bit better. If you have dolby digital 5.1, it will really help you in this game, as you can hear shots being fired from different directions. Highly recommended."
3,do not purchase if you have a gen 1 xbox,"The game will continue to lock up on one or multi or online games if you have a xbox with an older dvd player, pretty disapointing."
4,Ghost Recon - the best Online experience,"Ghost Recon is the killer app for XBOX Live! This game has it all but I found the online capabilities to be the most compelling feature. The environment is a relatively controlled environment with only up to 16 online players. I think they were smart to put a limit on the players because it keeps the pace and flow true to what you would expect in war, unlike many other online games' frenetic war-play style.Those other games are definitely fun to play but they are `unreal', or should I say `less real'. If you are looking for real combat action, go Ghost."
4,"Great, Intense Game: But Crashes alot","I thought the realistic effects: graphics, sound, great game control were excellent.My problem with it is it makes my xbox crash much more than any other game I own. It is hard sometimes to complete a mission when it crashes over and over again in the really graphic intense scenes.But overall, a really fun, realistic game."
2,[Not Worth the Money],"I recently bought Ghost Recon ... When I got home I started it up. After a few minutes I thought,"" This is it?"" This game is good graphic wise but it is not worth [the Money].On multiplayer you get to pick Cooperative, Adversarial, and Tournament. Multiplayer is the only ""GOOD"" about this game. But its still cheesy. The enemies AI is TOO good. You'll be up on a mountian and zoom in with your scope and the enemy will notice and start firing at you, and 9 times out of 10 you die. It is hard to beat it on Recruit. It would be impossible to beat it on Veteran. Trust me. If you want a good action game dont buy this. ... Here are my Pros/Cons.Pros:Good graphicsNice soundO.K. MultiplayerCons:Unrealistic AICheesy Options andd Map ScreensHard ControlsNot Tom Clancy's Best Work..."
5,Insight and comfort...,"...is what Mrs. Greene provided for my mother after we lost my Dad. They had a long and happy marriage and while we had plenty of warning that we would lose Dad, she was understandably inconsolable when he died... ...until she read an article by Bob Greene about his mother's book. I can honestly say, she started to turn the corner while reading this book and has read it many, many times. I am online tonight buying a copy of it for my mother to give to one of her friends who recently lost her husband. I hope Mrs. Greene knows what a profound and generous contribution she has made to many grieving spouses. I personally would like to thank her for helping my mother resume her life and begin to find happiness again.Buy the book, you won't regret it."
4,Great book for young children,"This book was just what I needed for my child when she got her first loose tooth. We read this multiple times and she enjoyed looking at the illustrations on why we have loose teeth and what happens when they fall out. She wasn't upset or scared with the whole concept.Now the only thing I did not like about the book was the manner in which the children were illustrated. They aren't very cute or interesting to look and some might be a bit scary. My child didn't mind, but I gave this book as a present to another child and she didn't want to even look at it because the children were ""ugly"". (I'm not saying that all children should be pretty or cute in stories, but I'm giving the overall initial impression by young readers).So if they children were illustrated a little ""friendlier"" I would have given it 5 stars. I think it will depend on the individual reader as to whether that will be too much of a distraction."
2,Nothing Special,"There's nothing special with this shampoo. It doesn't smell that great and it doesn't lather much. I found the American Crew Peppermint Cleanse to lather much better and is a fraction of the cost. Plus, the claims that this prevents hairloss are pretty dubious based on the ingredients.Also, be wary of the reviews of the Billy Jealousy products on Amazon. If you check the other reviewers for this item, you'll see that they only reviewed other Jealousy products and they were all posted on the same day. Seems like Billy himself is appraising his own products, and now I know why!"
4,My one and only Shampoo.,Ive been using this shampoo for over a year and although i cant tell I see re-growing I see much more less hair falling. It smells great. It gives a nice tickling feeling to your scalp when you put it on.I love it.
2,umm when does the cool stuff happen?,I bought this because I like this companies shave gel. I got this shampoo and the conditioner (off another site).It gets my hair clean I guess.I don't think I would spend the money on it. It's expensive for what it is. It's not anything special..
3,"Good shampoo, but don't believe the hype","I've used this for several months and overall it's a good product. Smells really nice, makes the scalp tingle and leaves hair clean but not dry. The implication that it will help with thinning hair is pretty much BS and I don't really know how you would measure if it's ""strengthening"" your hair."
4,Drama,"Thanks, it was what I expected and the arrival time was great! If I had to buy again I would buy it from you!"
3,Ghost Stories of Edith Wharton,"i thuoght Gost Stories by Edith Wharton was very good, old fashioned stories.Some of the endings of stories seem to run out of steam. i did enjoy the book, and intend to read it again.."
2,"Couldn't scare a mouse, much less a Rabbit.","Although I respect and enjoy Edith Wharton's other writings (""The Custom of the Country"", ""The Age of Innocence"") I was terribly disapponted with this collection of ghost stories. They simply are not scary (unless for instance, you find wisp-like writing supposedly written by a ghost communicating something the reader never learns to be frightening). If you are looking for well written stories in Wharton's style and don't care about a 'scare factor', I suppose you could spring for these. If you are looking for the slightest bit of chill down your vertebrae, move along, move along. This didn't ruffle a single hair on my body, nor a whisker on my face. Two stars for the writer's sophisticated word craft but I'm afraid zero stars for the ability to truly chill the reader (which, after all, is what we ghost-junkies crave).Wind In Hare"
2,Are ya listenin'?,"The instrumentation of HI FI has potential and showed promise, but only know one speed: (too)Fast. Unfortunately HI FI's lead singer(?) cannot carry a tune(just listen to samples). He is consistently off-key and proof the rest of the band is tone deaf(their instruments sound out of tune also). Get him away from the mike!"
3,Cute but...,"This ring is comfortable and looks good in but the problem is when the top ball is screwed on all the way, the attachment for the charm is actually on the back of the ball, close to my stomach. The charm hangs off to the side slightly. It wasn't so bad that I wanted to return it but I found it pretty annoying. If you turn the charm like a quarter of the way so the attachment faces down like in the picture, the ball becomes too lose and falls off easily. This might have just been a problem with mine like a defect or something. Also the bottom ball is fixed and won't come off."
3,"Construction of wooden buildings, wharves and bridges","This guide has 28 pages about building wooden bridges and wharves. Otherwise, it's about wooden buildings. It starts with reading construction blueprints and making bills of materials and describes the entire carpentry process, literally from the ground up.Its prose is very dry and it's divided into numbered sections that make abrupt transitions from topic to topic. There are many useful line drawings that explain the construction process, but no photographs."
5,A must read for all interested in the early church,"This book is fantastic. I ordered it as a backup book in case I needed something to read on the side, but I quickly found that I couldn't put it down. This book is great!It starts off with a quick overview of the 31 largest cities in the Roman empire, which includes the origin, population, and demise of each city. Stark then goes on throughout the book to summarize hypotheses around where major religious movements were in the first few centuries. For example, he comes to the conclusion that major port cities were the first to harbor churches, and also that cities with major Jewish Diaspora communities were the first to have churches. He also gets into Gnostic origins and pagan religions.This book is pure gold. I will be referencing it for God knows how long."
2,Beware of Kindle edition,"The book itself is the kind of first-rate scholarship and engaging prose that readers have come to expect from this author, but the maps (crucial to grasping the argument itself) are miniaturized and turned 90 degrees to fit on the page of the Kindle edition. And if the Kindle is turned horizontally, they remain at 90 degrees. The superscripts are also not linked to the footnotes. In short, a shoddy job of rendering this for the Kindle. Go for the print copy, unless these things don't bother you."
5,Must read for anyone interested in Church History,"If there is only one book on Christian History that you can read by Rodney Stark, this is the one. In it he includes a good summary of original research he conducted examining the Christianization of ancient cities of the Roman Empire. The research uses statistical analysis on historical data to test commonly held views. In most cases, the research confirms what more mainstream historical research has found, but in some cases the results show surprising differences. It the process, he shows how Christianity spread and illuminates many of the conditions that made the spread of Christianity possible."
5,snapcase=better than your favorite hardcore band,"one of my all time favorite albums. catchy guitars, meaningful lyrics without being too blunt or chock full of metaphors. this is what hardcore should sound like, not hatebreed & madball. granted snapcase have changed their sound but it certaintly hasn't been for the worst. anything this band has done & will do will be gold, no matter how many idiots in jersey's & bandana's cry sell-out. granted the vocals are a bit on the monotone side, it doesn't matter, why? because it's snapcase. like my title says snapcase is better than your favorite hardcore band."
5,"Terry, you are a total star!!","I have been swimming the Breast stroke for 10 years, it turns out that my stroke was very inefficient. Seeing Terry's video and implementing his technique has improved my speed by at least 50%. Terry is a rock star!! I can't recommend this video enough."
1,"For retirees, not for serious professional track","When I ordered swimming instructions, I expected a pro to show the best muscle movement. My kids may or may not participate Olympics when they grow up, but they'll learn the professional movements in any sport they try. The cover uses a pro as an enticement. The guy in the video is actually no Michael Phelps, but a round belly polar bear, whose postures are in every ways against fluid dynamics. Please, mark your DVD in the appropiate category: the title should say ""fun ways to swim for retirees""."
2,disapointed,"I thought I was getting new music,turned out to be three of her older albums that I already own.disapointed because I wasted the money.Still love her music though."
5,learn something,"if you're looking for a glimpse of the hardcore scene in the mid to late 90's, this is it.devour this.joshua*"
3,"Utilitarian, but useful","This is a shirt pocket size book. It definitely will NOT teach you to speak Spanish. If this was your only resource, it would be only a little better than pointing and gesturing. It will be most useful if you already know some Spanish, but can't find the words commonly used in construction in your English/Spanish dictionary, and you typically cannot. The terms are mostly for mechanical construction. It doesn't have many specialty terms like ""screed"" or ""splice"". But, for the cost, it is definitely worth having if you are working with hispanohablantes."
1,Construction Spanish/,"Ok- for other constrction parts- but it is not great for the ""pre-engineered steel buildings and homes"" where I am at. It does not have any of the words that we use daily in our industry."
4,good value for the price,"it's not fancy, but it's exactly what it says it will be. if you want a small, pocket sized dictionary with all of the construction words, this will work fine"
1,Not What It Says,"I guess I should've took a quick listen to the samples, but this was not Redd Foxx. This was an album with music instead and was very disappointed. Luckily, Amazon was good about refunding my money."
3,"Enjoyable, but not as infuential a film as author believes","This was one of the first making of a moive book I had read (Picture by Lillian Ross was the first) and I was pleased to find it again. It's a fun chatty read that tells you all you need to know about GWTW. At times it almost tells you too much, especially if you have not seen the picture because it does contain many spoilers. However, it does have on incredible howler. The book came out in the early seventies and at one point it compares GWTW to a then current movie enjoying incredible critical and popular acclaim. Lambert however wonders if it that film is only a flash in the pan and doesn't think it will have the same impact thirty years on that GWTW has. The movie he compares to GWTW: The Godfather."
1,just the facts please,"I have been a fan of Mable Mercer since i saw her perform at the Downstairs at the Upstairs in NYC in 1961. I jumped at the chance to buy this book, wanting to know more about her. I managed to plow thru it since I was really interested in knowing about her life - but it sure was a chore to do so. This is perhaps the worst written book I have ever read. Redundant, terrible uncalled for puns - you name it. If you are a fan, do read it - her life story is there. But be prepared for a tortureous journey.I would have given minus stars, but that didn't seem to be an option."
1,Not a Fake Review,"It's clear (no pun intended) that I am the only non-Scientologist to review this book. It is not even good fiction. There is no pretense of any scientific research or reliance on 'hard fact'. The author simply weaves a story from imagined facts and childlike observations. These banalities are stated forcefully, though, as 'facts'. As you might imagine, some of it resonates with lonely persons who may have self-esteem issues and need some fantasy of this sort to identify with. Many parts of it are ludricous to an uncommon degree. Imagine your own school-aged child writing any chapter and if you would not be moved to at least consider counseling, your child is in some peril."
1,hello!!! what happened here???,"Ok lets get right to the point veary chingon movie, lots of action good gangster s*** but this!!! I mean wheres the firme musica??? You would think with such a great movie the soundtrack to the movie would be so bueno but it just doesent grab my attention at all. I mean some of the songs are good like the one bye Funkadoobiest and Girls It Aint Easy bye the 4 Corners and the one bye Boss Catch Hit and Run but on these songs they are a different version of the songs not the ones like the way they were in the movie and they left some good songs out for instence, the one So Ruff so Tuff by Zapp and Roger great song!!! but not on there. Well I have them already it's just the point that they left some stuff out. Well... just understand me, in what i'm saying and get somthing else like the Bound By Honor soundtrack. Now thats a good one!!! as for the 1 in rating well you figure it out."
1,wrong movie in this case,I bought the movie Kounterfeit finally get the chance to watch it the wrong movie was in the case. Check the case before you ship it to someone ecspecially if it's used.
4,Soul Food for a Blues fan,"I love this Album. From the first arrangement of ""Omaha Blues"" which sent shivers up my spine as I listened entranced to the sounds coming from the Sax to the last bonus ""Christmas Potpourri"" where I was singing along to the beat of Christmas songs in October; I knew this was truly blues. If you haven't heard the throaty blues rendition of ""Satin Doll"" by Portia Love; You must listen to this album. It is truly blues for the soul."
2,"Still has a few jewels left, but extremely tarnished","I would say that sales of this book should be left to the stores dealing in obsolete computer merchandise. Most (if not all) of the applications mentioned in this book are obsolete, having been upgraded to the point where a great deal of the advice given is no longer valid.This is not, however, to say that this book would only be useful as a boat anchor. It still has a good deal of useful information in it, and can still be quite helpful, ...My only burning question is, where ... is the 8th edition?My comment to that person who only gave it one star would be; Sure, it's the HOW TO pages. All neatly bound and printed. Do YOU want to sit down and print out all that ...? I have better things to do, and I, for one, prefer hard copy. Easier to read."
4,These guys make Dillinger look like Korn,"To describe what this album sounds like... well if Venetian Snares and Dillinger Escape Plan had an illegitamate child, this would be it. And if you've heard those sick puppies, you can still only begin to understand what a insane album this is. In a dark mixture of grindcore, avant-garde and math metal, Orthrelm have thrown away any pre-concieved convention of making music and have instead created something quite bizarre. Devoid of any melody or structure, the music is guitar and drums only, the guitars being a mish-mash of atonal shredding and the drums being pure chaos with the occasional blastbeat. I'm not going to say that this is the greatest music on the planet. I'm not going to say that this is an album everyone should hear. All I'm going to say is that if you want pure chaos, this album is what you're looking for. And for what its worth, I'd say it succeeds in whatever it was trying to do."
2,You get what you pay for,"I live in Florida where we wear flip flops everywhere, even to church. It's fine for what you pay for it, and it's comfortable, but it doesn't last. It is not solid leather. It's like some rubbery material wrapped in leather. Ok for occasional wear I guess but not for me. I've already worn them through."
1,Disappointed,For what you pay for the book it takes about an hour and 1/2 to read. Could have been more.
5,"A*TEENS ARE UPSIDE DOWN, BOUNCING OFF THE CEILING!","The artist of this CD, A*Teens, are the coolest band I know. I met them once at a concert last summer. I actually did see them perform this song live, and I was only a few feet away from them. After their performance, I met them through a fence, and took a picture with Marie (the blond girl) and Dhani (the blond guy). I truly think this would be the awesome CD, I haven't actually bought or listened to it, but if you even like the A*Teens a little, this CD is for you. Now, you may have to think if you're willing to pay this much for it, but if you don't care how much it is, and you just really want it because you're a truly devoted A*Teens fan (like me), then buy this CD! Also, if this album gets sold out and you still want it, go to www.amazon.co.uk and they have one their also."
4,Almighty Is Sooooooooo Goood!!!!,"1.Upside Down - Nice Pop Song, A*Teens Back With Fresh & Great Hit That Everyone Can Love. This Is The Original Version -4 Stars2.Almighty 7In Mix - OMG...Almighty Are So Big's, Every Time Their'e Mixs R The Best.

1,stupid ungood sweeden,hire a writer for these songs shouldn't they be rock n ' roll ? or a classic band ? work with me pepole this band is out of the game and is gonna be benched till tuesday this band is a joke and laugh out if pepole get it thumbs down you pepole are nuts but i'm not impressed sorry folks but get disney once in awhile
2,Cute enough..,"Cute song, with a catchy chorus.. Ok song for parties, but not much more. This is not the kind of song wich makes you ponder lifes mysteries, or anything at all for that matter.. Typical bubble-gum pop, but then again, that is ok once in a while... Anyway, I'm just glad to see theese guys are not butchering old Abba-classics anymore... That was just... Well, let us just say the world could have done far much better without ""The Abba Generation."""
2,Funny if you can force yourself to watch it,"This movie hurt me. It caused physical pain to watch. I took it in three batches over three days.Why did I stick it out? The dialog is hilarious. The acting is, well, they don't have any acting in this movie. The camera work is almost as absent as the acting. The people say funny things, but they say them very poorly in a poorly filmed movie.The director, first name Mister, last name Ohh-la-la, might have a future in movies. But first, he needs to learn how to direct one."
4,"Funny, yes...scary, sure...","This is an odd little film...I didn't know what to make of it at first, but ended up being really surprised at how funny it was. It's got some very inventive kills (one of them in the first 5 minutes) and the acting is really strong (you know what they say, drama is easy but comedy is hard)...all in all, it's worth watching and even owning as you'll probably want to to go back and watch it again."
1,My 10 year old could do better,"After reading all the reviews for this DVD, I thought it must be pretty good. After buying and watching, I thought the reviews had to have been written by the ""actors"" themselves. This movie is pure crap. It has NOTHING going for it. The writing, directing and acting are pure crap. I have watched bad movies before, but even the worst, was head and shoulders above this complete waste of time. Trust me on this one...words cannot describe how bad this is."
3,"Works well, but smells funky.","If you have serious digestive issues I would highly recommend taking enzymes. I did find these helpful however, this specific brand of enzymes I've had a hard time with because of the smell. It sort of reminds me of rotting meat, which actually probably makes sense since the main ingredient in this is Pancreatin, which comes from pig pancreas. When this runs out I do plan on continuing to take enzymes but hope to find some that masks the smell a little better."
4,TwinLab Super Enzyme Caps,"I assume that these digestive enzymes did the job. Hard to tell. But the formula contains HCL, which I already take separately, and I found a formula that contains more enzymes and no HCL, for a lower price. So I switched to the other brand."
5,Great for hCG Dieters!,Great product! I take 2 after every meal in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the hCG Diet and it seems to help keep the food moving out of my system as well as helping to stabilize my weight loss. I would love to know if any other hCG Dieters have also experienced this. I've lost 90 pounds so far on the hCG Diet. If you would like more information about this diet please visit my blog:[...]
2,Proceed with caution,"These did aid in digestion and prevented abdominal bloating. However, I suffered from adverse reactions/side effects from this product. It contains betaine hcl which will result in a ""warm tummy"" if you do not have a low acid stomach. I also had an adverse reaction to the pancreatic enzymes (protease-amylase-lipase). They gave me a very sore throat, minor swelling/numbness of the tongue, feeling of fullness and general feeling of toxicity. They work well for many people, but I would proceed with caution."
3,Give me bubbly tum tum,"It does not digest everything, but makes a little difference. Watch out lots of gas forms after taking this product!"
3,Believe the photo here is VERY misleading,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is not a complete liftkit, there is no description, what's in this box?"
4,Orchestral Indie Folk Rock,"The title for my review just about sums up the style of this bands music. At first I was comparing them to another Indie band called ""Pale Young Gentlemen"" but this band has a much more orchestral element to them. Imgaine, if you can, your favorite Indie/Folk band or musician and now imagine that same band using an orchestra that leans heavily on classical themes to back the Indie music and melodies...what? They're out of their dang tree!!! No, they're just Lost in the Trees.There are so many layers to their music that it's difficult to get bored listening to them.I'm a huge fans of string arrangements in music and this takes it to the next level. Think of it as Classical or Opera music for Indie fans.KEY TRACK: Ballroom Dancing"
5,Great wire,"I'm honestly not sure if it's the wire that makes that much of a difference but I wouldn't get anything less. I have it hooked up with a Klipsch 450, and it's amazing. If your going to spend $500 on the sub, don't go cheap with the wire. Get it, new or used, you won't regret it."
4,No Expiration Date,"I want to buy this item, but it will be silly for me to buy it without knowing its expiration date!!"
3,3.5 Stars,"This is worth the purchase though a lot of these tracks are old and have been on previous mixtapes. I agree about Papoose ! Son is NOT that nice. Loaded Lux and Mook Murder are 2 up and comers with a lot more versatility. All in all, this album is okay. Ill lyrics and good to mediocre beats. What more can one ask for these days ? I'd like to see 9th Wonder and Kweli put out an album. Like 9th and Jean Grae did ( Jeanius ). That would be dope !"
3,Not His Best Effort-But it's Kweli.,"Alight, I have all of Kwelis albums, and am sure he's the most underrated rapper in the game (how did Mos past him?) but beside just a few tracks, this album just sorta falls flat. It must be hard hard to consistently create sold rhymes and keep the listener interested at the same time.However there are a few gems. ""Ms. Hill"" about Lauryn Hill, ""Where You Gonna Run"" showcasing Jean Grae, ""Supreme Supreme"" Black Star together again, and ""Right About Now"" with Dave Chappele as a Rick Jamesish character, are the highlights of the album, but ""Two&Two;"" makes it all worth while. You have to own this song. A great rap song cant stand on intelligent sensitve lyrics alone, it just cant -you need good production. This song delivers, its beautiful, to be straight up. Hot sample, hot lyrics-its waaay too short. How some people can say this aint music, I dont know..."
3,He's getting back up there,"After the disappointing Beautiful Struggle, Talib gives us dope songs like ""Ms. Hill"" and ""Two & Two"". But why do rappers act like they can show us their rawness on so-called mixtapes and dumb it down on their actual albums (Jadakiss, anyone)? Overall, this set is decent but Kweli turned into another one of those good rappers who used to be dope."
2,a Cat who has blown it,"there was a time when Talib Kweli was the cat like the Street Ball Legends on the Basketball court that Cats in the Pros worried about more than most of the cats they were facing night in&night out. indeed Talib Kweli was the Cat who couldn't get Common's numbers&was straight headed toward Gang Starr status.Taib has a vocal pressence that is known&Respected but He hasn't been able to connect with the Masses.dude over the past few years has been trying to get that hit much like that person you always see trying to get that winning scratch ticket trying to hit the Lotto but always tossing the losing tickets into the trash. well that is Talib.I still dug Him better when he&Mos Def were together.neither one has moved me much as Solo Artists.this album is just a dime a dozen for dude.this is a cat who had a chance to really drop some memorable material,but instead is barely hanging on to the Cliff Notes of a future Hip-Hop Book on the History of the Music&the People."
3,Just what the title says,"This book is no more than the title promises: a short introduction. If you want to read detailed analyses of the Greek theatre, this isn't the book for you, but if you want a book to get you started and teach you the basic vocabulary, this one is as good as any."
4,Live from Rotterdam!,"[T]his incredible bargain of a CD puts ""Please"" right into the pantheon of great live U2 numbers, and that song's segue into ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" may be the group at its most stirring -- gorgeous. The acoustic ""Staring at the Sun"" is also very fine, looser than the version on POP. The only mistake is the live ""With or Without You,"" imported from a different concert (and a different continent) -- anthemic in the worst sense. The single-edit of ""Please,"" by the way, differs from the POP original mostly in its ghostly new string arrangement."
5,I wrote a play about her in 1948.,"I'm delighted at all the attention NOW being paid to Fanny Kemble. I was in an acting class at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1948 when the teacher asked one of us to write a nineteenth century play, since there were few to choose for our acting class. So I stumbled across her name in ""All This and Heaven, Too"" and wrote a drama about her life on the plantation and all the slavery conditions. Now, I'm 81, and books are piling up about her. I got my information from a FIRST EDITION of this ""Journal"" which my grandfather had acquired soon after it appeared, around the Civil War. It kept England from joining the Confederate side."
3,If you enjoy history,If you enjoy history this is a good tho sad book. It needs some serious editing or re-formatting as it was sometimes difficult to read around all of the errors.
5,Well Constructed; Works Great!,The Harry Higley Wire Bender set is a superior wire bending solution that I used to easily and expertly bend piano wire for RC Aircraft conrol rods. Love the high quality machining --these will last forever. Thanks Harry!
4,Very good book,"It is a must have for those who wants to learn American idioms. It classifies the idioms into different categories, so that it is very clear for the reader."
4,This is a very good purchase,It's interesting and keeps you updated on all expressions. It is user-friendly and you can use it if you are teaching English to foreigners.
1,"IHATEPOSERS, ANTIFLAG, AND CRASS","THESE GUYS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HEARD THE SONG ""I'M NOT LOST"" AND THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD, BUT THEN I CHECKED OUT THE CD, AND IT IS TERRIBLE. BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY EVER! POSSIBLY THE WORST BAND PUNK CORE HAS EVER PUT OUT. NOT PUNK, COMMERCIAL RIFFS WITH EMO LYRICS. CRAP WOULD BE A COMPLEMENT TO THIS CD."
1,3M Foaming Cleaner,"This product is a complete waste of money. I followed the instructions (spray, scrub with damp cloth, then wipe with dry cloth) and guess what? Both clothes were pristine clean after that. There was supposed to be dirt on the cloth transferred from the car fabric! Needless to say, the car fabric and carpet remained as dirty as they were before.I have used another product in the past, and that did the job well, you could see lots of dirt on the cloth you used to wipe. Too bad I cannot remember what the brand was :("
5,Believer's Authority,This work is essential to basic Christian faith. I wish I had found it many years ago. It has clarified much for me. I recommend it to believers.
5,Anointed Revelation,"The author explains that not only do we as Christians have authority, most of us do not know about it or even how to use it. Once we are aware of this authority, we will be able to do the work God has called us to do.This is book consists of only 70 pages but each page is packed with power and scripture."
4,Good fast sevice,I have not started this book yet so it's difficult to rate it's content. It was however recommended by a relative.
1,Plaguerism at its worst,"Kenneth Hagin says its a problem that weve preached a cross religion and not a throne religion. He goes so far as to call the cross a place of defeat. How far this is from Jesus' teachings, unless we take up our cross and follw Him we are not worthy of Him, thats all Jesus preached was the cross, it was central to his teachings and His life, as well as the apostle Paul. Its already a proven fact anyway that Kenneth Hagin plaguerized this entire book from The Authority of the Believer by John A. MacMillan. One need only read both books and realize he changed little else but the title. The places in the book where the plageurism is not word for word its thought for thought. The only thing thats original about his version are his made up dreams and visitations he claims to have had from his gnostic Jesus. I wish I had more hands, Id give this book 4 thumbs down."
1,I Wonder How Much Of This Is Original?,"Before I am attacked by other reviewers, it is worth noting that I have an uncle who is on staff at Hagin's church.This book is typical Word of Faith theology, nothing more. The real problem, however, it is that it is STOLEN from its rightful author, a Christian Missionary Alliance minister named John MacMillan. This was exposed in 1983 by Oral Roberts student, Dale Simmons. Hagin then republished the book with its current title and paid ""lip service"" to MacMillan in the preface.I can't help but wonder how many conversations with God that Mr. Hagin has made up. Perhaps he really hears from God audibly, but then again, so did David Koresh."
3,The Believer's Authority,The Believer's Authority is pretty spot on with delivering a message of the power and authority over the enemy and has scripture to edify the reader. I do find a lot of repetition of the same message in every chapter. Practicing your faith is only as good as your belief in the power behind the Word of God
5,A book every Christian needs to read,This is what every Christian needs to know. This is literaly a life changing book. Unlock the revelation that too many churchs simply are not teaching. Straight from the Bible. amen!
4,"Durible, Long-lasting, Comfortable, AND Sexy!","I have been an exotic dancer for 4 years now, and these heels have a longer life than any other shoe I've purchased (Other than the 8 inch version of these heels, those are AMAZING as well!) Their stronger than most, and more comfortable than most. Perfect for the beginner, with ankle straps to keep your shoes tight to your ankle and heel (A MUST for intense dancing and long nights) and great for the advanced (Easy spinning soles, and stiletto heel for quicker spins) Perfect for any exotic dancing!"
5,Love these shoes,"I got these shoes for pole dancing classes. I haven't danced in them yet, but they are by far the most comfortable pair of heels I've worn around my house. I wear size 7.5 to 8 and got these in the 8. They fit perfectly. There is a tiny bit of extra room in the back, but the ankle strap keeps them snug. Can't wait to dance in them!"
3,Not happy with the white color,I have used black Pleaser shoes before at my job as an exotic dancer and been happy with them. I just ordered the white ones here and was disappointed to see they are not super white and do not glow in the black light like I had hoped. Im going to return them and look for the type that is bright white.
4,Good pole dancing shoes for the price.,These are my pole dancing shoes of choice. They're durable and they have an aesthetically pleasing design. It is nice that they are available in colors besides clear since clear was always boring and a little tacky looking to me (although clear does match everything:)
3,sexy but ill fitting shoe,The shoe is very sexy and well made. The problem is that the upper of the shoe seems to run larger than it should. I felt like I needed to gain weight in my feet so they would be plump enough to fill the ankle strap and toe portion of the shoe. The length of the shoe was perfectly true to size.
1,So bad,"So bad, Returns without exchange are subject to a 15% restocking fee. and You will need to pay for return postage costs."
4,Red Stripper Shoes,"I bought these for halloween last year. I wore them 2 years in a row. Very, very hard to walk in, and your toes hang out the end. But super sexy! They will make you SOOO tall!!!"
4,"Signaling that ""change is in the air""","I think that Dennis is off base and completely missed the point. Far from being ""whining"" about why Java is bad, this book actually presents a very balanced perspective on Java and its lifecycle. The message of this book is *not* that Java is bad, its that Java has come to a cross-roads in its lifecycle and the smart developer should be watching for forks in the road ahead."
4,Java is not in your future!,Great overview of where the industry is headed from a language standpoint. I've always said that Java is Complex but something like Ruby on Rails is ADVANCED! Would have like to seen CFML (i.e. ColdFusion) included as one fo the alternatives.
2,Not up to O'Reilly standards,"Bruce Tate's Beyond Java is not up to O'Reilly standards. It's poorly organized, repetitive, and error-ridden. As of the present writing (Jan. 2, 2006), the online example code promised in the front of the book is not available on the O'Reilly web site. A long list of errata is available there, however, but it's incomplete.Expect much frustration in trying to type in the main Ruby on Rails example and getting it to run successfully. And expect much hair-tearing at all the repetition and the author's attempt to be artsy by beginning each chapter by comparing white-water kayaking to the perils of picking a new programming language.This would have made a good book or special journal issue at one-quarter it's present size, with better editing, and with better testing of the example code -- and deep-sixing the tedious kayak stories."
3,No Actionable Conclusion,"The author has stretched his magazine article sized thoughts into a book. There is considerable redundancy and weakly supported opinions about the need to move beyond Java. I don't recommend this book to non-Java programmers or any managers. The author is unable to conclude with any actionable advice or timeframes. I do respect the author for posing some forward looking opinions.I did find one bit of thought provoking advice. He has made me question my opinions about ""continuation server"" web apps. That section was well worth the read."
1,Read carefully the WHOLE title- small letters first !,"The full title of this book is: ""VoIP Telephony with Asterisk- A Technical Overview of the Open Source PBX"". Deceivingly, the second part of the title ""A Technical Overview..."", is not part of the oficial title and thus, can only be seen on a picture, hardly, because of the relatively small font used. Search froogle for the title and you can see pictures of the front cover.""A Technical Overview..."" IS THE REAL TITLE ! It is really just a technical overview- not a very good one. There are bunches of options and syntaxes thrown all over, with very little or no explanation at all. May be, if the reader knew the principles of asterisk, that book could serve some purpose as a reference. Do not expect to learn something about asterisk from this book- this book is JUST AN OVERVIEW !"
3,"Disorganized, a lot of typos","This is a book where you can see niether the author or the publisher paid much attention to detail, there are a lot of errors.It does help on understanding a little about Asterisk if you are an absolute beginner, but if you managed to install an Asterisk server based on the information already avaliable in the wikipedia at voip-info.org then you dont need this book.The good thing: this is the first effort to document Asterisk for the public, there is no other good book to compare it at this moment, I hope the second edition corrects all the errors."
4,No one book can cover the entirety of Asterisk,"VoIP Telephony with Asterisk is apparently aimed at newcomers to Asterisk who value their time and want to avoid weeks of wading through the mass of disorganized material available on the web. It provides a grounding in telephony concepts that were new to me, coming as I did at Asterisk from the Linux world, and enough information on PBX configuration so that I was able to assemble a two line, three extension system of my own with goodies likevoicemail in a couple of days.No one book can cover the entirety of Asterisk, and I don't think three books would be enough. Cisco needs a lot more than that for its less functional PBX offering. I'd have like more examples in this one, but it was well worth the price."
1,Poor Editing,"This book contains little that is not already on the Asterisk Wiki and that which it does contain is poorly edited (many, many typos), badly spelled and expressed in sometimes eccentric grammar. Here's one example (page 175): ""....try recording 8 Khz, 16 bit wav files which will are likely to work better than 8 bit files"". Apart from two misprints in kHz (k for kilo is lower-case, Hertz is the name of a scientist and units named after people are capitalised), what happened to the proof-reading of the rest of the sentence? This is one of very many such examples.A good book on this subject is sorely needed but this is not it.The descriptions of SIP, H323, etc give the (surely unfounded) feeling that the author has skimmed the RFCs, gained a superficial knowledge and dumped some keywords into the book. Large portions of the book are simply listings of the various configuration files which are better described on the Asterisk Wiki."
4,"Good, but not neccesary....","THis is a great package especially if you want to play games online. You can create a game and play it online right from your xbox. ALso the mic is great. However, if you dont feel like spending 50 dollars on this kit, you can play all the multiplayer games plus more games such as halo which is not supported by live, for free using gamespy arcade. however you must have a router or hub in order to do this. If you are looking for something very easy to use and dont mind spending 50 dollars, this is by far very good. I personally feel that this is worth it mainly because in order to use gamespy, you must be at your computer, and it is very annoying to have to run between your xbox and your computer."
5,If you don't have Xbox Live...,"Xbox live is the reason i bought Xbox over PS2. All those ps2 users say its better just because of GTA 3 and because it has more games. Well guess what, there will be over 100 xbox titles by the end of 2002, and i'd rather play unreal championship online than gta any day. Sure the ps2 has online also, but does it have a headset? does it have voice masking?"
2,TRASH!,"This thing is purely trash. Oh wow xbox comes with the needed adapter to run the service, but how many people have dsl, cable, or T1 or whatever? I am sure people will pay high amount of money just to pay for high speed net connection to use xbox live. Then only to find out that their desire of high speed net connection isn't compatibale with xbox live. Then comes this whole mess of xbox promising no lag and etc cause they don't have modem adapter for people to use. I don't care if playstation 2 network adapter was broadband only as well xbox live will have lags. Why? because no matter the connection if the server is laggin the gamers themselves will feel it. Xbox live site and xbox live players can not tell you it will be lag free because of broadband only. I want real proof if that there is 0 lag in the game since its broadband only."
4,xbox live,I am a beta tester for xbox live and i would recomend the xbox live service ecspecially if you like sports games. The service had some problems in the beginning but its has become alot better as of late...it's worth [it] in my opinion.
5,Credit Card!!???,"I bought a 3 month kit of xbox live to see if I liked it;however during the sign in, it said to enter a major credit card."
2,"Good, but not worth the cash","sure, xbox live is very nice, With all the acessibilty and freedom the product gives you, but lets go into how much it used to be, This item was 50$, yes it still is, but before you woild have a free game with the package, along with the headset and cd, now you get a demo instead of the game, A DEMO, the game made the price,to prove that, lets add things up. You woul;d get a headset (Lets price that around,say 11$) adn a geame, (lets make that 39$) and the live cd, wich shouldnt cost anything because thats the service, but microsoft didn't want to lose to much money so they changed ity too a mere demo, and I close this by saying, dont write a letter to microsft if you are anoyed by this, they will only send you a recording."
1,Worst Thing EVER,"This has gotto be the worst thing ever. i just bought thinking that the subscription was part of the price like it said,WRONG. Even though it said it was free, it askes for your credit card number so it can AUTOMATICLY BILL YOU when your suscription is over! i am so mad I'm going to E-mail Microsoft and tell them what a stinky product this is. You have your info or you wont be able to sign up. Even though you can cancel it, what if you forget? Or what if you dont have a credit card? It says it in little tiny letters on the side of the box, REQUIRES MAJOR CREDIT CARD. For your sake, take my advice and DO NOT GET THIS CHEAP RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Very impressed with the Xbox LIVE Beta,"I have been a Beta tester for the last 4 weeks. I have to say, Microsoft has really gone the extra mile with this online gaming service. Although I initially had no intention of using the voice communicator, (basically because I felt like a total geek) the dynamic that voice in game adds is immeasurable in value. The Moto GP demo that LIVE will ship with is addictive and a blast! Connection to my DSL could not have been easier (plugged an ethernet cable in the Xbox, and the Xbox detected and set up the connection with no hassles), and the game lobby where you meet co-players and make new long distance friends has been great! This is the best $50.00 you could spend if you are a gamer. Yes, its that good (and this is just the Beta experience!)."
1,Does not work with AOL Broadband,"Well all the hype on the demo disks made me go out and buy this Xbox live. It looks like a pretty good product, but when I went to set it up, nope, couldnt connect. When I visited the Xbox Live website, I was informed that it will not work with AOL Broadband. I thought since I could use my playstation network adapter that AOL had also allowed Xbox Live. Guess I assumed incorrectly. The headset is a little tricky to put together, but everything seems nice. Playing the demos included with the Xbox Live disk are fun, but they are only demos. I do wish that for the cost of this, you would have gotten a full version game with it.Unfortunately, I'll be taking this back or selling it, since my pleas to AOL to allow Xbox Live are answered with ""We're aware of this situation and are working on solutions to allow this"""
3,Good for what it is.,"I suppose that this is good for what you want to do with it. The only things you're going to be able to do with this is play online...and download some small upgrades to existing games. The price you'll pay for the starter kit is a good value if you are gong to use it but be weary of upcoming bills next year when you subscription runs out. But the online service is good. There is hardly any lag and the menu is super easy. Some problems that are evident are the voice-overs, Brat is the most annoying voice on earth and should never been passed through checking. The device that hooks into your controller is a bit flimsy but not easily breakable. A good buy contrary to my previous review."
5,BEST THING THATS EVER HAPPENED TO XBOX!!!,"2 of my friends have goten into the beta (testing session before release) and i have played it at their houses. It's incredible. Its like having a party with nobody at your house. Sometimes its fun just to talk to the other people and do absolutely nothing in the game, or just fool around! Plus, if you're anti-social (don't like to talk to people) you can just unplug the headset! This is the most incredible thing that consule gaming has ever experienced."
5,Xbox Live is the Shiznit,"service launched to the public yesterday, and i just played it for the first time tonight, and it completely blew me away. very surreal at first though. i played mechassault and nfl 2k3. there is no latency at all in the video and the audio sounds more clear than a telephone. everything is seamless. definitely met some interesting people too. if you have broadband and an xbox, then headset and 1 year subscription for...is a no-brainer. if you don't have either, i would seriously consider getting broadband and an xbox. the value of being able to trash talk with strangers cannot be underestimated."
1,don't buy this for Playstation,"This game is probably fun on a computer. it's clear it was designed for use with a mouse and keyboard, NOT for use on a console (we're using a Playstation 2). My child found this game extremely frustrating to use, because it's so hard to move the cursor to the exact location on the screen as required by the game design. I think it was just a really poorly done conversion from PC game to console game. Sad, too, because my son loves Pooh so much."
4,good for 3 year olds,"A reasonably well designed set of activities with typical Disney attention to detail. Good graphics, fairly interesting games, although Eyores musical instruments can be a bit tedious to use.Some introductions to the games are a bit long winded, it pays to hit the esc key a few times to bypass the instructions and get straight to the games"
1,Old information,"I bought this book to use a guide with my supplement use, but I was very disappointed to find that this book had been written during the time of the spanish inquisition. This book is quite old, and there are many more recent studies and books that supersede what this book talks about with respect to supplements, minerals, etc.Any information and or knowledge gleaned from this book should be taken with a grain of salt."
2,"Should be an online article or pamphlet, not a hardback.","Why is it that these popular medical books usually are like cheap ice cream that's blown full of air? Sadly, not much there at all."
5,mi vida loca dvd,i placed two orders from this same seller for the same dvd and both came in very quickly in excellent condition there were no problems with making my payment or anything else thank you very much will be looking forward to ordering from you agan. i got two of the same video cuz my daughter wanted her own copy and needed one for the house also
4,Watch this movie,"I wanted to watch this movie because I am from Echo Park. I grew up there in the early eighties. This movie hit home because it portrays the life style I had, growing up. It's one of the best movies that truthfully describes what life was like in ""El barrio"". The story itself is powerful and real. I highly recommend this movie."
5,The One N Only -Gigglez,"I love this movie i can relate to it in soo many ways...thats where i got my nickname(giggles).I can really relate to Sad Girl .My friends and i all love this movie cant stop watching it..we all relate to it, like mousie,sadgirl,whisper,sleepy,ernesto,blueeyes.We enjoy it.Every one should see it because the stuff that happen do happen in real life."
5,Mi Vida Loca,this is a real good movie. better than american me in my opinion. when i first bought it i thought it would be okay but it turned out to be better than i thought. its about 2 best friends who turn on eachother after they both get pregnant by tha same drug dealer. after he dies they later realize always choose ur homegirl before any boy. tha story goes on about other events. tha only thing i didnt like about it was that i thought it ended too early. other than that this is a real good movie...
2,Echo Parque,"My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004.It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence."
4,Excelente,I always enjoyed this movie from the first time I saw it. It is worth watching over and over!
3,MOJO Dove,Great product. I tried to find one that wasn't made in China. No luck. The wire on the motor was off when I opened the box it took some doing to get it working because the motor is riveted to the body. Works great now though and I'v taken lots of doves with it. I'v even had wood ducks come to it.
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER,This is a scam. I bought this a few months ago and opened it to find that the battery container was broken and the wires are all mixed up and the product does not work. I was going to gift this to my brother who is visiting from Canada and This SCAM ruined my plans. How can you be selling products like this to people?????
1,Leaf Blower Dove,I purchased this item at the beginning of dove season. I tested it's performance in my yard for about a week and found that the wings would not spin. I rechecked the wing mounting to make sure I had assembled them correctly and I had. I siliconed the shafts to no avail. No amount of natural wind would spin the wings. I then got out my Stihl BR600 leaf blower to see if a 100 mph wind would spin the wings and amazingly the wings spun. The bottom line is if you buy this item and expect it to function as advertised you had better pack your leaf blower along with your shotgun because that is the only way you will get any action from this dead bird.
5,great quality decent price,holding up well compared to stock! all rpm products seem to have a great quality to them. would recommend !
2,"Good idea, but executed poorly.","First, let me say this: I pack freight for a living. I use a utility knife constantly at work and have for years. I also use them a lot at home. I've used most types of utility knives and owned lots.This knife was based on a great idea. The blade comes out quickly and easily, and retracts automatically. Unfortunately, it suffers from a fatal, but common flaw, namely cheap construction. It's made primarily of plastic with a bit of aluminum and steel worked in. The plastic is durable enough, but the steel catch for the door where spare blades are stored in the handle is flimsy. In regular use, the catch sometimes opens when you don't want it to. This jams up the knife, so that it won't open or close. It's easy to un-jam it, but it will happen again.Bottom line: There are better utility knives for less money."
3,I missed the Shiseido fragrance but...,"Shiseido stopped offering this wonderful fragrance a few years back and when I saw it on Amazon I was aware that it had to be an old item. My fault for ordering it. The product arrived fast and in perfect packaging condition; however, the fragrance for being old does not hold the wonderful aroma. Shiseido fragrances last all day long, and this one was totally evaporated after a couple of hours, which indicates an old perfume bottle.It's not the seller's fault; they simply stopped fabricating this perfume and I longed for it. I still recommend the seller for the prompt delivery and excellent service; I just don't recommend purchasing a perfume that is no longer in the market because the quality won't be the same."
3,Shiseido Parfum,I thought I would like the smell of this parfum but it was not what I expected. I was expecting a more soapy just out of the shower smell. This is a little too citrusy for me. The scent is not long lasting.
4,Good resource for PM development,The complete guide to Predictive and Preventive Maintenance is a good tool in the development of PM activity as part of your Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) program.
5,...,"This cleveland band is my best favorite.I think these guys Know well their way ahead.I like everthing about this album.especially, mood. -dark but realistic.-"
1,not their best work,i am an Integrity fan but this albulm is not one of their best in fact it's their worst so don't get it get something else by them
2,Behind Rebel Lines,"I didn't really like this book. I didn't really like the author's writing style, it was a little hard to understand and follow. The subject wasn't very interesting to me. I think that it would have been hard to try to re-create a story about the civil war. I think that the author did good on that.I wouldn't really recommend this book unless you are interested in things about the army. I think that it was cool though that a woman would take that kind of risk just to be in combat. Also it was cool that she was that passionate about serving her country."
1,A Preteen's Review,"I did not enjoy this book. I think if you are going to write a book like this, you should at least write it a little better. Some people may like it, but I am not one of those people. It was confusing who she was trying to help."
5,Great classroom title,"I plan to read this to my class of 5th/6th graders this year. I am constantly searching for great nonfiction for kids and this is one of them. This is a great read, interesting, great vocabulary and lends itself to discussions and projects. I highly recommend this for young readers."
2,Not what I expected for the $$,"I studied curling irons online because I had bought so many locally that were disappointing. This professed to be the BEST/Professional so I expected more out of it than from the locally bought....Didn't happen. It's the same as something from Walmart, as far as I can tell - after 2 months - but I paid twice as much. It's light weight and really doesn't perform as well as one I previously purchased from Sally's Beauty Supply. Since I use it daily, they last, maybe, a year. I had big hopes for this one."
4,Too Many Men: A Novel,This is a book that is both exasperating and gripping. The central character can drive you nuts at times but you are compelled to continue reading and following her on her extraordinary saga. It stays with you. there are scenes that haunt one years after reading it.
3,long but I'm glad I read it,"Pros1) Edek, the father character, is just lovely. I finished the book because I wanted to know more about him.2) I have never considered what it must be like to be jewish and this book gave me some insight. Plus I learnt many facts about what the Nazis and Polish people did during the war which I didn't know. (Did I mention that my education was poor?)3) I liked Ruth's rudeness (however unrealistic).Cons1) Conversations with imaginary Nazi. clunk.2) A little editing wouldn't have hurt - but then there'd be less Edek!"
5,Excellent,It is too bad that Lily Brett is not better known in the US. This is an excellent easy-to-read and engaging book. I look forward to reading all of her other books.
2,Too much detail and Little story,"The book is long and full of details. Sometimes too much for a good story to flow. Brett is obsessed with both her father's past and her own. She forgets that the audience is interested in the story. A disturbing characters comes into the story who is a Nazi, this character causes confusion in the story, because one does not know if he really exists or if he is a voice from the past. I would not recommend this book."
1,Too Many Men,"Please, please find yourself a different book to read! This book is poorly written; bad literature; inadequate and offensive; I was very dissappointed."
5,PJ Unplugged...sort of,"Well, OK, not really, but these are stripped down versions of some of the songs on Rid of Me. Just goes to show that the basic entertainment is in the song itself. There are also other songs included like my favorite, ""Reeling.""Not essential to your collection, but if you're a PJ fan, you'll want it anyway."
4,Ready for some close-up?,"If you like ""Rid of Me"", then buy this CD! Although I like the polish of her final product, these demos really give you insight into her true vocal power. This stuff explodes from DEEP inside her. Uncomfortable at times. Moving."
3,PJ Harvey - 4-Track Demos,"This is a difficult, but overall rewarding record. It is a ferocious album, sometimes frightening. It is sandwiched between the utterly fierce ""Rid of Me"" and the diabolic ""To Bring You My Love"", both of which are very good records. ""4-Track Demos"" has that quality of wounded animal rage that is so typical of PJ Harvey at that time. These are only demos, but PJ Harvey tends to record on top of her demos, rather than replacing them. Some of the songs ended up on ""Rid of Me"", and it is interesting to hear the demo tracks in the finished result. Other songs have never been otherwise released -- too bad. There are some good songs here, but they really need to be finished up. I recommend this record only for fans of PJ Harvey, as it is a bit too primitive for the general public."
4,'must-have' for any PJ fan,"This record contains compositions in progress (mostly during her work on ""Rid of Me""). It's certainly interesting to hear the unpolished (and surprisingly good) versions of those familiar tracks. But the real value is the other songs. They are amazing. I have no idea why ""Drivin'"" and ""Hardly Wait"" remained unreleased until this collection. If you already own ""To Bring You My Love"", then this is your next purchase."
3,Rid of Me demos,"Personally I'm a fan of Steve Albini's production on Rid of Me. Even though the album didn't quite reach the heights of Dry, which I still consider her best album. Rid of Me was a great record and I really love listening to these demos. I think any fan of hers can appreciate them. The release was a reaction of sorts to critics of Albini's production on Rid of Me and certainly a more raw take on the material. This album is easily worth owning just for ""Hardly Wait."" It's one of her best songs and this was it's only offical release. The song didn't make it onto Rid of Me, I still don't understand why."
5,Great brew!,"I admit I'm weird because while I eat little chocolate I really enjoy this coffee. BiblioGal is correct that the chocolate flavor is intense, but I don't feel it overwhelms the coffee. Rather, while the balance is weighted to the chocolate, the coffee flavor stills comes through. I, too recommend this coffee to anyone who enjoys flavored coffees, but in particular to all those chocoholics out there. Enjoy!"
3,Good vocals and easy jazz,I enjoyed the vocals of the artist and the fresh instrumentals. It was well worth the purchase.
4,Gets to the point,"This guide gets to the point and does not confuse you like most books on the subject will. It gives you a step by step guide to writing your essay right down to the last detail. I like the detailed instructions it gives you as there is no room for error on a college essay. The chapter on outlining is very thorough and helped me get an A! I have always gotten straight A's when I used this book to help me through my essays. Sometimes you just confuse yourself by going on websites or reading through books to help you write your essay and they all say something different, or give you conflicting procedures to follow. I know it's maddening, but I recommend this book as it cuts through the bull. If you don't need cartoons to keep you focused then this book is for you!"
2,Black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...?,"I honestly don't get the appeal of these books. Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.This is particularly true of these old Doctor Strange stories, which had utterly fabulous artwork: you *think* you're reading the stories in this format, but you're really not. Not by a longshot.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books... Maybe you could buy a box of crayons to go along with all the artwork that the publishers ruined in this format. (Axton)"
4,this game sucks,"I hate this game so much. it has the worst graphics ever. Nintendo graphics are even better than this crap.1 out of 5 stars, not recommended.End of story.This should be banned from stores everywere."
4,Really cute!!!,These are really cute... love them especially for the pencil heels with the studded ball in the middle...The only thing about this is it's half a size bigger than the usual size 6. So it would have been absolutely perfect if I they had a size 5.5. Love it anyway
3,It's OK,"Ordered this because I absolutely love their coffee..but I wasn't really impressed with it..the taste is not that bad, reminds me of Kellogg's frosted flakes(but when it's been left in the milk for a while) I do feel it gives me energy(like the coffee does) its a little stronger in my opinion..it's like with the energy boost the coffee gives me is gradual & subtle..but with this cereal it's kind of like ""Bang in your face"" energy & it just seems a little to strong for me & my stomach..I'm probably not going to order this anymore & just stick to their Gano coffee..the product looks like oatmeal & 1 packet doesn't make much, may need to have some toast or fruit along with it to fill you up a bit."
2,BULKY!!,"NICE IDEA, BUT TOO BULKY. TAKES UP TOO MUCH ROOM ON ENDTABLE. LOTS OF STORAGE FOR REMOTE CONTROLS, BUT TAKES UP A LOT OF ROOM, AND IS A DUST COLLECTOR. NOT TO MENTION EXPENSIVE."
4,cooking yuck,"I bought this game for my 5 yr old after reading the reviews (espcailly the one about an autism kid liking it) and what a bore this game is!!! After you bake a cake & cook breatfast there nothing else to do (and that only takes a few mintues to complete). Yes, you can move things around in the kitchen, pour milk in a glass but what fun is that?? And Mickey & Minnie won't come and eat (only if you make a cake or breakfast they show anything else you cook just sit on the table) my son got really upset when he set the table, bake a chicken and Mickey & minnie didin't show. Plus after you pour milk in a glass, pop some pop corn there nothing left to do, my son played the game for maybe 10 minutes and did everything and now he doesn't care to play it anymore. If your kids really like to cook they'll love this game, but if your kids are not into food & cleaning up they'll get bored fast!!"
2,"TOO, Too Slow!","I bought this for my four and six year olds. My four-year old hated it. It was too slow and didn't challenge him enough. He started using the playstation recently and the first game he played with was the 'Toy Story 2'. He loves it!! This one doesn't compare to it. It's not enough for him. I'm not even going to bother letting my six year old play with it. She's too advanced for it. May be ok for tiny, tiny ones. The graphics are really cute though."
2,This game is way too slow.,"I purchased this game for my 3 year old. It was way too slow for him. My son loves Mickey and Minnie mouse but, after playing this game I do not think he likes them anymore. I will put it away and give it another try later."
3,5 Year Old Daughters Like It,"My twin 5 yr. old girls like this one. While it's not the coolest software on earth, they enjoy the fun of cooking in Mickey's kitchen. It is bright, cheerful, and engaging. It's not a must have, but it was a gift to us, and they do like it."
4,All around amazing pen -- Takes maintenance,"I'll start by saying I don't use this pen for drafting. I love to write with this pen because the lines get really dark, are extremely consistent, and the feel of writing with it is very satisfying, like a sharp pencil or a fountain pen.These pens do require you to keep it at a roughly 80-90 degree angle to maintain ink flow, but I don't mind that.I also don't like to use the Koh-I-Noor Technical Pen Ink. It clogs the pen quickly and regularly. Black India Fountain Pen Ink almost never clogs it, and is still very dark and doesn't soak through paper.With minor maintenance and the right ink, this pen will last you forever."
1,Warning: This is NOT the original version,"Don't buy this book expecting a reprinting of the original 1978 Choose Your Own Adventure book. The text has been revised, though the revision is serviceable enough; but what's worse is that all of the illustrations have been replaced with hideously bad cartoons. Words cannot even express how amateurish and badly drawn some of these cartoons are, and they're on nearly every page, so it's impossible to ignore them. Buy a used copy of the original book, or choose something else to read."
4,Good books,My kids have loved these books and have read them every night! My 12 yr old daughters teacher has been asking people in her class for anyone whos read them and is excited to read them himself! Thank You!
4,Every Woman Should Read,"I knew that men and women are different but this book opened my eyes to just how far off the mark I was when it came to communicating with a man. My relationship has gone from strength to strength simply because I changed the way I get my point across and ditched my preconceived ideas about why men act the way they do. They are a lot less complex than we give them credit for, a very good read."
5,"Finally, a clear understanding that makes sense","I've read enough ""communications"" books to fill a library but never before have I encountered an explanation of the facts of not only the difference between men and women but the genesis of those differences. Dr. Weinberg's insight is without peer along with being honest and clear. Finally, a means to understanding that one can actually learn, internalize and utilize. Me nare not from Mars. They're human. That understanding promises to do more for relationships then anything anyone has ever said before."
5,Makes Sense,"This book makes sense. It tells you the 4 reasons a man will commit that women often aren't aware of. Also, it discusses how to argue, although the book, ""The Seven Principles of Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert"" covers is best! However, this book is good at explaining why men don't/do commit, based off his research. Written for the woman's perspective. Much better than ""The Rules""! Gave me confidence by realizing men also want commitment."
3,Mundial shears,"These are just what we wanted. No plastic handles. Forged not stamped, and not made in china"
3,I Agree With Jose D. Cardona,"This album isn't bad, it's pretty good really, it's just not great. One thing that would've bumped this one up to 5 stars for me is if they'd have used the full 12"" mix's. The CD's not mixed and every track still only lasts from between 3-5 minutes, and personally I feel a little cheated when producers do that because you're not getting the whole song. It's like they want you to have to go out and buy the singles too. The DVD is pretty cool, it's got them performing 7 tracks live, and then you also get 3 really corny videos also. One of the best tracks on the DVD ""Black Snow"" isn't on the CD, that kinda erked me a little too. I got this CD as a gift, I don't know how happy I'd be had I paid $30 bucks for this though. Any way if you're a big trance fan this one has some great tracks, just don't expect greatness. Buy the singles instead"
5,As Good As The First,"The effects and fight scenes are amped up this time around, matching the impressive level of its predecessor. For instance, Trinity on that black Ducati sportbike! She RULED! Don't try that at home kids... But let's not leave Neo out. That one fight scene where Neo uses the sign post as a Bo staff and lets loose on like 100 agents at once! BAM! How about them apples? I am a big fan of the Matrix trilogy. In fact, the first one is my favorite movie. But even so, in many ways Reloaded is equally good. I recommend you get all 3 movies. They are really hot titles, and their replay value is high. Enjoy!"
1,Movie blows,"Liked the original, both story and effects. The effects have been copied since by many movies and were good in this one. But since for the 2nd and 3rd movies effects weren't going to be groundbreaking, the story had to be good. It wasn't. More confusion, contradictions and giant gaffes of incontinuity -- poorly edited, bad screenplay and just plain boring!"
5,the matrix reloaded,"hi, if you havent seen this movie, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? this film is amazing, the stunts are great, esspecially when neo saves the key maker and morpheous when the wagon explodes in slow motion. in full this is the best film ive seen this year so far (revolutions is out in november!!!)"
1,Boring,"Ok im not a stupid person because I understood this film very well I even liked the original Matrix, but reloaded is a poor excuse for a sequel. The acting is poor, the dialogue is laughable, and the only good scene in the movie is the highway scene. The fight between neo and the smiths looked really bad and fake, but even though i didn't like this movies I am still gonna go see revolutions, because I liked the original Matrix and im hoping that revolutions will not be like reloaded."
1,Matrix Overloaded,"Watching this movie was like watching someone play a videogame, which was pretty much how this movie was made. The dialogue is sillier than in most comic books - which would actually be fine if this were a parody or a spoof of the original Matrix, rather than an a sequel which this waste of perfectly good movie stock and computer cycles claims to be."
1,THE MATRIX RELOADED WITH BOREDOM,"I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. THE MOVIE IS SO BAD THAT ANYWHERE IS A GOOD START. BUT, NO, I'LL START AT THE FIGHTS. THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM AND THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE. WHY PUT ONE GUY BEATING A HUNDRED MEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND... YOU GET MY DRIFT. AND IF HE IS ABLE TO FLY, WHY SHOULD THE MOVIEMAKER MAKE HIM FIGHT. WHY NOT JUST MAKE HIM FLY AWAY!WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH! I AM GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT, I RENTED IT. I TRIED TO GET MY MONEY BACK, BUT THE VIDEO STORE INSISTED THAT ONCE I STARTED TO WATCH THIS GARBAGE... ER, MOVIE, I WAS STUCK WITH THE BILL. DARN! I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.AND BY THE WAY, TO THE REVIEWER WHO CLAIMS THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR MORONS, GET A LIFE! THIS MOVIE IS BAD! PLAIN AND SIMPLE. SHOW HOW INTELLIGENT YOU REALLY ARE AND ADMIT IT!"
1,Garbage,Don't bother with this one. The first one was great but this is terrible. See Kill Bill instead or anything else for that matter. *The freeway sequence is nowhere near as cool as the one in Bad Boys 2.
1,"Matrix, Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions...long winded....","A truly long-winded diatribe against Virtual Reality game playing....waste of 9 hours of time....the special effects are spectacular, but because of them, the script is sacrificed. Very sad, especially for those who enjoy game-playing, too preachy to be worth anything. Save your bucks."
1,pointless,"They should have just left the matrix to be a phenomenon... this sequel is pointless. a waste of money, it doesn't even have a plot, just words thatt resemble religious mumbo jumbo."
5,Loved this movie,"This plays really nice on a HD wide screen tv. I ran it on my sony 55"" lcd and it was amazing. Combine this with some nice bose speakers and you will feel like you are at the movies. the movie was very fast moving and really captures the imagination."
2,"Just watch the original three times, it'll be better","Given the success of the first film, its hardly a surprise that a sequal was on its way. Its also hardly a surprise that the second film didn't live up to the first (its a common problem for them sequels)Of course, lacking the same world introduction, and character development of the first movie, Matrix Reloaded played like a comic book, a comic book with good special effects maybe, but a comic nonetheless.No number of twists, massive explosions or psuedo-philosophy could make this movie compare to the original."
2,Pointless Action. Nothing happens after a fight scene,"While the cinematography and sound track are excellent, watching fight after fight where nobody gets hurt (stops fighting) and nobody really wins seems like a waste of time/effort."
3,What the?!,"I was blown away initially by the first episode of this film. The characters were very well done, the fight scenes, and technologies were first rate. Neo was just learning about his powers. The second film just seemed to make a mockery of this and Neo should of been able to beat hell out of just about every one. Agent smith was a bore, however Hugo weaving was great in his role I believe his talent was severely hindered by the plot. The long winded speeches and hypothesizing was extremely wasteful, if the filmakers were short of story they might have made the movie shorter instead of padding it with cr$p! To cut a long story short I just hope that revolutions redeems those who work so hard at making sense of the cr*p they are dealt."
3,"Great movie, but dvd needs more extras!!","I like many others have been waiting for the dvd version of this movie to come out. Sadly, the wachowski's skimped on the extras and instead put too much filler about tv commercials based on the movie and details about the horrible enter the matrix video game. Other than that the transfer is top notch."
2,Forget the Machines,"If all of humanity has united in the future against the machines, why are most of the humans African Americans with either close-cropped hair or dreadlocks who either self-consciously elocute hyper-standard North American English or saturate each sentence with U.S. ghetto cursing? Who wrote the script and did the casting for this film, Louis Farrakhan? Where are the Chinese or the Indians? Where are the Africans for that matter? Forget the machines: Does the future really look this bad for human ethnic integration? Is the present this ignorant?"
1,"Longest Ray Ban Commercial I Ever Saw,","Unbeleivable disappointment, where did the story go? what about the plot, why does everyone wear sunglasses 24/7? the dialog in Matrix was flawless and not one wasted line, this one is nothing but one liners that a second grader could have strung together, Link? what was that about? commander and niobi? well script writing 101 says you have got to have conflict, something for everyone sure took all the flavor out of this sequel, where is James Cameron when you need him, this sequel was dead when it started out the movie by showing the ending as the hook.two thumbs down.but the sunglasses are great looking, i want a pair that can survive getting punched in the face repeatedly."
2,Good if your looking for special effects,This movie doesn't follow any kind of logical sequence with the first movie's plot. I don't think it has a plot at all. It's true that is full of action but lacks logic. The special effects were awesome though. It's good to see it if you don't have anything else to do. I fear and wonder what revolutions might bring...
2,The Matrix- Unloaded,"This was a pretty bad movie. It might be good if I had never seen the first one, but this was just a bad movie. I just don't get how it sucked so much. It wasn't even worth watching. This movie was overrated. Same with the videogame ""Enter the Matrix"". Enter the Matrix exits the Matrix and Reloaded is unloaded. Both were horrible. I'm anxiously awaiting the third one hoping it will make this one better, but I kind of doubt it. I think it was the abrupt ending that ruined it most. If you haven't seen this movie wait until November around the time the third movie comes out to watch this one. THen it might not seem so bad, but I'm not sure."
2,Matrix Overloaded,"I went and saw this opening day, and I would have to say that I was somewhat dissapointed with it. First of all, the computer graphics they used (especially Neo flying) were rather poor. The story-ok. I had a hard time focusing on the dialogue since every encounter was a 15 minute conversation that was monotone much like my chemistry teacher giving a lecture. I thought the keymaker was a weak character. I did not like the way Trinity was made to seem weak when in the first Matrix she was a really strong character. This movie was way too hyped up and did not live up to the expectations I had. Maybe the third one will be better."
5,Follow the white rabbit.......,"OBVIOUSLY, NOBODY CAN BEAT THE ORIGINAL MATRIX. THE ORIGINAL WAS A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. THE MATRIX RELOADED IS GREAT. THE STORY IS AWESOME. IT IS WORTH SEEING 2,3,4, TIMES ...IT IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE. I GAVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT STILL KEPT IT'S ORIGINALITY AND THE STUNTS ARE STILL JAW DROPPING! I CAN'T BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE STORY. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST TRILOGY OF THE CENTURY!"
3,A little disappointing....,"After seeing the matrix, I wasn't too impressed by this sequel. It seems a law of nature, sequels are rarely as good as the first. There was okay action but it dragged. There was too much religous symbols and statements. It's not a very good thing to put in because people have been watching the matrix endlessly and are going to drowning under all the religous symbolence the 2nd movie makes you go through. This was not a good idea, because this is too sudden a turn and a too sharp one. This simply loses the people who came there to watch an exciting sci-fi/action/adventure movie."
1,What Happened?,"The first Matrix Movie tops my list of favorites, the second was done well enough to keep me waiting for the final. When I saw the the final, one time, I walked away thinking what a waste! I have both of the first two movies on DVD and will not be completing the set. This last ""movie"" was just STUPID! What where you guys thinking? With an established cast and foundation for greatness, there was potential to knock one out of the park. I would rather have teeth pulled than watch this disaster again. What a waste, so sad, such potential. *sigh*"
3,It's gotten too far-fetched,"As most will agree, the first movie was the better of the two. The fight scenes here happen simply for the ability to show off the effects."
3,I GUESS IT WAS OK,"THIS TIME, NEO, MORPHEUS, AND TRINITY MUST STOP THE MACHINES FROM INVADING AND DESTROYING THE CITY OF ZION. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE STILL GOOD, BUT IT'S JUST THAT, WELL, THEY PUT A LOTTA POINTLESS STUFF INTO THIS SEQUEL. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS ENTIRE MOVIE IS BY FAR THE CLIMATIC CHASE SCENE. BUT, JUST LIKE A LOT OF OTHER SEQUELS, IT'S JUST MISSING SOMETHING THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE SO GOOD. BUT STILL, THIS AIN'T THAT BAD OF A MOVIE. ''THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS'', WHICH IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATRIX SERIES, WILL HIT THEATRES NEXT MONTH."
2,KACHING!...,...that's the sound of selling out. Got the second star because I stayed awake and didn't vomit.
1,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the first one a great deal, and lined up on opening night to see the second. It was...boring. Yes, there were some cool action sequences, but even those managed to go on too long, and the rest of it...talk, talk, talk, dance, dance, dance...yawn. This was a movie badly in need of an editor. Actually, it felt like half a movie trying to be a whole movie via lots of padding. Maybe if they'd tried to make Reloaded and Revolutions as one movie this one wouldn't have felt so...empty. Don't waste your money."
1,Title is misleading...,"When I found out they were making a film called ""THE MATRIX"" I went nuts...but this isnt what I expected. The REAL TRUE MATRIX is what makes Optimus Prime a hero, and is what he gave to Hot Rod so he could become RODIMUS PRIME after his untimely death. I didnt see one Autobot or Decepticom in this movie."
1,Too little plot; too much action.,I agree with those who were disappointed with Matrix Reloaded and its lack of plot. I didn't expect to like the original but I really did. I did expect to like this sequel and I really didn't. Matrix had a message. It was inventive and captured the imagination. Reloaded retained none of the original spark. All I can remember about it is agents multiplying and machines marching to take over. Will the machines conquer all in the end? I seriously doubt it. I also doubt that I will bother to find out.
3,May become the key part of the trilogy,"When I first saw Reloaded I was disappointed because of the sudden change in the roles of the characters. But after watching the movie the second time I saw more into the plot, the scene with the Oracle is the key. I agree with most that the plot was ambiguous with all the philosophical psychobabble but the arguments of deterministic nature and free will, will come full circle in Revolutions because they go hand in hand. But they did their job with the cliffhanger. Wether you like the movie or not you will watch Revolutions if you are a die hard Matrix fan."
1,If I could I'd give it zero stars.,"I hated this movie beyond all reason, I don't even know where to start in describing it's utmost stupidity. First of all almost all of the dialog in it was pointless rambling, which had nothing to do with anything. the relationship between Neo (who now is seemingly ""superman"") and Trinity (the ugly man-woman) is extremely corny. The world of men- Zion, which I had pictured in my mind to be a sophisticated and futuristic haven, turned out to be nothing more then a hole in the ground filled dancing cavemen, it was horrible. It's was not at all like the original Matrix, which broke boundaries of what is real and what is not. the whole point of this movie, the only goal was to get through a stupid door."
2,sunglasses anyone?,"What is with all the sunglasses? This movie is nothing more than a showcase for martial arts, special 360 degree effects, and... sunglasses."
2,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!,"on the first minutes of the movie, I thought I would die of major boring sindrome! the jump of trinity is ridiculous!! and their faces! ""we are very bad and we wear sunglasses all the time"" matrix is completely ridiculous..the first movie was ok! they were in the matrix a couple of times, fought the agents, great fights, excelent..but this one is completely EXAGERATED!! why is neo fighting about 100 agents if he can fly like he does in the end ? who is he now? superman ? what is that dance in the beginning ? sex on a movie like matrix? it's like putting sex on star wars or lord of the rings...MY MONEY BACK NOW!!!!!!! cheers!"
1,Oh me ...,"Ok, I'll make this short and sweet. I swore I wouldn't judge this movie before part 3. Now that it's all over, I have to say that in retrospect, Reloaded is even more use- and senseless than I thought it would be."
2,slow slow slow,"This movie was boring, very slow and should have never been made the frist Matrix was great but this junk was only made for the all mighty buck so dont give up yours for this junk the only thing good about this dvd it that it's widescreen."
3,Still a visual triumph!!,"Given the fact that the movie had the dialogue of a bad Shakespeare play, the film still works as a visual treat. I just don't like the screenplay. The movie takes itself too seriously. Despite it's short comings, the special effects are just incredible and is still worth the price!!"
3,Poor Audio Mastering,"While everyone has their own thoughts on the movie, the one thing that everyone will find aggrevating is the audio on this DVD. All of the speech is 1/2 the volume as the SFX and Music, so either you are being blasted by bangs, booms, and punches, or you can't hear anyone speak."
2,pure hype!! I hope you learned your lesson watching this....,"It seems the second movie of the matrix failed in a very big way that the movie even managed to get their fans the the theater becuase of how much hype it had and all the dissapointment that comes with it, now you learned your lesson that things are not what they seem. First of all the movie fails in poorly directed fight scenes and in a complicated plot or poorly done script, In fact i was finding the movie boring to watch except the big chase scene which was probably the most exciting part of the movie, besides this the movie is just a filler between the first and third movies.And its sad but true if the movie did not have special effects i'd give it 1 star."
1,Awful sequel,"This was an awful sequel to the original matrix. Who ever wrote this sequel is an idiot. Do not buy. Most of dialog does not make sense, their was way too much slow-downs and fightings, and their was not much of a story dialog. Do not let your teen watch this sequel."
1,One great big YAWN...,"Sorry, but this movie was ANNOYING. The fight and chase scenes were excessive and got boring after a while (the highway chase might be an exception). Orpheus'--er, I mean Morpheus'--""prophesizing"" was dull. I skipped over the Zion Orgy/Keanu's Butt scene--ick. The plot (as other reviewers have mentioned) was nonexistent. Most of the minor characters, especially Persephone and her husband (name?), were really, REALLY annoying.The only thing I liked on this entire DVD was the ""behind the scenes"" look at the highway chase. Not worth the money."
2,Ugh....this is bad............,"Way too many comical fight scenes. Terrible story. There seemed to be way too many cookie cutter scenes, influenced from various sources, such as; The Warriors, Close Encounters, The Warriors, Chips, Star Wars, and a J-Lo video.This film really needed an editor, some of the dialogue just drags on and on and on....The first movie was very good, but please, for your own sake, skip this one."
1,Mistake,"The first movie was watchable, this was a two hour very bad advertisement for the third movie."
2,Disappointing to say the least!,"While the special effects are stunning, the movie itself was a huge letdown. This is after going in with low expectations to begin with."
3,See it for action. Nothing else.,"Im giving this movie 3 stars because the action scenes are beautifully done and are pretty over the top. Kudos on that.However, the other scenes just drag on and on. The scene with the architect, Morpheus speech, and Zion love scene are especially horrendous.And for all the people who think thats theres this extra hidden deep profound philosophical mumbo jumbo, get real. These movies are not worth the time or mental energy to even try to find a deeper meaning. A pure action popcorn movie and thats it.And the confusing storylines probably have to do with the Wachowski brothers starting the movies as males and at the end of the trilogy one is now a female."
3,ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: special-effects; styleLowpoints: plot; actingConclusion: It's as simple as it gets - I found the original Matrix way too overrated (Tarkovsky exploited those themes visually long before the Wachowskis), but also way above average in terms of Hollywood fare. The second part is just the same for me - good special effects (just fun to watch, rather fake-looking actually, except the 40-minute race and Neo flying), good style, bad plot (been there, done that) and wooden acting. Fishburne runs through the religious routine as Morpheus, Carrie-Ann Moss is blank and a tool for wires as Trinity, and Neo is wandering from one plot point to the other like a puppet.Hell, this is all right though, maybe too pretentious and long, but definitely worth $10. Just to see the rest of the world catch on and be disappointed.The Matrix really isn't that special, people. Watch Wachowski's earlier 'Bound' instead, now THAT'S original."
1,Reminds me of Highlander 2 (The Quickening),After suffering through the Matrix reloaded I couldn't help but be reminded of the second Highlander movie.Highlander 2 (the Quickening) was not only a bad movie in its own right but managed to completely alter the way I felt about the first instalment. All mystery had been explained away with a cheesy sci-fi plot (something about planet Zargon?).The comparison may be a little unfair on the Matrix but at least Highlander 2 didn't drag on for hours.The original Matrix (like Highlander) was a great movie that should have remained sequel free.
2,Terrible philosophy...,"Matrix Reloaded was packed full of action, suspense, and incredible fight scenes. However, the mere brute force of this movie was not enough to save it from being a philosophical letdown from the Watchowski brothers. The entire ""cause and effect"" idea expressed by our French friend was nothing remotely surprising or interesting and only leaves the viewer waiting for a more in depth idea that never surfaces. Not to mention any usage of philosophical dialogue is totally ruined by a blatent explanation directly following, but hey, he ""drank zee wine"" and now he ""must piss."" Is Reloaded worth having in a movie library? Yes. Does that necessarily mean that it was a successful continuation of an incredible plot and idea? No. On the plus side, the action scenes are incredible."
4,Buy it if you like mysticism mixed with action,"I am most likely not going to pursuade anyone who has not liked the Matrix sequels to like them. However, it is interesting to see such polarizing effect from Reloaded and now Revolutions. I personally enjoyed both. The films played out the idea of a few humans struggling against a machine dominated world nicely. It is definitely not a Hollywood happy ending sort of series. Reloaded can be ponderous at times but if it is at fault being pretentious, it is at least thought provoking---hence such extreme feelings. I think people who are disappointed with the sequels simply want to have a nice and coherent explaination and resolution of the story. Reloaded doesn't provide that; in fact, it turns what is learned in the original movie upside down by revealing just how much the machines are in control. If one can deal with that disappointment and is not expecting a tidy Hollywood ending, it is a very satisfying film."
3,IT'S....OKAY,"Matrix Reloaded? Well about all that the reloading seems to involve here is introducing the audience to a couple of new characters, giving Neo some more powers, throwing in some kick-ass action scene, notes from philosphy 101, and have it all lined up for M.Revolutions. thats about all thats here folks. Its pretty obvious all the Wachowski's cared about was creating a enough special effects to wow people into theatres instead of actually taking this movie somewhere. But i'd watch it again cause it does make a good action movie."
2,wow fx blah script,The bros. obviously spent too much focus on fx and not enough on script. Caye needs to watch a real movie and see what a wonderful balanced combination of fx AND script can do. Being in the buxiness I can say that a lot of reviewers here are correct in their thinking.The restarting of the heart did not need to be there nor did the overly graphic content of the dance and sex scene. All of those could have been done more tastefully. The plot was quite thin. I would have given this a lower rating but for the fact that I really enjoyed the scene where Smith decided he needed more copies. The presence of Smith greatly added to the movie and I can hardly wait to see more of him. Yes.... I hope the next movie has more script to go with the FX. Then... and only then will it truly be a good movie. A movie is nothing without a good script.
5,Disc One review,"On disc one of The Matrix Reloaded you get pretty much just the movie. All the extras are included on disc two which I will have to wait to see. But anyway, I have seen the video and heard the sound quality of this movie and it is phenomenal. The video is perfectly clean of artifacts. The sound will simply blow you away. If you were impressed with the audio from the first Matrix DVD, then you have to hear the sound on this one. Get this DVD when it comes out.Video: ASound: A+Menus: B+Rated R for violence, some language and a scene of sexuality"
1,A 2-hour spot for a videogame.,"I'm really fond on the original Matrix movie and now I seriously doubt if I'll take the chance to waste another 2 hours watching Matrix Revolutions.First thing with Matrix Reloaded is the utter lack of script or plot. Producers and director tried to fill in this void by exposing the audience to never-ending shots of overwhelming special FX. The result is a dull movie that has no traces of the creativity displayed on the original Matrix where plot and visual FX were wisely combined. This time characters are flat and unbelieveble so we don't care for what happens to them.Let's hope that Matrix Revolutions will leave a better taste in our mouths.Don't waste your money in this DVD, buy a ""real movie"" instead for this is nothing but a 2-hour long trailer for the videogame (which by the way I'm sure will be much more interesting)"
1,Matrix disappoints,"Neo is as stiff as cardboard, some of the other characters were ---- ridiculously cast as people from the future. Too much pointless babble, French guy and the Twins were great, but the other characters were exceptionall weak. Don't even get me started on Zion.....what a joke."
2,Blah! Blah! Blah!,"Have the standards of Hollywood filmmaking dropped so far as to allow a movie this poorly made to crack the $100 million mark? Apparently. There is entirely too much dialogue in this installment, and most of the visual effects ""look"" computer generated. What was so fresh in the first film comes across stagnant here. There are a few CGI moments of note, but most look like I'm watching some kid playing a video game. The acting is sub-par as well. Compared to ""The Matrix,"" ""The Matrix:Reloaded"" simply reeks. The ending is like a cheesy Sci-fi original movie teaser to try and get the viewers to return for the finale. I, for one, will not."
4,Why Doesn't Warner Bros Get It?,They did not do the sound track on the first Matrix in DTS 5.1 sound and it is weak! Now they are going to do the same thing again with the sequal. All of the money spent on sound for the movie but yet when it goes to DVD they will not invest in DTS. The sound should always be neck and neck with the picture quality. It is sad.
2,Unfortunately Disappointing,"I am a huge fan, I saw the Matrix 3 times in the movies and bought the DVD the day it came out. I have been waiting 3 years for the sequel as many of you have. Here is the sad fact: If this was the first movie, there would be no sequel. The only reason for this movie is so that the studio can make this a Trilogy (so we can buy a boxed set), it is a franchise just like a Disney movie, complete with action figures and video games. I hope part 3 ties this all together but my expectations are low. I think the W brothers are great but this movie was 2.5 hours without any memorable dialogue and ridiculous psychobabble as the script. This is not a ""well its just not as good as the original"", this is a matter of; it is simply not that good a movie, great action, great cinematography but bad dialogue and plot, that we hope ties together in part 3. Yes it made $280 million dollars, I wish I could much better things about it but I am highly dissappointed."
3,see it,yes its not as good as the first but its still a good movie. if u like the first you might like this but im noy making any garenties. keanus acting is even more stiff than that of the first and this time around even the suporting cast seems a little stiff also. the new characters do absolutly nothing. but the actyion is great and the story remains solid. it gets 3 and a half stars
2,138 minutes of cat and mouse chases,"The Matrix Reloaded was 138 minutes of pure senseless, noisy cat and mouse chases. The fight scenes and the freeway car chase was too long. The slow methodical way the characters talked was boring and nerve wrecking. What was the point of everybody wearing sunglasses? The movie's action scenes were just too fantastic to believe i.e flying through the air on motorcycles, fighting over a 100 men at a time etc... Maybe I am just not a sci-fi fan. The only good thing about the movie to me was looking at Keanu Reeves."
2,Basicly garbage,"Let's face it, people. The Matrix Reloaded sucked. What was it besides a bunch of good special effects? The confusing plot made it seem deep and thoughtful, but when you really get down to it, it was just ridiculous. (You'll notice that most people who review this and think it was good can't spell and have no reason that it's good except ""The special effects were good!"")The Matrix Reloaded was just one big trailer for Matrix Conclusions. All it did was add onto the first and make people more confused. ""To be concluded""??? Why not just conclude it right now? We all know what's going to happen. It's so predictable. Save yourself the trouble and just skip to the third."
3,I thought it was good enough for a sequel,"There were aspects of this film that I was not wowed by, most people already stated the pointless Zion scene. What I won't say is that I didn't enjoy it, because I did. I'm a Matrix fan, and I'm still enthralled by the idea this movie tries to portray. So with that said, I thought it was good for what it was, the middle of a trilogy. The only thing I hope to see in the next one, which I may not, is more humanity in the characters, they were extremely wooden, and overly stoic(?)in this film. I wanted to see more animation in their expressions. The best characters were the French guy and Persimone, because they had simply - character. I still liked the movie though."
2,Poor sequel to the original,"I stopped this download rental and deleted it after about 35 minutes. I had watched the orignal Matrix the previous evening, so was in the mood for more of the same. Instead, I got a long, drawn out intro to what appeared to be a very slow paced sequel to the original - when nothing had happened at about 35 minutes into the film, I quit."
3,Lots of action,I love the look of the movie. But the scene with Mr. Smith was a bit too long for my taste making it very boring.
1,A disappointment,"After watching the Matrix through Amazon instant video, which was great by the way, we watched Matrix Reloaded. No story line, pointless sex scenes. It's like they all of a sudden realized they didn't have any sex in the first one and decided to make up for it in the second! Stupid! The fight scenes were terrible. It was nothing compared to the first one. Plus it kept freezing over and over again. We haven't finished it. I'm not sure we will. Netflix is better than Amazon in my opinion."
4,Don't listen to the negative reviews.,"Was this movie as good as the first...no. The Matrix is a movie that only comes along every 10 to 15 yrs, and blows us out of the water. If they would have tried to repeat what they did in the first, Reloaded would have been forced and alot worse. What the brothers did was take what they'd given us from the first Matrix and had fun with it. I mean, come on, a fight seen with 100 against 1. Sounds stupid on paper, but they pulled it off pretty good I think. If there had never been a first Matrix movie, this movie would still have done good by itself. I'd like to see any of these people writing bad reviews about Reloaded come up with what the brothers have given us. Say what you will but the Matrix trilogy will go down as one of the best in movie history. When my 70 yrs old grandma and grandpa have heard of the matrix, you know the word is out!"
2,random and incoherent,"this is the second movie in the Matrix saga.it chronicles thecontinuing fight of the resistance to free humanity from continuingenslavement from the machines which keep reality hidden from them.thisis not what i would call good movie.it is a collection of repetitiveand ridiculous unrealistic fight scenes,coupled with an incoherentstoryline.plus there a lot of 'profound' sayings which aren't reallyprofound at all.then you have characters speaking in riddles which aregibberish half the time.at time,i felt i was being preached aphilosophy lesson.My vote for The Matrix Reloaded is a 2/5"
2,Cool Action but Silly and Pretentious,"The first MATRIX film was interesting but I felt they held too much info back for too long. By the time you understood the story, the movie was over.By the second movie, THE MATRIX RELOADED, the filmmakers got caught up in their own pretentious premise. The dialogue just plays flat and weird. Keanu Reeves looks either deep or...blank. Couldn't tell which most of the time. The truly-odd ""Rave Scene"" was so primitive and even bestial that I wondered why humans needed to survive at all. Maybe the machines were on to something to exterminate such rampant barbarism and partying.The action scenes were very cool and the special effects extremely interesting. I'm sure the filmmakers turned to talented effects people to shoot those scenes.If only they had turned to talented sci-fi writers to flesh out their script.Needless to say, this was the last MATRIX movie I saw in a theatre."
2,bad bad bad,"The plot was horrible, the action meaningless. If you want better special effects rent an X-Box."
4,A good sequel.,"It's pretty hard to follow up on a movie as good as The Matrix, but Reloaded does a good job. Although the beginning is somewhat pointless, and seems to drag on, the movie starts getting good as soon as they leave Zion. The Matrix movies also really make you think, because a lot of things aren't explained and the possibilities of a ""real world"" is very interesting. The fact that machines have taken over the humans is also relevant to the world now, as we depend on computers ( I can't go a day without ESPN or AIM) for almost everything, and it's quite possible that we will create robots that are too smart for us. Anyway, the car chase scene is great, as is the scene when they enter the restaurant. Watch this series."
4,Not so blown away,"I was blown away when I saw the Matrix for the first time and still rank it among my favorite movies ever. I was looking forward to the sequel and again it is good.The story continues about Neo fighting in the Matrix with Morpheus and Trinity. The enemies are now more, hundreds of Smiths and a very scary albino twin. There are however too many fighting scenes and sometimes it is very obvious that computer graphics have been used, even for real people. The scene with Neo fighting hundreds of Smith is absurd.But still, the graphics are amazing, the choreography is very worthwhile and the story keeps you thinking as well. I wasn't dissapointed, not at all, so watch it if you liked the Matrix I"
2,They shouldn't have bothered,"The 2nd and 3rd Matrix films should never have been made. In fact, they can put you off the 1st if you're not careful. The best advice I had from a friend was to ignore the fact that these sequels had ever been made. You will be amazed how much more of an amazing experience it is to watch the original Matrix - which was a true classic."
2,"Matrix 2 Is Better Than The First, But Still Is Lacking","I absolutely despised the first Matrix movie! But I decided to see if the second film was any better. And yes it is better than the first, but like the first, the action along with some plot holes really don't make this movie that much more exciting.The Matrix series is a little confusing at times to follow. And I admit, the idea of these Matrix movies is great, but were handled in the wrong way. The bonus features are nice and all.Overall, the second Matrix movie still has more talk than action and falls short of my expectations once again."
1,dissapointing,"long, boring, and a plot that is very hard to understand. this movie kept dragging on and on. i just wanted it to end and when it does end we realize we have to sit through a whole new movie cause nothing really ends here. they just leave u hanging there. but this movie wasn't near as close to being as big as everyone expected"
2,A little Boring,"Ok, we have to all agree that The Matrix was one of the coolest movies we've seen but the sequel isn't as good. Looking at the trailers, we thought it might be very good but instead it wasn't. I noticed that there is too much dialogue, worth of trash. Just too much dialogue, too long dialogue, too boring dialogue, there's more dialogue then action sequences and it's boring. Reloaded isn't as good as it looks. But if your a die hard Matrix fan, you should get it, it has hours of bonus features. Watch for Revolutions which looks pretty good."
1,I would have rather stared at the wall for 2 hours,"Words can not define how bad this movie was... I wasted my time watching it, and my money to buy the DVD. If it were possible, I wouldn't even give this movie a single star. The CGI looked like something you'd expect to see in Gumby, the fights looked like something out of 'Darrin's Dance Grooves', and the plot was stupid at best. I expect that the only people who 'enjoyed' this movie were the die-hard Matrix fans who would give it 5 stars even if it was B&W with Arabic audio and Greek subtitles. If you want to get the same amount of pleasure you could expect to get from this video, while at the same time saving a few bucks, find a nice wall and stare at it for 2 hours."
2,What a letdown!! Caddyshack II was better.,"Ok, maybe not. But this was a pretty uninspiring movie. Made me want to wait till the third one comes on DVD before seeing it. The DVD doesn't have a lot of extras on it, as it may appear.Buy it used, if you buy it at all. Plus Keanu gives his best performance since Bill & Ted Excellent Adventure. He's got a big bag of nothing."
3,Blah!,"I enjoyed The Matrix--I saw it three times in the theaters. Granted, it took all three times for me to finally catch on and understand, but it intrigued me. The Matrix Reloaded just didn't have the same impact. I didn't feel sorry for anyone, I didn't want to jump in and help anyone, and I sure didn't want a Matrix-ified close-up of anything meant to be clothed (take that as you will). I felt that much of this movie was a waste of perfectly good screen time. It acted as a lame filler between the excellent first movie and satisfactory third movie.My verdict: see this movie only to catch up on what's going on in and out of the Matrix or ask a friend, but don't waste your shelf space for it."
2,"far worse than the first, not as bad as the last","gone are the ballet / dance-like fight scenes, replaced with loud explosions and sophomoric dialog -'what do you want?' ""I want the same thing you want - everything."" An abrupt cliff hanger ending, continuity errors, and overly long and frankly dull fight sequences. The characters are more interested in hearing themselves talk than taking action - Morpheus becomes a bore, and Neo becomes Steve Reeves as Superman - only the music is different.You'll want to see this because the first movie was truly an act of genius, but the directors cut of this movie should be about 35 minutes long."
4,Reloaded Succeds.,Despite all the negative reviews I think the movie was quite amazing. It may not be as story driven as the first one but the action sequences are a lot more eloaborate then it's predecessor. Viewing the movie multiple times helped me understand what this chapter was all about and the conclusion as we all know by now will be resolved in the revolutions. Still I think the movie was teriffic and I give it 4 stars out of 5.
1,Ugh...very disappointed,The movie was too drawn out and boring. The love scenes between Neo and his girlfriend was cheesy. Once they played up the romance angle it degraded the quality of the movie.So now Neo is a superhero. What's so great about that? How boring!'The Matrix' was definitely original in its concept and special effects. It played a big part in its popularity at the time. There was nothing original about 'Matrix Reloaded'. It was just more of the same and the scenes were too long. Was hoping it would awe us with a better storyline and special effects.Probably wouldn't waste the time or money to see Matrix III if they dare to produce one.
1,crud,"This film is really really boring and only has one thing good about it! That being the 14 min car chase, and that's it! Bad..."
2,Very weak sequel. Do not enter the Matrix,"This movie is a perfect example of the product of the greed of movie producers. The plot is weak, the action scenes are forced into the movie, there is nothing new and even the acting is mediocre. I consider the first movie to be the best action/sci-fi movie ever, but wouldn't even think of buying this one."
2,Poor sequel,The first matrix was brilliant.Like most sequels this one falls far short.There is no more storytelling; just a rehash and fight scenes.
5,Sequel outdoes the original!!,"Thanks for reading.This is one of those rare films that outdoes the original- just!The story deepens, the amazing effects, costumes and sets are there, and in the end this movie poses more questions than it answers.It leaves you hanging at the end, where you think... What the? What could....? What if....?Sadly, I have seen the last film and it was a dissapointment. But, I prefer to watch this one, and then make up my own 3rd film in my head with my own ideas!Easy to get lost in this movie- and forget about what's going on around you.Another great Sci-Fi film that really is a must see for all action, sci-fi , Police or martial arts buffs."
4,Not bad,"Talking about the movie, the first one was quite a bit better. I would still recommend it though, just because it is better than many of the movies out there. Its a good dvd copy."
1,JUST WHAT IS IT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT ????,It is hard to like a movie in which the characters go on and on with incomprehensible (I hope that's how you spell it) dialogue. It's hard to like a movie with the least appealling leading lady in history. It's hart to like a movie in which every character wears sunglasses in the darkest of enviroments. It's hard to like to a movie in which the hero suddenly discovers he can (inexplicably) fly.
4,Seraph and Neo,"Is seraph a pointless charcter? is neo and Seraph fight poinless?NOWhy?Beacuse the Oracle who is the mother of the matrix crated the way 99% of the humans behave, and she knows the limits of them, so seraph is designed to beat them all. But not the anomaly who is different from the rest. So one software (the oracles) crates a program like a defense for bad humans and other software.Why seraph can't beat Neo, because he is an anomaly, the oracle doesn't fully understands him.Every time you watch the movie it keeps getting better."
5,The scene nobody likes..,I've read a lot on the writhing sex Zion scene where everyone is dancing and NEO and Trinity get it on. Why is it so long? Why all the dancing? Man do they have to hit you over the head...look at what Trinity and Neo are doing. Look at the people who are dancing. I think the scene has more to offer than meets the eye. They are releasing these movies so close to one another for a reason. Just wait for Revolutions.
4,MALCONTENT AND BITTER REVIEWERS SUCK!,"I just want to say that RELOADED was a very entertaining second act of the trilogy. It makes me sick to read all of the reviews of the ""movie experts"" out there who want to bash this film. I would really love to see some of these losers try to direct or write their own version to the movie under the incredible pressure that the Bros. were under for this one. It would be pathetic and laughable. Yes, there were obvious problems with the movie, but overall it was a very cerebral story that isn't finished with some mind-blowing action scenes. A very good bridge to the conclusion REVOLUTIONS later this year. I can't wait to see it and I'm sure I'll see all of the cry babies who bashed this movie there too, loving every minute of it. ..."
2,Matrix Regurgitated,"Reloaded opens with an explosion and karate, one of many problems with it. It tries too hard to outdo the first flick and ends up looking dull. It did not help that I saw the original Matrix umpteenth times in TV reruns, so I was tired at seeing more slo-mo karate. Another problem is Reloaded attempts to seem profound with nonsense dialogue:""Why are you fighting the machines?""""Because I choose to.""(Deep silence.)So many unanswered questions: Why did people within the Matrix look exactly like themselves outside of it when they never saw themselves to begin with?Why didn't Smith download himself a million times into human hosts like the first guy and rage on?"
2,"Visualy stuning, but what the hell is going on here?","I loved the first flim. It was origenal, fast-paced, and just plain cool. I saw ""Relaoded"" a few days after it's thactrical release. I was confused, really confused. I was compleatly lost throughout the entire movie.The fight sceans are better then they were in the first movie. The highway sceen is the best action sequence in the history of cinama.November came around, and I hoped ""Revolutions"" would clear things up. It did'nt. Someone please explain this weird ass trilagy to me."
2,Oh... stop COMPLAINING SO DAM MUCH,"This film is waaaaay too talky than the original... some effects were cool, but whassup with the story?"
4,Action packed adventure,"The Matrix is back, with a new thriller packed with action and surprise. The Matrix movie has many of the same characters we recognize. The plot is thicker, more intense, and a little more confusing.Acting performances are great, as are the fight scenes and ideas of the directors. Neo now has to face his destiny, and learn more about the matrix then he has ever known.The audience is thrown back into this thriller, wondering what is going to happen next, in awe at the special scenes of the movie, and in awe of the special effects.There were some scenes that were a little too long. A scene where Neo and Trinity prove their love to each other takes too long, and is one you do not want your children to see. The fight scenes were a little drawn out as well.Overall, this was a wonderful sequel to the original Matrix. It leaves you in wonder about the next movie.The Matrix Reloaded portrays what every action movie buff wants to see: a movie loaded with action packed adventure."
2,complete 360,"What's worse then the cheesy costume neo wears, is the music. That crap they play doesn't go with any fighting scenes. Big time lame! What the heck were they thinking?missed the guy who likes steak. :)The story in the first installment was kind of slow at times but very good nonetheless, the story in part two is the worst thing about the movie. period. What kind of crap was that?I can't believe the high rating people are giving this movie, it was barely watchable.sheesh!"
4,Good Sequel that does live up to the original film.,"The Matrix Reloaded is not as good as the original classic but it's a very good follow up none the least. Keanu Reeves is back as Neo, the savior of mankind against the machines and Hugo Weaving is back as his archenemy Agent Smith. This is the second movie of the series, and while it does get too involve with its post-apocalyptic philosophies, it's a pretty good follow up."
5,The Matrix Reloaded,Better Then The Last!! Read My Review On Matrix III. This Has Everything Good. Its Not As Good As The Original. The cussing is pretty bad but not as bad as 3. Theres A Pretty Bad Scene its sexual The Extreme!
1,Want to waste a few hours of your life?,"Want to waste a few hours of your life? Then here is the perfect way to do it. The Matrix is terrible, the Matrix Reloaded is even worst, and if you go to the theaters to see the third chapter in this series you should put yourself in jail. These are the worst movies I have ever seen. And if you have ever seen them you should inform the studio that produced them to destroy all the reels of film like i have done. Please done waste hours of you life like I did on these movies."
1,MATRIX-RETARDED !,"I thought this movie was like a run on sentance, to much and no meaning, was boring compared to the first one! to much time with fight scenes and the worse part was the ending, you have to watch this one to know how it ends, I guess this is how they sell a movie they make that they know might not be a hit to the public, so they have a back up the ending one. Well, I hate being led on. But anyway, im sure some people will like it, but in my opinion I could have watched just about anything else and would have been entertained.."
2,not as good as the original,"This movie suffers from ""sequelitys"".The story is complicated (the story of the first was also complicated) but that is not a problem, the problems are the following:1- The sex scene (almost 10 minutes wasted!)2- The dance/orgy scene in Zion3- The excesive use of CGI for some secuences (i prefer the Wire-Fu used in the first movie)4- Did I mention the sex scene??The plot is so-so... the story of the first was much better... i will buy this DVD only if (and just if) ""Matrix Revolutions"" is almost as good as the first"
2,This Movie Hurts My Head,"What started out as a great and imaginative idea gets totally lost in this messy sequel. This movie is best played with the volume turned off. Decent action segments here and there make it watchable but any and all dialogue should just be ignored...it makes little if any sense. This series really lost direction and seemed to become aimless, which is unfortunate because it seemed this could be a trilogy that could have stood alongside series like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but instead the second two need to be written off to still enjoy the original. It's hard to make a good sequel, when it happens it's a beautiful thing(Aliens, T2, Spiderman 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back)but more often than not, we just end up with something like Matrix Reloaded."
1,Cheesy and stupid,"I loved the originl Matrix, with it's cool FX and and the simple fact that it was just fun. There was a lot of hype on the two squels(spelling? but they were both a flunk, expecialy this oneLets start with the FX (Special Efects). They're as cheesy as they come. There is this one scene when Neo is fighting about 50 agents at a time, SOUNDS COOL, RIGHT! WRONG! For one thing, when Neo gets that pipe (or whatever it is) he jumps in the air and does this stupid twisting motion while in the typical Matrix slo-mo. It looks so stupid.Now, the sound. The sound is okay, but that one scene when Neo is fighting the Agents (as mentioned above) Neo pushes them on top of each other, but it creates a bowling sound. It sounds exactly like a ball coliding with bowling pins. Who could say laziness?You know what, there are so many bad things in the matrix reloaded that I can not put it in words. Don't waste your money on this film. Same thing with the matrix Rveloutios"
2,"All special effects, no plot.","The original matrix was excellent, and so i expected great things of this, but the sad truth is, it's just a load of guys in coats jumping about. Pretty cool, but not a good film. The extra features do have a very funny mini film thingy featuring Justin timberlake (i hate his music, but this is funny) and the effects ARE cool, so I give this 2 stars."
2,high expectations for a disappointing movie,"Let's get one thing straight. The original Matrix is phenomenal. It has plot, substance, action, romance; something for everyone.I went into the theatre hoping for the same from the new Matrix film. I have never been so disappointed in a movie. I was actually sad. Instead of vital characters, we get the albino twins, Jada Pinkett Smith, and that Italian woman. None really have any purpose. The plot? Try to save the city from the machines.The action is too much, too often. One of the best things about the original is that it knew when to quit. The worst and most useless scene is when alternating shots of Neo and Trinity having sex and half-naked writhing dancers are shown. Pointless. Tasteless. Useless. The only decent scene is with the architect.If you are willing to forgoe the plot, intelligence, and quality of the original, then this movie is for you."
3,Serious letdown,"First off, the second in a trilogy almost always sucks, since the director(s) lets the movie ""end"" in a cliffhanger instead of with an actual ending to the story. This one is no exception. Second, the DVD extras are long, boring babbles by the various people involved with the movie. I couldn't finish a single one of them. Finally, what's missing from the DVD is something that would help us better understand what is going on in the movie. Instead we hear more about what clever projects the directors are planning to get more of our money. I would have like to see bios of some of the Matrix-world characters, or maybe the scene where one of the Zion characters was liberated from the Matrix. How was Zion built? Why is Kung Fu so integral to the plot? Is it representative of some computer program/virus conflict? Sigh. No new information, just babble. There's no reason to buy the DVD if you can get the VHS cheaper."
3,a popcorn flick,"This movie is everything that a summer flick should be. Lots of action scenes and special effects. That's all I cared about and the movie is great if you like lots of action. The philosophy is not as good as it was in the first movie. It seems as if the movie was rushed and put out there to become a blockbuster hit. It was a little odd when regular people worshipped Neo as if he were god.The movie doesn't do much for me other than being a fun flick without much of a plot. Fans that are really into the movies will probably be disappointed because the storyline is more about chases, action, & special effects. It focuses less on the philosophy. Not as good as the first one. Then again most sequels are that way."
1,Disappointed but not Surprised,Unfortunately the special effects could not support the confusing and weak plot to at least make it an enjoyable movie to watch.Lets just hope there is not a Matrix 3
3,Gets better after multiple viewings,"When I first saw the Matrix Reloaded back in May... I left the theater with a feeling of 'huh?... what just happened'. I knew I had witnessed some pretty 'revolutionary' film making, and some pretty impressive set pieces, but overall, the film left me feeling unfulfilled. After viewing the DVD recently, I can safely say that I'm more satisfied with the film, and it makes a lot more sense to me. While not as earth shattering as the original or memorable, Reloaded is still much better than most of the action garbage out there today. And that Freeway scene is worth the price of admission alone. It's hard for a sequel to live up to the original, and Reloaded doesn't... but it ain't half bad."
2,Ruined by Revo,I had rated this 5 stars and said I couldn't wate for the next one. My bad... Revolutions ruined this movie. If you buy this just watch it and stay away from the conclusion and you'll appreciate it more.
4,Does what it intends to do,"Definitely a worthy sequel. As a kid, I was indoctrinated by 'The Empire Strikes Back' to accept a movie that leaves me hanging for the next installment! I agree with the reviewers here that give 'Reloaded' a good review, but I have to make a couple of additional points in response to their critique.-The feel of the series is best thought of as a graphic novel brought to life. Therefore, wearing of sunglasses indoors at night, philisophical double-speak, and over-wrought drama are to be expected and even desired! This is also the reason for the music video-like choreography. Its a style choice, not meant to be realistic.-The matrix itself is a computer program, so I would expect a hundred Smiths fighting Neo to look like a video game - it is one!I haven't seen 'Revolutions' yet, but regardless of its reviews, I will probably enjoy it just by tailoring my attitude to what the filmmakers intended."
3,Back to earth for the Wachowskis,"The Matrix Relaoded was a major disappointment when compared with the original. I loved the Matrix and I have probably watched it about 30 times. This sequal isn't bad but it is just nowhere near the quality of the original. In spite of this, it was still an exciting movie experience. There are some incredible action sequences and the layered plot is still interesting but it does begins to wear a little thin. There is a rave scene in Zion that seems especially transparent and superficial. It does not fit with the rest of the film or anything from the original. If you really enjoyed the first movie this is a good purchase, otherwise it's just another action movie."
2,A step backwards,"I first bought a DVD player years ago, right when the first Matrix film hit DVD. The Matrix DVD at the time set the standard for DVDs in the way of extras and quality. A real 5 star release. The DVD had a nice set of extras such as a feature on bullet time and a good commentary track. Sadly Reloaded is a huge step backwards from that wonderful first film's DVD.The extras on Reloaded are minimal to say the least. There is no commentary track at all. I've heard that there will be a boxed set deluxe edition somewhere down the line for all 3 Matrix films and that is why there is almost nothing on this release. If that is the case then shame on the makers of this film for putting nothing on this disc simply to try and force us to buy all 3 films on DVD a second time. Yeah, LOTR did it as well to some extent but at least folks who bought the first release of those got some good extras included on the first release."
3,Was not all that,"At first, I thought I was the only that thought the movie was not that great.The whole orgy dancing seen was a waste of time and even though the fight scenes were cool, I got to a point to where I was asking ""When is this scene gonna be over?""The special effects on the highway were superb and the overall story at least left me wanting to see Revolutions (unlike the Star Wars). Hopefully the next movie will bring it all together."
5,Matrix for the intelligent viewer,"If you had trouble understanding the first matrix movie and still dont understand it, don't see this movie. However, if you are among the elite who knows whats going on, this is a must have. Granted the Wachowski's went a little bit heavy on the german philosophy, however, the movie had a mind blowing last 1/3 of the film. The fight scenes were incredibly tight, even with some of the noticable cgi charachters that appear from time to time (especially when neo fights the 100+ agent smiths.) It also has a cliff hanger ending that rivals that of The Empire Strikes Back, or any episode of 24 if thats your cup of tea. I can't wait until this is released so I can watch it over and over again."
5,Simplemente me gusta mucho The Matrix Reloaded,Estoy enteramente satisfecho con el DVD que compre. A la pelicula no le pongo ningun pero. Simplemente me gusta mucho The Matrix Reloaded.
5,wake up!!!,"i saw this movie four nights in a row in the theatres, and every time it was better than the last. there is so much happening that it takes time to allow all of it to sink in. once it does, this movie is more than just appreciable... it is applaudible. it's kinda like waking life... either you get it or you don't... and if you don't, you laugh at things that aren't funny just to ease the tension that is building inside of you because you realize that you are totally confusaed and feel like an idiot. wake up!!! the matrix is pure genius. buy it and watch it and understand it. peace"
3,ok 3 1/2 stars,"Ok. Thats about all I have to say about this movie, the overdone special effects, the akward scenes, the zion rave, all dragged the movie down, if they had balanced out the action and the plot laying like they did in the first matrix it would have been really good, but they put in a bunch of plot laying dialoge and then expect to make up for it with a totally overdone action scene. Even though they did this it was still a decent movie. I think it mostly served the purpose and getting us ready for revolutions."
3,Left Something To Be Desired,"Honestly, I did not love this movie. I really wanted to, but I didn't. However, I don't think I hated it quite as much as many other reviewers. One thing is for sure though: it certainly didn't live up to my expectations, particularly given how much I enjoyed the first Matrix. The first one somehow managed to combine outstanding special effects with an intelligent and well-plotted storyline. This one seemed to rely too much on special effects and did not do much to drive the story along in my opinion. Granted there were some really exciting scenes, but it wasn't enough to keep me consistently entertained. Unfortunately, it did not leave me eagerly anticipating the conclusion. I am still giving it 3 stars purely for the imagination that went into to whole series, and hopefully the third film will bring a little more storyline along with all the effects."
5,the best matrix,This one is 50x better than the first more action more plot more mind blowing speciel effects I loved this movie from start to finish a great movie buy this one.
3,Matrix-Reloaded into sequel hoopla!,"Let's face it, we were all anxiously waiting for the follow-up to the 1999 original that grabbed us all by the nuts and totally reinvented the sci-fi genre. For those years in between the sequel and the original everyone would talk about how ""insane"" the new movies would be, and finally the day came ""Matrix-Reloaded"" hit theaters, we ran to see it just as the film-makers had hoped, and then it was a thud! A thud heard across the country from countless fans. What the hell happened to our beloved franchise? What were the brothers thinking?Sure there's some kick-ass stunts and sequences but altogether this""Reloaded"" is just another LOAD!"
5,Just As Good As The Original,"Anybody who tells you that this movie wasn't any good simply didn't understand it. The plot thickens, the fight scenes get even more exciting, and the characters even more divirse.I had low expectations due to all the negative publicity this film received via the media and my friends. But after watching it, I'm glad I had to find out for myself. The end does leave you hanging, but what did anybody expect? It's just the second of a three part series. The special effects alone make this film worth watching, at least twice. In fact just buy it on DVD and keep it for further viewing in case you didn't get it the first time. After having the little ""twist"" in the plot being revealed near the end, I watched it again and caught little things here and there that indicated it. Just a great movie."
2,The movie was a real letdown,"There were too many disappointments to mention, not the least of which were, in order of depressing-ness: (1) trinity & neo looked old & tired similar to how Spock & McCoy looked in some of the later Star Trek movies (which is really sad given it was only their second movie), (2) the zion footage just didn't work, (3) the encounters between neo & the agents got old quick, (4) the philosophical ramblings were confused & rather boring, (5) etc.It's hard to understand why after such a successful first movie it took so long to make a second, and why the script wasn't better. I'd say the movie was worth about four dollars. Can't win 'em all!"
1,You Gotta Be Kidding!!!,"Everytime Keanu came onto the screen I couldn't stop myself from remembering the SNL skit of him during one of their infamous Jeopardy game spoofs (I think he was portrayed by Toby McGuire) wagering ""eleventy billion dollars"". This movie is horrible."
2,WORST SEQUEL EVER,"Wow, talk about ruining a good thing. The first matrix was a fun, extremely cool-looking sci-fi film. This movie is a bloated mess that spends half of its time pretending it's the work of some brilliant philosopher and trying to be cool. I'm sorry, but I am sick of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity walking in formation, wearing sunglasses, making jerky head movements and looking pissed off. This movie was awful - Morpheus' address to the croud was predictable, lame, and somehow the catalyst for a twenty minute ""Club Zion"" dance scene which was crap in every sense of the word. All the business with the ""architect"" was perfectly satirized by Will Ferrrel on some awards show - he just kept yelling ""vis-a-vis"" and ""ergo"" over and over again. I expected this movie to be a disappointment, but not this big of one - even the fight sequences were boring. Still, it's significantly better than ""Revolutions"", but I'd advise you never to watch either of them."
2,What Happened?,"What happened here? I loved the first Matrix film. Great plot, great acting...spectacular film. Then came the sequel, and, well...Matrix Reloaded was quite a disappointment in comparison to the first film. The entire time I was watching the film I found nothing that really grabbed me as a viewer and made me think ""WOW!"" Actually, my response was more like an unenthralled ""whoa"". Save a few well designed action and fx sequences, I couls barely keep interest in this movie. Perhaps three will be less of a frustrating disappointment than this sequel, but after this one...I'm almost afraid to even try the third. I give this film 2 stars."
2,Not worth the time or money,"This movie tried way too hard to be deep and meaningful. It felt really forced and it didn't keep my interest at all. I loved the first one so incredibly much, this was a major disapointment. Sure, you can dig into it and find all the profound things you want but the movie just didn't go anywhere. The graphics and effects were way too good for the poor quality of the story... Skip this one and go to the third."
2,The downhill slide...,"The Matrix was a great, self-contained Sci-Fi movie. It had a beginning, middle, and end, and spent most of that time kicking you in the head courtesy of wild beat-downs and gun fu. And although it had its logical flaws (entropy, anyone?) it was a clever premise well executed.It is sadly apparent that The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revollutions did not ""need"" to be made, except insofar as folks wanted to make it a franchise to print more money. Reloaded is an aimless, sterilized mess of a movie, with unexpectedly *bad* CGI in places and none of the raw punch of The Matrix. It takes too long to go nowhere, and is only saved by its hinting at Something Really Cool to come later. Unfortunately, the possibilities it hints at never come to pass... Revolutions winds up so straightforwardly dumb that even the watered-down Reloaded only sets you up for a letdown at the end of this exercise in cashing in impersonating a ""deep"" Sci-Fi experience. But that's another review."
2,That's matrix reload *snorts*,"I've watched the first matrix and nearly fell asleep. I was not sleepy at the time so don't blame it on me. I expected more from the second based on all the reviews on how cool it was. But fact did not match review. The second one was almost no better then the first one. One would have to watch it at LEAST 2 times before one get's the story. It had A LOT of talking and not enough action The only three scenes I thought was good enough to mention was the fight against 100 agents and the motorcycle sceen and the last battle other then that the whole movie was on mush(love), dreams, and more TALKING. Overall it was a an okay move. My Verdict is:1 star for 100 agents battle scene, etc.1 star for a lot of cool looking technology-1/2 star for a very confusing story-1/2 star for mush-2 stars for WAY to much talkingso only 2 stars for Matrix reload"
1,terrible and boring,This film is all about superficiality and nothing more. The fight sequences are silly as they're doing nothing more than dancing ---resurrecting those silly chop sockey choreographies I grew up watching as a kid. I'm glad my brother rented this dvd as I would never pay to see this.
1,This is the worst movie I've ever seen,"I don't understand why some people think this film is good because it is not.Don't waste your time in this ""movie"".I say it cause I lost 2 hours of my lime watching this stupid film.Do yourself a favor and get ""The lord of rings: Fellowship of the ring and Da two towers "" because these movies are excellent, classics.MATRIX RELOADED HAS TO WIN THE AWARD FOR THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR !!!!!"
4,Very entertaining.,"I think some people need to relax here! I mean, come on, people, this is not an oscar movie! hello? Stop putting this film down. I think they did a good job here. This is just a very entertaining film. Something different. If u want real drama then rent/buy something else. The highway scene was very well staged too. Boring in some parts I agree, but overall this was fun to watch."
1,THE MATRIX REFUNDED,"This movie blows...Cartoony CGI, Bad writing, poor plot development.The Bros. W. claim that this was always made out to be a trilogy.. too bad this one seems ridiculously forced.I would rather watch my wife watch Lifetime network..Nuff said."
1,please make it stop!,"and i thought the first one was bad, then i saw this and i almost puked. for the love of god do not make any more of these, they are getting old and very stupid"
5,The seckond Greatest movie ever,Holly thats all i could say when i saw it in the theater it provoked the mind and stylimated it with the quick plot and the amazing fights and i cant even comprehend why people dont like if you are reading this review WACH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW.Heres a message to all the people who dont like it its boyond your tiny little minds and this movie is beyond your comprehension.
2,Say What?,"If you disengage your brain you might enjoy Elrond of Rivendale by case attacking Neo in his Priest's get up, but by the time, you are skirting dangerous toward brain burnout! I have watched it several times, thinking maybe it was the mood I was in, but nope. Matrix was a mind-blowing one-trick-pony that just did not stretch into to a second movie well. There are a lot of interesting scenes, but Neo aka up up and away, just brought a giggle out in me. The LONG action sequences make you want to go okay, enough! Less is More is NOT the banner of this movie! After Neo b**** slap's Elrond and his brother Elrond and his other brother Elrond 100 times it just redefines redundant. Then Neo reaching in to pull out the magic bullet...oh, please...sigh...and the religious overtones are so pretensious.It was good to see Anthony Zerbe a long under rated talent get a nice spot. The effect are good, just overdone ad nauseoum. Elrond take the ship to into the West quickly!"
2,Erotix,"They should rename it. It should be entitled the Erotix, There are many scenes of Neo banging the Canadian broad. These scenes are not particularly clever, though. And I am jealous because I wish I could bone her. At any rate, there is another worthless erotix scene in a cave where the people of Zion get horny on some cheesy techno tune. That's pretty much the plot! Oh well, there is also Smith, the agent that Neo destroyed in the first Matrix. Now, not only does Smith manage to come back to life, but he clones itself a thousand times by sticking his hand into people--I kid you not.What else? While the characters were cool and tough in the first movie, here in the erotix they just want to skrew each other. I forgot, in this episode, Neo is superman.I am firmly convinced that if you enjoyed the first Matrix you will be very, very disappointed in this one."
4,Nice continuation,"It seemed you could follow the story without having seen the first part, but perhaps that's because I watched them back to back. I did tire of the fight scenes. The effects were cool, but not so intriguing since I'd seen them in The Matix."
2,no sequel intended,"The second installment to the matrix proves that there was never meant to be a second installment, The first movie finished quite properly and pretty much left enough room for a sequel but this isn't it, this just ruins the first movies aspects and is a shameless showcase of ""cutting-edge"" movie graphic technology. The philosophies, that some claim make this movie incredible, are the most useless, and cryptic ideas ever....the whole point of this movie is to trick you into believing you have seen some miracle of modern cinema but really it is nothing more than a pseudo-intelletual attempt science-fiction."
5,Reloading Rules,When you go see a sequel your hopes are never high. Many people this year have set their hopes high to see this movie. This movie is really one movie cut in half. With an amazing plot twist and angles that look like your watching a comic book the matrix reloaded is definitly the Godfather II of its time. Though the dance scene is slightly disapointing the rest of the movie makes up for it with and outstanding plot. A must buy for any DVD collection
1,I Would Have Given it No Stars...,"...but that's not an option. Quite frankly this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While the special effects are neat, I can see no reason for a 15 minute car chase (that quickly becomes boring) or a way too long sex scene. While the acting is still the same quality I found that the writing (especially the way too preachy parts) lacking."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZ.....oh! is it over?,"Not even the special efx could keep me from dozing off; tremendous let down from the first MATRIX..dialogue was slower than watching paint dry, while genuinely trying to make a point (a Positive)..was salvaged to a good degree by the most recent M effort!"
2,not very good,the characters were stupid and the action was mediocre. the agent smith fight was stupid. the car chase was probubly the best scene in the movie and there are a thousand movies that do those scenes better. this movie also has the worst sex scene ever.
1,Worst Movie EVER!!!,"This movie was a drawn out, overhyped, tooth pulling experience. The fights lasted forever. The jibberrice spoken was boring and repetative. First movie I ever walked out of. I enjoyed pranking my friends on their phones over watching this bore of a movie.Killed my plans of buying the box set."
1,They control nothing but our minds,"You pay for nothing. They get your fist born. You pat sajack! Brain dead masses. Buy this movie and see next in november. You all zombies, consumers. Consume and feel better This good, first movie soooo good. yeah right. See next two. Corporate slaves, evil FOX. You brain washed idiot. Go see this, expand your mind. Yeah right! I know what your trying do but it's not cute. Messiah. Take psilocybin and meditate on that, orcacle. Gosh, sinks this manacle before it sinks you."
3,Weirdness,"I think the problems with the script and acting have been well covered in most of the other reviews for this movie. While these factors are what makes this a mediocre film, there are other hints as to why this is the case. Given that the matrix films are so highly stylized, there are a few scenes in this movie to suggest that put into theaters too quickly.1. During the ""love"" scene, there is a line of spit extending from one character's lips to the other.2. While the French guy is making his speech, a white substance that George Carlin would call ""lip crud"" forms at the side of his mouth.I'm somewhat of a movie buff, and I can't recall another instance of mistakes like this making it past the editing process. Maybe I'm just too observant, but I caught these mistakes after just one viewing. I believe that The Matrix Reloaded was rushed into theaters. Which may account for the inadequacies of the script, and the needless mistakes above."
1,1 word 5.2,"Okay, I will admit I am a huge eddie murphy fan, but frankly, I thought his jokes in the movie were stale. Yes, I am a fan of Led Zeppelin, but that still doesnt mean I have to like the movie Home Alone. I like donuts with cream filling. Jimmied cracked corn, but honestly, who couldnt. I love Manwich. Yes I like juicy juice, what a stupid question. If a woodchuck could chuck wood, then mary kate and ashley would be real swell. schwing schwang, bling blang, i love sweet tang. Yeah I agree. Monkeys Monkeys Monkeys. MAtriculated"
3,Decent but convolute sequel that needed to stand on it&#65533;s own,"Yes, this is part of a trilogy but as a movie by itself it lacks the goods to be satisfying. There are too many questions that are raised here but not an effort to at least give a hint about what is going on. In another words, this film needed to at least give a solid story as part as a whole than to cut it off at the end with out much explanation about what is happing right in front of you. A good example of a solid middle entry in a trilogy is The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It not only expanded what was set forth with the first entry but also gave a solid story with an ending that raises the issues of what will come in the next chapter.Don't get me wrong, The Matrix Reloaded is a good film but it needed to stand on its own feet to be a solid movie."
1,Matrix 1 - Amazing... Matrix Reloaded - Ruined it...,"The original Matrix is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen - Timeless, incredibly well thought out... Simply brilliant.The Matrix Reloaded was long, boring, unimaginative and simply a way to make money off the hype built up on the first one. The only highlight in the whole movie was that it had Monica Bellucci (stunning) and somehow they even managed to make her look plain (I have no clue how they did it but they did...)My advice is that it's one of those movies that one has to watch simply because everyone else has seen it but I would never own it. Very disappointing. Very..."
1,two thumbs down,An unbelievably bad movie. I paid only $2 for a new copy and I felt completely ripped off. I wish I had those minutes of my life back.
2,FX awful /Chemistry - none /Mistakes -plenty /Lame - yep,"DISAPOINTING - a single word to describe this movie. I was one of the first to see it and was denied the touted best movie sequal of all time. Neo fight scene I feel could have been done better by the makers of southpark, cheap computer graphics that were so obvious it was a slap in the face. The love making scene was so lame it was laughable. Not to mention all the mistakes - I thought they took out all the plugs save for the brain ones...no no no they are back.this was over all a horid bomb and will only hope they spend more time on the third. Watch it only for the progression to the third."
1,A waste of everything valuable,"There is nothing in this sequel that brings new meaning to the Matrix.The script is ridiculous, there is no climax because there is no challenge: NEO can do anything he wants, fly, dodge bullets, resurrect.Morpheus is now nothing more than a lunatic, delusional freedom warrior. Zion is a joke.Dialogs are mechanical and have no flow whatsoever.The only thing amazing in this movie are the FX."
2,Changes in Style and Movie Quality,"The first Matrix Movie is my favorite movie of all time. So I was highly anticipating the sequels, which were delayed numerous times and just kept getting stalled. When i finally started watching The Matrix Reloaded after the first 15 minutes i new something was different. For some reason everything was more asian influenced. Instead of numbers, asian symbols, instead of leather jackets on Neo, asian robe/jacket, and instead of hard gritty fighting, it was more of a soft and slow style. I didnt really care for the changes but as long as the movie was decent i wouldnt mind. It was around the what seemed long an hour long dance scene i realized that this movie was nothing like its predecessor and i was extremely dissapointed. After Watching that movie I still wanted to see the next one, Matrix Revolutions, because i had already scene the first two and nothing could possibly be worse than this sequal.Five months later....i was proven wrong"
2,They should have stopped at 1...,"Sure, it's better than #2 but this third and final (good) is only marginally better. It's story is about as convoluted. I suppose one could see 1-3 over and over and over and then finally make some sense of the story but the story isn't worth that much effort. The effects are good here, the best of all of them, but it shows once again that effects cannot carry a movie. As much as I wanted The Hulk to be better than it was, I cannot believe that Matrix Reloaded got better reviews than The Hulk this year because The Hulk was watchable and understandable."
3,how did they do it,how did they make a movie like this to bad it a continue story poltholes plotholes.
2,Pretentious,"This movie wasn't as good as the first. It seems that the film crew got a big head from the success of the previous installment. The dance/sex scene was too long and irrelevant to the story. It would have OK if it were to add some amusment to the movie, but it didn't. The special effects were OK. I thought the first one did a better job. There, they'd slow something down in mid sequence, but here they'd slow down the whole scene. I think they should have paid more attention to writing story than trying to out do the previous movies fashion and special effects statements."
4,visual effects reloaded,I give it 4 stars for the visual effects only. You need to buy all 3 disks of the set to enjoy the story plot.
3,Well......,"Ok, this movie is definatly not as good as the first and is not for everybody. But I did find it entertaining. There are alot of parts that are extremely dumb and corny but then there are some others that are just so cool. And even the dumb and corny parts have something cool about them, even if it is something very small...In my opinion it is worth seeing at least once, so go see it and judge for yourself."
1,I wish I could select a quater of a star for this review,"If Jennifer Lopez decided to film her video ""Waiting For Tonight"" in Fraggle Rock, we would have had something that looked a lot like Zion. I wish someone could have prepared me for that blow before I saw this movie.Fishburn played ""Othello"" yet he could not deliver a speech to his doomed people, thankfully the population of Zion had a rave to clear thier minds of his shirtless off key dictatorship-like speech.Neo and Trinity made each other feel aquard for several minutes.Colonel Sanders controls the matrix.Hugo Weaving forgot how to act.That pretty much sums up this movie"
1,BOO HOO HOO,"Effects were great,but this movie sucked. If your a Matrix fan part 1 is the only good one to watch.It's just one of those other movies the media makes a big deal of and the people follow."
1,Full-screen?????!,"Why in God's name would you buy this, or any other DVD for that matter, in full-screen as opposed to widescreen. If you consider buying this visually stunning movie in full-screen, please send me the money instead, since you are just throwing away your hard-earned cash.Long live anamorphic widescreen!!!!!"
3,At least they tried!!!,"I have to be honest here. I had to see this movie twice, NOT because I liked it, but because the first time I fell asleep in the theater, My girlfriend woke me up a few times, when she thought something was good (she only woke me up like 2 times).When I saw it the second time I went to the IMAX theater, to see it again (but for the first time, follow me) I didn't like the movie at all. But give *** stars because The special effects were good (nothing compared to LORD OF THE RINGS), I give credit to the creators of the movie. This is one of those movies you go watch NOT because you really like it, but because for some reason People try to get you involved..."
3,too much blabbing..great action though,Let's get it straight..except for a 3 minute battle between neo and agents the first hour is just talking...and the second hour is half talking....but when the action starts its priceless..Neo vs 100 agent smiths's was awesome...the 15 minute freeway battle was also great and the battle in the french guys(i forgot his name..mera something...)palace was good too and the last scene....Other than the Action..movie is pretty flat....3 stars..fair
3,Not bad,"I thought the film was very entertaining, and I did enjoy the special effects as well as the fight scenes. I am a little confused and completely in the dark as to what the next one could possibly hold. I would have rated this a two, except that it gives you a bathroom break 1/4 th of the way through (dance scene)which worked great the second time I saw it."
1,Unload and Erase,"This is a boring piece of eye candy. The plot is tiresome and makes no sense at all. I had to watch it since it is considered such a classic series (I don't think so but that's just me). I didn't like first film very much but I liked the idea very much. K. Reeves is one of the worst actors (and I use the word loosely) on earth (worse than Tom Cruise or William Shatner). This guy's only decent role was as a moron stoner in Bill and Ted... This series needs a film called, The Matrix:Unloaded and Erased from history. I like L. Fishburne and I liked the sets and costumes but no plot, tiresome, hackneyed action scenes, and plot holes you could drive a large blazing semi truck through. Skip it or watch it on HBO, don't throw your geld away."
1,"0 stars for this stupid sequel,The Matrix Rejected","The first Matrix was terrible but now a stupider sequel to a terrible movie,some scenes and special effects are awesome,but the acting,plot,and movie are awful.the plot stinks it makes no sense,Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne-Moss give their worst roles since the first Matrix.don't watch,rent,or buy this mess."
1,Bryan,"DON'T BELIEVE ANY REVIEWER THAT GAVE THIS MOVIE MORE TAN ONE STAR.THEY WOULD ENJOY WATCHING PAINT DRY.THIS MOVIE ONLY EXISTS AS A PLATFORM FOR THE SAME OLD SPECIAL EFFECTS. SAVE YOUR MONEY, IF YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS - NOTHING DOES."
4,The Best Silent Movie Since ....,"Seriously, you just want to stick a paperclip through your ear drum if that what it takes to make the dialogue stop! Painfully shallow. The original matrix movie borrowed very heavily from Phillip K. Dick, various anime, and classic kung-fu movies. Here the brothers try to stand on their own feet and come up short much of the time.Strangely the scenes where live action is mixed with CGI are surprisingly choppy. They had the technology but they probably went overbudget.But I'll give it 4 stars because it manages to stand up to repeated viewing."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Destroys many of the great ideas set forth in the first installment. Definitely a ""Don't watch"", both from a philosophical and from an Entertainment point of view."
1,Don't Buy IT!,"OK...See it because it peaks your interest...but dont buy it! You'll be sorry , you WON'T watch it over and over like you did the Matrix. We all KNEW it was going to be a tough act to follow. The only sequels that have pulled it off successfully(?) were the Terminator and maybe Rocky..and they were ""iffy"". I don't have to go over the plot, there isn't one.It doesn't leave you wanting more , ie. the next sequel.It just leaves you pis*d off 'cause you blew $15.99! Special effects-well.. they did it already in the Matrix. Just a silly, hard to sit through DISAPPOINTMENT! Save your bucks!"
3,Mediocre Matrix,"I'm not saying that this was a bad movie- it wasn't. The Matrix Reloaded provides a very intrinsic chapter in the Matrix saga. However, the plot is not half as amazing as the first or third movies, while watching those two, there is no other opportunity for thought in your mind. The fight scenes are impressive - as always- but they go on too long, past the climax, and start to feel rather dragged out. However, important new characters are introduced in this chapter (along with one of the coolest French baddies ever to hit the screen)The DVD has tons of special features, which is always a nice plus. They include a preview for the Animatrix, whixh is also a very cool DVD in this series, providing background on the Osiris, as well as the new kid that follows Neo around in this second movie.Overall, I'd say buy the DVD if you're in love with the matrix. It's not a bad buy, and it's certainly worth th money.... and it may help tide you over until Matrix Revolutions is released on DVD."
2,Booooooring!,"When I saw the trailer, I thought it was to be a great movie. I was wrong.They messed up the plot, the action is very familiar,and it was boring! The first part was alot better. They completly messed up the series."
2,Matrix Regurgitated,"Crap. Plain and simple. Long speeches, cardboard characters, unfathomable plot twists. YUK. I'm sure there are those out there ready to crucify me but come on....I guess the new Star Wars films are good, too? The original Matrix is a fantastic, fresh, sci-fi romp. Little or none of that made it to part two. Those that absolutely LOVED the 1st film will no doubt enjoy this mess. Of course, they also bought that hideous video game....but the rest of us will yawn and say ""Why was this such a great franchise?""."
2,"Oh no, what happened?","The Matrix was not only excellent but was perfect for a series of sequels, however, the powers that be outdid themselves again, ruined a perfect story, made a silly sequel and even turned it into a mindless kung foo(l)/pseudo religious/bandstand sort of sexual piece of garbage that isn't worth the price of a ticket much less the cost of a used DVD. Wow! Did this upset me or what."
1,This movie should never have been made,"Wow, what a disappointment. This is one of the biggest letdowns in movie-making history, in my view, a sequel so bad it actually takes away from the original. And don't say that all sci-fi sequels are bad: Think of ""Terminator II,"" which actually built on the first and developed the characters. ""Matrix"" just goes off the deep end with endless speechifying, ""Battlestar Galactica"" -quality sets and enough New Age hokum to scare off a Seattle shamanistic crystal healer. And, brace yourself, they make Keanu Reeves act. Please, if you liked the original, stay away from this movie. If only someone had stopped me I would have my good memories of one of the best films of all time intact. What a disgrace."
2,What's the Big Deal?,"I saw this film during a recent trip to New York and found it so totally uninteresting that I walked out. Yes, it has plenty of impressive special effects, but there's no sustantive story to speak of. This is a classic Hollywood example of FX and very loud sound superceding plot. I found it a shallow waste of time."
2,doesn't matchup to the original,I thought the sequal was a disappointment due to the fact that it doesn't catch your attention or give you a thrill of excitement as the first one did. I'll give credit to the action scenes especially the big car chase scene but other than those points i have to say was uninteresting and boring so i recommend this to fans of the matrix series only.
4,What did you expect?,"Ok. So you can tell the CGI Neo from Keanu himself. Ok, there are some script incoherences. So what? You're watching the sequel of a movie that changed the way movies and advertising are done, a movie that is complete in every aspect and that remains faithful to all Sci-Fi great topics. But you should also remember that the creators of this phenomenon are two youngsters, who like comics, kung-fu movies, anime and videogames. It's logical to me that they included a sex-scene. And that doesn't demerit the philosophical values of the movie. A friend of mine even tried to convince me that this movies are based on Gurdjieff's philosophical system.I don't know about most people, but those of my friends who didn't like ""Reloaded"" didn't like it because they didn't understand the Architect's explanation. I did, so I liked it."
5,It's a new Millinium - Why not a better one?,"We've all put off making changes in our lives but I decided not to let another year go by before I start reaching for my ""star"". This book helped me to see the things I was doing to hold myself back, the things my friends and family were doing and best of all - how to break the patterns without destroying the relationships! This is NOT a book knocking education but rather a positive path to building a better future!Whatever it is you resolved to do this year - READ THIS BOOK and you'll learn ways to do it better - faster and easier than you ever dreamed possible."
4,Naked Doesn't Have to Mean Undressed,"Murphy tells the naked (sans sheep skin) how to dress themselves beautifully in their talents, abilities, and projected value in their prospects' futures. Murphy takes you through processes that let you know how cooked you really are, whether or not you are among the degeed.Anyone at any educational level can learn from this book. Murphy clearly understands the Pareto Rule for success: only 20% of prospects' decision-making comes from history, which includes education and experience, while 80% comes from what the prospects believe you can do for them in the future.Enough said. Buy the book and let Murphy show you your 80% prospect power factor."
5,Good towel for a Great price,"I was surprised to see that the quality was much better then I had expected!!! You can't get these towels at a better price, anywhere!! I bought them while amazon.com was having a bed & bath sale(spend $125 and save $25), which really added to my savings. I got several sets of these bath towels for myself & as gifts, for my brothers. I also ordered the Martex Egyptian big bath, hand, & wash towels.Since I had purchased several sets in various colors, I had noticed a slight difference in the thickness between some of them. The Navy was the thickest. The Burgandy, Cinnamon & Twighlight were only slightly less plush and the Antique Rose & Rattan ran a close third. They are all soft and very absorbent. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a Good towel for a Great price!!"
1,Not worth it,I got the black towels a week ago. They are beautiful and thick. Then I washed them and they had lint everywhere so I washed them again. Ok now I have washed them 5 times and they are still shedding lint. They are'nt even usable. You use them to dry off and you have black lint stuck everywhere.
2,Pretty to look at,"These towels are pretty to look at and feel soft and luxurious. Unfortunately, they just won't absorb water, even after many washings. So we hang them up on the towel rack for guests to see, and use the ratty old towels to dry ourselves off."
4,Great Buy,"I agree with other reviews. For the money, these can't be beat. I like paying less and being able to get a different set in a few years and justifying it. Years ago, I bought towels that were supposed to last 10 years and got very tired of them. These are not the best made, but they are definitely better than many I have seen for a lot more money. If you have a second home, these are a must buy."
5,They are soft and absorbent,"I love these towels! They are soft and absorbent. I suppose the only detractor is the red and black shed for a long while but other than that, cotton is a good thing against the skin."
5,Alternate Use,"I bought this set in Grey Flannel to protect my grandchildren's car seats from harsh sunlight, mostly because the color closely matches the leather upholstery in my PT Cruiser. The towels are just big enough to tuck behind the headrests and drape over the seats, keeping buckles and seats cool until we're ready to travel. They're also handy as lap robes, a quick tablecloth or blanket at the park, protecting the car's interior from rainy-day muddy tracks, and wiping up a variety of spills. Though not as soft and thirsty as my Turkish towels, these are a good value for the (sale) price, have softened with a few washings, and are certainly performing as expected. (If you don't need the washcloths, Amazon has been selling the pair of bath towels alone for less $$.)"
3,Hardcore with rock vocals,"Cast Iron Hike's ""Watch it Burn"" is a little bit different than most of the stuff in my cd collection. The vocals are sung in a rock style, instead of shouted or screamed like most bands that play this style. The music consists of hardcore riffs and there is enough variety to keep it pretty interesting. I just really don't like the vocal style for this type of music. It's different anyway, as there aren't many bands that have a similar combination. I'm pretty sure this band has broken up now, but I really feel they could have came out with a great album if they would have added a more aggressive approach to contrast the rock n roll vocals. Still a pretty decent album all around though. They certainly aren't like the many other hardcore and oi bands that have come out of Boston. I'm suprised these guys weren't a little bigger considering they were on Victory Records. If you like these guys check out the band Withstand, who also play hardcore music with sung vocals."
4,A significant resource summarizing how environmental goals c,This book is far-reaching and very well written.
1,Chinese made toys for everyone!!! Yay!,"Ok, It small parts, that get lost easily, painted with lead paint, all plastic, made by children who get paid not enough to purchase it themselves, its a waste of our earth's resources AND it will be on the earth for the next million years. Gogo get you some!"
4,Death in Hyde Park,enjoy the setting of these mysteries - my great grand parents lived in England at this time . also enjoy the develoment & use of characters Have enjoyed the historical qualty of all these books
5,Great CD!,The songs are adorable and my six year old daughter loves them. Great CD! No problems downloading. Love it! : )
1,Oh No!,"They really made this?!?!?!What's next? Kidz Hop? an album of child friendly hip hop songs, such as back that azz up and ""the Whisper song?""I would recommend this for any parent who loves the USA, and wants to raise their children to be close-minded, self-righteous, right wing automatons."
1,Information please,"I wait for this item, I paid and never send me please I need some information or return my moneyFaby"
1,such a bad movie,"This poor excuse for a sequel manages to recycle all the plot points from Donnie Darko in a boring and nonsensical way. Nothing seems to happen for a reason other than trying to make it weird and mysterious. While it attempts to appear intellectual and deep, it is quite the opposite. Don't bother seeing this, especially if you loved Donnie Darko."
1,Aweful movie!,"This movie is nothing, and I mean NOTHING, like Donnie Darko....It makes no sense whatsoever. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME."
2,the first 15 minutes..,were bad i stopped watching it after that. maybe you will like it but if you liked donnie darko DONT watch this it just tarnishes its great name!
1,Worst film I've ever seen.,"S. Darko is awful. It has way too many sub-plots for the length of the film, and none of them are done enough justice to be included. Even the ""point"" of Sam's time traveling isn't given enough attention, and loose ends are left all over the place. The acting is horrible; really, truly terrible. Maybe that was the director's fault. I can't get into everything that is wrong with this movie without spoiling it, but just know that it is awful, and I have a guilty pleasure for semi-bad movies.This film is a disaster of epic proportions, and I'm not saying that because I liked the first Darko film. This movie is bad enough without being compared to its predecessor."
2,just awful...,"I tried to go into this one with no bias.. especially since the first one was so good, I didn't want to ruin it either way. but man this was a major fail. this movie was the equivalent to an encore of your favorite band but done by badgers dropping acid, just really long and drawn out-- and maybe with a few falling rocks from the sky. ouch, not worth the watch."
2,Bad...but it sure is pretty!,"Surprised nobody has commentd on the cinematography. I think that is all that is worth seeing. Big sky and lots of color.The story was like David Lynch movies: weird for weirdness' sakes. Donnie darko had a point and the weirdness was explanable. S Darko was just a hodgepodge of randomness.To quote Shakespeare:A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
2,Lame attempt to capitalize on a modern cult classic,"If you loved, and I mean loved, the film Donnie Darko then this film might hold some appeal for you. However, if you've never seen the aforementioned ""D. Darko"" or were just a mild to moderate fan of the original film then you can easily skip this sad attempt to continue the ""Darko Mythos"" that picks 7 years after the last film with the mind numbingly lame escapades of Donnie's youngest sister. Do yourself a favor and watch the director's cut of Donnie Darko instead of this hackey sequel."
5,"Okay,i suppose","This movie really confused me.Most of the movie I was like,""What?""I think this is nothing like Donnie Darko for the most part.Theres no quirky humor.I did not find this movie funny at all.I think this movie was really bad compared to Donnie Darko...I spent way too much on this DVD.Its really not worth watching."
1,Awful!!!,"I'm a huge Donnie Darko fan and was excited to see this....I couldn't even make it past 20 minutes of this. It seems to be a pointless, boring teen film. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap."
1,horrible,"Pretty much everything that can be said about this movie is already said elsewhere. this is the cheapest, dumbest, sequel ever. The only good part of the movie was getting to see Donnie's sister Sam after she's grown up to be immersivelly hot. She is gorgeous. But what they put her through, essentially turning her into another Donnie.. is terrible.. I hope she gets in some other role, but they did her a disservice with this script."
3,Not as Good as Original,"S. Darko seemed like it was just going for weird, taking a few notes for the original but overall was a bit disappointing. Worth a watch, but not a buy.."
2,Not worth the time or money,"Even looking at this movie as its own separate entity from its predecessor, it really lacks substance. The plot goes round and round in circles, seemingly never going anywhere. I see the parallels between the pinwheel and the windmill and in the way Sam waves goodbye to Randy and the rabbit ears/mask, but so many events are not clearly explained that the movie becomes disappointing by the end. At one point, we leave the main character Sam entirely and focus through the eyes of her best friend, which totally throws off the perspective. We journey back in time a few times, when once would have sufficed, to correct any wrong past occurences. It seems we never save the little boy, and he is the reason we begin this adventure into another realm/parallel universe. Maybe there is more meaning beneath the surface that I just do not observe; so perhaps others would enjoy this trippy, nonsensical movie(???)."
1,Steaming pile,This is one of the biggest movie sequel let downs I've ever had the displeasure of. Most movies I'm upset with the way they are. I just think to myself not going to watch this again. This movie actually had me pissed off. I wanted to destroy it to ensure no other person had to torture themselves with this horrid piece of trash. Please stay away no matter how much you loved Donnie Darko.
2,Not worth watching,I am a huge fan of Donnie Darko so I decided get this movie thinking it would be good. This is probably the worst movie ever made. It made no sense at all and it was hard to follow. This movie isn't worth watching even if it was free or the last movie on the planet. I only gave it 2 stars because Matthew Davis is in this movie.
1,Terrible,"This movie is absolutely TERRIBLE!! Waste of money and time. watch Southland Tales instead. That film was made by Richard Kelly and feels like a spiritual sequel, plus it's as good as Donnie Darko."
2,S. Darko,"Nothing like Donnie Darko except a few references, so people who enjoyed the original will probably not like this movie. As a stand-alone movie, it seems to drag on but might be worth a watch if you're not a big fan of Donnie Darko."
3,Parallel Universes and Time Travel are still Fun...,"Rarely are sequels better than the original. So it should come as no surprise that this isn't as good as Donnie Darko. Was it a necessary sequel to make, maybe not. However, S. Darko does a great job at exploring the mythology of time travel through black holes and the theory of it's consequences.The film itself looks and sounds great. While many of us will miss the 80's esque mood of the first film, this is a very stylish and well edited movie in it's own right.It has enough uncertainty and fragmented symbolism that will have you rewatching it. Trying to find some understanding while putting the pieces together was part of the fun of the original!If Donnie Darko was 4-5 Stars this is an easy 3!"
1,"Great Film,..For Christophobic Humanists","To be brief,..so as to not waste your time like I did on this movie.Yet another in a very long list of films that portray Christians in an intolerant disrespectful and judgmental way. A ridiculous film about the universe being saved by young beautiful and perfect, anti-Christian secularists that have superior morality, supernatural spiritualism, and intellect.In other words,....Godless democrats saving the world,...again, and making you hate Christians while doing it."
1,WARNING DONNIE DARKO FANS,Donnie Darko is one of the greatest movies of our time. S.Darko should have never been made. It's an abomination to an amazing film.
1,Welll...,"I couldn't watch this because Amazon.com failed to tell me that blu-ray movies are coded, just like dvds. So I opened it meaning no refund, and have no lost $30. Awesome."
2,"horrible movie, good seller","this movie is absolutely awful. they tried to warp the idea of donnie darko and they totally failed. DO NOT WATCH DO NOT BUY. I did recieve the movie in great condition and very quickly, thanks for prompt delivery!"
2,Muddled.,"Some of the cinematography is pretty nice, and some of the music fits the scenery well -- but that's about the only things the movie has going for it. The main characters aren't all that interesting, with only a few of the supporting characters making an impression. Although the movie seemed to know what it was doing with it's own convoluted time travel logic it didn't seem to know what it had to say about the human condition, if anything. Which is a shame. I don't regret watching it -- if you're a curious Darko fan, you might as well rent it. Just expect very litttle."
2,poorly made,"I purchased this shoes for a bikini competition. I only walked around the house in them a couple of times and the straps became very loose. I knew they would stretch some due to being plastic, but not like that! My foot continued to side forward even after putting in a no-slip insert. Some of the diamond studs also came off. The trim was not connected to the shoe very well. If you're doing a competition I suggest getting a shoe that has an ankle strap."
4,Un buen libro de referencia,"Recientemente hice mi primer viaje a 8 ciudades europeas (Londres, Bruselas, Berna, Roma, Florencia, Barcelona, Madrid y Paris) usando este libro, usando sus recomendaciones en hoteles, museos y otras atracciones, lo único que deberían mejorar son los mapas, pero se complementa bien con los mapas que regalan en las agencias de información turística. Muy buen libro, muy actualizado."
3,odd they brought kara back,"liked the Maetrix/Linda Danvers supergirl, plus there are an oddly numerous amount of Krypton survivors, takes away from Clark's last survivor thing"
3,Satan Won't Leave Me Alone,"What's the deal with ""Satan""?? This was first released in the UK as a single some-odd years ago, and has since reappeared on (by my count) six different Orbital releases.IT'S NOT THAT GOOD! I'm a big fan of the Bros. Hartnoll, but ""Satan"" isn't one of their best tunes, and even if it was, I think six releases was four or five too many. This version is graced by Kirk Hammett's rockin' geee-tar, and it does beef up the sound a bit. But in its gut it's the same Ol' Scratch. Get thee hence, Lord of the Flies!Two excellent live tracks and the cheap-o price make this a nice bargain all-around, especially if you don't already have the live tracks on two of the three ""Satan Live"" E.P.'s. But pray for these guys. Pray that The Evil One releases them from this apparent obligation to re-release a so-so track at least once a year. And, heck, go buy it."
1,Inaccurate description of product,"Both the Amazon and Northern Tool descriptions show a 25-inch pound (lower reading) torque wrench. But when I got it, the lower reading was 50-inch pounds, which did not meet my needs. When I returned it because of the inaccurate description, the refund did not include the mailing cost of the return item. When I tried to get the problem resolved, Northern Tool asked that I just order another one--I did and got the same 50-250-inch pound wrench that I didn't want in the first place. It's a nice tool if you don't need readings from 25 to 50-inch pounds, but it's just not as described by the sellers."
1,Rip-Off,This supplier has ignored my attempts to return the incorrect mechandise. The phone number given on the Amazon website is no longer in service. The supplier Idea-mojo has not responded to my emails. They are a rip-off!
3,Me Not Likey Edit Either,"Folks, Charlie ain't the only thing they messed with. The opening theme has been edited towards the end just before Magoo looks through the two O's. I remember the bit of music that's missing because I have an old recording of it. But I can't remember the video portion so can't even hazard a guess why it was removed. Fortunately the box set I ordered was from a lower priced store."
3,still waiting,"Does anyone know when this set will be released? I pre-ordered it in April of 2005 and never heard anything on it since. I wanted to give it to my father for father's day, then his birthday, then Christmas.......is it really not being released until 2010?"
1,"26 Made-for-TV cartoon shows, not the UPA toons.","All 26 of the Saperstein made-for-TV Magoos are due for DVD release by ""Classic Media"" for Spring 2006.The above notice from Sony indicates it will probably not be the originals produced by UPA. Fortunately whey were released decades ago on VHS & Laserdisc."
1,Don't give us the wrong Charlie!,"I, too, am hoping that these cartoons are the true originals...I had bought a number of them on VHS for my husband last Christmas, after a long search, and we were both VERY dismayed to hear Charlie's voice dubbed in--not only without any accent whatsoever, but poorly done in a monotone. They were ruined, in our opinion, as we remembered the ""broken English"" Charlie very fondly. If I'd been able to do so, I would have returned them promptly. So...can someone let Mr. Magoo fans know if we're going to get the real thing when we purchase this collection on DVD?"
2,Not the classics I was expecting...,"I grew up in the 70's watching ""whats new Mr. Magoo"" and had no idea ofthis 1960's saturday morning show. In 1984, my older brother had rentedVHS Mr. Magoo classic shorts from the 1940's through the 1950's. Theywere truly the best. I was hoping that this box set from the 60,s wouldhave some of these shorts at least as bonus video to show how Magooevolved. Anyway, I only laughed a few times and these cartoons weremade cheap. The original Waldo was more dimwitted in Those classicshorts. They were a little darker and were made more for adults. I havewatched the first three disk and will not watch anymore I, too, wasupset over the Cholly ""Charley"" voice change. I do, believe it or not,have this 1960's Mr. Magoo Board Game. It must have been reissued in1977 when ""Whats new Mr. Magoo was debuing. I bought it at K-mart andit has most all the character's from the 60's show. If you love any-thing Magoo, then buy this DVD set for your collection. If not, saveyour money."
2,Product description is WRONG,"This is NOT ""Animated series featuring Jim Backus's Mr. Magoo character in half-hour adaptations of classic stories for children."" But in fact is 26 episodes of 5 cartoons each for a total of 130 cartoons--not the ""classic stories"" described above."
2,"Oh PC Weenies, you've done it again!...","...to paraphrase Magoo himself. Well, I guess that's the main reason for customer reviews--to pass on info to other customers that isn't in the buy-it biased blurb paragraph provided on the page. And it sure tipped me off. I've just bought ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" from Marketplace--it's in the pipeline--after losing track of my tape of it, and I'm fairly sure that hasn't gotten the post-Soviet revisionist ""surgery"". As I recall from my VHS of the feature, Charlie isn't in it, and I guess Gerald Mc Boing Boing's protrayal of Tiny Tim with slight babytalk accent wasn't worth the trouble of dubbing out. But who knows what the future brings? I'm still waiting for the PC weenies to decide that the whole concept of Mr. Magoo is politically incorrect due to his myopia being an insult to the visually impaired."
4,Mr. Magoo makes the entire family laugh,I loved to watch Mr. Magoo when I was a kid. I bought this dvd to share with my kids and they think it is hilarious. There is some cartoon violence but no one ever dies or gets hurt.
1,Charlie's voice overdubbed,"In every episode that Charlie has more than one line in, his voice is overdubbed in a ridiculous, intrusive voice that makes the episodes unwatchable. It's not just that they gave in to political correctness and changed his voice, but they didn't even do a good job. Most of the first disc soundtrack is intact (probably so those of us who were watching to see if they would change the voice would put in the first disc, hear the original voice and declare the box set O.K. I think that is what happened to some of the reviewers on this page). Just put in some of the later discs and be prepared for a big shock. These cartoons are great and my rating would be five stars if they were not tampered with. As it is though I cannot recommend this unless of course you really don't mind or, God forbid, you agree that hearing an exaggerated Japanese accent is going to corrupt the world as we know it."
1,"Warning: These episodes are NOT the classic ""Mr. Magoo"".","The original short UPA theatrical release Magoo cartoons, from 1949-1960, were brilliant. Two of them won Academy Awards. Unfortunately they don't seem to be currently available in a DVD format. This collection of Magoo cartoons is from the 1960's television show, and all suffer from inferior animation, boring plots and pointless side-kicks. Furthermore, as many have noted, the overdubbing of Charlie's voice is intolerable. The vocal characterization of Magoo by the great Jim Backus (who also did the voice of Magoo in the theatrical release cartoons), however, is always entertaining and is one of the best features of the Magoo series.Hopefully we won't need to wait too long for the DVD release of the earlier theatrical Magoo cartoons, but in the mean time don't waste your money on this collection."
1,ANOTHER LOST SALE!!!!!!!,"As the alien in PLAN 9 said, ""...Idiots, you're all idiots!""...Hoping not to lose a few sales to PC consumers the manufacturer dubbed Charlie's oriental voice into proper english thereby losing thousands of sales to customers like me who want the real thing. And now it's probably not profitable to re-issue the cartoons correctly. And the PC people aren't going to buy Magoo anyway, or just complain about poking fun at the visually and/or hearing impaired!!!! Somebody needs to be fired... IDIOTS!!!!"
1,I Refuse To Buy This Ruined Version Of Magoo!!,"I give this a 1 star because I'm forced to rate it. Otherwise I would give it zero stars. But, I will not buy this official version of the series until Charlie's voice is restored to the original one.I am, however, seeking out a pirated version of the original series in which the show is truly original as it should be, Political Correctness be damned.Your loss, current Magoo DVD bean counters/marketers. You all want my hard earned dollars then you need to earn them by treating me with respect and not insult me with current PC trends and restore Charlie's voice to its original one."
1,Disappointed,"Wow. That's very disappointing about the voice-overs. I was going to buy this after seeing the Magoo Christmas special again but I've decided not to buy the ""original"" episodes in this form. I hope they decide to release this in an unedited format. Thanks for the warning."
1,Only half of the book,"I recently gave away my full version of Saphir's Hebrews as a gift, and reordered this version to replenish my library. It's not bad in terms of presentation, but the problem is that this is only the second half of the book! It doesn't say that anywhere on the page. If you want the full version of Saphir's book, you'd better look elsewhere."
3,Lots of lullabies but no music/notes,"Lots of childhood favorites/ones I wanted for the kids but... no music! I bought this with the idea that lullabies are *songs* and wanted the notes to sing/play, but this book only has the words."
2,I should have listened to the reviews,The book is small and compact which is great for travel. The cover design is was attracted me to purchase this item. The reason I returned it was because there is no indication of how to read or sing the songs. It was frustrating and I wouldn't recommend this item.
3,"No music notation, only lyrics","I'd love to sing these lullabies and songs to my twins, but there is no music notation only lyrics. The poems are nice and it is a beautiful little book, however."
3,Could've been better if...,"This is a darling little book and I LOVE the poetry and lullabies. But, as one may expect, there's no music included. So, I'm on a desperate search for the tunes to some of these beautiful poems so we can enjoy them even more."
5,PAVILHAO 9 RULES!!!!,"If you liked the 80's punk scene in Sao Paulo, listened to Garotos Podres, Ratos, Inocentes , Ira, Colera and digged the Ataque Frontal recordings. Pavilhao 9 is for you. This is the revival of the Punk era with a 90's hip-hop taste to it. buy both cds They are better than so many American bands."
1,Yuuuck!,"This product was Bad, I fully gave this product a full chance to even grow on me, but it never did. It was the Maca I'm afraid. The one without Maca it tasted much better."
2,grassy flavored protein powder,"Not the worst tasting protein powder, but not the best either. Interesting additions not found in traditional powders."
3,good but not great,"in my opinion the only worthy tracks are 1,6,8,and 9, otherwise the rest of the album are filler in my opinion,unless you're a DJ of course. i don't know, i just never appreciated rappers who go on about how great they are. if rock singers did that noone would like them, so why is it acceptable to call someone great if all they really rap about is themselves? i know that i'm alone in my opinion. now i will admit that the guy can rap and the DJ can scratch and mix but for alot of these tracks they just seem to go on forever and w/o meaning. give me Public Enemy any day of the week. at least they spoke of important issues."
1,Pure Garbage!!!!,"Look I love hip-hop music but I've always been a skeptic of these two clowns. I know everybody thinks Rakim is the king of rap. Everytime I hear that I think, ""are these people just being sarcastic or what!"" He must have subliminal mind control messages is his whack ass tracks because from start to finish this cd was pathetic. I never felt them. I thought I was missing something when I first heard them as a teenager and thought they were whack. I decided as an adult I'd give another listen. I was right when I was a kid! I'm an underground music producer. I listen to everything for inspiration. Point blank range: Uninspiring. Don't buy. I'll gladly give you my copy. It's crap. I ain't lying to you."
1,A classic? Yes. Worthy? Certainly not.,"I ve been listening to old school hip hop for years, trying to separate the bad from the good out of today's perspective and how much these records can be regarded as influential...well my opinion is that there are a hundred old school hip hop albums or 45s out there that are way more worth put your money in. Believe me, this album is mega overrated. Even the most memorable song I know you got Soul falls short compared to late 80s standards.This classic album has grown old in a very bad way, which is a shame when you consider that even 1st generation classics generally end up sounding way better by today's standards.I regret buying this for $7 on sale...do yourself a favor, listen to it before you make the same mistake I did..."
3,This was ok,I got it in the mail fairly quick and was excited.I like it alot but some songs repeat. Not the worstand not the best. Just ok.
5,"More than just a ""classic""","Paid in full is more than a classic. It was a masterpiece that is among the greatest records ever made in rap history. I'd say it was the perfect blend of catchy beats and rhymes that flowed like water. My favorite song of all time is My Melody especially when Rakim dropped ""I'll take 7 mc's....."" (u know the rest). I Ain't No Joke, Move The Crowd, I Know You Got Soul, and Paid in Full were also hot. This is one you gotta have in the collection cause it was one for the ages."
5,It reminded me of what rapp once was.,Eric b. and rakim arem pioneers in the rap industry. This album is a perfect mix of old school and new flavor without all of that studio GANGSTAISM.
5,This guy fathered the whole hiphop game after 1987 and beyond,"This is one and only truly classic album by Eric B and Rakim that stands the test of time. Impeccable rhyming at its finest. Rakim's delivery was just unbelievable back in 86. No one had rapped like that up to that point. The music by Run DMC, LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys was loud and rock influenced. Eric B's deep (Dennis Edwards) baseline on the song Paid in Full was a changing of guard. Ra's slowed down flow was next level. Fav's are the entire album. Nuff Said."
5,Hip Hop 101,Rakim was way ahead of his time on this album....This album proves why he is considered the greatest mc to ever bless the mic.....This album is timeless ....Its easy to see how much Rakim changed hip hop forever with this album
1,Never Arrived,So we cancelled the order. It was cancelled without any problem. That is a positive note...
5,Instrumental,The product description suggests that this release contains explicit lyrics. This is NOT the case. This is an instrumental band (i.e. No vocals = no explicit lyrics...)
3,Not Anamorphic Widescreen,"Despite what the packaging may say, neither movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen. The menus for each DVD are 16x9 and play fine on a widescreen tv, but both movies play in 4x3 letterboxed mode and do not fill the screen."
4,All-star trashy fun!,"While Volcano is trashy fun with an emphasis on special effects, I definitely bought this double feature for The Towering Inferno. It rates alongside The Poseidon Adventure as one of the great disaster films of all time, and still holds up well today. The cast is top notch, from top billed stars including Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, to campy cameos from the likes of Fred Astaire, and names which have grown in either stature or infamy as the years have passed... O.J. Simpson, and Susan Flannery who found late stardom as the matriarch of The Bold and The Beautiful. The pre-CGI special effects are good, and while there is much fun to be had guessing which of the big stars will live or die, there's also plenty of tangible suspense in the situations and set pieces of the inferno itself. Top this off with garish Seventies decor and fashion, and Richard Chamberlain's OTT bad guy, and you have a fantastic couple of hours entertainment. This film is just begging for a remake!"
1,Does not kill as advertised,Placed in the corner of my barn (24' x 36')and it has killed 20 flys in 14 days.
2,Your people my people,"It appears the way the author wants the my people to happen is for Jews to convert. That's how your people will become my people (a reverse of the text in Ruth), by them converting their Judaism into a Christian version. He has the typical Messianic longing for unity into ""one new man"" a stock phrase indicating conversion as the route it will happen. Where is the part where Christians honor current Jewish and Israeli heritage? (Not simply from the time of Jesus).I suggest getting an out of print book by A. Roy Eckhardt ""My People Your People"" for a clear description of all the hidden assumptions that Christians carry around on this topic. Conversionist routes are akin to replacement theology since they still hold to the need for Jews to change their hearts and minds. Unless I missed it he doesn't appear to allow for Jewish salvation outside of accepting Christ. Mary C Boys is a good author on an alternate approach to this subject."
5,"Incredible Book, easy to follow","This is an incredible book for opening your eyes to where we should be in relation to our Jewish brothers and sisters. It is very easy to read, but it does challenge you to go deeper into studying God's word.After I finished reading this book, it changed the way I read and studied my bible. I no longer read the bible thinking it's all about me, here in America(replacement theology). When the bible talks about Israel, it means Israel. I believe in this book so much that I bought a case of them (60) and have been passing them out. I consider it an investment into God's kingdom. It's time for the American church to realize our part in ""praying for the peace of Jerusalem"".Don's follow-up book ""Future of Israel"" is also a fantasit book. He is an excellent, understandable writer!"
4,"A ""must read"" for every Christian","This book is very well written, and is a ""must read"" for every Christian. I also highly recommended it for those strating out on their journey to find the Jewish roots of Christianity. It also has encouraging moments of personal faith in action. I recommend it highly."
2,Compassionately Misguided,"Though Dr. Finto is a wonderful man, whose thoughts are always interesting and whose very life is a sermon in compassion, he is misguided when it comes to the Jewish people and Israel. Jews are a people of great heritage, who continue to contribute much to the modern world, but Christianity, for better or worse, is a religion with its own integrity and independence from its historic parent. Dr. Finto does not understand the agony of the Palestinians deprived of their home in the holy land. Nor does he seem to realize how Christianity itself is struggling for its very survival in the place of its origin. Christians, Jews, and Moslems must work together for common goals and respect one another, but they are unlikely to be converting each other in mass."
4,I like it,I bought it for a gift. It is a decent item for the cost. It seem to be of sound quality for twenty bucks. It plays a melody and unless you are an extreme collector or music critic it does that fine too. An extreme collector of Disney might complain the melody is at a higher speed that the original and a music critic would say the melody is just a series of beeps. A normal person would say the melody is too long. An average disney fan would find this a neat little gift.
5,Economics 101,"For anyone who didnt ""get"" what happened to the financial markets in the fall of 2008, This explains everything. In my opinion."
5,Stunning!,"This is a must see... along with Inside Job.The story is incredible... One caution: it's tough to keep all the players straight. I had to watch it a number of times in order to follow the cast of characters. You'll need to have time when you can concentrate to watch it.It's a tale of tumbling dominos.... you'll be shocked at how the key players were not at all in front of what was happening. The story is incredible, complemented by excellent acting and a great cast.Inside Job gives a longer term view of some of the same players (please see my review)... and their relationships before, during, and after the crisis. Shocking!I hope this is helpful."
5,Informative,Althought this is a fictional account of how the economy tanked it help give a clear picture of how all the elements came together.Yes I would reccommend this movie to a friend
2,Unnecessary Foul Language,"The video was a great source for describing the events up to and around the Wall street debacle. Unfortunately, the movie folks wanted to keep the guidance rating up so they included most of the offensive language in the movie. Paulsen seems to have a potty mouth. I had wanted to show this video to my HS econ classes but the language would get me fired if I did. We don't use the ""F"" word at school even though the kids hear it often on HBO and seem to use it rather frequently as the adjective of choice. I guess I will wait for the "" censored"" version."
4,Too big too fail,Everyone should watch this film. And how come those who made this happen are still in their jobs and not brought up on charges. They are still making life miserable for most of America.
4,Fine acting almost sells the film,"""Too Big to Fail"" reminds us that nothing is too big too fail, especially in the world of high finance and risk taking. Revisiting the Wall St. bailout, the film gives us a wide range of wonderful actors in a variety of dramatic roles, none the more outstanding than William Hurt, who plays Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Paulson's job is ""simple""...to keep the American economy from going into free fall and Hurt is terrific in the role. But I found the dialogue stilted and unimaginative. No one except Paulson ever has a good word, it seems, or a noble thought throughout much of the film. While this helps to create some tension and give Hurt's character credence, it lacks spontaneity. ""Too Big To Fail"" succeeds, but it could have been an even better film."
1,MINDLESS,"This dramatization is focused on the effort of seemingly sincere and earnest people trying to do the best for the American people and the world. The movie ignores the political CAUSES; namely, the deliberate intent to distribute wealth, by having the government knowingly guarantee the loans of people who could not afford the houses they were buying. The whole intent and effect was to seize $700 billion of those who earned and saved the money and give it to home buyers who could not afford their home purchases."
1,too big to fall,"Unfortunately, Twice in a role, the DVD which I have ordered does not play on my player. It might be different region. The movie is great (I heard) but what good is that if I cannot play it a all. Your refund policy is great!"
1,Aimed at simple minds,"The technical aspects are basically true, but the movie itself is pue phony political prpaganda. Far too many examples to cite."
1,Bad movie,"This is boring, and a waste of money. It is too complicated to follow. Do not waste your money like I did."
3,Good. . . but not Great,"This game is good I must admit, but once you complete the first 2-3 levels... it gets boring. It's pretty mucht he same chalanges over and over again,(but at a different place).Oh yeah... the songs u can listen to are Horrbible. One sond from Iron Maiden is the best song in thw world... and the only 1/4 deacent in this game. They need to put more Maiden... and forget this punk stuff. Either way... it's not as good as i hoped."
5,FLIPEN SWEET,this game is the best ever. atuily i liked underground a bit more but. this game is great and worth every penny. you can play as soo many skaters and the creat a skater option is better then ever its like the sims...kinda... yeah i agree the screams are a lil much but...she split in half? like a glitch?... huh anyway this game is the bomb BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!
4,...ya,"thps4 is here, and its the best by far. in thps3, no one knew where bob burquist was. well hes back, and the levels dont have boundaries! no time limit, just like the real world!"
5,Stunning Graphics and Addicting Gameplay,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 may very well be the best skateboarding game ever conceived. The variety of challenges is astonishing, and the graphics are just really slick and smooth. The controls are also wonderful, absolutely nothing to complain about.Another wonderful feauture in this game is the replayability, it is virtually endless, as well as the in game cheat codes you can spend your, ""cash"" on.In the end, this is an incredible game that can't afford to be missed."
2,Fun But......,This game is fun for a little while but after you get some good levels you don't really want to play any more. I got up to the shipyard level and just got bored with the repeditive tasks. After you play the game through you expect it to be fun for ever but since you already spent all the time on a game that gets boring so quick you just don't want it any more. [...]
3,Decent Book.,"All the odd questions are easy and the same, the even ones are harder,.They only have the answers to the odd numbers in the back. So if you are trying to check your work you have to wait for the instructor. i"
3,Doesn't Measure up.,"I was disappointed after going through this text book and discovered several missing pages. Granted I did buy it used, but there were no indications that it would be missing pages. Other than that the text is great."
5,Fresh New Sound,"Lori Denae is such a great find for any of you music lovers out there. Her vocals are sweet and her lyrics profound. The melodies stay with you, long after the CD has finished playing. A must-buy, if only for her incredible rendition of ""She's a Beauty."" And she is."
5,A Helpful Friend,"Not being very crafty,I'm afraid, when I decided to redecorate my house, this book was recommended to my by a friend.To my surprise, the book gave lots of well explained ideas. I went from room to room, changing this wall here, this corner there, and new lights everywhere.My house looks better than ever.I am thankful to the authors, for sharing their ideas and talent with readers like me."
4,What Goes With What. makes Home Decorating Easy!,"I really enjoyed What Goes With What. My interest in home decorating drew my interests to the book and it delivered a quality, clear, creative approach to my hobby which brings me many hours of joy. I was very impressed with the books read. It was easy to follow and made great sense. Even my friends new to Home Decorating enjoyed the basics inside. I consider What Goes With What an essential manual in my Home Decorating Library! Thank you for your advice, help and creativity! What Goes With What has helped me take my creativity to the next level! I recommend it to all home decorators interested in sparking flames of creativity!"
3,Not bad but there are better books around,"This book gives me some good information but nothing new------and not as much information as some other decorating books. I'd give this a C+. It's a surprisingly small volume (120-some pages). My favorite book is still The New Decorating Book, because it covers absolutely everything and has hundreds of color photos in its 400 or so pages. Very comprehensive but great to look at also. I learned about the New Decorating Book from a neighbor whose daughter was using it as an interior design textbook in a local junior college."
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this book thinking that it would help me learn more on the subject. It just didn,t. It lacks of color ilustrations or pics of any type. Just a few ilustrations at the begining. Don't waste your money in this item!"
5,"This is a ""Gotta Have"" for Board Members","This is a lot of wisdom in a small space, an easy to read-and-understand approach to determining if a non-profit board is doing what it should be doing. Each brief chapter focuses on one idea, and leaves no doubt in a reader's mind about how to determine what would work best for their organization. I am already using that one sentence, ""It's negligent to keep investing money in programs without proof they make a difference,"" as part of my discussions with clients. This is a book I can, and will, recommend to clients and colleagues, secure in the knowledge that they will thank me for the recommendation."
3,A gift,My sister inlaw purchased her first digital camera and the memory card which came with the camera was very small so she became very disappointed with the camera. She had absolutely no knowledge at all on the operation of the camera with the exception of just push the button. Since she had no knowledge of the camera she was unable to even set the camera up so I purchased this larger memory stick for her and proceeded to give her some instructions. With everything set in the automatic mode she won't have any problems and can just keep pushing the button. Now she is very happy to have a much larger memory stick.
5,GREAT ITEM,NEEDED A MEMORY STICK FOR A VERY OLD SONY DIGITAL CAMERA. THIS WAS THE ONLY PLACE I FOUND ONE. THANKS TO SONY FOR DIRECTING ME TO THIS WEBSITE
3,it was interesting,it was interesting but surprised how little time she spent with her sons. She needs to disappear and let her boys grow up with their mum away from the cameras like Demi Moore and Bruce Willis did with their kids.
5,The Best DVD Britney EVER,THIS DVD IS THE BEST DVD OF BRITNEY EVERHAVE EXTRAORDINARY BONUS FEATURESBRITNEY'S CRYING MOMENT IS AMAZINGI CANT WAIT FOR THE CIRCUS SATARRIND DVDBRITNEY THES BEST
3,Eghh....,"THis video was not what i thought it would be. It was actually quite boring. Some parts were interesting, but most of it was just dumb. She vaguely explains the answers that everyone has been wanting to hear over the past year. After watching this video, I really dont know why any of this crap still happened!! So i believe this was just a money making attempt. I love Britney, but this was a horrible video."
3,facing the music,"I was really looking forward to this doco - unfortunately it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The interviews with Britney are interesting: she's incredibly frank and comes across as a young woman who's been thrown into the deep end without really being prepared for what's going to happen. Sadly though, the pacing and editing make for a fairly slow doco that wouldn't really hold up to more than one viewing unless you are a completely obsessed fan (or someone doing a thesis on modern fame and it's perils.) For the casual fan I would probably recommendThe Singles Collection (Special Edition) (CD/DVD)for the great pop promos and performances she gives."
4,Momma loves Britney - now loves For The Record...,Picked this up for my wife as she has been a Britney fan since JT in the early 2000's... Great disk and interview point of view gives you her side of the story - not just the tabloid's... she loves it so 4 stars!
5,Works great.,"I have had one of these for about 9 months. If you follow the directions on installing the batteries in the base unit first and then the remote sensor, especially when the batteries die in either unit, everything works well. I called customer service once because of this, and while it took a little while on hold, their person who answered was very knowledgeable and quickly solved my problem. I bought a second one for my mother."
1,Chaney Instruments Acu-Rite 00972 Wireless Weather Thermometer,Don't buy. It's terrible. Temperature readings are incorrect. Clock resets to the incorrect time. And it loses the signal from the remote sensor (12 feet away). I'm sorry I wasted my money on this.
2,Ok,Gives you a good idea of the general temp and humidity. Not as accurate as another model from the same company. The moon phase part just cycles repeatedly showing from one moon to the next. Muay be a glitch but can be aggravating. Only other complaint is the numbers are somewhat small
4,Parakeet Album,A collection of Jimmy Buffett songs sung by children. A great cd to play for your child that any adult can easily listen to!
5,Music for the ages,"I was fortunate to get a couple of early copies - my son sings on this CD (he's the kid with the cheeseburger photo in the liner) and all of my children attended the W.O. Smith Music School. I love Jimmy Buffet and loved him even more when I heard the pure joy of life in these (sometimes carefully sanitized) songs. The voices are young, pure, and just plain fun. Gonna put it on right now."
4,Daughter loves it. Cleans up some lyrics for the kids.,"Needless to say, ""Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screw"" is not included in this collection of Jimmy's songs sung by kids. I personally found the voices a bit annoying, but my 4-year-old daughter and her cousin both love it. Great for parrotheads who are raising little Buffett fans, but don't want their children hearing some of the more adult lyrics. Worth the money for Buffett fans with families"
5,Beaultiful,"The only word I can use to describe this cd. One of the best things I bought this year, but if you are not sure if this style of music are for you, listen to Wasteland and Severina, if you liked BUT IT!!! The others are wonderful...It's a shame Amazon doesn't have the band's newest CDs... the imported are too espensive..."
5,Five stars just ain't enough,"One of the best compilation albums of all time - but then what can you expect from the best band since Led Zeppelin?Kicking off with the mighty Wasteland, the album covers the full spectrum of The Mission's work, including the breathtaking Butterfly On A Wheel and Deliverance, from Carved In Sand.It is only when you hear track after classic track coming at you that you realize just how strong this band really are. Wayne is a superb lyricist, drawing on everything from Arthurian mythology to important social issues, as in the child abuse song, Amelia.Just scanning the Amazon readers' reviews gives you some sense of the quality of this album. While I may have a slight bias, coming from Leeds in England, the fact that other fans from all over the world are equally blown away, speaks for itself.Utterly beautiful album."
2,Only a few good songs,"I only found about 4 good songs in this album (the first three and the last one). Mission was in those ""Customers who bought this also bought"" lists. Sadly I took a chance on Sum & Substance. It just sounded like a weird mixture of Simple Minds, Bon Jovi and U2, the chords are very 'pop', I got tired of it fast. They're not bad, just not for me."
1,evil beyond comprehemsion.,"Donations to charitable is controlled in' Rome, at the Vatican bank. What happens with monies at the Vatican' Bank is secret that even God is not allowed to know. Mother's outlets in poor countries do not benefit. The biographer of Mother T. Kathryn Spink, writes, `As soon as the' sisters became established in a certain country, Mother normally withdrew all financial support.' Branches in very needy countries Only receive start-up assistance. Most of the money remains in the Vatican Bank."" Let truth pervail. Do not donate to Catholic Church. Have they done enought damage not to mention the brutal sex attacks on innocent human sould to rip a boys life to smithereens. to protect evil brutal preverted men who want to rape the innocent."
