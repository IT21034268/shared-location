4,Easy Setup,"Setup was as you would hope (expect?). Simply plugged it in, registered it with my ISP and everything worked great. Did not rate it a 5 as I have only had it a month or so and realibility will take a while to determine."
5,"For me, this modem just works","I am using this modem with Comcast cable service. We're using an airport to distribute the service to five or six pcs, every one of them is getting over 6 kbps regularly.Installation was non-existent. Plug in power, cable, ethernet to airport, done. I haven't touched it since.So for me, a great device that I hope never to have to think about again :-)"
4,This does the job...,"This product is just what I was looking for. The modem has fast through-put, and was easy to install. And the price was right. What more could you ask for? (Besides THAT, I mean...!)"
4,No Problems - Just Like to Want It,This item is nothing less than you would prefer when buying technology. Take it out of the box and use it. Set it and forget it.
5,Works just fine,"Not much to say, really. This modem works just fine, out of the box. No problems with it, whatsoever. If you've got experience with cable modems and how they work with home networks, swapping it for an existing modem is a painless piece of cake, no need to reference documentation at all. In fact, this replaced a DSL modem in our home network. The only thing that needed ""doing"" was for the cable tech to call in the MAC address and serial number.Price is reasonable, performance is as claimed, this is a solid product.Recommended buy."
1,Buyer beware,"I bought this modem used through Amazon. I could not connect it to my Comcast cable because Comcast insisted the modem's MAC ID number was attached to another account. They could not find the account in their system, so it may have been an account with a different internet provider. I could not locate the provider. The seller suggested I mail it back to him,and he would send me a check for the postage. If he does not, Amazon promises a gift certificate equal to the postage to be applied to my next purchase at Amazon.My rating applies to the experience not to the modem itself which I haven't used."
1,"ARRIVED DOA,BUYERS BEWARE","The SB5120 is a Crumby cable modem,And AMAZON Wouldn't replace this piece a junk & I do lots of buying from Amazon, AMAZON You know you shouldn't forget Who Your GOOD CUSTOMERS ARE!!!! And who keeps y'all in a job in these dire Times.... Motorola SURFboard SB5120 - Cable modem - external - Hi-Speed USB / Fast Ethernet - 38 Mbps"
1,Modem,Took three weeks to get here and when it arrived was not in its original packaging. And now come to find out it doesn't even work!
1,THING WAS BROKEN,"Had to send it back to Amazon. Amazon refused to pay the 7 dollars UPS shipment cost. Told me cause it was initially sent via ""free shipping"", can't reimburse shipping costs.I rate this a 'no-stars' transaction"
1,Bad seller!!,Product showed up on time (internet modem) and was as described. Seller sold me an internet modem with no power cord.. I thought I was saving five dollars buying from this seller only to have to go out and spend another $28 on a power cord for the modem... Caveat Emptor people!!!!!
1,refurbished means nonfunctional,"I bought this modem refurbished. It had a comcast logo on it, which made me think that it might be stolen. It didnt work, and it made a horrendous buzzing sound right when I plugged it in. Big waste of money."
1,DIDN'T WORK...,I'm out $17 shipping charges. That's after the $5 that they said they'd refund me. I still didn't get that nor my refund for the modem.
5,COMCAST COMPATIBLE MODEM,"GIVEN THE EVER CHANGING COMPATIBILITY ISSUES WITH THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET, IT WAS A PLEASURE TO JUST OPEN THE BOX, PLUG THE MODEM IN AND GET BACK TO WHAT I WAS DOING. THE PRODUCT WAS PROPERLY DOCUMENTED AND WORKED JUST AS INDICATED. A REAL PLUS FOR A USED DEVICE.THANK YOU AGAIN,I'LL BE BACK"
5,Motorola SurfBoard SB5120 modem,Works as well (better) than the modem that you rent from Comcast. The price is reasonable - pays for itself in a few months (rather than renting) - easy to set-up. No problems so far.
5,Perfect Product,"I purchased this modem about 3 weeks ago, and it has been rock solid since. No problems at all. Also, I had no problems registering it with my cable company (Cable One)."
2,Was not as advertised,"I am very disappointed with this modem. Even though it is the same make and model as my previous one, it is slower and the standby switch doesn't work. I will not buy another one from here."
1,Very Displeased,This product arrived in a damaged/unrepaired state. The reset button was broken. The USB cable clip was broken. The most important falt was that after an hour with Comcast Support they could not hook up their browser with the modem. We then had to go through the process of hooking up the old modem to get me back on line. The product had to be returned. This was not a good experience.
4,A pretty good book,"Readers who enjoy sci-fi that isn't entirely alien or highly complicated will probably like this book. Those who prefer the really esoteric sci-fi that really makes you scratch your head should look elsewhere. People who read the two previous books in the series might be dissapointed with chronological advancement of the storyline. The first two books dealt with young idealistic cadets. But this book suddenly and unexpectedly leaps forward. Suddenly our young characters are old grizzled veterans trying to recover from the civil war that was only foreshadowed in the prevous books, also the alien threat which was only briefly touched on in the first two books becomes a central component of the plot. Still the book was fun and exciting, lots of action, and space battles. It also continues with the Heinlein (Starshiptroopers) style social commentary of the first two books."
5,excellent,"This is a good read, if you treat this book on its own and not part of a series,I strongly recommend you read it ...this book has alot good hardcore si/fi some great space power politics and slight continuation on other 2 books with 20 years difference.if you like this book get back to me let me know how you feelthanks"
1,Poor customer service from company,Ordered this item then two days before Christmas the order was cancelled by the 3rd party seller. When I called Amazon they were of no help and referred me to the company. BAD FORM - now who is going to tell my kid that Santa forgot their one and only present.
5,good strengthener,"The red flexbar (light resistance) works very well for me when I bend it upwards; downwards it's a bit too easy, but if I add more reps it helps. I'm using it in the hopes of regaining full strength to a fractured forearm."
2,coogs will never win a Rose Bowl,because they'll *coog it* like they always do under pressure. Losing 5 apple cups in a row is a prime example.
2,Totally baby book,"I got this book thinking that it would be some cool poke'mon book but,it turned out to be a chubby baby book.It's about Charmander seeing a ghost,and pikachu,Slowpoke,and Bellsprout are trying to help find out what the ghost really was.It was REALLY boring.but,it's good for toddlers."
4,300 mg but not odor free,"I ordered this product because I was specifically searching for a Garlic tablet that was 300 mg each. There aren't that many to choose from. This product states ""odor free"". In my opinion that is not accurate. When taking the pill it definitely takes extremely like garlic. I have had odorless garlic pills before (gel caps) and you taste nothing. These leave your mouth tasting of garlic. I will keep looking for ""ordorless"" pills, but until then, this product serves my purpose for the milligrams.Order delivered on time and in brand new condition."
5,Do You Remember Me? by Judith Levine,"Memorable, moving, beautifully written, thought-provoking and informative about many things. Another reviewer said it well, citing family struggles & individual struggles to create compassion and kindness in the face of social and political constraints. The mother and daughter are most heroic in these ongoing struggles."
5,Intimate Memoir,"I felt like I just spent intimate time with the author and her family. I admired the risks she took to be honest. I found the book compelling and compassionate (I cried, chewed my fingernails and looked forward to my nightly hour of reading). I found myself rooting for Ms Levine's dad. So Alzheimers helpedthe author and the reader love her father. Ms. Levine delivered a beautifully written, insightful look into the last few years of her life."
2,Useful reference but only good through 1996,"This was a handy resource to corporate greening up to 1996 when it was published. I still find it useful as a reference but obviously it needs a successor, now that we're in corporate greening 2.0 where climate change has fused ""green"" with ""energy"" and ""sustainability."" It's worth having on the shelf in company libraries, but where it stops, readers will have to go to the Web"
4,Sweets,My daughter raves about this candy bar and they are only available in our area around Halloween so I purchased a box to save for Christmas stockings. Product arrived timely and in good shape. Enjoy...
3,PH Informatics & Information Systems,The edition is a bit old for what has happened in the last 10 yrs in the field of informatics. It is supposed to have a companion PDF file for instructors BUT the editor says it does not exist!
2,lame,"No offense to those interested, but this is a pretty boring topic at times. A lot of the time. But it's probably worth having since it is required for the course. BUT what about Chapter 10 eh? NOWHERE to be found. LameCan it be returned still?!"
5,Sweet,This is one of the best cds ive ever heard by Ritchie along with rockin all night this has his best songs along with a small bio. two in one
2,Not worth keeping,"I bought this book to get quick overview of accounting. I had a hard time pulling the real information out from amongst all the pictures and gimmicks. It looks and feels like an elementary school textbook, complete with the juvenile writing and crude drawings. I was embarassed to take it out in public (shallow, I know!). I felt as though I were being talked down to. I returned the book within 24 hours. This may be good for some, but if you want straight information, try another study guide. This volume was just too frivolous for my needs."
3,"Intro to accounting Concepts, not Accounting","If you don't know the basics of balance sheets, income statements, and cash-flow reports, this might possibly be for you. It provides a good introduction to the highest-level concepts of business financials, so that you can have a meaningful discussion with a CPA when they talk about these concepts and even assets, depreciation, as well as cash vs. accrual and some of the various inventory accounting methods.It doesn't talk at all about T-accounts, general ledgers, or even a chart of accounts, so don't expect this to be even close to getting you to the point where you can keep your own books.Is it for you? It's ""unique"" in its style. Read the other reviews and Look Inside to decide if the story-telling workbook style resonates with you. I found it distracting to read and wouldn't consider it a reference source at all. As others have suggested, it feels like a nice adjunct to a day-long seminar, not a self-study book."
1,How To Get Rich Quick...,"...write pap like this.If you're a real simpleton, not just ignorant or uneducated but an honest-to God simpleton in need of amusement you must have your legal guardian or custodian order this one for you. There are lots of spaces where you can scribble numbers and there are childish drawings to make you chuckle. Oh, and bright colors too! In order to keep your attention. Maybe best of all, it's written for your grade level - remedial. And that's OK because you won't learn anything from this book.People, don't waste your money as I did. One I do recommend is Financial Statements by Thomas Ittelson (list price $15.99 and worth more).By the way, co-author Darrell Mullis has presented over 300 ""phenomenally successful"" seminars, while co-author Judith Orloff helps people ""transform their lives through self-awareness."" I googled both these and found not one word indicating that either of them ever actually taught anyone anything. 'nuff said."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,This book is absolutely fabulous! I have basic accounting skills that I've learned over the years through work or keeping track of my personal finances but I never understood the principles. This book taught me in terms I could understand how to understand accounting and to get me excited to learn about it. I've tried taking an accounting class in college but it put me to sleep within an hour of lecture. Reading the textbook assigned in class was also enough to put me to sleep. I loved this book so much that I'm posting my very first review on Amazon and I bought 4 extra copies to give to my teenaged boys and nephew. I belive this will be a great reference for them when they are ready to learn. I highly recommend this book.
5,"Sorry, this book deserves NO LESS than 5 stars","In college I was a business major and MBA. That was 15 years ago. All through college accounting was my biggest nightmare. I just COULDN'T get it. Finance easy, stats cool, get me in accounting and I was lost.I needed to re-learn the the subject's basics (information that I never really understood in the first place) because of a new business venture. In one week of reading this book, I walked away with a better understanding and a USEABLE undestanding of accounting, far superior to what I was exposed to in college. It just blows my mind!Granted, time and experience may have changed my attitude and abilties toward the subject, but for the first time in my life, I walked away from this book actually liking accounting! For me, that in itself is amazing.......This book would have easily raised my GPA!"
3,Astounding!,"Could you please do the artist a favor and list this album in the proper geographic location. This happens to be a Cental American music from the country of NICARAGUA. I think someone mistook this country for Nigeria. By listing it under Nigeria the album is not getting adequate exposure. I've noticed this error for a long time and hoped that it will be corrected sooner than later. But it didn't happen. I like the music. Thanks, Yume."
1,Horrible! a piece of trash.,"Don't waste your money. Only 13 recipes.CD, casero, realizado en la cocina de casa con personas sin conocimiento de panaderia, fotos desagradables de panes mal bollados,no gaste su dinero, encontrara online mucho mas que 13 recetas y mucho mejor explicadas gratuitamente."
1,Good While It Lasted,"Bought these speakers in March 07, it is now November 07 and the power to the transmitter stopped working. One day it was on, the next off. If this product can't last more than a year, it's not worth it. It was probably used once or twice a week, never put batteries in the speakers, had power outlets outside - the speakers work fine, it's the transmitter that died."
2,Zipconnect Speakers,"Not sure if they're worth the money ($165). Wireless requires 12C batteries, plus AAA for the remote. Can't change songs unless you're near the base (which would be inside); the remote is only for volume. Speaker sound is scratchy when volume is at any level that can be heard outside. For the money, you might be better off buying a less expensive iPod doc and cranking the volume. And, the speakers are HUGE in size; not exactly techno looking for 2008."
2,Not a deal,"Sound stinks. If it weren't for the hastle of returning items I would return these. The only good thing about these is that it's easy to set up. You can't listen to any of your other speakers while you have these plugged in. They go into the headphone outlet of the stereo. I bought these to have additional sound outside. If you have an MP3 player and want to use it for that, it will probably work out better for you. But again the sound isn't all that great."
4,"Good book, but lacking some common repair needs.","I like this book very much. It is very easy to read and use for troubleshooting and replacing parts to your car. There are some things is lacks. Some issues are just not existant in the book and I have to look further. I understood this when I bought the book. (what do you expect for a small book for so cheap?) If you were looking for a full car repair manual for your car. You will need to buy a Helms or similar for about the price of four of this book. Even at that, I would reccomend this book as a companion."
4,it is ok,"it is basic book, do not expect lots of details. it is good for me to have for torcs and basic info"
1,Waste of money,I bought the Haynes Honda Accord 90 - 93 repair manual and I consider it a waste of ($$$) It is written with very little attention to detail and was very confusing. For someone who already knows the ins and outs maybe it is great but for me it is a waste of time. I would not recomend it to anyone. I have not read the other brands so I cannot compare them.
5,Fascinating,"Read about this interesting young lady in the New York Times, and had to buy the book. Written by a pre-teen, the narrative is a breath of fresh air both in its scope and Patience Richard's innocent description and interpretation of the world around her."
4,Charming,"I ordered this book after reading Patience Abbe's obituary. As children, she and her two brothers dictated this memoir to their mother. But as her older brother said years later, it was primarily Patience who had something to say.They grew up not circling the globe, but certainly crossing Europe, back in the 20's and 30's. This is a charming snapshot of a bygone time.Don't look for great writing here, since the wording is from the children. Many non-sequiturs, but that is part of the fun. They paint a rollicking, non-conventional childhood in a bohemian atmosphere.I'm not the quickest reader, but it only took an afternoon or two to finish it. Enjoy!"
5,Screw Pulp Fiction... Pink Flamingos is where it's at!!,"Everybody likes this band because of Pulp Fiction... but what they don't know is that their music(intoxica) was first added into John Waters film Pink Flamingos. Anyway, this is the best surf group(besides the Trashmen) to ever exist and you(reader of this review and friends and family of the reader) should buy this album."
4,Track Listing Correction,"If this is indeed catalog #MPG040, The Damn EP, the correct track listing is as follows:1. Disco Party In The Castle Of Love (Tonight) 2. Echoes Of Pumford (Live Version) 3. Neighborhood Watch (We Call Police) 4. Wizard DudeThere is no tune called ""Damn"" on this CD. It's highly recommended; although none of this stuff is as tight as the best of Extreme Gaming, ""Neighborhood Watch (We Call Police)"" is tremendously funky and the rest of it walks the edge of loopy candy flipper funk without falling in."
5,Adorable!,"Bought this umbrella for my eight year old daughter and she lives it! It's the perfect size, not too small like other kids umbrellas. It's well made and very pretty and bright."
3,Encaustic Bliss,"Michael Bossom has produced a reference publication for the new and experienced encaustic painter.Although a book covereing only a few facets of encaustic paining techniques, they are clearly explained for everyone to follow. From the beginning the reader can feel the passion for encaustics that Michael has in his chosen art form. Not afraid to share the little facts that help a new person to encaustics prepare for the exploration of the encaustic journey, he walks you through the various forms of working with wax.He combines his own exquisite encaustic paintings and then explains in easy to follow detail how to achieve the same sort of result.His almost exclusive use of the encaustic iron and the stylus to produce the magical artwork makes this ancient artform,(some 2,500 years old)mystical and childlike, especially the fantasy elements.The book is a 'must have' for the beginner and a 'I've got it in my art library' for the experienced encaustic painter."
1,THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON ENCAUSTICS I HAVE EVER SEEN.,"THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE ART OF ENCAUSTICS, IT IS ABOUT CHEESE. THE TECHNIQUES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN GLORIFIED SPRAYPAINT ART. THIS BOOK IS AWFUL, SO MUCH SO THAT I HAD TO RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY. SOMEONE TELL ME IF THERE IS A QUALITY BOOK ON THIS SUBJECT."
1,"Very narrow, doesn't do the art form justice.","I own or have read most of the books on encaustic painting. This one is the least helpful, and shows only one technique. Unfortunately, I own this one, which I bought as a beginner. Even as a beginner, I knew it was very simplistic and incomplete, as there are many more techniques that yield much more interesting and artistic results. The paintings in the book lack any of the 3D qualities that encaustics are known for. All the paintings have marks made by the authors iron, using the only technique in the book. You are better off buying any other book on encaustics than this one."
1,Dont get this book.,"Again, this author is a formula painter and this book is devoid of information that will make you a better artist. Beginners: don't start bad habits. Seasoned artists: this is laughable. Please dont waste your money. I bought everything available just to see what might be gleanable, and this was a throwaway."
1,Christian Punk ?!,"The only reason I rated this one is because there is no 0. Punk is music agianst the estableshment, christians are the estableshment"
2,Disappointing,"This book is anything but a ""restores guide"" and contains very little information that cannot be obtained free via the internet.I am in the process of restoring a 1968 Dodge Coronet R/T and wanted detailed information or at the least photos to help me with determining correct finishes and components. NOT IN THIS BOOK.There were two pictures of my particular car and both were front quarter shots, one at a distance, and one showing the front grill.The text reads more like an overview of the history of different B-body models that was compiled from factory ads than from a restorer's perspective. Even the production numbers were not broken down to reflect particular engine/transmission packages.All in all I was extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this book."
3,"Not up to ""Original"" standard","As an owner of two 68 Plymouths I expected a bit more restoration details about the Plymouth ""B"" bodys. The book seems to be more aimed toward the Dodge bodied cars and did not address as muck detail as I expected. I expected more information about the mechanical and electrical detailing of the cars, which would be common between the two makes. All in all the book is ""OK"", but not up to what I have come to expect from the ""Original"" series. This is the 6th ""Original"" series book I have purchased covering my cars, so my review is not meant to say this book is not what it is meant to be, but compared to my other ""Original"" books, this one did not meet my expectations. But if you are also a Mopar fanatic it is worth adding to your library."
2,Awesome but too short.,This is a great cd for the spooky season....Only two songs but still a must for any freaky collection!
5,Essential Reading,"This is a very basic important book for anyone responsible for setting up or designing settings for young children--child care, elementary school, after-school, family day care-- teachers and program managers can benefit from these thoughtful strategies for maximizing the learning potential of classrooms and outdoor spaces. It contains helpful diagrams and maps and provides research-based criteria for set-up and configuration of space and materials that optimize opportunities for children's engagement. Our University Child Care program has based much of its operations on the ideas Kritchevsky, Prescott and Walling develop in this useful publication."
2,Tooo cutesy,"It was too hookey.I guess the themes of today are just not like ""the old days"".No more S T`s for quite a while."
3,Cooker does not contain BPA or Melanine,I am researching this product and found a few reviews that said the cooker contains BPA compounds. If you check the Nordic Ware website - [...] - you will find a comment in the description that the cooker does NOT contain BPA.
1,Recycle # 7,"Had I known it was Recycle # 7 which is frowned upon by environmentalists and health advocates bc. of it's potential to leach into whatever is in it, I would not have purchased this produce. Additionally, the top is comprised of two pieces: the outer lid and an inner lid which fall apart easily. And lastly, the handle latches have become increasingly difficult to snap. My advice... find another rice cooker."
2,"great for veggies, not for rice","Even with half a rice recipe, the water still boils over and makes a mess in the microwave. After several attempts, I gave up and purchased an electric rice cooker. Now I use the Nordic Ware for broccoli, and it works great for that, although it's a little small."
1,Not what I expect from Nordic Ware,I love Nordic Ware products. Except for this one. The latching mechanism is difficult to use and just feels much too tight. I think one of the tabs may break over time. Made in Taiwan which is unusual. Nordic Ware is usually made in USA. The material is not the usual dense heavy weight found in Nordic Ware like the tender cooker but rather it is a lighter weight white plastic. A plus is that it does have the 5 year warranty.
4,Serves its purpose,"I got this rice cooker for free and I was glad to have it after my traditional rice cooker broke. It is basically just a plastic bowl with a strainer and a lid with a vent that can be opened and closed. The quality seems fine to me as I have used it several times and nothing has broken. I find that I always need to add more water and add time to recommendations in the instructions, but once you figure out what works in your microwave its not too hard to adjust accordingly. With that being said, I still think a traditional rice cooker is a better option for cooking rice as there is less room for errors and you can microwave other things (like vegetables) while your rice is cooking. The Nordic Ware rice cooker; however, is cheaper than any traditional rice cooker I've seen and is also great for heating up frozen veggies as you can put the veggies in the strainer. That setup will keep everything moist and allows you to easily remove the unwanted hot water."
4,Perfect Rice Every Time!,"I was skeptical about how good this rice cooker could be when it costs so little. But after some trial and error, and a few revisions to the instructions given in the manual, it makes perfect rice every time now. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the cooking instructions are a bit off. Once you figure out what works best in your microwave, it will give you consistently excellent rice."
4,Pretty good but not perfect,"I think it's pretty good but not perfect. The construction of the lid seems overly complex to me. It makes fine rice, but I'd like to see the lid construction simplified.It does make good rice for me. It took a little experimentation to get it right with my microwave (they all seem a little different)."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This product is made with plastic #7.According to the Microwave-safe plastics, this is not safe: [...] This is what the site says about it:Type 7 - polycarbonate; ""other"" (can contain bisphenol A (BPA); most polycarbonate contains bisphenol A)Do not use in microwave. (Note: Polycarbonate nursing bottles which have been boiled or washed more than 20 times or are badly scratched should be thrown out.)Worse type of plastic you can put in the microwave. HARMFUL! Stay away!"
2,It made a mess!,"I followed all of the directions that came with the cooker to make rice; I got the lid on nice and night, and was really excited to see how it would work, but upon opening my microwave when it finished and beeped, I was greeted with a watery mess. I'm not sure why, but the water had leaked out of the cooker, and all over the bottom of my microwave, which was really disappointing. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 star rating instead of 1 is because despite making a mess, it managed to cook the rice okay."
1,Not at all what I pictured,"This is not an 8 cup rice cooker by any stretch of the imagination. It's very small and may work for 2 people, but I didn't like it so I returned it."
3,"rice is good, but with a strong plastic smell.","I just tried this rice cooker. The result is SO-SO: rice is good, but smells like plastic. So if you can't stand the smell, don't buy it."
3,"Great white rice, does not work for brown rice","If you follow the instructions in the little booklet, your white rice will be perfect. However, your brown rice will not, and even with several adjustments we have not been able to get good brown rice from our cooker. Instead of throwing it out, we have decided that we will just keep it on hand for cooking white rice and nothing else. I had high hopes for being able to make brown rice in it and being able to cut down on the stovetop cooking time for brown rice, but it was not to be.If all you eat is white rice, this is a great product for you. But if you're hoping to make brown rice in it too, save your money."
5,I'm happy with this rice cooker,"I was skeptical about a microwave rice cooker, but this one works great, even for my favorite brown rice."
1,I was disappointed,"I like to make small amounts of rice- this is hard to close, had the water spill all over the microwave even after following the directions closely- Would not recommend- sorry to say"
4,Wonderful!,"I LOVE this pot! I previously owned another Nordic Ware multi-pot but it boiled over every time, so I invested in this one. The locks keep the lid in place and no messes!I can only vouch for the rice cooking of this multi-pot, since that's what I bought it for and that's all I use it for. Multiple times a week. Plus this rice cooker can cook BROWN RICE!"
4,great product,"I've bought 3 now, one for me and one for each of my kids. Makes a bit of a mess (that's the 4 stars - otherwise would be a 5) but a paper towel on a plate underneath solves most of the mess.Does a great job with the rice - always perfect, and goes right in the dishwasher."
1,Does not work,"I bought this based on all of the good reviews it had on Amazon. I tried it several times,(following the directions exactly) and the cooker would not even come close to fully cooking the rice. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Not functional for a large family,The size was too small for a large family. I did not think it would hold 8 cups of rice. But the biggest issue for me was the way to close the lid is too difficult. I own a Microwable Rice Cooker and it is so easy to close the lid.
1,waste of money,"The top didn't fit, wouldn't snap on. No directions to show if I was not doing it right, but what's there to do? Just snap it down. Tried as I could; it wouldn't go on. That's all she wrote. Going back to the store."
2,nordic ware microwave rice cooker,"I was ackward opening and closing, considerating that I have experienced many different appliances this was unit would no recommend at all."
1,This product broke my daughter's microwave,DO NOT PUT THIS PRODUCT IN YOUR MICROWAVE. I bought it for my daughter and her microwave won't function properly and makes funny noises now. If anyone else has had any problems let me know.
2,common since,"I was expecting a more informative read. What this book does, is simply restate common since and information you should already know if you're experienced enough to consider being a mentor."
3,Mentoring is a practical workbook for the first time mentor.,Mentoring by Gordon Shea is a fun read. This book acts like a workbook and is very practical. Mentoring is recommended for any person who is considering a mentorship position either professsionally or personally. I it to be very quick and easy to read. The reader is allowed to reflect on themselves as mentors as well as who they are mentoring. It focuses on gender and age issues that may occur. There are several opportunities for the reader to complete written exercises by themselves as well as in small groups. The strengths of the book included precise to the point lists and recommendations for successful mentoring relationships. The weakness of this book falls on its' lack of in depth information on any topic. This book is a good introduction to mentoring for a first time mentor but not recommended for teachers that have been teaching for some time or have already assumed a mentor position in the past.
3,A good introductory book for the beginning mentor,"This book has many strengths:It is concise and to the point,an easy read. Various scenarios are presented that a mentor might find themselves in, including cross-gender and cross-cultural mentoring.. It has a workbook that is helpful and includes case studies. A couple of weaknessess and that is there isn't a bibliography and it is just an intro. If you really need to learn about the intricascies of mentoring you should consider a more in-depth study."
4,"A concise, no-nonsence book of mentoring techniques","This book is direct in it's approach to effective mentoring. Written in a workbook style, it encourages self analysis while giving concrete examples. The brievity of wording makes this book one which many will actually read. Therefore, this would be an excellent book for an experienced mentor to use in guiding new mentors into the practice. Someone approaching mentoring for the first time could use this book even without the help of an experienced mentor at his side."
5,An Interesting Outlook on the Life of Miles Davis,"""Miles Davis"" by George R. Crisp is a biography on the life of jazz great Miles Davis. This is a well put biography of the life of Miles Davis that also branches of into the lifestyle of many other jazz musicians. This book covers everything from Miles Davis's early childhood, to his move to New York, and to his sad death. Although I disagree with some of the negative comments about certain players, I still enjoyed how clearly and easy to follow the author describes Miles Davis's life and the jazz scene of the time. As a young jazz musician I strongly recommend this book witch is why I rate it a five."
5,Wonderful Book !!!,I recently became a lactation specialist and this book is WONDERFUL !!! Very easy to read and very easy to use when you have issues and questions and need help.
2,Wasn't Pick N' Pluck...,"What I got was a block of foam rubber. It was not ""Pick N' Pluck"". It wasn't worth sending it back."
3,"Good Album, but he's not Bobby",If you're looking for something similar to Bobby Fuller this is not it. If you are a country fan this is a good album.
4,A Good Read,"An interesting look into the mind of the NHL's premier enforcer in the 1970s. Schultz reflects upon his craft with some degree of introspection, and he is somewhat unhappy about his career. Features some controversial (at the time of publication) comments about his teammates. Easy reading, too."
2,Not soft enough,"Product was as shown and described. However, it is too rough for my face. I believe a smaller size would be softer, so that's what I will order next."
3,OK-but expected more,"When I ordered these I was looking for a natural sponge that was soft and also exfoliated in a gentle way. The bath sponge is indeed soft and yummy, but I can't detect much exfoliating going on. Then again, this could just be due to my limited experience with natural sponges - perhaps I should have ordered a different type."
2,"Small, fragile","I ordered the largest size they offer (3.5 to 4 inches). The sponge was much more of an irregular shape than the picture shown here. The four inches is measured from tip-to-tip of the longest possible dimension. Measuring 90 degrees from that, the sponge I got was only about two inches wide.The sponge lasted just six weeks before falling apart. At $13.45 (with shipping) this is way too expensive. You can getLATHER Natural Sea Wool Spongeshipped for $14 and that is huge. You could cut that up to make at least four decent sized sponges considerably larger than this one. (I say four only to be on the conservative side.)While it lasted, though, it was very nice."
5,These Makeup Sponge is Fantastic,I use makeup sponges to put on my base. These sponges are large enough to easily smooth over your face. It is much harder to over-apply your makeup using these sponges. I obsessively keep a few in my makeup drawer so I don't run out. Clean it with soap and water.
2,Too tiny.,"Mine was about 2 inches long. Just way too small for my purposes. 4"" would've done it. 2"" is useless."
1,PURCHASE CAUTIOUSLY IF LOOKING FOR BIG SPONGES,"Put this product in my cart at under $4 per sponge, price was changed after. My fault for not noticing it had changed, but there were a bunch of other items in my cart & I didn't spot it until too late. The sponges I received were tiny. I contacted them for authorization to return, which they gave. Delivery confirmation says they received them back Dec 10th, and here on the 26th they still have not credited my account for the return. If you need a tiny little craft sponge, you might be able to use these things, but if you want a sponge you can use to shower with, go to Target. UPDATE: 12 days after they (Big Deal Beauty) acknowledged receipt, I sent another email. Finally received refund in full. Emails very cryptic and with no explanation or apology, but I did receive the refund."
1,Really Disappointed - not soft at all,These sponges were listed as Natural Silk Sea Sponge that were very soft and they are in fact very rough and not soft at all. I am very very disappointed in this product and would never order this again. I was really looking forward to receiving a very soft sponge as the item had listed.
4,Super,"This book, guide, reference, ... or what ever you name it. is essential for all business, financial and investment guides."
2,"Useful, but there are better books out there","The authors have taken an approach from an accounting or legal standpoint. They haven't included methods incorporating EVA or contingent claims analysis. For as thick as this book is--and it is really thick--there is a surprising lack of detail. If you're looking to value companies of any significant size, buy the McKinsey book instead. If you're going to work with only closely held firms, estates, etc. then perhaps this book is for you."
2,Useful but Boring,"I bought this book long time ago (6-7 years) when I joined a private equity firm and was hungry for materials which taught valuation technique. Materials in this book is useful. In addition,there were few titles which discuss valuation of non-public companies at that time. This book, in fact, was also a reading material for the CFA exam back in 1995. However, the text is quite boring. Unless you really need to study information about valuation for non-public company, don't buy it for leisure"
2,A bit hard to understand,"I had an older edition of this book, which wasn't very helpful, so I bought the new one hoping it was an improvement, but came away rather disappointed because, for an instructional manual, this one is hard to follow. Apparently, the authors have been in the valuation business for a long time, but it's not always easy to translate experience effectively into words. For most, this is a how-to project with potentially big consequences, so the instructions should be more clear than this. I liked ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business"" as an alternative. Once I read that book, I understood better what these guys were talking about."
2,not as clear as I'd hoped,"This book is ok, but you might find ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business"" to easier to follow. On the other hand, if you want a highly technical treatise, look Tuller's book."
4,exceeded my expectations,"Scott Michael Foster stole the show. His character, while very dark and misunderstood is brilliant. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Independent Films and/or if you are a Scott M Foster fan.There a few scenes featuring poetry. The poetry is beautifully written and dramically performed. B+"
4,teen dirtbag purchase 2010,I was very happily overall with the purchase money wise and content wise but the only thing i wasnt happy with is i cant play this dvd on my big flat screen tv every time i did it had a blured pixelated bar down the bottom but on old small tvs it didnt happen.Overall its still an awesome buy
5,Great movie,Movie was in great condition! Fast delivery! I will definitely use amazon again for future purchases!
4,Addictive despite it all,"I came across this movie on a whim, I had no expectations about it. I found it entertianing and suprizingly addictive. There were a lot of things borderline amateurish and undefined about the movie. But despite all the things I could try to say against this movie. The movie makers must have done something right because I still like it enough that I plan to buy it. It aggervates me but at the same time I have watched it about four times within a week. I can't tell you why I keep coming back to it, but I do, and I still react to it everytime. It hasn't gotten boring yet, the parts that were shocking, gross, and sad; the first time around still get to me now. Its by no means a block buster hit, but it has the potential to be a perfect cult movie like The Breakfast Club."
4,Good for Residents,This book is written in a crystal clear mannerShould benefit residents on rotation toa sports medicine facility
5,Mmm....Dry Like A Proper Martini,"Now this is proper dry, black comedy. Dennis Price and Alec Guinness are both delightful in this sly, funny look at murder and love....or at least some lust mixed with proper arch looks."
5,Excellent Movie!,"I just happened onto this movie several years ago on Turner Classic Movie channel and LOVED it. When it finally came out on DVD it was on my ""Must Buy"" list. Alec Guiness is in excellent form, as he plays 8 parts and you can tell he is having fun. The ending is priceless in its simplicity.Dry British humor at its best."
4,Good transfer of an excellent British comedy,"No need to add much to the comments above and below about this excellent post-war (1949) British black comedy, so I'll restrict myself to the DVD.This is a good transfer of a film which is now well over 50 years old. Criterion might have got more out of it, but this release wouldn't do that company any shame.Damage is virtually non-existent, contrast is excellent and the image very sharp. There is an occasional hint of grain, but this is a much better DVD transfer than I was expecting on such an inexpensive disc. Just check out the trailer which is almost indiscernible image-wise to show what a good job they have done.The sound is mono and sounds a little thin at first but Dennis Price's beautiful narration is clear and the ear soon adjusts.All in all, a very good DVD release."
5,Dazzling talent,"Guinness is in top form playing all seven family members (male and female!) who must be assassinated before the cunning protagonist can assume a title. This is a little jewel of a film, often overlooked these days. I think it even better than ""The Lavender Hill Mob."" Joan Greenwood is wonderfully distinct as always. This black comedy is full of wild wit, as when one of Guiness' incarnations is shot down while throwing suffragette leaflets from a hot air balloon: ""I fired an arrow in the air, she fell to earth in Barclay Square!"" Superb fun."
5,"A Perfect Little Gem, Finally Given Its Due","This Ealing comedy represents the apex of British black humor. The presentation is elegant and dry-- the message is completely amoral-- and the film is outrageously funny from beginning to end.The story is about murder, serial murder, and our protagonist is the one who's killing innocent people. But we WANT him to succeed, and rejoice in his every evil. His cruel seductions and black homicidal perfidy make him an oddly sympathetic character, and Dennis Price's performance is, well, priceless.Then you've got Alec Guinness (whose name can be anagrammatized as ""Genuine Class"") mostly underacting as a procession of stuffed-shirt (and blouse) British aristocratic boobs, all of whom are imaginatively murdered. Guinness is at his best here (and the documentary/interview with him that's included is further evidence of his quiet genius as an actor).This classic little jewel bears repeated viewings, and well deserves the Criterion treatment-- Bravo!"
4,Nice film.,"An interesting example of the Ealing films of the 1940-50's. Of course, it's most well known for Alec Guinness playing all eight ill-fated members of the same family.I can't understand what makes it so overwhelmingly popular now, as it wasn't widely available on videotape even a few years ago. Still, pleased to see it's gaining in appreciation with every passing day."
3,New book on Salvias,Found the book interesting but limited since it was written promarily for the US gardener. Would have appreciated more illustrations. Nevertheless a worthwhile addition to the library.
3,Cold hard facts?,"My son is 13 months old, and has always been an enthusiastic, active (perhaps gymnastic is a better word) nurser. His first year of life had a few rough spots, but was mostly pretty hassle free. Since I now realize that some good facts would have stood me in good stead in that first year, I was hoping to head off any problems for the second year by reading this book. Specifically, I was looking for information about how much time/how many times a day he would nurse at different ages, information about maintaining a supply during business trips, etc. Although the book was fascinating, it didn't seem to have the sort of cold hard facts I was looking for, especially those relating to working moms. My advice: Go to a League meeting or talk to a League Leader."
4,A good pat on the back,"Living as I do far from support groups, I found this book helpful in combating the feeling of being alone. It was great to hear other mother's stories--not just the good, but the troubles and difficulties as well."
1,I would NOT recommend this book for any working mother...,"Disjointed, disorganized, and disapproving are the words that best describe ""Mothering Your Nursing Toddler"". It's chapters are reiterations of the same lecture over and over again - and the lecture basically states that if you are a working mother, you can't possibly breastfeed. Pardon me, but I've worked full time since my kids were 3 months old. I'm nursing a 2 year old and just let my 4 year old self wean. That's FAR longer than any stay at home mother I know!In my travels have seen references to studies that show that working and pumping mothers nurse LONGER than stay at home mothers. Maybe Ms. Bumgarner should do a little more research next time."
2,It's ok,"I was a little disappointed. There were a few tidbits that I liked but other than that, nothing I didn't know. Kind of a ""preaching to the choir"" kind of book in my opinion."
2,Boring,"This book just wasn't helpful. I am nursing a toddler, i thought the book was too technical. I didn't learn any new information from the book. In my opinion there wasn't any info about mothering."
3,A family fan,"Bought this DVD, because my brother is the guy who gets blown up, in the opening scene! No really - he's my real brother! If we ever have an argument- I can always put in the film, real quick, and see him go boom! LOL Love him dearly!"
5,Our new favorite CD!,"This is by far one of the most fun, clever children's CD's I have had the pleasure of listening to! I love the use of non-traditional instruments and it's message to children to find their own beats and make their own music. The songs are catchy and I find myself forgetting to turn off the CD - even when my son is not in the car. So far, all of my other friends with children have asked for his name and went on to purchase copies of their own. I think anyone who is looking for fun, non-traditional, folksie kids music will fall in love with this CD. I love it!"
4,Mountain meadows without the extra jargon from non-participants,"This book covers the events of the infamous Mountain Meadows massacre concisely as the memory of John D. Lee permits. Although it doesn't carry such an alluring title as ""Mormonism Unveiled,"" it carries much more about the man himself in conjunction with the dreaded events of 1857. It carries no extra input to solidify the case either for or against the church as a whole. If it's history you're after, and not manufactured melodrama, then this is a great read."
3,Good toy for drum enthusiasts who want to learn,"I love drums and rythim so I decided to learn how to play drums. I decided to buy something not to expensive nor too big so that it would not became a problem if I got disappointed during the learning process. Well, I have this set for one month now and I'm satisfied with it and it had served it purpose which is to initiate myself in the art of drumming. However, I must warn you, it's a toy, do not be fool by it having pedals and all, the product will not give you the real feeling that more professional drum sets can give. I'm already thinking about buying a serious equipment, but it won't be until I finished my basic learning phase"
2,First thoughts,"WEll I have to be honest...I thought this would be way cooler than it is. I got it for Christmas, and.....I don't know, we'll see. The problem is the sounds aren't very real (especially the cymbals,) and the pedal doesn't react properly. Sometimes I click down on it with no reaction. Sometimes it triggers too early or twice. If it weren't for the pedal though, I would think this was okay...I plan on trying it out on MIDI really soon and seeing about having it trigger my propellerhead reason samples. But so far this isn't as cool as I was hoping it would be."
4,This is a lot of fun!,"We set up a music studio for friends and family to enjoy (instead of all that TV and movie time). This instrument offers an opportunity for others, who may not have an instrument, to join the fun! When it is plugged into the PA it has a ""real"" sound. I'm gradually learning what it can do, and I've even bought a book of how to play the drum. It's a worthy instrument for our studio."
3,"It plays great, but cymbals cut out early...","It plays great! I use it, plus a predecessor of it, at my brother's place, in band practice.My only complaint about it is that, when I am playing, and use the ""crash cymbals"" for emphasis, then keep playing, the ""crash"" almost immediately cuts out. I don't think ""The predecessor"" cuts out like this.(I can't remember the number, but it is a Yamaha. I got it at Costco)Also, the top-right pad can hardly be heard. I have this same problem with the predecessor.However, all-in-all, it's a good product!!!"
4,Great price for good product!,"This set it good for the great price. I use it for recording only and I noticed that the sensitivity level seems to be poor through midi, but that is only for the snare drum. If you plan to use this live it sounds good and feels good except for the pedals which feel like keyboard sustain pedals. I use it with Toontrack's EZdrummer and it was basically set except I had to edit the high-hat. I feel that this is good for my small recording studio and it can be good for a young drummer trying not to annoy neighbors but not wanting to fork out $1500 for a good set. If you want to make it better you can buy the kp65 and buy a pedal and that is pretty good, but I have yet to try that high-hat pedals."
4,Bass and Hihat,"Is there a way to connect a Bass pedal or a Hihat pedal from another Electric drumset? I have had this Dd55 for around 10 years, And both pedals are messing up, But I dont want to spend the money to buy another Dd55, Does anyone have any Ideas? Stanley"
4,Great songs!,"On this disk you will find traditional folk songs sung by the Chilean group Los Cuatro Hermanos Silva. I teach Spanish at a community college and my Spanish students enjoyed the songs ""Si vas para Chile"" and ""Yo vendo unos ojos negros."" The lyrics are easy to follow and the students loved the two songs mentioned above."
1,Could not be made cheaper!,"I used this ring board 2 to 3 times weekly and after less than 2 months of use, the clamping mechanism failed.It is outside the return window and it is not worth the shipping charge to return it. I grant you it is a small burn, but a burn none-the-less.Look elsewhere for a ringboard."
3,Decent puzzle book,"I bought this puzzle book for my 2 year old son. Some of the puzzles are a bit challenging because they don't have a lot of picture and color, but he can usually do them with a little help. Now that he has done some of them a few times, he can do those on his own. The pieces are a little thinner than I would like. We keep the plastic sleeves on to make sure the pieces don't fall out. They do seem to be in there pretty tight though. I'm on the fence about a repeat purchase."
2,lost in translation,I read this particular book believing it would be a history of the airplane and submarine developement. The further i read thr more mundane it became to me. It did not explain the grass roots of how either were developed. I like specific construction criteria from prototype to new modern examples. I found this to be lacking in specifics like that to really keep my interest.
1,Why bother?,"What's the use of having a DVD with no extras? Knowing Fox, they're probably waiting to see if it picks up cult status and then will release a special Collectors Edition. Regardless, the fact that the UK version got all the extras and the US version got none means this is only worth a rental in my opinion."
4,a doze of british humor,"super funny and smart...Simon Pegg is hilarious, one of my favorite brits of all time to watch. cool and unpretentious"
2,Is this supposed to be funny?,"Hollywood's sense of humor has really gone down the toilet in recent years, but How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is a new low. For whatever reason, the movie just doesn't doesn't get the humor right. It's not that the jokes themselves are horrible, but they're not great. Even worse is the execution. The jokes fall flat. I think it's partly Simon Pegg. He's not a horrible actor, but isn't funny. The final result comes across as amateurish.I gave the film 2 stars rather than just one for two reasons. First, Megan Fox actually adds some real humor - and is smoking hot! She plays the ditzy American actress perfectly. Second, there is one scene when the dog dies that is hilarious. It's not funny because the dog dies, but rather because it plays on conventional tropes in American comedy in which somebody throws a fall out the window and the dog jumps after it. I did laugh out loud at that one. Unfortunately, that's the only time I laughed out loud."
4,SOMEWHAT GOOD,"Based on the memoirs of Toby Young of a similar title. This tale follows a small time British writer (Simon Pegg) who trashes the stars and a following incident gets him invited to a big magazine run by one of his heroes (Jeff Bridges)which then forces him to be nicer to the Hollywood celebrities. Along the way he falls for one celebrity (Megan Fox)but seems to get far better on with a fellow female journalist (Kirsten Dunst). It's a light comedy with some funny moments but not rip roaring ones. The love story is painfully predictable but Hollywood has learned that a lot of moviegoers want it that way so it stays that way for a reason. They did a better job than I expected in showing why the main character was so caught up in getting into the ""A class"" crowd but sort of dropped the ball once he got into it. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HUMOR: B minus; SHOWS THE HOLLYWOOD SUBCULTURE WELL: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: early January 2012."
4,There are bonus features,"Not sure what edition you're looking at, but the DVD I have has Commentary with Robert Weide and Simon PeggCommentary with Robert Weide. There's also a nearly 19 minute behind the scenes special with interviews with the cast and Weide.Shame the deleted scenes, gag reel and Pegg's Blog didn't make it over. But it's not barebones."
2,Cheap Jokes,"This film used all of the lame over-the-top humour that some people can't get enough of (The Hangover). One reviewer wrote how you could skip the first 45 min and last 30 min and miss nothing, I say watch the first and last ten minutes and that's all-folks. The character is most obnoxious, and not in a smart way, just useless humour. I used it as background noise while I painted my nails, and waited for them to dry."
4,Better than I Thought it would be,"the acting was very good, the plot line was believable and funny, simon pegg is i think better in this movie than shaun of the dead and hot fuzz even though the humor is rather similar. several laughs throughout, megan fox looks awesome, jeff bridges is funny (the voice reminds you of the big lebowski but of course not as priceless)...and the movie has a cute ironic ending...which we don't have enough of in comedies..."
4,Its ok,"Sydney White, a British journalist, who is extremely clumsy and a hell of an idiot, tried all his life to enter the celebrity world because he thought it is great and will make him very happy. He gets hired by a big firm in NYC called Sharp, which he can't help but continue acting like a total idiot around its staff and the celebrities. He then meets Megan Fox and feels very attracted to her. At the same time he is always annoying his colleague, whom in the end falls in love with her.A chick flick movie, with some stupid funny jokes"
2,"I didn't get to watch it – rental warning, Amazon sucks",I didn't get to watch it due to not getting a fast enough internet connection in time. Apparently it requires a hefty connection – FYI for if you're planning to rent.
4,A Life of Integrity,"A wonderful book, by one of the more renowned Holy Men in the Native American Community. ""Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power"" offers native wisdom and love. He offers ways to become a living ""Hollow Bone"" for Great Spirit's Healing Energy. But he states in many ways the importance of all teachers to live a life of integrity. I borrowed from his example in my chapter: The Tao of Not Following in my book, The Wheel of Initiation.Wheel of Initiation: Practices for Releasing Your Inner LightI appreciate the warnings and guidance he gives for anyone seeking or providing spiritual healing."
2,inconsistent and somewhat hard to believe,"Fools Crow Wisdom and Power is interesting in that the memoir is an account of a Sioux ""holy"" man. Yet, Fools Crow's holiness is not consistent. He has some good ideas about general spirituality but this is more of a plea for the Native American movement.I read it for a graduate class in religion but was disappointed."
1,"20 Tangos Clasicos-Viva Gardel,Vol.1","This cd is song by another person, not by Gardel. This can be verified hearing anyone of the songs."
4,"""20 Tangos Clasicos-Viva Gardel, Vol. 1""","I Agree with the reviewer from San Juan. This artist(s) does not appear to be Carlos Gardel. However the style is similar, and for aficionados of Gardel, of his style, and of romantic traditional tangos, I believe this album would be most enjoyable."
2,How thick is this?!,"The product is good, like all 3M stuff. However this 2D image is paired with all dimensions EXCEPT thickness. I have used this product before, but it was a substantial disc as opposed to this 1/4"" thick wheel. I suppose I have to attribute my disappointment here to my own naivety, but it is frustrating to find that the actual 3M sticker on product includes the thickness measurement while the distributors have decided to leave that out and offer only an uninformative 2D picture which tells me that they are being intentionally misleading!"
5,Extraordinary,"Haruf has a way with words, mostly because he doesn't waste them. Every sentence is so well crafted that you don't realize that someone actually wrote it--it just ""is."" Rarely have I found an author's voice so perfectly matched to his material. Highly recommended."
3,"An okay first novel, but later ones are much better","Set typically for Haruf on the High Plains of Colorado, this is his first novel. It tells the sad story of mean-spirited Sanders Roscoe, his son Lyman, and his daughter Edith. Poor Edith--she is the one who bears the brunt, for her entire life, of the cruelty of this very disfunctional clan. But Edith never really tries to help herself, and consequently loses some of our sympathy. Stylistically, the book is excellent, but the characters are just so nasty that for me, I lost interest in them."
1,Not his best work,"This book was a struggle to complete. One must remain committed to the task. I could readily relate to characters and the region, having been raised on the high plains. While it is flattering to see the home country show up in print, it disappoints when compared to Haruf's ""Plainsong"" or Tom McNeal's ""Goodnight, Nebraska"". I will read other Haruf's works, but this is not one that I would consider a keeper."
5,The Tie that Binds will move you,"Especially if your background or your family's heritage is from our country's heartland. It is unbelieveable to me that this is Ken Haruf's first novel. These customers are alive, full of passion with tremendous emotion and humor."
1,Discouraged by Style,"I read three pages before consigning this book to the give-away bin.I found those pages to contain pretentious literary gimmickery, which I detest."
4,You FELT the emotions of this book...,"The author did a great job of conveying the frustration and loneliness of the characters. The voice of the story-teller was hard to follow occasionally, but overall I would encourage the reading of this book."
3,The Tie That Binds,"Because I love Haruf's writing. However, I didn‘t think this book was as good as his others. I found the main theme depressing without the interjection of humor or much relief that usually comes in his books,e.g. ""Plain song"""
4,Like a flower slowly blooming,"The slow pace of this novel works not only to create a sense of the unhurried, methodical, sometimes monotonous lifestyle of rural farm families in Holt, Colorado, but also serves to let the pieces of a mystery slowly unfold with each chapter. The story of Edith Goodnough, accused of murder, is told from a neighbor's point of view, and the narrative voice is in no hurry to get to the heart of the details of the supposed murder, yet manages to divulge and foreshadow enough information to keep the reader's attention piqued."
4,homespun tale with vivid character sketches,"The slow pace of this book was at times a struggle, but after having completed the novel, I now appreciate the tone and speed of this novel, the gentle unwinding of the characters and their experiences. What kept me intrigued was the mystery ending of finding out WHO and WHY Edith killed. I enjoyed reading the character's journey, struggles and triumphs. I hated some of the characters and LOVED some of the characters. There were some vivid, gory descriptions including the farm accident in the first 1/4 of the book. I think that Haruf captivated the emotions of his characters and lures the reader in - I couldn't put the book down for the entire last half."
2,Not up to PLAINSONG standard,"I loved PLAINSONG but I don't agree with others here that this novel matches it. Someone mentioned it being slow and that's the key phrase. Whew! There are some real and painful truths here, but getting to them was monotonous for me."
4,Wonderful Gift For New Dad!,"On the recommendation from a co-worker, I bought this for my nephew, a first time Dad; along with great basic parenting tips, it is just hilarious! Written with such great humor, and some touching moments. Since I have two teen boys I can relate to the ""Cain and Abel"" analogy. Hope to hear more about this lively family in the future!"
5,Great for the history buff!,"This series is great for those who enjoy history of family life through the generations. It doesn't talk that much about any political issues going on, but more of what was going on in the home & the roles everyone had. The family in this series was very enjoyable to watch in that they had a good attitude about the adjustments they had to make. Unlike Frontier House & Colonial House where the families were annoying to listen too. In the 1940's House, the family is very ethusiastic about the experience. A couple of weeks into the project they do get frustrated with the lack of technology, but they don't let that get in the way of keeping the spirts up. This I think, keeps it very enjoyable to watch. 3hrs of time well spent!"
5,These guys jam!,"Awesome ""Old school"" metal but doesn't sound outdated. If you like Iron Maiden you will love these guys. Great guitars and the vocalist sounds like Bruce Dickinson. Very well done, I think these guys will be big time if they stay professional and not mess around with booze or drugs. Also, do a search and find their new CD Minions of Metal - it's great stuff."
5,This book is right on target! Women will love it!,"Finally a book that gives a balanced perspective on men and women in marriage. It is so right on! Burke's understanding of women, what makes them tick and what annoys them is delivered with alot of honesty and a touch of humor. He ignores the political correct views of modern culture and give men and women practical advice they can put into practice the day the read the book. Must read as far as I'm concerned! The forward by Howard Hendricks is also worth the price of the book."
3,Different By Design,I did not read all of it. I am a widow and have already had a great marriage. You can't beat God;s Plan!
2,No way to clean..,"I got this feeder from Target about one year ago because it is the cheapest feeder that I can got in my area. It did its job well until several months later when I found out there were several colonies of mold grew in its red chamber.Since its chamber is sealed, I can only try to clean those mold from the hole on top. Well, even with the tiny brush, I still could not reach every conner that is molded.... It would take about 5-10 mins for me to clean it every time, and still can not clean it 100%."
1,Leaked after two weeks,"This hummingbird feeder looked good, seemed to be built well, had an ant moat and a wonderful mounting loop. After two weeks in service it was crawling with bees. They drained it dry. Upon inspection it was obvious that the joint on the top and bottom halves of the feeding station portion of the feeder had not been glued or sealed properly. The bees were drinking the nectar from that leaking joint. I'll try re-gluing the joint. Very disappointing."
4,Love this little cart,"This is exactly as it seems. It's the perfect little wine cart. My husband put it together quickly & easily. The little drawer is perfect for an opener and spout. The only reason I rate it 4 instead of 5 is my larger red wine glasses have a wider base than normal glasses and they don't fit in the rack but my normal red glasses fit fine. Love this rack, so cute."
1,A THOROUGH DISAPPOINTMENT,"I bought this CD hoping for the original version of 'Al Di La' which included the opening verse, not the truncated version offered in so many other greatest hits packages. These, however, are re-recordings made in possibly the early seventies. The sound has a tremendous amount of echo which leads me to believe they may be mono recordings re-engineered in fake stereo. A female chorus has been (annoyingly) added to many of these songs and the tempi are considerably slower than the originals No liner notes whatsoever to indicate where or when these recordings were made. Best place to find the original 'Al Di La'? Eric 11509-2 (Hard To Find 45's On CD, Vol.5) or Rhino R2 72577 (Eh, Paisano 100% Italian-American Classics)"
2,An A+ Bike Made By A D- Company,"There was a defective bolt connecting a critical component in the package of nuts, washers and bolts shipped with the bike. Gone are the days when companies sent extra hardware! After nine days, four telephone calls and two e-mails, I finally received the proper bolt. During those nine days while Lamar Fitness made one misstep after another, I obtained a facsimile bolt from a local hardware store, allowing me to use the bike. The bolt had to be tightened after every use of the machine, but it was at least a serviceable solution. During all this, Lamar Fitness never seemed to grasp my frustration. This is not an inexpensive machine, albeit a very solidly built one. I'm happy with the bike, but I would never buy another piece of Lamar Fitness equipment."
5,"Like ""Alias"" only better","It's better than ""Alias"" because it makes sense.Margo Scott wakes up at midnight unable to remember the past month. But she has assassin-like skills and knowledge and is afraid of what she might be. Jake Wise is a government agent. He's taken a leave of absence to do a favor for his former boss and mentor, Frank Temple.Frank has Jake watching Margo but won't tell him why - it's a need to know thing. Jake decides to get to the bottom of it. He manages to ""accidentally"" meet Margo. When Frank is brutally murdered, the evidence points to Margo. She can't remember anything but thinks it's possible she did it . . . and did worse things.The worse things may be why ruthless assassins are trying to kill her. Jake and Margo form an uneasy alliance to uncover the truth.Great suspense, excellent action, complicated plot that comes together with a satisfying resolution, the characters made sense, sexual tension very well done and a hero to die for. I liked everything about this book."
4,Refreshing heroine/hero interaction,"This was my first book by Annie Solomon. I wasn't disappointed. There were so many twists and turns to the plot and I was constantly kept guessing. I loved Margo and Jake together, neither one of them willing to give to much of themselves and yet pressing the other to give more. It isn't often that we get to read about a kick ass female agent, so this was refreshing for me."
3,An OK guide,"This guide is a good one considering how hard making a strategy guide is for this kind of game. It has a very complete walkthrough. It is kind of tiring to flip back and forth in the book though. If you want a guide to help you through the tough parts of the game, get this."
4,not in-depth,"this is the best kind of stratagy guide available. it has everything you need to complete the game without giving everything away. In the back of it, it has a bestiary and a armory but it doesn't give a full explanation, like if a item is cursed. altogether it is my favorite BG strategy guide"
2,"incomplete, scattered and of very little use",the book while touching on most things in the game does not go into the nuts and bolts of the game. While it tells you in coordinate systems where areas are it does not tell you how to reach these coordinates. It is way to general in scope.
1,Don't buy this book,As soon as I bought this book I regretted it because I found a free website that is MUCH better. The book gives a few hints here and there and helps out on certain stuff.
1,This books is totally lame!,"My god, I'm ashamed that amazon even sells this book when you basically get the same thing when you buy the game.Its nothing but fase advertisement and extorsion!YOUR ALL LOSERS!"
1,Strategy i think not,I wanted to get this book to teach me about all of the sub quest's and where all of the magical items are. This book failed to do either. I have learned a lot more for free on the internet. Use the internet my friend use the internet!
1,Very incomplete,"This book doesn't even come close to giving away all the Baldur's Gate secrets. It seems as though it tries to help guide you without giving away too much. To me that defeats the purpose of a strategy guide. In my opinion, a strategy guide should list ALL the treasures, ALL the traps, ALL the hidden items, ALL the subplots, etc. This book doesn't, and I felt it was a waste of money. I found better strategy guides on the web."
1,A Terrible Product from a Usually Reliable Publisher,"Pathetic. Awful. A Waste of Money. That pretty much covers my feelings about this guide. The amount of space given over to, essentially, a verbatim reprint of the game manual was ridiculous. What new information did make it into the book was of little value; save your $20 and check the web for much better hint sites."
1,How to make a BG OFFICIAL strategy guide...,1. Copy 100 pages from the game manual for those who pirated the game 2. Add background images 3. Play the game without finding everyting 4. Write what you saw 5. Get rich.
4,"Allows you to ""cheat"" as much, or as little, as you want!","This is an excellent guide! It has basically three different levels of ""aid"" that you can utilize as you play BG. You can get a general feel for the game and how it should go with the walk-through, you can learn about some of the less obvious missions that you might otherwise miss in the second section, and the third section reveals answers to riddles and how to kill various monsters. But there is still a ton of stuff the guide doesn't mention that you can discover on your own. I found this extremely helpful, and didn't think that it ruined the game at all."
3,Beware of False Advertising!!!,"Well, the strategy guide is OK, but it isn't anything like it is supposed to be! In the back of the Baldur's Gate game manual, there is an ad for the guide. The ad says there are monster lists, item lists, etc. NOT THERE!!! This isn't worth $15-20!"
1,WASTE of TIME and MONEY,"Horrible book, it was actually misleading. The book had to have been published before the release becase the crappy maps that it did have were wrong. The information was incorrect, and I found it to be nothing more than very expensive toilet paper. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I recomend you avoid other books by this publisher, they should have never of let this one hit the shelves."
3,"No town maps,monster statistics,NPC locations,or secrets","This ""official"" guide is basically good for expanding the story line and is good interesting reading. It shows the sequence of general areas/quests to be undertaken, and some NPC info. However, No detailed town maps showing description of buildings and who is in them, no tips/strategy/warnings on how to fight monsters or NPC's, no locations for secret or hidden items such as Ankheg armor, no ""difficulty"" rating of various areas. I used the internet chat rooms to get real info on this game."
1,A very bad guide for a very good game,I'm sorry I bought it. A lot of its content can be found in the user manual. The addition infos contain a walk through and an uncomplete list of sub quests.
1,Dont waste your money or time,This is far from a hint or tips book. Most info seems to be copied right from the BG manual and the maps are wrong and have wrong names for caption. No useful info in here. I feel ripped off and want my money back.
3,The Book is ok but it has mistakes and is incomplete.,"I played the game thru 2 times and found the book to have some very bad and missleading mistakes, the map of the world has travel lines to and from places (cloakwood forest) that are wrong. The pictures associated with some of the discriptions are the wrong pictures, and many of the people and places you can go or meet in the game are not mentioned at all. Where to find items, no. If you follow the story guild your game will not even go quite the same way. I recommed using the book as just a general guide and not expect it to be correct in many areas. Thank-you Wizardaire"
1,One of the worst hint books I have used.,"A hint book is to provide useful information. This book uses a ""diary"" format with vague references to things to do and get. Maps are virtually non-existent. There are no lists of weapons, armor or special items. Worthless."
2,This book is okay... If you lost your game manual.,"This book is incredibly bad. Its mostly just the manual reprinted. Under the character section I didn't find how to make a good character, I found the exact same descriptions used in the game. People say this book is good because it doesn't hold your hand. This book just pretends your inept. The ""walkthrough"" was mostly the exaact same stuff that your journal gives you, with the other being the decisions that the person who played the game made.It just tells you some of what you need to know to beat teh game, and the rest it jsut hints at. The guide just names the side-quests, it doens't help with any of them, also everything is piled around so that you don't have a cohesive, chapter by game chapter guide, rather parts of the chapter all over the book. For crying out-loud, they made two seperate walkthroughs, neither of which is very helpful.Save your money, because this book is just an expensive manual."
1,Just Awful,"Quite frankly the only truly useful thing in this book is one page where is shows the area numbers for all the maps. So I threw it in the recycle bin this morning.It doesn't show hit points of enemies or any of the statistical figures or descriptions of where to find things you regularly expect from such guides. The walkthrough is completely lame and what info there is, is diffcult to find.I recommend you head to gamespot.com to check out Dessloch's guide to BG. It's about 1/3 the price and has absolutely everthing you could want. Also useful is strategy info on websites linked from the BG page.Don't waste your money on this guide."
1,Tripe,"This was without a doubt the worst strategy guide I have ever had the displeasure of laying eyes on. Not only is it poorly written, and organized, but it doesn't elaborate on any of the items, quests or sub-quests mentioned in it. The best they offer on any sub-quest is a two to three sentance blurb. Curious about a magical item? Continue to be, for this book won't help you out. If anyone wants to write a strategy guide they should look to Prima's Diablo (the original Diablo) guide. That was without a doubt, the best guide I have seen out there."
2,I agree with John Ciko,"I use stategy guides to answer specific questions about games, items, and quests. This book is almost worthless. The maps and diagrams are too small to read and have no labels on any of the streets, buildings, or points of interest. At least one of the diagrams is of the wrong part of town. Many of the subquests are omitted and the ones that are included consist of one descriptive sentence. The book has no logical organization for finding anything. I have spent hours looking for some information on some aspect of the game without success or with very limited success. This is probably the most frustrating ""Strategy Guide"" that I own. I agree with John Ciko's review that much better information is available on the Internet."
2,"Hey, this was in Japanese, not English...","My intent was to buy the video games soundtrack. But instead I got this! which is a verbal description of what i assume are Lineage scenes in the game. I say, ""I assume"", because the CD was in Japanese! I couldn't understood a word of it... Guess I didn't read the description well enough before I bought it. Hard to say good or bad because I didn't realize this was an audio drama in japanese lol."
2,Beautiful but repetitive,"This movie definitely has some excellent cinematography and beautiful landscapes in the scenery, but I found it very boring. It seems that for half of the movie all that is going on is people are walking down the mountain then back up with water, then repeat. The drama unfolds with some slow motion shots of people almost tripping and/or spilling the water. I have to say there are some intriguing moments though. If you must see this movie, I would recommend the box set 'Beautiful Women of China'. For a few dollars more it includes this movie, Ju-Dou, and Life Show. Please note that as in the Ju-Dou individual DVD reviews, the video transfer quality is sub-par for Ju-Dou in the box set as well."
3,That's a Spicy Meatball!,"I bought this to use in vegetable juices that need a little kick. The heat is strong and takes some experimentation to figure out how much to use in the beginning while you build a tolerance.The flavor, however, is somewhat strange. The essential oil from the peppers is disolved in alcohol and the alcohol has a taste and smell. I didn't notice this as much when I tried it in a warmer dish but it was mildly offputting in cold raw vegetable juice. My idea was to get the benefits of the capsicum without the pepper flavor but I think I would prefer that to this strange oil/alcohol taste.All in all I'm going to keep using it but probably not as I originally intended."
3,"Not very strong, tastes bad","I bought this to mix into an analgesic cream and it works okay for that purpose. However, this is not a very strong concentration. If I were buying this for a daily supplement, I'd look for something different simply becuase it's not very strong.Also, for anyone wanting to use this for cooking, it is comletely unacceptable. There is a strong medicine taste--it's not alcohol and not pepperss. I have no idea what it is, but it tastes like liquid vitamins that my mother forced down my throat as a kid."
3,"Fabulous idea, poor quality","My son just received this book for his second birthday. It was his favorite present right out of the package. It is SOOOO soft and cute. He started hugging and kissing it and mooing at it immediately. Unfortunately, the ""moo"" button plain old doesn't work. We couldn't get a peep out of it. But, after reading the reviews here I see it's a common problem so I don't think I'll go to the trouble of exchanging it. We can live with out the Moo but this would be a five star product if it worked!"
2,Broken Mooer,"I must echo the review of RJ Moya. We have gone through THREE of these books already. My daughter loved this book as an infant, and it taught her that cows go MOO--one of her first vocalizations (with identifiable purpose), but the mooer broke within weeks. My daughter cried rivers when we pressed the button and no moo sound came out. We took responsibility though because we really did use it a lot. The second book's mooer, however, died within two days. My daughter was once again heartbroken, so we returned the book and tried it for a third time. This one held in there for a little while, but the mooer died two days ago, and I'm OUT! At 17 months, it's no longer her favorite book, and she doesn't seem to miss it at all. I only gave it two stars because she did love it while it lasted. Quite frankly, I'd stay away from it altogether!"
2,Book is defective,"This would be a great baby book, but mine arrived with the printing on the cloth pages in the wrong order! It should say ""I'm your very own COW, and I like to go MOO!"" Mine says, ""I'm your very own COW, So true I do!"" This ruined my gift for my nephew. Has anyone else checked their words to make sure they're right? I'd imagine they printed a whole bunch like this. I'm very disappointed!"
5,Cute!!!!,"Very soft, plush in its very own plastic carry case. A perfect book for my year-old grandson!"
5,moo cow makes life easier,"My 16-month old loves Moo Cow. It's cute, sweet, and quite cuddly. My son learned to push the moo button inside and he's very proud of that accomplishment. As an added bonus, after fighting every evening to get my son's teeth brushed, one day he picked up a toothbrush and ""brushed"" the cow's teeth inside the ""cover"" of this book. That led him to letting me brush HIS teeth and then he brushed his own. That alone was worth the price of the book!"
2,Broken MOO!,"This book is super cute. Too bad it came with a broken MOO right out of the box. It gives this odd scratchy noise instead. Too bad because it's such a fun idea. Oh well, at least my 7 month old granddaughter doesn't know how it really should sound."
2,Lie Groups on Kindle,"This review is for the Kindle edition. I have the hard copy, which I like, and downloaded a sample Kindle version, which I do not like. The Kindle edition occasionally breaks words up; sometimes, more than once per word. While not a deal breaker, editing should be better. The big problems are equations and italics. The equation characters, particularly exponents, are sometimes difficult to identify because they are not fully rendered, and the issue is not with the Kindle. I have a Kindle DX, and expanding the font size does not correct the problem. Missing segments remain missing. Italics have the same problem along slants."
2,Distracting focus on examples,"I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley who used this book for an introductory course in Lie theory.I found that Hall's book focuses too much on examples, often allowing the reader to lose sight of the underlying algebra. In the midst of hacking and slashing one's way through matrix computations, one fails to gain a deeper, and more valuable intuition for what Lie groups and Lie algebras are.My classmates discovered and took a liking toFulton and Harris. I wound up usingHumphreys. Humphreys suffers the opposite failing, of being overly sparse and direct, but it succeeds in conveying an appreciation for the elegance of Lie algebras."
1,Horrible,"It doesn't take a lot of intelligence to figureout how to present lie algebras and lie groupsif you are going to take the matrix route.Namely, you give lots of concrete examples(requiring nothing more than calculus asbackground) and then just state what the generalcase is. In this book, the author uselessly dragsthe uninitiated through swamps of archaic notation(save that for the real thing) and incompleteproofs (where invariably the hard parts are just quoted)so that you have to wonder what in the world is the pointof committing this mess to paper. It is ironic that thevery same publisher already has better books out on exactlythe same topics. Finally, if this really were an introductionyou wouldn't have to add 'elementary' to the title - so let'scall a spade a spade and leave the spin to the politicians."
1,color ink cartridge,The color from the compatible Dell color ink cartridge 7Y74. Was poor in quality. I would only purchase that cartridge from Dell when I need it again.
2,Cyber-schlock - with a few good ideas,"A largely predictable ""chase"" spec-fic book - with a sprinkling of original-ish ideas to keep it going in the long, dry middle.First, the bad. If you're up on your Greek mythology, you'll know the entire plot by page 7. In ""Matrix-like"" or ""Stephen-King-esque"" style, the main characters have terribly telegraphic names. The protagonist is named ""Cassandra,"" for example, so it's not too much of a surprise when we discover she's forever making predictions that no-one believes... unfortunately they're all that obvious.There are, however, some neat sci-fi ideas contained here, and since several of them are quite a lot of fun, interest is somewhat maintained.A decent enough novel for a quick summer read."
4,excellent on 2 levels,"Heard the author speak so I thought I give it a try.On one level the plot was interesting, engaging with good character development and on a different level, the incorporation of the author projection of how messianic times might look was interesting. definitely would recommend as a good and interesting read - though not great literature"
3,"A clever, hilarious spin on horror and lesbian drama","This is lesbian drama to the extreme, and it's hilarious. Imagine a group of lesbian ex's and their current lovers going camping ofr a weekend. You all know the inevitable: drama! Only in ""Make a Wish"" the drama turns in to a murder mystery and campire chatter and steamy tent-hopping action leave not only broken hearts but disappearing people.It's Susan's birthday, and she invites all of her exes and their girlfriends for an annual camping weekend. Attempting to leave behind inhibitions, jealous boyfriends, men in general, and heartbreaks of the past, the group ventures into the unknown -- the unknown woods and the unknown truth. And most of them never get out.A mocking horror story of lesbian drama, you'll like it even if horror movies are not your thing. And you'll definitely laugh at some choice one-liners and at the undeniable possibility that dyke drama is really this crazy!"
4,Apparel,The t-shirt is adorable. The fabric quality is very good no shrinkage in the laundry and the fit is accurate. I wore it yesterday and could see people reading it and laughing.
3,Not at all like the Mind's Eye,I have all of the Odyssey Productions videos and this is by far the worst. It's very similiar to the early X-MIX series. It's more of a screensaver than something you'd sit in front of and watch for a half hour. Don't buy this unless you're like me and need to complete your collection. I reccomend this to you instead:CyberscapeThe Gate to the Mind's EyeOdyssey Into the Mind's Eye (although I hated the music)Beyond the Mind's EyeImaginaria (not just for kids!)The Mind's Eye
2,"The Gate:to the mind's eye is number 1, Into the Mind's eye is number 2, turbulence is 3","all i can say is that ""The Gate:to the mind's eye"" is the best computer animation trip i have ever experienced still to this day in 2009 and it was made in 1994. Thomas Dolby does a score to the film that's half trance and half Pink Floyd sounding. It is by far the best film and soundtrack out of all of the mind's eye series. This Turbulence is okay during one scene which is really trippy, but it's very very short and altogether i was unhappy when it was over. I'd like to compliment anyone who had anything to do with the making of it though. It did take some talent to make i'll give it that. Just poorly arranged and should not be sold in stores in a box with art on the cover. someone made alot of money on this back in the day and it just doesn't hold a candle to the 1994 one i was talking about."
5,Where has this alligator been all my life?,"What fantastic songs! What I would have given to have Al the Alligator and his Friends around when I had young children. As the lyrics to one of the songs go, ""Everywhere I go, I'm singing my song."" Everywhere I go, I am singing the songs from Al the Alligator. ""Dream Harbor"" is the most perfect bedtime song I have ever heard. And who could resist the ""Meanest Kid"" -- who threw ""rocks in dirty socks,"" and turned out to be just a scared kid deep down inside. Al the Alligator and his friends are going to be meeting lots of my little friends this Christmas! This has to be the perfect holiday or birthday gift - not least because adults will love it, too."
4,Nice looking but not easy to install,"This is a super nice bug shield and it's stainless steel which makes it much more durable compared to the plastic ones on the market today. It is not so easy to install however, the included hardware is a little on the cheap side and it makes it hard to get the well nuts to stay in the holes under your hood, I suggest going to Home Depot or Lowe's and buying some larger well nuts, (they are the little rubber things) that the screws go into under the hood to secure the bug shield to your vehicle, other than that it is a great product!!"
2,Has potential...,"This shield came in a box that was damaged, torn on one end and missing installation hardware and instructions. At Amazon's suggestion went back to Lund, requested the hardware. It took them a couple of days to find it, and now a week later I still have not received. Amazon shipped quickly, but without the hardware and instructions it is just taking up space in my garage. I think it will look good, but so far not impressed with Lund customer service. Parts should have been sent next day, it's only some clips and a few bolts."
5,Excellent Bug Shield!,"I wanted something more durable than plastic and this stainless steel bug shield fit the bill exactly. It is absolutely excellent. Very easy to install on my Nissan Titan. I found the hardware to be well designed and adequate. The installation instructions were not as clear as they should have been, but manageable with a few minutes of puzzling over what they were trying to communicate.If this bug shield fits your vehicle and your style preferences you should buy it as it's quality, fit and appearance are excellent. If they made one to fit my other vehicles I'd buy 3 more."
1,this book was not available!!!!!!!,The book seller was unable to supply this book so I have not seen it!!!!!!!!!
4,Berzerk in my brain!,"My co-workers think I'm crazy because I walk around all day singing lines like, ""Why are you always hiding..."" Groth's most recent release is very catchy, very melodic and very fresh. If industrial music has been stagnating from the absence of new Front 242, Skinny Puppy, et al, Apop is poised to fill the void. However, ""7"" may not be for everyone. The album is a bit schizophrenic, jumping from full-on Goth to Euro-trash techno. Technically, the sounds are great, but the mix isn't. On some songs (ie: ""Non-stop violence""), Groth's vocals are clear and above the instruments. On others, it sounds like he's mumbling under the drums. Overall the album is quite good, but after seeing them live (a PHENOMENAL performance), I was expecting a bit more from the cd."
2,The original issue? Great! The reissue? VOMIT.,"Prospective purchasers should be aware that this is the reissue of the '96 album (originally issued with different cover art and several extra tracks.) While the original was an epic, sweeping album, the reissue removes a good deal of samples, reworks guitar lines and, in its biggest sin, removes the original choirs from Love Never Dies pt. 1 and replaces them with canned, midi choirs. The same album, only steamed, starched, pressed and sterilized. Yuck."
5,an Exellent CD it an 80's vibe very recomended,"what can i say it was my first APB cd i just love it its very dark industrial pop , goth, blend with an 80's vibe that is the best APB cd yet it"
3,Raw talented needs some good stronger vocals,"Having grown up listening to a wide spectra of music from Fleetwood Mac to New Order..was a spinner in clubs during the 80s decade..Id say these group are really exceptional on synthesizers, great tempo,wide range of bpm music..only i wished they had better songwriting skills, and do away with the false throaty vocals and surround echo set up.. Thats raw talent heavily influenced by the frontliner 80s electronica..i ended up wanting to browse through my old records of DM and OMD i am trying to get rid of...certainly not my Kraftwerks..anyway..ill leave this cd on my car stereo and see if i can grow to love this one more..."
5,Apoptygma Bezerk is GOOD!!,"I've listened to a lot of music while working at the college radio station, and Apoptygma is number one on the College Music Journal RPM list. It deserves this position and after listening to the samples here, anyone else into RPM will agree! Buy the Apoptymga Bezerk if you want to hear good RPM!"
3,Eh it's worth a listen.,"This cd wasnt that great. I was kind of dissapointed. Although the Song Mourn is still a good reason to buy it the rest of the songs ar kind of week. Go check out their Album ""Welcome to Earth""."
4,Among APB's best.,"""~Much better than ""Welcome to Earth."" 7 (so named because it is the seventh APB release) grabs you immediately with it's unabashed usage of the Tocata and Fugue in D minor and the Carmina Burrana (which is usually _soooo_ cliche, but this time it works) and doesn't let go.""~ this album is the classic ""Mourn,"" the single for which is their best work. There are effectively 12 songs on the album, though, as two are hidden after periods of silence on track 9, and one with it's own track after that (the final was remixed quite well on the Mourn EP)"
1,i am disapointed,"i didnt get what i asked for. i asked for apoptygma berzerk 7, with 12 tracks. i got a cd from the same artist but it was a remix. it had 10 tracks. it was not what i asked for. i would like to trade it for the cd i asked for. i feel this is unfair that i got something i didnt ask for."
2,Not Worth It!!,"I bought this movie thinking that I was going to get some much needed ""Wire"" action from two of the most ruthless hustlers in the series; boy was I WRONG! This movie is garbage. I hate that I wasted my $10!"
1,DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE OTHER COMMENTS,"This is the type of movie that comes on at 2:30am. Straight to DVD, and should go straight to the garbage. You would think that Marlo Stanfield and Avon Barksdale (Jamie Hector, Wood Harris respectively) will make this movie magical...wrong. They look like amateurs in this movie. The script is horrible, and the director is even worse. The plot and story is just hogwash. Period. Do not buy or rent. You are wasting time in your life by watching this."
3,Almost outdated,"I have looked in grocery stores far and wide trying to find this product and had finally concluded that Kraft had discontinued it. So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Well I do think Kraft has discontinued it and this must be some of the last of it. I ordered this in June, received it in July and now see that it will be outdated in October. Guess we'll be eating a LOT of salad."
4,Decent video,"This one gets you up and moving. It shows you modifications for your fitness level. It is a nice rounded workout, she works several muscle groups. However, none of my muscles ever became fatigued.(except on the tricep dips) Which is good if you're pregnant, but bad if you are used to feeling the burn. She moves along quickly, there isn't a lot of time between exercises. The instructor is in very good shape. I don't give it five stars becuse she does minimal for your abs and there are a few exercises that I find pointless. She does take several opportunities for kiegels, which is nice becuse none of the other videos I have take the time for them."
4,Good stuff,A nice DVD - really nice to have multiple levels of intensity. She is not annoying in the least even after watching many times.
5,Great toning video,"This is not an easy video, but a great workout. I started at the beginner level and my legs were super sore the next day (good sore). I've been doing this video for a few weeks, and I can pretty much do the advanced exercises now without too much stress, but I really feel like I'm getting a good workout in. There's not really a cardio section, so I alternate it with Buns of Steel for pregnancy (which has a good aerobics section but the toning section is kind of lacking), and between the two I get a good variety and feel in pretty good shape."
4,Definately not for beginners!,"This is a tough workout. I'm a pretty avid exerciser and this workout was tough for me. If you're a beginner, not sure I would recommend it. If you are already workingout and want a tough and challenging workout I highly recommend it."
4,Good work out!,"I bought this along with two other videos and this is my favorite. It is difficult enough to be interesting but not too difficult to be uncomfortable. I would have liked a little more interesting abs work out, but overall I enjoyed this video"
4,Definitely a good workout,"I purchased this dvd for a good workout and I believe it gives a decent one. It's a good time frame, too, at @40 min. Granted, it's not a DVD for someone who wants a really challenging workout, but it definitely gets the job done."
4,Excellent workout!,"I wanted a challenging workout to use throughout pregnancy that would keep me in shape!(i am not pregnant yet-but trying!)IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT! This video is challenging and gives you options for different levels (beginner-intermediate-advanced) I am glad i started it ahead of time because it is very challenging!! Definitely need to do some cardio on other days - but this will cover the strengthing exercises!! Also includes kegal exercises during workout. It does come across as a ""low budget"" video (one camera view, music not the best) but the most important thing is the workout - and that is excellent!!Update: I am now 20 wks pregnant and have continued to use this workout 2-3x's a week (in addition to walking 3 miles 5days/week) and it continues to give me a good strength workout. Highly recommended"
3,"Definitely challenging, but you have to like this kind of workout","This is definitely an intense workout that does what it intends to: sculpt and tone. However, you have to enjoy this kind of workout, which involves a lot of repetitive motion like lunges, squats, and so on that really work your muscles but can be boring. I'm a swimmer and practice yoga and prefer the fluidity of those routines compared to this. However, the first time I did this video, I had to rest at points (I was about 14-15 weeks pregnant) because I was so tired (and not used to this kind of workout)! I was also sore the next day, but I haven't done it since and I'm at 20 weeks now. I'm sure that if I did it regularly (which I should), I would be sculpted and toned, but I just get kind of bored with the format. Well-done, but you have to like this kind of exercise to want to stick with it."
4,Holy Cow! This IS a workout...,"This is a serious workout - whether you are a beginner or already in very good shape, this workout will get your heart rate going.Very good workout that feels like you could do it at two months or nine months along. It has variations for beginners, intermediate and advance. The advanced level is very challenging.The production quality is not the best, (that's why I didn't rate as 5 stars) but the content is top notch. Highly recommended."
4,Good solid prenatal workout,"I am used to tough workouts (kickboxing, taebo) but since no prenatal videos are that challenging (for obvious reasons) I have come to accept that this is one of the best ones out there. While it is not going to raise your heart dramatically it will give you a good overall workout. You will need a step, a chair, pillows (or I use a partially inflated exercise ball), and some hand weights though to perform all of the exercises. You are given options for beginner, intermediate, and advanced which is nice. The slight french accent is mildly annoying at times but is not a deal breaker by any means. Music could be better too but again not a deal breaker. I would recommend this dvd for a good prenatal workout."
4,good secondary workout DVD,"I purchased this along with Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout and prefer Summer Sanders, but this is a good back-up for when I want a change. There is only one exercise program and the audio is not as engaging as Summer Sanders, but the exercises are rigorous and include kegels (which I otherwise tend to forget to do)."
5,Awesome,"This workout is everything I was hoping for. It is great for all levels of experience. After just a few workouts I already feel better about my changing body and am confident that I am preparing myself mentally and physically for the demands of labor. Each move lasts just long enought to burn, but isn't so challenging I dread the workout. Also, each exercise is modified for your experience level. I absolutely love the keep up exercise at the end. In this move, you make circles with your arms for three minutes, while concentrating on breathing through the discomfort and visualizing your baby. An awesome mental exercise after a great workout. I would buy this again, and highly recommend it! Oh~ and the music is great too."
4,great video to use throughout your pregnancy,My girlfriend who is very fit recommended this video for me to try during my pregnancy. She did it throughout her entire pregnancy and is also a runner. I am not as fit however I have found that this video still works for me. The different levels for beginners and advanced helps me work on my weaknesses without feeling like I am not keeping up. Karin is quiet and encouraging and I appreciate both because this is not only my exercise time but my quiet time in the mornings before the house is up. She focuses on things like Kegals that will hopefully help me at the end of the pregnancy. This is a great video.
5,Great Prenancy Workout!,"I recommend this workout highly. Its relaxing, an fun. I love how she uses weights. Im a exercising junkie. I was doing p90x and p90x2 for a year and half, then when hit 16 weeks pregnant had to swap out for lowing impact, pregnancy workout. I feel awesome after doing this DVD. She does kegals and stability, core, just a all in one great DVD. Way better than other pregnancy workouts I have done with my first pregnancy. Only complain I have is shes has very low meek voice, with accent. Sometimes its hard to understand what the heck she is saying LOL~Sarah Pemberton Daegu, South Korea"
5,SO glad I picked THIS video!,"I read endless Amazon reviews when deciding which prenatal exercise DVD to purchase. Due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I selected ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Vol. 1"" ... and I am thrilled with my decision. I am 14 weeks pregnant and just completed the DVD for the first time. Even at the beginner level, I feel well exercised. My muscles are already sore! The host's explanation of each move is clear and the modifications for intermediate and advanced students means that I can work toward a more advanced routine without becoming bored with the program. I LOVE this DVD!!! I cannot recommend it enough."
2,Not for me,I was not happy with this workout DVD. I felt some of the moves were too much for a woman who's late in her pregnancy. If you regularly exercised before you got pregnant this is a great video for you. However if you do not exercise I don't think this is the video for you.
3,There are better options,"I bought this video, Lindsay Brin's Second Trimester, and Erin O'Brien's video, and this one is the worst of the three. It is hard to understand her and the music is very new age. Exercises are OK but not very challenging. The other two videos are much better. Lindsay Brin is better for arms/shoulders/back and yoga, and Erin O'Brien's is better for legs and cardio plus it comes with a video for after the baby is born. I would recommend buying one of the other two videos."
2,Weird Video,"I bought this dvd after using Erin O'Brien and Summer Sander's workouts for awhile. I wanted something different to add into my weekly routine. I was very disappointed with this workout. To me it's overpriced for what you get. It's very short and it's kind of bizarre how it's filmed, etc. The workout itself is OK but for some reason everything about this dvd- production, some of the exercises, the narration, just bugged me! I would recommend the Erin O'Brien and Summer Sander's workouts over this one hands down! They are less expensive too!"
2,Not motivational,I bought this video thinking it would motivate me to work out and it did the opposite. It is so boring and the woman doing the video looks like she is going to fall asleep. I don't recommend this video at all...
3,"Good for weight traning, but boring!","I bought three pregnancy workouts: 1. Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout 2. Leisa Hart's Fit Mama 3. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 1.I have done all three and by far my favorite is Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout. It offers about 20 minutes of cardio, 15 mins of weight training, 5 min cooldown, and a relaxation/lamaze section. Of the three dvds it's the only one that really raised my heart rate and got me sweating a little bit, so I actually felt like I got a decent workout.The Perfect Pregnancy Workout is a good dvd if you just want to do weight training. I love cardio and I love to sweat, so this one didn't do it for me. On days when I am feeling a little low on energy, it may be good to do, but I know it won't be on my regular rotation."
4,good work out.,"I found this to be a good workout. The moves are ""easy"", but the combination had me sweating and breathing hard. She is a little annoying.The windows coming up with the different levels is informative but somewhat distracting. Overall, I think this video is for women who work out hard, regularly."
1,Dull & annoying,"I found this workout DVD to be very dull and annoying. I've worn out workout DVD's in the past from using them so often, but this one is collecting dust. The exercises are yawn-ville and listening to the lady narrating is annoying. Her accent is terrible. I'd shop around a bit more before committing to this selection."
1,The Perfect Pregnancy Workout,The work out is mostly strength training and takes alot of time-its not broken down into any segments and almost runs an hour for the complete workout from start to finish-not many people have a whole hour to devote to workout at one time. The trainer is from another country and is very fit but is hard to understand-its obvioius she is a gymnest or professional dancer-not a realistic workout. For the price the work out dvd you would think it would be a better quality but its just her working out in a gym that looks like a highschool gym or something.
1,Am I a contortionist? No.,"I was so disappointed with this video. First of all, the lady is Canadian. Her stupid French accent drove me nuts. Second, they don't tell you before you order the video that she's a member of cirque de soliel--during the video I felt like an idiot because I couldn't even do the ""simple"" moves she was doing. And finally, she can't keep a beat. If you're going to have music in a workout video, then do the moves at the same tempo as the music."
5,Good Workout,I have ordered numerous pregnancy workouts and have only really enjoyed a few and this is one of them. I actually felt like I worked out! I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Great workout for the preggies!,"I really enjoy this video...the first time I did it though, I was SO SORE! But by the second and third time, my muscles had warmed up and it just felt good. The ""keep up"" exercise is particularly fun and challenging (at the very end). I would recommend watching the instructional portion the first time, it will help you to know what you are supposed to do when. Also, I actually do not own a regular chair in my house (we have benches at the dining room table) so I have to make do with a coffee table and bar stool, but you should have one handy. Maybe by month 9 I will be to the ""advanced"" level...or not!"
4,Good Workout,"Another good workout DVD for pregnancy. Not as challenging as I thought it was going to be, but maybe as I get farther along (I am in my fifth month now) it will, but I exercised regularly before I got pregnant."
3,A little disappointing,"This is not one of my favorite workout videos. I like Autumn Calabrese's 9 Months of Fitness and Lindsay Brin's videos much better. This one is all strength/toning, and some of the exercises feel awkward or like they are not really very effective. I feel like I do not get a great workout when I do this one. I also find the woman's voice in the DVD to be a bit annoying. It is intended to be relaxing I think, but when I workout I don't want to feel relaxed, I want to feel challenged."
3,good workout but o'so BORING!,"Overall, a great workout routine. However, it is sooooo boring. They need to add some music and maybe add a bit of excitement to the woman's voice."
5,Great Work out,If you enjoy sweating a little you will enjoy this work out. I am not into yoga- I like my more physical activity. She soes have different levels which is helpful when you want to challenge yourself or take it a litte easy.
4,Good DVD but Intimidating,"This video is great, but the woman in it is very fit and a little intimidating. She shows you how to do the workouts at a few different levels, which is really nice for those of us who are a little slower in our pregnancy days, but seeing her (also very pregnant) doing everything 5 steps above is a bit of a morale buster. If you can deal with that this is a GREAT video."
5,Thorough DVD,"What I love about this DVD is that the creator has made an effort to modify it for beginners, intermediates and advanced pregger moms. That is the best feature of this DVD. If you are up for a challenge and really want to prepare yourself, then do this DVD at least 1 or 2 times a week for a couple of months if you have always been active. Don't push yourself on this one. It has a lot of repetitions and can get boring but it is inspiring to watch the lady do it so effortlessly. I did it for sometime only mostly once a week or so to change things up here and there and I always did the beginners because that is what my gut said. Good stuff.It is understood that you will need to consult your doctor before doing it."
4,Excellent workout!,Great full body & cardio work out. Great cues & easy to follow the instructor. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is expecting & is also wanting to stay in shape!
2,Did not like this,Read reviews online and was thinking this was a little more challenging but was an easy workout. Is easy to follow good for beginners. Also purchased new and dvd skips and will not play certain part of work out.
5,Great workout,"Really enjoying this workout. A good, hard session that makes you feel like you have worked but enjoyable at the same time. The options of beginner, intermediate and advanced exercises are brilliant...although I think it will take me a while to get to advanced!"
4,Great Video...Hard Workout for Pregnancy,This video provides a great workout - they show all excercises in three stages so you can choose what is right for you based on your strength (and what month of pregnancy you are in!). It gives a great workout with safe and 'easy to do' moves.
5,a real workout,this is a very good workout but I wouldn't suggest it for beginners. It caters more to intermediate and advanced.
1,Not So Perfect Workout,"I purchased this DVD when the weather was changing and I could no longer engage in outside exercise activities of swimming and walking. I wanted some type of workout I could do until the end of my pregnancy. I considered myself to be somewhat in shape and physically fit, but when I watched the DVD to see what it entailed I quickly realized this was way above my fitness level and that includes the beginner level. Not only that, but I also considered some of the techniques unsafe as I am large due to my pregnancy and I just do not have the balance I had prior to my pregnancy. I was very disappointed because I read the reviews and thought this would be something I could do. I will stick to low impact activities, which I feel are safe and take into consideration my lack of balance. The woman on the DVD is clearly VERY physically fit and I am just not at that level. I have never used the DVD and never plan on using it. I was very disappointed."
2,Was a woopsie,I actualy thought this was the Yoga (#2) video and when i recieved it i decided to try it anyway. I didnt get passed the first 30min before i just felt like quitting. The girl is a gymnast for a circus or something and has muscles i dont. She does have different levels of intensity but even on the easiest level my legs hurt so bad the next day. I tried it 3 times and still felt very short of breath and tired too fast. (I did workout before pregnancy) i started doing this video 3months into pregnancy and am now over 7months and theres realy no way i can do it now lol.
2,Couldn't even make it through,"I will start by stating that I probably should do the whole dvd before reviewing, but I also think the fact that I could not make it through the dvd is equally important. I did the dvd for about 15-20 minutes and found it so flat, boring and uninteresting, that I quit and put in one of my other prenatal videos. She did offer views of intermediate and advanced positions, and the woman was very toned. Bottom line, there are many resources for prenatal dvds and this one was not worth it."
2,Well...,"I ordered this because so many people rated it well; however, it wasn't good for me. I exercised at the lowest rating because I didn't want to overdo myself. My back hurt so bad the day after that all I could do was lay on the couch. Maybe it's just me, but it was not something I ever want to do again."
2,Ask your doctor first!,"This is a true workout! You will feel it the next day. She does crunches while elevated on pillows, ask your doctor first if this is ok to do! I bought the video without realizing that she does crunches and later asked my doctor. She said it is not a good idea to do crunches while pregnant. You can still do most of the video but if you are new to exercising I wouldn't suggest this one."
1,DON'T BUY WITH BLU-RAY PLAYER,This DVD won't work on our Blu-Ray player and will not get past the menu. I have never gotten to use it. It also won't work on my MAC laptop. Don't waste your money.
3,Very good workout--expert trainer,"I don't think it can be stressed enough that this woman was an acrobat for Cirque Du Soleil. I somehow glossed over that in my reading of the reviews. As a pregnant woman (I'm guessing she might be as far along as 8 months) she has virtually no body fat, is extremely ripped and can still do acrobatic moves. The latter are not part of the movements for viewers, it is in the opening segment. The point being, her fitness level is extremely high. I'm in my second trimester, so I think this will be helpful for me now--I should have gotten it earlier. I doubt I'll be using this in the later stages of pregnancy."
2,"decent, but NOT PERFECT","pretty arrogant to call it the Perfect Pregnancy video, but it is ok....the soft tone of the instructor is a bit cheesy; i like the beginner exercisers but found the pace to be a bit too far off the beaten path. I recommend that you try other prenatal videos to form a well rounded opinion, but mine is that this is just ok."
5,excellent toning workout - pregnant or not,i consider myself to be a very regular exerciser both when i'm pregnant or not. i found this dvd offered just enough challenge. i am 25 weeks pregnant and feel great. this should help keep me toned..
5,"challenging, yet rewarding","I bought this based on the great reviews I read...I think they are right on. It's a challenging workout (more so than any other prenatal workout I've tried) but not so challenging that I feel discouraged. When I've missed a few days, I can definitely feel it--a good kind of sore!I love the warmup and cool down, all the stretching and emphasis on breathing does wonders for my aching back!"
4,Perfect Pregnancy Workout,"This video is great because it is challenging. I do a lot of yoga and I thought that pregnancy yoga videos would be great but they're a little too slow for me. This video made me do other workout moves and it really got my heart pumping. It is a change from the typical yoga exercise but it is worth the pain. I maintain a good weight level exercising with this video. I'm not an athlete nor do I work out a lot when I'm not pregnant but this is a good video for beginners and intermediate people. It only got 4 stars because if you're a workout buff, then this video will wear quickly on you. Otherwise, it is good for me, I'm in my second trimester and I lose my water retention whenever I do workout with this video."
5,Love this workout!,I love this video! I started using it from the beginning of my pregnancy and now at 8 months I still enjoy it and feel like it is helping me prepare for labor. The moves are perfect for beginners and advanced and it hits every muscle group while still providing pre-labor exercises such as kegals and squats. Don't be fooled by the cheesy intro...it is the perfect workout!
2,Not for new beginners....I got intimidated,I placed it into the dvd and after 1 minute stopped it. There is no real structure... you are exercising right off the gate with no stretching. This is not for me... but then again look at what she does for a living. If you want to pay for the shipping for what I got I will send it to you.
4,Good workout and has plenty of options,"I found this workout was hard enough for me - I am currently 15 weeks and was a regular exerciser before falling pregnant. There is plenty of variety and beginner/intermediate options throughout. I was a bit worried taking a class from a cirque du soleil trapeze artist (!), but with the different options available, I was comfortable through the whole workout."
3,"Good, but not for me.","This is a great prenatal workout, but for me even the beginner level was a bit much. Before I became pregnant, I exercised quite a bit, and was in moderate shape. I've miscarried twice in the past and both times always exercised during the pregnancies. So, this time around, I guess you could say I've been a little paranoid about working out. Up until the 3rd trimester I took long walks but that was it. Anyway, I had ordered this DVD months back and at about 29 weeks decided to give it a go. I didn't push myself at all, stuck to beginner levels, and still it was extremely challenging for me. Later that night I had Braxton Hicks contractions and the baby was moving, kicking, stretching like crazy. My muscles and joints were in a lot of pain, but NOT the good kind of pain. So, while I think it was a good workout DVD, I don't think it was good for me."
2,Not for people who were extremely fit before pregnancy!,"I exercise all the time. I have done P90X, Insanity, Asylum, Chalene Extreme - you name it! I am halfway through my pregnancy and have been continuing to do the workouts mentioned. I wanted to try a pregnancy workout that would be challenging enough for my level of fitness but where I could learn what is safe to do during pregnancy. This workout is not it. Even the advanced option in the program feels like I'm hardly doing anything. I did not sweat - at all - and I did not feel sore the next day. I still gave this DVD a 2-star rating because it is better than any other pregnancy workout that I have found. It does SOMETHING, but hardly anything. Parts of it were similar to the Winsdor Pilates DVDs. This DVD is just no where close to my fitness level. I guess I will keep up with my Insanity and P90X because I don't think that an advanced level pregnancy workout exists :("
2,Too Hard for me,"This video was well done, but the workout was wayyyyy too hard for me. I had to modify most of the exercises and I was so sore the next day, I didn't do it again. I didn't work out a lot before pregnancy, so I needed something more basic. This would be good for someone who is a big workout buff - but not a beginner."
4,Good workout,"I started doing this video at around 14 weeks, when I noticed I was gaining weight WAY too fast. Even though I used to run 3 miles 3-4 times a week, I completely stopped in pregnancy out of fear. It's amazing how fast your body deconditions. The video has beginner, intermediate, and advanced options which helped me set goals for my ""rehab."" Yes, the background is boring, the music is weird, and the woman's voice is a bit odd, but the exercises are solid without being overwhelming. It also helped with my flexibility, and I noticed my back and leg pain were almost non-existent on days I did the video."
3,Not what I expected...,"I ordered this DVD based on a large number of raving reviews. I am currently 10 weeks pregnant. After trying the DVD, it is a definitely a challenging workout that left me sore the next day, which is what I wanted. The positive is that she works every part of your body, so it is a total body workout. One negative is that it made my hips feel tight, not good sore the next day. I want to loosen and strengthen my hips during pregnancy, not make them tight! Also, the video is done in a dingy gym (not very professional). I also felt like it moved very quickly from one thing to the next. If you buy this, be aware that you need a chair, weights (for more of a challenge), and pillows during the workout."
3,Too difficult,"This workout was too challenging for me. I would have considered myself at an average fitness level before becoming pregnant. This video is for an advanced fitness buff. During the video there are options for beginner, intermediate and advanced. Even the beginner was too challenging. If you were already an avid workout person before becoming pregnant, this video might be for you. For me, I found this too difficult and skipped a lot of the exercises just to make it to the end."
1,Not worth it,I am certainly the oddball here because I thought this dvd was horrible. I have a few other prenatal workouts and this one was used once. For starters her voice bothered me and I know she can't change that but I felt I could get a bigger workout picking up toys in the living room. This one wouldn't be bad for people who haven't worked out for very long or very little but I was doing Turbo Fire before I became pregnant and so this is way too easy for me. Some of the moves made me laugh so I just donated it to the library.
1,Not great,I was not happy with this exercise workout at all. I exercise normally and I did not like the exercises and actually felt like they could cause harm to my body.The music was bad. The overall production quality was bad.Overall - just not worth it. I wish I did not purchase this product.Don't buy it.
4,great exercises,this is a fun workout. I like how there's a few exercises with beginner/advanced levels. The exercises are more focused on muscle building/definition than cardio. It would have been nice to have a little cardio section on the DVD.
5,My Favorite,"I got this DVD when I was about 10 weeks and have been using it on and off ever since. Pre-pregnancy, I was to really intense workouts so it's been a struggle for me to slow down. I find that most pregnancy workouts are too slow or boring, but this one is fantastic! It combines sculpting and cardio and makes me feel like I've had a great workout. Definitely my favorite."
4,I like it,I am pregnant and I was looking for a DVD with some challenging workout. I am pretty active person and workout almost everyday so this dvd in my opinion is good when you past 5 months and the gym workout might be to heavy. This DVD will be a good option to provide alternative workout.
2,please read this and consider it before you purchase,"i was originally very excited about this dvd because the reviews were really good. my original pregnancy workout consisted of speed walking on my treadmill for about an hour 3 days a week, some light free weight exercises and yoga once a week. when my treadmill broke down i wanted to just get a workout dvd that i could rely on in combination with yoga. at 36 weeks into my pregnancy i found out that my baby was breech and in doing A LOT of research into what could cause a breech baby i found out that an overall strong core can cause all the ab muscles and ligaments to be extremely tight, giving the baby less room to move inside your belly and discouraging him to go head down. i only used this dvd a few times so i don't blame it for my situation, obviously, BUT this dvd has some VERY extreme ab work for a pregnant body and if you choose to use it consistently throughout your pregnancy, just be aware that it can have a downside."
2,Pregnancy Workout Video,Would not have purchased if I had seen the video prior to buying. There are a few good exercises within the video but I can't get past the poor quality of the video as well as the background being dark and uninviting. I have done this video once and can't seem to get myself to do it again. Looking for another good pregnancy video in the meantime.
5,Great workout!,"Most prenatal workouts are just plain boring and do not work any of my muscles. This DVD is great! It has different ""levels"" for you to choose from on alot of the moves which helps more advanced people feel the burn. I have noticed a difference in my strength after only a few weeks of using this. I would reccomend this to every pregnant woman who is actually looking for an interesting,good workout."
5,All the reviews are true!,"So far, have loved this DVD. I bought it based on all the positive recommendations on the site. I think it will be a great prep for labor and delivery, as well as getting me ready for carrying a newborn around."
3,Not great,"I read all the reviews for this dvd before purchasing and was really hoping for more... The work out is okay, in regards to a challenge but is really creepy from beginning to end. This is not like any workout dvd I have ever seen with just 1 person doing the exercises in a dark room with a voice over of the instructions. I do wish I could skip over some portions and/or it was split up into sections rather than going through the whole dvd warm up to cool down.My fitness level was pretty good going into pregnancy; Pre-pregnancy I worked out about 3 days a week, strength training mostly but also ran and did fitness classes occasionally.Some of the exercises you can make more challenging but overall I find it pretty boring and again, a bit creepy. I do like that it seems to focus on exercises that will help with labor and delivery but this is my first child so only time will tell if that is accurate, if I can get myself to do this boring dvd on a regular basis..."
5,Great,"I loved this DVD, as most people seem to. I have been working out my entire pregnancy and was a runner before that and found this to be somewhat of a muscle challenge and fun to do. I like how there are different variations of the workouts showen so that I can do the advance now and as I progress I can step it down to an easier routine. I highly recommend this workout to anyone who wants to stay in shape and feel good about themselves."
5,Great Workout for pregnancy,I love this video. I'm in my 2nd trimester and feel so energized after completing this workout. Its not too difficult but gets your blood pumping.
4,Difficult- but what I was looking for,I wasn't very physically active before I was pregnant but have been working out with an elliptical trainer/ stationery bike since the beginning of my second trimester (now well into my third). This workout was difficult enough for me to stop it half way through even at the beginner level. Although this may be a bad thing for some this is a great thing for me because I have been wanting something challenging that will really get me ready for the vigors of labor and childbirth. I can't wait to try again tomorrow and hope to continue this workout through my pregnancy so I have some stamina to push that baby out- plus be better prepared to get back into shape in the postpartum period.
4,No joke pre-natal workout,"This workout is definitely not for the faint of heart. There are different modifications you can do to follow beginner, intermediate or advanced levels but you'll be sweating no matter which you follow. I started this in my 6th month and it was doable but I definitely had to stick with the beginner level, even though I have stayed active. I wish I had started in my first trimester to keep up muscle tone but I feel comfortable doing it later in pregnancy. Just listen to your body."
5,Great DVD!,I haven't worked out in a few months and this was a great way to get back on track. She shows you variations for different levels for all the exercises. It's easy to follow and a great workout. By looking at her body during the video it keeps you motivated!
4,Endurance and a great workout,"This is a great video. You do feel as if you actually did something. I am 32 weeks along in my pregnancy and I follow the beginning level. I consider myself a fit person. I try to workout four days a week to keep up with my exercise level. The moves are broken down from beginning to advance. The music has an excellent rhythm to use for each move. For a great transition make sure you have the following before starting this workout: a set of pillows or blankets set on top of each other, blankets, a dumbell (or anything for tricep extensions) and a chair. For advance levels, you need a step up. The transitions from moves to moves needs a little work.One thing I do follow like the other reviewers have commented are: if you feel dizzy or tired, stop exersicing. Follow what your body is telling you. Modify your moves to your comfort level. Otherwise, great video. I also do Niece Pecenka ""Pilates During Pregnancy"" for my alternate days."
5,Amazing,"I have a degree in Exercise Physiology and I can't tell you what a relief it was to finally find a pregnancy workout that actually feels like a workout. This is my third pregnancy and before becoming pregnany I lifted for 45 minutes 3 times a week and ran trails for 45 minutes the other 3 days. Since 20 weeks of pregnancy this time (I was sick until then) I have used this DVD alternatingly with elliptical training and I feel fantastic. I'm 31 weeks now and have managed to keep my weight gain down to the normal range for my height, unlike the first two pregnancies. This DVD is amazing. I haven't even touched my Leisa Hart DVD that I used last pregnancy."
5,Ordering again for second pregnany...it was that good!,"I did this workout for my 1st pregnancy 6 years ago. It paid off. I had a great birth and short labor. I was able to get back into shape quicker. I started competing 2 years after giving birth in figure bodybuilding shows. I always look back and tell my friends how working out is so important during pregnancy. I think you will benefit from any prenatal fitness routine, but what I liked about this one and the reason why I am reordering for my second pregnancy, is I loved her workouts and the music. I was always motivated to do her workouts. I liked the screens that gave you the option to do the advance or beginner version at the same time. I am 8 weeks pregnant and looking forward to doing this workout again."
1,hated it!,"I've found it so hard to find a good prenatal workout, so when I read the reviews of this workout I desperately wanted to like it. I've worked out a lot prior to being pregnant so I am not new to exercise. I found this workout to be very odd. Many of the moves felt awkward and I didn't feel like I was working anything during large portions of the workout. I was very disappointed and probably won't ever do this workout again."
1,Not impressed,"I couldn't make it through this workout because I was so bored. It just wasn't what I expected. The music was awful, the narrating voice was annoying and it wasn't challenging. Maybe this is good for beginners."
2,Boring,This exercise DVD is very boring! I can't imagine sticking to this for the duration of my pregnancy. I did this once and find it hard to motivate to do it again. I am an avid exersiser and have done many home fitness DVD's prior to this pregnancy. I love the Jillian Michaels DVDs - wish she made a pregnancy workout...
3,OK,"I thought this workout video was ok. It wasn't one that I wanted to do again after, though. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
4,Fabulous!,This was a great workout! I would recommend! I am a first time mom and I have had a great pregnancy - I wanted this to continue to stay in shape for the big day!
3,Just ok.,I only did this video once at 28 weeks. It was much too advance to start that far into my pregnancy. I preferred Prenatal Yoga.
3,Lots of Arms,"I bought this video because of the other positive reviews. It wasn't horrible, but mostly arm work. I would like more leg work. I am used to dping pilates. If I could have previewed it I wouldn't have bought it. It's not horrible, but I only feel like I worked my arms. I would have liked more/harder legs work. I did mostly the beginner moves. Maybe next time I will do the advanced."
5,Pregnancy Workout DVD that actually makes you sweat!,"I really have enjoyed this video so far in my 6 1/2 months of being pregnant. The added weights and ""advanced"" moves help to make it more challenging and not just a fluffy workout DVD for those who want to break a sweat. I feel great after doing the video and like my body has also had a good stretch. I think my little girl growing inside of me likes it too! Overall, worth the money!"
3,Good Product...,"Like this DVD, but many of the positions are not doable if you are in your third trimester....a little disappointed. She looks much further along on the cover than she does in the video!"
4,Good Workout,"I read tons of reviews on this DVD before I bought it. All of the negaitve reviews talked about how the workout was so hard and confusing. If you are fairly physically fit and will actually watch the instructional section once, ignore those reviews.This is a good workout DVD. You will want to go through the instructional information at least once. It only took me once and I was off to the races. The DVD has three levels of workout. Yes, some of the advanced is pretty hard. I'm not sure I could do it not pregnant. But the beginner and intermediate are pretty easy.This workout doesn't actually get my heartrate up too much at all (less than the Erin O'Brien DVD), but I like the different exercises that it has on it. The music is better than the Erin O'Brien DVD, but I kinda tune music out anyway."
2,Not for everyone,"I could never get into this but I am also someone that much more prefers being outside- walking, jogging, etc. I had another friend refer it to me so I know she liked it but I literally used it a couple times when I was pregnant and otherwise, it collected dust."
2,don't have the space,I researched a lot before buying this DVD as well as a prenatal yoga DVD (which I loved!). But I tried to do the work out in this one once and gave up. I do not have a lot of space in front of the TV in my house and the work out in this DVD requires you to use certain household items (like a chair) to aid in the workout. It might actually be very good but it didn't work out for me. I stuck to doing the prenatal yoga and walking for my pregnancy fitness.
2,"just ok dvd, difficult exercises, fast moves","This is an okay dvd, not that great as reviews say.I exercised 3-4 times a week before pregnancy and am in pretty good shape, however I find these exercises are very fast , and some of the moves are very difficult.I like Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea much better- calm and a good yoga workout"
2,Not so perfect,"I consider myself to have a reasonable level of fitness and flexibility. I purchased this DVD based on the positive reviews posted on Amazon but I was disappointed and concerned when I tried the workout myself.Some of the exercises seemed unsafe especially the abdominal crunches, lunges, squats & push-ups (even the modified versions) when you consider the hypermobility of joints and centre of gravity changes in pregnancy.The instructor doesn't appear to grasp the concept that not every woman was a superfit trapeze artist prior to pregnancy. From what I can tell she does not have any formal qualifications in prenatal fitness, but rather developed this exercise program based on her own needs and level of fitness. On the positive the warm-up it very good.Erin O'Brien's Pregnancy Fitness Fix (for more experienced exercisers) or Leisa Hart's FitMama (more moderate intensity) appeared to be safer but still higly effective options."
2,bblltwnty1,"I dont like how they show, intermedidate and advanced in little windows on the side of the screen. You should be able to choose beginner, intermediate, and advanced workout on the menu. The workout was ok"
1,Cheap ploy by Decca,It's pretty lame of Decca to re-release this old recording of Bell playing the Tchaikovsky just a few months before Sony releases a brand new one.Save yourself a twenty and wait for the Sony version. Bell plays the Tchaikovsky *much* better at 36 than he did at 19.
5,Ray Brown,"This was my first CD of Ray Brown, and It is very good. It features several different guitar players from Kenny Burell to Bucky Pizzarelli. Get tunes."
5,Comprehensive and detailed,"I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics and recently bought this book for background reading related to my research in credit risk modeling with latent variables. The authors were able to produce a very readable treatment of Markov Chains, Monte Carlo methods and the EM algorithm. The book contains plenty of examples in finance, communications theory, ... Overall, I am very pleased with my decision to buy this book."
3,Alvin!,"The mountain/old-fashioned dialect was great at first as an audiobook, but after a while, I started to ""translate"" the dialect into modern language to follow the story. I didn't bond with Alvin's character so I wasn't sure I would want to read more of the series. The last 20% of the book was screechingly grotesque with the surgery scene. I swear I could feel the heebie jeebies up and down my arms. Scary ending. The Miller family is amazing and a lot of the characters in the book are really interesting. I just couldn't ""adore"" Alvin like so many of the characters in the book did. It's a short book and the last section is very exciting."
3,"Interesting, But Incomplete","Orson Scott Card shows his strength, once again, at portraying important children well, but to little overall effect in this volume. Everything seems to be set-up for something else, not included in this story. Peggy is established as an interesting child, then dropped for much of the book. Alvin's powers and his character are revealed in the last two thirds of the book, but he doesn't really get to do anything. Reverend Thrower and Taleswapper are interesting, if a bit strongly characterized, but their introductions and motivations are all a bit abrupt and a bit mysterious at the same time. We are given an alternate America, but one which is different for reasons not important to the story, as far as we see here. While there are compelling segments and characterizations, this book is incomplete--mere exposition for books to come, leaving me unsatisfied and unwilling to pursue the rest of the tale."
5,A unique American fantasy,"This book is truy unique as an American fantasy set in the 19th century instead of some pseudo-medieval Europe fantasy world. One thing I'd like to note about this novel is that the story is not entirely Card's; he wrote it as an allegory of the life of Joseph Smith, founder of the LDS (Mormon) Church. Card is a lifelong Mormon and has woven elements of LDS history, doctrine, and culture into many of his works, most notably the Homecoming series (adapted from the Book of Mormon). As an LDS church member myself, I found this book fascinating. Of course, it stands alone and is well worth the read for anyone. Card makes many important points and raises many valuable questions- and the rest of the series is excellent as well. A MUST if you are a Card fan!"
3,"Slow start, nice finish","After reading the Enders saga, which had its falts but yet was very enjoyable I wanted to read more Card books. I looked forward to this series and was dissapointed with it for the first 100 pages. After the initial shock of a new style of writing I began to enjoy it, with the help of some different charecters. It is worth the time to read it, barely."
3,VERY SLOW first half,"I love Card's other books, so I bought this one.It begins with a tiny bit of action, but then soon lulls into a vague land of extreme boringness.The story doesn't really start again until about halfway through the book, but from there on it's decent again.I think this book needed extreme editing, cropping out a huge section of the book.However, the 2nd half of the book gives you just enough interest that you might be interested in its sequel."
5,GREAT BEGINNING TO A GREAT TALE,"THE BEST THING ABOUT THE SEVENTH SON IS THAT THERE ARE 5 MORE BOOKS TO CARRY ON THE WONDERFULLY TOLD STORY.ALTHOUGH DELIGHTFULLY FANCIFULL IN ITS ALTERNATE AMERICA HISTORICAL APPROACH, IT IS THOUGHT-PROVOKING AND STIR SOME DEEP CHORDS IN THE SENSITIVE READER.I'LL HAVE TO QUIT NOW, BEFORE I USE MORE ADVERBS!"
5,Nice! Read it!,"I loved Seventh Son. The characters are colorful and deep, none have only one dimension. The hero, Alvin Jr., knows mischief and selfishness like any child does, and Preacher Thrower, who is unknowingly working for mankind's greatest enemy, is a kind man at heart. This novel is obviously an introductory novel, and does a great job of presenting the characters and themes. I can't wait to read the rest of this series!!"
4,A phenomenal read!,"Orson Scott Card has always been one of my favorite authors and this series is no exception. Seventh Son is the first of the Alvin Maker series, a tale set in a colonial America where magic is real and history went somewhat differently. Alvin is the seventh son of a seventh son which means he was born to be something special and powerful. The book is hard to put down and captivates you from beginning to end.My only big complaint about the Alvin Maker series came about this past rereading of it. My copies of the Alvin Maker series are all suffering from being read so many times. This last reread made realize how often religion plays a part. Perhaps in the past I somehow overlooked it, though I'm not sure how. Every few pages is mentioning, questioning or referencing some form of spiritual entity. I'm not uncomfortable reading about religion, but when I look forward to reading a fun alternate-history fiction saga, I'd prefer it with slightly less preaching in it."
2,Not Available on Kindle even though the other 5 are??!!??,"I think this is an excellent book, as well as the series being great; however, after purchasing my new AmazonKindle, I discovered that I could download the Alvin Maker series Volumes II through VI, but not Volume I - Seventh Son. How does that make any sense at all? I am extremely frustrated about this."
3,And the Story is?,"When I got done with this book I thought of it as a kind of preface perhaps, considering it just gives the background for the main characters - Alvin Miller Jr., Peggy (not much of a main character now, but she will be in the other books) and Taleswapper. In the book Card tells what the ""powers"" of a 7th son of a 7th son are, and tells about the ""unmaker"" who constantly tries to kill young Alvin. Anyway, I believe this book is a preface because there is no adventure or story."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Boring mormon wish-fulfillment fantasy. In this arena, David Gemmell he is not. If that is what you are after, then by all means get it, otherwise something like The Jerusalem Man will be much more appealing. You could, however, use them as a cure for insomnia, or severe lack of homey American pastoral romanticising. You will know pretty quickly whether this holds any interest at all."
3,Not a Badly Written Book for an Anti-gay Bigot,"Decent storytelling, but I just couldn't get out of my mind the rather extreme right-wing, pro-war and anti-gay statements and positions of Orson Scott Card. I had never read anything by Card before, and deep into the book I googled him, as I often do when reading a new author. Seems he is a rather controversial man, and based on what I found on the internet, his political and spiritual values are far from my own. I read fiction for pleasure, but also hopefully to expand my mind, heart and imagination in a positive way. For this reason, I try to steer clear of authors known to be bigots and warmongers. Knowing that some of a fiction writer's basic values are antithetical to mine does often negatively color the experience of reading that writer's work. If you are also taken out of a story because you find the author's political and spiritual views upsetting, I recommend you give this book a pass."
2,Huh? Where did Old Card go?,"I love Card's old work, and Ender's Game has a permanent spot on my top 10 list. But what has happened? The man is slipping, as he cannot keep a coherent story going. Xenocide and Children of the mind come to mind. I got this hoping I could forget those travesties of writing, and yet, Seventh Son falls into the same pit. Card doesn't really bring up one reason why I should care AT ALL for any of the characters. So the priest is being fooled, its not like he did a good job of covering that up, he gives it away time and again! Not suspenseful in the least... Heck, I could already tell you the plot to the rest of the books after having read this one. Now that I think about it, if you read Ender's Game, you could probably figure out the plot from this one. Does ""Extremely Gifted Child"" sound familiar to you? Skip this and go try out some new author, SciFi needs some new voices, not Card (who spends his time screaming for attention... just look at his web site)."
1,I can't believe someone published this.,"6 volume series? he man could have easily compressed this into 400 pages, but he's so long winded with everything. And reading this feels like i'm standing at the front door with Jehova's Witnesses. Ender's game was great. It deserves 5 stars. But i'm almost convinced it was written by someone else."
5,"A Wonderful, Wonderful Book!","This story is simply wonderful. This is my favorite fantasy novel of all time. Not only is it an enthralling and entertaining tail of a boy growing up in a magical America, but it has the power to change the way you see the world. Orson Scott Card does not scimp on his characters nor on the meaning behind his words. I definetly recommend this book!"
2,"Recycled Clips, Sloppy Editing","I looked forward to reading this book from the moment last fall that I learned it was due out in April. To say it was a letdown would be to put it mildly. Although Nachman lists the dozens of interviews he himself conducted for the book, the text is overwhelmed with quotes from old bios, fan magazines, newspaper reviews, etc. And Nachman has an annoying habit of skipping around in such a haphazard, non-chronological manner, that the reader is easily confused. He's also sloppy when attempting to place certain events in historical context -- for instance, he lists ""All in the Family,"" The Jeffersons,"" ""Sanford and Son"" and ""Different Strokes"" as ""late-60's"" TV series,when in fact they were early-to-mid 70's. There are several more such sloppy mistakes. His earlier work, ""Raised on Radio,"" is far superior -- and it's obvious he enjoyed writing it a whole lot more than he did ""Seriously Funny."""
4,A compelling and well-structured work,"I began flipping through this excellent book in a moment of boredom and just kept reading. Though I'm a fan of a few of the comedians covered in the book, many of them are of no particular interest to me -- moreover, I don't even care for most stand-up comedy (preferring sketch comedy), and the majority of the stories told here are stories of great stand-up comics. But the author is so good at describing the talents, contexts, and events that made these individuals important comic entertainers, that the book really grabbed and held my interest. I recommend it for anyone interested in glimpses into some brilliant comic minds from the heyday of sophisticated comedy, and in concise yet adequately detailed accounts of why and how these people evolved from unknowns to household words."
1,Minolta Maxxum 5 could be trouble,I bought this camera the Date model from Tri State Cameras 2 months ago. I ran 2 rolls of film through it and every thing went fine. All of a sudden the next 6 rolls did not expose the film at all. I found out the shutter louvers malfunctioned. Lost my whole vacation pictures. Then I thought I found out the probluem and the date back malfunctioned. I had a nice yellow beam of light accross the bottom of all my shots except the last picture on the roll. This was the next 5 rolls. Sent back to Minolta for warrentie service a week ago. I have not heard anything yet. I am very disapointed in this new Minolta camera!Buy a Canon or a Nikon.
4,"New ideas, new sounds, same great band","""Fold you hands"" shouldn't dissapoint fans of ""boy with the arab strap"". It's a further extension of the ideas on that album, and for the most part, quite a bit better. Each song has a very distinct sound. Unlike earlier B+S albums, ""hands"" eschews the sort of trancey song-blurring-into-song ephemeral folky groove for a much beefier almost chamber-pop style... now, don't get me wrong, it's not as if it sounds like Apples In Stereo or the Flaming Lips.. but there certainly is a little more meat on the minor-key bones of these tunes. Everything just seems a little less fragile, a little more fleshed out. The melodies are lovely as ever, and the lyrics sound much less precious bolstered by a more expansive pallet of sound. For fans of the minimal (and brilliant) folk-pop of ""Tigermilk"" and ""Sinsiter"", this record may require some adjustment, but It's a quality album throughout"
1,Pretentious,"I just want to say that I like Belle and Sebastian okay, but I think this is the most pretentious title of any work by anybody in any genre I have ever heard. I just think that fact sums up the type of music they create and the people that listen to them - pretentious snobs who have their thumbs up their behinds."
4,FOLD YOUR HANDS.......GREAT CD,"From reading the reviews there seems to be mixed feelings towards this cd , die-hard fans comparing to past glorys bla bla bla ...as this being my intro to belle and sabastian its left me gagging for more and by reading the die-hard reviews i ve got a better idea of what cd to buy next. cheers."
3,Murdoch Withdrawal,"Aside from the haunting sensitivity of ""I Fought in a War,"" the songs on _Fold Your Hands..._, show little progress and development for B&S. Indeed, the group's pleasant reminiscent air now borders dangerously on nostalgic self-derivation. ""Woman's Realm"" is nearly identical to the title track of 1998's _Boy with an Arab Strap_. Potentially, this is because singer Stuart Murdoch has receded from his usual position as the group's primary songwriter. The resulting album lacks new inspiration, forced at times to become an unsuccessful mimicking of vintage B&S. ""I Fought in a War"" is the only track that the ingenuity of Murdoch's lyrical enjambment and line wrapping is exhibited in all its subtleties. I have great qualms in even recommending this record to die-hard fans for fear that they too would suffer, like me, from Murdoch withdrawal."
2,Major let down,"I'm a fan of B & S but feel shortchanged by this album with only 3 of the 11 songs worth the admission to their 60's world of whimsy. Sure, the other songs have cute hooks and sweet instrumentation, but ultimately disappoint. The tracks I can really get into are 'Wrong Girl', 'Women's Realm' (named after a British weekly mag aimed at middle-aged, middle-class ladies of this sceptred isle), and 'There's Too Much Love'. These songs are up there with the best that B & S have ever done. Finally, why 'Legal Man' is not on the album is confusing. This recent single is on a par with the best album cuts and would have added a change of pace and extra colour to a fairly insipid affair. Do better next time, gang."
3,beautiful but heartless,"I think ""Tigermilk"" represented this band's best work, and this does little to disprove that notion. This lacks the humor and joy of that album and ""...Sinister"" (which are both necessary) for another collection of pretty but increasingly complex songs. Only ""The Wrong Girl"" has the verve of their early work. On most of the rest of the album, you hear the arrangement rather than the song. ""I Fought in a War"" is so dreary as to be painful (plus, it stretches the letters-from-battle concept pretty thin). and ""The Model"" is another standard-issue song where Stuart David gets coy about sex. Ironically, the most surprising work comes from other band members, like Sarah Martin's ""Waiting for the Moon to Rise,"" which has the warm frailty of the Field Mice's best work. Other than that, only the most cultlike fans will find charm here. Others will see a sea of prettiness (make no mistake, the band's interplay and arrangements are ace) without anything specific to grab on to."
4,"New ideas, new sounds, same great band","""Fold you hands"" shouldn't dissapoint fans of ""boy with the arab strap"". It's a further extension of the ideas on that album, and for the most part, quite a bit better. Each song has a very distinct sound.

For fans of the minimal (and brilliant) folk-pop of ""Tigermilk"" and ""Sinsiter"", this record may require some adjustment, but It's a quality album throughout"
3,Crying over spilt (Tiger)Milk,"I enjoyed this cd a great deal; however, I feel that it is the group's weakest effort. Still, an ok ""Bell & Sebastian"" cd is better than 95% of the junk out there. I just wasn't grabbed by much of it in the way that I was with ""Tigermilk"" or ""Arab Strap"". They were wise to lead of the cd with ""I Fought In A War"", far and away the best song on here. I don't recommend this cd for the casual fan (start with one of the 3 earlier ones) but for someone who enjoys the band's music, this cd does have it's rewards"
4,yet more brilliance (yawn),"""Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant"" (nice title, kids) is a fairly typical B&S record: it's another collection of wispy, enigmatic, slightly silly, and absolutely masterful pop ditties presented by way of the usual offhanded, retro-sounding approach. Don't get me wrong, this is great stuff -- but can you imagine what they could do if they actually started TRYING? Just a thought...."
4,"Wow, everyone else is so disparaging about this CD!","Yes, this is the first Belle & Sebastien CD I bought but it's also my favourite. It's much more varied than the other CDs which I find kinda boring. The two amazing tracks are ""The Model"" and my all time favourite ""Waiting For The Sun To Rise"". I don't really like the jaunty stuff later on (sounds very 60s and musically a bit dull), but the really beautiful arrangements and haunting melodies of these two tracks make up for them twelve-fold - outstanding!"
3,Buy every Belle and Sebastian release but this one,"I love Belle & Sebastian but not this cd. They've added way too many people and have incorporated so many differing ideas into too little space to do anything properly. This cd is an amalgamation of several half ideas, it incoporates non of the perfection and tenderness I associate with previous Belle & Sebastian releases. Buy every other Belle & Sebastian cd just don't buy this one it bears little resemblense to any of their other cds."
2,You better love 'em to like this,"""Tigermilk"" was promising, and ""If You're Feeling Sinister"" and ""The Boy with the Arab Strap"" were absolutely captivating. ""Fold Your Hands,"" by contrast, seems to be comprised of the formulaic throw-away dregs. It sounds like the soundtrack to one of the 60's hippie-exploitation films like ""I Love You Alice B. Toklas"" complete with bubble machines and vinyl skirts. One or two okay songs, but don't expect anything like the last two albums. Put a fork in 'em: they're done."
2,Buy every Belle and Sebastian release but this one,"I love Belle & Sebastian but not this cd. They've added way too many people and have incorporated so many differing ideas into too little space to do anything properly. This cd is an amalgamation of several half ... ideas, it incoporates non of the perfection and tenderness I associate with previous Belle & Sebastian releases. Buy every other Belle & Sebastian cd just don't buy this one it bears little resemblense to any of their other cds."
1,Where are the pop hooks?,"I think the new Belle and Sebastian is weak - monotonous and uninteresting - and not much of a pop album at all. It's a huge step down from ""The Boy With The Arab Strap"" which was a wonderful album full of energy and irresistable pop hooks (A Summer Wasting, The Boy With The Arab Strap, etc). None of the songs on the new effort are very memorable, and they just drone on and on in an uninspired way. If they produce another album, I can't see myself running out to buy it."
5,The Season Has Arrived,"A friend of mine at a local college paper in my hometown who writes for the paper too said that Fold Your Hands was like a new musical dream and picks off where Dirty Dream Number 2 leaves off from Boy. It is very multidimensional.Yes, the season has arrived."
2,Fold Your Hands Child...,"YIKE!!! Either that I should have listened to the other reviewer and bought the CD ""If You're Feeling Sinister"" because I think I've wasted my money on this one!!!This is my first time hearing B&S and I'm not sure if I want to spend money on any of their CD again."
4,Hmm,"If I were given to hyperbole (or ""hyperbowl"" here in Georgia), I would say that this album has the best title ever given to any artistic creation in the history of civilization, even if it is short one comma. But since I'm not, I'll just say it's a great Belle & Sebastian album with one or two clunkers."
3,Just about half good,"I'm with previous reviewer dave-g: where are the hooks? I won't pummel it with 1 star, though, because there are some good songs. ""Waiting for the Moon to Rise"" is really lovely. ""The Wrong Girl"" does have some of the old hookiness. ""The Chalet Lines"" moves me. ""Nice Day for a Sulk"" is just too pleasant to get mad at the lyrics. Still, this ain't no _Boy with the Arab Strap_."
3,Confused mild success,"Lacking a typical assuredness, especially after following one of their best works, FYH works only as a partially impressive transition disc with a large amount of automatic filler and/or identity-less entries only worthwhile for the handful of chamber-pop gems the band singularly provides."
3,"Mixed bag, though the clunker to gem ratio is unfavorable","This album has some really great B&S songs, most notably: I Fought in a War, The Model, and The Chalet Lines. The rest are OK. There are a couple of stinkers, the stand out being Beyond the Sunrise, it's not awful, but the dude's voice in contrast to the rest of the album is just painful."
2,Harder than my brother's head,"I work for a leading package delivery service and am always looking for nice looking, sturdy, and comfortable footwear. This shoe was so hard that it could not flex in all the places a shoes needs to in order to be comfortable. With each step my feet would send messages to my brain that went ""oooch, ouch, oooch, ouch."" Too bad I had to return them because they looked great with my uniform!"
2,Doesn't works for me,sorry .rent it by a mistake .don't know what it talk about .nono no no no .won't rent it again
4,Good!,"I received it in a few days. The condition was probably described well but the DVD case was a bit beat up and couldn't hold both disks because it was broken. I had to use a DVD case of my own (I was concerned the disks would get scratched, falling out all the time). It isn't a big deal. The disks are scratch-free and in great condition!!!! :)"
5,Weeds: Season Two,"I started watching this show on Showtime, loved it so much I bought Season One and Season Two, so I could watch them over and over again. Great show."
4,Good stuff,"I didn't like the second season quite as much as the first season, but the characters are still hilarious and ridiculous and it's worth watcing."
3,Weeds Season 2 Blu Ray,"This was one of the first Blu Ray titles I purchased. Since then I have learned to read reviews on any Hi-Def titles before I purchase them. I love the show but unfortunately it looks horrible on Blu Ray. Everytime there is a dark scene, you see all of the compression in the blacks and darker tones. Its awful and I wonder if it looks better on regular DVD. It definitely looks better just watching it on TV."
3,Losing Its Appeal!!,"Loved the first season!! The second was a mess. It is a bad sign when you want the main charater to get caught because she has become so unlikeable.Not to mention her idiot son and brother-in-law. Not funny just plain unlikeable. Oh well, maybe the intent was to show drugs make you stupid....and mean. Better do some fancy footwork with season three to redeem this sad show."
5,Most Amazing,"Most amazing show on tv. hands down.I love the off handed LIBERAL comments that are made, sorry halliburton youve been put on blast =]"
2,multi region dvds,"got the dvd in good time,but would not play on my dvd recorder as it is not multi region as i thought it was.dont think dvds should have been released to england with out first being able to play on english dvds.never mind to late now to send it back"
2,Scenes were cut out,"I loved the season overall,, but alot of scenes were cut out of the original episodes. I assumed it would be full length"
3,Quality show,"Three stars because this season didn't live up to some of the hype I read about. Some of the plot points seemed a bit implausible. Still a good show at a great price, much better than Californication."
3,not very accurate for wood,"use for relative moisture content inside of boat deck cores, under fiberglass. If you want accurate MC readings in wood, you need a pin type, no question."
4,Albert King: Born Under a Bad Sign,"A great introduction to Albert King, this is a collection of Stax hits for release on the radio, so all the tracks are short, not much stretching out! I am a blues guitar player who is having a ball learning these songs. This great bluesman had a unique style that influenced Clapton and SRV. I didn't care for tracks #'s 7, 10, 11. I highly recommend this CD!"
5,The Best,"Did you like this one? So you have also to listen to I'll Play the Blues for You (1972), from Albert King!Although he recorded many albums, Albert King never received the credit he deserved because of his excellence as a player and as a bluesman. Everything changed when he signed with the legendary Stax label, and on the first album released by new home in 1966, with the support of the group Booker T. & The MG's in the recordings. The union between the King and the biting guitar sound basis and full of sauce provided a funky band repertoire as killer as classic, with the title track, ""Oh, Pretty Woman,"" ""The Hunter"" and ""Laundromat Blues,"" later re-recorded by Clapton, Gary Moore, Rory Gallagher and Free respectively. Great album!"
1,Forget it,"""King Of The Blues Guitar"" is much better. However if I were starting my Albert King Collection I would first buy Rhino's ""The Ultimate Collection"" and then of equal importance I would buy Modern Blues' ""Let's Have A Natural Ball"" lastly I would buy MCA's ""Door To Door"". While there are certainly more Albert King CDs to be had, these three issues are MANDATORY!"
2,Difficult Read Pays Off for McMartin Buffs,"This book consists mostly of extremely lengthy excerpts from trial testimony as recorded by the husband and wife authors, who attended the McMartin trials.The book does not follow the standard true crime formula and takes some diligence to read. There are hardly any breaks in the text or chapters in the trafitional sense, so stopping in a convenient place can be difficult.The authors do a good job in showing how the overzealousness of the L.A. County D.A's office lead to the abuses suffered by the defendant's in the McMartin case.However, at times the authors go off on what seem like paranoid tangents as they rail against what they perceive as the ritual child abuse industry.If you saw the HBO movie about this case, the book is an interesting companion and goes into more detail."
1,McMartin,"Did any of the reviewers attend the McMartin Preschool? Are any of you related to someone that attended the school? All of the reviewers and the author must be related to Peggy or Buckey.I guess none of the reviewers saw the aftermath of what that sick and demented school did to the children that attended.If the school was still standing, would you send your child there?I am disgusted!"
2,lamp was broken really good.,"so i called the company and they sent out a replacement. it took 6 weeks for the next lamp to be sent. But the lamp is so cute, So im pleased."
1,Gary Null's NEW and Horrible Green Stuff,"Up until recently, I was enjoying Gary Null's Green Stuff for over 17 years. Drank it with water, and it was a GREAT product. A few months ago, I ordered some more, and the first thing, I noticed was the container was only 60% full, but when I drank it, I spit it out, thinking I had gotten a bad spoiled batch.So I opened another one, and....same awful taste.My questions to web site went unanswered, and when I spoke to someone at one of his health vitamin closets, they mentioned that it was a new manufacturer and new taste.I gave him my review, and said, after 17 years, I will never buy this product again...what a shame.I have since bought GREENS PLUS, and use it in water, with a little Blueberry Pomegranate, and it's very good tasting.I don't understand how Gary could change the product so drastically.....for the worse."
3,"Not for me, but maybe for you","This band was recommended to me, and I'd heard they were the group that Black Dice is ripping off now. For my taste though, this is way too hippy-dippy and ""nice."" Though I do like noisy music, and there are some noises in here, I also like edgy music, and this just sounds very pleasant and new-agey to me, even the ""noise."" Maybe if you really like the recent Flaming Lips albums you'll dig this."
1,"Amazing Album, Crappy Vinyl","This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Unfortunately, Sides B and D are completely unlistenable due to all the skips and pops. Amazon should not be selling this faulty product."
1,Brutally Insincere,"This release is the most palatable to come out of the Animal Collective and does have some genuinely catchy, even, dare I say, ""affecting"" moments, but, everything I've been exposed to from these guys just screams insincerity. All the stuff they do live and on pretty much every other release is redolent of an anally-fixated infantile routine performed by priveleged hipsters revelling in the shock value of their ""act"". This particular release is all the more frustrating in that it suggests that they could produce some genuinely good ""music"" if they applied their efforts in that direction. Sadly, with these guys, the schtick is 1000x more important than the music."
1,Not Music at All,"Perhaps this collection of sounds might be an interesting experiment in what you can get the public to buy, but it certainly isn't music. Some might call this progressive or some other term to denote a lack of musical ability, which presumes that only those of great artistic sensibility can really appreciate the work; I call it worthless."
4,Nice,"I think this may be their best one so far. As anyone reading this by now probably already knows, the music here attracts admirers through it's originality, sunny tone and left-field weirdness. Leaf House, Rabbit, Winters Love, We Tigers and maybe Kids on Holiday are the immediate tracks that standout. Songs like ""Softest Voice"" and ""Visiting Friends"" take getting into but anyone with an appreciation for ambient music who has a few minutes to just turn off their brain and do nothing but listen to the music should probably like those tracks as well. ""College"" is a track that no one ever talks about but is the closest thing to Beach Boys harmonizing I've ever heard from any of all the so-called bands over the years who sound like Pet Sounds. At the end of the track there's a lyric that anyone can find amusing. The last three tracks do nothing for me, hence the deduction to 4 stars."
5,Urm....Yes!,"I have no idea what's going on throughout most of this album, but whatever it is, it's incredibly captivating and often beautiful in its own way. This is the soundtrack to a Wes Anderson film if he was really into hallucinogens. ""Who Could Win A Rabbit"" is perhaps the easiest starting point."
3,Lo Fi drugged up neo folk stew,"At times this psychedelia works, but all too often moments of acoustic pastoral beauty give way to overbearing playing of repetitious pot headed tendencies. The band has some great ideas going for them, utilizing their trapped in a bubble approach to shun traditional songwriting to great effect. The problem comes when the experiments more often then not become self conscious experimentation, coupled right down to their in house vocal effects and often stuttered pace. The opening track was a big grabber for many people, who eventually lost interest throughout the album's subdued strumfest, which indicates a future interest for this collective to elaborate more on it's percussion output, as well as extending their general production values, in order to elevate the stature of this music."
3,please revise for a final draft,"This album has its share of brillaint moments--""leaf house,"" ""who could win a rabbit,"" and ""winter's love"" are some of the most inventive and amazing songs I've heard in the past year. They caputre a regressive psyche with well crafted songs that aide adult listeners in endulging their inner-child. However, these Brian Wilson-esque gems are marred as the find their place alongside other a.c. experiments in which such overflowing creativity is misdirected. ""Visiting Friends"" and ""Whatddit I Done"" are made to float around like ghosts, but are more annoying than they are haunting (they are comprised of minimalistic off-beat guitar strumming). Unfortunatly the weaker songs find 8-12 min lengths while the better songs end around 2 min. That being said, this album is wourth buying for its better half."
3,Not for Repeated Exposure,"Rock music at its most experimental has the potential to be thrilling. Think Eno's Here Come the Warm Jets; the first time you heard the romantic mumble of R.E.M.'s Murmur; Laurie Anderson's minimalist explorations of post-modern life on Big Science. These were artists that found structures to communicate their needs: Eno's dense glam-metal; Michael Stipe's open-souled mumble; Anderson's reductive dissonance and humor. Animal Collective, which is comprised of Panda Bear and Avey Tare, are looking for their structure on their second release Sung Tongs. It begins thrillingly with ""Leaf House"" and ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"" - songs that might have been written by Philip Glass on acid. After that it's folksy weirdness and sound collages and tape manipulations that sound like a baby singing through a mouth-tube. Depending on your taste for strangeness you might just love it. I have my reservations, and love it after a lot of exposure to the mainstream. But not all the time."
4,easily one of the 2004's best,"aside from the sprawling 12 minute track which has it's moments. this album is pure genius. in my eyes, they just keep getting better. seeing them live is always a different amazing experience, and thankfully they not only play fun shows, but record lovely albums....so in a nutshell get this."
5,Flawless,This album is perfect. It's the best vocal record since Pet Sounds. It is on an entirely different level of music than anything else right now.
5,Can't Get This CD Outta My Mind,"This cd grabbed me hard and hasn't let go. It's been way over a year now and I STILL am mesmerized by it. One reviewer said that 20 years from now this would still be talked about and revered. Indeed. Innovative, and Panda and Avery should have their pictures in the dictionary beside the word. It's powerful and soulful and sweet. And definitely not for everybody. ""Feels"" is also good, but ""Sung Tongs"" is the best thing I've heard in at least 10 years. 'Mouth Wooed Her' is exceptional and is my favorite cut."
3,Amazon's stock,"I love this album and ordered the vinyl directly from amazon. The record skipped several times on both side B and side D, leading me to believe this a manufacturer error. I sent mine back and received a replacement from amazon, only to find it had the same problem. This is just a warning to other customers that amazon may have gotten a ""bad batch"" of records from Fat Cat, the skips make some of my favorite songs on this record almost unlistenable."
2,Fair,"If everyone listened to the first few tracks and then ran to the computer to write a review, you'd get a long list of 5 star reviews. The beginning is obnoxious, strong, genius, and completely unique. The majority of the album that follows, however, is comprised of instrumental tracks capable of destroying the beauty of the beginning."
2,"Great hardware (in 2008), bad OS","Please, stop selling this piece of museum. It's very slow, and WinCE 5 makes things harder. When will Micro$oft do a lighter OSs ? Worst : you must have and use Outlook in order to connect your PC with the Asus A626. As allways, you only discover this after opening the box, for sure. Marketing tactics. I am ashamed to tell it, but I was the one who bought the Outlook, for only $80. The connection works when it wants. Please take tons of care with the data backup. If your PC crashes, start praying to don't lose all your data, as happened to me twice. Sorry Asus, sorry Microsoft, you were not fair. I am moving to Android; everything is Beta version, many bugs, but at least I am not paying for it, and all my data will be on the clouds; no more disasters."
3,Loved it... now... not so sure,"When I first bought this about 16 months ago, I loved it... except that it couldn't connect to the internet from my apartment... couldn't synch with my laptop nor could it update when I was able to connect to the internet... but since this was my first PDA, I was happy that it would play movies and entertain me during long trips.When I started learning that the product was suppose to be able to do some of the things that I had initially bought it to do and didn't... well, now my trust factor of all things ASUS have dropped off. I noticed that Dell doesn't offer the item any longer and ASUS doesn't support (nor do they seem to acknowledge it's existence). How wonderful for my naievete... that I didn't persue more of the features... but now it's almost dead in the water except that I can still play solitare and bubble breaker... and when the moon is just right, work the excel program. :) I love life."
1,Not Good,"I purchased this item one year ago to replace my Palm Tungsten E that died. I was looking to sync up my work email and other email. This unit would not keep a Wifi connection and I had to input all the information each time. So, it worked and didn't work. I work in computers and software, and my technical savy coworkers couldn't setup this unit to work properly. The battery life is nill. In addition, the support lacks. There is very little online for troubleshooting. Don't waste your money. Buy a Smartphone instead as I'm doing."
2,REPEATED PROBLEMS,I bought this as a replacement for an old Dell model & this unit has caused me headaches in synching with my computer. It takes a LONG TIME to synch--often needing to delete all Outlook data and start from scratch. Now it doesn't synch at all--and I can't figure out why. It also has problems displaying Word files. I need to convert to simple text files in order to display them.
4,excellent PDA,"I like my ASUS A626 very much. I never have a problem with wi-fi signal strength where I use it. Big bright screen, and all the tools to keep me organized and in touch with email and calendar. And I can get my butt whipped at chess while I ride the bus."
3,asus a626 3.5 pda,"this is an incredible pocket lap top, it's user friendly not many complications, just wish they'd install a stronger signal antenna inside the pda, it would make finding a internet connection so much easier, a great piece of equiptment to have that's more than compact."
1,Slow. Very Slow.,"I had a Palm TX for 2 years, and loved it. But it died. The only additional functionality I wanted in a newer device was ability to play the Windows Media format, since most radio stations will only stream in that format. Unfortunately I bought, and had to return, the Asus A626. It ran extremely slow. I've seen other Windows Mobile devices in the store that run fast enough. But not this dog. Worst of all, it wouldn't play a WMA stream from a major radio station (CKLW), nor would it play any Shoutcast streams. I just bought a new Palm TX."
2,cheap hardware does come with a price,"I wish I can say this is a great bargin but it requires more attention on software support, I wouldn't bet on low price for great software support."
3,Decent product,"It works in a decent form. Like other people said, the wi-fi coverage is poor compared with a laptop, but it connects. Sometimes in my wireless router the connection is interrumpted without reason, but after a while it runs again. I updated to the last OS version provided by Asus (unfortunately not in spanish)and after that the messenger stops to work. So I must connect trough the internet page. It surf the web well, considering the size of the screen. I wanted it to being connected when I'm abroad, and with such a lot of places with wi-fi available now, is usefull for me. Of course, it always depends the needs you have."
1,somewhat disappointed,I chose the product because of price and sometimes the new names might offer something good but this product dissapointed me. I bought it for use to syncronize my nursing drug book from my computer using window XP to the asus PDA but it will not work and the software that came with it will not load into my computer either. I called Asus for help and it was clear to me that the technical team are helpless and offers nothing but poor support. I wish to return it as soon as possible to amazon if there will not be a return fee or I will trash it. the only good thing about the PDA is the wifi but that is not why i need a PDA. so if you are buying for core PDA functions you will be disappointed. The product will not read flash card that has music files because it was not created by ASUS PDA.IT IS REALLY FUNNY. THIS THE ONLY THING I REGRET BUYING FROM AMAZON.
4,Jazz with a Tropical twist,"This CD is just fun to listen too. The musicans are amazing and the songs are great with unique timing and use of their instraments. I was fortunate enough to see this band play live and it was an awesome show. Again the best word to discribe it is fun, you enjoy yourself and have a good time listening to the CD, you want to get up a grove to it while having a margarita."
2,Lightweight and adds very little to our knowledge,"This has to be a great opportunity missed. For many, including myself, Peter Cushing was THE Holmes (after Rathbone) and here was a chance to really detail his performances in the role - especially the BBC series. But the author adds very little to our knowledge of either Peter`s portrayal of the character or the Holmes Canon itself. A pity."
4,"Before Brett and after Rathbone, was Cushing","Tony Earnshaw presents a well-written and thoroughly researched monogram on the late great Peter Cushing's performances as Sherlock Holmes.An Actor and A Rare One is very readable, and insightful book. Lightweight, it presents much information on Cushing's performances in both a factual and critical manner. With lengthy chapters on the Hammer Hound of the Baskervilles, the BBC tv series and on the Masks of Death and proposed follow up, along with a guide to his Holmes performances and a selection of biographies for fellow cast and crew on the productions, this is very much a book for both Cushing and Holmes enthusiasts.An excellent publication, which presents new light on a much-loved actor in one of his finest roles."
1,"Poor use of camera, film, sets, script, actors and studio vehicles","This movie was the worse piece of ""erotic-drama"" to come out yet in 2011. It is another example of someone(s) trying to cash in on an idea rather than any sort of plot. The characters are horribly fake and unnecessary, the backdrop is so cheap it's reminiscent of a porn set, and nothing except the possibility of callow erotica exists in this movie to keep any person with real taste watching this rubbish; and I close with a quote from Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever, ""Watching your neighbor's vacation videos might be less painful. May be redeemed by stretches of unintentional amusement."""
1,"Very, very disappointed","I bought this for my dog last July and it started coming apart at the seams of the 'patchwork' top in just a couple of months. I turned it over and in no time flat, a torn place appeared on the solid back fabric. It's very, very thin cheap fabric. The lining on the inner pad is very, very thin, cheap muslin and came apart as the outer fabric was coming apart. It's been ready for the garbage with green fiber-fill everywhere. I got mine, at Amazon on sale for $23, because it is so very pretty. If they came along for under $10, I might order another one because they're so soft and pretty and comfortable for my very old Rottweiler's bones - and she loved it so she's very disappointed, too. She messes with it seemingly trying to fix it...it's sad. I can tell you this, if I'd paid one cent more for it, I'd have returned it right then and there the day it was delivered!"
2,Washed it once....,"This bed was great-looking, my dog loved it...until I had to wash the cover. Under gentle, the patchwork all came apart. What dog bed does NOT have to be washed??? She's now lying on the inside part & is just as happy. Me, not so much."
1,BOO i had to read it!,I thought this book was really cheezball..... i think it deserves to be burnt!
1,get the chessy with it?,"DONT READ IT...DONT LOOK AT IT....DONT BORROW IT...DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT... if u are a ally fan this book will scorch ur poor little simple minds that u will never want to watch, hear or even see the ally mcbeal show again... so WARNING TO ALL ALLY MCBEAL FANS DONT READ IT!"
5,SMARTLY DELINEATES BETWEEN TRUE CHRISTIAN THINKING & MUSH.,"BLAMIRES, LIKE HIS TUTOR C. S. LEWIS, HAS A WONDERFUL KNACK FOR DEFINING & THEN CONFRONTING HIS SUBJECT. THE FIRST 1/2 OF HIS BOOK SUPORTS HIS MAIN HYPOTHESIS: ""THERE IS NO LONGER A CHRISTIAN MIND"". THERE IS A CHRISTIAN ETHIC & A CHRISTIAN WORSHIP, BUT THERE IS NO LONGER A CHRISTIAN MIND WHICH IS GIVEN SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IN THE MARKETPLACE OF INTELLIGENT THINKING. THIS IS BECAUSE THE CHRISTIAN MIND HAS LOST IT'S DISTINCTION HAVING SUCCOM TO SECULARIZATION. THE 2ND 1/2 OF HIS BOOK DEFINES WHAT THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHRISTIAN MIND WOULD BE IF SUCH EXISTED. NOTE, BLAMIRES INITIALLY WROTE THIS BOOK IN THE 1960'S BUT IT IS STILL FRESH AND RELEVANT TODAY 30 YEARS LATER."
2,Most Esoteric Trivia Game EV-ER....,"My mom bought this for me knowing that I am a Simpsons fan and have been for 15 years. However, the questions are completely obscure and there is no ""game"" to this game. It is a game only the most extreme Simpsons aficionado could understand, let alone enjoy. If you think you know anything about the Simpsons, don't buy this. You'll just get a little angry about your lack of knowledge as only the ""Comic Book Guy"" could have any success at this ""game""."
3,Slightly Damaged.,"This was a great game, included everything shown in the picture, but the packaging was banged up and was poorly wrapped."
1,Too confusing to even bother with,"The game is way too confusing to follow, which takes away all the fun of playing a trivia game. A big fat raspberry for this one...sorry."
4,Wow,"the sword shipped next day, due to where i live i guess. the blade itself is impressive, and by impressive i mean massive. the stated weight is 17 pounds, but its easily 22-25. the blade is dulled, id assum due to liability reasons. i havnt sharpened it, because whats the point? the thing is so large, its idiotic to run around tryin to slash things. it may be battle ready, but i wont be testing it. other than that, i love it."
3,Hand gaurd blows,"It's an awesome swords. Big and wide. heavy as hell, but the hand guard sucks. My came loose as soon as opened it. no sheath either, but man is it impressive."
4,PTERODACTYL PTERODACTYL DOR ME VOUS,"This made for SCIFI Channel thriller is quite entertaining for movies of its ilk. The special effects are pretty cool and the cast gamely engages in some ridiculous dialogue and action, but hey this is a giant dinosaur movie---who wants art? Cameron Daddo plays a paleontologist who is taking some of his students on an expedition on the Turkish/Armenian border. Amy Sloan plays Kate, his graduate student and would be lover. Also in the area is a special ops force out to take custody of a rebel leader. Of course as the movie progresses, the two parties of people converge to battle the army of pterodactyls, released by an earthquake in a volcano. There's lots of blood and guts as the nasty birdies engage in their predatory feeding, and lots of tense who's gonna get it scenes? While hardly a work of classic stature, PTERODACTYL provided the thrills and action I like in this kind of distracting movie."
1,"FUNNY AS HELL, BUT ITS A HORROR MOVIE.........","So I'm at my friends and we see a copy of this movie on his table. Apparently his neighbor rented or bought it, and was lending it to him. Moments later, I was laughing so hard I was in tears, as this is ""horror"" movie, is so f--king bad its good. The plot is simple, 3 college kids, their teacher and his ""friend"" go exploring in some forest in Turkey. Unfortunatley for them the forest is A) Camp ground for a bunch of terrorists B) US Special forces, led by some rapper, are raiding the area and C) Prehistoric dinosaurs are flying around murdering anyone they see. Thus most of the cast is murdered in comically stupid ways, by poorly animated dinosaurs. I don't want to give any spoilers but lets just say you will be rewinding several times saying ""OMG that did NOT just happen hahahahahahaha"".I had to give this movie 1 star because its labeled a horror movie and it is 100% not scary. Relabel it a comedy and I will give it 5 stars."
4,Caught me by surprise..!!,"Give this director another creature movie to direct please. Iwas ready to be entertained but this creature movie blew meaway with the great CGI, gore and action. The birds are predators and are hungry...and we get to see what we want to see and not just quick edits thats leaves the audience dizzy.Descent acting, good monsters and a story....get your popcornready monster fans as you wont fall asleep on this one."
4,High body count starting from the beginning,"This movie doesn't have much of a plot or at least a plot that you can figure out but it is very entertaining. The whole movie is a series of scenes where the characters are running and screaming as they are being chased by groups of large pterodactyl birds. The characters are picked off one at a time by the birds until the very end where there are only two characters left. The two characters are scientists. By the end of the movie, these two scientists manage to kill the male leader of the flock of pterodactyls but most of the female birds are still flying around somewhere. The movie ends with an egg hatching which is supposed to mean that a new male leader is born. I know that I gave away most of the movie but it is worth renting or buying for the entertainment value it presents."
2,"Fun, like candy","Okay, like almost all of SciFi Channel's ""originals,"" this is a steaming pile of cinematic feces, the hoary old plot gimmick this time being frozen dino eggs thawing and hatching. But I will admit that the writers had fun with their character's names. Almost all of their names were famous science fiction writers: Lovecraft, Serling, Heinlein, Yolen, Bradbury, Lem, Zelazny, Donaldson, Burroughs, Clarke, and Herbert.Oh, and it should've been called Pteranodon, since pterodactyls didn't have the backward pointing crest."
3,a good little chomp fest,"A neat little flying monster B movie.Considering it was made for TV, it's well made.Basic story is about a bunch of college students on a field trip becoming lunch for a bunch of pterodactyle's. The FX is very good considering the low budget.The actors did a passing job, although the self centered (im gods gift to men)big boobed blonde was a pain in the ass.It was good to see her chowed on by the flying reptiles.The film,has tons of gore(heads ripped of,bodies ripped in half and entrails flying in the breeze).Even a group of special forces tough guys are a feast for the ptero's.Hell I was rooting for the flying meat munchers. Almost as good as ""Q"",the David Carradine flying monster gem of the 90's."
4,Pterodactyl,I have not viewed this DVD yet but it appears to be in great condition as it stated when I ordered it
4,Good,a good time waster but a good B Movie none the less its about a group of scientists or archeologist on an expadition and like Pteradactyls get loose and start attacking people its a great time killer
3,Not the same thermostat.,"Thermostat is high quality, works well, and was easy to install, but it is NOT the one described. It's a plain off-white plastic with a big-handled knob. Since it was for my formal dining room, it doesn't look as nice as expected. I needed to replace the existing thermostat right away, so I couldn't return it, but I may end up buying a nicer one to replace it and move this one to a different room. I just won't buy the new one from this supplier."
5,A Quality Product,"I bought this about a week or so ago after researching several models of weather radio. Unlike complaints I've read about other brands, this radio was easy to set up, and there should be no problems concerning battery life due to a nice standby mode. I'd definitely recommend this radio to anyone looking for a quality, affordable weather radio."
1,Unresolved Complaint,"Last year I purchased a WR103NX weather radio from Oregon Scientific. There was a recall 4 to 5 months ago and I returned my unit. It was never returned to me. I have spent hours on the phone, been promised it would be shipped, been promised an upgrade, hung up on, and generally lied to for the last two months. I can get no satisfaction. They will not return my calls. It looks like I am out a radio. I plan to write letters to all the major newspapers in Florida where I live and let them know about my experience. In a state such as Florida, where storms are more or less common a person should never buy a weather radio from this company and expect service."
3,Ok I guess...,"We bought this so we can find a NOAA channel easily when on car trips. It serves its purpose, but there are a couple of things that just aren't as great as our larger, stay-put Midland. For example, the Midland allows you to program which kinds of alerts you want to receive. I don't know if any other hand-held gives you that option, but it sure would be nice. You can set it to mute, but the flashing light is tiny. When I'm in my home county, I take it with me when the weather looks bad and set it to turn the radio on if an alert is issued.This radio comes with an AC adaptor but IS NOT RECHARGABLE--I sure wish it were! Anyway, it does what I want it to do, but it could be so much better!"
1,No On/Off switch a turn off,Unfortunatly the fact that this weather radio doesn't have an on/off switch but a snooze button instead is a big turn off for me. I have seen many weather radios being a storm chaser and never seen one that didn't have an On/Off switch. It's battery powered so why wouldn't you put an on/off switch on it! If your looking for a radio for home use this maybe the one for you if you can afford the batteries. But if your looking to take it with you everywhere this is not the model for you. After emailing the company about this their claim was it was an alert radio so thats why it has no on/off switch! But to be painfully honest if it's an alert radio what's with the snooze button. After buying one of oregon sceintifics handhelds and taking for granted it would have a on/off switch I won't buy another one ever until they provide it.
3,Graham,Its ok but should have some knid of writing on each. They dont sell the item in orange that really suck because i have white and yellow walls.
2,Doesn't provide what it is marketed as,"This book is marketed as a book for DNS and WINS emergencies (disaster recovery). Its title ""admin 911"" with flashing red siren indicates its purpose is for providing emergency repair and restoration information of DNS and WINS. I would say around 10 pages of the ENTIRE 375 page book is dedicated for this subject.Cutting edge methdology for repairing DNS and WINS are not mentioned at all. The book should have contained case studies and scenarios on how DNS and WINS can be best fixed. Instead, the author talks about what DNS and WINS is and how it functions.If you want to know what DNS and WINS are, then this is not a bad book to get. But if you want to understand and write scripts for disaster recovery of DNS and WINS, look elsewhere."
3,Good example of applying investigative method to poetry,This is a little tome. Clocks in at 11 pages. It is probably of more interest to poets than to historians. But Williams does uncover some little known facts and he applies a novel technique in order to cast light upon the failed Hitler assasain Johann Georg Elser. Works like Williams' are in the forefont of a poetry style known as investigative poetry. The I.P school was founded by Ed Sanders. A central tenet: To relieve poetry of its obsessive preoccupation with egoistic internal states and to focus content around things that really happened.
2,few maps or balance,"Well I've played all of the Unreal Tournament games and most of the quake games so I'm a fair judge of FPSs. This game doesn't really have many maps or modes of play. It tries to add some elements from Battlefield 2142 but kinda fails, you don't even keep you extra skill from one battle to the next, so you start from scratch each time. The strog have vehicles that make the human ones look like jokes in how fast they fire and how much damage they do. The graphics are really nice though and it doesn't seem to tax my graphics card as much as some other games do. For all you get in it, it should be a mid budget game of $29.95 and not more."
3,Something was lost,"Overall, this game is a fantastic combination of infantry and armor. There is plenty of room for strategy, and many variations on approaches to accomplishing the missions.However, there seems to be something lost from the original Enemy Territory game. Something changed while updating that dimmed the addictive-ness. It is probably just my perception of it. Unfortunately, I've had more fun with Call of Duty 4, despite it's repetitive nature and lack of objective focus."
4,Quake Wars,"Para la gente que gusta de los juegos del espacio, de alienigenas super avanzadas y de militares humanos del futuro lejano. Es un juego donde se tiene que aprender los objetivos, no se trata de disparar y preguntar luego. Aparte de los vehiculos que se pueden usar para aumentar el poder de ataque, que van desde motos hasta helicopteros. Juego recomendado para las personas que no tienen máquinas tan poderosas."
5,This game is a blast!,This is such a great game that is still going strong. There are still enough players out there that you can find a full server most times of the day.The only negative is the lack of maps. There are six maps total I think.It's better than 2142 which is the other FPS that is most similar to it.
4,Fun game and cheap,"This is a great game for the price. It has good graphics that aren't that taxing on your system. There is a learning curve as with any classed based FPS but I love class FPS's online. Very fun once you know what you are doing and at that price, it makes it even better."
4,hey,"I have had this game since it came out butt never play it much. Iplayed today for along time, there is more players had agreat time. with all the crudy games that have come out since after call of duty 4,this is asleeper you shoud give a try."
3,fun multiplayer but only if...,id recommend this game on one condition. you dont like mindless fragfests. only buy this if you like kill swarms of people in order to complete an objective. kind of a steep learning curve so be prepared. all the work might be worth it. i quit playing it practically right after i bought it. dont buy this because there are many better games out there. call of duty 4 for example. or team fortress.
2,Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory for the 21st Century,"There was a lot of prerelease spin for this game, and some of it was apt. Splash Damage has taken Wofenstein-ET with the Doom 3 engine and the Quake plot line, pumped the grpx engine full of visual steroids but sent the writers and creative consultants home way too early. The game has really nice eye candy, and runs well on my notebook (nice surprise) but I was honestly expecting more plot and more 'Meat' to this newest addition to the Quake family.Maybe it was just me but, from what I was reading, prior to release I got the impression that this game was going to give us a lot of 'back-story' and the reason we 'Went to War' (hehehe) in Quake 3. Unfortunately, this game (like the reasons WE were given for going to war) fall far short of the commitment that WE gamers usually make in a title. Bottom line; this game can be a nice reminder of Wolfenstein-ET, but will not stay long in you game rotation."
1,Total garbage...the death of Quake.,"This is the final nail in ID's coffin. Quake is offically dead. How could the company that gave us Catacombs, Wolfenstein 3d, Doom, Doom II, Final Doom, Quake, Hexen, Hexen II and Heretic give us such garbage over the last few years like Quake 2, Quake 3, Quake 4 WTF!!!, Doom 3, Heretic II and now this piece of trash. If you want to make these games make them but don't ruin them but slapping a Quake/Doom logo on them to sell them, that only makes fans think you sold out and are now making horrid games.....which you are. Id have served their purpose now they have been bought out, hopefully we will see some respect and dignity and most of all fun brought back to Doom, and maybe a real sequel to Quake 1."
5,QUAKE!!!!,Enemy Territory has arrived with an atomic bang. The quake universe is now chronicled in this intense action shooter. The Design of the game makes team mates work together to clench victory and survive. Its the ultimate team based Online shooter.
2,game review,this is not the funest game to play I would go with a different quake game instead of this one
2,not as good as i expected,"This was not what i expected, the grafics is nice but not really a new relvolution and the taktics and new level of teamplay they talked so much about is practicly non existent. The stearing of figures and vehicles is ok but nothing special.So its no wonder that i was a bit dissapointed when i finaly got the game on my pc. But there r good points too, i like the fact the both side have different vehicles and weapons and that the game i running very good on my not so new pc (Pentium 3,0 GHz / Nvidea 6700XL).My conclusion, this game is only for Quake fans and Clan Players and not for mr. averrage and instance gamers. So its not a real contender for Battlefield 2142, the current leader of egoshooters."
2,Clans will pwn u,"I been home with broken leg for two months and I've been playing this game, beta then demo, a lot. I have more than a hundred hours experience. It is like BF 2142. I like the game but I see one problem which will keep me from buying. No good comm system. Clanners are using TeamSpeak, etc., non clanners can't compete. With Teamspeak and your clan members you will own all. So makes a very one sided multiplayer experience. If you are in a clan buy, if not be ware you will not make many points.Also takes above average intelligence, so if not B student you will not be happy. ( Like my brother, who quit after two days ).Single player bots are as dumb as dirt. So single player is a one day event. Could have been 4 stars with VOIP."
3,"Decent, but hardly memorable. I was waiting for some fire!","I bought this CD not knowing what to expect. I knew Coryell has some real intense stuff, and a duo with sax has potential. It left me wondering, what if... What if they were to stretch out some, and blow some cob webs off their instruments. I guess we'll never know."
2,"not a workout, just fun for baby",My baby loves the exercises in this so it is nice to keep him occupied and happy for 15minutes but dont expect a workout. The title is misleading. The music is bad and the set is bad. I had the perfect Pregnancy workout dvd with Karyne Steben as well and liked it alot more than this but at least baby likes.
2,Disappointing,Since I loved Steben's Perfect Pregnancy workout I got this as a postnatal video and thought it would be a great way to lose the baby fat and spend time with my baby. Disappointed - only used it a couple of times.
5,Please see our other reviews,Amazon is in the process of moving our product information and reviews here from the VHS listing. Please find out more information about this great DVD there!
5,My son is 10 months old...not too late.,I wish I had this DVD as soon as my son was born. I lost my pregnancy weight within three weeks of his birth from nursing yet I was overweight before I was pregnant so I had more to lose. My legs got smaller but my stomach was different and bigger as it is after having a baby. Grant is now 10 months old and I decided to do something about it. I was terribly out of shape and this video is wonderful. It is a great starter point. It is difficult starting now because my son is 27 pounds. It's a lot of weight to start with. I would suggest this video shortly after your child is born. It would be much easier to start with a 10 pound baby. My son just smiles and loves doing this with me. If he gets antsy he crawls away for awhile...but he always comes back for more.
3,good for designing your own baby workout,"I personally didn't find these workouts helpful and actually injured myself trying the first workout too soon after birth.However, the way she integrates the baby into the workout actually inspired me to come up with my own set of exercises (actually from Pilates for Moms DVD)which involve the baby. Being able to do even 15 minutes of exercise with the baby included is definitely important in the first few months after birth. So the idea is there, but the workout isn't great.I will say, however, that I loved her prenatal workout. If you're looking for a good postnatal workout, I'd recommend Pilates for Moms over this one."
4,Simple but work.,It is a simple guide but works well to my body.The baby can be some weight for our loosen muscle!My baby enjoyed some exercises with me.
2,Poor quality production.,My wife only got a few minutes into this work out and was dissapointed by the poor quality of the production. She returned it.
3,Not so great. Ok for the 1st week back.,"I used this ""workout"" during the 1st 2 weeks after giving birth. After that, it was way too easy and boring. I wouldn't recommend this if you have been exercising regularly throughout your pregnancy. It's quite easy. However, if you want to use it for the very 1st few days or weeks just to get yourself back into the mindset of working out, it could be beneficial.I LOVED the workout of hers designed for DURING the pregnancy. That video was VERY challenging, yet soothing. I used it almost every day, plus added some cardio every other day.The post pregnancy workout was, therefore, a bit of a letdown."
2,My baby was not down for this,I liked her other prenatal workout but this one was not as good. The whole thing isn't as professional as her first workout. It didn't really work for me and my daughter cried through the entire thing. I had to just sit and watch the video. I would look into other mom and baby options. But every baby is different. maybe your baby will like it.
3,First Baby,It's been hard to make it to the gym since my daughter was born. I was looking for an exercise dvd I could do with the baby that would help me get back into shape. This dvd was not as challenging as I hoped. I would recommend this for mothers looking for a light workout with the baby. Perhaps this dvd would have been more ideal 2 months ago. My daughter is now almost 4 months old.
4,This must be a pseudonym for a different writer,"The writing in this book is too good, too polished for me to believe that it was written by a virtual unknown. Excellent writing - very violent, sexual, yet fluid and mesmerizing. If you can find this book, disregard the cover and pick it up. Great character development and a moving plot.I picked it up on a whim, and it is one of the most well-wriiten books that I have ever come accross."
4,Bible Study - NRSV,"Workhorse Bible for study of the NSRV, one of the solid modern English translations. Great for teenagers alone or for adults in conjunction with other study Bibles, such as Harpers, and alongside other translations."
5,Great Bible,"My wife and I spent weeks looking for a good Bible that we could use for a daily Bible study. This Bible is exactly what we were looking for. The reading plans are good tools, and the comments thoughtout the text are wonderful. We are very happy with this Bible."
4,Educational approach,Very useful edition is you like learning more about how different passages of the Bible might be interpreted and understood.I enjoy using it.
5,The only good grindcore album on the planet!,"I was really surprised when I first heard this. The music is basically punk rock sped up until it sounds like an atomic bomb going off. And the vocals sound(out of sheer anger maybe) like extremely (yes ""extreme"" is a good word here) rabid animal noises. I mean, these people tryed just so HARD at this that its amazing.This album by the way, is one of John Zorn's (avant-garde-jazz-hardcore-noise-S&M composer) favorite albums.John Zorn made a list of his favorite musicians/bands and listed Extreme Noise Terror next to Frank Sinatra and Conway Twitty."
2,"Aged, aged, aged","Although having been at its moment an useful title for everybody interested in knowing deeper the secrets of the liturgy of offerings of the ancient Egyptians, so widely represented in every kind of funereal item, this book has seen its decline and death for the general public and it is of little use for the specialist. If a newcomer, be extremely careful; if not, well, you will notice what is still useful."
1,WARNING: Don't buy this album,"This is the worst album I've ever heard. It sounds like they gathered up a bunch of people who have never been into music before, taught them a few chords and recorded this album by using a PC Mic. The people who screw up DMB's music in this album can't play and can't sing, and also the recording quality is awful. Stay far away from it."
1,Don't Take MY Word For It,Don't even think about buying this album!!!I'm not going to rant and rave about the lack of talent of these artists and their deviation from the heavenly tunes of dMb--and I could. And I'm not going to expound on the sickening trend of free-loading bums trying to make a buck off of dMb's success--even though they're so transparent that it's too easy. What I will do is encourage the potential buyer to look at other reviews from more reliable sources:PLEASE-PLEASE-PLEASE read reviews of this item on nancies.org and the iTunes music store before supporting this bunco artists!Thanks!
4,decent plugs,"Copper core burn hotter then platinum plugs but does have a downside, they dont last as long. with that said change them every year... At the current price should be easy to do"
4,sparkplug misinformation,Read ad carefully as you may be buying one plug. Found these plugs cheaper at Autozone and Oreilys auto parts. Check sparkplug tips as this can be done at autoparts stores before buying. Plugs are much cheaper then Platinum but to me last just as long. No problems due to these sparkplugs as of yet
1,"""FLAT PACK"" refers to 1 plug not a pack of plugs","i thought i was getting a pack of 4 plugs, i didnt read what they had written, $5.15 great price for 4 plugs, terrible price for 1 plug."
1,let down,"when i recieved the data cord it was damamged, and the utilities and drivers cd couldnt be recognized by my computer.my guess it was the size becouse it was a lot smaller than a usual cd. i just wanted to transfer some sound and image files to my phone. not happy at all."
1,HarmonTec DV-105 dvd player,Don't waste your money on this player. The remote worked only 1 time.There's no support from the company. Buyer beware!
3,ok product,Very good service I got it on time however The remote stopped working in only six months and I could not use the buttons on the DVD player they would not work.
5,La Crosse Technology WS-9210U-BP Wireless Temperature Station,"This is the second LaCrosse product I have purchased. The first has given me 3 years of quality service and I expect it will provide many more. It is easy to set-up as long as you read and follow the instructions. Once set, the only maintenance is battery replacement. The indoor display lasts about a year on a set of batteries. The outdoor sensor lasts about 6-8 months here in Massachusetts. But, considering our weather I think that is great."
3,Saw Blade,"It took longer than I expected for delivery.Due to Hurricane Ike, I have not installed the blade yet. It looks like a good deal, but time will tell."
4,Good Destroyer Book,"Book is excellent and exactly what I was looking for, the only thing that stops me from loving it is that the seller put a non removable sticker on the spine of the book. boo."
1,A True Disappointment,"Becker, who is known for the book Jacob the Liar, starts out with a fascinating premise: a son of a Holocaust survivor, residing in E. Germany, finds that his father and some friends are holding a former concentration camp guard a prisoner in a cabin. It is the 1970's, and the son wrestles with this information. What, if anything, should he do? Unfortunately, the premise is the only worthwhile thing about his book. It just does not deliver. The characters, especially the son, is superficial, not drawn with much, if any, depth. I couldn't figure out why the son even cared about what his father was doing; he didn't seem to care about much else. This book was a real disappointment."
3,its whatever,I'm a big chalie boy fan but this in nothing like the the VMT with Rapid Ric its alot of tracks that aint even CB.Its okay and i want to support that artists but hell name it something else if its tracks by other artist on there i was under the impression that CB was gonna rip all the tracks. If you must have some new CB go for it ! If you wanna save your money its a smart move.
1,STILL WAITING,"This was ordered 3/11/2010 and charged to my credit card. On 4/3/2010, I was still waiting for this and contacted the supplier, who promised to ship or return my money. I am still waiting as of 4/14/2010, I have not received either one. I ordered from other suppliers on the same day as this order and received the orders without any difficulty. I would not order from mab again.4/22/2010 Finally received a refund and also received $10 credit for mab."
3,ok,"I think this DVD (and other lick based teaching tools) is good for getting out of a rut. If everything you play sounds the same, a lick based tool can cause you to look at the changes differently. I was a little disappointed when I discovered that two licks are almost exactly the same and I'm only up to lick 17 of 50! If they are going to demo only 50 jazz licks, you would expect a little more variation. Lick 1 and lick 17 are essentially the same. 1 over major and 17 over minor. Mr. Vignola is a very good player and just watching him play can teach a lot. I may update my review after making my way through the entire dvd."
4,Excellent compilation of Basics on Aeordynamics,"As a reader without a formal engineering background, I found this book to be a good primer in aerodynamics. Although challenging, the theory is accessible and the mathematics practical. I have found no other material that serves as well as an introduction to the theory and practice of race car aero concepts."
5,Down-under Police Mysteries Review,"These episodes of crime and justice down-under are very well done, riveting, and enlightening. The friction between Aussies and immigrants is eye opening so say the least.The only improvement in their presentations would be to add the option of english sub-titles for those of us who have a tough time picking up their accent."
1,"Ann Margaret is great, but doesn't save this project","I love ann Margaret, she's a lounge singer legend, however I'd rather hear her sing the lounge classic ""13 Men"". Gospel music should be sung by Roy Rogers & Dale evans, Ann should be singing Cole Porter and Gershwin, better luck next time, Ann baby..."
2,The only good thing in this is James. Purefoy,"Bought this for Mr. Purefoy. The movie is horrid, sorry! Though James plays his role to perfection, I didn't like the movie as a whole. If you're a Purefoy fan, I highly recommend purchasing this though. His character is throughout and it's definitely necessary as part of your collection. But I wish overall it could have been better."
5,Great color and it's waterproof.,"I love this watch. It's feminine and not too clunky. But, still great for everyday wear. During the summer I never take it off. It gets showered on, swam in, etc and keeps right on ticking!"
1,Broken bottle,"The bottle was well wrapped in bubble wrap, but is smashed and had zillion small bits of glass underneath the wrapping. It might have been broken before mailing. I should have returned it. Won't buy again, better off going to the store, and pay a bit more."
5,Excellent for Keyboards,This is a great way to clean dust off delicate places all around the computer without having to drag around a vacuum cleaner and it doesn't harm the computer in the process.Use caution and good ventilation.Recommended.
1,Great product ruined,"I used to use this product regularly; now with the added bittering agent, I can't even go near it. I cleaned my mouse and keyboard three days ago and still today, when I ate lunch at my desk, my food tasted horrible because it was on my hands and I couldn't get it off. It seems to be gaining in strength. I am very disappointed that 3M ruined a good product for the health benefits to people who, if they want it that bad, will probably just inhale the bittering agent anyway. What a shame."
1,Nasty Bittering agent...,"I used this yesterday on my computer. I noticed several times today that when I licked my lips, I had this awful taste that won't go away. When I googled this, several people had this same issue and had tried actually touching their tongue to the surface they cleaned to see if it could be the culprit and sure enough. I will NEVER use this again. The taste is absolutely awful. I cannot get it off of my hands, the keyboard or my lips."
1,Bittering agent renders product unuseable,"Completely agree with the above comments on the bittering agent. This product was handy and a great idea, until 3M caved to the pressure to keep morons from damaging themselves. The trick to using this canned air without ruining your keyboard is to keep the can upright at all times while using. That'll keep the bittering agent in the can. If any moisture comes through the nozzle, you've effectively covered the item you're spraying, and in my case the keyboard, so you're stuck with the bitter taste for... well, ever. Now: Try to clean a keyboard with a vertical can -- tough, huh? 3M says you can remove this with a 50/50 mix of alcohol and water, and remove the taste with dairy products. I'm going to drink my milk, wash my keyboard with alcohol and water, and toss the 6-pack of compressed air into the trash. Might be good to keep your dog from licking his paws....Under no circumstances would I recommend this product."
1,yuk,"I understand we have to protect idiots from themselves however the bittering agent is awful. I cleaned up my keyboard over a month ago and I have since wiped it down several times but every time I use it I have to be sure to wash my hands well or I end up with that awful stuff everywhere. Have you ever had it in your eyes! Major ouchies. Is there any way to get it off the keys, the mouse and all?"
2,Bittering Agent is horrible,"This works well as a spray but soon afterwards, the room will be filled with stinky and bitter air. You can taste the bitterness in your mouth and when you lick your lips. It takes a while to go away too."
1,Terrible terrible product.,I agree with the other reviews. What was once a great product is now ruined. The bittering agent has me hacking my lungs out and I can't get the taste out of my mouth. I literally feel sick. I will NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.
1,The bittering agent is NASTY,Please I just want to know how to get rid of the taste. All I did was clean my keyboard over 12 hours ago and my lips are still burning and I can't get rid of the taste. This is awful.
5,the best lipbalm ever!,"This is my favourite lip balm with SPF. It has a pleasant vanilla flavour, not too overpowering, cute little package (the fact that it's oval and not round makes it extra-super cute) and what's most important, it has a broad UV protection with zinc oxide, unlike most chapsticks out there. Perfect to wear alone or under a lip gloss. Will never look for another lip balm again!"
4,Certainly not elevator music!,".....unless you want to travel up 100 floors and bring a lunch! Easy listening with a mastery of the keyboards, your mind fills in the words as you blissfully glide through each memory. You picture John or Paul sitting at the keyboard developing the timeless melody lines of these ever popular compositions that stand alone. They can never be ""reduced"", in fact they envelop the room and are a perfect complement to conversations or relaxation with guests (or guest). I am ordering the volume II and suggest getting both at once and saving the shipping!"
1,OVER INDULGENT NOISE!,"GIOVANNI NEEDS HIS EMPTY SKULL KICKED IN FOR REDUCING CLASSIC BEATLES SONG TO MUZAK. ANYONE WHO WOULD ENJOY THIS GARBAGE HAS ABSOLOUTLY NO TASTE WHAT-SO-EVER ( AND SHOULD HAVE THEIR EMPTY SCULL STOMPED, RIGHT AFTER GIONANNI'S)."
2,Boo Hoo Birdy,"i read Catherine Called Birdy and it wasn't that good because it was written in old style English. I found it hard to understand. It was written as a diary and in some entries catherine only explained a few things, in one month it was just a chapter of different feasts which were a bit boring. Also she kept going on and on about how this lady, Morwenna, was allways making her do sewing that got on my nerves after a while. i'm not sure that i will read that many more historical novels."
5,stony foxy,This is a great story about a boy named Little Willy and his grandfather who run a potato farm along with the help of their dog searchlight.One day Grandfather get`s sick. What Little Willy do? What can he do? Find out when you read this great book!
5,I really like them,"These pens have a bold line, don't scratch, and actually don't smell toxic like so many others do. I really like them and will definitely buy another batch when these are used up. I highly recommend them."
1,Not helpful at all,"On my recent trip to Alaska, I've tried many travel guides and planners, free or not. But this has to be one of the worst. It ranks below even the Milepost, which is itself pretty bad.As with the Milepost, this book provides information which may be had free of charge from many other sources. To make matters worse, community descriptions are incomplete or perfunctory.Avoid it."
4,Slapstick opera,"If the Marx Brothers were to write an opera it might come out like this one. Prokofiev's wacky, quirky Love of Three Oranges is a strange trip into something between a fairy tale, satire and farce. The L'Opera de Lyon's production gives this tale of the hypochodriac Prince and his triple-citrus curse a sort of ""twenties chic"" look. Despite its silliness there is at least one truly chilling moment when Fata Morgana, the witch fresh from Hell, gives the Prince the curse of the three oranges. Biting, acid music, a bizzare story and the most slapstick you've ever seen in an opera make this a totally unique and entertaining experience."
2,Nice but smelly,"This scarf is made of rabbit hair I think. It's really nice but has an interesting smell. I've tried letting it sit and air out and the smell has lessened, but perhaps spraying perfume on it would get rid of it."
4,Great Product,"I love this product. It give me an extended range that I need. The design is nice and both item work well. I am use to having the number key on the side, if this feature can be added, it would get 5 stars."
3,"great, until the function keys stopped working","Great keyboard, comfortable - loved the little mousepad. Was great for browsing from the couch, and integrated well with Media Center. The mouse is also comfortable, stylish, with a side buttons for added functions.Too bad all the touch-sensitive keys on the keyboard (look closely, this includes all function keys, home, end, the mouse pad, etc etc) stopped working. This rendered the entire keyboard unusable.I still use the mouse, and would have given this item 5 stars if the keyboard still worked as it initially did."
4,Great Range! Minor issues with key designs,"Pros:Very long range. It's true, it's as long as 30ft as stated. I use it in my living room in combination with a projector screen. I can even use it in my loft room on 2nd floor.The touchpad on they keyboard is very handy.Cons:Some design issues with the keys.All the functional keys (F1, F2 etc) as well as the ESC, Home and End are touch sensitive keys instead of normal keys. It's very easy to unintentionally press them without knowing it. The position of the F1 key is where the ESC key is on a normal keyboard, it's very easy to mis-press.The magnifier doesn't really work with Vista Aero. It causes the screen to flick."
1,Terrible!,"I bought this product to replace an existing non-Bluetooth wireless keyboard/mouse set, as well as an existing Bluetooth PC receiver I used with a couple of audio headsets.Long story short, the Microsoft receiver either wouldn't pair to my existing Bluetooth devices, or it would pair and they still didn't work. To make matters worse, documentation is sparse and online support info is virtually non-existent (I ran into lots of instances of the exact same problem, but no solutions.)Finally, I tried getting support via e-mail from Microsoft, but they were clueless and all but admitted that they couldn't guarantee their receiver would work with anything but their keyboard and mouse. After two weeks of trying to fix things, I decided to return the product while I still could.Save yourself time and trouble and steer clear of the Microsoft Entertainment Desktop 7000."
1,Very frustrated,"This keyboard has been one of the most frustrating devices I have ever owned. It often repeats keys multiple times when typing if I am using the keyboard from more than six feet away. I have already spent 5 times as long typing this review as I should due to this problem. Here's an example: This is an unedited sennnnnnnnntece ttttttyping from moreee than six feeeeeeeet awaay wiith the keybboarrd. I initially bought this keyboard to use with a htpc setup. I spend most of the time watching videos, movies, editing pictures and surfing the net. So I tolerate it(although I know one day it's going to end up in a million pieces on the floor)It is very frustration to use this keyboard and I can't recommend it to anyone."
3,pretty good...,My husband and I have differing experiences with this keyboard. I mostly like it - very sensitive and once you learn how it responds best is pretty good. My husband finds it difficult and is unhappy with the range at which it is useful.
5,Does the job,"I've been using this keyboard/mouse for about a month and have been pretty impressed. I sit about 10 ft. from my system and the response rate is indistinguishable from a wired setup. I love how slim the keyboard is and using 4 lithium batteries it's light as a feather. The mouse works well and its included charger is nice. A pleasant surprise: the touchpad works quite well! It takes a little practice because unlike a laptop touchpad it is (I assume) designed to be used with your right thumb (lefties take note). It's smaller than a normal touchpad, but with a little practice I've learned how to quickly ""flick"" the cursor across the screen. I find myself using the mouse less and less.Bottom line: if you're looking for a reasonably priced, reliable wireless solution for a PC that's attached to your home entertainment system, this is hard to beat."
5,Cant believe how well this worked,This product is awesome! I took it out of the box and had it set up in 10 minutes max. The touch pad is a little small for any mouse heavy activities but great for selecting what movie you want to watch and it fits in a lap with no problems. I highly recommend this product especially for any one with HTPC.
1,Item received is worthless to me,"The item pictured was exactly what I needed and was familiar with. However, I didn't receive the item pictured. I received something different that is worthless to me. Another 65.00 down the drain. Careful what you buy on Amazon evidently. Hopefully the trash collector can use this heap of garbage."
2,Microsoft Entertainment wireless 7000 NOT FUN,"Don't be mislead by it's sleak size and look, the first thing you'll miss is no number pad, just the numbers across the top. The keys are low set, so it's very easy to hit something wrong, BUT, by far, the worst is that the keyboard will not put the numbers(and sometimes letters) where you want them, and put them in places like the address bar, or any open box above the address bar, and even take you completely out of your program, or back to it's home page (at the very least)Now it does not always do this,BUT IT DOES IT A LOT,and mostly when you are in the middle of important work. It will drive you nuts re-doing your work multiple times, so in general don't let it's good looks fool you. I think MS has more work to do on this keyboard"
1,TRAVESTY PART II,"AGAIN I AM FORCED TO GIVE 1 STAR DUE TO THERE BEING NO 0 STAR OPTION. I had to come back and say that Jose Luis Rodriguez sold out even more to make a buck and use these songs to give a boost to his pretty much DEAD CAREER. At least on this disc, the computer manipulation of the original vocals is more flowing, but still not quite the same as the original recording. Another vain, dry attempt to give live to something that is not there. If you want to hear these songs, there are dozens of CD's made that are wonderfully remastered and have all the original heart and soul of the orginal recording from the middle of the 20th Century. That is all, buy original, keep away from this crap."
4,LA Catrina,"I am reading this book in Spanish 2 Honors. I would recommend it for Honors students in Spanish 2. Not that I don't believe the regular class would understand it, it can just be a bit confusing at times. This story is about Jamie Gonzalez, a senior at Northgate High School in Los Angeles who travels to Queretaro, Mexico to learn more about her grandmother, dona Josefa de Gonzalez. She learns that her grandmother was a beautiful and rich woman long ago, and was known as ""La Catrina"". Read the book and find out who she was and what happened to her. It's a good book for Spanish students, and the movie accompanies it well."
5,Yahtzee,"This is great. I am a huge fan of Yahtzee and this is even better than the old game, you don't have to keep score, it does it for you"
5,Ultimate Yahtzee,"We received this game quickly and it certainly looked like a new product. In order to instal the game in our new computer using Windows 7, it was necessary to follow the enclosed instructions which involved the use of a setup disc. After using the setup disc, Imissed a plainly stated instruction and had to e-mail Derek at Ostrich for additional help. After Derek pointed out what I had missed in the required steps, it was only a short time until my Wife and I were able to enjoy playing Yahtzee. Thank you DEREK"
4,Ultimate Yahtzee,Ultimate Yahtzee is very entertaining. It can hold my attention for a long time everyday. You can play five different yahtzee games on this one game.Colored yahtzee and triple yahtzee are my favorite. Insted of trying to compete with your oponent you go for high scores.It is fun for most ages.I have had this game before. I was shocked it has gone up ten dollars more than six years ago. I recommend this game for anyone that likes to play games. It helps you to think and use your brain.
2,not what i expected,got the game.. no instructions.. knew how to play classic and painted but the other 3 I didnt have a clue. wouldnt go full screen on computer. other wise its ok...
4,ZAPPA ZAPPA ZAPPA ZAPPA,Not for the weak hearted ZAPPA fans .. hard cores only ... very good ..old stuff..LOVED IT ! there has never been a bad ZAPPA album ..
2,Artifact,"Musically, ""Cucamonga"" has little to offer other than a few interesting tidbits (the swerving vamp through ""Jessie Lee"", for example). The liner notes provide good historical documentation, and the picture of young Frank w/ Steve Allen inside the back cover is a classic! While the music is nothing groundbreaking, and only very occasionally Zappesque, this will be of interest to anyone interested in Frank's earliest work. I spin this occasionally just for fun and to remind myself that even the greatest minds must start somewhere . . ."
1,Ex-band member exploits relationship with basement tapes.,"This collection of material, often only tenuously Zappoid, is so early as to be too early, if you get my drift; it you know what you am, and not what you is."
1,ZAPPA Must be turning in his grave1,"Thisis an effort by Del-Fi to cash in on some old demo tapes they found,Frank wouldn't subject his fans to this [stuff]!"
2,"partially uncommitted, self involved thinking","I must agree with the reader who says there is more style than substance in this book. This applies particularly to S. Felman's part of the book. D. Laub's articles are straightforward and clear, Felman's essays, however, are intellectually self involved, and convey a nervous kind of circular argumentation. This comes across as a very neurotic writing. But may be it's a sign of the times that trauma becomes a pretext for the somewhat usual textual interpretations of academic authors. May be it's also to be expected that most writers fail somewhat when they try to talk about personal or collective suffering. It is a difficult subject for sure. Read the book for its failures."
4,Gets the job done,"While it may not be professional quality sound, this digital recorder works well for my purposes - basic everyday recording. I like the amount of space it has and the simplicity in transferring files to the computer. I also like the fact that it consumes very little energy (I have been using the same battery for almost a year). Finally, it has a bunch of quality options that make it better than the most basic recorder. Recommended."
4,average... but still usefull...,"This recording device does the job. not much more, nothing less. it has one major drawback for me though, it claims to be VISTA compliant, unfortunatly it is not."
3,no continuous playback function,"A basic recorder, according to the manual there is no continuous playback function so you can't hear all files at once without pressing play often."
1,if you don't want to keep important data..get this,"I bought this digital recorder for school... It recorded OK, but getting and playing back the information was horrible... I had it in my backpack, and since the buttons are in the front, I even had lectures deleted [or who knows where they went? I couldn't find them !!..] I am taking Microbiology from a very fast talking, Head of the Micro Dept, and I needed all information for exams. When re-winding it, it you mistakenly pressed a wrong button,[ ie.. forward or backward, instead of 'stop'] the thing went back to the beginning of the lecture!!!. After swearing a 'blue streak', .I was ready to throw it through the window!!!. I would NEVER recommend this recorder... get it only if you don't care about what you're recording and will never have to listen to it again.!!.."
2,Sad,"It is sad that the high five (5) star ratings on here for the new grey eye glances cd ""A Little Voodoo"" are from their friends that live in their New Jersey, Pa. neighborhood trying to push their cd, etc.This group has fantastic talent but they can't seem to find their niche.First it was acoustic very little drums etc. now I don't know where their heading.Guess it will be a wait , see and listen."
4,Cute,Got this for my two year old for halloween instead of buying the $50 one from the Disney store! And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!! Very cute! And great price!!
3,"Good story, but not what I was looking for","My fourth grade son is interested in Greek mythology and archaeology. I pre-read this book, and I think it may be intended for an older and more feminine reading population.I think there is a market for books that retell and fictionalize the old myths; we found a few good ones when he was interested in Ancient Egypt. This book has Ariadne, Theseus, the minotaur (Asterius), also Daedalus and Icarus -- all interwoven.It's an interesting idea for a story, but it was very heavy on the goddess-worship that Patrice Kindl imagined for the island. We've done a lot of reading about what they have found of Minoan civilization, and with all the emphasis on the Bull in the murals and artifacts found there, it's hard to believe that Knossos was a Queendom, as this story suggests.It's an entertaining book, but it may be a better book for kids who are interested in a good love/heartbreak story, rather than a good historical story."
4,Lost in the Labyrinth- a great read,"Lost in the Labyrinth, by Patrice Kindl, is a great book I would recommend to 6th-8th graders. A little bit advanced and complicated, mixed with puzzles and mysteries, the main character Princess Xenodice discovers her family's deep secrets. This book is based on Greek myth about the Minotaur and Theseus. I would recommend this book to kids who would enjoy reading a historical fiction book of Ancient Greece and discover mysteries that lies beyond the labyrinth."
5,Oxford American Dictionary,The book is great. I bought this one for a five year old because he looks at mine each time he come over to my house. He is fasinated with the pictures. I use my book every day. I do cross word puzzles and the book is a wealth of information. I could not do without it. Dianne evans
4,Really great book.,I bought a copy of this book.Its really good. Lot of picturesThe words have good meanings specially the ones that reuire a picture.
5,Hilarious,"This is a great show! I loved Fat Actress so it took me a minute to get used to the new format, but Kirstie is hilarious regardless. Buy this!"
1,Not as advertised,This item did not come in as advertised. There was no bird house included. Was supposed to be for a Christmas gift.
1,this is not for grade school age children,"I bought this to read to my 9 year old son. The language used in this book was very advanced. I found the difficulty level to be just a notch below the actual plays. I found a book called ""Stories from Shakespeare"" by Geraldine McCaughrean which was much better and my son is enjoying reading ""Shakespeare""."
5,Breakfast Club cd,"I really love this cd, i have been looking for it for a long time, and its one of my very favorites."
2,Entire CD is wonderful!,Every song on here is good. Too bad the group didn't last cause they were pretty cool. It's a good CD to exercise to.
4,Solid item,"The key feature I like about this product (and it's larger big brother) is that the lid closes around the top clasp. this allows you to slide it in and out of a briefcase, backpack or BDU/cargo pocket (for the smaller one) without the clip snagging on things. When closed, it is squared off on all sides.Everyone's strength needs will be different but I carry mine during disaster responses around water (it is not waterproof though obviously) and rubble piles and it has held up fine.Take note of the picture to make sure you are comfortable with how it hold your documents because it is limited in that way. Also, there is not an easy way to attach a clip pen (though the large one if deep enough to accommodate a clip pen).Overall, this is a recommended item."
3,Snapak Review,This is not what I thought it was. It is very thin walled and not very heavy duty. If you are looking for the rugged case a service tech would use while making service calls on the road - this is NOT what you want.
4,floor mat,"Received in a timely manner with no real problems. Somehow, I expected it to include two mats and was surprised when only one arrived. Had to reorder the second mat at a later date and the website temporarily indicated the item was no longer available. A couple weeks later, when I was planning to return the first one, it became available and I now have two matching mats. All is well!"
3,only one mat???,"Honestly, why couldn't they just sell the mats in a set of 2 because it's only obvious that a car needs TWO! Anyway back to the mat. It looks really nice but it's rather thin and the color really stand out in my toyota celica 2000. Overall, the mat is alright but it should cost less especially for just one MAT!"
5,Great everything !,"Amazon is great in its packaging and I got excellent delivery through the two-days shiping and it arrived in time, i.e. early in the second day !Thank you!"
2,Unsatisfactory,The product received was not satisfactory - The multimedia CD was not shipped along with the book.Make sure the CD will be shipped along with the book before placing the order.It is important to have CD to follow the book
4,"These CD's are ON, But....","This is a very good intro collection for anyone that's interested in original Chicago House. If you really want to dig deeper, there is a Jesse Saunders CD out that goes way back to the Warehouse days. There are so many more songs and tracks from this sub-culture. It would really be the BOMB if some DJ, Producer, etc. would find and issue out some old Ron Hardy tracks."
2,Lots of info but not well organized.,"Almost all travel guidebooks I've seen are organized by location; but the writers, editors, of this book decided on lumping everything by subject instead. And that, I agree with the reviewer above, was a big mistake. It can be very time-consuming and irritating to use this book. Say you are going to Cambridge on the Eastern shore: you will have to search for info about architecture, accomodations, restaurants, shops, nearby wildlife refuges, boat tours, golf, etc. etc. all over the book. Unfortunately, there are not many books on the Chesapeake Bay region to choose from. If you do get this book you may also want to get a stack of Post-it Notes to attach to pages and label these about what is to be found there. You may then find yourself with maybe a dozen pages labled ""Cambridge"" and so on ..."
2,Don't buy this book...,"...without knowing that it is written for the seven-string guitar with the lowest string tuned to ""B"" and not the standard ""A,"" a fact that will not otherwise be revealed to you until the book arrives in the mail."
1,i think this guy writes his own reviews.,The reviews just sound like something a sales person would say. He also sells the book himself in marketplace.
4,Excellent Automatic Pool Cleaner,"Wanda the whale is an easy to use, good quality and effective pool cleaner. It cleans my above ground pool in just one hour!"
4,Wonderfully Wise!,"This book is so wise! It teaches an important lesson: Better to be safe that sorry, but you much take chances once in awhile. It is a cute, adorable story. I definitly recommend this book. It is the best in the series, I think."
1,This book gets a ''Mega Punch'',".......and a big stinky thumbs down goes to Pokemon Tales!! I hate this series. I saw this in a bookstore one day and it wasn't what I expected it to be. Instead of a cool Pokemon book it was a chubby baby book. It was SOOOOO boring. Like, who would think someone THAT young would like POKEMON????? Who would think someone that young would even KNOW about Pokemon???????!!!!!!!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!!!,"Maroon 5 has become, by far, my favorite band! Songs About Jane has been in my CD player constantly since August. Every son captures emotion, especially Harder to Breathe, Tangled, Secret, Through With You, Not Coming Home, and Sweetest Goodbye. I recommend this CD to anyone who is tired of the crappy pop music that is littering the airwaves. Adam Levine has such a great voice, and if you ever get the chance to see this band in concert (which I just did!) you will love them twice as much for their fun personality and energy-charged stage performance. And unlike some bands, they sound just as amazing live as they do on CD. I promise you won't regret this purchase! I bought it having only heard Harder to Breathe, and it was the best random purchase I've ever made."
5,INCREDIBLE !!,The music today is getting progressively worse as the only new songs coming out are remixes of old songs!! Rap and hip hop are taking over the culture!! It is refreshing to hear such an original and incredible album!! I highly reccommend this to anyone!!
1,ugh bad,"Maroon 5 are ""possibly the worst band currently recording music"" as Ed the Sock put it and I find Hilary Duff more entaining. The singles are like bad, but the rest of the album is worse. So buy if you like really bad music; I know many of you do, or they wouldn't be popular."
2,Gloria Gaynor? Foreigner?,"I'm suprised that nobody has noticed this, but ""This Love"" is a direct rip of ""I Will Survive"". It's like as if they changed a few words around and kept the same rhymes and structure. Also: it has a blend of Foreigner's Blue Morning Blue Day music. I dont see why everybody gives this band 5 stars. The album is fun and really catchy, but it's mediocre. I give it a thumbs up for its catchiness, but its really unoriginal. I know ""Harder to Breate"" is a rip of something else, but I can't figure it out. This is an album i'd only download on mp3."
2,Horribly Nasal!,"Maroon 5 are just a hopeless band that are trying to create music that 'sounds' like Stevie Wonder's. That is how desperate they are, I mean you can't re-create music as innovative and as unique as that. Also it sounds nothing like it, their 'infusion' of RnB and Rock just doesn't work at all and is disasterous at most. Their one 'average' song would be ""This Love"" and I feel generous giving this album 2 stars and calling that song average."
1,One Hit Wonders?,"I've been listening to Maroon 5's first single ""Harder to Breathe"" a lot lately. On the surface I like it, but there was always something bugging me about the song. It lacks *something* to flesh it out. I thought about it and thought about it and I've decided that they need a different vocalist. Or a lot of backup vocals. I've listened to the rest of the tracks to get a feel for their sound, and it's very college band. They have just enough groove and funk to get airplay on pop stations, but from the vocals to the limp guitars they're largely unoriginal. When ""This Love"" started up I thought I had accidentally downloaded a Britney Spears track. ""She Will Be Loved"" would be a fantastic song if it wasn't for the boring, whiney vocals. The rest of the tracks are slow and unremarkable."
2,Vallejo Thicker Than Water really blows this out of the water,"A few good songs, but it gets stale quickly compared to the debut....one reviewer recomended the new Vallejo Thicker Than Water CD, and I checked it out....smoking, killer CD.....I recomend that highly over this CD"
4,A great album,"I love rock/pop, sinphonic, and progresive rock from the sixties and seventies....bands like the beatles, pink floyd, led zeppelin, genesis, yes, elo, elp, and lot more have influenced me, and i hate almost all bands noww.....there are some bands, like the strokes (which in my opinion is the best rock band of the moment),all the brit pop movement, colplay, blur, oasis, maybe this two new bands Franz ferdinand and Jet, and my new discovery Maroon 5....i bought the album, here in argentina they sell the expanded edition....and i think its great....the mix of rock/pop, with a little bit of funk, and R&B, makes a great combination.....the best songs of the album are Sunday Morning, Must get out (which remembers me of a Paul mcartney composition with the beatles, in the chorus), She will be loved, and this love.....but the hole album is great, and Rag Doll, one of the bonus tracks in this edition, also kicks ass.....im glad they won the grammy for best new artist..."
2,More than slightly overrated,"I've yet to understand Maroon 5's appeal. While the CD has some catchy tracks, the vocals lack a strong delivery and the songwriting is weak. I'm quite sure that Maroon 5 will never have another breakthrough CD- they lack staying power."
3,Fair at best,"To be honest, I bought this CD because I loved the ""Harder to Breathe"" song. It is awesome. And the new offering, ""This Love"" is above average too. But I was extremely disappointed in the rest of the album. None of the other offerings provide the hard edged sound we get in Harder to Breathe and This Love. The rest tend to pine away with wishy-washy lyrics and melodies. If I wanted that sound, I'll listen to John Mayer."
5,WOW.,"words just DO NOT do this album justice. these guys rock. hard. they're an awesome live band. I've seen them 4 times live and loved EVERY minute of it. if you're looking for some good rock music with a touch of jazz and funk, BUY THIS ALBUM.and catch them in concert. you won't be disappointed, =D."
5,AMAZING!,"Okay, okay, I admit it. I'm not amazingly hard to please when it comes to my music collection. As long as it's not rap (i.e. i understand what's being said), and the beat or lyrics are relatively catchy, I'm a happy girl. But when my friend bought me Songs About Jane for my birthday, I was blown away! I instantly fell in love with this band and their funky style. This cd rarely leaves my stereo. I'm especially enamored with ""She will be Loved,"" ""This Love,"" ""Must Get Out,"" ""Tangled,"" and ""Shiver."" This is a must buy for anyone who's a fan of Matchbox 20, Jason Mraz, or John Mayer. I really highly recommend checking out Maroon 5 , and some of their old records when they were known as Kara's Flowers."
2,Nothing special,"I picked up this CD because I'd heard a sample and found it mildly promising. And it was pretty cheap too. But as I listened to the disc, all the songs started to run together. In fact, most of the album consists of bland filler songs that all sound the same. There are a couple tracks that stand out from the rest, but that's not really saying much. And too many of the songs remind me strongly of N'Sync with guitars thrown in. Not to mention the lead singer's voice sounds whiny after awhile. I'm can't say that I'm impressed with Maroon 5."
4,Grows on you,"Of course, everyone loves She Will Be Loved. I've heard it ad nauseam on the radio and couldn't help but like it. I still wasn't intent upon purchasing this CD. Then, everyone from vastly diverse backgrounds began to rave and rave about how they couldn't take this CD out of their car CD player and how incredibly unique this funky, alternative, poppy, yet soulful band really is. So, I figured what the hey.At first, the CD I thought was immensely overrated. Upon hearing it the 3rd time and truly listening to the lyrics and getting into the funky, yet hook-laden progressions, I began to see the light. Now, I can't take it out of my CD player. Good stuff."
5,Fantastic CD!,"This is one of the best CD's out there today. I loved many of the songs on the album. What is great is I loved most of the songs, while on most other CD's I'll just like 1 or 2 songs. I personally loved ""Harder to Breathe,"" ""This Love,"" ""Sunday Morning,"" and others. ""Sunday Morning"" has a jazzy tune to it, while ""Harder to Breathe"" is more rock, and ""This Love"" has Pop to it. Many of their songs hit different Genras! What's also great is you can dance to the beat of many of their songs too! I recommend everyone buy this Album!"
4,"VERY, VERY SATISFYING","I bought this title because I listened to one of their songs, 'Harder to Breathe', at Circut City. I knew right off that this was the band for me. I hafta tell you, it was better than I expected. If I could, I would have rated this CD a 4 stars and a half, but four will settle for now. I encourage fans of Linkin Park and Green Day to buy this title, because I am a fan of them all and enjoy them almost equally. Do not listen to people saying this is trash, because I think, it is a great work of art. I never really was a soft or hard rock fan before I bought their album. Listen to me; this was a GREAT Cd, and was worth every penny of my money."
4,"Pretty good album, too bad for radio overplay","I think ""Songs About Jane"" is a good album, the only thing that really sucks is how radio overplayed this thing... that is why I can't listen to songs like ""Harder to Breath"" or ""She Will Be Loved"" without slightly getting annoyed. Regardless, I think the music on this album is great. It is R & B and funk with a rock twist. My favorite cut on this album is ""Sunday Morning"", I think that is a beautiful song that can put a smile on your face. Maybe once this thing stops playing on radio 24/7 it will be easier to listen to..."
5,Songs About Jane Should Be Songs About Everyone !!,"This is 1 of the BEST rock/pop/soul infused CD's out to date. Their songs have reached a TON of people and that is what counts. I hope that they aren't going to be a one hit album wonder like some bands that have come out in the past 10 years. The best songs on the CD are ""Tangled"", ""Must Get Out"", and ""This Love"". Although these are the best songs on the CD, I would higly recommend listening to the entire CD b/c I know once you do, it will become a favorite for you."
5,Modern day Funk/Rock/Pop all rolled into one........,"I knew when I saw ""This Love"" earlier this year in January on VH1 this group was going to be big.I love this CD.They have a very excellent mixture of funk and rock.Kinda on the verge of a modern Hall and Oates if you will.I will say my other fav songs are ""Sunday Morning"" very Stevie Wonder influenced.I also enjoy ""Not Coming Home"" and ""The Sun"".Nope these guys are not an all boy band that would be silly to say as they are great musicians and since they are up for a Grammy I would say the rest speaks for itself,they are a real rejuvenated sound that I'm sure to enjoy hopefully for a very long time."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"I think that your going to either love or hate Maroon5. If you like their singles I suggest you ask a friend to borrow the cd and see for yourself if it's worth buying. I don't think they are trying to be a boyband, however, Adam Levine's voice is scarely similair to Justin Timberlake's in a few songs. The music on this cd are not NEW as some people keep suggesting, they are just mixed with older music.The differences between the singles are not like that on the cd. There are about 4 songs that sound the same, but with a few chords changed - luckily they are good songs. If you like bluesy music with a little bit of classic rock then you will probably enjoy. If your just looking for something fresh, check out Maroon5. The CD is decent and Adam is very good vocalist."
5,amazing soulful rock!!,"I first heard Maroon 5 last winter when they opened for Nikka Costa in St. Louis. My friends and I could not believe how amazing their sound was! Adam Levine, the lead singer, has a voice so full of soul and emotion that allows him to take any song he performs to a whole new level. The music is rich and full of soul and energy, the lyrics are personal and gripping and the band members are totally relatable. These guys are my new favorite boy band and their album is a complete hit! Look out for them soon because they are going to blow everyone away!"
1,Jane Must Be Mighty Embarassed....,"It has been loudly insisted for so long that this band is brilliant, to the point where many have started to believe it. ""Songs About Jane"" will be coveted among former boy-band-lovin teens and obssesive Maroon 5 fans. But, musically speaking, it's a terrible album. With the acception of the somewhat catchy ""This Love"", the entire album is a listless collection of tepid ballads. ""Harder To Breathe"" seems to have wandered off of the last N'SYNC album, and ""She Will Be Loved"" has more crooning than an entire Alanis Morisette album- except Alanis does it better. ""Tangled"" is a funky little song with a good beat completely ruined by Adam Levine's rough voice. ""Must Get Out"" would be good if someone else sang it. ""Through With You"" is the worst song of the album. Ouch."
5,Truly Amazing!,"I LOVE MAROON 5! I think they are truly amazing. Adam Lavigne has SOOO much talent! ""Sunday Morning"" is my favorite song off of the album, but the other songs are amazing too! I would give it 1,000,000,000 stars, but 5 is the best!"
2,Two Good Songs,"I Admit, I much as i dont like this band, ""Songs About Jane"" does have two Good tracks...too bad there right next to each other and the ten after them suck a fat one."
5,HELP!!!! can't stop listening to this cd!!!,The BEST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT> STOP READING THIS AND GO BUY IT. NOW. GO. SERIOUSLY. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.My fave songs:Must Get OutSunday Morning
1,Not happy,"I ordered this c.d Dec 7th and it is now Jan 9th and I still have not received it. It was supposed to be a Christmas present. I have not heard anything back from the company I ordered it from, I would like my money back!"
1,Uhhh,"Maroon 5 is just a guy band singing about their ex-girlfriends. The lead singer sounds like an a** also. I saw him in Rolling Stone and was reading about him, I was shocked hes such a a** and perveted. Hes not even really taleneted I saw them on MTV once cause I was living with this family for a while and her son's watch MTV alot and were watching Maroon 5, I thought to myself no talent at all. Bands shouldnt be about pretty boys singing about their ex-girlfriends, or make a video about going out with a girls mom. I am sorry but Maroon 5 is garbage to my ears."
1,Songs about God,"My woman the other night and I were talking about God. I was talking about all the bad things in the world. She said ""your God is quite mean"". She then asked why I thought God was so mean. I said it was because he let a bunch of buttplugs like this become rich and famous.She understood me after that.Thanks"
1,Simply terrible,"This album made me want to fall asleep. Not in a good, mellow way. Very boring and uninspired, with the exception of ""Harder to Breathe."" Maybe my lack of music eltism impairs my judgement on this CD, but, seriously, this album is not worth anyone's time."
1,not even worth 1 star,"Anyone who has compared this sh#@*y band to Stevie Wonder needs to stop smoking the crack. Stevie Wonder has more talent in his little finger than this whole band. If you listen to some classic Stevie and still insist on making comparisons, then I feel for you. You obviously lack taste. To say that they suck is unfair to the word suck. I'll bet that, unless they have another hit single from this atrocity of an album, we have heard the last of Maroon 5. The high school kids who listen to them will graduate, pass them by and they'll be TSOL. I hope they get while the gettin's good because pretty soon there won't be anything left for them to get. Goodbye and good riddance Maroon 5. You suck worse than any band that has ever sucked before."
1,Moron 5,"Okay first of all the CD is called ""Songs about Jane"" So what do you think all the songs are going to be about? JANE! That's it. It's all about Jane. They could have atleast done a good job of it, like Hawthorne Hieghts did with ""The silence in black and white"". They made songs about one girl good. But Maroon5 is the opposite. Why in the world am I comparing Maroon 5 to Hawthorne Heights? They are totally different in every way!In the section ""People who bought this title also bought..."" They have listed Kelly Clarkson. And I have to say Kelly Clarkson is more of a rock band than Maroon5 will ever be."
3,Maroon 5,"I am a real record producer. My review of this:Am I crazy or has this been done before and better by Jamiraquoi?Maroon 5 are decent musicians, but its a total cop of Jamiraquoi!Do yourself a favor, If you like this funk pop rock stuff, buy the Jamiraquoi records, they are better!"
2,"Just more bland, MTV pop...","I liked Maroon 5 when I heard ""Harder to Breathe."" ""This Love"" was good, just severly overplayed. ""She Will be Loved"" is absolutely awful. It's just more of the same boring, bland, pop ""rock"" with three or four ok to good songs with the rest as simple, bubble-gum slow pop crap. I've only listened to half of the CD's songs (the rest on the Amazon 30-second samplers), and it's bad. Trust me. It doesn't quite deserve 1-star, because some of the songs aren't terrible.But only some.Avoid."
1,Just plain bad.,"If I were to describe Maroon 5's sound, it would be a poppy blend of rock,funk, and jazz. To be honest, I bought this CD because I really liked track 1,""Harder to Breathe"". Had I known that NONE OF THE OTHER SONGS WOULD SOUND REMOTELY CLOSE TO THIS ONE, I would have skipped the purchase. Granted - the lead singer's voice is a pleasure to listen to. The fact is that the rest of the songs are just plain Boring. Good tracks: 1,2, and 4.My main point is just that there is better stuff out there than this. The album is mediocre, and some songs seemed forced and drawn out. Stay away from this..."
1,"They were killed on the radio, I can't stand them now","I thought ""This Love"" was awesome when it first came out, but I have been hearing multiple Maroon 5 songs on the radio every...single....day......for the past several weeks. There are a few good songs on this album, but it does NOT deserve the colossal amount of airplay it has been getting. If I hear ""She Will Be Loved"" one more f^&*ing time, I'm going to vomit. They had potential, but fell victim to relentless radio overplay. I'm SO excruciatingly sick of these guys I can't even put it into words. I PRAY that radio will put them to rest for at least a little while. LET US BREATHE!!! GIVE SOME OTHER ARTISTS A CHANCE!!!! For Christ's sake.....there hasn't been a band this overplayed since No Doubt....at least No Doubt's songs were really good......."
1,Don't Wate YOur Time With this Band,"One of the best live bands to come around in a long time? You have GOT to be kidding me. I saw them live opening for Jason Mraz. Mraz was great, but watching Maroon 5 really put a damper on the whole evening. The lead singer tried to act all cool and everything, but came off as being REALLY annoying. Their live show is really nothing special and altogether boring. As for the album, come on people. This is major music industry at its finest, producing mindless sludge that has been used over and over again and then labeling them as being totally ""unique"". So what makes this band so ""unique""? Believe me, if you really want to listen to this band, you're better off downloading the songs than buying the album. Trust me, it's not worth the price tag."
1,Ugh.,"I was unpleasantly surprised the the average rating for this CD was so high. Let me be blunt-this music is just disgusting. ""She Will Be Loved,"" is just annoying, I'm ashamed that these guys are even associated with the rock genre. I guess this is what people listen to today-which is really pretty sad. If you like pop and all of that, you'll probably enjoy this album. On the other hand, if you like good music, the kind that doesn't make you want to throw yourself in front of a moving train, stay away from this one."
3,Sounds just like Justin Timberlake,"Some of the songs were good, but half of them sounded exactly like Justin Timberlake, being that i am not his biggest fan, i was a little disapointed. Don't get me wrong, not all of the sounds sound like him, but the half that do sound exactly the same."
2,1 star for each good song,"Once you get beyond the two single hits, this album is a mediocre collection of forgettable songs. I've listened to the CD three times and have found no improvement with time. Don't waste your money, download the singles and forget the rest."
2,What is this?,"I go look at the CD here on amazon.com and the reviews are awsome, but I get the CD and I am really dissapointed. I really enjoy new music and I thought I was in for a treat, but I was dissapointed. They had good beats, but each song is sung in the same way as the first. I just gets kind of old. But, hey, whatever your into."
1,The Depressing Depths,"Another band that prooves 'hype over content' is the poisoness cocktail slowly ruining contemporary guitar music. I've tried to come up with a suitable logline - I hope you like it - Buy Maroon 5's Album - or soak yourself in tepid bath water. Not particularly unpleasant, but you wont try it again.Dreadful Dreadful dreadful. On behalf of Maroon 5, I appolgise to the real song writers."
3,radio friendly pop/rock,"this album was crafted to fit with the radio and billboard charts but there are some exceptionally good pop numbers with funk and r&b influences on this CD. If you can ignore their lame videos and appreciate the music itself, then we have a winner."
2,10 songs short of being a great cd,"After listening to the first two songs on this cd, I had high hopes that this might be the first complete Cd that I had listened to in a long time. Apparently this should have been an EP if they still make those. Harder to Breath is certainly a catchy song but unfortunately the disk peaks on the first track. After that, you are left wanting. This is a frustrating CD. After the first track you want the entensity to continue but it quickly fades away to some very forgettable tunes."
3,alright but not great,"the songs are totally pop but this album is nothing more than a period piece. Some of the songs are radio friendly that you'll enjoy for a bit, but after hearing it a gazillion times, it will become the kind of pop music that will be forgotten when the next pop craze comes along with their pop/r&b/rock fusion sound. Adam's voice is alright though not the best, and they're not really musicians to be taken seriously, and don't really know a thing about making good music videos. But if you listen to Kanye West's Late Registration Adam Levine makes a guest appearance on the track Heard Em Say on which he sounds a lot better than on this album and there is an amazing piano hook in it too. Definitely check that out if you can."
4,What Fun!!!,"This album does exactly what it sets out to do, make us have a great time while listening. With a very innovative sound, and a exceedingly charismatic lead vocalist, Maroon 5 is just a purely enjoyable band. The irresistabe ""This Love"", and catchy ""Harder To Breathe"" make this one killer record. Other worthy tracks like ""Tangled"", ""Secret"", ""Sweetest Goodbye"", and ""She Will Be Loved"" vastly increase the albums likeability . The best cut in my opinion is the charming ""Sunday Morning"", which has an alluringly sweet sound that you would love to play on a...well Sunday Morning. This is a fun record to add to your collection, and I highly recommend it."
5,My Maroon 5 Review,Maroon 5's CD is addicting. I love the sounds and the beat all the songs are good. My favorite is Harder To Breath. If you think This Love is good then this Cd is right for you. I happen to think that if you don't like smooth music then you won't like this I just brought it yesterday and I love it! It's interesting and is full of wonderful songs. Good music for a rainy day!!
4,A magical ride on the soulful rock train!,"This is better than Green Day's Dookie, Incubus' first 3 CDs (the putrid Fungus Amongus, overrated to the High Heavens S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and the sporadically magical Make Yourself). It's also a tad better than Make Yourself by the same band.This is the Maroon 5 that I miss. True that it's still really early to hear their signature sound, seeing as they've just released a second disc in May 2007, but I still can't help but wonder what pressure caused them to ""suit up"" (literally) and take themselves WAY too seriously?!?!?!It confuses, angers and saddens me, all in one try!I miss songs such as Harder To Breath, She Will Be Loved, Tangled, The Sun, Through With You and my favorite, the sexy and sultry, Secret.I have this import version, which I purchased from Wal-Mart earlier this year and it has mixes of This Love. None of the extra songs are good, save for Rag Doll, which is full of bluesy emotion.4.25 stars for the band that ONCE could..."
3,"About ""Secret"".....","""Secret"" has such a sexy, dreamy quality -- had a lot of potential -- but the lyrics destroyed the potential the song had to transcend the shallow, rather childish ""oh you're so hot"" syndrome that is infecting so much of today's music. Subtlety, folks -- please -- let's have some subtlety."
5,Amazing album,This is a really good album. The songs are simply fantastic and easy to be listened. Good work by these guys. Hopefully their commitment in the concerts is as good as their CDs.
5,A refreshingly funky and sexy album!,"What can I say about ""Songs about Jane""?This album constantly surprises me by how much I can listen to it. Every song has a unique and appealing feel to it. Adam Levine has an amazingly sexy voice that sounds like a smooth drink going down. My favourite songs on this album are: Sunday Morning, The Sun, Secret, Sweetest Goodbye and Not coming Home. There are also the radio favourites: She will be Loved, Harder to breathe and This Love. Maroon 5 manages to cover a variety of genres in this ablum: R'n'B, Funk, Blues and Pop, therefore feeding most tastes in one album. I would recommend this album to anyone I know and have given it as a gift many times."
4,A New Sound,"Maroon 5 has brought introduced a new sound in music by fusing R&B;, jazz and rock into their own brand of music. Indeed, I personally feel that Maroon 5 has given us music listeners something new; just like how Norah Jones in 2002/03 stormed with Come Away With Me. The main reason that Maroon 5 is doing so well is to do with its unique music, which no one else offers at the moment.Adam, the lead singer of Maroon 5, has a very good voice and best of all, he uses it well on this CD. You won't find the usual hoarse voices of Nickelback or 3 Doors Down or Lifehouse. I find similarities between Adam's vocals and that of Justin Timberlake - perhaps even better.I am a great fan of music and listen to almost anything. But I only purchase CDs that are worth keeping and listening to over and over again. This CD is that type of CD. One more thing - Maroon 5: expect Grammys next year.Update 2005: What did I tell ya? Hail this year's Best New Artist at the Grammys."
5,A True Variety... and Great Music too!,"I first heard the single ""This Love"" on MTV. However it was not until I fell in love with ""She Will be Loved"" when I knew I had to check this band out. This album is truly unique. I like all types of music from Oldies to Backstreet Boys to Linkin Park to Lil Jon and the East Side Boys, along with classical music and jazz. Songs about Jane is an album that combines many gneres, but ties them together with their own style. R&B roots lie in jazz and blues, as do funk roots. I don't really care for the whole ocncept of genres, but if I had to categorize this I'd say its Jazz, R&B, and funk infused rock, or Jazz, R&B, and funk infused pop-rock, if you will. It's lamost like a less flamboyant Prince meets rock, but definatley not hard rock. Listening to the samples of the song on Amazon.com, I knew I wanted this CD and it was wort every penny."
4,Shocked.,"This CD is great. I had no clue who this group was until i heard ""This Love"" on the radio, & i had to have it. Once i listened, i realized i had heard ""Harder to Breathe"" before too. This group is completely original, combining r&b with alternative rock in a new way. it's hard to describe exactly what this group sounds like, but the CD is great.Highlights: Shiver (best song on the CD), Harder to Breathe, Tangled, This Love.I'd give it 5 stars, but a lot of the songs are really short. Like, less than 3 minutes - 4 minutes. And there are only 12 songs. & if you like this group, you'd love Jamiroquai."
2,Not That Great,"Their single ""Harder to Breathe"" is a great song and I love it so I thought I would like some of their other songs, but I was disappointed. Some of the other songs seem way too pop for me and seem totally different from ""Harder to Breathe."" I wasn't impressed."
2,"Rock and Roll, what?","I heard the song ""Harder to Breathe"" many time on the radio and TV, and liking the song I decided to go out and buy the cd. From that song, I believed that Maroon 5's sound was part old rock and roll, mixed in with some new pop sound. Boy was I wrong, the rest of the songs on the cd are much softer than ""Harder to Breathe,"" in fact they sound nothing like it. The cd has a very distinctive pop sound, with little to none of the rock sound I was looking for. While I have nothing against softer rock, the songs just did not seem to be of the same quality as ""Harder to Breathe:"" they just were not good. I was very disappointed. I listen to ""Harder to Breathe"" and then jump to the next disc in the changer."
4,Pop is not dead,"Okay, not everyone will agree with me when I call this 'pop', but personally I think Maroon 5 is just about the best pop music around at the moment.As for the extra tracks on this 'Asian' version... 3 out of the 4 aren't special. The acoustic versions of ""Harder to Breathe"" and ""She Will be Loved"" appear to be lifted straight from the acoustic 1.22.03 EP (that's the recording date given for both). They're pleasant enough but not a match for the studio versions. The Kanye West remix of ""This Love"" strikes me as pretty average, but I'm not a fan of remixes generally and may be biased.The REAL bonus here is ""Rag Doll"", a bluesy song over 5 minutes long that is every bit as good as the main album. If you're thinking of buying the album anyway, this track is the reason to give serious consideration to getting the 16-track version."
5,Surprisingly Addictive,"When the CD first came out, I hadn't even registered the band at all. I had heard ""Harder to Breathe"" on the radio a couple of times, and while I thought it was a good song, I didn't give it or the band any serious consideration. But when I was given ""Songs About Jane"" for my birthday, I sat down and listened to it from beginning to end.And I am glad I did. Maroon 5 is an addition to the bands that have recently come out, with catchy, well-written songs and expressive vocals. ""This Love"" is unbelievably addictive, and ""She Will Be Loved"" is sweet and tinged with a little sadness. There really isn't a low point in the whole CD, and there isn't a track I find myself skipping at any time.I fully recommend this to anyone who wants to hear good music. :)"
3,"Nice, easy listening.","Defiantly not extraordinary, but a little out of the ordinary nonetheless.Its easy to listen to, and enjoyable. Definatly worth a few spins.If you can find it cheap (just buy a used one from here), then its a good buy,"
1,Let me make it simple,"I don't have MTV and I don't listen to pop radio. They won a grammy or something, so I downloaded the album. It was the first time I ever heard Maroon 5. Here is a completely unbiased review without being pretentious in the least:My first impression was, that this sounds like N*SYNC with real instruments. I'm not exaggerating for effect.A bit of Third Eye Blind thrown in for good measure. This is total boy band stuff.If you like N*SYNC you will like this. If you like Third Eye Blind, or Matchbox 20, you might like this, but will be annoyed by the N*SYNC/BSB vocals and lyrics."
2,Now what?,"Jeez people are still listening to this? How is this rock? It's bubblegum pop. I got the cd in April last year! I listened to it for about a month then got sick of it when I realised they weren't really very good. The music itself is unoriginal, the subject matter is all the same and now most peole have lost intrest (even the MTV teenyboppers). They can't really play their instruments in harmony with each other, the guitar is almost unheard, the drums are boring and slow (I've been playing since February and I can already play their songs) and the music doesn't compliment the lyrics or the other instruments. But it has 2 stars cos they sucked me in for a while. But now, they have no real place to go cos no self-respecting woman would date the lead singer so he can't write songs, and their sound is tired. If you want rock with a funk element, go for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. These guys have real staying power."
2,I give it two for potential,"This group dissappointed me. They were ALMOST good, you can just feel it, but they fall short of the mark. Whenever I hear this mediocre group's lead singer pandering on and on over the radio airwaves, I am reminded of the J. Geils Band, except less clever."
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this cd because I thought the group had an interesting sound. It's a good cd but it has it's faults. Some of the songs are great, but I must admit that a lot of them sound really similar to each other. There were a couple of time when I first heard the cd that I thought it was repeating a song I had already listened to. Overall though the cd is above average. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could."
5,only one word to xplain this album = AMAZING,"For a debut album ""Songs about Jane"" really surprised me...!! the group has amazin lyrics and beats... my best songs and the ones i'd recommend to hear first are ""This love"" ""Not Coming Home"" & ""Shiver""... the album is aproximately 45 minutes of amazing beats and lyrics... i'd recommend this to any person who likes 3 doors down's style .... hope the next album would be better"
5,They Just Recruited A New Fan..,"I received this CD from a friend of mine who I can always count on to find rare gems. I was so surprised that me, a r&b, hip-hop, sometimes pop listener would be feeling a band like this. Their album is fantastic. Wonderful mix of rock, pop, and a touch of funk. This is the only CD that I have had in a while that I can play all the way through without skipping tracks. Each track is worthy of being a single all it own. My favorites keep changing. It was at first 'This Love' because of its jumping, infectious beat, but 'Tangled' has got me whipped. From the hard-core in-your-face 'Harder to Breath' to the romantic 'Will be loved'. Definitely a band that is on the rise to super stardom. Wouldn't be surprised to find their music on motion picture soundtracks all over the place because of the scene-setting mood that each song posesses. I already heard one of their tracks on the TV show 'ER' and am waiting for more. I have to say, I am now a fan and you will be too."
2,*Yawn*,Wake me when it's over. The most boring compliation of all their work. I expected better. Another come and go group??
2,"Enjoyable for about two listens, and incredibly unoriginal.","Combine bad pop-rock with some funk riffs, and wow! You have Maroon 5. And yes, I have heard this record in total. After ""She Will Be Loved"" (which, by the way, is boyband revival in its worst form), the record loses all sense of eclecticism (about 3 of the songs use the same riffs, just with a minor chord change or two), until you get to ""Sunday Morning"", which rips off Incubus' ""Summer Romance"" so badly it makes me sick. Save for a Radiohead-ish ""Through With You"", it's just not worth it. Please, go buy Pavement's ""Crooked Rain Crooked Rain"" if you like alt. rock, and go buy anything by Galactic if you like the funk aspect of it."
2,"1 great single, 1 competent song, and the rest filler","I couldn't agree more with the reviewers who note this band has:1. One killer song, ""Harder to Breathe""2. One OK one, ""This Love""3. An album whose remainder is 50% NSYNC, 50% JamiroquoiTruly awful, but it gets more than one star for ""Harder to Breathe.""The Third Eye Blind of the mid-aughts. Bonus making-fun-of-them points for the stupid lead singer comparing the band to Missy Elliot! ZOINKS! Check the Boston Globe's archives if you don't believe me."
1,The bottom of the barrel of the pop genre.,I am concerned that this band is successful. They should have never been signed. Low-quality pap for the radio.
3,"I wouldn't pay to see them in concert, but...","I did find myself singing along to them a few times in the car... however, they certainly aren't my favorite. If you want something that's easy to listen to but musically a bit more impressive try John Mayer... or, even better, listen to REAL Motown interspersed with some better rock."
4,This Love!!!,"The beat and rhythm of this songs sounds familar with another song, but I can't quite figure out what it is. Anybody know what i'm talking about?"
1,Terrible,"Terrible. How can a band with so little talent and a singer with such a poor, poor voice become so popular? It's always stunning when you realize how dumb some music ""fans"" are. This band is awful."
1,do they think they're jackson 5 or something?,"hence maroon 5, first single sounding like I want you back with an ugly sexual video. Shows you how serious musicians they are....."
3,one good run of the mill,"If their video is anything to go by (their audio is not), the bunch use old-style analog keys - moog or pipe-organ even. This gives them depth. They write... er, passable little songs with britpop as obvious target. Same way that The Monkeys once did with Beatle tunes. However, one has to admit the band is up against heavy competiotion in The Datsuns, The Plimsouls, to say nothing about Oasis. Many-many garage bands (in your own vicinity!) outplay and outwrite (and out-everything!) this one, from the word go. After heavy MTV and virtually all FM stations' rotation exposure experience - you will be hard pressed to confirm you enjoy the album's hit-single number. It's a seat-smeared gum stuck on your trousers unreachably - you dismiss it by way of acceptance. Are you not?"
3,BORING!,"The first two songs are great, but as the music progresses, it turns into plain crap.Get it if you want to get board."
1,I already consider them a flash in the pan,"their first single was the only good song and gets a lot of heavy rotation still, but the video ruined it for me, and where I'm at, the rest of the singles do not get much airplay, and I doubt that they'll be talked about next year. If you like this kind of music, you may find better music in bands like Hall & Oates, Simply Red, Savage Garden and Tears For Fears."
1,MORONS ALL!,"MORON 5, JUST SAY IT YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO. Anyway back to this trivial band. This album is nothing more than filler music. There is just no other way to describe them, they have no musical talent. Everything they play is incredibly easy and monotonous. Which leads one to come to the same conclusion everytime these guys or the hords of others just like them come out with a new record. COMMERCIAL RADIO SUPREME!!!!!!! These guys are a radio execs wet dream. Now that I think about it I probably shouldn't have used the phrase ""no talent"" Because in all honesty I don't know if they do or not. Mainly because all they ever do is record stuff like this. I guess what I should have said is the stuff that they put out doesn't require any talent. Maybe that won't p*ss off everybody as much. HAHA"
2,Bland as they wanna be,"Wow, another bunch of soulless corporate rock ho's to rock your world . . . Do yourselves a favour, pick up some Stevie Wonder before you let this tripe anywhere near your cd player - Talking Book, Fulfilligness' Last Finale, Innervisions . . .There is no way that you could experience classics like these, and allow your ears to be polluted by these horrifically bland, empty-headed would-be funksters. They are an abomination in the eyes of all humanity."
2,overrated,"I give them 2 stars for this love and one for playing their own instruments. But I'm part of the old school generation(in my late 20's) and prefer groups like Simply Red, Hall & Oates and Genesis over Maroon 5."
2,overrated but some songs are alright,"Through With You is one of the better songs on the album, but I think michael jackson would have sang it wayyy better"
2,This Sludge Is Taking Its Toll On Me...,"Ignoring them whilst i could after the catchy-as-hell Harder To Breath almost 3 years ago, they've somehow menaced their way onto the charts and remained, selling their faceless wan, blanched white r&b to the sad little chubby girls everywhere. Faux funk; upbeat yet colorless; tuneless, scary frontman. Robert Plamer he's not [and, rest his soul, Robert Plamer wasn't much in later years], but thank the gods they're not Jamiroquai. Adam Levine - as unlikely and unsexy as ever a rock star there was - spent too many a teenage sleepless night, enveloped within his headphones, journeying the secret life of plants, in search of Stevie...apparently never finding him. My grade: C+"
1,Moron 5,"I don't know why anyone could like this crap. It's terrible! Adam Levine's voice sounds like he chugged a whole pitcher of canola oil, and yet, the songs are too slow, and boring. This love Has Taken It's Toll On ME? More like ""This BAND has taken it's toll on me!""You want good music? listen to Coheed And Cambria and System Of A Down."
1,one hit wonders,"when I first heard this love I liked it a lot then I saw the video and I was traumatized by what horrible performers they are and how they tried to save their weak musical skills by screwing girls, some of you fans probably wish that was you being screwed, but they most likely want your mother more. Stay away from these music frauds"
5,so in love with their music,"i heard maroon 5 from my friend, the first song i heard was ""not coming home"", and honestly, i danced to it, and it really meant something: it really made my senses crazy!i went straight to the nearest music store to purchase my own copy. listening to it for the first time made me more crazy (no exageraration!) their music tingles my spine whenever i hear the cd i bought during the christmas holidays... a few bucks won't mind coz their music is priceless, a sure hit, and definitely a classic! their music speaks of human emotions, more of angst and joys of being a teen, or being someone young at heart...definitely a feel-good cd with tons of feel-good music!"
5,Will cheer you up!,"While serving in Operation Enduring Freedom it was important to get my mind off the daily stresses and relax. This album is infectious and worked everytime! You find yourself saying ""I'll listen to it just one more time"", over and over.... This is pure talent and the groove is unbelievable. The beat is great!!"
5,Outstanding CD,"If you're looking for something a little different and you like deep and funky bass guitars and hooky lyrics delivered with a Dave-Matthew's Band-like panache, this is definitely worth a listen.I haven't replayed a CD this many times for years. It is fresh and edgy without being over the top. If this CD were a drink, it would be the best Bloody Mary you've ever tasted, with some spice in it that you couldn't quite place. ""Hit me again with that. That was great...""Another CD you might listen to if you like the deep funky bass licks is Keziah Jones. His lyrics tend to be indecipherable though."
4,good cd,"nice music!!!!!I gave it 4 stars b/c most of the songs are good but not all,best songs are:harder to breathe(1st single)this love(2nd single)she will be loved(3rd single)sunday morning(4th single)You should get this cd"
3,Two of the singles are good,I have a thing for some kinds of funk and this deliveredfor the first few songs... But it felt repetitive andit just doesn't reply value... Meaning I just can't listento it over and over again. The CD really isn't worth themoney. Check out a old punk rock band Mothers Finest andyou will get some real music.
4,IF YOU LIKE WIDE MOUTH MASON,"Hey! If you like the canadian band ""Wide Mouth Mason"" you should like Maroon 5. When I first heard them I really thought they WERE Wide Mouth Mason! =o) Their styles really compliment eachother as far as the ""funkyness"" that they throw into their songs. If you enjoyed this CD check out Wide Mouth Mason.~*~Bethany"
1,Five for Fighting meets Dave Matthews,"If John Ondrasik and Dave Matthews had a love child together, it would sound like the lead singer of Maroon5.Ewwww."
2,Backstreet boys on guitar,"They're catchy, they're mildy entertaining. While Maroon 5 puts out a decent album, it's basically some poppy hits and very little substance. At times they go as far as to sound like backstreet boys on guitar. While the make an attempt at a new fusion sound, they become predictable and there songs seem to all sound similar. Referring to them as hard rock is ridiculous, referring to them as alternative pop seems right on. It's not great stuff, it gets boring and tired, and those music purists like me may not make it through the first listen."
1,4 week MTV rotation.. then youll never hear em again,is this dude trying to rip off everyone? how can this cd get anything more than 1 star? its crap. havent you guys notice since 1993 anything on MTV is crap? MTV why are you doing this to us?
1,WARNING TO LISTENERS: DO NOT BUY,"I have listened to one or two of the songs after hearing about how great this band is and everything else about them. In truth, I do not believe I have ever heard worse music, probably in my entire life. The beat, lyrics, the rhythm, the lead singer's voice... If you were driving in a car and heard this song on the radio, you would be best advised to turn to a different station. If you can't do that, turn to your left and drive straight off the bridge. I can honestly say I would rather be deaf than listen to this music. It is this bad. DO NOT BUY THIS CD! IF YOU ACCIDENTLY RECIEVE A COPY, DISPOSE OF IT IMMEDIATELY!"
4,One of the best new bands out there!,"I love Maroon 5! This album has a nice blend of up tempo rock songs and slower songs. They nicely blend elements of pop, rock, funk, and soul to create a cool style. My personal favorites off the album are Harder to Breathe and This Love. Overall, it is a great album and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good music!! Another artist to check out who I am also really into right now is Howard Lee Edwards. Check him out at www.HowardLeeEdwards.com!!"
4,Good for the car.,Got this cd as a gift from the office and have enjoyed listening to it. The band does not have a consistent sound but can play slow and fast and keep the punk rock going.Enjoy
4,Insatiable Pop Funk-Ness,"I caught a video online for ""This Love"" and went out and bought the album. Catchy funk-pop. These white boys must have been worshipping at the alter of all funk-ness for a long time. The lead singer can definately be found channeling Stevie Wonder on the last track ""Sweetest Goodbye"". The entire album is well written and the band is pretty tight. However this is very much a pop album and the tunes are pretty upbeat (although the lyrics aren't necessarily). I have been listening to it non-stop since I bought it a few days ago."
4,Takes Time & Touring For Great Talent To Break Big!,"This CD came out in the summer of 2002 and it has taken 2 years for it to break to a larger audience. After hitting the road, they have polished their act, their on stage presence and their playing and singing skills. Singer Adam Levin reminds you of singer Colin Bloostone from The Zombies (British Invasion) and the soulful feeling of Simply Red. I am quite sure that if they hold together and continue to write within this soulful and skillful vain into their next album, they do have the talent to become a big international act. Nope, they are not a ""one hit wonder"". Listen and listen carefully. There's a lot of talent here. Kudos! And on to the next for 2005."
4,Bit of everything,"This has come to be one of my favorite CD's. The lead singers voice, for one, draws you in. It's very different but very nice. Some of the songs are a bit pop like, but the rest its hard to put your thumb on what they are. Definatly worth a look, though. I originally bought it just for the song ""this love"" but after listening to the whole thing, each song is really great. You won't want to skip a song."
3,I *want* to like it. I really do. But...,"I have to admit to having real trouble enjoying this album.It pains me to say such, because taken individually, I love most of the songs on it. However, taken as a whole, I find the album difficult to listen to. The arrangement on this album does not gel together very well; going from song to song comes as a brutal shock way too many times for me to handle.IMO, if the album had been arranged a little better, it would be Massively improved. I kept trying to listen through anyways to try to at least come up with an arrangement I could feel happy with (so I could post it here!), but never made much progress.All that being said, their music really is damn good, and if you don't have issue with albums not ""flowing"", then definitely pick this one up!"
5,most fabulous singing to music,"This is one of the best CDs I've ever purchased. The mix of jazzy, love and dancing around your house songs is phenomenal! This is a fun CD that is full of soul. I love every song on it!"
4,Good CD!,"This is a really good Maroon 5 CD. I liked ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"" better but, I would really recomend this CD."
4,Absolutely essential,"This is a ""must have"" for any collection. I can't stop listening to this album and make sure I have it for any road trips. This Love, Harder to Breathe, She Will Be Loved and Secret are the kind that get stuck in your head first thing in the morning and stay with you all day long."
5,A refreshing mix of rock and funk fusion,"This is Maroon 5's debut and it is a strong start to a band that shows so much promise. There are a number of songs on this album release that have become hits to the fans and romantics as well. Songs like This Love, She Will Be Loved are made for romantic evenings in with your special someone with soft slow sensual beats to slow dance too.The you have suave songs like The Sun and Sunday Morning that one would love to hold their special someone close and listen whilst relaxing on a weekend. Another great song and possibly the unsung hero of the CD release is the last song, Sweetest Goodbye. Now this is a song that should have been a hit from the start. Many of the songs are sung with a vigour by Adam that leaves many leads wanting."
5,"Try it, you won't be dissappointed!!!","I heard Maroon 5 a few years ago when they were still Kara's Folower's. They were good, but still needed their music to mature. When they changed their name and matured musically and lyrically I saw them perform at the gorge. I love them. They had such a wonderful stage presence and all of their songs are exceptional. BUY SONGS ABOUT JANE!!! Some of my favorites on the CD are: This love (I'm sure you've already heard it), Sunday Morning, Sweetest Goodbye. They also show their edgier guitar/rock side with songs like Must Get Out, and The Sun, which I love because they performed it as the sun was setting. This CD is one of my favorites, everyone who I play it for instantly falls in love with the band. Just try it, and if you love it you have to see them in concert, if not then resell it or give it as a gift. What do you have to lose?"
2,"Good, but...","Maroon 5 has a unique alternative rock sound that I like. The only thing I hate about this album, is, every song is about sex! It's the only thing they sing about! So if that bothers you, you might not want to get it."
1,Maroon 5 Sucks!!!!,"I own this CD, and it is a piece of crap! All of the songs have crappy instruments playing, and even worse lyrics. If there is a worse album out there, I would be verry surprised. Plus, I saw a show about their album on T.V., and all they were saying was ""It must be good, we played our own instruments."" What morons. Whatever you do, don't buy this CD."
2,Damn these guys are annoying,"I loved Harder To Breathe, but the rest of the album is pure garbage & filler. I understand that the lead singer might have had some relationship problems, but does he have to write about it in EVERY DAMN SONG? Theres too much pop and not enough rock also, theres more synthesizers and FX then there is guitars, bass and drums. It doesn't help that This Love is on the radio 24/7 nonstop either..."
2,Pass,"I don't know what all the hype about Maroon 5 is? Fortunately I got this album for free, otherwise I would have felt I payed way too much for it. All I can recommend is don't get this album."
1,excrutiating,"And bland beyond belief. I can only hope the Best New Artist Grammy Award Curse befalls this group. Look back in Grammy history and you will see the likes of Starland Vocal Band, Tracy Chapman, and Arrested Development as winners of that particular award whose careers went nowhere FAST. Maroon 5 are watered down, fourth division white boy blue eyed soul of the worst kind. Jamiroqui rip offs ( who themselves are Stevie Wonder rip offs ). Maroon 5 are so safe and so corporate. The lead singer has an annoying whine of a voice and his lyrics are akin to reading the poetry diary of a ""sensitive"" high school freshman. Just terrible, and unfortunately, all over the place. THIS IS WHY I DON'T LISTEN TO THE RADIO !!!!"
1,Songs About What Sorry?,"The singer whines out poems about women, the guitarist plays three alternating chords, the drummer hits a drum. The world falls at their feet."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO REAL MUSIC?,"I know this is pop music but I dont ever remember pop even sucking this much. When im flipping thru the channels and see VH1 on the only thing I see is this horrible band and John mayer and both make me want to vomit, it seems that horrible music is in style or something. Oh well in a couple of months there will be a new trend to bug the crap out of me."
2,ANNOYING,"These guys are really annoying. They do sound a little bit like a boyband, every song is about girls and love, and plus theirs just as much synthesizers as there is guitar. The drums are drum machine quality, and the bass? Hah! Is there even any bass being used? The guitar is very choppy except for in ""Harder To Breathe"". Listen to the chorus of ""This Love"", the guitar sounds really bad. If you want a bunch of love songs with more synthesizers than guitar, then this is for you."
2,Average Band Forcing Quirkiness,"I bought this unheard because Entertainment Weekly gave it a good review. They said the vocals were ""unique"" and the sound was ""very different."" Sounds good, I thought, and ordered it.Well, the ""unique vocals"" (as far as I can tell) consists of the melody jumping all over the scale; there are not any two consecutive syllables sung on the same note as far as I've noticed. Sit a kid down in front of a piano and tell him to hit one key at a time randomly and you'll get an idea of what this is like.Otherwise the music, lyrics, singer's vocal quality, etc., seems no different from any other current male group. Nothing catchy enough to sing. But not a bad album. Just not as striking as I was led to believe."
1,A Sad Story...,"The first time I listened to This Love, I was like WOW! Best song ever. Then I heard She Will Be Loved, good song too. Then Harder To Breathe, and I ran out to buy this. But I was greatly disappointed. Except for the 3 singles, the CD is plain BAD and repetitive. The CD enraged me, how come could it get so bad? And then they got commercial and did crappy videos that make me and my brother mad. I'm sorry for these guys, they should have tried harder.P.S. I gave this disc to my friend's girlfriend. Of course, she only listens to 4 tracks."
3,Over-hyped Songs About Jane album,"I purchased Songs About Jane thinking that I have found a very great album. Admittedly, I bought the cd after I heard She Will be Loved on the radio. After I listened to the songs several times, and I concentrated on the lyrics very carefully, I sold the cd."
1,Yep they suckered me with this one.,"I went out and bought ""Songs About Jane"" based upon online reviews and the impression ""Harder to Breathe"" made upon me. I am music lover of varied styles and genres, but I must agree with several reviews that this album to closely resembles 'pop, boy band music'. Do not take the single ""Harder to Breathe"" as a good indicator to the sound of the entire album. From the second track the album becomes a soft, generic sound of funk beats and groove rock. The lyrics are nothing to speak of, and the vocals began to get under my skin. If you like ""Harder to Breathe"", and you are still intrigued, then buy a used copy, for I am sure there will be no short supply. I have already traded my copy."
1,Not nice guys.,"I just wanna say that my gf is a huge fan (for some odd reason) and the one time I agreed to go with her to a Maroon 5 show proved to be a total nightmare. We stood in line for an hour waiting for an autograph, and about 1/4 of the way to the front, the entire band packed up and left. This was AFTER telling everyone they'd get their stuff signed. Everyone was like ""hey, what about us""? And do you know what these jerks said; ""too damn bad, we're leaving"". On top of that, they had some 300 black dude (security detail probably) forcably remove a 12 year old girl just for going up to them and saying ""I'm your biggest fan, I love you guys"". What kinda pus*y does that? I wouldn't give these low rent, college bar band a*holes a penny of my money, and you shouldn't either. There's much better out there if you want good pop-rock music. Thx for listening."
5,great cd,"I love this CD. It is completely fantastic, I listen to it all the time. I actually bought it from Amazon this time as a gift; I already have my own copy at home. I recommend this CD if you like songs about love and/or loss and things in that category. It's not emo and whiny at all though, it's all very well written and composed."
3,eh its alright,it has some good beats...and lyrics are kool too. but this group gives me the feeling of a boy band more than a rock group...but alright
4,a great new band!,"Maroon 5 is one of the best bands which emerged on music scene this year. After a small failure at the very beginning of their career, Maroon 5 did not give up, and re-released ""Songs about Jane"", with all the promotion that this record deserves.""Harder to breathe"", ""This love"" and ""She will be loved"" are songs which are getting lots of airplays on radio these days and are conquering positions on charts all over the world. One of my favorite songs is ""Sweetest goodbye"" and I really wish it becomes a single. If you like pop music, give it a chance, and buy ""Songs of Jane""."
4,pretty good CD,"I first heard ""this love"" on the radio and heard it was by maroon 5. I thought i should by the CD. I read the reviews on this site and they said it was good. They were right. This is such a cool and uniqe CD. You will love it. All the songs are good, accept for the last one (it's kind of stupid). I listen to the whole CD every time, not just a couple. Here are my ratings.1)""harder to breathe""- 9/102)""This love""- 10/103)""Shiver""- 10/10- My favorite song on the CD.4)""She will be loved""- 7/105)""Tangled""- 8/106)""The sun""- 7/107)""Must get out""- 8/108)""Sunday morning""- 7/109)""Secret""- 8/1010)""Through with you""- 8/1011)""Not coming home""- 9/1012)""Sweetest goodbye""- 5/10"
5,nice,It's just as good as when it came out years ago! Bought it for nostalgic reasons...THAT and they are playing a few blocks from my house in May.
5,Maroon5 review,"This cd is amazing. I would definitely tell everyone to go buy this cd. My favorite is ""She Will Be Loved,"" which will definitely be a HUGE single!"
2,Maroon 5 - Songs About Jane,"Maroon 5 hit it big with their song This Love, which I admit, was a catchy tune and I did like it and sing along. However, their album is not very solid. They've got tracks that just seem really plain and like filler tracks. The other single which was Sunday Morning is a nice song. But their other single She Will Be Loved gets on my nerves. The lead singer has a high nasaly voice but it didn't bother me in some of the songs. But in that song and some others it does. So I can't really listen to this album for more than one rotation for example so it ends up sitting there in the corner. If you like She Will Be Loved (assuming you've heard it on the radio or something) then the album should be fine but for those that don't really enjoy his voice all that much this album isn't strong."
5,No other music like this,"I just want to say after reading the last couple reviews, I am extremely nerved by the fact that these reviewers would compare Maroon 5 to hard core rock music and felt I should put my two cents in. Maroon 5 is awesome in their own right and cannot be compared to Guns N Roses or Led Zeppelin, there is a reason they call it Pop Rock. Don't get me wrong, those other rock bands are awesome, but they're called classic rock for a reason. Anyways, I think in all honesty, the people that write those reviews actually do like Maroon 5 and can't admit that to themselves so they try to display that they don't like them so they won't get caught. People, GROW UP and appreciate this for what it is. These guys are really good and can't be compared to any other band out there today. No one else that I have heard in this day and age sounds like them, so appreciate that. Enough said."
4,"Strong, Soothing, Rhythm&#65533;","I just bought this CD 2 weeks ago and I have to say that the thought out lyrics and rhythm is like nothing else. Shares alot of simularities with John Mayer with his lyrics, However his melody is like no other band I have heard. In my opinion if you listen to Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer, Jack Johnson and/or Ben Harper than Maroon 5 is for you.His single Harder to Breath has been spun a bit more than I like however She will be Loved, Must get Out, Sunday Morning <-- My Fav and Secret are all amazing. Give it a try and it will be a excellent addition to your music collection...Hope you Enjoy!"
3,Only a Handful of Decent Tunes...,"I bought this CD after hearing ""This Love"". It is a good song and I had heard ""Harder to Breathe"" before and I thought that was a pretty good song also. So I decided to buy the CD. Don't make the same mistake I did (buying the CD). There is only like 3 good songs on the whole cd, all of songs other than This Love, Harder to Breath, and Not Coming Home are just love songs and nothing is uptempo its all depressing and low key. Go to www.maroon5.com and go to the flash site and listen to the songs on the player, see what I mean."
3,Not bad...but not the greatest ethier,"Purchased this CD about a week ago, and I find it to be just average. The songs are ok in content, but it definately is not something that I would HAVE to have in the CD player. I have to say that the vocals on this record are something that I have not heard before. There is a certain edge to it, this is a good thing. It is a good record to try out, but dont expect too much out of this one!!"
5,A good album all the way through!,"Great sound for anyone. It gets to my rock side with grunge sounding guitars and hard drums, my funk side with the light funk guitars, gets to my soulful side with the voice and it's all so good together. I have to recommend the album to anyone who likes any of today's music."
5,sexy music,"its rare today to find musicians with true vocal talent, who know their instruments, and write the perfect words to accompany their perfect notes. but maroon5 does so, flawlessly and seemingly effortlessly.formerly kara's flowers, a more pop-punk sounding band, maroon5 has become a band that revels in sensual music. the more funk inspired maroon5 creates all around sexy music that doesnt come off tawdry or dirty. its the type of music that you wouldnt be embarassed if it came on your cd player in your car and your mom was sitting in the passenger seat. trust me, this is amazing stuff."
5,BUY THIS CD,"I really love this CD. I was watching a student dance show which featured an amazing solo dance to ""This Love"" and couldn't get the song out of my head (in a good way). Afterwards I bought their CD, which hasn't left my CD player since. Their songs have some cool lyrics like ""the sex she slipped into my coffee, they way she felt when she first saw me,"" and ""I twist to fit the mold that you are in""... etc., but the instrumental music behind the words is what really makes the album for me. Sometimes it sounds like it comes straight out of a Stevie Wonder album (Sunday Morning) other times it is hard rock (not coming home), but no matter what it has a really rich quality. If these guys don't become famous and get on the top 100, all my faith in the music industry will be lost. They are so much better than so many bands on the list."
5,Songs About Jane,"01. HARDER TO BREATHE: 1st single, cool, and rocky -10-02. THIS LOVE: Love it!!!, my fav. in the album, it is the 2nd single -10-03. SHIVER: Cool, and rocky like the ""Harder To Breathe"" -10-04. SHE WILL BE LOVED: A slow song...i think is the 3rd single of the album -9.5-05. TANGLED: Songs 5,7 & 8 has almost the same rhythm at the chorus and sometimes I confues 'em but the songs are cool -10-06. THE SUN: Cool -9-07. MUST GET OUT: Very cool, but really it has almost the same rhythm in the chorus -10-08. SUNDAY MORNING: ""Come adnr est your bones with me..."" very cool and cute song -10-09. SECRET: Another slow song...i don't like it very much -8-10. THROUGH WITH YOU: Cool, and has a great beat -9-11. NOT COMING HOME: This song is live, very cool it sounds so cool!! -10-12. SWEETEST GOODBYE: A little bit long, but cool at the same time -9.5-"
3,a boy band that plays instruments,"While Maroon 5 does include some nice elements into their music it would be interesting to learn a bit about this bands past and hear what they sounded like before being produced and put out. Also the lead singer tends to sound either angry about past relationships or like he's trying to get somebodies clothes off. While this is sometimes nice after repeated listens forced upon me by others I must say that they get old, fast."
5,I LOVE THIS CD,SO I bought this cd over 6 months ago and it has only left my cd player in my car when I take it inside my house to listen to it. Maroon 5 has such an awesome sound and believe it or not they are even better live.
4,Good stuff,"This is very decent CD. It sometimes reminds me a little bit of Jamiroquai's earlier albums, although it's not as intricate from a technical standpoint. Be warned that some of the tracks sound slightly like B-sides from some crap boy band, but only slightly."
5,"Hard to Describe, Easy to Like","So few words can describe the talent that is present within Maroon 5. They are the most unique thing I have heard in a long time. They combine elements of several other different kinds of music to get a style unmistakable with anyone save their own. Everytime I listen to the CD, I find myself liking more and more of their songs (it's sort of scary, actually). I see great things in the future of Maroon 5, as they have done something so many have strove to even scratch the surface of. They have found a unique voice. With great vocals, twisted (and sometimes somewhat creepy) music, lounge style piano, and the ability to the hard and the soft, Maroon 5 is a band we shold be seeing a lot of."
5,A melting-pot of stylistic songwriting! Great stuff!,"This release is fantastic and then some! You cannot pin down the band's exact style since their music is so original, and basically consists of various rock, funk, soul, and pop elements that gel perfectly in their songs. There is good music out there still. You just have to search a bit. Lately, I can't stop playing Maroon 5 and this other great great CD called 'Me Died Blue' by this awesome singer/songwriter artist named Steven Delopoulos from the New Jersey shore. I would have to say that these 2 artists have taken over my CD player over the last few months! I hope to be able to catch them both live soon."
2,Potential...,"I bought the Maroon 5 cd when I heard they were having a free concert in town. I recognized Harder to Breathe, and it was tolerable but definitely not a musical gem. The majority of the cd was a real disappointment, and I was on the verge of throwing it in my ""[unacceptable]"" cd pile when Sunday Morning came on. It was different, had lost that annoying boy band sound that sticks to the other tracks. I listened again, and they do have some songs that are reminiscent of Sunday Morning, but not of the same quality. In my opinion, if Maroon 5 moved more into the direction of these jazzier sounding songs they would be so much more successful."
4,Maroon5 terrific in concert. Good luck to 'em.,"Add me to the list of those who had never heard of Maroon5 until seeing them open for Sugar Ray & Matchbox 20. Their performance of ""This Love"" is what led me to buy their CD right there at the show. It's a GREAT song to hear live, and the CD version sounds every bit as good."
5,Bring on MAROON5!!,"1. Harder to Breathe: Great way 2 start off!(1st single) 8/102. This Love:(2nd single) #1 hit song! no explanation. 10/103. Shiver: Awesome song w/good beat! 8/104. She Will Be Loved: (3rd single)One of the highlights! 9/105. Tangled: Cool song! Nice beat. Not 2 memorable.(lol) 7/106. The Sun: AMAZIN"" song. 2 bad nt a single...yet!! 10/107. Must Get Out: Decent song....7/108. Sunday Morning: (4th single) POWERFUL and will be ahit! 8/109. Secret: It's alrit' average song. 6/1010. Through With You:Picks up the slack! 7/1011. Not Coming Home (Live): VERY good song! 7/1012. Sweetest Goodbye: hmmmm...sounds familiar....6/10I RATE PRETTY HARD SO U CAN SEE MAROON5 IS A AMAZING BAND AND HAS AWESOME SONGS 2 BACK IT UP!-IF U DONT BUY CD DOWNLOAD THESE SONGS:1.This Love2.The Sun3.Harder 2 Breathe4.She Will Be Loved5.Sunday Morning"
3,"Familiar, but pleasant","Maroon 5 seems to have absorbed many influences and have done a nice job of incorporating these influences into this CD. ""Sunday Morning"" has a nice Stevie Wonder vibe to it, ""The Sun"" sounds like an outtake from Sting's jazzier work, and ""Shiver"" almost sounds like a new one from Ricky Martin.(Man, I'm sure I'll hear it about this one.)""She Will be Loved"" lifts the CD to a higher plane with it saoring vocals and passionate lyrics but the overall feel is one of pleasant familiarity. While the thematic element of all the songs being about the same subject is a bit of a stretch, I found this quite listenable and fun, but not exactly a life changing experience."
4,It will grow on you...,"Songs about Jane was not a CD that I enjoyed when I first got. I was so sick of hearing the singles on the radio. But, then the song ""She Will Be Loved"" came on my radio and I liked it. My friend told me to take a second listen to the CD and that I would be impressed if I did. And he is right I do like it a lot better. I still skip all the singles even ""She Will Be Loved"" because up here they are played to death. The CD is not my favorite, but it is a good CD. I don't listen to it constantly because it gets annoying fast. But, I listen to it about once a month. Which is good for me. It is worth investing in, because, it gets its moneys worth in play time."
5,~*BEST CD OUT THERE!!!!!!!!!!*~,"OMG, i am in love with this cd. Maroon 5 is definitely one of the best bands currently out there. Songs about jane is such a uniquely different cd. The lyrics, the rythym, melodies, everything about this cd is just fantastic. There is nothing on this cd i dont like. one of the best songs just has to be 'sunday morning', omg, its the best song in the world! ya just gotta hear it..its such a gooood song. Trust me, GO BUY THE CD!!!!"
3,Different but Neat,"I heard a few songs on the radio so I had to go out and get the cd. big mistake. theres only about two good songs on it. its kinda nice because its different than all the stuff thats out there right now. the only good songs are: This Love, Secret and Harder to breathe."
3,Mediocre at best.,"I bought this CD for the sheer fun of it, and besides, I liked the two singles ""Harder to Breathe"" and ""This Love"". But only buy this album if you liked their previous releases because this isn't anything new, and we don't need some white guy talking about ex-girlfriends and how they screwed him over(it's been done hunny...many many times)."
4,Despite all the hype....,"I generally hate hyped up bands but Maroon 5 is a different story. This is a great album. It's got a ton of infectious hooks that you can't help but love. This album has everything from soul to funk to rock to pure pop. Adam Levine's voice is incredible, very unique."
1,Mommy make it stop!!,"Quick ! Someone get me a tourniquet, I just slit my wrists after hearing a few cuts off this tragic discharge. Congatulations boys ! You have just fused the sounds of Eminem , Toto , and Ben Folds Five, I did not think that was possible. Moron 5 is finding old ways to offend the intelligent while stealing money from the ignorant , a feat not easily obtained! Come one and come all to see these dorks belt out some hard driving regurgitated Billy Joel type melodies .This music is trite and belongs on a commercial for panty hose. I am endlessly amazed at the music industry's lack of scope and artistic integrity . This is the Archie's with better recording technology . No soul , No vision . Hey - where's that tourniquet?"
1,recent studies show.,Those who listen to Maroon 5 are highly likely to be severely mentally handicapped. thus far it is unknown whether being handicapped caused one to listen to Maroon 5 or whether listening to Maroon 5 causes one to be handicapped. mostly likely a little of both.
1,I'm soooooooo angry!!!!!!!!!!,This band is the crapiest one out there. All of their lyrics are cliche and meaningless. The airtime these guys get on the radio is so incredibly much that they practically own music stations. This band is also very one-dimensional. All they do is sing about love and garbage like that. I cannot believe this is considered rock. This should be classified with Britney Spears and other garbage.
1,"This disc sucks !! Unless you like boy bands, think NSYNC !","I bought this disc because the song, ""Harder to Breathe"" is actually pretty good. The rest of the disc, however, totally blows goats, in my opinion. I am a rocker who is open to new stuff, but this ain't it ! Besides the first song, the rest of this disc sounds like that crap you hear on top 40 stations. CORPORATE RADIO SUCKS !! Looks like I accidently stepped into the wrong genre of music. Unfortunately, I threw away my receipt and now I'm stuck with it. I guess I'll have to sell it on the used CD market for like 3 bucks. If you hear ""Harder to Breathe"" on the radio and think you want this disc, SAVE YOUR MONEY !! Just tryin' to help you out ! Later Daze-----"
1,songs about shame,THis is the most shameful album ever. IT is funk with rock in it and there are no goods ongs.
1,songs about their objects,"the minute I laid my eyes on the video of the first single and how the lead singer is on top of the girl and then singing at the mike with very limited performance skills(singing 'she said goodbye' and bouncing to the beat with a wave of the hand, what the hell is that?) I knew they were just another cheesy 15-minute pop band trying to look more credible than backstreet boys by parking themselves behind instruments and naked women via album cover"
2,I've heard this before,"I was wrestling with my CD tower the other day, and I was hit on the head by a cd. I scratched my head, and picked up what had just scraped my forehead with and it just happened to be Jamiroqui, I put it in the CD player and realized something. Maroon 5 might be a talented band, but they are no Jamiroqui, and those who think so, I challenge you to go pick up a Jamiroqui CD, one I've been listening to for 8 years. I'm not about talking crap on bands really, but come on now, I just dont see how people can go off about how ""original"" Maroon 5 are, when Jamiroqui was doing this stuff 10 years ago, and I hate to say it but with a little more ""soul""."
3,Great and Bland,"Like so many others, I bought the album after hearing Harder to Breathe a few times. In brief, if you've heard HTB, the you've heard about a third of the songs. If you've heard anything by Evan and Jaron, Nine Days, or any other bubblegum rock band of the early 2000's you've heard another third of their songs.The last third (mostly in the later parts of the disc) is where the good stuff is. Sunday Morning woke me up from daydreaming with its cool bleusy piano and slow groove. Secret starts as a tonal experiment, and continues to intrigue... strongest song lyrically. Not Coming Home and Sweetest Goodbye both start out with average verses, but have tight refrains which really got into my head.My chief complaints about this album are: very little expressiveness, repetetive guitar rhythms, cliche lyrics, lead singer's grating voice, and an overall lack of emotion (something which I usually don't notice in groups until its all too obvious)"
3,good but...,"Don't get me wrong I love "" Harder to Breathe"" and ""this love"" but the lead singers voice is nasal and annoying after a while. That is why I won't be purchasing this album. It is getting alot of play on tv anyway. That is good enough for me. On the good side the band plays really well and I enjoy that, good funky music and I hope to hear more of them in the future when the lead singers voice matures."
1,I am going to beltsand my ears off.,"Why?Why on God's Earth did anyone think we needed to hear this?I'm pretty sure this is the surest sign the four horsemen are on their way.I can't listen to a song on hear without either crying from the pain. It hurts too badly. This is all wrong. This guy sounds like Carly Simon. It's painful. Like being run over again and again and again.""She Will Be Loved"" is in the running for ""Song Most Likely Played on Repeat in Hell.Audio abortion."
1,If I have to see this lead singer rolling around.........,".....with another chick in a video, I'm going to smash my TV!!! How full of himself is this clown?Anyway, on to the music. Why? Are these people actually moved by this tripe? Do they actually like making this mass appeal/market rubbish, or do they just see dollar signs? A hybrid of Justin Timberlake, Matchbox 20, and Jamoruquai (sp), 2 out of 3 who totally stink. This music leaves you feeling empty and hollow. No substance behind any of it, made to produce hits and income and not feelings. Thumbs down."
2,Jane Must Be A Very Monotonous Lass Indeed!,"Some of my friends recommended this group so I thought I'd givethem a listen. What I found was a rather tedious effort by rankamateurs. The material is copied from others before them. I detected a number of wrong harmonies, chords that didn't fit withthe melodic lines sung. There were also a number of false startswhich should have been edited out. Maybe they were given free studio time on the engineers night off! I did find one positiveaspect of this group which is the drummer. He is very good and the only energy in the group. What is he doing with the other four is a question only he can answer!"
5,Damn Good Ablum,"This is a very good ablum. Every track has a reason for being on the ablum. The lead singer has a different yet fimiliar sound and the band compliments him well. Buy it. Even if you haven't heard it, it's worth it. Once you get home play it until every song is stuck in your head. Than play once more for some else and make them do the same."
5,Soulful rock... to say the least.,"I've followed Maroon5 since they were Kara's Flowers. With the addition of James Valentine (bass) to the band, they changed their name to Maroon (briefly) and then Maroon5. As this band has grown up, their music has as well. ""Songs About Jane"" is one of the most amazing albums I've heard - from an independent (recently noticed) band. With their first single ""Harder To Breathe"", they draw you in and keep you going with each amazing track they have to offer. With the seductive lyrics they pour out of their souls, to the outstanding music they lay out for the taking - Maroon5 has single handedly created an album that will be around forever. You can not compare them to anyone else and do them (or the other band) any justice. They have an amazing sound that only Maroon5 could pull off. I hope this review was helpful - it's hard to put into words how fantastic this album is. It's definitely worth the purchase price!"
5,watkins cookbook 1938,"My grandma cooked from this book, then my mother, now me. It is a very good cookbook with recipes memorative of the old time Sunday dinner on the ground when esch woman tried to outdo the other. I love this cookbook, it's the one I use most frequently."
5,Book Order,"Labeled ""very good"". Shipped quickly and arrived in the specified time. Arrived in the condition stated. Chapters 1 and 2 had some underlines otherwise like new."
2,caution before buying this book,"I was pretty disappointed in this book. It didn't seem relevant at all to issues most couples face today. It seemed like it might be helpful for clergy who are counseling 20 year old virgins but not for mental health therapists or anyone counseling adults. It just really missed the mark and didn't help me at all. I already do some couples counseling and was hoping to sharpen my skills; I don't think I learned anything from this book. Again, I'd stay away from this book unless you are counseling very conservative people in a church setting."
3,From MOO2 to GalCiv2,"Wow, this thing is really like MOO2. It's a worthy effort with some cool twists, but over all I feel like it lacks the real punch that could've pushed it over the top. I've played 3 games so far and feel that the race relations haven't really evolved since the MOO2 and would've had a profound impact to the game.Overall I find it fun to play, just lacks the WOW! factor. Maybe a GalCiv3?"
4,Good strategy game,"Strategy game is improvement over original, but graphics are harder to use and less clear than original."
2,"Vista Users, Beware!!","Although the game is advertised as being compatible with Windows Vista, the game constantly hangs/crashes on my system. Furthermore, there are numerous sound issues in the game with Vista. Technical support has yet to respond to me. Seems like a good game on XP systems, but avoid like the plague if you have Vista!"
2,Problem with game freezing with some graphics card,"I was able to play the game for a few rounds when it froze. There's a problem with the Nvidia Geforce Go 7900 GS equipped computers with Vista. There are on-line forums that outlines which graphics cards don't work with the game. Supposedly, there's a bug in the driver and they haven't fixed it so there's no way for me to play the game unless I buy a different graphics card equipped laptop or get a little smarter in finding a program to update the driver. Which I am a little hesitant because I don't want to download something that can destroy my computer. Unless you have a different graphics card. Don't buy the game. It's actually a great game but because of the horrible support for the driver for laymen like me, I would rather not have purchased the game.... All it does for me now is taunt me whenever I see the game box sitting on my shelf."
2,ok,"ok, not as good as I had hoped, nothing really new, missing things I had enjoyed in older games, however, good AI."
1,Hyped all the way,If you tell stardock whats wrong with their stuff they turn into cry babies and cancel your account. I was one of their first beta testers. In the past I have filed a complaint against them to the Federal Trade Commission and put their trash where it belongs.
4,"Good, but not great","Ok, this is a decent game. I love strategy and even turn-based stuff. I play it all the time. That said, I cringe to say this too: this game can become quite boring. Don't get me wrong: it's not boring all the time, but it lacks a certain spark. the tech tree is quite bland, and it lacks any useful info about WHAT the tech does. It is also a little TOO straightforward...for instance you research Torpedos I, then Torpedos II, and so on...with that being the only listed improvement.All in all, its a fair game, but I am going back to some older turn based space strategies."
3,Galactice civ,Its a really fun game but would be better with multilayer. Id get the original game but i would not get the expansion like dark avatar and gold edition just not worth it with out online play.
2,too many details,I used to play these type of games but this one is kind of boring - If there were ship captains that would be cool but it is too much micromanagement
5,Addictive,"This game is highly addictive, beware! There are many ways to play (strategies to use), tons of map setup options, the ship customization is simple yet very flexible, and the graphics and menus are streamlined and pretty. Initial learning curve may be moderate for some but with even a short websearch you will find an easy read to help you grasp the few not-so-obvious points in the game. After playing a couple times the play will come naturally and you will have a hard time tearing yourself away from the game. Additionally, the product support, update system, and overall care the developers have put and continue to place in this game is top-notch in the industry. Enjoy!"
4,Most interesting for its seeming authenticity and variety.,"I was quite taken with what was for me a refreshing type of cuisine, that long appreciated from afar, was presented to myself as a novice in very approachable terms. I would be most interested to see what is in store for this author in her next supplement."
5,Alternative Title: Asian Food Demystified,"This small paperback not only demystifies the Asian grocery, but also the Asian recipe and menu. I was able to quickly look up items that I couldn't spell but had long been curious about because the book is organized by the sections in the grocery. After quenching my initial curiosities, I had to sit down and read the interesting book cover to cover. Each ingredient is discussed as to appearance, taste, texture, uses, history and quality with references to preferred brands or possible substitutes. There are a few basic recipes included to try right away, but this book best serves as a supplement to other Asian and vegetarian cookbooks and in preparation for shopping or dining. My only disappointment was not finding the recipe for Sweet Thai Tea listed in the index but omitted from the content."
1,Don't buy this,"I bought this and used it a couple of times on my kids with no problems, except that my kids did not like being sprayed. This weekend we took it to the pool and it would not spray. There is nothing we could do to get it working again. Dangerous to be caught without a backup sunscreen!"
2,Kind of sticky but no stains,Pros-*super easy to use*lets you reach difficult spots on your own since you don't have to reach to rub it in*very fast to apply*it seems to last a long time based on how you can feel the residue on your body (though I would still reapply per directions to be on the safe side)Cons-*sticky rather than smooth like a lotion*doesn't always come out right (should be a mist but sometimes a stream comes out)*supposed to be no rub but sometimes it comes on unevenly and you have to rub it in*bad smell*have to be sure and close your mouth because it tastes terrible if any gets in there*my son hates having it sprayed on (I think because it is cold)[update- he doesn't seem to mind it anymore}*bottle gets very slippery miduse*sometimes it stops working as you are applying it (the control gets stuck?)*takes a bit of force to get it to work (at least my bottle was like that)I don't plan to buy it again. I'll use what we have left but that's it. Great idea though.
1,STAINS ORANGE,Took me forever to figure out what was ruining all my white/light colored clothing!Realized it was the sunscreen and the hard water at the cottage!Don't use in hard water! Clothing is ruined!!
2,A Disappointment -- Not that interesting or well-written,"Based on the reviews, I expected more from this book than I got. The story didn't keep my interest. The characters had potential but didn't live up to it. There are so many other good historical romances out there where the author creates interesting and believable characters and puts them in an interesting and believable environment. This book used up my suspension of disbelief about a third of the way through."
5,Sex-ay!!,"Every time I hear Sandy Hingston has a new one coming out I wait, with bated breath, and never am I disappointed! For this one, she went all out. Characters I fell in love with, a romance that's the stuff of dreams, sex scenes that are, well, dripping with steaminess. If you love romances--and who doesn't, really?--you MUST pick this one up. Now!"
3,shows promise; needs work,"I must agree with the editorial review posted above and written by Lynne Welch of the American Library Association: the inconsistencies in language, setting, and behavior detract from the overall quality of the book. It was offputting to hear early nineteenth century characters using modern slang. And the plot is improbable to the point of unbelievability. Plus, the major characters aren't even likeable. That said, Hingston shows promise; her writing style is in many ways excellent for a romantic author, she just needs to put more work into her books and TO BE BETTER EDITED!"
4,Dessert Saucer would be more accurate name IMHO,"Of course Spode Italian earthenware quality is gorgeous so it requires an appropriate high rating for that reason.But naming this bowl a ""cereal bowl"" is ridiculous. Who eats such a small amount of cereal unless you are a baby or toddler? The bowl is just a little over one inch deep. One cup (8 oz.) fills it to an adequate level without over doing it. Half a cup of cereal with half a cup of milk anyone? I don't think so.It does make a nice small serving bowl for condiments or is good for serving a dessert with sauce."
3,You can certainly go whitout this,I received it as a gift and used it for the first month or so until I realised it's just one more thing to remember to do... to press some button! It doesn't really do much. You don't need a timer to remember to feed your baby or change the diaper or to put him to sleep.
3,"Favorite baby item, until it blanked out","This was my absolute fave baby item, until it just started blanking out. Six months after we started using it, it just goes out, as if the batteries are dead... but they aren't. Then I have to take the batteries out and put them back in for it to start up again (plus reset the timers and clock). It started out once or twice a day, but now it's five or six times a day."
2,Poor QC and only lasted 3 Months,"I admit there aren't any of this sort of baby timer in the market and to be honest, it IS a big help for first time parents. Even my hubby who is usually skeptical of fangled gadgets heaps praise on it.However, if you read the fine print on the manual, it only has a 90 day warranty. Right after my baby turn 3 months old, the timer went blank. I gave it a change of battery, I even cleaned the contacts where the batteries would connect to. Nothing worked. I opened up the unit to look inside and found that the wire that connects to the battery wasn't soldered on properly. On further investigation I saw some components were dead, but I'll spare you the details.In short, it has poor quality control by the manufacturer. I wouldn't pay this much for something that spoils this easily, I would have given this one star if it isn't for the fact that it was a great help while it lasted."
3,Doesn't save enough information to be useful,"I used this for my baby's first month, but in the end, it left me frustrated. The pedetrician wants to know how many bowel movements, how long he slept total, etc... This just tracks the last one. I recommend not getting this and downloading the free app- What to expect.com."
4,Must have baby gadget,"Sometimes a simple single purpose gadget is the best way to go. The Itzbeen definitely fits into this category. When you are trying to feed, calm a fussy baby, the last thing on your mind is updating a log book or setting alarms for the next feeding. Just click the button and deal with the bookkeeping later, if you forget, the alarm will still remind you for the next feeding.As far as smartphone apps go, click, swipe to unlock, optional passcode, find the app, launch, wait and finally mark the event is too much for a sleep deprived parent to do with one hand while shushing a frantic baby.One small gripe:- Adjusting when the alarm goes off will reset the timer. So, if you decide to go 4 hours at night instead of 3 in the day, you have to go alarmless for an entire feeding cycle. Big bummer! Might be better if it left the timer alone when you press & hold to adjust the alarm."
5,Must have for twins!,"Perfect for parents of twins. We use ours religiously as we would be lost without it. It really helps put order to the chaous in the early days. Knowing the last time a baby was fed or when they were changed helps you resolve the crying in short order. We have one for each child as they don't stick to a schedule just yet. Also, for new parents, you cannot imagine how little sleep you will get in the early days and this product really helps you remember the important things. It is simple, but it works. We will be recommending this to all our friends with new borns... especially those with multiples!"
3,Old technology,"1) This product only works well if you are type A enough to click it everytime you change, feed, or put the baby to sleep. (I am) But it was annoying to have to remember to throw yet another thing into the diaper bag. And I forgot it about half the time.2) I went through a new set of batteries every 2 weeks (kind of annoying)3) After about 6 months of using it, I dropped it from about 3 feet up and the buttons don't work (very annoying)4) About the same time I broke it, I got an iPhone and a friend recommended the TOTAL BABY app. It's 4.99 but much more useful than the itzbeen because you can record milestones, doctor visits, growth, vaccinations, etc.Save your money, if you have an iPhone or Android, get a baby timer app such as TOTAL BABY."
2,Not so useful....,"We got this to keep track of the times baby is fed and all the other things newborns do. The concept behind the product is great, how long has it been since I last fed my child? They accomplish this half way. The reason I say this is because it does not have any memory options. So basically you get short term reminders, meaning, it will tell you the time since the very last time you changed a diaper.This product would be very useful if it could track a few days worth of activities, then you could identify patterns and even have that information available to discuss with dr. if needed. In order to achieve this, you still have to write times down, so, just skip this, save your money and simply use paper."
5,An absolute Godsend,"We have 2 of these. The Itzbeen is a wonderful reminder and communication device. We even used the timer function during pregnancy to tell us when it had been 2 hours after a meal, so my wife would remember to check her glucose level. Even timed contractions with it.Diapers, feeding, whatever it is, the itzbeen knows how long as long as you've pushed the button. Perfect for people with newborns who are frazzled or taking shifts.Best features: the beeping timer, handy clip, light-up background"
1,I really wanted to like it but poorly built,"Fantastic idea with some useful functions, especially when nursing. However, the battery life sucked. Ate through a set of batteries every week. I finally had to give up."
4,Useful tool for new moms!,"As a new mom, I find this product to be very useful. During the first few weeks with my newborn son it was hard for me to remember when I last fed or changed him as one event seemed to blur into another! It has been great in determining my son's eating patterns after the first month when we got into more of a routine and the nightlight is so helpful for night time nursing! It is not perfect though and it would be more useful if it would keep a daily record of each feeding, diaper change, etc for tracking. Overall, a cool tool for moms but not something you can't live without.Makes a fun baby shower gift!"
4,Great for the First time mom.,"I wish I had this with my first born. With him I was writing everything down and I had a horrible time trying to keep track of last feedings and when I took my meds last. This time with my daughter it just seems like I have every thing under control and I am not needing to remember times. I did use it a lot more to time my contractions vrs. time baby's needs. It is a wonderful and awesome idea for someone who needs to keep track of the baby's needs, so if you are in the market for that then this is the product for you. I just think that as a second time mom I am finding it easier to meet my baby's needs with out a timer."
5,"Worked very well for us, so we bought for our friends","In our experience, the device is perfect. When I purchased it - just a few days after our baby was born - my wife was did not appreciate its utility. However, because we had other family members visiting and helping, she quickly became attached to the device. We have subsequently given the device to friends as gifts and they all agree that it serves an important purpose. Some of the negative reviewers note that they were not able to consistently use the device. I understand that may be the situation for some families. However, if you can train yourself to push the buttons and not lose the device, I believe that you will be happy with this useful tool."
5,A Late Night Godsend,"This honestly seemed like a dumb idea to me - a series of timers to let you know how long it has been since you changed a diaper, fed the paper, or put her down for a nap?The truth is, this has been a great help to my wife and I. The biggest benefit that we have seen is the middle of the night, when the baby wakes us up crying and we have no idea when she fed last or had a diaper. All you need to do is check the timer and see if you fed her five minutes or two hours ago.I also love the added ""little"" features. Having a flashlight helps with checking on baby and walking down unlit halls to the diapers. The reminder slider at the bottom lets my wife know which side she fed on last, and having an additional button is handy, although I will admit that we have not used it much.I will probably get one of these for every baby shower that we go to from now on, and the price is unusually reasonable for a baby item, which I have found to be overpriced."
4,Easy to use,I've had this timer for a couple of days and it's helped out a lot so far. I really like how simple it is to use and that an alarm will go off if your baby is in a diaper for too long (or if you forgot to reset the timer). It has a nightlight feature and a lighted LED display for nighttime use. Definitely a great buy for the money.
3,It's Ok,"I definitely used this for times in between feedings, other than that it wasn't useful. It would be great if it had a counter for each wet and soiled diapers instead of the timer. The left and right sides toggle are very useful as well!!!Update: Now at baby's 3 month mark we no longer use it at all. We're keeping it because we could see a use in the future for it..."
3,"Not a must-have, but cute~!","I just had to have one of these little baby timers. It was a pain setting up and proved to be even a bigger pain to use. Great idea and I think very helpful if everyone taking care of the baby will use it, but for us pen/paper worked out fine. So I have since passed it on to new parents (maybe it will be their saving grace). I'd say if you're curious -- buy it and try it."
1,Display didn't work,"This might have been a useful baby care item if the display worked. We received this as a gift from our registry. When we arrived home with baby we hadn't set up the Itzbeen yet because the baby came surprisingly early. We took the timer from the package, inserted new batteries, and the entire right side of the display was cut off. The timer would keep track of hours but not minutes. We called the manufacturer who returned our call a week later. In the meantime we contacted Amazon to return the item. Amazon sent a replacement, which arrived a couple weeks later. The replacement works, but we didn't have the timer to use in those critical first weeks when you really need to keep track of this information and are too tired to do so. Use a clock, a pen, and paper - cheaper and more reliable."
2,Could be better,"Thought this should and could do more. It just keeps track of how long it's been. So it really is just 4 timers in one without alarms for each. For what it does, it should sell for $10! Wish it had memory to keep track daily. I still had to write down everything anyway since the doctor always wanted to know daily totals."
1,Completely worthless,"I was given the timer by a friend in celebration of baby #5. I don't understand what anyone would need it for. When a baby cries, you feed it, if it smells change it and they will sleep when they're tired. I have never with any of my children had to write down what I did and when I did it, because frankly it didn't matter. Baby #4 was on a biliblanket for 2 weeks and had to be fed about every 2 hours, so that's what I did, not that hard to look at a clock and figure out about 2 hours. With multiples I could see how it could be more useful, but otherwise just not necessary. It's just one more way for companies to step in-between the mother/child relationship."
1,Broken Item times 2,"I bought this item thinking that it would be a great idea except that when I received it in the mail the screen was malfunctioning. So I took the item and returned it for a replacement only to have the same problem again. So back to Amazon, this time for a refund."
1,bought 2 and returned 2,"this product is a great idea, but seems to be done poorly. We purchased one, it ate batteries every 3 minutes. We returned it and bought a 2nd and it had electrical problems also."
1,There's an app for that...,"#1 - Only a first time parent thinks anyone needs to report with this much accuracy what your baby is doing.#2 - As a first time parent, I though this was a GREAT idea and bought one. I though ""Surely my doctor wants to know what kind of schedule my baby is on"". Your doctor does not care. Your doctor will laugh at you if you bring in this information.#3 - People will make fun of you. Remember, if you really want accurate information, you have to take it with you everywhere you go and press a button with every poop.#4 - My husband found an iPhone app that does the same thing for 1.99, so if you REALLY think you need this (which you don't), save some money and just get the app. You have your iPhone with you everywhere anyway."
2,Handy for a short time,"I bought this when my second child was born and I was trying to keep track of feedings, medication times (I was recovering from a c-section) and diaper changes. It was useful for the first couple weeks, but after that I really didn't need it anymore. I don't think it was worth it in hindsight. Once I was done with my pain meds it was really useless."
1,DOA,It won't even turn on! It was DOA - Dead on Arrival. Great product! Can't even return it because I opened the package! How can I know it doesn't work if I don't open the package???
4,Finally found a use for it,"With a jaundiced new born, there was no need for this. We all got our sleep. He knew night from day. Just ended up being a nice night light for middle of the night feedings.Fast forward 2 months and he needed to be put on medication for a hemangioma. Problem was, it upset his stomach. The key was if he kept it down less than so many minutes, re dose. If he kept it down more than so many minutes, he is good. So this has been so useful timing his meds.Perfect to have on hand. Like I said, worst comes to worst you bought yourself a very useful portable night light!"
5,Very simple and useful,"My husband and I use this every single day. We can easily see how long it's been since our son ate, since I have pumped, etc. You can also set an alarm to sound after a certain amount of time. Totally useful and easier than watching the clock, because the times start running together after a while."
3,Is nice if is your first and only baby!,"Works nice but if you have two babies like me you will need another (one each baby) because they will not have everything synchronized but other than this detail is that it helps more if you are not used to take care of a baby, if you do you will not need this timer."
4,Great product,Without I would totally lose track of feedings. I do wish it kept a log. I also used this when my 2.5 year old was born to track meds.
3,great if you have sitter..,This is great if you have someone else taking care of your baby or if you have a baby that needs medication or something. It is not too hard to remember to feed your baby but when you need to remember when to give him medication or something it is a great reminder!
1,IT'Z A PIECE OF A CRAP!!!!DON'T BUY WASTE OF MONEY!!!!! I,"I bought one of these thinking it would help me and my wife out.The only thing i got was a pile of junk.I put brand new batteries in and within a few minutes it started losing power, like the batteries were dead. I took the batteries back out and put them back in, the same thing happened.I tried another brand new set and the same thing.I tried contacting the company but they won't call me back.So I suggest staying away from this.You'll save time, money and grey hair from being pissed that you got ripped off."
1,Dumd de dum DUMB,Seriously? This product is real. Wow. I think that if you would follow the cues of your baby them why on earth would you need this....
2,I never needed one of these.,Ok first of my son is now 3 yrs old. and he's the only child i have. I never needed no self timer thing ma bob. U go by ur babys cues. even if ur tired and sleep deprived. This litttle gadget is just another way of getting money out of new parents. when honeslty they don't need it. do u think that back in the day parents needed things like these.. NO.. Sorry but i think it's silly. save ur money. and let ur motherly instincts do the work for u.. A baby is way easier to take care of then a 3 yr old toddler. and even then i dont need no timer for him..
1,Broke on day 2,"I kinda liked the product when I first opened it but it broke on day 2. Disappointed. If it doesnt brake for anyone, just like someone else wrote on the review, memory function will be a huge plus. I still got confused when was the last I fed, changed diaper, and how long baby slept and etc."
3,never really used it,"Its cool if you actually use it. I think with the chaos of a new baby, I needed a reminder to remind me to use this thing. It is rather small as well, probably another reason why I didnt use it because it got lost in the couch cushions so many times. It does have a clip so u can carry it with u, but it gets in the way. Neat idea, yet poorly executed. Maybe one that is magnetic to put on ur fridge instead!"
2,Useful as a timer,I bought this timer when I first started caring for my grandchild thinking it was hard to remember when she last ate and slept.By the time I tried it I found I really didn't need it. I kept it as a timer for my other grandchildren to keep computer use limited and fair. I should have sent it back but I have used it so kept it.
4,A big helper,this product is great. me and my husband are first time parents and when we take turns at night its easier just to see what time the baby ate instead of waking my husband just to ask him. It also helps when your tired and have a lot on your mind and forget to look at the time when you feed the baby instead you just push the button. This item could be improved by keeping track of how much he ate at what time that would make a great difference but other then that this product is worth the money.
5,Amazing customer service,This product is amazing. I had a problem with the first timer that was sent so I contacted customer service at Coast Innovations. They responded immediately (on a Saturday afternoon) and sent me a rush replacement to make sure that I received it before our baby arrived. VERY IMPRESSIVE. The tool itself is wonderful and I plan to get this for all of my expecting friends.
2,Clip broke while trying to install batteries,I was very excited to get my Itzbeen timer up and running and just put the batteries in. The clip on the back just snapped off as it doesn't really seem to allow enough room to get the three AAA batteries in. I don't know how much I would have actually used a belt clip but I know it would have been helpful in the diaper bag or my purse- to make it easier to find. A little dissapointing.
4,Luv it but wish the clip didn't break,I first saw this advertised in a baby magazine and thought it was just silly. Then my baby was born and I realized that when u throw in sleep deprivation it can be very difficult to remember how long its been since the baby _______ . The timer is great as is the night light and L/R switch at the bottom is helpful for breastfeeding. My only complaint is that the handy clip on the back broke almost immediately but it's still worth buying.
4,Itzbeen timer,"The shipping was fast, and the product arrived weeks before the baby did. Since he's been born, it has been very helpful for tracking feedings and diapers. The only thing wrong with the unit, in my opinion, is the clip broke off the first day. I would love to return it because the clip would be handy to have, but I no longer have the box. (lesson learned!)"
1,not really needed,We got this timer as a gift and it just simply isn't needed. At least not for us. We never really used this other than to use the light on it as a flashlight to check on our son as a newborn.
3,Good product,"This product worked pretty well, but I had to remember to always have it handy. I actually ended up finding a app on my phone that did the same thing for free. And since I was more likely to have my phone near me, that worked better."
2,Whats all the fuss about?,"I was certain this was going to be a lifesaver but I've realized its not. I mostly just use it for flashlight mode.In the beginning when your baby is eating every 2-2.5 hours, you'll know when your baby is hungry. You'll also likely remember when they went to sleep and when you changed their diaper.I dont know if maybe this is more useful if you have multiples? Just not sure why everyone thinks you need it."
4,It remembers so you don't have to,"I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers. With the touch of one button, I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby. I don't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone. The first unit I was sent was defective and I received terrific customer service when I contacted the company. I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well. Maybe a future model."
1,"Poor quality, wont last a year.","Poorly made product! Worked fine for the first 4 months and then started to have problems. First, the alarm started to fail. Now, I cant even adjust the time to get it right.By the way, this was my 2nd itzbeen in 5 months. The first one just did not display anything."
2,Great if you are not ASLEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Hi I bought this product and it is great if you are not asleep as long as you are awake you can here it but if you have a newborn and you need to wake up to feed them this will not help at all it is not loud enough and you will miss feeding your baby. Other than that it is a great product to keep you on tract.
5,Extremely useful!,"I'm a self proclaimed gadget geek, and when I saw this, I jumped all over it!My wife was a little wary of it, thinking it was just another gimmick, but as soon as our son was born, she was sold. We used this religiously for at least the first month. It is priced very well and has no wasted features. The little nightlight is useful for checking in on your infant.I would recommend this to any new parents.You think you can remember how long it has been between feedings, and which breast was used last, and how long the baby has slept, but you are on such an endorphin rush sleepless fog that you really can't. The Itzbeen takes care of your brain for you."
4,a MUST HAVE for new (tired) parents,"We got this product as a gift and did not realize at the time how necessary it is! In a new parents' tired confused stupor waking every hour to 2 hours for weeks at a time, it is hard to remember what happened over the course of a blurry sleepless night. This was mostly useful at night. My husband was very helpful taking turns getting up in the middle of the night but without referring to the itzbeen, I would have to wake him back up to find out whether he fed her, changed her diaper, when he got up last, etc.The only downside is that the timers have been resetting themselves lately. Maybe the batteries are dying...We're definitely going to buy the Itzbeen as gifts for expecting friends / family!"
5,Recommended,"When my older sister had her first daughter she decided to buy only what she'd really need - nothing extra. This was one product that she has highly recommended; one that (sleep deprived) parents should own. I even told a friend about it who bought one and who says she doesn't know what she'd do without it. Now that I'm pregnant I've bought one. I saw how easy to use it is and how much it helped my sister, especially in the beginning. She has continued to use it with her second child.An added bonus is that Itzbeen will ship internationally for an affordable price. Since I live abroad that has been very convenient, especially since they don't sell them where I live. Thank you Itzbeen!"
3,"I thought I'd love it, but I'm just ""meh""","I really hoped I'd love this product but I'm finding that it's only useful to track time between feedings. It's an awful lot of money to spend for just that purpose. If you really plan on micromanaging your baby's life and timing everything you will love this. Otherwise a pad and paper work just as well if you only want to track feeding time, like my husband and I do."
1,didn't work,"i thought it would be a great thing to have, i think it's useless. you need to change the diaper as needed not in certain amount of hours, especially poopy ones. also it's better to feed on demand. so this thing is left unused.plus mine just didn't work - the numbers were shown partially, so i could never figure out what number it was. it faded really quick."
4,Two little complaints,First I'd like to say I really do love my timer and I don't know what I would do without it. It makes handing baby off to grandma or daddy SO much easier because I don't have to guess on what time this or that happened last. My only two complaints are that A) I hate where the batteries go. Its the MOST inconvient spot. B) that its not chargeable. I really wish I could plug it in at night and not have to worry about batteries. Other than that I reccomend it to EVERYONE and LOVE LOVE LOVE it.
5,"I may not be able to chart everything, but I can press a button.","My baby is a preemie, so charting how often she eats, how much she sleeps, the last time I changed her diapers (if she doesn't have enough wet diapers, she's probably not eating enough), and so forth is a big deal.This seemed like a luxury item for me. I mean, surely I could remember to write down how long something took, right? Uh, not so much. But I could simply press a button and start a timer that counts how much time has passed for an activity or event. This little device is a God send. (Note that you can set an alarm if you need to ensure that something happens within a set period of time. I set an audible alarm to ensure that my baby eats at least every 4 hr, for example.)Very glad I got this. It's very easy to use.Note that the blue color is more of a silver."
5,Itzbeen Baby Care Timer,I bought the Itzbeen for my daughter to help with the stress of having a new baby. She loves it and takes it everywhere with her. The product is so easy and quick to use I wish I had one when my children were young.
4,Great Device for Baby Wise Parents,"This is a great tool for use in conjunction with princpicles outlined by the Baby Wise book. It is great to keep you on task so that your baby is sleeping/eating on a schedule that works best for you, regardless of whether you breastfeed or bottlefeed your baby. Really good idea."
5,BEST tool ever!,Absolutely the best tool I had in my toolbox when I had my baby. I have recommended it to every new mother I know!
3,Decent product but not as useful as I hoped,I reaqlly bought this more for my wife but neither of us found that we used it much after a few days. Seemed like a nice idea at the time. The up side is that it seems pretty well made and is reasonably easy to use.
3,Could be a better product with a few modifications,"I quickly found in my daughter's first days that the product would be exponentially more useful if it retained more than just the most recent feeding, diaper change, etc. Our baby was jaundiced and the pediatrician asked how many wet diapers she had been having each day and how many times she was nursing and for how long - all of which I had to keep written down in a notebook because this product didn't allow me to review all activity for a 24-hour period."
4,Helps the sleep deprived parent keep track...,"We use two of these for our twins. Being so sleep deprived we were tending to forget when the last feeding was and possibly leading to overfeeding as a result. That doesn't happen now. Also it helps if you're working in shifts with your spouse. You can simply hand off the timer and it instantly communicates how long it's been between feedings, diapers, etc."
5,No more guessing game!,"Well its really true, parents who are sleep deprived sometimes mixed things up and double the feeding time. Sometimes keep guessing ohh what time was the last feeding or diaper time?.. itzbeen how many hours? Well this product has been very helpful to us and I thank the inventor of it. Great idea! Its a nice small device it keeps the time for you of when the last feeding or diaper was done. It has four timers actually but we only use pretty much two, thats for the feeding and diaper. Each of the four timers has its own alarm, I only use the feeding timer do its alarm. When it alarms the timer's button will be blinking red and has a gentle beeping sound. After like about 30 seconds the beep sound stops but the timer's button will still blink until you press it for reset. This product mainly tells you how long time have passed like 1 hr 42 mins ago for feeding or 2 hrs 22mins for diaper etc. I highly recommend this product for parents with newborn."
1,Waste of money!,"I thought this product would be good for communicating with the daycare provider. We could get an idea of when baby ate, slept and had a diaper change. I thought it would allow us to review a history of when these things happened so we could view baby's schedule for the day. Instead it only shows how much time has passed since the last time those things happened. What a waste of money. Wish I could return it, but it came in that clamshell packaging that had to be cut open to get it out."
1,Minus 10 Stars,"This timer is a piece of junk. I would review it as minus 10 stars, if they'd let me. We put in new batteries. The timer worked for five minutes and then shut down. We changed the batteries. Same thing. What good is a timer that keeps shutting down? This item is worthless and is not of the quality one would expect from Amazon. I don't really write reviews, but I wanted others to know that this thing is a piece of junk."
1,Didn't last 2 months,"I wish I would have read some of the negative reviews before buying this simply on the positive ones. This poorly built little device worked fine for almost 2 months before it just died. The display just went blank. Of course, my first thought was that the batteries were dead. After replacing them with new batteries, the display showed a bunch of partial digits, then faded away. If I paid 5 dollars, I probably wouldn't care as much. Before buying this, READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, not just the positive ones."
1,doesn't work,"Bought this at Babies R us and like many other reviews I just read the display doesn't function properly and I can't set the clock. I've tried changing the batteries and that's not it. I will be returning it to the store. Not sure if I'll try a second, but based on the reviews, if I do I won't leave the parking lot until I've tested it. Update 1/27 - I tried another one, again at Babies R us and that one had the same problem - the display doesn't work. It's a good concept, but I would not recommend it unless you're getting it for yourself and have the patience to go thru many until you find one that does work and then keep your fingers crossed that it lasts while you need it."
5,an essential,"This is a seemingly simple but absolutely essential and useful gadget for us! Itzbeen has lessened the stress of remembering -- and that is vital if you're taking care of a baby.Itzbeen is highly recommended. Every new or veteran parent should at least try it. If you don't like it, don't return it to Amazon, ""gift"" it instead to other parents. They'd appreciate it."
2,Better options out there,I thought this was useful until I discovered the BabyConnect app for iphone. That is much more versatile and lets me keep track of only one device (my phone).
2,Didn't Need,"Great concept, but I have not used this once because I find that my smart phone app is easier to use and has more features. If you have a smart phone, I highly recommend skipping this product and just using your phone (which you are going to have on you at all times anyway)."
4,Useful for new sleep-deprived parents sharing duty,"Some of the reviews here made us nervous about buying the product, but overall, we've found it extremely useful for coordinating care for our newborn. We have not experienced the quality issues after using it for 5 weeks. I also keep a paper log of the items this product tracks, but since my husband can remember to push a button, but not to write a diaper change or nap in the log, this makes it much easier to coordinate care. It's especially helpful late at night, when I'm waking up after just a few hours of sleep, to determine if I need to nurse him. It includes a back lite as well as a small flashlight, which is great when you need it but don't want to wake everyone up with the overhead lights. One feature that would make this better is a counter, to track how many times a timer has been reset in a 24 hour period."
5,Very useful!,"After several feedings, diaper changes, baby sleeps and poos/pees, It is hard to track when was the last time?This product is very intuitive and easy to use. Don't think, just buy it!"
4,This is a great tool for taking care of the baby,"I found this item to be very helpful in taking care of the baby. The multiple timers (plus alarms and flashing lights) help in keeping with the breastfeeding and diaper change schedules. Would love to see the following added to improve even more.Computer interface and/or SD card slot to export the when things were done.Diaper change button of some sort. For Wet, dirty, and DIRTY.A lanyard attachment would be nice as well.Would recommend to anyone having a baby for sure."
5,Awesome,This thing is pocket size with a clip in the back just in case you want to carry it around. The buttons and labels are a great size and easy to push. The light and backlighting are very bright. Very easy to use and highly recommened it for those who have a bad memory or are sleep deprived
1,"i found something better, this thing eats batteries","in my iphone, ipad, ipod and android , its called similac baby , and it has it all and it works for me and i dont have to keep up with a different device and is the best app for this and its free . hope this helps"
4,Works great - but watch out what you clip it to,"Works great - but watch out what you clip it to. Clipped it onto metal tray at hospital and clip broke. Still works well just realize that the belt clip is pretty flimsy. That said, this works wonders to help you keep track of time and get baby into a routine."
2,Easy to break the belt clip plastic,Haven't had a chance to use it with our babies yet because they haven't arrived yet. But within a few minutes of getting the product the clip on mechanism is already broken. The plastic that holds the metal clip in place is so flimsy it broke almost instantly. I barely put any pressure on it to open it and it snapped. I thought about returning it but doubted I would be using the clip anyway so I will just keep it as is. I will update my review once I have used the timer more. I gave it two stars due to the cheapness of that design.
5,Very handy,"Works great, handy, nice to have so many timers when you are juggling a baby. Easy to use and smaller than I thought which is great."
3,Could be better,"It's four separate timers that count up and can have an alarm go off at a set mark.. i.e. You can set an alarm to go off every 3 hours and have it count up to it and have four timers dong this. In reality, you need one timer for feeding reminders. The diaper change timer...why?. It would be great if the diaper part could add how many diapers of wet and BM through the day which is what the Dr asks for! Maybe n the future i'll time naps but for a newborn, I only need to keep track of feedings and how many diapers of wet and BM right now.I bought this for the timer function (to schedule feedings) so I can ditch my smart phone timer."
4,its ok,"It works well - does exactly what it is supposed to do. But honestly I found apps on my iphone that worked just as well and I always had my phone on me versus having to find this thing every time I fed or changed a diaper. If you don't have a phone with apps that can do this, this would be a great product."
1,Save your $$ and download an App to your phone,"I'm sure that this product works fine. I bought it thinking I would use it, but ended up returning. If you have a smart phone (and most everyone does anymore) there is an app you can download that tracks and handles the exact same thing. Try iBaby. And since you never go anywhere without your phone, it keeps you from juggling a million things when your hands are already full. Don't get me wrong, you'll need to track this info for the first couple of weeks, but after your little one starts peeing, pooping, and getting into a routine, you'll stop obsessing over tracking this stuff and won't use it anymore. Much nicer to remove a free app from your phone than have yet another thing to store, donate, or get rid of."
5,Works as advertised,"Works as advertised. Definitely makes dealing with the repetitive task of feeding. Essential if you're on a scheduled feedings instead of on demand. We were constantly forgetting the last time we fed our little man, especially at night. Would definitely recommend this little timer."
3,Didn't use as much as I thought I would,"This was great when I was timing my contractions, but wasn't as useful as I thought it would be once the baby came. I still ended up needing to keep paper records so I could tell the Dr. how many times the baby nursed a day and for how long. Also, it kept falling of my clipboard. It would be cool if it could keep some kind of stats..."
5,The Best Invention for a new mommy!,"As soon as I got home from the hospital, my husband and I have been using this. My son is now 6 months old, and I still use it. He is on a schedule, which is wonderful since I went back to work full time, and I pump at work for his milk intake. I need to know how much milk to send to whomever is watching him. When I was home, it would help me with how many minutes per breast.As for the battery, in the 6 months, I've changed it 2 times...I HIGHLY recommend this product. It made motherhood so much simpler..."
3,It's ok,"I really got this because a friend had one a briefly saw it and thought it would be great to track feeding, diaperchanges and sleeping times for my new born. Well it does that but on a very basic level. I does it for the most current time. I ended up getting an app for my phone that tracks all that stuff and more. It times the time on each side and saves all the information and can give you stats, like how many diapers a day and how many wet/poopy, and saves all the nap and feeding info so that you can start to get a feel for how often things are happening. Was great for about the first 6 weeks and now I don't even use the app any more as he has transitioned to a 3hr schedule and is predictiable. So I would suggest an app and not even bother with this."
3,"A good idea, but....","Buying this, especially after I read the reviews, sounded like a great idea. I thought I would use it and it would be so useful. BUT unless you are a super organized person who has a hard time keeping track of things, this is a waste of $20. I opened it to take to the hospital with me, but then I had to write everything down for the nurses so I didn't end up using this. When I got home, it stayed in my suitcase for 3 weeks while I recovered and adjusted with the new baby. 2 months later, it lays on the dresser in my infants room untouched since I unpacked it. I should've never opened it and took it back. My advice, think about if its actually something you can get in the habit of using before you buy it!"
3,A great idea but...,I have a 9 month old and went to see my BFF who had just had a baby. I spent a week with her and she was given this as a gift. We are both type A but with a new baby it's just hard to be type A. It's ok just to feed the baby. She only used the feeding time and the side switch features. She felt the rest were not needed. I could have used the side switcher when I 1st had my baby. But it ended up a few weeks later the babe had lost a few ounces and the Dr. said just to feed her when she was hungry not every 3 hours etc so she wasn't using it at all at that point. I do think it also had a light on it...that would be helpful. Probably an extra not a necessity.
3,So-so,"I saw this online when I was pregnant with my second child and I had to have it! The concept and idea of it was awesome and I still think so to a certain degree but not for the price. Quite honestly even after purchasing this item I still ended up going back to the old school way of pen to paper. It was just as quick to write down on a notepad the time I started nursing and stopped then to remember to press the button. If you are a super-techy person then purchase on, my friend! But if you aren't scared of a pencil and scratch pad spend this money on a box of diapers you definitely will need those!!!"
2,Waste of money,"This thing was ok while it worked, but it was a novelty and not a convenience. For starters, it was a pain to keep carrying around. When you are a frazzled mom, it's just one more thing to remember and to keep track of. I didn't like clipping it to my clothes because it would either fall off or I'd accidentally bump it and reset a timer. Then, during a middle-of-the-night feeding, I went to drop a bottle in some warm water to warm it up and forgot which hand had the bottle and which one had the timer. That was the end of the timer."
5,Soooo helpful!,"I got a lot of things at my baby shower but this was the most useful for a new born. You can set timers for diaper changes, naps, meals, etc so it takes the guess work out of when things when done, which my husband loved because he could just look at it and see what needs to be done when he came home from work. I breastfeed so the little switch at the bottom that keeps track of which side you used last was a life saver. I am a first time mom and had no idea how hetic things would be so this was a HUGE help."
5,Must Have Gadget,Agree with all the positive reviews. Would say take it to hospital with you. Loved the little flashlight function in addition to keeping track of everything important you will be to tired to remember!
4,very helpful,"I had this on my baby registry at Target but didn't recieve it so I bought it from Amazon (cheaper and free shipping). I use it everyday. So far the only timer I use it the feeding one. I check/change the diaper with every feeding, so I don't really need a timer to remind me to do it. I like that I can look at it and know how long ago I fed and how much longer til the next feeding. I always forget what side i am nursing on so it is helpful with that. Also the light is helpful at night. It's not too bright."
4,"Great item, but would pay more for a few added options","For the price, this is a great item for first time moms. An easy-to-use ""timer"" quickly shows you when you've last nursed, changed a diaper, napped, etc. Basically, it's a glorified set of four stop-watches, but a great item nonetheless. I would pay extra for a few additional features such as the ability to transfer data (nap times, feeding times, etc.) to a computer via a USB. It would also be nice to have a magnet on the back to stick on a fridge or metal door. Still a great product that I used often during the first few months of my sons life."
3,"Great, if you don't have a smart phone","I loved this when I first bought it ( one for each of my twins in different colors), and it is great for those few weeks when you're SO sleep deprived. BUT, I found an app on Android market that does all the same things PLUS it lets you track and chart feedings, weights, diapers, etc over time so you can see any sudden changes (really important for me with my low birth weight girls). And the app was free... So I could have saved some money, but I did end up using these still when my mother in law would baby sit, so I'd know what I missed without leaving my phone behind."
4,1st Time Parents,"I would recommend this product to any first time parents. The Itzbeen has been with my wife and I, wherever we go. It's the device that requires us to look for it before we leave the house, and usually it's in the diaper bag or on teh nightstand. Being first time parents, with busy lives, this allows to ensure our little one is getting all the attention she needs. I would even consider a product that experienced parents would like, let's face it, life doesn't and hasn't slown down in today's world, and we need all the gadgetry we can get to help us at times.I rated this a 4 star product, as I personally feel it could use an upgrade on the buttons a bit. Being a techno geek, I feel the slide switch for L/R should be a button instead of a switch, however I'll be honest, that's just the man's opinion, as I'm not the one using that switch, I stick with the Zzz, Feed, and Potty. (Sounds like me)Final Tip: Buy It!"
4,"The back of the click broke to fast,still good for timer:)",I like i recommended ease to used.but do not count on this 100% babies need more care and attention this is only if you tire.
5,helps keep track of contractions,Nice gadget for first time parents for the first two (stressful) weeks. It helped us keep track of contractions prior to birth. After that...mm. Soon you will trust your intuition and common sense: when the baby needs to be fed she will let you know. When a diaper change is due: you'll know too (diaper is wet/ heavy or full). Good luck with birth and caring fo your babies..hope all goes well.
4,"great product, just remember to use it!","great product! when you change, or feed, or anthing else you just tap a button and it logs the time. When wife yells over to me (happens all day long) ""hey hon what time did the baby eat?"" .. i have a quick answer!The only problem is remembering to use it."
5,Great gift for new moms!,"I saw the itzbeen while online shopping and ordered it based on its great reviews. It exceeded my expectations!! It is a wonderful idea and I wish I had one with my first son (I'm on #2 now). It is a great gift for new moms and for experienced moms because when you are sleep deprived and short on time, it so nice not to have to do math computing on hours slept, diaper change, et. Also, the ""bonus"" timer is great for me to use to keep track of my older son's last trip to the potty for toliet training. Also, EXCELLENT customer service which is so rare these days! BUY IT!"
2,Not the Greatest,"We did use this for the first couple of weeks until we got tired of replacing batteries every day. It goes through batteries WAY, WAY too fast. It does track useful things but, as other reviewers have mentioned, it only tracks when something happened the LAST time. It does not help you answer the pediatrician questions (how many times a day baby poops & pees, how often baby eats, how long baby sleeps). Either get an app for your phone OR do what we did and put a big white board in a central location in your home, divide into columns, and just make tally marks. Save your money!"
5,Itzbeen Baby Care Timer,"I love this little gadget! It serves it's purpose as advertised, and is so helpful in our sleep deprived household with our newborn and two toddlers. I brought it to the hospital with me when I had my son to keep track of feedings and diaper changes, and even one of my nurses thought it was just too cool. :)"
3,Great during the 1st 2 weeks!,"The Itzbeen is essential to keep up with the fog of the 1st 2 weeks after delivery. After that I think it is less essential to keep up with such detail the time between feedings and diaper changes. It is great for a breast feeding mom. I have used mine for the last 2 pregnancies. If you have a sick child or are having problems with weight gain, this also may be helpful."
3,Not really needed...,"I bought this gizmo three days into having our baby at home. I thought I needed this to keep track...turns out, although it's a cute, fun gadget, if I had waited a few more days I would soon have realized that paper and pencil (or, for the really technology-keen ones, an iPod/iPhone) serves exactly the same purpose and you don't buy yet another object that you'll soon be wondering what to do with..."
2,Good Idea - Several Design Flaws,"I was excited to receive my Itzbeen baby care timer at my baby shower. I had read the reviews and was convinced it would be very useful. Well, it is about as useful as 4 stopwatches. It does not carry any memory for previous entries so it does not replace a log like it says in the descripton. Also, my Itzbeen would lose all data once a day or so. I returned it to Amazon and am waiting for my refund for a defective product."
5,This is a lifesaver,This truly was a lifesaver for both of my children. For the simple fact alone that I could NEVER remember what side I had fed them on last!I was also really obsessive about how long they slept. So it was great for keeping track of that. This thing kept me sane in those early newborn days.
3,Brilliant concept; defective product,"A must-have for keeping track of baby's 'activities.' However, the item delivered to me was defective -- some of the numbers don't show properly (imagine a malfunctioning calculator). I emailed customer service and they promptly sent me a new one. Sadly, the replacement was of worse quality -- it only shows garbled characters. I emailed customer service again and they said they cannot send me another one as they cannot assure it will be properly functional. Instead they will just give me a refund. What a shame! I really want this product -- I am planning to just buy one at babies r us, that way exchange will be easier if I get another defective item."
4,Does what it says it does,"I bought this product for our first child to my wife and keep up with our babies schedule. The product does exactly what it claims to do and also is simple to use. I don't really have any negative comments for the product, only that we ended up not really using it that much. After a few days you figure out the routine and we didn't really need a reminder. Also they have the same type of device for the iPhone which might be more appropriate for some people (cheaper)."
4,"Useful, especially with a preemie, but overpriced","We had a preemie baby, and found that this timer was very useful when we had to make sure our daughter was fed every 2 hours, and that I let her try to nurse for 10 minutes, someone held her upright for 20 minutes after the supplemental feedings, and then I pumped for 20 minutes before crawling back into bed. That would have been a little too complicated on extremely limited sleep. The left/right switch helped too. The timers came in handy for the rest of the year as a pumping timer at work - one timer for the amount of time since the last session, and one for how long the pump was running. We used the night light often too.I subtracted a star for the price. It's a really simple device, so I don't see why it costs more than twenty dollars. We did find it on sale, at least."
1,Lame! I seriously never needed this...,"My advice is to wait a few days before purchasing this item, to see if you really need it.The quality of the product is just fine, but the functionality is pointless. I thought (prior to having my baby) that I would need reminding of how long it had been since he was changed, fed, put down for a nap, etc...which turned out to be completely not true. I never wonder if enough time had passed since feeding or changing or napping--it doesn't matter how much time has passed when your baby lets you know he is wet or hungry or sleepy! Like many extraneous baby items that I purchased because I was so excited about my impending arrival, this item got zero usage."
3,Not what we needed,"I heard from moms (and on here) just HOW MUCH a new mom needed this. So I bought it. We used it maybe 2 days. For me, its difficult to use and reset first of all (you have to hold down the timer until it blinks OFF for it to stop - otherwise it just resets and keeps on counting). In addition, most pediatricians want you to track a lot of info during these first weeks/months. I'm the type who wants more data - I want to know how much my LO ate (or how long if BFing), how often, and whether the diapers were wet/dirty. It doesn't store or track any of this info. Hubby and I just bought a cheap dry erase board and put up columns for what time we fed, how much LO ate, and diaper contents. We track 24 hours at a time, then total up the oz eaten and put that off to the side in a small weekly chart, erase the current day and start over. Very low tech but shows everything we need at a glance. And for a lot less price-wise."
5,Absolute must have!,"When I told my wife that I wanted this little device, she balked. She figured I was just adding another non-essential item to my gadget lust. When the baby finally arrived, I was vindicated.We trade-off staying up with the baby. I take the late evening shift (9pm - 2am) and she takes the early morning (2am - 9am). It's a little like two ships passing in the night. We're groggy at 2am, and we don't have the energy or mental stamina to discuss the status of the baby. With the Itzbeen, itz simple! I just hand her the little device and she knows when his last diaper was, when he ate, and how long he's been asleep (if he is in fact asleep).This will be our standard baby shower gift from now on. Every new parent should have one, but I don't know how many think to buy it."
4,"a must have, ESPECIALLY 4 1st time parents!!","i read the negative reviews on this item & really dont understand them. this is a great product! we use it mainly to see how long itzbeen since his last feeding & the last button u can use 4 watever. we really dont need the nap button or the diaper change because u will just no wen 2 change ur kid. this is y i didnt give this item a five. they could also add a lil more to it, but it is still a genius idea & works very well!"
1,Hunk of Junk,It never worked correctly for my daughter & son in law. They tried several times to figure it out... way too complicated for a timer.
2,You don't need this,"My brother thoughtfully got us this timer, but honestly we've never had much reason to use it."
5,Got it for our second child.... LOVE IT!,"If we had had this device when we had our first child a lot of the stress we felt as new parents would have been avoided....The simplicity of the device is its best asset. We have it clipped to the crib and use it to track feedings, diaper changes, the last time I took my pain medications and to keep track of which was the last breast the baby nursed from.... I can see how some people can find it useless if they are not as apprehensive as we are or they want to have all the information in a kind of log but for us this is the right amount of information in the best format we can think of...Soledad and Ernesto"
5,Great tool for new moms!,I lived and breathed by this for the first 2 months! Perfect for breast feeding moms especially when it seems like every feeding is running into the next. The nightlight is a great feautre too that we are still using routinely and my son is 3 1/2 months now.
4,Lifesaver,"I was suggested the Itzbeen by a friend and initially thought I could just use a watch to keep track of his eating and sleeping primarily. I realized quickly after becoming fatigued that I wasn't able to remember what happened when...things were blurring together. The Itzbeen has been a great help, especially when you are switching care providers during the day--everyone is able to see when he should eat and sleep without having to be familiar with his cues. The only thing I don't like is sometimes I will reset one of the buttons when he starts a feed or nap and it doesn't go as planned, so I wish I could set it back to what it had been on instead of it starting over. Very helpful little tool! I'll be getting one of these for all my pregnant friends!"
4,works great,"This product works great. we used it mainly for timing feedings, not much else.I've also created a free online feeding timer here:[..]"
1,No necesitamos esto!,"Lo usé 1 semana y despues me olvide que existía. Es una esclavitud estar checando los horarios, tienes que tener una vida!!! No lo recomiendo para nada."
4,A must have,"I love it and use it all the time to plan my baby feeding and diaper time.. When he cries, just by checking when was the last time he ate or changed disappear, I can tell what he needs.."
2,Not necessary with an app on my phone,I thought I would use this and just had to have it. It might be good if you don't have an iphone with an app because I found it was good to keep track of things in the early months. The app I found for free on my phone worked even better though because it kept a log of what had been happening from day one.
2,The Pawn,"was an movie, I saw it on Cinemax a long time ago and was waiting for it to come back but it didn't so I bought it. I remember it being better than it was, but its still a decent movie, but the ending is not realistic."
1,"Don't buy it, it clicks after a week of use",I checked the reviews here to see if I was the only one who had theirs start clicking after the take back time expired. The clicking is periodic and pretty much ruins the sound quality. VERY DISAPPOINTING.
1,Too Bad ZERO Stars Isn't An Option,"All plastic, very poorly made, mine lasted a week before it started getting randomly ejected.On the positive side, when it works, it sounds fine. Plus, the ""cassette"" is held together with screws, and by opening it up, reseating everyting, and screwing it back together I got it to work again... for another WEEK. Then, time for a tune-up.This thing is basically junk. Now I'm looking to replace it. Unless you want endless frustration, look elsewhere."
1,Beware!!!,"Aware of some of the critical reviews, I decided to give it a try because the FM transmitters weren't working. When I put it in for the first time, by tape player started grinding, flipping back and forth. I couldn't get it to eject (or stop grinding for that matter for quite a while), and, in the process of pulling this thing out, broke my tape player. Should have known better. Stay away from this one."
1,Doesn't work!!!,"Actually, it was fine for a few weeks, then it slowly stopped working. The cassette is really cheaply made- which was shocking for a Monster product. This is a rip-off!"
1,"Kind of works, but completely useless","We bought this after using a cheaper cassette adapter. Complete waste of money. It worked ok for a week or two, and then the grinding/clicking began. It's so loud that it ruins the music. It get so annoying that I have to turn the ipod off. Stay away from this adapter."
1,ipod cassette adapter failed,"I purchased two auto ipod cassette adapters. One for myself and one for my wife. Shortly afterwards, they both failed. They wouldn't stay in the cassette deck. I bought two more, one from radio shack and one from circuit city. I've had no problem with either. My first dissapointment from a regular and otherwise happy customer"
1,Horrible product and a waste of money,"I needed to replace the old one that I had for over 6 years. I figured Monster would be good because of their reputation. I have a Monster HDMI cable and it works great. But this cassette adapter is horrible! The sound is ok...if I can get it to work. Constantly would jump from side A to B a few times then spit it out while my stereo read ""tape error"". If I could give 0 stars I would because this was a horrible product."
2,"Worked great, until....","Before I bought this, I had an FM modulator. There was just too much static and fussing with the modulator, so I found out about the cassette adapter. This adapter worked great, the sound was perfect. Only for about 5 months, then the sound started cutting out. I then looked at the wire, and there was a fray in the wire right where the adapter connects to the ipod. Now, I believe the thing is discontinued anyway, because it's not on Monster's website. Very disappointing. Would have got 5 stars, but the length of use dropped my opinion of it greatly."
1,Bad Product,"My roommate bought this cassette adapter under a year ago and it has stopped working for him - it just quit.I bought a monster cassette adapter 2 days ago and found the sound quality aweful. I could hardly hear the sound. I ended up returning it to Best Buy.Considering personal experience and the rest of the reviews about this product, I would stay away from buying it. Monster may be a great company with other products, but this product was a flop."
1,Not Worth the Money,"Fearing the problems with FM transmitter style adapters, I tried the Monster iCarPlay cassette adapter. The results were very disappointing. The mechanism is noisy and makes a discernable clicking sound, like a cheap cassette. The sound quality is very poor with low volume and distorted high end. Piano is particularly poor. I returned this item for Monster's programmable FM transmitter adapter/charger and was greatly pleased with it. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Monster Cable ICarPlay Cassette Adapter,"The sound quality of this is only good if you want to listen to your music loudly. The sound that the ""tape"" makes is very loud and annoying and you can't listen to the music at a reasonable volume without having it drowned out by the noise the tape makes."
1,Seemed like a good idea,"Unfortunately if you have a 2002 Chevy Monte Carlo this is not going to work. I stuck it in the tape deck but it just kept popping out with an error message. I don't know if you can find out if its compatible with your car but I would recommend checking before you buy this, it will save you a lot of trouble."
1,"So quiet, it didn't work at all","I lost my adapter that came from Walmart and was a generic brand. It worked perfect. This thing was expensive and it didn't work at all. I'd have to turn the volume on both the ipod and stereo all the way up and then I'd get some sign of life, not anything you'd want to listen to. It's worst than even the worst RF transmitter I've ever tried. Don't waste your money, believe the reviews."
1,Almost useless!,"What a disappointment! The ""cassette"" makes a lot of noise as it is ""turning"" while in use; it is so loud and has that horrible scraping plastic squeakiness, that it cannot be drowned out with music at any comfortable level. Even with the volume on my iPod set to maximum, I had to turn up the car stereo's volume almost to maximum just to hear the music at all, which does not make for happy eardrums (or nerves) when the car's stereo changes back to radio. I will just stick to burning some CDs of my favorite music for my car."
2,"""Error""","yes, I had the same problem as others. After using the cassette adaptor for a month or so, it would try to flip the cassette over to ""side b"" when I was making left turns. Interesting but really irritating. Then it began doing it all of the time & my car spit the cassette out wtih the messaage ""error."" They have said they will replace it --we'll see. I've given it a generous two stars because I really enjoyed playing my ipod in my car without worrying about radio interference as I've experienced with ipod radio transmitters. Maybe try the Sony...."
1,It Doesn't Work,"I bought the Monster adapter because the Monster name has such a good reputation. I use the adapter with an iPod Shuffle and at first it worked great. Then, after a few days, my Lexus tape deck started ejecting the adapter once a day. Then it started ejecting it more frequently. I gave up on it today after it was ejected four times in ten minutes. I looked at the reviews to see if it was unique to me but I am experiencing the same problems everyone else is. I really expected better from Monster."
2,worse than a no-name 6-year old adapter,"Sound quality is worse than that of a cassette adapter bought at Walmart some years ago. Unfortunately, I snapped a cable on that one so I had to replace it to play with my 2nd gen iPod Mini. Monster Cable iCarPlay cassette adapter was the replacement. I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks in the car, not music, so I do not care too much about sound quality. Speech is legible and thus acceptable to me, although it is a noticeable downgrade as compared to my old unit.What is not acceptable, however, is that the 3.5 mm plug does not fit the iPod's input snugly. As a result, even the slightest jiggling of the cord causes iPod to pause as if the cord was unplugged. This never happened to my old adapter, neither it ever happens to the iPod headphones, meaning that the cassette adapter is indeed poorly designed."
1,Do not buy this item!,"It doesn't work. I tried this in a 1998 Jetta, a 2004 Civic and a 1999 Camry and it didn't work in any of them with my ipod. Shame on them for advertising that it works."
2,Buy from a store with a great return policy,"I tried it in three different car stereos. The ability to make it work depends on the features of your car stereo (has auto-reverse?, has a play button?, etc). Ultimately, I gave up because the noise of the plastic gears overwhelmed the excellent audio quality unless I turned the stereo up very loud. It may or may not work in your stereo, and you won't know until you try. So make sure you buy it from a store with an excellent return policy."
1,Didn't Work At All,"I also own a 2003 Infiniti G35 with a Bose Audio System. The cassette adaptor did NOT work in my car. After inserting the cassette adaptor, the tape deck would begin jumping back and forth from Side A to Side B. Finally, it would pop the adaptor out and give the following message: ""Tape Err"". So, if you buy this, be prepared to return it."
1,Noisy and didn't work at all,"I too have paid extra money for the quality of monster cables and surge protectors and was expecting the best. What a bummer!This thing just kept whirring and clicking noisily, and I never could get it to play any music. I tried several sources (CD player, mp3 player and IPOD) and tried to play it in three car cassette players ranging in age from 10 years to 1 day - as well as a boombox player.It did not work at all. It is not worth replacing, as the gears make so much noise even without music that I couldn't tolerate it for more than one or two minutes anyway. A loser, Monster!"
1,Bad bad bad,"The thing still works after a month, but makes horrible mechanical rattling noises as it plays. So bad, I was moved to write my first amazon review in order to chime in."
1,Pure garbage,"Broke after 3 days. I got this for a road trip so I threw out the packaging, assuming Monster products were high quality -- they aren't. Get the Sony adapters -- works great for me."
4,Great device for the money,"The cassette adapter works like a charm, and is superior to any FM transmission device.I'm rather confused with some of the reviews as this works just fine in both our cars. One is a front-load and one is a side-load and no problems since we've owned it for about the last year. I recommend it."
2,Save your time & money,"After one day of use (not even the whole day, just like 20 minutes) the product wasn't working any more. My car was spitting the tape out. I've wasted so much time and gone through some humility trying to fix this!! I had to dig the garbage trying to find my receipt from the apple store. When I didn't, I had to call Monster and they said they'll replace it if I sent it to them(I had to pay the s&h of course). I've given up and came here to write a review for my terrible experiences. THEN I read that it works if I removed the rubber wheel inside. So I took it apart and did so and it works! It makes LOUD whirring noises but the music works so I'll be keeping this but if you're considering this item... don't waste your money & valuable time!"
5,iPod Adapter for Car,What a great idea for older vehicles! It works great and is inexpensive! No need to change out your current stereo.
1,BAD PRODUCT!!!,"I got my adapter yesterday. It took me a few seconds to find out that it does not work. Glad, I returned it. AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
5,Will Recommend,This product arrived on time and was in perfect condition. It has great sound quality. I would certainly recommend this type of product over a frequency transmitter. I had a little bit of trouble keeping the tape in my tape player...it kept spitting it out. But I was able to make it stay.
2,Not for us,The cassette was easy to use. We have an older luxury car with a decent sound system yet the kids jammed the disc player so we thought this would be a good alternative. The unfortunate part is we can hear the click every time the cassette goes around. Really distracts from any music. We ended up going with a Jawbone speaker... more expensive but really really versatile and sounds awesome.
2,Cassette is an older model,"This iPod adapter is an older model. One day after I received it, it began spitting out the tape frequently - so annoying! It's an issue with the amount of tape in the cassette, I think... Low quality for sure."
4,No problems here,"After reading some of the negative reviews here, I wondered whether I should return this before I even opened it and spend a little more on a better solution. I'm glad I didn't. Maybe the results vary with different cassette players, but with my VW Golf (2000), it works like a charm. I set the iPod volume at 3/4 as instructed, and had to adjust the bass on my stereo a bit, but I have no complaints about the sound quality at all.I only give it four stars because it does have a certain ""jury-rigged"" feel to it -- you've got dangling wire and have to find a convenient place for the iPod itself. But until I can buy a car with a built-in dock and scrollwheel in the steering wheel, this should work just fine."
1,defective,I bought this product while on vacation to pennsylvania. I put it in my car player and automatically it was ejected. My car claimed that the tape was broken. I called the support center and they told me that it was not compatible with my car. Forewarning if you have a Pontiac Grand Am with a Monsoon stereo this product will not work.
1,Pathetic sound.,"I also was suckered in by the Monster name. I have an older Sony adapter that I've used in the past with no problems but couldn't locate it right before a road-trip, so I bought this one also. This actually sounds substantially worse than my actual cassettes (even though they're all over 10 years old).The sound is hiss-filled, very poor signal-to-noise ratio.Stay well away."
1,Que porquería!,This is the most terrible selection and performance of tropical popular music I have ever heard in my life!
4,Nice and Warm,This union suit was a Christmas gift for my husband. He is an appraiser so he views property outdoors and he needed something to wear uner his clothing for a lttle extra warmth. This suit has apparently worked well. He has worn it on the last couple jobs with temps in the teens and twenties. Would recommend to others.
1,getting what you pay for...,This base appears to be a painted plaster base and not metal. The arms holding up the shade are approximately as thick hangar wire and soldered to the side of the socket for the bulb. Not impressed with the craftsmanship of units shipped.
2,Table lamp,I was extremely disappointed in the lamp. It is very small. The shade is plastic not glass. I did go back to the website and found it did not have measurements (height). I thought perhaps I had missed it but it wasn't there.
4,"broken but works okay, priced right",The lamp came broken. I glued back the plastic (not glass) and it works just fine. A good deal regardless.
4,just what I expected,"Lamps were exactly what I expected them to be - they are inexpensive, work just fine, and are attractive for the price. They will do just fine until I am able to spend more time shopping (and $$) for really good lamps."
3,too fake,"the plastic shade is only ok. mine isn't too straight, but it works in the space. don't know if I'd recommend it"
3,Could have been better,"While the overall performance of this entire work was spectacular, I felt that there were a few places that was just a little too studied. These spots had an uncharacteristic feel of being a bit mechanical and of lacking emotion; something that I found to be unusual for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus."
5,True to size and very comfy,"I got these in my normal size and they fit like a glove, though I have wide feet. They're incredibly comfortable, but I'm only just breaking them in and have no idea how they'll hold up over time. Just a note - the picture doesn't quite match the product. The outside is exactly as pictured, though the sole is white with Minntonka Moccasins stamped on it, like this: [...] Not enough of an issue to lower the star rating, but it would be nice if the picture was exact so people get what they're paying for."
1,knock offs,not at all pleased when i opened the box. They were suppose to be a gift for my younger sister but to her disappointed they were pretty much knock offs. i guess i should i looked closely at the product i was ordering.
1,No sole! No insole!,"When I got the shoes, I am so disappointed! There is no sole and no insole. Furthermore, making me more angry, shoebuy does not admit its fault, it insists the item is correct! Oh my God... Does anyone wear a pair of shoes without sole and insole??"
5,Women's Minnetonka Kilty Suede Moc Softsole,I was very happy with Shoebuy's service. The merchandise was shipped out and delivered in a timely manner. The moccasin was very comfortable.
1,Poorly described,"Not only did this Oven knob not fit my stove, it did not include a dial for the oven that worked. The dial included is for an oven knob that turns counter-clockwise. My oven's knob turns clockwise. So the temperature starts at ""500"" and goes to ""150"" on the dial instead of the other way around. They included a dial for the stove top that could be interchanged clockwise/counter-clockwise, but not for the oven. Disappointed in this cheaply made purchase."
1,"""Fits most models""--HA!",Not one of the five inserts included in with this knob came close to having openings large enough for my standard cheap apartment stove.
2,Not for gas oven,"Be careful, this product is for electric ranges not a gas one like mine. I should've checked first. The temperatures were all off--I almost burned a banana bread. I had to go to my local hardward store for the correct type of knob."
5,The Best Yet!!!,"This is the Best of Ellen Barrett! Every new dvd workout just keeps getting better. You feel graceful, energized, challenged, and focused. You don't feel wiped out at the end, but very relaxed and ready for the day. I highly recommend this video!!!"
5,Best EB DVD!,"I own almost every workout dvd Ellen Barrett has. This is my favorite. It's energizing and no one move is overdone. Her workouts are generally not difficult, but as a runner, I like to do her videos to supplement my cardio...they really do release tension. My favorite move in Grace + Gusto is the cat/cow. I don't know why but it has an amazing de-stressing effect!"
3,Grace + Gusto - Ellen Barrett Live,"I love all of Ellen Barrett's DVD's, but this one seems to malfunction. He freezes multiple times, I have to restart the DVD player over and over, and I have never been able to do the entire workout:( I guess I should reach out to Amazon for a replacement."
4,Very nice and not too overwhelming,"This workout has been great for my aging body and my attempt to get back into a workout regime. Not too overwhelming at all. You will feel some soreness in unusual places the first day after. It also helped me with some annoying back problems I was having. This is my second of Ellen Barretts workout videos and I have done the 2 she used to have on Fit TV. I like them. My favorite of the 4 is actually her ""Skinny Sculpt"" DVD. I have spent a lifetime working out spinning, and stepping and lifting really heavy wieghts in barbell classes. I've also recently done quite a bit of Zumba. I am actually finding that I'm getting more results with this because it is so different than other things I've done my whole life. Plus, I am a bigger gal that tends to bulk up even though several experts say that shouldn't happen. I think these programs are actually doing some minor reshaping of my bulky body!"
4,excellent,"Ronnie may say ""Everybody Jerk,"" but he is anything but. This is really nice, mid-1960s gutbucket dance music with raspy vocals. I am at various points reminded of Jr. Walker, and the Esquires. Great stuff and check out the price. It's a no brainer"
4,Pleasantly suprising,"I am a Windows network admin trying to learn more about Solaris, and this book suited me just fine. Maybe some of the presentation was too simple if you are a UNIX guru - but this book is definitely for admins new to Solaris. I'm really surprised by some of the reviews here about lack of content - I found each chapter well laid out and easy to read with examples."
1,Save you money,This book is very poorly written. The author jumps from subject to subject with no logic. He introduces examples with commands that are not defined and leaves it to the reader to decipher the intent. Subjects are introduced assuming that knowledge that you are looking for is understood.
1,NOT WORTH IT,This is my second book by this author and once again I'm thoroughly disappointed. The book did not go through a heavy technical fix-up and it's filled with errors and information that is just plain wrong. Find a different book. Don't get this one!
4,Maybe... A bit disjointed collection of many USEFUL topics,"I hesitate to write a review, since I haven't actually bot this book yet: I keep ALMOST buying it (about 6 times!), because it has several (even 5-10) chapters that aren't in any other Solaris book, but some look very sparse. So, it's far from a ""complete"" reference, but I suspect it has many ""little piles"" of info which would be well worth the price. (Comments from REAL users of THIS book?? Maybe someone will prompt me to finally move this to the top of my ""buy NOW"" priorities;-) )"
2,Crappy,What a waste of $40. This book was really basic and did not actually help me administer anything...don't buy it. You can't return the download either....total crap!
1,worst movie I have ever seen!!,I would consider myself a movie junkie>>>love love to watch movies. This has got to be the worst movie I have EVER seen.
2,sophistry,"An interesting piece but no more than an apologists attempt to reconcile two fields that have no common ground. Polkinghorne attemts to treat the metaphysical as though it had more substance or basis than the legends, myths and superstitions upon which it is based. The fact that he has some background grounded in science, unfortunately, lends unwarranted credence to his work. At some point the myth followers will have to accept that the universe as revealed by science is not compatible with their myths."
5,The Master shares his wisdom,"Every Destroyer fan needs a copy of this book so whenever you wonder what the Master of Sinanju would say under any given circumstance you can look it up. This book collects many of the wondrous sayings uttered by the Master of Sinanju in The Destroyer series of books also available at amazon.com. For that matter, everyone, Destroyer fan or not, needs this book to help you get through those trying times. This is definitely ""duck soup for the soul""."
3,book of quotes,i enjoy quotes as much as the first person but a whole book. seems a little overboard to me. maybe if i wasn't having problems with the kindle program expiring in the middle of the book i wouldn't be writing this the way i did
3,fantastic...if you can figure out directions,"this product line and accessories are fantastic. once put together it is very sturdy, and very customizable. the problem is that directions are bsolutely horrible!!! im a very handy person, so things like this come easily to me, but it took me two hours of trying to figure out the instructions i finally threw them in the trash and just looked at the picture on the box. the instructions are extremely vague, and mostly require you to look at diagrams. this is actually the second product i have purchased that i have had the exact same issue with! so if you can figure the installation...you'll be satisfied."
4,"great organization tool, may have purchase more accessories","Have used this for three closets 6ft to 7 1/2ft. Builder had provided only one shelf on the top. We found it easy to install, it may be a half day to 3/4 day project. May have to cut one of the hang track with a saw which is metal. Lowes cuts the shelfs for free. Depending on the amount of stuff you may put on the rack, you might want buy extra shelftracks for support. I used it in a office and had alot of craft stuff. Overall, a great diy project and a bit heavy."
3,Merchandise not exactly what's advertised,"ClosetMaid 289021 ShelfTrack 5-to-8 Foot Closet Organizer, WhiteI just received this merchandise. The packaging was banged up badly, thus I proceeded to check contents for missing parts and/or damage. Inside the merchandise was intact, I must admit. However the contents show a devil-may-care attitude about what's being shipped. The supposedly two #28266 40"" Hang tracks were wrapped in a separate plastic wrapper with a label that identified them as #23206 00, this inner package also contained two 30"" hang tracks---30"" IS NOT 40""!,one (not listed) 30"" standard and a 24"" closet rod.Update: I posted the above comment, Amazon read it and replied immediately.I contacted Closetmaid in Ocala and the company sent me a replacement for the correct parts in a couple of days.Overall I am quite satistifed with the purchase.Oh, the closet looks swell!"
2,I thoroughly boring book.,"I found this book to be very poorly written and utterly boring.Don't spend your money on this book, you will only be disappointed!"
1,"Contacts Corrode Quickly, DO NOT BUY","These cheap flashlights are a waste of money. Even if the work when they arrive, the contacts corrode quickly and they do not work for long. Just don't buy them."
3,Smith of Virginia,"The book was helpful in my genealogical research, but I was expecting more than just a list of names and dates. Gale Farlow"
4,Inspiring and interesting,"I haven't yet put any of the ideas into practice, but as an ""armchair"" builder so far I have really enjoyed this book. There are nice little stories mixed in, and a nice range of ideas."
2,Soho 4-PORT USB KVM,"I used this switch in a mixed environment with laptops and servers, Unix and Windows. I found the switch to be flakey, but usable. In particular, the switch looses ports when I reboot either laptops. If I remove the USB connector, then the problem does not occur. Once a port is lost, I had to disconnect all computers and power, then reconnect them 1 at a time to get the switch to recover. For the price, this is a bit unexpected.Additionally, this switch is advertized as being upgradable (including mention of procedures in provided manual and Belkin online support), but it is not.Since I already own it and have learned how to avoid its problems, I've kept the switch. However, I would not recommend this particular switch to any but the most patient users."
3,Good filming but faulty DVD,I found the acting and directing magnificent but I ordered two copies and both lock up at the same place. One has to go past that spot and rewind to it in order to view the rest of the story.
2,not a favorite,Was disappointed it this. I'm usually a fan of Charles Dickens but I could have went without watching this. I never did finish the movie.
5,Children of Caesar: The State of American Eduction,"Watch this dvd and be moved!! Voddie Baucham is an excellent speaker and will rock your world with his wisdom and insights. He is a homeschool dad who is passionate (to put it mildly) about the discipleship of his children. This video will challenge you if are a Christian and you've never thought about where God wants your children to attend school. If you already homeschool and disciple your own kids, buy it and lend it out to all those who will watch. Our children DO NOT belong to Caesar (the government) they belong to God. Someday we will have to give an account for how we've raised and educated them. Between 80-90% of ""Christian"" kids leave the faith they were raised with by the time they go to college. It's time we ask ourselves why. One clue, as Voddie says ""If you send your kids to Caesar for their education don't be surprised when they come back as Romans."" Get this dvd and be enormously blessed."
1,A work unfinished,This book appears to be a first draft. No pronuciation help. Does not show how use the words. It would be worth buying if the author finishes it.
4,"CRIKEY, if modern goth is so good, why isn't it bigger?","This album has 26 songs from the 90s... I was expecting mostly tacky pretencious 80s-impersonators (with which, personally, I have no problem: there's something pure about rock being tacky) but this album is SO much more. I was SO impressed at the level of production in most of these songs. They are complex, and often blend intelligent techno with dark melodious Goth. Case in point: The 3rd song, Sound of Angels, by Element, and Waves of Sorrow.... brilliant sweeping landscape songs... there is some gratuitous classic goth on this album (Alien Sex Fiend; Painted Glass) but it's mostly unique and profound. Surprising! There WILL be a resurgence of Goth in the new millenium, you mark my words...! Some of these bands will have their hay-day yet..."
4,Love it!,Great set with plenty of music to choose from including the essentials. Bonus mystery Cd was awesome too! Great price for a 3 disc set!
5,A worthy successor to the Riga !,"I bought it on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt for my wife, over her objections that she would never use it. Within a week I had to buy another memory card ! It's very easy to use - almost ""intuitive"" in that things do what you expect them to do, and fully lives up to all the expectations created in the product blurb.Pros - in addition to all the advertised goodies, the battery is a standard phone battery, so you can get spares and recharge them in advance using a phone charger !Cons - if you're taking stills in lowish light, get some practice at standing still before hitting the shutter button !"
5,great scent,As usual this made a great gift. My wife thoroughly enjoys this great perfume. Will probably order more next year.
1,disatisfied with vendor,"product came in a cardboard box with packing peanuts, there wasn't any box from manufacturer... very strange! seems to be perfume in bottle!"
5,A Must Have for any Designer of Anything.,Great cultural perspective of graphic design. Showing a true pioneer whose not gotten much credit until now. Just when you thought all those cool firms with funny names pioneered everything you finally find where they got their ideas. Touché to Mr. Chantry. And touché to those before him even lesser known than he who he owes it all too.
5,"Witty, winning, winsome","A beautifully designed and engagingly written volume, it arrests the eye and startles the mind into thought. One learns a great deal, easily and gracefully, from the prose that works without distracting attention from the magnificent images."
2,New translation is just horrible...,"Karlsson-on-the-Roof by Astrid Lindgren, translated by Sarah Death is plain bad and boring. It was my favorite book, when I was little. I red my book to my kids in Russian and they loved it!!! They never enjoyed the new edition at all!!! How sad, that bad translation killed the most wonderful book on Earth.I can suggest to read the ""Emil "" books, much better translation by Lilian Seaton and much better illustrations."
2,"Nice Coffee Table book, but no real information","Compared to the wealth of books on the subject in German and Japanese, there has yet to be a single good book in English. This book has nice pictures, but it doesn't even attempt to touch on the detail required to fully understand this subject adequately to qualify people to specify and actually implement Green Roofs. [...]."
5,The best advert for green roofs yet?,"A well researched book of worldwide, high profile green roof case studies, with contributions from many of the leading people in the field. It is nicely laid out with great pictures and text explanation of inspiring examples of green roofs. It shows just what can be done with roof space. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject area."
3,"Kind of flimsy, but worked",This arrived a little bent and seems a little flimsy. But it works for the purpose I need it to... to organize mail and junk on my counter.
1,Some items just shouldn't be shipped,Arrived dented and creased. The are flimsy enough that one big ding on the outside packaging was all it took to smash both files.
4,A worthwhile compilation,"This is a good compilation overall, with some really good tracks for sound demos. As always Telarc produces some of the best recordings."
2,Wrinkle-free? No.,It does soften the dark circles but has not stopped the wrinkles. I'm on my third tube. A little goes a long way.
1,Irritating Eye Cream,"Really like La Roche Posay products; however, this product is apparently an exception. Although advertised for sensitive eyes, product caused extreme puffiness and irritation around the eye area. Another added 'feature' was the large yellow rings that would form around my eyes mid-way through the day. Could have been an allergic reaction or bad product; nonetheless, please be aware that this product may not be as sensitive for the eye area as advertised. I will say that the tube it comes in is very convenient and dispenses just the right amount of product in a sanitary way. Wish it would have worked out..."
3,Good Moisterizer,"After using this product for several weeks, I really haven't noticed any reduction in wrinkles, but I will add that it is a very good moisterizer."
3,la roche - posay vit c eye cream,I love this product and have been using it for years. Normally I buy it from La Roche but saw I could get it cheaper somewhere else. It arrived within a few days which was great. The problem is that it expires in 1 year. It usually takes me 2-3 years to get through 1 tube so it turns out I actually wasted money buying from this seller.
1,Huge,I was expecting a cup size. Filter this is for making five gallons of tea. Good to use for fish .
5,handy dandy,didn't think about how i would steep 1 cup of tea leaves--happy it was reccomended for this tea produce.
3,Tea strainer.,Thios was inexpensive and I can tell. Tea leaks out when I have it in water even though I have it tied off.
4,good value...,"UPDATE: does not stain as bad as I thought it would.. after steeping thai tea leaves, I just rinsed with warm water and the color mostly washed away.I got this to make thai iced tea.. works fine, the tea leaves don't go through the cloth while steeping.If you're crafty, I think you can make this yourself. the handle is just made from coiled aluminum wire.. Just get some muslin cloth, sew it and put it on a wire.. Then you can add a drawstring so you can take it off for cleaning and make it any size you want! :) Tea stains and the cloth is white.. this cloth is not exactly removable, you have to cut it off if you want to take it off to clean. But then you would have to sew it back on.. or buy a new one..BUT if you're like me and would just rather buy it then make it.. then get this :) it does what it's supposed to and is a good price. Also there are a lot of homemade recipes for thai tea if you want to avoid the food coloring.BOTTOM LINE: I'm happy with this purchase"
3,Great for a short time,"It serves it's purpose. I suppose it's not intended for prolonged use. After a few weeks the metal began to rust and I had to throw it out. Good for short time use, not intended to be permanent."
3,One or Two Use Item,"These are great for straining tea and coffee (like Indian tea and coffee). The handle is a unpolished metal that looks like it just came out of a hardware store and the filter is just muslin fabric which works great for straining.Other than the fabric being a great staining tool, the rest of this is pure junk and not nice looking at all. I will use it and it will be useful for me, but I wouldn't use this for company. If you want a longer lasting better looking strainer use the muslin stainless steel type, you can get it here on Amazon. I don't regret my purchase since shipping was free, but the item is nothing special at all it just works well.If your planning on entertaining, go with something nicer, if it is just for function this will do.Cheers and Vidimo Se!"
3,does the intended job.,"i ordered this filter to make thai tea, and it works great. the handle is short, so you have to be extra careful when pouring something hot. i should have bought a slightly more expensive one with a thicker handle. the only negative thing is the handle. everything else is great."
5,This product is HANDY!,"This is a SUPER handy product for making LOTS of tea for people~ I love it! It does stain after a few uses, but I always hand wash it with a mild detergent and let it dry. Great investment if you make lots of iced/loose leaf tea!"
5,Good strings,"Good strings. Improved the sound of my acoustic guitar immediately. Needed a lot of ""streatching"" but is starting to stay in-tune for longer periods now."
2,They don't have stops on the ends,I can't tight the string to my guitar because they don't have ends and it's a pain in the butt trying to make knots. I am still dealing with the problem
4,nice one for such a cheap price...,The product arrived promptly. The sound of the string is not very GREAT but it was good enough. For such a cheap price i would consider this product worth buying.
4,nylon strings,"Found an old cheap guitar at in-laws' house, and put these strings on it.I was having trouble teaching my kids to play guitar because the steel stringshurt their fingers.Put these ""student"" level nylons on the cheap guitar, and my son plays it all the time now.It took a few days of re-tuning before the guitar would hold a tune,but i suspect that may be true of most nylon strings.Definitely a good purchase."
1,Did not receive the product.,"I bought a set of classical (nylon) guitar strings a couple of months ago. They were labeled as ""student"" strings. I received them promptly, and they were so good that I ordered another set over a month ago, but they never arrived. So, I can't rate them. But the service actually gets no stars. They kept my money! (1 cent!)"
1,Frustrating,Strings do not have stops on the ends which makes them impossible to tune. I had to manually tie knots on the ends of every string then when I went to tighten them they would just pop loose. After 10 tries I gave up.
3,It was ok,"I think this book is outdated an even though i read through some of it before purchasing it its not what I thought it would be, therfore I gave it to my mom. She has found a few things in it she hadn't made in a very long time."
5,Awesome,I liove it!!! It is truly authentic I have been looking for a real down home recipe cookbook that takes you back to your ancestors
5,Fantastic Cookbook!,"I have cooked these recipes over and over again. Delicious and easy recipes to make. The bbq chicken and strawberry pie are just a couple of my favorites. I have become famous for my ""best ever"" carrot cake with pineapple cream cheese frosting! The moment I saw this on Kindle, I had to buy it. Absolutely worth the $9.99 and more."
3,The old and the new,I have the other two books in this series. These books offer some historical background on the recipes. I like them more for the historical value than I do the recipes. Love the pictures. I wish there was historic info behind all of the recipes. I will admit that I live and die by Tillery's recipe for the filling in lemon meringue pie -- best I've ever tasted.Beware when authors review their own books.
5,Southern treasure...,"A friend recommended this cookbook to me when I mentioned that I wanted to find a good, southern cookbook. And it is! It is beautifully illustrated and the history along with the recipes make it a truly historical cookbook. I haven't tried the recipes yet, I'm still enjoying the reading!"
5,Wonderful! All of the recipes I've tried are delicious!,I really enjoy cooking from this book. The recipes are easy to follow and the historical tidbits in between are very interesting. I've recommended this cookbook to my dad and he loves it as well.
2,"Sorry, but this movie let me down","""The Patriot"" is Mel Gibson's attempt to return to his ""Braveheart"" glory, and unfortunately he fails. This movie really caught my interest for the first twenty minutes, and then really started to drag on. By the time it was to a scene where Gibson was hiding his family out in a some coastal town, I was considering getting up and doing something else. The acting is good and so is the scenery, but British atrocities are grossly exaggerated, and there is little emphasis on the actual war. The whole movie's basically a revenge plot, the villain's so evil that it's hard to believe that there was a British leader like that, and did I mention that the movie's almost two hours too long? Plot and emotion are good, but ""The Patriot"" way overdoes it. I finally resumed interest in the final battle scene, which is impressive. If only the whole movie had been as good as the beginning and the end. If you want a Gibson war movie, watch ""Braveheart"". 2 1/2 Stars"
2,How much does pointless cost nowadays?,"This is the sloppiest excuse for epic filmmaking that I've seen. Truthfully I'm not bothered by the inaccuracies of films like this or U-571. They're 'based' on things, not anything else. I recognize the need for consolidation and composite characters to keep things flowing dramatically. However that's where i thought this movie failed horribly. It didn't keep things moving. It moved from set piece to set piece without once being interesting to me or provocative. Heath Ledger was horribly ineffective, especially after hearing all the buzz on his breakout performance. His romantic scenes were forced and misplaced, only serving to set us up for a tragic event later in the film. Again, I'm all for foreshadowing, but how about a little ambiguity, huh? I just kept wondering how they could have spent a reported ($) million on this shoddy, poorly photographed and horrifically uneffective film. Far and away my least favorite Mel Gibson film since Air America."
4,"A good rendition of an old, tired theme","Yes, this is the typical, worn out action movie theme: Retired vicious war hero has nice family, own house, lives peaceful life. Mean bad-guy type shows up and (pick one) kills wife / kills girlfriend / kills dog / blows up house / blows up truck / kidnaps child / doublecrosses / all of the above. Retired vicious war hero comes out of retirement and Gits 'Em. This describes about 95% of the movies in the ""Action"" section of any rental store.The good news is just because a formula is overused doesn't mean it can't be done better, and this movie does it well. It's also nice that it's set in the time of the American Revolution, which is quite rare for movies.So, very good movie, just an old, tired theme. I considered it to be worth a purchase."
5,Great transfer!,"They did a great job transferring this to Blu-ray. It was dazzling in detail. It was all that I hoped for, in an older title that has be re-released."
4,"Overall a good movie, but too bloody","Overall I thought this was an excellent movie with one exception - Gibson just goes overboard with the blood in a few places. I guess he was trying to show that war was bloody even back during the American Revolution, but I think the point could have been made less graphic. However, this is a good, patriotic movie that has some historical basis in American history. Highly recommended for adults, but may be too bloody for kids."
4,Andrews review for comm arts,"This movie is based in the New England colonies of America during the Revolutionary war. Mel Gibson does a fantastic job of portraying true partiotism. At the start of the movie he is somewhat reluctant to be active in the war, but once it comes closer to home he becomes a large part of an unorganized militia. Mel Gibson attempts to portray a sense of patriotism with a cause through his acting.Throughout the movie Mel fights against the British and fights for home and freedom from the tyrranical grip of the British. He does a great job of showing what life was like during that time period and wonderfully attempts to instill a sense of freedom in all viewers.ALthough this movie may not be completely historically correct it does what it was made to do, Entertain. This movie was entertaing and completely worth while, Mel Gibson does a great job writing directing and starring in this movie and does so with pride and enthusiasm."
3,History buffs might enjoy this the most,"I think this movie was the victim of great expectations, coming on the heels of Braveheart, which audiences and critics alike hailed as a masterpiece. This Revolutionary War saga is amazingly similar to Braveheart, in that a peace loving but fiercely able Gibson is forced from a pastoral life by malevolent political forces. The movie is not without highlights, notably Gibson and his two young sons taking on a handful of British soldiers, but the payoffs are ho-hum. It's not that the movie is bad, just that it's predictably exactly what a solidly-done Hollywood period piece about the Revolutionary War would look like."
2,Pretty Bad,"I was drawn in by the commercials, but in the end, it was just a really long movie with too many main characters. Mel Gibson plays a reluctant soldier tormented by the war and his cliched lines. The relationships are trite; watch out for the son's love interest. The only surprises the movie has in store for viewers is the death of nearly every main character. The movie lacks closure. Pluses: a good villain, nice setting and adequate effects. If you want some Mel Gibson, see Chicken Run instead!"
1,Funniest Movie of the Year,"Mel Gibson is a peaceful plantation-owning father who wants nothing more than to make a nice rocking chair for himself, from which he can (presumably) sit on the porch, pat his yung'uns on the head and command his slaves with wise benevolence. Then one day a merciless Redcoat slaughters most of Mel Gibson's family. Silly limey! Didn't he see Mad Max, Lethal Weapon, Braveheart, Ransom, Payback, etc.? Doesn't he know Gibson is hiding a violent past, and is just going to come after him in a bloodthirsty rage, mowing down scores of dimwitted Brits with his trusty tomahawk (in some of the most incredulous action sequences in Gibson's career--all that's missing is the dislocated shoulder gimmick from ""LW"")? Gibson has never looked more jive than he does in this pretentious vigilante's tale; he has played this character one too many times, and anyone who appreciates American history at all ought to be offended by the crass misuse it gets at Emmerich's hands."
1,Forgivaaniss Pleesss.....,"This film is terrible....The FilmThe Acting was Poor We are talking Charles Bronson in Death Wishh 3 standard here.Especially that ... little boy!The Battle scenes were good except for when Mel was killing people with the American flag,that part was sickening.... The music was below average and SHOULD have been better.Overall it was a pretty bad film.I think the way they handled the Slavery issue was bad,even for Hollywood standards ... according to this film the British are the bad guys when it comes to slavery.I'd like to end it with this question.What happened to all the Scottish soldiers that fought for the Briish army in the war of 1776???"
4,PATRIOTISM....pass or fail?,"This year i have seen many good movies, I really liked this movie though i wouldn't consider it as good as Mel Gibsons previous movie braveheart. I left this movie with a feeling of patriotism which definatly shows that this movie not only accomplished its goal but superimposed feelings in my heart. I give it 4 out of 5. Excellent movie. Well worth buying."
3,Not Quite Braveheart,"The movie was pretty good. The action was intense and at some points it reminded me of Braveheart. What surprised me the most was the humor in the movie. It was actually pretty good, but I think they've overdone it. But my main qualm with The Patriot is that #1: It wasn't long enought to be an epic, and #2: It just didn't have the same feel as Braveheart. The music and the scenery didn't feel too majestic. It did do well as an Action movie though. If you want to see a good colonial movie, watch Last of the Mohicans. If you want to see a good movie about revolution, watch Gladiator."
2,Fatal Tragedy,"When i have seen the teaser i said ""wow another Braveheart kinda movie"". Than i ve seen the trailer and i said ""i gotta see that one it will be a classic"". Than the movie hit the theaters and i t was a total disaster. A major earthquake. All my expectations were in vain. first thirty minutes were perfect than came the troblesome scenes, like ""I'll join the army"" everyone getting up in that church; it was an awfull wiev. The scene the priest dies and throws his shotgun. Those scenes were like a directoral debut of a new graduate. Horrible... I rated two stars because i have a great amount of respect to Gibson and Emmerich's old works (excluding Godzilla). Be alert! Dont see that one... If you are a big American History fan that could be an excuse to see that one."
1,Propaganda - Plain and Simple,"This film is absolutely ludicrous. It is a shocking and unabashed revision of American history, an indefensible white-wash of the revolutionary period, and an unequivocal insult to the British (not to mention all independent thinking Americans).For the love of God, people, think about what you're watching!"
4,One great war movie on the American Revolution,"I really don't have much to say except only what you're going to read from all the other reviews of non-thinkers. So I'll say that and a lot more. The fact is that it was a great war movie, besides that fact it was on the American Revolution. Not all war movies coming out today are on that subject, more on the WWII, and Vietnam. Mel Gibson made his usual appearance and did a good job as usual. At the beginning it was pretty much the same as his Brave Heart appearance. At first he was kind and loving and loved his family. After things went bad and the red coats started ""messing"" with him and his family he started to get infuriated. The killing of the one red coat towards the beginning of the movie that his two youngest sons had to witness was aspecially cruel. The point is that he had some memories of obvious wars in his past."
4,Mixed Emotions About the Patriot,"I have mixed emotions about the Patriot because on the one hand people like Jessie Jackson would not appreciate what our founding fathers did for all of us. It is filmed in south carolina where there is some prejudice so some people probably have the wrong attitude. On the other hand there is al lot of history for us to learn and people like Benjamin Frnaklin and George Washington and veterans of wars would like it more. This is their people who were figghting and the real Americans are shown coming to the defense of their country. If you can not appreciate the red white and blue, well then maybe this movie is not for you. If you like action and history then you will like it if you are a true Patriot and not a rebel without a cause."
1,When does lack of historical accuracy become a lie?,"This film distorts history so much that it verges on being sinister. How or why a slave owning turncoat was turned in to a hero is beyond me... I know ""it's only a movie""; except this sort of film does colour peoples perception of history over time. There is some cinematic quality to this film so my one star may seem harsh but I feel strongly that hollywood is re-writing history bit by bit."
1,I love America!!!,"Sweet! This movie tells it as it was. No one owned slaves, the movie said that they worked the land freely. Sweet! Now I don't feel bad for black people anymore! And what about those British! They're so evil! No wonder Radiohead is so bad."
1,Sick and Gratuitous,"...in which a very demented British soldier leads a very demented British army to senselessly slaughter everyone that you are made to care about in this half sappily cliched, half grotesquly sadistic waste of time. The bad guy(s) here make Hitler and the Nazis seem like Josie and the Pussycats, as is usually the case in a film such as this, but the sickening slaughter goes so far past the point needed for a dramatic setup (i.e. bad guys bad enough that you want to see their comeuppence, which is just fine) that you start to question the motivation, even the sanity, of the film's creators. By the end, pretty much all that is left is Mel and a bunch of dead people, and this film seems to think that there's not a single thing wrong with that. Their mistake."
2,The Patriot...,...Wherein a German filmmaker by the name of Roland Emerich makes a movie where evil British Redcoats commit a vile atrocity against American freedom fighters... an atrocity that in reality was perpetrated by German troops against French villagers in WWII. Nice one Roland. What are you going to do next - make a film where the British gas 12 million people in Auschwitz before the plucky German freedom fighters come to the rescue?
3,Had high hopes but.....,"Was expecting a saving private ryan set in the 1770's what I got was cliche after cliche , inaccuracy after inaccuracy. To those who are knowledgable of this time period you'll see the holes soon into the picture.If you want an intelligent film about this time period, rent or buy I recommend buy Last of the mohicans(even thought that takes place in the French and Indian war) speaking of Indians they were completely left out of this picture to a group of people who ahd a pivotal role in the revolution I found it highly insulting.This movie does have some redeeming qualities the first battle I belive its supposed to be the battle of charleston is entertaining and fairly accurate. I give credit to an excellent role of General Cornwallis played by (Tom Wilkinson). Another note this picture did its best to villianize the British, which is wrong and extremely inaccurate the colonials were much more brutal than their british adversaries."
3,"Historically not accurate, but still entertaining","Let me break this down for you very simplistically.Do you like your war movies to be historically accurate? If yes, you will hate this movie.Do you like your war movies to be entertaining? If yes, you will enjoy this movie.It's really that simple."
4,"GREAT MOVIE, BUT NOT THE BEST OF GIBSON","YEA ANY HISTORY BUFF WOULD LOVE THIS ONE. GREAT MUSIC, GREAT BATTLE SEENS, AND BEST OF ALL, THE GREATEST NATION IN HISTORY IS BORN. THE MOVIE IS VERY FACTUAL AS YOU SEE DURING THESE YEARS BRITIAN WAS THE WORLD'S GREATEST POWER. NEVERTHELESS, HER YOKE WOULD BE CAST OFF AS THE USA BEGINS TO TAKE OVER.ITS A GREAT MOVIE, MEL, YOU DID I FINE JOB ON THIS ONE. BUT ITS NOT BETTER THEN BRAVEHEART, THE ALL TIME CLASSIC. YET IS WELL WORTH IT, A WELL EARNED 4, JUST BEHIND BRAVEHEART 5, AND PASSION OF THE CHRIST 5.GOOD JOB MEL"
1,Most Disappointing,"This movie could not have been any more of a let down. I was hoping for a great movie that had some grounding in fact & history. Something that would allow you to imagine what it was like to live in those times and understand the challenges of the day. I was hoping for a movie that gave me insight into a time & place I've not known.Instead I got a really bad action movie set in our country's early times. The characters and situations are unbelievable. The acting is bad. The script is bad. The dialogue is bad. The plot is bad. I found nothing redeemable about this flick. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't waste your time or money..."
3,Ok,"The movie came really fast and it looks like normal wear and tear. But unfortunally when watch the movie, there was a scratch that made me skip a big chunk of the movie."
1,Throw your history book out the window kids!,"...Revisionist history is pretty hard to stomach especially when it's disguised as supposedly high entertainment for the educationally oppressed. THere are some very glaring mistakes:1. Slavery is non-existant! ... At least not on Mel Gibson's plantation. When his 'slaves' are set free by the British, one says, ""No sir, we're not slaves...2. Mel Gibson's character brandishes a Cherokee hatchet because he's a supposesed vertren of the French-Indian war of the 'Last of The Mohicans' fame...3. The acting is tragically bad..."
2,Terrible film.... But......,"This movie was lousy. Sure, Hollywood has re-written history. Inaccuries are abundant in this flick. But it also appears that reviews made on here by Britons want to bitterly justify what their own ancestors in this bit of British history did to keep control of the thirteen colonies. FACT: King George III was a stubborn (and rather psychotic) tyrant who unmercifully taxed his subjects in America without any representation. FACT: The Continental Congress avoided war up until it was inevitable that the mother country was unwilling to negotiate and give the colonies certain rights and freedoms. FACT: Britain financially profited tremendously off of the American Colonies through the slave trade from Africa to the Caribbean and then onto North America.I could ramble on and on.... but the FACT remains.... Britain LOST the war! So get over it!"
5,"Great movie, impeccably accurate!","Not a detail in this movie is inaccurate! what are you talking about?! There have been a few one-star reviews stating that this is ""revisionist history."" There is, however, not one concrete example that I could find! This movie is quite violent, but I do not see any inaccuracies whatsoever!"
3,Pretty good,"Good movie...but the unstoppable Mel Gibson thing gets a little old. Enertaining, good action."
5,Stirring,"I do not have a single favorite movie, there are far too many wonderful movies out there, but if I did this very well may be it. The costumes are excellent. They are done beautifully and, according to the bonus materials, with a high value placed on authenticity. The movie is shot in picturesque locales and with great camera work. If you didn't see this movie on the big screen then you missed out.Probably the best part of the movie though is the wonderful dynamic between Heath Ledger and Mel Gibson. The two work very well together. There are many good performances to compliment those two, in fact there is not a weak link in the movie. A must see moment is when Gibson's youngest daughter talks to her father the first time. I am an unemotional person, but that scene made me cry. In fact I got teary-eyed several times in this movie. The only time that has ever happened in my life."
2,Hollywood sells itself for cheap thrills.,"I find it hard to believe that after something like Titanic, with it's false facts and added glitz of a gunman who never existed, that ""The Patriot"" could even attempt to do the same thing. The British have never rounded up people and herded them into churches and then set them alight, a fact even american history admits. And to make out the lead character to be whiter than white when even in american history he was not even close to that degrades the good acting and great cinematography that the film obviously has. I think you have to look past cinematic licence of fiction when you're dealing with things that actually occured and are well documented, it's a shame the director and writers didn't agree."
4,Patriot,A beautifully photographed and well written historical drama based loosely on the revolutionary war hero THE GRAY GHOST. Mel Gibson shows why he is one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood today. Displaying a range of emotions from comedy to tear invoking drama this movie will take you up and down the scale of human emotion.
4,"Formula plot, but well played and acted.","The plot of PATRIOT follows the formula of the reluctant warrior who is forced to fight by circumstances--see SHENANDOAH and others. True to the formula, once he enters the war, he is unstoppable. Even though it is strictly a formula plot, Mel Gibson and an excellent cast pull it off. Heath Ledger is excellent as the son who must fight despite his father's warning, and Jason Isaacs is wonderfully mean as the brutal British officer."
3,hilariously funny film in a way.,"Although the film was fairly good in parts, i found it predictable and corny. ' she is the north star' is now a joke between me and my friends. Was it not painstakingly obvious that mel gibson was going to find the north star choker among the ashes? However i did like the scene where mel tricks the brits with the soldiers in the field and leaves with the dogs. It's worth watching for the bad diologue alone, but some people will find it exciting and a moving film. Therefore it can be loved by all!"
2,Hollywooden,"The Patriot is pretty much your typical Hollywood blockheader. Cardboard characterizations and a formulaic script overwhelm the excellent cinematography and glimmers of good acting. I was put off by the distasteful villainization of the British, who in truth, acquitted themselves quite honorably in their conduct of the war; and of Lord Cornwallis, who was a decent man and general. In this movie, Hollywood once again shows its odd understanding of how warfare is really conducted. In warfare one wants the HIGH ground! Not to mention the foolishness of shooting your enemy from a circle!!! However, the most lamentable fault of The Patriot is it's utter predictability. I continually annoyed the people I was watching it with by telling them what would happen next.... Rent this movie if you like Mel Gibson, you won't be disappointed."
2,Eh.,"Everyone should see this movie... once. Its merits include: Heath Ledger showing good growth as an actor; Jason Isaacs as a supremely oily villain; and Tom Wilkinson playing a fairly noble Cornwallis to balance Mel's overblown and flagrantly inhuman brutality. Unfortunately, these fine points aren't enough to deserve watching this film ever again. The film has, at best, a tenuous sense of dramatic tension. The filmmakers attempted to remedy this by periodically slaying major characters. At best ineffective; at worst insulting. At times it seems that Emmerich is peddling some kind of distorted British propaganda by painting American revolutionaries as savages bent on bloodshed and revenge. So rent it; watch it. Enjoy the three good points it has (Ledger, Isaacs, and Wilkinson). Then, when one of this film's unreasonably fanatical followers asks you with bright-eyed enthusiasm, ""Have you seen this?!"" you can nod, smile, and walk away."
5,Portal into history,"The first time I saw this movie was late on July 4th. It was an incredible experience. I had no idea what was sacraficed for our country to declare independence from the British, but this movie hit it home with an immersive story line, wonderful characters, and intense scenes.Whether you're a historian or a war-movie fan, you won't be disappointed with this one."
3,Not sure,"I have been trying to find out where the 11 minutes of extra footage comes in. It could be just one additional scene, or a few seconds added here or there. Either way, this really didn't seem like the movie that was crying out for a extended addition. We have already had the original release, then the superbit, and now this one. I guess next it may be the superbit extended version, then the HD/Blue Ray version. I hate when the studios double and triple dip. I would rent this one first to see if the extra 11 minutes are worth another purchase."
2,Over-hyped,"This film is shallowness itself.Take a measure of historical inaccuracy, add some banner waving, a touch of over-acting and mix well with a predictable story and script. Next add a villain who would not be out of place in a Victorian music hall skit, and finally a huge amount of sentiment - until it drips out the sides preferably. The result is a movie like this.It has nothing new to offer, nothing new to say.It's only redeeming feature is that it was nicely shot (which is what the makers should have been ;-) which is why is gets 2 stars.If you want originality, look elsewhere. If you want a film made to a formula that amounts to little more than eye-candy, this is for you."
2,It could have been much better,"You could sum this film up in five words. BRAVEHEART DOES THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. As a history buff and reenactor, the PATRIOT had it's moments, but it was overly long and inaccurate.At times it was silly and predictable. This film is a major improvement over earlier films that deal with the Revolution, but it still could have been better. Students of uniforms and period weaponry will notice quite a few inaccuracies. If you love Mel, go for it. If you love history, watch it at a friend's house, but don't waste your money."
4,The American Revolution in all its glory - and gory,This film wonderfully depicts the heartbreaking toll that war takes. No family is untouched. Mel Gibson has made a wonderful transition from heart throb to character actor. This film is full of wonderful actors. The story is believable and moving and the battle sequences are realistic. I dare you not to hug your kids frequently after watching this film. There are a few laugh out loud moments as well. Watching this one will make you very proud to be an American.
3,"""Happy slaves""? But it was entertaining....","Yes, the movie kind of glanced over the whole slavery issue (the old ""kindly slave master who treats his slaves as equals"" routine) but I did enjoy the battle scenes and the overall look of the film (the sets and scenery).It is well worth a look."
4,Great Movie,"This is an excelent movie. If you liked braveheart, you will definetly like the patriot. It is alot like braveheart. I would rate Braveheart about 1/2 star higher. Good movie."
