5,GREAT SHOE GREAT PRICE!!,"love martin so so much,me and my husband can spend hours watching this show. It will never get old....this will be a classic forever!"
5,Martin,Martin is the man. Anything he does will always be alright with me. He is so funny that I can watch him over and over and over and never get tried.
5,Martin Complete Seasons Three & Four,I gave a five star rating because you get both seasons for the price of one. Great value for the money. I mean what can you say it's Martin Laurence doing what he does best. All smiles over here. I would recommend this set to anyone who loves to laugh. Two thumbs up.
5,martin season 3 and 4,the dvd's came in great condition i love rewatching martin it reminds me ofjust how good the 90's tv shows were and the 90's overall
2,not the randy orton it should be?,this dvd could be good but they leave out how he put wwe to the top it was evolution. he was taught by the greatest of all time ric flair and the best of randy orton was when he first arrived. The legend killer was an old school character from the 1980's when everyone could wrestle in the business. thats how he became so popular so quickly. the reason they leave it out is because they do not want the people to see how bad wrestling is again. now that his contract is up maybe he'll go to tna wrestling where he belongs. his character stinks now waiting to put the rko it was so much better when it came out of nowhere like the diamond cutter randy orton sold out was on the right path until he started fighting cena and the other scrubs. this dvd is horrible what made randy orton was him being old school evolution after ric flair left wwe destroyed orton and this dvd shows the downslide of a promising career of a great wrestler not know.
2,Travesty,"Look the match list seems alright, but I do believe they are missing his first ever world title win. I know they don't wanna have stuff with ""he who shall not be named"", but that was a career defining match for Orton. Without that clean victory over one of the best they would have never gotten Orton to where he is today. Heck they had him in the Nitro DVD, he should be on this one."
4,False Information,Anyone else think it's weird that the sticker on the front says 3 disk collection but its only 2 disks when you open it. Anyone else see this or am I missing something? I haven't actually watched the movie yet just opened it yesterday and saw it was only 2 disks not 3.
4,One of the best wwe dvds I have ever seen!!!!,"Personally I'm not that big a fan of Orton, but this Dvd collection is really good. I couldn't help but think what if the wwe had put this much effort into some of their other projects mainly WCW themed ones. Very good production work. Hopefully they will continue this pattern for future releases...like the upcoming Austin set or even the Hart Micheals Rivalry Set. My only real gripe with this is no Benoit but come on Randys first World title win was against Benoit, pinned him cleanly to win the title. If they can finally show him on the Elimantion Chamber DVD, they could have shown him on here too, oh well!!!!"
5,Best WWE dvd yet,"This is one of the best in the WWE videos, I respect Randy alot more now! Must see for any wwe fan even if you dont like Orton."
5,Legend killer arrives,It's about time Orton got a dvd set I mean it has been almost two years since they released a set on Batista and Cena. I mean Orton is right up there with them as the new generation for the wwe although Batista is no longer around. The match selection is a good choice although I think they should have included his match with the Taker at Wrestlemania. I also noticed that they didn't include his matches with Shawn Michaels after Michaels was injured and also his matches with Jericho when Jericho returned from his music thing. I'm also happy they aren't including his matches with Wade Barrett or the nexus thing.
3,Its Alright,This book is great if you want to play the piano and the singing melody on the piano at the same time. What I didnt like about the book was exactly that. I wanted to play the songs on piano like on the cd. Not with the singing on the piano. It makes it harder to play it than if you were just playing the chords like stevie wonder does.
4,Wonderful gift!,I bought this for my dad for his birthday in March and he loves it. It arrived right on time and he hasnt stopped playing these songs on his keyboard since its arrival. I would recommend this.
3,You Better Be Good at Improvising!,"This collection includes a good sampling of Stevie Wonder's music for the general enthusiast. It includes all my favorite songs, but as other reviewers have commented, those who have memorized every song he ever recorded may be disappointed. I found the sheet music to be a bit cumbersome. Actually, I found it utterly impossible to get the feel of the music the way it is written. You do have to be a pretty advanced reader to be able to read the sheet music, but even still, it doesn't sound good the way it's written. If you want to sound like Stevie does on the recordings, you better be a darn good improviser! As one reviewer pointed out, the collection is invaluable for at least getting accurate chord changes, especially if you've been trying to figure it out playing by ear."
5,Ultimate Queen of the Night,"This is a great recording with superb casting throughout, like Pilar Lorengar, Hermann Prey and people like Ditrich Fischer-Dieskau or Ren√© Kollo in the smaller roles. Cristina Deutekom's Queen of the Night however, is the greatest treat on this recording. A dramatic coloratura with stunning staccati and effortless singing throughout the entire range. Poor Tamino doesn't have a chance but to do what this Queen orders. Solti is Solti, a must."
5,The best Zauberflote....but we want ALL of it please,"The complete performance led by Solti in 1969 for Decca is the best Zauberflote. Why this is only available as a highlights is infuriating and mysterious. It's closest competition (Bohm on DG) with the incomparable Fritz Wunderlich, does not offer nearly as uniform an excellent cast as the '69 Solti. But more importantly the Solti has a theatrical atmosphere rarely heard on an audio studio recording. The witty dialogue (particularly Prey's humor as Papageno) and exceptional shaping of ensembles is not featured on this highlight disc. With Solti's later version available there is dim hope that this masterpiece of recorded art will re-surface in it's complete form, and that is truly our loss...."
3,"Nice Kick, a bit of a bite","Good Energy drink, blue in color, does the trick in the AM and also a good mixer at night.Has a strange aftertaste."
2,"Enough already, same story with new characters","There is just so many times you can read about a woman who has to overcome fear,hatred,loathing,distrust and a gift that at times is more like a curse. A lackluster book, not as enjoyable as the first four, and a very tired and stale plot."
5,Great Software for Marketers,"This was an amazing experience in creating a marketing plan. Everything that I needed was there, along with great help and guidence throughout. The graphics the software created for my marketing plan was worth the investment. I recommend Marketing Plan Pro without question."
2,"Don't ask:""Where's the party?"" Ask: ""Where's ALL the hits?""","THESE RECORD GUYS WONDER WHY KIDS DOWNLOAD MUSIC TO MAKE THEIR OWN CD'S? tHIS COLLECTION LEAVES YOU WANTING ALL OF THE REALLY GOOD SONGS EDDIE PUT OUT AND I'M SICK OF 12-13 SONG CD'S WHEN YOU KNOW EDDIE HAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN WORTHY SONGS TO PUT ON A GREATEST HITS CD. WHEN THAT COMES OUT, THEN I'LL BUY IT. UNTIL THEN; STOP TRYIN TO FEED ME APPETIZERS WHEN I WANT THE FULL COURSE MEAL!!!"
3,Could Have Been Better,"sony's release of another Eddie Money best of has missed the boat! It appears sony wants to rehash the glory days of Eddie's work from the late 70's and early 80's. Eddie has had many great rock hits throughout the late 80's and early 90's that are in fact much better than most of the filler tracks here. How could you put "" Running Back "" on a best of cd and not ""Gimme Some Water"" ? Being that this disc is remastered the sound is incredible ! The sad thing here is sony has forgotten the great 1991-1992 Right Here release, and many of the hit singles were left off as well as the beautiful live acoustic tune ""Save A Little Room In Your Heart For Me. As stated earlier you would be hard pressed to find many songs better than the 10 classics on here we all love and know !"
3,not the best of but still good,"this is a pretty good cd but most of his smaller medium size energy hits are missing! also, including live tracks of no control and rock n roll the place are useless! i like the cd artwork nice front and back pics! but ,sony should release either a live cd recorded years ago or a cd containing eddie's big hit singles from the 70's and 80's! example, some top 40 songs added that are out of print to make people want to buy this and to think they are gettting something new! they should have included a couple songs never before released from studio recording! the best greatest hits eddie money cd is YOU CAN'T KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN! ANOTHER BEST OF COMPILATION DISSAPOINTMENT!1991's right here had some great rock singles like i'll get by and fall in love again as well as she takes my breath away! none of the songs from that cd are added!"
2,Sound Quality,I was sadly dissapointed with the sound quality of this disc. I found it lacking any brightness. I can not reccomend this disc.
4,Good mix of songs,I had forgotten how many Eddie Money songs were so good! This is a nice compilation. I am happy with my purchase.
4,there needs to be an essential eddie money double disc,just like billy joel and journey there needs to be a essential eddie money disc! eddie is a artist who has both pop and rock hits to capture his style. unlike billy joel he still has all his classic rock hits still on the radio in rotation. this is a good disc and captures some of eddie's best songs. if you want real rockin eddie from the 90's check out right here if you can find it and ready eddie! his music got better when he decided to just rock rather than have a hit single on the radio. just no givin up from love and money is also a great rock song. too many supporting tunes are missing here. the live acoustic un plug it in cd had better songs than the live tracks here.
5,good music,"Great music, I would recommend this music to anyone. it's music that you can actually listen to and understand the words"
2,"Great Posters, but bent","I loved these posters, but they were dented on one corner that was really noticeable. Think they should have used poster tubes instead of boxes."
3,"It's ok, but not worth the price","For a book of this price, I was expecting the photos of the horses to be in color. There are plenty of photos, but the only color is on the front & back cover. It's ok, but for this price, Western Horseman could do better.The horses profiled in this book are:BartenderBill CodyChicado VChubbyCustus Rastus (TB)Hank HLeo SanLittle JoeJackie BeeJaguarJoe CodyJoe MooreMonitaMr Bar NonePat Star JrPretty BuckSkipa StarTopsail Cody"
4,Boat owner,"this is a good product, i did have to modify my cranking device to attach the strap, but it worked out good."
4,Music for listening,Being an opera fan I was quite interested in listening to this music. I especially liked the notes that accompanied the music. It gives the history and meaning to the music. I was familiar with two of the operas and it was a treat to listen with renewed understanding.
5,Easy Install Fast Connection,"I recently had FiOS installed. I took our old Inspiron 8000 laptop out of the closet and decided to see if I could connect it with wireless to our router. Following the CD installation and after inserting the card, it was simple to configure the connection and be on the internet in no time with 100% link strength and quality. I recently upgraded from Windows 2000 Pro to XP Pro and went through the installation again with no problems."
2,Sure wish I had a printing press in my home...,"but I don't. No intaglio press. No letter press. Heck, I don't even have an old washing machine mangle to 'make-do' as a press, which was an authors' recommendation. This book is fine (as far as it goes) into prints you really can make at home i.e. by hand rubbing, but almost all of the chapters include projects that require a press. I was hoping for some innovative ways to do, say, etchings AT HOME and not have to drag my stuff to an art school and pay for press time. If you're so far along as to have invested in a real press in your own home studio, you already know everything that's in this book. If you want a book that's half what it purports to be, you might get a few ideas. Nothing is a total waste -- you might glean something from it that will improve your technique or broaden your experimentation, but don't count on it for prints you can really make AT HOME besides the usual monoprints and reliefs."
5,A wonderful read,"This was the first Margaret Buffie book I read and it's one of my favourites. I especially liked the setting and the use of the supernatural, but mostly it's the characters that interested me. I loved Lizzie's humour and all the struggles with her family. The storyline with the ghost was so sad and yet it couldn't have ended any other way."
3,A young girl gets a chance to view the past.,"This book is about a young girl who spends her summers every year in the same place. Well this year there is a big difference her birth father is no longer with her and the rest of her family. Instead there is her new stepfather, and this year he has convinced their mother to go down there with them (the girl, her sister, and brother), he is also tagging along. While they are down there, she visits a island that has been off limit to her. On that island she finds a ghost that she will never forget. This book was very interesting. The outcome was one that I did not expect. I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Not impressive...,"My son knew the alphabet already, and was not happy to find that he had to ""learn"" all the letters from scratch before he could do any other activities - no way to skip the first part - no flexibility. Graphics were cute, but poor design."
2,Not impressed,"'nuf said!!! Just as the title suggests I am not impressed at all, even if it was a ""cheap book"""
5,Beautiful!,"I loved this music, some of it more than others, but it is hauntingly beautiful and spiritually uplifting."
4,Insightful correlation between the Apostle and the Prophet,Dr. Hamon is versed in the apostolic and the prophetic and this books provides a very good distinction of the role of the Apostle and the Prophet and their roles for the endtime kingdom of God. Good reading!!!Simple TruthSimple Truth Too: Understanding the Bible In Everyday LifeCatch A Falling Star
5,Gods Anointed!,"I've read alot books about the whole prophet and apostle teachings, but this book was the best of the best. David Cannistraci was my Pastor and I read his book and have the audio teaching on the subject, but Bill Hammon to me is the most accurate writter on the subject. Most of the men or women who have written such books have all been under his teaching's. I am so grieved by the negative reviews I've seen, being warned myself by God not to take Prophecy in contempt and seeing the fire of God comming from this mans mouth, and just being under the anointing God has placed on this mans life makes me quiver at the thought of saying anything bad about him!!!!!!!! He goe's into the Church history and what each denomination has brought into the Church. Read it and see for yourself. I have many of his audio teachings and he's just a fun guy to be around."
1,Looking for anti-Christ!,"It used to be we were looking for the prophets who would lead us to Christ, now it's apostles. This book will have the misguided lining up as 'apostle wanna-be's'. Is Jesus not capable of leading his church anymore that we have to keep seeking after specially gifted leaders? Read this book with caution - any writing that encourages Christians to be looking for 'a person' with special giftings who they can call an apostle is dangerous. You're paving the way for anti-Christ, who will be the perfect prophet and apostle all rolled into one."
1,out-of-date,"it do not think the music is a selection of know music, it is just general music and most sound just out-of-date rather than classics."
3,"Not so ""Royal""","I was very disappointed in this pillow. The packaging is lovely, but the product is lacking. I gave it 3 stars mainly for the packaging, sadly, not for the product.First, the pillow is advertised & packaged as ""machine washable"", yet the pillow tag clearly states ""dry clean only"".Second, the pillow-or its cover- makes a ""crinkle"" sound...not a good sign of a quality down item. Last, but not least, the standard size claims 16 oz. of down fill. It weighs less than 14 oz. even with the cover!( My husband insisted on weighing it on his postal scale)!We have a lovely down comforter by Royal Velvet, but this pillow is being returned. :("
4,goose down comfort,"I've always loved the feel of real goose down, but the price of true quality has kept me from enjoying the top of the line in the last several years. Thanks to the quality and value offered by Amazon, I purchased this pillow and have been sleeping heavenly since."
2,One buyer's experience,Size and fill is what I was looking for. The fancy cover is superfluous; maybe added to cover a slight smell from the down when warm...
2,"Comfortable, but falls short","This fitness mat is thick and cushy, but I find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it's about a foot too short. My biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover (a major reason I selected this product) shrank to a completely unusable size when I washed it (in cold water, line dried). Now I'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable."
5,"Beautiful, sweet, evocative!","Parker Noon is one of those enigmatic personalities who suggests both something tangible- a southern american man- and something more esoteric- a character in a novel from a different era perhaps. His lyrics and persona on this album follow suit and the result is incredibly engaging and beautiful!His partner, Lily Wolf, is unparralleled as a musician, switching between keys, vibes and a million other instruments that most people just tinker at while she has mastered.While Parker is a personality from another era perhaps, Lily is a beauty from another planet- out of this world!Joined recently by the charismatic actor Cristina Campanella, the trio has arrived! This record is the culmination of that journey and announces their arrival with the fan fare and celebration it deserves!"
5,No Region 2??,"GCB is an absolutely fantastic show full of wit, sarcasm and laugh out loud moments - the show has not been broadcast in the UK (who knows if it will now) but as i'm sure most of us know we have our ways which is why I hope and prey that they release the series as Region 2 format and GIVE US A 2ND SERIES - SAVE GCB"
5,Best. New. Show. Period.,GCB is one of the most entertaining series to come along since the early days of desperate housewives. all of the characters on here are funny and make you root for them to succeed or see the error of their ways. if you like fast funny over the top stories with a positive resolution to them this show is for you. this show has more heart to it than any show currently on the major networks. some have given it a bad rap but just watch 3 episodes and notice the families do pull together by episode end. just go out and buy this and you will not be let down.
5,An extremely refreshing show,"This was one of the rare shows that had me switching my tv from Netflix back to the cable box. I always got very excited when it was GCB day and I looked forward to it all week. It was a breath of fresh air and I desperately hope ABC answers the call and decides to reverse their cancellation of it. To get more ratings, may I suggest airing it during the week? Anyway, what a truly hilarious, one-of-a-kind show."
5,"Fresh, Fantastic, and Fun","This series is absolutely fabulous! It is a must see/own! The writing was hilarious, the sentiment was heartfelt, and the cast is divine! There are not many shows in which combine comedy/drama so well, and so effortless as the cast/writers of GCB! WE WANT MORE!!!"
5,Best TV Show Ever,"This is hands down the best TV show that has been on TV for a while now. Soooooo much better than all of those ""reality"" shows!"
5,Hilarious show!,"This show has easily become one of my favorites! It is the perfect show to take the Desperate Housewives slot now that it has come to an end. Each of the women and their families are unique and have their own personalities/quirks it's hard not to love even the roughest of them. From the first episode I was hooked, by the second I was a fan, same goes for my family who watch it as well. From a born and raised Texan, I tip my hat to the creators, and ABC for making this show possible! And I also applaud all of the wonderful studios that are now releasing the DVD/Blu-Ray seasons a week or two after the season finale, rather than having to wait almost a whole year to get it. Let's hope this speedy production process carries on into the film industry."
3,I think this show is okay,I can also see it had promise in beginning but then some where down the line the show lost momentum so I can see why it didn't last very long on the air.
5,The BEST show thats come out in a long time!!!,"I love this show its the kind of show that would be very popular & last for many years given the chance & if the popularity of a show decided if it stayed on or not!! It would be like Sex & the City, Desperate Housewives, Friends & more!!!Finally a great show that was different came out & ABC cancels it also!!!The response from fans on SAVE GCB facebook petition & Wendy Williams petition has been awesome i believe another network will definately pick this show up if ABC dont!!!!Everyone go to SAVE GCB on facebook & sign the petition to save this wonderful show that i cant imagine not being on for many years to come esp w/ Desperate Housewives gone!!!LOVE YOU GCB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SAVE GCB"
5,GCB -,"I love this well-written, witty show. I hated to hear ABC canceled the program. This show is a great vehicle for the acting chops of Kristin Chenoweth and Annie Potts(nice to see her back on tv). In this day of network-driven, cheaply produced, unscripted/reality programming, GCB was great bit of escapism. Order the DVD and see why more and more are turning to networks such as TNT for original, scripted programming. ABC,you should reconsider."
5,THE BEST SHOW EVER,"If you love real life comedy and an allstar cast this is the show for you!!! They're right about everything being bigger in Texas. The catfights, the humor, the laughs, and the morals. A lot of people have criticized this show as being anti-Christian, but they've obviously never seen it. Every episode has a moral delivered by wit and situations that make you cry from laughing so hard. You can't just watch one episode, there will never be enough. You won't regret this purchase."
5,Best Show Ever!! ABC Please Save GCB!!!!!,"I truly love this show and I am praying that ABC will reconsider. This is such a great show and it pokes fun but also has great messages. It has an exceptionally talented cast and deserves to have more seasons!!! I am a Christian and I can't get enough of GCB!! Life is crazy & messy our world needs more off the wall brilliantly written shows, that allow you to escape yet make you think too!GCB: The Complete First SeasonI love, love , love this show and it would be a sin if ABC really does cancel it!!"
5,Best show!!!,This is typical ABC. They cancel more shows than any other network in my opinion. You hear this is a controversial show- are you freaking kidding me?! On abc family they have Life Of An American Teenager. They make fun of the show on the soup and all they seem to talk about is sex and teenage pregnacy. They have a show coming up called Baby Daddy. How can u call gbc conversial and not these kinds of shows that kids are watching. I'm a christian and gcb doen't offend me. It's entertainment. I love the cast and their characters. The writing is so witty. I loved this show!!! I'm getting to where I don't even want to get inti abc shows cause they'll probably cancel them.
1,despicable,Despicable they would single out one religious demographic. Christ is God the Son and to portray His daughters in such a disgraceful manner is a dishonor to His Name.
5,SAVE GCB,"Love this show, so sad that it got cancelled! So excited for this item to get here, missed two episodes, so now I get to see them!"
5,Please Save GCB!,LOVE this show! Cannot believe it was cancelled! Hoping Paul Lee and ABC decide another season is a good idea! Please save GCB :)
5,Why! Why?! Why?!,"This show was campy, fun and just all-around entertaining! I cannot believe that ABC decided to cancel it! Will purchase Season 1, to savor each delicious and hilarious episode! These women deserve better----hopefully, another network will be intelligent enough to pick up a series that has such potential and a devoted fan base! If you are looking for an entertaining watching party, grab this right away! You won't be disappointed.....P.S. Just received my DVD of Season 1 today and quickly watched the extras----was laughing so hard, watching the bloopers, ""Bigger in Texas"" and deleted scenes. Watching this cast interact with one another and hearing the ""back story"" on the show only makes me love it more and sad to know that ABC canceled it. They have such chemistry together which is evident as you watch the show. Will enjoy watching the season again, over and over! Some network needs to wake up and give this show another chance. Look at all of the people who are ready for Season 2!"
5,Entirely worth spending my lunch money,"Three things: Hilarious, Smart and Addicting. It's a SHAME that ABC has decided to stop production on this series! My friends and I had such a good time dining to it and now it's gone.We can bring it back! I bought my copy, you buy yours!Go to ABC.com or hulu.com to catch a few episodes. The first one should be enough to get you hooked."
5,Best new show TV,"So sad they canceled the best thing to come on TV in years. Both men and women enjoyed it! Funny, witty and fantastic. wish they would SAVE GCB !!!! Brilliant acting too :)"
5,GCB.... Best show this year!!!!!!!!!!!!,"GCB, heard about it on the Wendy Williams show and caught up on the episodes on the ONdemand service.. HILARIOUS and well written...GREAT CASTING...there was not one character I would change! ABC you are foolish to end a great series! I for one am a fan and this show had great promise!!! Shame on you ABC, The Good Christian B*tches giveth, and ABC taketh away!"
5,GCB: The Complete Season... The best show on TV!,This is the first show in YEARS that I have actually anticipated watching every week. I am sooooooo upset that ABC has decided to cancel it. I hope they will reconsider! At least I will be able to have the first season... hopefully more will come!GCB: The Complete First Season
5,I want more!!,I love this show! It is witty and charming! Great Cast and plots. I wish they would do another season!
5,Love it!,I love this show! It is witty and charming! Great Cast and plots. I wish they would do another season!
5,Amazing Show BRING IT BACK!,"This is one of the funniest and clever shows on right now! It was on a bad time slot for lots to watch, I always watched on Hulu, and think its a great show! Please bring back! Amazing cast and so funny! I think more would watch if it was on a different time!"
5,Hysterical!!!,"I thought this was going to be hokey, but I absolutely fell in love with it! I can't wait for season 2!!!! (FINGERS CROSSED!!!)"
2,this show sucked!,"kristin chenoweth does not look to be the same age as the star that she was supposed to go to highschool with. i got as far as the star getting a job at the restaurant called Boobies. I am not making up the name! this show was stupid and did not make me laugh. I got it because i saw Kristin Chenoweth in some movie and she was really funny. not this tv show,that's for sure! 2 thumbs the eff down!"
5,Love This Show,"This show was one of the best shows on TV. As soon as each episode ended, I wanted to see the next episode right away! I really hope they reconsider cancelling the show!"
5,What a blast,This show is really fun and I looked forward to it every week. Lots of laughs and a roaring good time! The characters are really funny and got layered more and more every week. You will enjoy it for sure. Good clean fun!
5,Amazing show,"This episode is so good! They actually canceled making another season. This show is just so funny and love sitting down and watching it. If you haven't seen it would be worth the money to buy the dvd, you wont regret it"
5,Such a great show,I love this show. So upset that it has been cancelled. At least now I can watch the shows forever. These actors are great. They all work together to make this an awesome show.
5,Can't get enough!,What a great show!!! I can't wait to get the DVD so I can watch it all over again and again and AGAIN! This is a show for the whole family. We would sit down every Sunday night and watch it together. We are hoping that ABC will do the right thing and bring GCB back so that we can have our Sunday Family nights again. Please bring GCB back!
5,"LOVE THIS SHOW, HEARTBROKEN IT WONT BE RETURNING","This show was a breath of fresh air to the boring reality filled line up on nearly every channel. It was so heart breaking to hear that the network has cancelled another good show, especially one which barely had the chance to get into the storylines! I really hope ABC reconsiders their decision, we can use another show that actually entertains over some singing show ie.. Duets..really? GCB is a really funny and exciting show, I couldnt wait for each new episdoe! PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!!"
5,5-Star Everything!,"""GCB"" was a fantastic show. A wonderful cast who could act comedy very well, wonderful premise, and juicy story-lines that the actors acted the hell out of. Miriam Shor, Kristin Chenoweth, Jennifer Aspen, and Annie Potts all combined to create strong female characters whom I enjoyed watching every week! It was so well-written and one of the best female-led comedies in a long time. I hope that the network heads re-consider the cancellation... It was a great show and a great method of sharing both the bad and GOOD sides of Christianity. Until then, I am so glad to have the DVD to re-watch, because I definitely will be re-watching!! :)"
5,Hilarious Show...Shame on ABC,"This was the 2011-2012 season's funniest new addition by far. Second best show overall (on to CBS's Scandal, which doesn't matter because they air on different nights). I am so disappointed in ABC for canceling, and sincerely hope they reconsider or that it gets picked up by another network with the same actors, writers, and producers. I'm a Southern Baptist who doesn't take myself too seriously. And I definitely saw exaggerated versions of so many women I know in this show. If you are looking for a good laugh, this will do it."
5,Save this show,One of the best shows ever. Hands down. Please save this show! Nothing can replace it! How can you not love te characters. It has so much To offer!
5,Great quality,"The discs are in great condition, we love the show. The only downer is that there are no more episodes to watch!"
5,WHY DID THEY CANCEL!,"This was literally my favorite show in a long time, after desperate housewives ended I was SO glad this show came on. The thing that annoys me is that they cancelled it! I mean do they not know anything about controversy? Jersey Shore had most of their ads dropped because of the controversy and we can see where that show ended up! BRING GCB BACK PLEASEEEE!!!!"
5,ABC Listen Up! We Want GCB Back!,"I'm so sick of the garbage reality shows on tv. GCB was one of the best shows to hit the air in a long time. Smart, funny and fast paced, this star studded show was cut short too soon! Why would ABC cut a hit show? GCB was and is the best show on Sunday nights!ABC Please bring back GCB Give it a second chance."
5,LOVE GCB!!!,I think GCB is the best new show to come on in a long time! I seriously LOVE it and DVRed it every week so i could watch it over and over again
5,Maybe the best comedy to come around in years,"I am really shocked that ABC canceled this show. It was funny, sassy, and completely entertaining. Why they keep shows like The Bachelor and Bachelorette and drop this show really puzzles me. Be sure and buy this even tho it was canceled. It is a hoot and I am sure you will love it."
5,Save GCB!!!!,"I have watched every episode that came out, sometimes even twice! I LOVE this show SO much! It's halarious and entertaining beyond any other show on abc(besidesDH). I was so happy to have a new show to watch to fill the void of DH being over. I can't believe ABC would cancel such a great high rated tv show because of some pathetic group of mom's which is nothing more than a HATE group saying the most nasty things about this tv show. If you don't like it then DON'T WATCH IT! If you love GCB then sign the petition to help keep the show at: savegcb.com!!!!"
4,Buy this DVD set then go to saveGCB.com,"There is a large movement online to have GCB renewed by ABC or picked up by another network. The petition' has over 68,000 signatures. Go to saveGCB.com to sign and help keep the show alive. Please buy the season one DVD set as well. Networks look at DVD sales to gauge the popularity of a series and a strong showing for GCB can only help the cause."
5,Awesome show!,This is one of the funniest shows of all time! I looked forward to Sunday nights so that I could see a new episode! Kristen Chenoweth and Annie Potts are hilarious!
5,Great Comedy Buy it!!!,"Hilarious, witty, original, smart, fun, great characters, excellent writing, fabulous wardrobe, and Dallas makes the perfect setting for an unbelievably good time!!! Buy this DVD, laugh till it hurts, then go to [...] and tell ABC you want more GCB!!!"
4,Very Funny,"This show really surprised me and I like it! I've never heard of any of the actors, but they did a great job. I can identify with the holier than thou attitudes, the good and not so good memories of high school, and the drama that comes with reuniting with old friends and acquintances. I recommend this series."
5,GCB on DVD? What more could a girl want? How about GCB back on ABC next season as well!!!,"I loved this series on the air and I love it on DVD! Every bit of fabulousness that graced my TV set on Sunday nights, is back anytime I want to pop the DVDs in... but with even more fabulous DVD extras including deleted scenes, bloopers, audio commentary and a whole list of other features!Annie Potts was the reason I started watching this show, but, it was the whole cast dynamic that kept me tuning in each week (including Annie of course!).A rip-riot show, packed with so much Texas Glam, smart humor and just sheer awesomeness. Pick up the DVDs today, you won't be disappointed!No spoilers here, but ABC... you can't leave us hanging like this after that season finale! Please bring GCB back and let us know what the future has in store for our fabulous girls!"
5,Please Save GCB!,"This show is amazing! Great story (the writers ROCK) and incredible, funny, gorgeous cast. Was SO looking forward to the next season to find our what happens next with these crazy characters. PLEASE ABC, reconsider and do not cancel GCB!!!"
3,Its what I can Afford,"My bird makes a sticky nasty mess of the stuff, and his cage is covered in plastic because of it. He does fine on it tho. He wastes alot of it id say and gets him self covered in it. and his beak. I didnt have that issue with the Nekton, But I cant afford the stuff."
1,I JUST DON'T LIKE LIARS !,"THE AUTHOR'S ""WORD OF KNOWLEDGE GIVEN IN A DREAM VISION"" WAS IN PRINT BACK IN THE '90'S IN A BOOK WRITTEN BY JOHNATHON GRAY ABOUT MY FRIEND RON WYATT'S DISCOVERY OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS ON THE MERCY SEAT EXACTLY AS ""FORETOLD"" BY THE AUTHOR, IN JOHNATHAN'S BOOK ENTITLED, ""THE ARK OF THE COVENANT"" ALSO AVAILABLE FROM AMAZON. NELL, RON'S WIDOW SHOULD SUE THE AUTHOR FOR PLAGIARISM, THE TEXT IS ALMOST WORD FOR WORD FROM JOHNATHAN'S BOOK !"
4,Robust tea flavor. Very happy with it.,"I actually bought a small box of this tea just to try it out. I used it for a few weeks and thought ""That was good, but nothing special."" But after 2 weeks of being back on my old tea, I miss it. So I'm buying some more. :) My normal US tea is Newmans Organic or Luzianne, so that's all I have to compare it to.Note: Each PG bag has about 2 times the weight of tea that 1 bag of a US tea bag has. Or put another way, 2 PG bags equal 1 ""family"" bag of US tea. So while it looks more expensive, in the long run it's not really. In fact, I can make a full gallon of ice tea with just 8 of these bags. So the price is about the same or better, and the tea tastes better in my opinion."
3,"Strong, high caffeine content","It is a very strong tea, but I can't say it is extremely flavoreful. This tea made my heart race. I will not buy it again."
3,Nice enough.,"I bought this in a desperate attempt to replace another (related) H2O product that has been discontinued. It is sadly nowhere near as good as that product. However, taken on its own, I like it okay. It's annoying to have to shake it so much before it's usable, and the consistency is a bit thin. However, it doesn't feel oily on my face or leave residue, which is a big plus. Unfortunately, it's way too expensive for the amount you get--I should've paid more attention to the size/volume listed, but that's my fault. At least you don't need much to cover your face."
5,I love it,I like it so much.i have been using for more than 5years and will more and more year.H2O is the best
4,This thing kicks some bass,"The radio is pretty sweet. Loud and kicking! What more can you ask for from portable radio. It's everything as advertised. My only drawbacks so far have been the lack of shuffle on MP3 CD's and the lower volume output on AUX in. The shuffle thing may be an operator error. The AUX in issue is also found in my car radio, so this must be standard. Otherwise, this thing shakes some booty."
2,It's OK....WHEN IT WORKS!,I don't know if it's a defective product or it was known to be defective when sold but even when my daughter and I work around that which is not working - it's still not that great of a LeapPad program.
5,Wow! This is the best invention since peanut butter.,"This is a toy that every kid should have. Not only is it something they enjoy playing with for hours on end and days at a time, but it is also educational. It is helping my daughter tremendously in school. We are able to sit down together to enjoy this toy. We have now ordered more of the books and are looking forward to more books they come up with. My 1 month old son will really benefit from this toy also."
3,Only for War Buffs!,"If you are interested in the history of the 2nd World War, you will probably find this book quite interesting.However if you are, like I was, expecting to find references to Morotai Island in it, you will be disappointed."
2,Not for Me,"I take Biotin supplements on a regular basis and I had run out of my ""regular"" ones. I happened to be shopping on Amazon one day and just decided that I would try these, since I've ordered from this company before and liked their products. Don't know if it was the ""taste"" or what that bothered me but I did not enjoy taking them. Finished the bottle and then went back to my regular brand."
3,not working... yet,"Based on some reviews that 2 capsules of 5000mcg give an adverse effects (hair falls off, dryer skin), I decided to take only 1 capsule. It's been 3 weeks and no change for me. Still dry skin and lifeless hair. One more week then I'll up the dose to the recommended 2 capsules a day."
2,Not so hot,"My girls and I use this, we did not see desired results. We was looking for hair growth, no change in our hair at all. I would not recommend this product at all.Obedience Is Better Than Sacrifice"
3,Breakouts,"Made me breakout on my face (I drink at least 8 glasses a water a day, didn't help). Can't attest to hair growth. I took for about 3 months and constantly had braids. Did NOTHING for nails. Won't purchase again"
4,Now Foods Biotin 5000mcg. 120 Vcaps,"I gave a review at the beginning of this form on Biotin 5000 Healthy Hair, Skin, etc. I don't remember ever having taken this product so I can't give you a summary on it."
4,Give it time,"I have been taking biotin for over a year and a half. I started with a much lower dose to help improve my nails which were breaking off and cracking. I couldn't even keep my thumb nails to stop breaking off far below the quick. I tried other things first like strengthening nail polish, putting lotion on my hands, using rubber gloves and they made at best, a slight difference. So I went to the internet to read up on other ways to address the problems (like taking gelatin). I found out that the only thing that there is scientific evidence that helps is taking biotin. I started with much much lower dosages, but started taking two 5000mg capsules about a year ago and have noticed steady improvement. It takes nails six months to grow out so it takes that long to really know if it working. I now have a full set of nails and am very pleased. BUT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET THERE."
5,Save your hair!,"I ran out of this and I didn't get another bottle until my hair started falling out again. It's great to have a back up bottle of this. My hair doesn't fall out, when I take this. This is a great product if you are losing your hair. It might take a couple of weeks to a month to work, but it definitely works! I would recommend this to any one that is losing their hair!"
2,I'd rather be bald than have cystic acne.,"I haven't had acne since I was a teenager. After 2 months of biotin, I haven't noticed too much gain in hair growth (although the hair that I do have appeared to have thickened) but last week I got a breakout of cystic acne! Doing some research, I found that others have experienced the same issue."
2,Hmm... makes me sad,"I read all the reviews and was pumped to see what Biotin could do for me.Well, after two bottles I can safely say it didn't do a thing for me. (I did give it a couple of months.) My nails are just as brittle and my hair is just as thin. There was no extra energy going on. Nothing. Dang it.Supplements don't work for everybody: I get that. Evidently I'm in the minority here, but just want to give a heads up to others who have great hopes of a miracle happening by using this product.I give this two stars because I can honestly say it's not a faulty product. It just didn't help ME at all - but I wish it did."
4,Good,"It's good, I definitely notice my hair feeling stronger. I don't take this everyday but it does work. I'm happy with this purchase."
5,Best so far,"I have tried several different brands of Biotin. I have received the most benefits from this brand compared to the pricier products I have used. I have been using this brand for 6+ months. My nails have always been thin and peel. Since using this product my nails are strong and long, I have to clip them (never needed to before). My hair is also pretty thin in the front, and I have had new growth and its starting to thicken up. Love this product!"
4,Haven't been using product for a long time.,"So far it's good. I haven't noticed any dramatic changes. I.e. cystic acne etc. Will update product feedback after prolonged use.2013I bought his product a year ago. I haven't noticed any acne. What I have noticed is the tremendously THICK hair on my head. My nails grow the fastest they've ever grew in life. Very pleased with this product. One downside is that I do feel lethargic after taking this despite the comments about raging with energy. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. I only take one a day. Other than that, everything's good."
1,Lame,"This product didn't do anything but make me burp. No hair growth, my skin wasn't any different. This product sucked."
5,I'm waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don't know.,I'm waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don't know.I'm waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don't know.I'm waitting glow up for my hair. Not yet. I don't know.
2,Not max strength.,I need maximum strength. Volume too light. No difference in loss or thinning. Hair is still not filled in. I was disappointed.
3,Didn't use it long enough to see results!,I used this for about 2 weeks and only took one a day until I started noticing more acne. Stopped using product right away and my skin cleared up. I understand people react differently to Biotin so I will try another product.ps. didn't use it long enough to really notice a change in my hair.
1,CA Prop 65 warning,"I'm only giving this one star because I noticed the CA Prop 65 warning and wondered why, so I called Now Foods (I've noticed it on other products of theirs too). I was unimpressed with the answer which was basically retailers just put this warning on products across the board to cover their butts in case it ships to California. He said it's done to other companies too. Weird because I haven't noticed it on other companies. He then said I should call Amazon and ask them why they're putting the warning on there. I said, No, I think you should be calling Amazon because it's your product. I'd think you would want to clear it up so there isn't a warning there because it's misleading and causes me to not purchase your product. He wasn't interested."
1,Causes acne that never goes away....,"about 2 months of taking this, i started to break out with acne. i have alway had flawless skin even as a teen. I did not change anything about my diet except adding biotin daily. My hair grew some but in exchange for the unbearable acne, no thank you. Now, 2 months later I am still still struggling with acne. I have spent hundreds on buying acne mendications and my skin is scarred now too. I can't leave the house without makeup an dbefore I never wore makeup. Just stick with a balanced diet and dont put this in your body."
2,biotin,"Used it about for 8 months. According to the reviews it helped a lot of people, but really don't want to disapoint you guys, it didn't help me at all. I have fine and thin hair. What I noticed castor oil helped me a little, used it as hair masks, at least I stopped losing hair. Now will try Hair Revive 5, have a hope for it."
3,Botin,I've experienced less shedding of my hair and the new growth is thicker and my hair has more elasticity. will continue to see if i can get more growth.
3,These caps are huge!,"Anytime i order Biotin in the same 5000mcg, it's usually a tiny pill and i miss the tiny pill. These veggie caps are huge at least double the tiny biotin veggie caps i normally get. With all the vitamins i take i love it when i have a tiny vitamin. So yeah, i'm sorry but i won't be ordering these again:("
3,Haven't given it the chance to work for me,"I bought these pills because I am trying to grow out my hair. Unfortunately, the product made me break out tremendously. I had heard about this before buying, but was hoping I'd be part of the lucky ones who don't break out because of it. These are potent pills, 5000 mcg so I took 1 every 5 days (I have taken 3 pills) but my breakouts were unbearable for me so I stopped using them. Others including close friends of mine have had no trouble with breakouts because of it and have seen significant amount of hairgrowth from it, so I guess everybody is different. I think I'm going to open the capsule and split the powder into sections and take them with juice or something so I can take a smaller dose and see how that goes. I have heard great things so I won't give up yet! These are pretty cheap and thats why I bought them, so if you are interested in them I say try them out, they might be perfect for you!"
2,Definitely can cause acne!,"I ordered this product for my husband to help his hair grow. I also decided to try it out to get my hair to grow faster. I used to have acne prone skin, but haven't had problems since using oil to cleanse my skin. Despite all of the reviews that mentioned getting acne, I decided to try it. Big mistake! I took one pill the first day and noticed 2 blemishes on my face the next day (I haven't had spots like that at all in the last few months since using oil cleansing.). I wasn't sure if it was a coincidence or not, so I took another pill the next day. Two more blemishes on the other side of my face after that! Definitely not taking this anymore. It seems that it works great for some people, but then it totally breaks out other peoples faces....and I am one of those people. My husband has not yet experienced this and will continue to take it until otherwise."
2,No results,"I took these twice daily for 3 months. I got no results what so ever. I switched brands first to purvana and got shiner, thicker hair. After 4 months, quality control issues with purvana caused me to switch to a vitamin shoppe brand. So far so good. Will update in 3 months."
2,Bad acne!,"I'm 21 years old. Have had a pimple here and there but I've been mostly clear. I started on 1000mcg Biotin once a day for my hair and nails about a month ago.. in about 2 weeks, my face was really oily! I literally had to wash my face like 3 times a day. New zits showed up too so I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago and my face has been less oily, but I have a really deep pimple on my cheek, and just noticed this morning a really deep bump on my face by my ear! Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I've never had it this bad in my life.."
1,Did nothing for me,"I read reviews on Biotin and I decided to go with this one because I have things I use from NOW Foods like their Natural Oils, but I have to say I am so disappointed with this product, it did absolutely nothing for me when I first started taking it I was getting crazy headaches I didn't think it was the pills until I notice I wouldn't get the headache on the days I forgot to take the pill and so I decrease my dose from every day to every other day and I saw no results in hair, skin or nails so I've decided to stop taking this because frankly the pills are quite large and theres nothing I hate more then swallowing pills I do see another brand on amazon that the reviews say the pills are small and effective but the dose is more 10000 compared to this 5000 but I will be giving it a try cause these pills are just useless so glad I got these on a gift card."
2,No difference,I was lookin for a vitamin/ supplement for my hair and nails. I didnt notice any difference with this product after 6 months. I started taking pre natel gummie vitamins and my hair is long and silky. My face is clear and I couldnt be happier. I dont recommened this product.
5,Products works......on dogs.,"In conjunction with gelatin, Biotin has helped my dog's problem with losing his nails. At one point, my dog lost all of his nails, but now they are growing back and we are able to dremmel them to continue to strengthen them. The process has taken some time, but with some patience and persistance, this product does work."
5,Good stuff,I really like this product I noticed improvements in a short period of time. My nails are stronger and healthier and my hair is growing I would recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their nails or hair or both. The only downside is that you get an increase in hair growth everywhere.
5,Awesome,"This product is amazing. Ive been using it a little over 2 weeks and my finger and toe nails have grown and are very strong. I had to file them down a bit because they were growing so fast. I also noticed a slight difference in my hair. My hair line is starting to become full. I noticed little curly baby hairs that weren't as defined before. I definately recommend this product, especially for nails."
3,Be prepared,"I have been taking Biotin at the 5,000 mcg level daily now for about a month. I have noticed that my skin and scalp are much oilier than before, but that's okay as I had dry scalp and combination skin. I have to shampoo my hair more often (daily instead of every other day) b/c it's blonde and it really shows oil. I started taking Biotin b/c I have very weak nails that peel and split. My nails are stronger, but nothing miraculous. I think I'll finish off the bottle and see if it's worth the extra face shininess and shampooing! Also, as others have said, drink lots of water!"
4,VERY GOOD; JUST....,"I'm a male (mid 30's) and I've been taking this pills for 1.5 months and my hair is growing like it never did before... long, strong and fast. Before buying, I read that some people were having acne problems... well, Im not exeption to the rule. I got quite some pimples every week, so be prepared to deal with that. Apart from the pimples, very good product."
1,Not effective,"I have been taking 2.5 mg of Biotin via Appearex brand supplements for 3 years but was looking for a lower cost alternative. Even though the NOW brand are 5mg biotin, they are just not effective. My fingernails returned to the original condition where they would tear very close to the nailbed as soon as some growth was attained. Either lower bioavailability or something in the compounding, but this just doesn't have the desired effect on my fingernails. I am going back to Apperex."
2,Poor translation,"Not sure who did (or who checked) the translation, but it's not great. I like having stories for my daughter that are connected to her background, but it is hard to read (especially for a tired parent) and later runs the risk of teaching her improper English."
5,great,"I bought 2 pairs to bring to burning man and they were great. during the day I used the tinted plastic, and at night I had to change it to the clear one. They're kinda hard to snap on and off, but thats better than them just falling off. they saved my eyes."
1,How did this book get published?,"Okay. I almost care about what happens in this book but the characters dialogue is KILLING me. I'm at page 175 and I'm just done! The writer has killed my interest in finishing this novel. Cliche, cliche, cliche. Who edited this thing? These characters have NO depth thru dialogue or action. It does have a premise of some small amount of interest. The idea of filming in New Orleans in that class structure SHOULD be interesting but the dialogue! These characters don't have an original line ANYWHERE. Also the dynamic between characters is not explained or well supported. The transitions throught the scenes are choppy and downright confusing at times, not cute and edgy (as I think she was trying for). Sorry to say this book is not worth the money. Maybe one of her later novels is a better read. If not, then being a ""USA Today Bestselling Author"" is not a sign of good work anymore!"
1,an arrogant one-sided tall tale,"After reading just a few chapters, it's apparent that Marty is one of those arrogant people who believe they are never the problem, it's always everybody else! Being familiar with some mentioned in Marty's 'story', it's imperative that readers know that this tale is NOT an accurate portrayl of events! The only constant in this book is that everyone is always doubting him, his wife, his attorney's, the government, his friends, and when Marty could hold no ground with his petty counter-suit against the agents, HIS OWN representation settled! Against ""his wishes"" of course. Nobody has doubted Marty's technical ability, it's his character that's always and will always, be in question."
2,Flip flop,"They flip flop in back when I walk, even if I tighten them. This is defeating my purpose of not having tight shoes. From now on, I will only buy sandals with a strap . I'll keep them by the front door for getting mail and taking out the garbage . I got them at a good price and didn't want to loose 11 or 12 dollars sending them back ."
5,Fantasy. Young to middle elementary.,"This story of Greek mythology is about Aethra's son Theseus. He was brave. One day he moved a boulder and found golden sandals and a sword, which were left by his father, King Aegeus, which meant it was time for him to go to his father in Athens. Thesus met with many foes and monsters on his journey. In nearby Crete, King Minos kept a terrible minotaur, who wanted 14 young people from Athens to be sacrificed. Theseus volunteer to go, and when he arrived bravely in Crete, King Minos' daughter was impressed and sought help for him. He killed the minotaur during the night, then escaped with everyone including the King's daughter. Poseidon came to their aid in the escape.Beautiful, detailed, colorful drawings."
2,Not the best,"This has a lot of detailed information on the imperial government, however the military aspects are lacking. If you want simple information such as the statistics of a TIE-Bomber or a how many squadrons and troops a Star Destroyer carries, you won't find that information here. Worse yet, the order of battle diagrams that take up several pages appear to use symbols that weren't included on the key. At best, it's a good look at the Empire from a broad perspective. At worst, it's vague and unhelpful.This is also the older edition of the book. If you want the latest edition, you should look at the hard cover, ISBN 0-87431-210-8."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this CD under the mistaken assumption that it was a follow-up to the first Black Tie compilation. In fact, it is a three-song collection probably made up of tunes that didn't make the cut for the original effort by this B-List musical celebrity line-up. When I tell you that one of the songs is ""Away In A Manger"", I trust that you will heed my warning."
2,"Be Aware, Bobby Fuller Does Feature On This Recording.","Sadly Bobby Fuller died in strange circumstances in 1966.This album is put out by Bobby Fuller Drive, which includes, among others, his brother Randy Fuller.The collected 14 songs feature several written by the Fuller brothers and members of The Crickets.There is little wrong with the playing, except these were recorded between 1999 -2003, basically 30 + years since Bobby died.So, while the tracks are well chosen, it may be for very commited fans due to it not coming from the 1960s."
4,"Breakin Rocks ""ROCKS""","I've had this CD now for months and I continue to hear new things each time I listen. This work is so honest and real. You can tell these player's are playing from the heart. Every cut moves me big time. This is so much better than the music that is put out today from the biggies, it's from the soul of this group.Monte Paul (drummer)"
5,amazing,Nicholas lens does not receive the praise he deserves this is a wonderful beginning to one of the most brilliant trilogy's in history. everyone should listen to them. A wonderful piece that will make you rethink music of this genre.
5,the best mini car,I used this car to race and i was first mostly because when I ramed the zipzap car the zipzap car fell apart then I ramed the microsizer and it also broke so I was placed automatically first
5,"in a word ""superb""","This DVD is a must have for any Kenny Rankin fan. I find myself somewhat envious of the people that were actually there for the performance. Also, this is the best sounding DVD I've ever encountered, bar none. In all, a superb effort on the part of the musicians, the cameramen and the sound engineers."
5,Jazz Channel Presents Kenny Rankin,"If you like Kenny Rankin, you'll love this performance. He is in fine form here, his amazing tenor as melodic as ever. His back up band is outstanding, but the great thing about Kenny is that he can put on just as good a show with just his guitar, or singing acapella, for that matter. The best thing about this DVD is the interview with Kenny, which gives a insight into his creativity and his personal battles, all of which have made him a great artist and a truly sensitive and good man."
5,Birds of Kenya,We're received the book quickly. It was in excellant condition. We're very pleased with the transaction.
4,a beautiful and thorough book.,"The size and format of this book make it rather unwieldy as a field guide. The text and drawings are, however, comprehensive and beautiful. Immensely helpful and a joy to peruse anywhere."
4,Down Memory Lane,"There are more comprehensive books on premiums, but I doubt there are more nostalgic. This might be considered a more focused update of ""Jim Harmon's Nostalgia Catalogue,"" by the same author. The book addresses the shows, in alphabetical order (with cross-references to shows with title changes)twice: once for show descriptions; then to list premiums. Included are show-related premiums from other media (comic books) and stores.The author makes two points: the book doesn't attempt to be all-encompassing. As the author puts it, ""Reading this book will tell you something about the value of premiums, but certainly not everything."" He also warns of counterfeits and confusion of items (""...some real items may be misrepresented to be something else."")Many of the illustrations are monochrome, but there is a section of color photos, too. This is a good complement to other radio-premium books."
1,waste of money,"This DVD should be given out free with orders. It is NOT worth your time or money. Do some searching, ask some bee people and get a book or a different tape. Very short dvd."
3,Significant Discussion on the What - Not the How,"Torkom Saraydarian was a great teacher, and his books are a good read for the seeker. Having said that, this one isn't his best by a long shot. The book discusses the elements of psychism - both higher and lower. However, it is predominantly definitional. There isn't really any ""breakthrough"" per se, nor is there a path outlined to the reader to truly achieve breakthrough. Instead, the general concepts are discussed, there are significant and important caveats and general guidelines for the seeker, and a good overview of psychism and the constitution of the spiritual entity. It is a decent book for the beginner, and being the first volume in the Vision Series might be written at the right level for a novice. However, it truly needed more depth to be useful."
5,Spectacular,"Unified Tribe is a great band. I have known Magic for almost 5 years and was blown away from listening to this CD. The production and material is of the highest quality and this group will be a force to reckon with in years to come. They are definitely reminiscent of great bands such as EWF and Chicago. All of the members are diverse and beautiful people. I definitely recommend this CD for all Jazz, Pop, R&B, Soul, Funk, and Rock lovers."
1,Unified Tribe,"Good sound, talented musicians but they play to a minority audience instead appealing to a wider group. Good future possibilities but they need to grow musically wider or they will be a niche group."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"This is a product to keep coming back to...dispite the price. It's texture feels great on my skin...it smells fresh/earthy, I like it. It makes a difference."
4,Entertaining Follow up to The Money Game,"Super Money is the follow up book to the earlier and wildly successful Money Game by 'Adam Smith' the pseudonym chosen by George Goodman. Super Money provides a series of linked vignettes of the adventures in the pursuit of money. The big news from this 1970s book is its identification of Warren Buffett (yes, that one) as the outstanding money manager of his time. Forty years ago 'Adam Smith' got it right with Mr. Buffett. The remainder of the book is just as accurate and informative even though it's the Old Old Thing. I would also more highly recommend the early book, The Money Game."
1,Boring,I got this book because having heard it is a classic but I never made it past the first chapter because the writing is this old style and it's really boring to the core.
1,"Great Music, Terrible Recording","As you can tell, I am a huge Neph fan, and man is it great to have them back.This album isnt as good as their older stuff, but I like it for the most part. McCoy can set a mood and there is an energy here that is alluring like most of their stuff. She and 2525 are my favorites.It just is hard to listen to. It is way too compressed...everything is equally loud, and that makes it impossible to listen to for any long period of time. Dawnrazor, and The Nephilim for instance didnt have this problem. Never thought a band like the FOTN who seem to maintain a large amount of control over their production would fall victim to the LOUDNESS WAR...google it."
1,What Happened?,"I really liked the Fields until this album came out. I've even seen the stupid movie Carl and Iggy were in but this album just should have never have been made. Boring and repetitive are the two words that come to mind when listening to this album. Songs tend to build up for 5 minutes and then never go anywhere. The only song that seemed to have any life to it was the last track but who wants to hear ""In the Year 2525"" 80000000 times. If you buy this your just wasting your money. I know the Fields fanboys and girls will knock my review and proclaim this album the second coming of christ but it really isn't."
4,The best guide to traffic cycling,"John Franklin's _Cyclecraft_ is about how to ride a bike safely and efficiently in the seemingly harsh world of motor traffic. Franklin presents the specific techniques that cyclists need to know to start off, move along, turn safely, avoid hazards of all types, and maneuver in unusual or difficult situations. The diagrams in the book are lucid, Franklin's instructions are specific without being pedantic, and his points are clearly made and backed up with evidence and experience.The lone drawback to this book for anyone who lives outside the United Kingdom or Ireland might be that some of the information is specific to traffic standards in those countries. The most obvious of these is driving on the left, and Americans like me will have to think ""right"" whenever Franklin writes ""left.""This is a very minor nit, however. There is no book yet published in North America that is so succinct yet so complete on the practice of cycling for transportation."
1,This is not the book that is spoken in Bible!!!,"If you are looking to learn about the history of the Jews and Hebrew writings, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU!! If your into FICTION, then this might be of intrest to you.There is no dought that this book has nothing to do with the book spoken in the Bible as the Book of Jasher."
5,Great Price! and VERY Easy to apply!,"As stated in other reviews i was a little surprised you had to get them wet and then apply them. I decided to go ahead and give it a try. It couldnt of been easier. Get em wet and stick where you want, simple as that! they look great too, many people think i spent alot of time painting these onto my wall lol. I thought they might end up drying rough but they dont. I have had them on my walls for a week now with no problems.Use them on other Things! crafts+Kids=FUN (or trouble lol)I used the butterfly wallies to put on my lamp shade, it took me 10 mins and it looks like i bought it that way. I ordered a couple different wallie designs. My niece and I painted my dogs toy chest lol lol and then used wallies to decorate it. My niece had a blast and the toy chest actually matches my decor now lolTheir are way more wallie designs available and plenty of decorating ideas, craft projects, and tips. Go to their Website [...]"
1,Not worth the price.,"Looks okay when your done, but not worth the effort to achive the look. Do NOT soak for 1 minute as stated, the glue will come of and your left with paper... Because of the edges you have to hold each piece for ever until it sticks."
1,Wallies Cutout DragonFlies,"The ""glue"" does not activate when placed in water. The cutouts fall off the wall when they dry. Very disappointed!"
3,"Beautiful Result, slightly more labor-intensive than I expected!","I absolutely love how my wallies turned out. I purchased these dragonflies along with butterflies and large flowers to decorate my baby-girl's nursery. Again, I love how they turned out - very beautiful. But, they were more labor-intensive than the instructions make them out to be. You really need two people to do these. And, you have to keep up with all the water streaming down the walls while you're applying them. It's so not a huge deal - they're still great - but just be forewarned that it takes some work. WARNING: These dragonflies are very little and delicate. With Wallies it seems the smaller the piece the harder it is to apply easily - so these dragonflies will take you a little longer to position and apply nicely. Great product, high quality and good price!"
3,maybe a bad batch?,"After reading all of the reviews I think maybe I got a bad batch, because about every other one has the sticky glue on it and the others not. So I am having to hold those on for a long time until they sort of dry, and then when I see them later they are not fdried flat against the wall and I feel they will fall off at any time.Has anyone else experienced this? Should I order another batch maybe?"
2,OK but ....,"Well...I have read this book and I enjoyed it very much. But I think you sould like borrow it from a friend not buy it if you are a person under like 8. Because it's too easy to read and it takes like less than 2 min. to read the whole book. I mean,why do you buy a book u have been dying to get and get thriled for 2 min. and forget about it! Anyway,lucky this book I rated it 2 stars. Because of a locket! And the price is not just worth it and this book is not the kind of book Mary Kate and Ashely would write.So if you want a book with MK&A's humor,jet a book like Two of a Kind #1 It's a Twin Thing. You would wnt the rest of the series!"
5,excellent travel bag,"I am travelling to India next month and needed a good travel bag for my newly bought taylormade set.I own a cart bag and 46"" driver along with other clubs.I got the travel bag today and its so spacious and light in weight.great quality and style.I rate it as an excellent buy."
4,"The ""Vault"" Hard Case for Golf Clubs","Quality item. Item shipped on time with no problems. Be sure to give yourself two weeks before you need it. Might be able to get similar item cheaper if you don't care about the padding, which you could probably glue in yourself. Expensive, but worth it if you have really nice clubs that you want to protect with no worries. Also has TSA approved locks, which I found to be a plus."
2,Don't waste your money.,"Includes a natural raffia grass skirt (tiny, and thin, I had to buy another one and use two), tropical print bikini top (ugly and made for busty women), shell necklace (ordinary, already had one), and a flower hair accessory (ugly and cheap).Don't waste your money, you get what you pay for."
4,Quirky new jazz/pop voice,"Here's a distinctive new voice, a Dane who sings in English and writes her own songs. Her associates are fine jazz musicians, as yet unknown outside Scandinavia. Her lyrics are quirky and sometimes surreal, thoroughly modern in a jazz/pop vein. The song Cuban Cigars is highly amusing, and Our Time Will Come and others are melodious. The backings feature grand piano, flugelhorn and other mellow sounds."
5,"scholarly, but lay-friendly commentary","Very clear, and not ""fluffy"" Bible commentary. True to Reformed theology and expository in nature as the description suggests. A good support to Bible study."
2,Esther and Ruth,This book did not add anything new to the discussion on Esther. Duguid gave the standard simplistic explanation of protraying her asa heroine as oppose the fact that she also broke some of God's law. I would have like a little more background and for the author to be realistic. There are better commentaries on Esther and Ruth out there.
3,height?,but how tall is it? it says 38.5 x 17 x 1.8 inches. so please tell me this isnt but 2 inches tall?
3,Not very durable,"I bought this a year ago to organize all our construction paper and colored paper in our homeschool area. It was easy to put together (comes flat packed) and the paper fit well. However, after a year of steady use, it's turned out to be not very durable. It's leaning quite a bit to one side and some of the shelves are bowed and warped from the weight of the paper on the shelf. The shelves are single thicknesses of corrugated cardboard, so it doesn't take much to warp them. This year I'm biting the bullet and buying a more sturdy version."
5,Great paper organizer for classroom or office,"It's simple. It's slotted. It has the space for your colored paper for art projects or special fliers via photocopying. Better yet, we use it for the various information sheets we give our students in our office; it makes it easy to see what you are looking for & easier yet to see what you're running low on. It really is great for a classroom environment or the office. Easy to assemble, made out of sturdy cardboard. Ships easily. Overall, a simple solution at a reasonable price. And heck, we've had the first two we bought for several years now and they are holding up just fine. Cheers!"
3,its card board but i like it,I like this was surprise when it cam in fast delivery but when bought it I thought it was wood for some reason neither here or there it will be put in use
1,very disappointed,"In looking at the picture, the product looks much sturdier than the actual product. It is very flimsy cardboard and does not support heavier paper. Very disappointed!"
2,BEWARE:Textbook contains dated information,"I have been using this textbook for four semesters with undergraduates obtaining a minor in health education and am frustrated with the information that is outdated and full of errors. I will no longer be using the text in my courses. The food pyramid is wrong, exercise theories are incorrect, etc. My exercise science majors this past semester were disgusted with the mistakes. The author's website is decent and consideration should be given to write a shorter textbook with concise updated information. I am now teaching this course without a textbook.PatAssociate Professor Health EducationMassachusetts Private College"
1,Can't judge THIS book by it's cover!!,"Beware buyers!! This collection may have EC's picture on the cover but he no play the music!! Sounds like Chuck Berry meets Paul Revere and the Raiders meets every 60's garage band you ever heard. It is all ...disguised blues tunes played by who knows? There are no liner notes with this package, only EC's picture and song titles. Produced in England ...) and packaged under 'Dressed To Kill' record label. ...I am a big fan of the blues but, this was a MAJOR disappointment. There are alot of good songs on this package..."
1,What was he thinking?,"Eric, me boyo, Why did you put your name to this waste of time? The pieces on this album, though purportedly a colection of your best work, sound.....shallow. Thin. Just plain long not good. Somebody made some money on this turkey. I was forced to give this a 1 star rating. That is too much for it. I really hope this one got in under your radar as I am sure such a talented musician as yourself would never have let this thing see the light of day"
1,This CD is a ripoff,"If you want to hear vintage Clapton, do not buy this CD. Ol' Eric is hard to find on this deceptively labeled product. Mostly what you get are poorly recorded and mixed Yardbirds tunes. The drums dominate, followed by bass and vocals. Clapton is hard to hear or simply not there. There are no liner notes so the guitarist isn't even identified. Buyer beware!"
5,Always a good product,Used this tape many times over the years and it does what they say.Recently installed a cat-back system on my Jeep and the pipe was pretty close to my shock.Wrapped some of this tape around the shock where it seems close to the exhaust and my shock oil should be alright.
3,It's OK,"This is a good outer covering for a header wrap, however, it is not that pliable and will kink around tight bends. The glue in a few section of the tape did not stick very well."
2,poor instruction,"this workout had potential, thus the 2 stars and not one, but the instructor has an arrogant edge and does not see to be interested in teaching as much as she is interested in being on camera...i don't know, this routine was ok, but the overall production did not make me comfortable; this a trade away dvd."
4,Skinny Skinny,"Nowadays Skinny just aint snappin to his full potential. This was it though. The beats were straight but his flow was what made this album. that was rare for memphis rap at the time. get this and king of the playaz ball. after that, skinny got on that talking flow that he does today. its annoying because you know he could do better and he just talking over a beat basically to say he put out an album."
1,Edited review,"Skinny Pimp has to be the most repetitive rapper in the industry. Don't waste your money. He should stop talking trash about Three 6, because he's not any better. You know why he's an ""underground"" artist? BECAUSE HE [is bad]."
2,Two times is enough,"I liked the first one but the second Tin Machine CD shows a band out of ideas. The band is solid and Bowie is really trying to sell the songs, but these songs need so much work it is beyond Bowie's power to breathe life into them. Not one memorable track on this one. A driving beat cannot sell a song that is intellectually vacant (unless you're trying to dance to it) especially when sung by one of the more creative minds in rock. The Machine wisely finished up after this effort. Too bad the promise of the first CD could not have lead to a more provocative career for this band."
5,Excellent book!,"This book goes right to the core of healthy, long-term weight loss. Diets don't work and Jill not only tells us why, but tells us what does. In an easy to understand format, she explains how the weight loss process is all about simple choices - that we make for ourselves. This book offers the truth, and it's a refreshing change from fad diets. I fully recommend it.Stephen Moss CPT, LWMC,Author of : Lose Weight with The Power of One: A Motivational Journey to Nutritional Sanity."
4,Enjoyable and Reaffirming,"No gimmicks, no magic or overnight release of excess weight. Ms. Fleming simply offers a methodical, commonsense approach to what we consume. As a food addict, my ability to remain fit and trim can be challenging. Though not all of Ms. Fleming's suggestions work for me, I found this book to be an enjoyable read and motivational to keep the pounds from reappearing."
2,The Bar-Kays have had it,"As has been said many times before, even great artists can overstay themselves. At the time that this album was made, the Bar-Kays had sustained a successful 20+ year recording career despite some hardships in the group's early years. However, even the best funk bands were starting to run out of fresh ideas towards the end of the 80s, and such is definitely the case with this 1994 album. With no standout tracks, this album pales in comparison to the earlier, classic material of The Bar-Kays, and doesn't even sound that good compared to many lesser artists of that period. They attempted a comeback in 2003, but it was pretty much ignored."
3,Heat Barriers,"I tried to install them on a heat shield that I made for a Coleman Golf Cart Heater, but the adhesive wouldn't stick. It apparently got to hot and peeled off. So I don't think it is as good as some people have said. I think the insulation part does it's job, but the adhesive is marginal."
4,High Priced,This stuff isn't cheap. Then again you shouldn't need a lot. I'll know at the end of a few races if it really works.
5,Worked Great Fro What I Needed It For,I needed the product to protect three relays under the hood of my vehicle. The heat shield was easy to cut and work with and solved the problem of over heating the relays from overheating. The adhesive backing was a nice touch and is very sticky.
2,"Great for looks, doesn't stand up to pressure","I was hoping I could use this as a temporary fix for an exhaust hose in my boat, I wrapped the breached hose with the product, within 2 minutes of operation, the wrap burst sending metalic shards into my engine compartment, this definitely is not able to stand up to any sort of pressure."
2,Breeches pill - not good for showing,"I bought these for a show a few weeks ago and man they looked perfect! Fit great and were very comfortable. However, after wearing them for approximately one hour the breeches started pilling around the top line of my tall boots. After washing them they now have pilled all over and look terrible. Needless to say they are now schooling breeches. Still comfortable but the quality of these is not great."
3,Peridot gemstone bracelet,"The gemstones are very nice quality and color, however the silver work is not perfect. I returned this item because one the the joints where silver is linked together was not attached properly and I was afraid it might break."
5,Killer Cardigans style alt pop rock,"I don't wanna be too lengthy,just wanna say that this EP (6 songs) is worth every penny. Be on the lookout for this band, cuz I think they're gonna be huge one of these days. Well, like I said I wanna keep it short so there you have it."
5,This Band Rawks,I heard about this band from some friends of mine on AOL and decided to check them out. Man - these people know what music is all about. I'd love to see them on MTV instead of a lot of the junk bands they have now. Go Lily's Siren
5,Music Has Just Got Better,"I didn't feel that 02 was a very good year for music, especially Pop. But, after hearing Lily's Siren, I see 03 as a big year. They need to get off of AOL and on to MTV and Billboard. These people know what music is all about. If they have more like they put on AOL, then they will definetly be up for album of the year. They're all about what is popular with Pop. I really like their blended harmonies. They seem to be able to put it together on every song. I've ordered their EP from Amazon. It will be among my faves."
2,Why did he play with the knife?,"I usually like Christina Dodd's books but this one left me unsatisfied and frustrated.Why did Jude feel the need to play with the knife in Caroline's bedchamber? To show off his masculinity? That particular tidbit did not add anything to the scene.Their romance seems forced to me, somehow.Also, the twist at the end - what the heck is that? Ms. Dodd might have wanted it to be happy ending but I can do without it."
1,Two reasons not to buy,"The first reason being that this is a REPRINT. First published in 2005.The second reason is that this is a very poor book. I used to think that Christina Dodd was a good writer but now her plots are just silly and the writing is poor. This book is no exception; it supposedly involves members of the British upper class during the Victorian era but they ""speak"" like members of the uneducated poor and the plot is farcical."
5,"""Taking his hands, she wrapped them around the bars on the headboard.""",This was a great historical mystery/romance novel. This is another novel of the Distinguished Academy of Governesses series. Caroline Ritter was the toast of the season until a married man drugged her and attacked her at a ball. She was made out to the bad person and now needs a job to support herself - since her father threw her out of her home. She takes on a job with the Academy of Governesses and becomes governesses for the Duke son. She is to teach him how to flirt and find a perfect bride. Of course everything is not has in seems - therefore a perfect book!
3,Plot got in the way of romance,"Beautiful but ruined heroine teaches foppish hero how to flirt with appropriate debutante per his dad's orders. Their flirting gets personal. In the meantime, Hero works undercover to find proof of the men who's responsible for his older brother's death.This Dodd book could've been better. This wasn't as tightly-written as other Dodd books like Just The Way You Are, Close to You, and My Favorite Bride. The action-mystery interfered with Hero & heroine's sexual chemistry. Romance became more of focal point towards 3/4 of book. Love scenes were good but didn't occur later in book.Partially recommended."
1,Not even fair...,This is my first book my Ms Dodd and I wish I had never read it. It was really hard for me to get through it. I found it to be boring and silly.The plot was odd and hard to follow. The characters were bland. And the love scenes had no romance in them.I have a couple of other books from this author and I don't even want to read them.
1,"No MP3, NO BUYEE","I AIN'T GETTING A SINGLE THING OFF OF THIS ALBUM UNLESS I CAN DOWNLOAD IT, INSTANTLY. NUF SAID, OVER AND OUT."
4,Not Bad for the price,"if you are a pro looking to take perfect shots, keep looking but if you enjoy widlife photography as a hobby or moon shots this is the lens for you. You will need a good tripod or someplace steady to rest the lens on but for fun this gives you a long reach for a great price."
5,Great step workout,I love this step aerobic workout. Gilad really works you in this dvd. It is not too short and not too long. I use it every week.
4,Gilad Step Aerobics,I have most of Gilad's aerobic tapes and DVD's but never did his Step. I have to admit this is the BEST Step Aerobic DVD I have ever done. You get a complete workout.
3,Dated but effective,I was looking for a refresher on Step Areobics. This DVD is a good work out and has a lot of different steps. I found Gilad annoying and the music is awful. I muted it and played my own dance music.Overall it met my needs and my expectations.
4,Good Work Out,"I used to do Gilad's workouts in the early '90s. I haven't done step aerobics since '97. I think the workout is intermediate. It may be a little hard for a beginner to follow if they don't know the steps, but Gilad does break it down into three segments. The DVD has the option to chose the segments you want to do. I loved the workout! It was just right for me. Because of the repetition and the increase in pace, I received a full workout. I also loved that there was an ab workout at the end."
2,Kinda lame,"I am fairly young and like step aerobics, I read a number of reviews before purchasing this video that stated it was one of the best step aerobic routines. IT'S NOT. As if it's not obvious by the cover that the video is totally 80's. I didn't think it would matter too much, a good work out is a good work out. But all the 80's jargon throughout the video is way too much. Plus the work out itself is way too slow, even when I did the entire video straight through, I felt I needed to go for a run and try to get some real cardio in before moving to weights."
2,very very basic,"if you've stepped before, you'll find this too basic and it gets very boring very quickly. watching 80's clothes was entertaining though."
2,Very basic,"If you're used to Les Mills-style step aerobics with very intense speed-stepping and harder, longer cardio segments, this DVD will disappoint you. It's fine for beginners or those looking to get back in shape after a long hiatus, but it's not very challenging if you're used to intense hour-long step classes."
2,Too many changes,"I loved Gilad from watching him on ESPN and LOVE the beach scenes. However, I felt like he went too fast; I was playing catch-up because he switched from one thing to another very quickly. There weren't a lot of repeats before moving on to something new. Maybe if I did it more and got used to it, I wouldn't mind. However, I much prefer my Kathy Smith and Cathe videos. This one is just collecting dust for me right now. Maybe I'll give it a try another time, but I regret buying it."
4,beginner who bought this DVD by mistake,"I didn't read the information in detail and didn't know that this DVD was for intermediate to advance level. But still it's great. Te movements are not complicated even for a beginner like me. So I started with one sequence a day. For beginners (especially those who are not physically fit) one sequence a day is enough for a start. I intend to get used to one sequence a day program of my own and then increase the time. The main workout part is divided into 3 sequences so it is easy to choose one, two or all three parts according to your body's capacity. The movements look simple but when you actually follow them, it is a highly effective exercise. So even as a beginner, I still like it a lot."
1,Gilad- no way!,"I really did not like this at all. The moves are so simple it gets very boring, boring, boring. Gilad has a very barky and annoying voice and I could barely even watch it let alone do it. I am sure it is a good workout if his voice doesnt put you off, but the steps are so incredibly basic. His voice so obtrusive and unattractive - I couldnt stand to listen to it. It might be half okay with the sound off but even then, you would need to not want any sort of challenge with your stepping moves."
2,Boring,"Bought this item as I needed some new variety to include in my fitness program.I could only do this program once and I know I'm not going to do it again.The program has a very few basic steps and a few step combinations which are repeated many, many, many times each. I thought it was boringIt does something for your resistance but, I have better programs with better music, moves and fun for the same level of effort"
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I've tried this DVD several times and it has WAY to many different moves involved. I'm trying to exercise and lose weight and I've been doing Step Aerobics on and off for 10 years. But I find I can't keep up with all the ever changing moves by Gilad. Just when I get it down he's moved on, and arms are going one way, feet another, knees over there, now hop!?!? What? It doesn't have to be that complicated to be effective. I don't recommend this DVD for beginners. However I do recommend Step Aerobics in general, there's no beating the workout you get."
3,too basic,I like the video for beginners but the problem is I'M not a beginner. I thought when reading the reviews this was a moderately complex routine but its REALLY basic. Also the music is not that great either. It does make you sweat and offers a good workout and the beach scene is nice so if you are just starting out with step or need a simple routine then this is for you but I bore easily and prefer a more complex high energy workout.
2,Step Aerobics,"Being a senior citizen, this has not been all that beneficial to me. I have an old Jane Fonda step aerobics which I prefer."
3,Okay,It is a little dated... the explainations are okay but I have other videos that I purchased that are much better
5,Far more here than you might expect!,"If you want Captain Blood or Robin Hood, give it a miss. If you want incredibly lovely Korngold music that will stay in your player for days, go for it. I don't understand it, but this is music that you can chew on in spite of it's ""medium"" intensity throughout. I love it. I've bought two copies, the second after the first developed issues from a scratch. Korngold will fool you with his simple romantic nature that suddendly yields sophistication beyond all expectations."
2,As much as I love Korngold....,"This CD simply puts me to sleep. 70 minutes of film music that jumps in between dialogue about the Bronte's. If this is your cup of tea, then I will say that it is recorded well. But oh for some modern day producer who understood how to make movie soundtracks. Most of the composers are dead, and even many of their heirs. Erich Korngold would never have produced his music this way. Nowadays, nobody knows, so they just release as much of it as they can. But it's not like an opera or ballet score where every cue has a thematic connection or a musical purpose. A lot of this is just 'filler'. Of course it's Korngold filler, so some may be interested. But, well, we knew he could orchestrate didn't we?This might have made an great 20 or 30 minute suite. Musically speaking, it's just kind of boring as it stands now."
1,cutical trimmer,"Well this can be a long story but I choose to make it short; I ordered TWO of these and got ONE.After writting 4 emails to customer service and receiving NOTHING back from Cosmetic Solutions I just let it go. By the time you dispute charges, send them a reason why and everything else combined in a issue such as this its not worth it.I think they cost something like 1.99 each and the shipping was higher than both.I expect this ONE I got to break any day, the craftsmanship of it is weak and the tip is thin metal."
4,Disturbing,"Having never even read Jean Cocteau's poetry, I was completely unprepared for this disturbing story. It starts out innocently enough, with a childhood snowball fight, but the reader is soon enveloped in the fantasy world created by Paul and his sister Elisabeth. But as they grow older, and their competing magnetic personalities enslave their friends, they find themselves almost completely removed from reality and heading toward disaster. Paul and Elisabeth and neither likable or unlikable...they seem to be completely above our likes and dislikes.This book is a fairly quick and easy read, but it's still rich in its language and with unforgettable characters. It should also appeal to a wide range of readers. Anyone who enjoys French literature, psychological drama, Shakespearean tragedies, or fantasy fiction will really enjoy this book."
2,Pretentious,"Les Enfants terribles, by Jean Cocteau I would characterize by the question: ""How can I write a psychological drama which would make me look deep and artistic?"". I think the author was involved in his own vanity to the extent that he came up with a very immature work. Don't get me wrong: I like psychologically intense works, that go deep into the human soul, but here it just feels forced, and most of all it is not well written. It doesn't flow, just feels pretentious."
3,This is not Enfant Terribles - but a play from 1940,I am sorry to disappoint buth the volume listed here is Les Monstres Sacres - a play in 3 acts by Cocteau from 1940 and not the famous novel. It is one of Cocteau's less exciting pieces - a wordy parlour play - his attempt at a comedy of manners. Doesn't quite have that bite.
5,"Buy this one and then go get all his other books, too!",I have followed this author's writing career since he started and have enjoyed each and every read. Each of his book provides a look into the past from point of view yet to be discovered. The Case of the Ripper's Revenge again returns the reader to a historic moment in time and permits an insider's view of what happened and what might have happened. A real page turner-kudos Mr. McCarver!
5,Wonderful DVD,"I use this with my kindergarten Sunday School class. At the end of class, I put on the video that accompanies the day's lesson and let them watch it while they color. They get so involved they don't want to leave when the parents come to get them. The children's Bible that goes with it is worth getting to use them together. I would say that this video is perfect for pre-k to about 2nd grade. It may be too simple for older children, though I have had older children sit and watch with the little ones. The DVD covers all the major Bible stories. The animation is really cute. A great Bible teaching tool."
2,There are no ghosts....,"Ok, I am the hugest skiny puppy/ohgr/download/doubting thomas/tear garden etc. fan there is... But cEvin Key has yet to impress me. Music for Cats was really dissapointing and although The Ghost Of Each Room is a lot more tolerable, It still doesn't grab me the way other stuff he works on does. Don't get me wrong, cevin Key is great! but his solo stuff isn't really there... I mean Frozen Sky is incredible.. Ogre is great on it and the music is so gooood. But some of the album is just eh... I still have hopes for him though. If you are an avid puppy fan, get this cd. It's mediocre but it adds to your collection, otherwise I don't know. I am just one person, and this is just one opinion. Make up what you like of this cd..."
4,Definitely not filler . . ..,"This is not by far my favorite, but it has some shining good points. The first episode will have you rolling on the floor laughing--A blatant parody of the Power Rangers series, featuring Amelia and Gourry as would-be heroes after they stumble onto the village of Justice. This episode also reunites the scattered cast--Lina, Zelgadis, Flia, Gourry, Amelia and Xellos, who were scattered after the fourth volume. This tape furthers the plot immensely, introducing two new characters--Sirius and Erulogos, two Gods from the Overworld who are on a mission to destroy Darkstar. Also features Jilas prominently--Some of these scenes are incredibly sweet! I reccomend this one for sure!"
2,Where's the chicks?!?!,"It wouldn't be G&S if not for the ladies - so where are they? How could they leave out Mabel's aria - or Josephine's!? The only female aria included on this disc comes from Mikado, which is the least exciting (if G&S could be un-exciting) of the three! Everything else on the recording is great, but I am still quite disappointed."
4,A contemporary fable of good vs. evil.,"In a world that stands on the brink of the millenium, facing an uncertain future, Theophany offers the reader a realistic picture of what might happen if a real life prophet presented herself to our modern world. Mike Vines paints an evocative and endearing protagonist in Sarah, who was chosen before birth to reveal to the world a stunningly simple, and well thought out spiritual message. Vines paints a vivid portrait of Sarah, never letting the reader forget that she is, in spite of the angels that accompany her on her journeyt, ahuman girl. While Sarah's nemesis, ""The Stranger"" seems a bit cardboard, Vines manages to present a charasmatic and frightening portrait of evil unleashed in human form on an unsuspecting world. For any one who has ever wondered why so many prayers seemingly go unanswered, Theophany will present a wonderfully simple and heartfelt ray of hope in what sometimes seems to be an increasingly bleak world."
5,"Heart-Warming, Thought-Provoking","This is heart-warming story of a child prophet, Sarah, and the miracles she inspires.What I enjoy most though,is that the author goes beyond heart-warming to examine some of lifes greatest questions: Why do bad things happen to good people?, Why me?, and Is there a God?. through the story of Sarah, Mr. Vines answers these questions with simple explanations that ring true.This book should be a made for TV movie or be adapted to the big screen."
4,Theophany--soulfighting at its finest,"Theophany is a riveting book that takes a basic tenet of Christian belief, that God will return to take care of His flock, and turns it on its head. The reader follows the heroine of the story as she answers the call of God and is in turn fair game for the forces of evil. Author Vines creates a story that is both at once good reading and great entertainment. Filled with twists and turns, the reader is left wondering what the final scenario will be...just which side is the side that will win..and what side the sides actually are!"
2,Great While it Lasted,"This stool was awesome. The height adjustability is nice, and it has a great range of motion.However, after only about four months of use it has died. Where the leg meets the base, the base tore open and it won't stay upright now.Alas. If this looks appealing to you, I'd recommend going for something more robust."
4,Short visual history of Russian architecture,"It is a short but richly illustrated introduction into the history of Russian architecture. Russian architecture is an expression of dramatic historic struggle of Russian people for the preservation of their national identity and demonstration of the creative development of their Eastern Orthodox culture under the constant pressure of aliened Western culture during periodical waves of Russian modernization. Unfortunately, the dramatism of this struggle and strong capacities of Russian architecture for creative adoptation is not well described in the accompanied text. It is a very good but not exciting book."

I am proud of Mr. Cummings for telling his story. Like you wrote in my book, May the creator bless you. With alot respect and honor from the southwest. Thank you for sharing your story.

4,Very good for new CS students,"This is an introductory CS book disguised as a python book. If you are a seasoned programmer looking to use python for advanced practical stuff, then you may want to try one of the other python references. However if you are somehwat new to CS, or are looking for a book that teaches CS principles, focusing on the fundamentals of the field instead of a reference lookup text then this is a very easy to digest book. It focuses on algorithm development and other important underlying concepts that many other references assume you already know.This is a fantastic book with lots of good ""quick hitter"" excercises to nail home the concepts. I highly recommend this book for newcomers."
5,Great for people outside the Computer Science field,"This book was my introduction to both Computer Science and Python. The nice thing about it is to start learning a programming language while assimilating the basic concepts and the proper reasoning required for the task.The exercises at the end of each chapter are essential if you want to really get accustomed to the concepts, although I think you could just read most part of the book first to get a general idea and then try all the exercises.Although the book covers Python 2.4, I didn't have any problem applying the new knowledge to Python 2.6.My only complaint is the size of the book: as a student book, it has large margins. I'm a huge fan of small books... Anyway, the margins can be very useful if you write lots of side-notes on your books.A new edition covering Python 3.0 is not strictly necessary right now, but I hope they keep coming, as I prefer this book over Mark Lutz' ""Learning Python""."
5,Possibly the perfect intro to CompSci Textbook,"As a young professional programmer who has never taken a CompSci class of any kind I have quite a fondness for intro books as they tend to 'fill in the gaps'/ stroke my ego. Thus I've read a LOT of intro to CompSci books most of have been rather awful. This book however, is simply not one of them.The books small size, approachable language, excellent examples and Socratic pedagogical orientation in addition to the authors seemingly effortless lucidity is enough to drop any jaw.If we were to be critical, we should perhaps ask the author to show greater concern for data casting. Python is a loosely casted language and thus this important concept takes a back seat.Nonetheless for the books scope (a first course in Computer Science) I can not imagine and have yet to read a better primmer."
4,Good for beginners,"This book provides the knowledge of programming in an easy to learn format. Good for beginning programmers, however it is very basic and does not cover any advanced topics in any way. The book is really good for a first-time programmer, however I would not recommend it as a Python resource for anybody with previous programming experience. One major drawback of the book is that it does not provide answers or any other form of solution to the chapter-end questions."
5,Absolutely the best book for learning Python,"I have several Python programming books and scores of printed out online tutorials and documentation. This one is the best of the bunch (with the Absolute Beginner title coming in 2nd) because it explains everything a beginning programmer needs to know and has enough exercises and challenges to make it interesting. A lot of the other titles jump right in and seem kind of haphazard in their approach. This one builds topic upon topic, using what was learned previously to help tackle the next area. An excellent book!"
5,Good introductory material,"This book claims to introduce key ideas in programming, not only to teach Python language, and I think it is very successful in doing that. It is somewhat ""chronological"". I am a beginner in programming and I am learning a lot from this book. It has introductory material so it might not be of interest to those who already have some knowledge in the subject."
4,Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science,"This is the best introduction of Python I've found so far. It has many examples and exercises which are helpful in the development of Python programming skills. However, it is still a little random in helping new programmers."
3,Not Bad,"I received this pen the other day. Not to bad, however wish it would have come with a black ink instead of a blue ink. For the most part its a good pen, but it is better suited for amature/daily use writers."
4,Good pen...,"Got this as a beginner fountain pen. Writes well enough and the grip fits my hands in a nice way. The only downside I noticed was the seemingly weightless nature of the pen. When you think fountain pen I suppose you expect some kind of heft from the thing. Aside from that one trait, its a great pen."
4,Fine Is Too Thick!!!,"Just received this pen(Lamy Safari, Fine) in the mail. Did some quick testing, found that FINE is WAY too thick for my taste. Will either have to buy the extra fine nib or an entire pen with the extra fin nib.Also found the ink(blue) in the stock tube to be a bit too light. Not really a big problem, since I bought the refillable tube along with the Noodler's waterproof ink. Hope that will work out.Other than that, the pen is fine--it writes very smoothly."
4,First fountain pen,"Very tough pen. This is my first fountain pen and I love it. I ordered black ink for it because I dont like blue ink and am very happy with it. I needed a pen that could sign checks over $10,000 and using this pen I now feel like I'm that rich. Will buy again with black ink"
5,"New to fountains, exactly what I needed.","First fountain pen and it's just what I was looking for. It was a little ""scratchy"" at first, but after writing for 5 minutes it smoothed out and the ink started flowing better.Can't go wrong with this pen for the price."
4,Good pen,"This is a good pen. It looks and feels nice, but the things holding the nib on broke after 4 weeks or so."
3,"Nice, everyday pen",Awesome everyday pen and writes effortlessly. Only thing that is a downfall is that the cartridges run out quickly. Buy a 5 pack of Parker refills and keep them on you.
3,Good for a few months,"I've had this pen for 11 months, and after a couple of them, it required too much maintenance (cleaning) to perform well. I've tried cheap (under $12 dollars) and expensive ink (over $18 dollars) on it, and I have to constantly prime it to get it working. In addition, it's feels more of a medium to bold nib than fine...and it uses too much ink for my liking. Save your money, and spend twice as much money, and you'll be a much happier writer. :)"
4,pen review,"I love fountain pens. This pen is good for an everyday pen, but does not deliver on the fine writing experience of some of the other fountain pens I have used. It is extremely light weight, which is wonderful if you prefer that, however, I prefer a pen with a little more heft to it. I would compare it more to the writing experience of a roller ball pen than I would to the other fountains I have."
4,Very good pen,"When i first got this fountain pen i was surprised by how smooth it wrote for the price. The only problem is you have to find a perfect angle to write with it, if not, its not very smooth although its still is smoother than my parker sonnet rollerball; this may be because im left handed. Another thing that surprised me was the build quality. Even though this fountain pen is made out of ABS plastic, it feels sturdier and less fragile than a metal pen and the clip on the pen also feels very sturdy and doesnt seem like it will break any time soon. Also, another good thing i noticed is that the pen will write immediatly even after it has been capped for several days unlike some other fountain pens i have owned.The only reason i gave it a 4 star instead of 5 stars is the somewhat wierd angle i have to hold it so that it writes smooth, again, probably because im left handed."
4,Great Pen,I purchased the Safari earlier this year. It is a great starting pen for those looking into bringing back the fountain pen. The pen writes like a dream and when paired with goo.gl/wzezl and a bottle of ink works like a dream.
5,Feels so good,"This pen feels so good to write with, I feel like I'm doing something morally wrong.Pros: feels great, and gives you the pleasure of refilling your own pen (with purchase of the refill converter)Cons: makes ballpoint pens feel like garbage"
5,A Fine Choice,"I received the pen as a gift not long ago. Immediately I loved it. Without the cap, the pen is nearly weightless and a pleasure to put to paper. I found myself playing with it quite often.Only one down side, about a week and a half later, I noticed the paint at the top of the clip had chipped up a little. My girlfriend and I had heard nothing of this in any reviews, so we contacted LAMY. It was replaced immediately (received it 4 days after my email) completely free of charge."
1,"Heavy user of fountain pens, this one sucks",I am heavy user of fountain pens. That means I use them almost all the time every day for the bulk of my work. I bought this Lamy and it is sheer garbage. After 7 months the nib broke leaving me with nothing. I can't recommend this pen for anything other than light occasional usage or for someone who just signs checks.
3,Fountain pen reviews.,"I'm puzzled by reviews and ""product details"". Why is the most important thing about a fountain pen never mentioned or shown -- flexibility and a sample of the writing done with it? And the feel of the pen -- is it hard throughout, or does it have the textury no-slip surface so many have these days? Is the grip contoured, showing the novice how it shd be held, or does the pen leave that to the one writing with it to adapt that to his preferences? How big is it? How much does it weigh?"
5,Worried at first. But extremely satisfied!!,"I must say, as soon as this pen arrived at my stoop I was eager to open it and test it out. But my intial reaction was disappointment rather than excitement.The pen didn't write as well as people said it did right out of the box. It would go a few inches without much ink flowing to the nib, resulting in an imprint on the paper rather than ink. But as time went on, I grew more and more excited about using it.After a few hours it began to write like a dream. Smooth and nice. Perfect. I plan on buying some ink cartridges soon.I don't see any reason as to why you should buy anything else in this price range. Its awesome."
3,Lamy Safari Fountain Pen - Charcoal - Fine,"Found this pen to be OK, but a bit scratchy to write with compared to other fountain pens I have used.It is comfortable to hold."
3,"nice feel, but uneven writing","This is my first fountain pen. It feels good in my hand and the writing is smooth, but it doesn't write evenly. I sometimes have to go back and fill in a spot where no ink was applied (I'm not writing fast or pressing down too hard, either). I guess that I should expect top quality given the price."
5,Absolute best fountanin pen for the price,"This is my first fountain pen that i have even owned and i have to say i am very impressed. The pen casing is made of plastic but its very very tough (impossible to bend). The nib is very good quality with and writes smoothly with a constant ink flow. The pen has cartridges for ink refills but you can buy a converter for your own ink. Really the only complaint i have is not about the pen but the ink, it's not waterproof. However this problem can be easily overcome by purchasing some waterproof ink."
5,"Finally, Affordable Excellence","I'm a pen lover, and was a little leary of this pen, it being plastic and all. But the feel of it is quite ergonomic. And, most importantly, you can leave it unused for weeks at a time and it'll write well with a solid line right out of the gate. I always buy blue so that it is obviously not black laser printing just made to look personalized, and the blue ink is nice. The pen is a little pricy given it's material makeup, but I'm thrilled with it. For some reason, writing with a fountain pen--especially on a good paper--takes me back a couple of centuries and it feels ""real"" again. This pen is terrific, as are most pens from this company."
3,Like my Lami Safari but,"The Lamy Safari is a great pen now. It writes well and has a bit of tooth to it which I like. However, it was not like that of the box. This pen took me a lot of tweaking to get working. It was really scratchy and had terrible ink flow. It took me a lot of googling, tweaking, cleaning, and an ink change to get this thing working correctly. So for how it works now, I give it an A+. However, I'll give this pen 3 stars instead of five because of its out of the box quality."
5,Lamy Fine Point,"This is my most favorite pen. I tried both the extra fine point and this fine point pen, and this one is my favorite. I also love the matte finish on this charcoal pen. All in all, it is my favorite pen to carry and I do have to keep my eyes on it lest it becomes ""lost""."
5,Perfect Pen,Really great pen; light in weight but substantial enough and with a very smooth nib; a joy to write with and very cheap price too. There really are no downsides.
4,"Great fountain pen, inexpensive price",I bought this pen to use at work and have been very pleased with its performance. Its gotten a few second looks due to its clean design and a few questions about where I got it. I'd always been interested in LAMY pens and have found this one to be enjoyable to use. If you're a pen nut (or snob) this pen isn't the smoothest but for the price its great. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to use fountain pens everyday but without having to worry about losing an expensive pen. I have also bought a LAMY Safari pencil since this purchase and have definitely become a fan of this brand. World Lux is a great supplier with an awesome catalog.
1,Lamy Safari Fountain Pen not fit for purpose,"After using the pen (with the black, fine nib) for all my writing for a month, it still skips on almost every downstroke of every character. Also it is so scratchy that I end up with small paper fibers caught in the nib that then makes the writing fuzzy. So I switched to the black extra fine nib. Can't even get an ink flow through that nib, so I have no idea if it writes better. Using good quality paper (Moleskine notebook).A less than $3 Varsity Pilot throw away writes better than the Lamy pen I bought.I notice from other reviews that other purchasers have better experience. That tells me the pen is unreliably manufactured. If yours works great, lucky you and hang onto it. If not, Caveat Emptor."
5,Works Very Well...,"Folks,I've had this item like for ever. I forgot to post a review. Forgive me father, Bezos? The item works very good. I use it to buff out the stainless tubing on the T-Top for my boat in Fort Myers Fl. It works good also on the chrome wheels on my golf cart.The Amazon price was cheaper than anywhere else on the net or especially at brick and mortar stores. I take it apart and throw it in the washing machine in the garage. Yeah, In the garage, that's how its done when you live where it doesn't freeze!Suffer... Northerners (LOL)"
4,Classic,"Quite some time before organic, green, and 'buy local' was part of everyday vocabulary my family owned a copy of this book and my sister and I loved to create things from it. Today many of the products and methods are all the rage. I love the ideas and variations that the book introduces."
4,Great Product!!,The book has alot of neat things to make in your home for cheaper than what you'd pay in the store. Alot more food recipes than I would be in there.
2,Breezy conditions in my area,"These look cool, but are not very heavy. A light breeze will lift the table cloth. If you just want them to hold down a smaller surface (2x3)that would be ok, but not a picnic table."
4,Children's Classic,"A classic kids game, with a Sesame Street twist. My kids love playing this game and Mom loves the characters she grew up with (did I just date myself?)!!! We are currently living overseas and this is one of the small things that we do to keep our kids ""in touch"" with their US peers."
2,I really wanted to like this+,"I read the reviews of this movie, and as a big fan of British comedy, I thought I was going to really like it. I added it to my Netflicks list and just gott it last week. All I can say is that I'm really glad I only rented it.It started out great! David and Peter kind-a reminded me of Del Boy and Rodney from Only Fools and Horses. Then, their kidnap victom came on came on the scene. Long story short, the profanity just got too much, and I simply couldn't finish watching this. I made it to the point where Tracy and Peter found the trapdoor, and that was all I could handle. I really wanted to like this, but its going back to Netflicks tomorrow. If the language doesn't bother you, though, I'm sure you'll enjoy this."
1,The Cottage,"Please save your money!!! This movie was described, written, and performed very poorly!!! This was suppose to be a scary movie with a touch of humor and it was horrible!!! Neither scary nor funny in any capacity!! The preview of this movie is very misleading. Do yourself a favor and just watch the cartoon network!!! This movie was total TRASH!!!!!!"
3,"Finally, good horror comedy...","I usually hate horror comedies, but this one, thanks to the acting, was pretty damn funny..."
4,WordPerfect still unmatched,"I have worked (had to work :-) ) with MS Word, StarWriter, WordStar etc. After almost 20 years of experience I can assure you: Nothing beats WordPerfect when you need a powerful yet easy to use wordprocessor. Don't worry about compatibilty with MS Word. WordPerfect imports and exports Word files just fine. If your primary concern is wordprocessing, get WordPerfect"
5,I love this program,I took classes in Wordperfect 8 and word. Wordperfect is better hands down. I have upgraded to 9 and I now have the full version of 10 with dragon. It has never crashed on me. I have a sony computer that came with 10 because it works so well with xp. I bought the whole version and I will not use word. It is to slow and is terrible for mail merge. The problems that these people are having is becuse they do not know how to use the program. I am also surpised that amozon does not say that it works with xp. Wordperfect 2000 does not work with xp put 2002 does. That is why Sony has it on all of there computers and not word. I am using the professioal ediditon. Sony put the standard with my computer and it work fine.
2,Not so great,"I am afraid this product has left me somewhat underwhelmed. Here are the list of my complaints;After installation, I had to reboot the computer 3 times before all the products worked.Corel presentations destroys all the icons my desktop and startbar each time I start it up.Quattro will not import an Excel spreadsheet it if has a graphic in it. No error message, it just dies. Also, and I don't know whose fault this is, Quattro and Eudora cannot run at the same time.The quick viewer that comes with WPOffice cannot read Quattro files without destroying them.On the other hand, the star of the line-up - WordPerfect, is as solid and useable as always!"
1,Star Office is much much much better,"I tried to do a 500 name mail merge with Word Perfect and my computer crashed. And crashed. I paid their customer service to try and fix it, and the problem got worse, and they really didn't want to spend any time helping me. I wasted about 50 hours of time to try to get it to work, and finally gave up (I work in technology...) This use to be the most awesome software for word processing. Not anymore. Star Office is a dream, and I was so happy to switch to that."
1,says the author misses the point,"I think the author misses the point. It is not bad teachers that are the problem, or even bad school districts, it is the system. For people who don't really know, 99% of school districts are run worse than the DMV. Maybe we should get rid of public schools all-together? He doesn't go into this. He mentions a bad teacher as one with no control of the class. Maybe if those parents enforced proper school conduct at home? Also, unless a teacher is doing things horribly unprofessional, maybe a ""bad teacher"" will be a good learning experience for the kid. He or she will someday have a ""bad boss""."
1,This guy is full of it,"Simply put, this is a vicious diatribe with some assumptions that would make it impossible for any teacher to work with him. Even statement drips with venom yet has little research to back up his sweeping generalizations. I think someone gave his kid a B in elementary school and he's been out for vengeance ever since."
5,This is a good book for people who are wanna-be climbers.,"this is a really great compilation of a bunch of different climbing stories. Real climbers own and read this book. in fact, you can be like them if you read this book. Experience the magic, live the dream."
3,Where's the return to base camp?,"I enjoyed this book, and read it in one day, pouring through the various chapters and one tragedy to the next. My only complaint is that many of the chapters were excerpts from other books, and the stories sometimes felt unfinished. Those excerpts would cover the hit (or near miss) of the summit, then cover some sort of trial to the participating climbers. The climbers may or may not survive the trial, and then that would be the end of it. I actually craved a little bit more of the post-expedition soul-searching."
4,Very Good Game. But Is This Game Meant For You?,"I personally love this game im a big fan of this game and I will admit that it did take me a long time to get use to the menus and understand what to do. If you have a low patience level in video games I suggest you stay away of this title as they have done extremely little from the first title to fix menu clutter etc. The game does have a tutorial but it really misses out alot on the important stuff and you are still left very confused and lost without a paddle. What this game is 5 stars in is the depth of the gameplay, very deep stragegy and there is lots of flexibility. Tons of classes to choose from over 30 in total.Presentation- CGraphics- BSound- BGameplay- B-Lasting Appeal- B"
4,Looking for Oxidados,Oxidados by Plastiling Mosh Latin EMI was lsted in the credits but I cannot find this music anywhere. Anyone have any ideas. Great cut.
2,"Great movie, average soundtrack.",I liked the music in the movie but the soundtrack is vastly different than the movie. A lot of the same thing.
3,The best cut is missing!!!,The best musical cut of the whole movie is when Jane and John are drunk and sensuallly dancing at the beginning of the movie. This cut is played again when Jane is trying to let go of her memories of John as she is preparing to kill him. Does anyone know the name of that cut and the artist who performed that instrumental? It keeps playing hauntingly thru my head.
4,Sound popular overview of research,"A collection of eight essays by recognized scholars in the field, this book provides an overview and interpretation of relevant archaeological work for the non-technical reader. Its popular style makes it well suited for undergraduate classes as well as lay readers unfamiliar with the history of Israel.All of the essays have been revised for this second edition, and most have been significantly expanded. Much has changed since the first edition appeared in 1988, and the revised edition reflects those changes well.The archaeological data and literary evidence available for some periods of Israel's history is far more abundant and diverse than for others. The essays reflect this variation in the available data, and the authors do a competent job of stating the evidence upon which their claims are based."
3,"""Ultimate"" only if you like your opera ""al fresco""!","The music is without question, among the most beautiful ever written. But the quality of the fidelity tells me that many of the selections were recorded live in concert in outdoor venues. I wish that was clear to me before I bought the disc. So, is the music the ultimate? YES! Is the recording the ultimate? NO!"
2,Low Price and Low Quality,"This is an inexpensive, affordable CD, but its recording is old and its sound is not up to the latest standard. I have to admit the price reflects the quality."
5,Never liked opera....try this,"When I was in Lucca, It., the birthplace of Puccini, we attended a concert in a local church that was so beautiful. This CD brought me right back there. A lovely way to spend time listening to Puccini."
5,Eastland Men's Cameron Clog,"I love this comfortable shoes, too bad Eastland discontinued it. Eastland or Amazon, please let me know when you change your mind and get more of this in stock. I'll be glad to pick up another pair or two."
2,"A not exactly ""ultimate"" collection that feels thrown together","I bought this along with the 90th Birthday package as my introduction to Les Paul and Mary Ford, and this is far less interesting than that one. Although you do get the duo's main hits with this collection, the track listing here is heavy on unmemorable blues numbers and other novelties. The strange decision to arrange the 30 tracks on the CD in perfect alphabetical order might have something to do with that as well. I was also very disappointed to find out that this so-called ""ultimate"" collection does not contain any liner notes and only basic songwriting credits. Many of the songs here seem to be obscure album tracks and so locating recording date info for them is very hard. Such a simple thing and yet it's not included.In all, there are better compilations out there and you're not missing anything by skipping this one."
2,Surprised!!!,"I am an avid fan of Anita Bunkley, and I was totally surprised at the writing of this book. Her other books that I have read were excellent!!!. This one is not_not!!! The story line is juvenile, and it makes me wonder if someone else wrote it and she signed on as the author.I am very disappointed in the manner in which she weaved the story line for this awful tale. I only finished the entire story because I thought that a writer of her caliber was going to make it better."
2,This book screams: TAKE ME OUT OF THE LIBRARY!!!!!,This could have been a good story but it was missing that little something that pulls a good story together. This book had too many dry spots so the average reader will not continue this book they will put it down quickly. But I have a pact with myself that every book that I start I will finish until the end. This book took me well over a month to finish. Thumbs down.........
1,Uniquely Horrible,I don't know why someone would do this to a book. I couldn't even finish because it was so incredibly ssssslllllooooowwwww and boring!
2,Story Was Just Okay,"Sara Jane Talbot lost her mother at a young age and she did not have a good relationship with her father. She found a friend in Joyce Ann Keller, or so she thought. It turned out this girl was the wrong person to be around. Choosing Joyce to associate with landed Sara Jane in jail. Once she was released she took the opportunity to begin again - new name, new city, new life.For anyone who's really interested in the business of hair care and cosmetics and the life of a celebrity in the music industry this would probably be an enjoyable read, but for me it was just okay. The only reason I read to the end was to find out what was going to happen between Sara Jane and Joyce Ann.I really enjoyed Bunkley's Balancing Act, though, and I do plan to read more of this author's books."
5,I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,"This was the best novel I've read in a very long time. It really needs to be made into a movie! I could see maybe Halle Berry or Taraji Henson playing the part of Serena/Sara, and Henry Simmons playing the part of Craig Alexander. This was a great book and I had to take it everywhere with me until I finished. I was even reading it in the drive-thru at McDonalds!There were a couple of parts that were a bit unbelievable, but the rest of the book easily made up for that.Highly recommended!!!"
3,It was ok,I read this expecting it to be the bomb but it was not.This book was too long and in some cases boring. I had to skip pages in order to finish this book. I felt as though the author dragged the book out to long.I don't think I will be reading anything by Ms. Bunkley in the near future.
2,Disappointing,"I'm fairly new to Clarks, having only bought one pair previously. But that first pair was very comfortable and I love them! I wore these sandals for one evening and they became very uncomforable and started to cause blisters on my pinkie toes."
4,The Motorized Bike choice wheel thick juicy spokes,"I purchased the pair!, with budget and quality in mind. My wheels came quickly were just perfect for my mock up motorized bike. BuT! the coaster brake arm is going to cause trouble... on a motorized bike if You add on the sprocket (from say a Raw or Skyhawk kit) the distance required to clear the arm for the brake is hard to create. I ruined my chances of using the coaster brake portion. It was only a mock up so I never realized it till this week 4/20/2010... finally this spring April 24th 2010 I re installed the sprocket on the same wheel ""without the arm"". I am going to use pull brakes front and rear and cancel out the coaster brake. I installed one on a plain old 14 gauge Micargi 14 ga wheel the next day with the same problem. the arms don't quite fit right. Just skip the coaster arm and use pull brakes instead, for your safety and long wear otherwise the bearings are ruined in a few hours"
4,Also disagree,"I must say, relating Porter's music to Happy Hardcore couldn't be further from the truth...get your genres right buddy.Although this cd is high-energy and quick-paced, by no means is there a shred of incoherent mixing, it is actually quite the opposite...some of the tighest mixing around, it truly showcases his talent as a dj and producer.It may not be everyone's taste in music, but PorterHouse has always been known as ""the meat of dance music"", which, in my opinion, is exactly what this compilation demonstrates. 26 tracks in 80 minutes, quite impressive to me. Well done."
1,terrible quality,"I bought a replacement filter, it was supposed to last 20,000 gallons, after 900 gallons in a 6 month period of time - it slowed and stopped working. I tried to get help from Crystal Quest and they said it is supposed to last that long, but.. if it doesn't there is nothing they can do about it. Nice to see the manufacturer stands behind their product."
3,"Decent, but I like Lonely Planet better.","Seems like an ok book, but if you don't know Japanese is pretty confusing. The audio files look like a cool thing though. If you can put it on you ipod that would be sweet. I bought the Lonely Planet one and it seems better. A little smaller, clearly organized by colors and easy to understand."
4,Not bad,"Don't know why I really bought this book, because I don't like phrase books.I'm now learning Japanese and I looked at the book again. It uses romanji which is great (compared to some homespun system some phrase books use) and it shows kana/kanji. The choice of vocabulary is also not bad if you are a beginning Japanese student.So as far as phrase books go, this one is pretty useful. But I deduct one star because the book isn't really that essential in the first place."
3,Fit or Fat,There was nothing earth shattering in this book. It is all the same old common sense. Maybe it will motivate you.
4,This info really worked for me.,"This book covers excersize, nutrition/diet and other lifestyle factors in an easy to read format. It explained the reason for doing those things you already know you should be doing. I lost my recently gained menopause pounds really quickly and began to see muscles developing. Nothing else I tried before this had worked for me. This book has sensible info on the subject."
5,Grandmothers are a Gift from God,I showed this book to my wife and she told me to order six copies right away. It is the perfect gift for a grandmother.
2,Poor design,"I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews here. The back wheels are very poorly designed. The bolts stick out really far and my daughter is constantly banging her ankle on it, and ends up crying and throwing her scooter on the ground."
3,"Scooter fine, but the bag/backpack is cheap","My daugher two and half loves the scooter, but the Dora bag/backpack that comes with it is useless. When I unpacked the scooter and put it together,the zipper on the bag didn't work and the strapes look like they were chewed thru, I'm sure it won't last a couple months. Kind of disappointing as she was looking forward to putting stuff in the bag, which I'll end up taking off and throwing out."
3,Not one of the strudy one,It is kind of small. Even a 3 year girl can hardly put both her feet on the skate at the same time. And it is made of light iron pipes. Would not buy it again.
1,Disappointed,"We bought this for our 4-year old and are very disappointed. The scooter is inordinately annoying to put together and poorly designed. The ride is not smooth because the shape and material of the wheels make it stick in our regular asphalt driveway, it is impossible to get up any sort of speed on it, and it is not stable, always tilting to the right or left in the front part. It's been left outside in the weather over the last few months, and the Dora design on the main part has completely faded."
1,Reasoning,It is too repititious and not believable at all. I regret purchasing it. I do not recommend it to anyone.
5,very well written,This book was very well written and had scripture in it to back it up. Alot of things I needed to know and found out in this book.
4,Review of Book,The authors do an excellent job of presenting effective methods of argument. It gives both sides (LDS and not) for the interpretation of certain passages with scholarly (LDS and not) commentary. It then points to biblical passages and mormon writings and statements to show why some interpretations are incorrect and others are correct by using scripture to interpret scripture. I highly recommend it.
2,Same old same old,"I have two things to say about this book.First, it is, like just about all material now published by evangelicals on Mormonism, about as useful as a hearing aid at a pantomime show. It doesn't keep up with the latest arguments in Mormon apologetics from FARMS and the like. As a Christian, and as an apologist, I am ashamed that we are not doing better. I only award two stars because I think this book is the best of the crop that does exist.That said, I have a reply for the reader who charged Rhodes and Bodine with plagiarizing Marvin Cowan. That's a charge picked up uncritically from FARMS literature. I got in touch with Cowan and he indicated that he gave Bodine permission to use his material. So the big mistake is not plagiarism, but failing to avoid the appearance of it by not pointing to Cowan as a source.If you want better responses to Mormonism, tune in to my material at the Tekton Apologetics Ministries page."
1,This book helped me become a Mormon!!!,"I was really skeptical about the Mormons when I first picked up this book. I thought that all of the questions I had in my heart would be answered if I read this book. It seemed really interesting to me at first, but after awhile I got really sick and tired of the authors ""attitude"". He would tell what the Mormons beleived in, and then take a crack at them. I now know that a man's knowledge is very minute compared to Gods. So I would like to thank the author for helping me see the truth. The truth is not in his book, but another, another Testement of Jesus Christ."
1,MISLEADING...,"I purchased this book as an Christmas gift for my dad (a Mormon) thinking that this book was going to be geared towards Mormons and spirtually uplifting. He was deaply hurt and offended from the content of this book. The book ridiculed his faith as a Mormon and that was not my intent. The search featured recommended this book, I am very disappointed and humilated. I will be returning both titles..."
1,"This book Sucked, but made good for burning.",I received this book as a gift and couldn't make it past a few pages because there were no pictures!!! How in the hell am i suppose to find interest in a book if it has no pictures in it?!?! Long story short i was really cold the other night so I used this book to start a fire to heat up my room and it worked like a charm.
1,Cult?,"The author keeps referring to the LDS church as a cult. By definition a cult is: A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader.In Christ's day many would have considered his movement (Christianity) a cult by definition and now it's the largest religious form of worship in the world. So let Mormons do their thing. There's upwards of 12,000,000 of them now so I guess they're not a cult anymore."
1,Recycling,"Portions of this book were lifted essentially word for word from an earlier book by Marvin Cowan, without credit or acknowledgement. In school, that would bring a failing grade for the assignment. Whatever the merits or demerits of Rhodes and Bodine's case, in my opinion, potential buyers should think twice before they support such behavior with their money."
4,Like this product,"I like this product. It is easy to use, for a person just learning fingerspelling."
5,One Of A Kind,"I own many blues CD's and almost the entire Johnny Winter catalog and I must say that this is a standout CD. On track after track Johnny shows us why he is considered one of the greatest blues guitarists/singers of all time. If you only buy one Johnny Winter CD for your collection, this would be the one. A constant source of enjoyment."
1,Unsatisfied,Order shipped even though it was cancelled. No response to e-mails and long wait for credit. Do not do business with these people!
1,AN INSULT TO JOHNNY WINTER'S TALENT !,"This has got to be the worst album Johnny Winter ever released ! After 3 succesfull albums at Alligator, Johnny signed for MCA Records, who released this album on their Voyager-label. As soon as this album came out, he left MCA and joined Virgin/Pointblank instead. I, for one, am not surprised ! He probably turns in his grave anytime someone plays this CD ! What you get here is a ""commercial"" form of blues-rock, which is really below par all the way ! It's like someone told Johnny not to play too loud, otherwise he might wake the neighbours ! Did they give him Prozac before recording this album, or what ? Third-rate guitar-playing from a man who could usually set the house on fire with his guitar, absolutely trivial lyrics, ... Oh, my goodness, I just can't believe how much of a disappointment this album is ! Go to his Alligator or Pointblank Cd's, even to his albums for Columbia, but forget you ever heard about this lousy CD !"
3,The music that goes nowhere...,"All the traks I've had the opportunity to listen from this album don't get anywhere. They seem to want to blend Sanskrit and Bengali prayers with more contemporary influences and instruments, but fall short... If you really want to enjoy attempts to do something similar, listen to the works of Dead Can Dance and Lorenna McKennit."
1,Rasa-Union-,Typical New Age at it's worst.Their first CD-Devotion- is outstanding.The quality of the recording is poor as well.They are just trying to make money and abandoned making music.Very sad.
4,"Great CD, but not worth 5 stars","This performance of Bach's Cello Suites on Viola is respectable. However, I don't feel that the performer really takes us far enough in terms of expression. These pieces are often performed in a dry manner and no one could accuse Ms. Mcarty of that. However, there is so much musical possibility here that I have yet to hear exploited to any great degree.It is certainly an enjoyable recording but all these five star ratings are a bit much. That being said, it may just be a matter personal preference. This is a good CD for viola students who want to hear nearly flawless technical performance."
5,A true essential,"This recording is an essential for every Bach lover's collection. This is a phenomenal performance that only gets better the more you listen to it. Also, as a violist myself, I notice that as I study each suite, I gain even more respect for the depth and perception which Ms. McCarty displays in her playing. Each suite has a delightful and distinct character of its own. This is a grerat recording of the suites, whether on cello or viola."
3,Eh - It was alright,"Honestly, I thought the album was well done. As a violist, I was glad to see a solo viola performer taking on the challenge of interpreting Bach's viola suites, but really, this CD has nothing on Yo Yo Ma's version on cello. McCarthy just can't match Ma's interpretive abilities; and honestly, I've heard better viola recordings as well, though I can't remember who off of the top of my head. Still, it's a decent recording, with very nice acoustics."
2,"full featured, bad battery","Brother bought this as a gift. It's lacking basic function/design but it has a ton of features to try and make up for its shortcomings.Pros: 20aH battery (replaceable), stable design, 2 covered AC plugs, 1 car plug/port, big fuseCons:1. bad battery (wont hold charge for more than a few days)2. the jumper cables are stored separate from the unit3. can't view battery charge level while unit is charging4. the hose for the air compressor is too short and awkward to store.5. The air compressor is really weak/low end.6. the covers for the AC plug and radio don't sit properly, needs modding.7. Cheap foam grips on handle. Better idea to leave it as hard plastic.features: radio/clock/alarm, 2 standard AC outlets, 1 car/DC port, fused, easily accessed battery compartment, multi-function emergency light, small items storage compartment (needle, tire valve caps, etc)"
1,Battery Lasted 2 months,"This ""Powerpack"" lasted 2 months before it stopped charging. Don't buy it for a power source and there's less expensive air compressors!"
4,Xantrex Power pack,Not sure this unit is still available. Radio is very cheap. Vol knob no longer works on radio. Everything else works as advertized. Useful item. Has plenty of power
4,Still working after 4 years,"I see all the bad reviews and had to say, that I have had mine for a LONG time and have had NO problems with it! Not all items are perfect, jumper cables may be a little short, but you would be buying a PORTABLE unit, right? If they wanted longer cords, buy the regular jumper cables. I use it in the rv, suv, and sedan...love it!!"
5,Gilad's Abs Workout,"This dvd really work out your abs, tightens, flattens. Best ad dvd i have purchased."
2,gilad usually does better,"I didn`t like this one because of two reasons1. He is counting here really strange, i honestly didn`t like that ""2-count"" type of workout, fisrt he made you do the move on 2-count, then the same move at regular 1-count, this was a bit confusing for me.2.The overall workout is waaay too easy. For those, who doing 45/45 split routine - this one is going to be a breeze.I like Gilad generally, think he is awesome, but this particular workout is not for me. May be for the first time-super-beginners who like to do easy moves slowly, on 2 counts"
5,Gilad's workout really works,"My wife used to workout with Gilad on TV until the local stations stopped airing him so when we found them on Amazon my wife had to have them and she loves the DVD. Most of it she saw on TV but there are some new things she has been able to use, and she was growing tired of doing Taebo all the time so it something nice to alternate with."
3,okay,"This video is okay. I don't really feel that I get a great workout afterwards. The last segment is hard at the end, but that's about it."
1,Waste of Money,"Gilad's abs workout is the worst abs workout i have ever seen. He mechanically instructs you, constantly barking orders to his complex, but ill-conceived exercises. Compared to eight minute abs, this dvd is very complicated, and it takes forever-- all the while you're lying there, trying to figure out exactly what you're supposed to be doing, wondering how this could possibly be a workout, and being distracted by ladies in bikini's.Not only do i NOT RECOMMEND this dvd, but i strongly recommend you save your money, in spite of all of the good reviews. The video and audio quality is just as dated as the actual exercises. And when you can get an abs exercise that only takes 8 minutes, it makes absolutely no sense to buy this dvd, which basically consist of a buff guy barking non-sensical orders at you, with babes in the background, for 30 minutes. Super annoying."
5,Don't be fooled,Don't be fooled by the dated production on this long running title. The methods and the presentation work!!!!!!! It will tighten those abs and make you beg for mercy if you do it properly.
5,Wonderful,"Gilard is the best fitness instructor for me. His progam is amazing. Everybody can find something for yourself. There are three levels for beginners, intermediates and advanced. It is not easy but after weeks you find your ABS flat, shape and you will be full of energy. I have only hope that another his dvd we can find on amazon.I recommend this dvd for everybody who want to have flat ABS."
3,Gilad's Abs is a good workout but...,It's a little too short a program. Every exercise is a good one but I find I need to add reps to almost every section. Definitely not to the vertical leg lifts though. Good beginners program.
5,Super Awesome Plush!,"This is a super good plush! very good.I sleep with it almost every night. I play with them with my little brother every day. I also have Mario,Luigi,blue Yoshi,Koopa Troopa,Toad, and this Princess Peach.The only reason it's 4 star durability is because I never really noticed but in the very back at the top of her there is a very tiny hole. It can't be fixed.No stuffing came out though.I totally recommend this toy to collect,play, or both.Definitely for Princess Peach fans or a Mario colletion."
3,Ehhhh,I was so exited to get this plush then it looka nothing like the picture but i still liked it ehh not as i expected.:(
3,I would not waste my $ if I were you!,"Once peach came in the mail it looked good, in first 2 hours the crown came off, I took a hot glue gun then two hours later it came off again the next day it started ripping I don't care for it that much. (my 10 yr old gave info to review it)"
2,Princess Peach,"This product is not very durable for a young girl to play with on a constant basis. Also, price is a little high for a small stuffed toy."
1,Far too fragile (even for a princess...),"We had the toy for two days when the seam between the hand and the glove split! I know I wasn't expecting my kids to deliver this toy down to the next generation for their kids to play with, but seriously, TWO DAYS?! All my children did was run around the house holding the toy by the hand. I am deeply disappointed by the quality."
3,Doll for my daughter,"I wanted to get a princess toy for my daughter and being married to a serious gamer I automatically thought of princess peach but the quality isn't super great but isn't really bad either. There is a string and suction cup thing on her head so she is more for s window, I cut that off and she is a cute doll and my daughter likes her I just wish the quality was better."
1,Bad unit,The unit was used and not working. I feel that they knew this and sold it anyway.I'll be sure to confirm that all product we purchase is new.
3,Mildly interesting,"The author of this book was a nephew of Winston Churchill. He was captured by the Germans and held as a hostage in Colditz, their maximum-security prison camp. Lots of daring escapes took place from Colditz, but Romilly, being valuable to the Germans, was heavily guarded and couldn't participate much. His story is interesting if you enjoy prisoner-of-war narratives or WWII history, but it's not the most exciting book I've read along those lines. I'd recommend ""The Colditz Story"" by P.R. Reid or ""The Great Escape"" by Paul Brickhill."
4,Imagine,"Imagine Blake from Jets To Brazil frontingTexas is the Reason with an Austrailian accent.That's what Blueline Medic sounds like initially.Then the quality of the songs hits you.Very, very good stuff, especially ""Making the NouveauRich"" and ""Not Interested"".Power-Pop/Punk at it's best."
1,"Close but not quite ""there""","The author of this book had a very interresting idea, which triggered me to read the book. Though most everything she states is a ""true"" observation, I find her explainations to be highly vivid and uneducated in the field of conciousness. There are psychological terms and explainations on human behavior that she referrs to as a ""waking dream""; and she doesn't go into great depth on it because she clearly is uninformed. I would recommend sticking to more psychological information from medically certified authors. This is where you'll truly get a chance to understand the unconcious self."
1,Broken,"Did not last a year. I use it about once or twice a month. To be fair it did not fall apart but the paint chipped off. that was disgusting thinking that might have gotten in my food the last time I used it. The grip is also sort of painful when using, maybe that just me."
4,It'll get you movin,"This CD is the best cruising beat! It's great! If you are cleaning the house or just out running arins, it s the best for getting you up and moving! I insist on buying this!"
4,"If you're looking for a song used in the movie ""Nosferatu""","If you are looking for the song called various way such as: ""Zinskaro"", ""Tsintsharo"", ""Tshintsharo"", ""Zinzkaro"" had used in the movie ""Nosferatu"" and Kate Bush's song ""Hello Earth"" in Hounds of Love, your search is finally over! The song No.3, ""Cin ckaro"" is what you want. However, now I found out that both ""Nosferatu"" and ""Hello Earth"" used only some part of the song, and atmosphere is a little bit different. But it's worth to have if you still want to hear the famous part."
4,Good read,"Though I've only read a few of this authors books, I did enjoy this particular one thoroughly. Yes, it was a lot of information to take in, but I felt that the characters were well rounded and the storyline was solid. If you're interested in fast paced reading, action, suspense and a little romance on the side, this is the book for you."
2,The formula is getting old.,"Jack Du Brul is a good writer, he actually is a very good writer; but he also is a Clive Cussler clone. And that may not necessarily be a good thing. His hero Philip Mercer is a carbon copy of Dirk Pitt. As a matter of fact Du Brul is acting as ghost writer for Cussler latest installment of his Oregon Files series.His books are good entertainment, this one is a little exhausting, by the end of the book Mercer has gone around the world at least three times, unfortunately you are so tired you don't even care of the outcome anymore. The plots are also kind of dislodged, there is a plot line that starts in Area 51 that never gets resolved...Anyway, if you like the Cussler stile Du Brul fits the bill, but I would try some of his other offerings like ""The Medusa Stone"" or ""Pandora's Curse"" instead of This one."
3,Decent Mercer outing,"Decent action thriller by Cussler's heir, Jack DuBrul. My only complaint is that Mercer's girl du jour, Tisa Nguyen, shows up in the book as merely a sex object for him as well as for her brother (in an icky incest subplot). Her ghost haunts him through another book, and I guess the sex was pretty good, because it's not like he took the time to really get to know her well."
3,"still a page-turner, but need some new action from mercer","adventure is what makes you turn the pages in this type of series, and jack does spend a little too much time on mercer's love interest in this edition. kind of the 007/on her majesty's secret servie ploy where the movie was more about his relationship than the action. however, jack does his homework on the technical stuff and incorporates it extremely well as he always does without being pompous. i also like the way he's toned down the language a bit in recent books.if you're new to the mercer series you might begin with his previous effort river of ruin. it's a great story and helps you get best acquainted with mercer.jack is beyond a promising author, and i'll pick the next mercer edition up the week it comes out. i'm just ready for 2 things - a) some new characters - who can't love harry, but the booz and smokes at tiny's is starting to get a little old; b) some more original plots that don't wax of cussler, reilly, or preston/child."
4,Suspense Thriller,"I enjoyed the plot from this author. A bit of science fiction, action on 2 to 3 fronts but came together in the end"
2,i did not read,"Good gloves for light gardening, but i thought these were white mules. Had i known these were light weight i would not had a problem.. i should had read further."
1,A waste of money,"The instructions are complicated, the playset launches poker chip-sized projectiles at the child's face when the wrong hand movements are made, and the set is made of cheap plastic parts that don't stay together. I'd return it if I could find all the parts. A terrible toy."
4,Pretty good,"I really love this toy. It's fun to practice your jutsus in it without looking stupid, and I like to dodge the discs when they come at me too. The only thing I don't like about it is that the sound effects aren't exactly welcome, but other than that, it's a great toy. I reccomend it. =)-Meg <3"
3,Eh...,"I my son seemed to enjoy the product for a couple days (the length of his attention span). However, the toy is difficult to understand. It is hard to figure out how to work the thing. I mean, it could just be me that I am not good with electronical games, but we both tried to figure out how to work it. Also, the sides fall off very easily and the discs get stuck between the sides. Other than that, my son had a good time playing. But he did lose interest quickly because it is hard to figure out how to play the actualy game and use the gloves."
4,Naruto Ninja Challenge Playset with Interactie Gloves,"My son really likes this toy, but, you have to have a lot of room so that you can be able to really appreciate the movement of the flying disks, and for easy disk retrival."
2,a waste of money,"I got this for my 4 and 8 year old grandkids for christmas when they ask for it after seening it on tv. we were all very disappointed when it was unwraped. It was hard to understand and get to work and after we did, it was nothing like they thought it would be. now it just set in the closet."
3,"Great Series, Weaker Link","I love the Eve Diamond series and would recommend it, as well as her other 'stand alone' novels, to any reader of mysteries and LA noir fans. That said, this was my least favorite of the series. The timing just seemed off, the characters were rote in their behaviour. If you read the series, many loose ends are tied up in this book but that somehow took away from the plot and case she was working on. I'm a big fan of the series, and suggest reading them in order (Jasmine, Sugar Skull, this one, Savage Garden). However, this one leaves a little bit of an aftertaste."
4,Passion and mystery!,"Hamilton's hero, Eve Diamond, continues her adventures, both journalistic and romantic in this latest installment in the series. Eve, the daughter of a Russian √©migr√©, lives in an artsy multi-cultural community near Downtown Los Angeles, Los Feliz, and pursues her journalistic trade throughout the city. Her specialty seems to be stories involving adolescents but she follows other leads as well. In this book she is following a story involving the adoption of children from Asia.In an interesting parallel she also discovers she is pregnant by Silvio, her latest amour. She has not seen him much due a court case and so she is feeling lonely and emotionally vulnerable when an old love shows up.Eve is a complex and interesting character. This latest installment brings more passion and personality into the Eve Diamond series."
1,too slow by far,this novel is one of the few books that I failed to finish. I struggled through to page 156 and felt that the plot still had not developed. Decided that it was time to give it away as I felt that it was never going to get better.
4,Good,"The minority book that i receive came right on time. I love the book, a couple of highlights, but it help me. I'm glad that i bought this book from this website. I will do more often. Thank you"
2,Full of Charts,"As a textbook, it is difficult to address the fast paced world of health care and health care disparities. The situation and statistics change too quickly. In the case of this book, the authors attempt to cast a wide net and report as many statistics as possible related to the subject matter. There is little else in the way of substance in this book. Unfortunately, that means that the book is out-of-date and of little use by the time it makes it to the bookstore/library shelves."
1,Too many markings and Highlighter,"I am a F/24 year old graduate school student. According to my items description there was supposed to only be minimal notes and highliter in my book. However, there are so many markings it's hard for me to concentrate on what I'm reading. I would just appreciate a more accurate description of the books condition in the future."
1,Didn't like it,The whole movie felt cold and grossed me out too much. I thought it was too boring and not enough scares for a horror film.
4,overall good phones,"I haven't heard other in-ear phones that fall into the same class as these, such as Shure E4C or Westone UM2, but overall they seem to be a good bang for a buck. I previously owned Etymotic ER6i and I only after buying these phones discovered that they are also made by Etymotic Labs. Fortunately sound is nothing like Etys, it has much more bass but still has that good treble of Etys. It only had triflanges and foam tips included, but fortunately foam tips are just for my ears. Also, I'm thinking of removing the pod, that should considerably improve the sound, here's link to tutorial[..........]"
4,"Great sound, great comfort, great isolation","I use the ER-4P. For the stuff that the ER-4P is bad for (dance trax, rock, and casual listening stuff), the iM716 really does well. It is a bit muddy and not accurate at the top end, but overall is very balanced. Unlike the Er-4P, the iM716 does not have a significant mid frequency hump. the ER-4P beats the iM716 with classical music, jazz and some acoustic materials. The iM716 is more for the modern music with electronic sounds, etc. Enough ranting. I recommend it."
1,These earphones are awful.,"Do not buy these earphones for an iPod.1. Way, way over-priced.2. Sound is very tinny. Bass is nonexistent.3. Clog up with ear wax and you have to buy another pair (see #1).I have a pair of free earphones from Jet Blue that sound better, honestly. Those free ear phones had better bass and I didn't have to turn my volume up to MAX to hear the song. I am going to return these for a refund. They are an awful waste of money.I think the people who wrote positive reviews for these earphones either used them for something other than a mobile electronic device, they work for Altec or they are very, very high."
1,dont waste your money,Grossly over-priced and useless - Sony's $10 headphones sounded just as good. The headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best.
1,TERRIBLE!! AN ABSOLUTE JOKE!!!!!,Whoever wrote a good review about these headphones works for Altec Lansing and is trying to rip you off!!!I am blown away by how bad these are. It is laughable - They are going straight in the trash. The free headphones you get with an i-pod etc are WAY better!! Trust me!My poor wife thought she was getting me a nice christmas present and all she got was junk. Thanks a bunch Altec & Amazon!
2,Another lackluster entry to a once gripping series.,"Another lackluster entry to a once gripping series - that pretty much says it all. This book and the last book I read in this series has pretty much ruined the series for me. Foster used to be one of my must read authors - meaning, if I saw a book by him I bought it no questions asked. I hate it when a good author goes bad."
3,Off track for the series,"Pip and Flinx books by Alan Dean Foster are always entertaining. This book follows a couple of others from the series where the main story is really just a ""stopover on another world"" with a little of the series continuation tacked onto the end. The story is entertaining but does not have really anything to do with the commonwealth. It is a ""well meaning man from an advanced civilization lands on a primative world and how he affects the aliens"" story. Flinx brings off of the world nothing to help with the galactic threat or answers to his search. Mr Foster may want to concentrate on the series and skip the errant layovers. Good only."
2,Failed to advance the story,"I reviewed this when it first came out and it looks like my review and some others I recall were ""lost"". This story stunk. I love this series but the last several installments were very lame. Save your money until he gets back to telling the story we all fell in love with. Tell me about the galactic threat, his growing abilities, his sometime girlfriend...come on man."
2,Barely worth reading...,"This book and the one that preceeded it 'Sliding Scales' appear to be nothing but filler in the Pip & Flinx story arc. They add next to nothing to the story we've been reading for a couple decades now. When I saw them sitting next to each other on the library shelf I was beside myself with glee, new Flinx! Sad to say I was sorely disapponted by what I got. Mr. Foster's writing style has changed in just the last couple years, the humor, the characters to care about, the continuing story line that started in Tar-Ayim all seem to have been lost. I read the book, I didn't really enjoy it. On with the story, Mr. Foster! Enough filler and books that go nowhere!"
4,"Good interlude, but get back to the main plot!","Love the Pip & Flinx stories. This one was very well written, but it did not advance the main storyline of the series at all. It did present some new information about Flinx's gift (and his curse), but I was hoping for more about the quest he SHOULD have been on...On the other hand, when I like a series this much, I don't really want it to end. I guess if the author is going to procrastinate a bit, and make some more money off the series, I can enjoy the ride!"
4,A diversion but a good read,"While RUNNING FROM THE DEITY may diverge from the central story line of the series, it does add more depth to the universe of Flinx. As in BLOODHYPE, which I came to enjoy due to the way Flinx is introduced and has somewhat limited ""screen time"", RFTD is another view into Flinx's life away from trying to save us all. Remember: These are the ""adventures"" of Flinx and Pip and as the adventure continues so does Flinx's maturation."
4,Great Dip in book,"I homeschool two kids aged 8 and 10.I love Eye Witness books mainly because the kids enjoy picking them up and dipping into them. This book is just right for that.I would not recommend it for anyone wanting in depth information about Ancient China, but it is great for sparking the imagination and giving an overall picture."
5,ANCIENT CHINA 1620 B.C.-1912 A.D.,"this an interesting book i read DK books are the best non-fiction books.the book talked about all the emperors,firstemperor of china,great wall,the food,and the silk road.Youshould buy this book it's really a good DK book.the price isjust 19.95 OR 15.95"
3,Nice,"As a complement, or if you enjoy chinese's aesthetics, I would recomend to buy this book. You'll have little info about China, but you will like this book anyway, besides it is very cheap. I liked it"
1,What the !?!?,"this dystopian look at the future post nuclear fallout is both funny and romantic.""The girl in the...um..ah..lead is very cute. Ah, I just wanted (scratching my head) I just wanted to know if she'd like to go out to eat a cup of coffee, um, maybe, but probably not. Sorry."""
3,"Annoying dialogue, no plot","The 20 somethings here all speak in annoying stop/start semi-phrases, full of 'likes' and 'I means.' Was there actually a script, or did they improvise a lot of this drivel? The 24-year-old star wanders through her college town life, in meaningless jobs, in pursuit of a boyfriend she can't have, while a nerd (the director/writer) pursues her but keeps sabotaging himself. In fairness, I was able to watch this to completion, which is rare for me. The cover contains some rave reviews, so someone liked it. I did notice the use of a pay phone here while some characters appear to have late 90s cellphones. Was the pay phone a deliberate anachronism? No laughs here, no sex and no tears either. Just a slice of contrived life."
1,This Is Bad....,"The only thing worse than some self-conscious dorks are self-conscious dorks on film.... Genuine 100% engineered coolness. Groovy....</waned chuckle> I'll quote my good friend Alejandro, ""AWKWARD~!""The DVD won't have sound if your DVD player cannot decode MPG sound.... Funny (silent Ha Ha) encoding choice...."
2,Um...,"If life was actually that stale and a discourse between college graduates were that vapid...WOWFour years of college should have taught one to speak in complete sentences and verbally express one's thoughts clearly. No wonder she can't keep a job.Dialogue used multitudinous ""I don't know, like, you know..."" NO I DON'T KNOW!!!"
4,cool toy,Cool toy for those kids who want to take a close look and have a light with it too. My kids love it. Very durable.
5,footnotes . . .,"Apart from ""reveal codes"", without which I feel lost, one of the things I like best about WordPerfect is that it manages to get 98% of footnotes on the right page - as against Word which is always putting footnotes on the next page, or spilling them on to two - and on occasions three - pages. If you prepare camera-ready copy, or if you are writing a thesis and don't want to annoy the examiner unnecessarily, this is a big plus."
4,Wordperfect beats Word Hands Down,"This review is strictly on the WordProcessor. I've yet to encounter anything good that Word does near as well as Wordperfect. Tables, formating, merges etc.If you want to promote capal tunnel syndrome with obsessive mouse use, WORD has a substantial advantage. Its fun to watch the WORD 'experts'. With an absolute minimum use of quickkeys, the WORD Expert is constantly putting their offhand on the hip, leaning back and fooling with the mouse- a true model of efficency {NOT!}. Mircosoft assumes the user is too dumb to learn quick-keys and insteads touts ""Ease-of-Use"" mouse work.WORD is like AOL, everywhere and charging prices based on the label rather than the quality."
5,Welcome to MJ Holmes,"I started reading Mary J. Holmes books because she was one of my grandmother's favorite writers. An extremely prolific and popular romance novelist from the mid- to late- eighteen hundreds, her books are warm melodramatic love stories full of charming period details. Although never classed as literature, as such, I find her writing consistently compelling and readable. To curl up under a warm quilt with one of her books remains one of my key anti-depressants.The Abandoned Farm tells the story of a mistaken inheritance, and an old wrong. A spirited young lady goes undercover as a serving girl in what properly should be her family home. She finds more than she expects in the young master of the house.Connie's Mistake is the stronger story, and details the dark secret that keeps Connie from being able to marry her childhood sweetheart Kenneth. Some of Holmes' favorite themes-- indulgence in alcohol leading to dissipation and death, pure love, and mistaken identities."
2,doesn't work most of the time,"Very disappointed, the heart rate monitor almost never works especially when I am working out. Not worth the money. If you buy it from Amazon good luck trying to return it! Customer service barely spook english and didn't understand my basic questions. I am sending it back but don't know if I will get my money back. They said maybe 80% and the watch doesn't even work!"
1,Poor,"I have use a heart monitoring watch for a year and wanted to get a better one. So I bought this one and ended up sending it back. It worked for about one week. I could not get a heart rate while working out, that is the main reason why I bought the watch."
4,Great No Hassle HRM with extras,"Got this because chest straps are irritating, and this is a much more convienent substitute. Only complaint is that it can take a few seconds to grab your HR - but well worth it for the convienence. Plus the other features (calorie measure etc.) are a nice bonus."
2,Save your money,"This watch ran out of batteries within 4 months! It also isn't accurate, takes a really long time to register the heart rate. By the time it gives you a pulse, your heart rate is elevated due to stress.It's now in my closet collecting dust.I have the Nike heart rate monitor and that works much better."
1,Misrepresentation,"This was a very disapponting purchase.The watch is not a replacement,by any means, to the strap continuous heart rate monitoring technology, such as the one used by Polar. You don't wear a strap, but you get a reading only when you press your fingers on the watch top plate. You can't run or bike for two long when your hands are in that heart rate sensing position - one over the other...I wish a simple explanation like that would have been given as part of the technical explanation.Anyhow, we have used the watch only once or twice and reverted back to the strap sensor/watch."
2,Brewery Planning,"This book lacked specific details on opening a small brewery. Now that I rexamine the title it states it is only a guide, and I found it to be a cursory overview at best. I wanted a book with start-up costs, equipiment costs and the like. Also costs for bulk malt and yeasts would be helful. I wanted to get a feel for costs I was not thinking about. Better coverage of state specific wholeseller/retail laws would be important. Coverage of state alcohol laws and the process of obtaining permits would be benificial. ..."
2,Save Your Money,"Vague, vague and vague. Did I mention there's few specifics in this book? Certainly not worth $80."
5,Much improved design,"Hello,I was worried reading the earier review. This fits perfectly in my bar blender. This has a much inmproved design. The old design caught food or ice below the blades and either would not blend or would bind the machine. I think this happened right before I needed to get the part. Ice formed below and stuck the blades even though the machine kept workindg. I found a nut and a washer and metal grindings in the drink. The blades were not attached anymore. This new design is tapered below and the blades sit higher up to ease food/ice mixing. Thanks Hamilton beach."
2,item delivered is not the item pictured,"I ordered this item sold by Goodman's labelled ""Hamilton Beach 911993900 commercial blender cutter blade""which is pictured to be identical to the original Hamilton Beach commercial blender cutter blade I had, namely with thin, sharp, sharp-tipped blades mounted on a narrow pylon-type structure. What I got was something with thicker, stubbier, not-sharp, rounded-tip blades mounted on a broad conical structure. It's pretty much the same size, it fits, and it works, but it noticeably does not blenderize as finely as the actual original (the one that was pictured).This is false advertising."
5,Peach and Blue Review,"Peach and Blue is a book that tells about how a peach and a toad lives. Peach is dynamic because it notices everyhting wherever she goes and it notices the beauty of life. Blue is static until he meets Peach. Peach teaches him about all the colors in life that Blue never noticed. I am a lot like Blue. I don't notice everything unless I really pay attention. When I was at McKeever at ""magic spots"" everyone looked at nature. It was like how peach lives, always learning about nature. I think that this book is a good one. It teaches people how to open their eyes, look around them, and respect nature. It also teaches people to find what is around them."
5,Everyone should know this book!,"The illustrations are stunning. This book teaches about friendship in an amazing way. Blue does things for Peach that she can't do herself, and Peach helps Blue ""see"" how lovely the world is that he takes for granted every day."
5,"Peach(y)...and, blue.","such magical splendor. beautifully illustrated. i defy anyone to read this and not get a lump in their throat. it'll remain a fav o'mine. (to the publisher-- i ain't real keen on ""ads"" right next to the text on the inside of the fr. & back covers-- it detracts from the charm)."
5,A Book For All Ages No Matter How Old!,"This is a book about the endearing qualities of true friendship. I was touched when I read this book. Sometimes we forget that in our busy schedules, people are the most important things in our lives. Remind the people that are dear to your heart that they are loved!"
5,Peach and Blue by Sarah S. Kilborne,"Peach and Blue is a wonderful story, that I would recommend to everyone. It is also a learning tool about friendship, caring, and appreciating the beauty of nature. This is a story everyone can relate to. The illustrations are as detailed and colorful as Peach's view of the world. Everyone should at one time read Peach and Blue. I guarantee it will change your view of the world. After you read Peach and Blue, you will never look at a rainbow of a sunset the same again."
4,Peach and Blue,"This is a beautiful story about friendship, although it may be more appropriate for older children and adults. Children may not understand it's true meaning. For an adult or young adult who has to face the upcoming death of a friend or family member it is very meaningful. I cry every time I read it, but I love the story."
1,Sentimental Slop,"A frog and peach fall in love before the peach finally rots. Preachy, treacly, syrupy, sentimental slop."
1,Excellent book badly scanned,"To be sure, this is one of Wodehouse's best, one that can't be beat on CD. But the Kindle version has apparently been optically scanned and posted uncorrected, so sometimes ""don't"" appears as ""dont"", ""fiver"" as ""liver"", and ""for me"" as ""forme"".It's tolerable, but Kindle reading should be unfettered joy, not joy with hiccups. Me? I'm looking for another version of this joyful read."
3,Overpriced!,"Five stars for the quick corrector, but this vendor has jacked up the price. This same product is only $14.50 FULL PRICE at clinique.com."
4,Consistently enjoyable album,"While not as impressively thematic as Waxman's best efforts, this score is still a remarkably consistent listening experience, the orchestra alternating between playful and dour with ease. The optimistic Finale is a definite highlight."
5,Striking anatomy of Africa today,"Thought provoking, intelligent, studiously researched - yet utterly non-judgemental and humane. The Shackled Continent is a must read for anyone who is interested in all things Africa, shame not enough African leaders and politicians alike get their hands on it."
5,Great!!!,I just watched it twice. The animation is very well done. This is the most beautiful Wonder Woman or any of the DC women have ever looked. The animation really followed closely to the artist's work in the book. I really enjoy these DC movies. I hope they continue to make them. I just wish they would have followed through with the 80's Teen Titans movie. Getting tired of seeing Superman and Batman. DC has so many great stories but they must feel they will sell more movies with them in them. Defiantly worth getting. I will be purchasing this one for sure!
2,Disappointed,"I won't say much, just this:1-The most stupid, irrelevant, dull and boring story/dialogue ever in a DCU animated.2-Never seen a DCU animated treat Batman so lame and low like this one.2 stars for Conroy/Daily original voice acts."
3,So-So,"I don't know, let's see, I'm a fan of JL unlimited but I haven't been too impressed with any of the movies. With this one I guess I would start by saying that the title is misleading, it's really a story about Supergirl not Superman or Batman. The animation is a little off too, not my favorite and the direction is just so-so. One big problem I have with these stories is the constant changing of power levels with the characters. In this it just seems like everyone has Superman level strength and I find that annoying. I also didn't really like the personality given to Supergirl here, she wasn't endearing at all but again, annoying. Some of the declarations in this don't sit well either like when Darkseid declares that Supergirl could have been the most powerful being in the Universe... um yeah, bad writing.I gave this 3 stars but to be honest I feel that once when you've seen this you'll probably never want to see it again. Once was enough for me anyway."
3,Interesting storyline but a very misleading title,"The story of this animated feature is decent. However, its title is very misleading. When I saw it, I was excited because I thought it was about Superman and Batman fighting off an invasion from Apocalyse. After I watched it, I was dismay by the fact that the center focus of the story was Supergirl.I do love fighting scene between Superman, Supergirl and Darkseid."
3,Supergirl/Superman,"I must say that while the story was fairly enjoyable, it was a bit misleading. Batman is largely unnecessary for the plot. He seems to be included only because the story began in Gotham. It focuses mostly on Supergirl and her arrival on Earth, and her eventual notice by Darkseid. I found it worthwhile and a good story if you like Kara and Superman in general, though it seems to me if it's called Superman/Batman, it should involve both characters about equally."
5,for the DC fan,"Perfect tie in for the rest of the series, voice acting as well as plot are second to none, the animation is tops notch!"
4,thrills but not cult,"Warner original animated movies are either good or great. Under the red hood or Public enemies are great pictures. This time, as an absolute Batman fan, I'm a bit disapointed. Sure the final fight is great but the Batman character is less inspirate this time. I'm not very sure about Darkseid's voice either, not quiet menacing enough. To conclude I'll say it's a good movie but more a Superman movie."
2,Great...till Kara and Darkseid start talking.,"There should have been more bat's and sup's as well as better animation is some areas. For instance when lila and kara are walking its just their picture being moved back and fourth with their lips being the only some what fluid movement and when superman and kara are flying at the end she makes a loop in the air and it was just bad, her movement was stiff and choppy as if it was rushed but I notice most of dc's animated projects cut corners whether it be some parts or the whole thing(JL season one). All in all Kara is annoying, Darkseid's voice threw me off, sup's and bat's use of the words ""a**"" and ""damn"" are not something kids should be hearing, title should have been superman/batman/supergirl go shopping, music score was too familiar with the orchestra going ""DA!! du du, du du DA! du du, much like the opening of batman begins. Batman was cool."
4,Stripper Supergirl vs transvestite Superman,"Overall movie was pretty good, they made it as a direct sequel to Public Enemies but the only connecting point is the giant kryptonite meteor.If you cannot tell from the cover of the DVD case Supergirl is introduced & kidnapped by Darkseid since he cannot get Superman to kneel to him. He does his brainwashing thing and sets a dark Supergirl (dressed like a stripper of course) against Superman knowing Superman will not fight his own cousin. Other stuff happens both before and after this event but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.Movie is pretty violent with lots of action, plenty of fights, an army of Doomsdays and a few surprise moments. Honestly the only thing I don't like about this movie is the design of Superman's face... he looks like the world's most Amazonian transexual. Something about the cheekbones and the fact he looks like he's wearing tons of eyeliner does not help."
3,I seen it,The movie is really mostly about supergirl and its not to much about batman at all wonder woman is in it and she had more action then the bat.but to make this short its an ok movie not the worst thats why i gave it a 3/5
2,"Rent, Don't buy. Actually, don't rent either","This story of Super Girl's arrival on earth and Darkseid's attempt to coopt her into his army is filled with cliches of teen angst and crappy dialog. Boring in its action sequences, corny when it tries to be funny, cheesy when it tries to be serious, and the plot never manages to provide a reason to care very much about the outcome: There is no great threat to the earth, only the life of whining Super Girl that is more annoying than endearing. The only redeeming quality it has is that it wasn't quite so bad to make me stop watching before the end.This may be a viable piece of entertainment for tween fans of the DC Universe, but anyone who appreciates some of the classics of the DC library such as Kingdom Come are likely to come away disappointed."
1,Defective disc,"Can't even give a review of this movie. Bought 2 copies of this disc and both were defective. After the previews, nothing happens, its freezes at the menu. Bought another copy from Best Buy, same problem. Yet WB says nothing about a recall of any kind."
1,drama,"I couldn't believe how much drama was in this movie it was like watching an episode of Jerry Springer between Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. That little brat supergirl was annoying."
3,Butch,"I really like DC Comics and so does my seven year old. There in lies the rub.It seems to me that DC has decided to go vulgar,sexist,and in my opinion shameless. This movie was dedicated to making sure the word BUTCH was heard loud and clear. I know you must be thinking butch,but think of a derogatory word for the human female. We own all the DC COMICS Blu-ray releases. Most of them have bad language or become slanted in some peculiar way to attempt to lower someones self esteem. Ex: The captured pilot in Wonder Woman. Remarks and attempting to get her drunk. I complain because my child loves the JLA and the actions,words or demeanor are just not acceptable. What is one to do? Hmmmmmmmmm NOT PURCHASE THIS STUFF ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!! As I was reviewing my review I realized i had rolled all the DC movies together. So I could stand corrected that this was the movie with Butch but it's in one of em."
3,Batman kinda sucks in this.,"First off the superman and batman public enimies was a much better movie. They did batman justice in that movie. Im a big batman fan so for me in this movie he was a let down. Batman is rarely done justice in a superman movie mostly because batman can't really handle the badguys that superman can. Batman is better in movies where the badguy is lex luthor like in public enimies or the joker. He's best when he uses stealth and his ninja like abilities. In this movie he does none of that. Not counting batman, this movie is worth watching if your in to the dc universe. Wonder woman is the truth. They need to give her her own movie. Her fight scenes are by far the best in the movie. Superman was good in this movie and the final fight scene with him is epic. I recommend this but beware that if your a batman fan like myself, you will be disappointed with this movie."
4,GREAT ACTION,"This movie NAILED IT! Yes the Doomsday scene was strange, knowing wht he can do but tht is just a small over site. OVER ALL it was great!"
3,"Okay, but not fantastic","The first Superman/Batman movie was great: funny, clever, and at times, mind-blowing. The second? Not so much. This film lacks some connection with its audience: I don't feel sorry for Supergirl's plights, nor do I really care about her as a character in this film. In the Justice League and affiliated TV series, her character was fleshed out and well-developed. Here, she just seems paper-thin, and the entire movie suffers because of it."
3,Ugh...,"Is it just me, or is Supergirl, boy, and man all kind of annoying? So, spoiler alert. Story in a nutshell...Supergirl crash lands into Gotham harbour, blows up a bunch of stuff for no apparent reason, annoys the hell out of Batman, goes shopping, gets sent to Wonder Woman to train,drowns in four inches of water...Kidnapped by Darkseid....blah blah blah...I thought this movie would never end. The only cool part was when Batman exploded Darkseid...but naturally, he comes back later because he's Darkseid. Anyway, I would not spend money on this movie. I recommend renting or Netflix before actually making the commitment to buy, since honestly, I think it could have been a lot better and a whole lot less annoying."
3,A Disappointed Fan,"I enjoyed the Batman/Superman series. I bought this film after enjoying Batman: Under the Red Hood. This film is, however, weak.The film has one main point: the introduction of Supergirl. It is an interesting premise. What if Superman wasn't the only survivor? What would happen if teenage survivor arrived on Earth instead of an infant? There is a lot of potential here, and almost all of it is thrown out. Supergirl can't speak English for about five minutes. Then she's just your average teenager rebelling against her authority figure. Their excuse for completely destroying any interest anyone could have in Supergirl's acclimation story is that Darkseid wants her for a minion. I like Darkseid as a villain. One of my favorite episodes in the Superman Animated Series involved Superman giving into his anger after Darkseid killed police officer. That one episode was a thousand times greater than this entire movie."
1,Superhero Catfight,PC Comics used Superman and Batman's name to sell this super lame piece of trash.
1,The Honest Review,"This movie was long and misleading, even the action was lameThe movie should have been called Super Girl: New HeroNot Superman / Batman ApocalypseArtwork 10Violence 5Script 5Voice Over 4Overall I give it a 4This movie is more for little girls ages 3 to 14It sucked"
5,a masterpiece....,"I have not seen the movie yet but, the coming attractions of this animation is breathtakenly beautiful! They really did a successful job on applying the transitional artwork style of Turner's over into animation. From what I've seen in the trailer, their staying close to the story line! Amazing!! I can't wait for this one to come out! Amazing story equals an amazing movie.One other great story that should become an animated movie is, ""Red Son""... anyone?"
5,Another great entry into the Direct to DVD line.,"I'm not going to give you my view, it can be summed up by reading the other reviewers and looking at the 5 stars I gave this movie. I recommend buying it with the extras."
5,"i own the comics, im happily surprised.","Michael Turner... R.I.P. before he went, he gave us superman/batman apocalypse. i find great pleasure in watching this movie, because his style is transferred into this flick, almost line for line. its amazing and awesome to watch this story unfold. it isnt the greatest story ever, but it was meant to re-introduce supergirl into dc canon. and it does that in a powerful way.the fights, and choreography are superior. if you have seen, or like, mikes art, you are in for a treat."
2,Lame....,"Im not going to take to terrible much time to write this review, the movie simply doesnt deserve it.Its more of a superman movie than anything, it shows a seminal story line for supergirl.So why 2 stars?First, since it had a PG-13 rating I was expecting some more action. Most of the movie is... pretty.... damn... slow... the only reason this movie attained such a rating is that it said the word b*tch one time. Also, Im not a big fan of how bright the animation is, I'd prefer something considerably darker. Also there was nothing special about the plot....All in all, I was lookin for something a bit more adult... but this movie fails in every way. Theres no reason this couldnt of been aired on television, nothing special aboutn the plot, action, or animation.....If you wanna see something truly worthy of a DVD release watch Batman: Under the Red Hood."
3,Superman/Batman Apocalyse Thought,"I received it within two days after testing out the special order links item. I thought the movie wasn't bad but I expected more conflict in the story. Plus there wasn't much of a fight on Earth with Darkseid unlike the TV version when he had control of the whole planet. Supergirl first showing up in Gotham in a ship didn't make sense to me and why would Batman and Krypto not trust her just because she's not used to her powers? Why was Krypto even in the story? I thought the plot was rushed and thrown together so the studio could get it out. Maybe when I watch it again I might like it more. Anyway, I gave it three stars for effort. For the price it wasn't bad."
2,A Disappointment For a Fan,"The good: I like the cast and the art is very well animated (though some of the designs are a little weak).The Bad: the characters play hot potato with the idiot ball the entire script, failing to work together like friends should (seriously, the Amazons and Wonder Woman kidnap Supergirl, and the damage Supergirl causes resisting is what they point to as a reason for taking her in; question, why didn't Wonder Woman just say, ""hey Clark, I have experience training women with super powers, let me teach her and have her stay on Paradise Island for a while"", in stead of the kidnapping). And when the characters act out of character, and the dialogue and story progression are so stilted and poorly done, it is hard to care about the action sequences.I love DC comics, and I love Timm's animation productions, and I don't think this measured up to the lofty work of the past, nor stood alone as a good picture on its own merits."
3,"Great Premise, to short....","This movie was much better than the Superman/Shazam film. The plot was very good, but once again DC did not make the movie long enough to warrant the price."
4,Almost exactly like the comic,the story is just like the original comic book form in all but 1 thing that i can think of and thats darkseid getting sucker punched by superman. the classic voice actors from the 90s cartoons come back. overall the story is good but not great just like the comic
5,A treat to the fans !!!,"- This is a more faithful adaption to the comic than Public Enemies (with the exception of the last battle with Darkside). This one scores more than the previous one for me (which i also liked). This way i can't wait to see Absolute Power or Finest Worlds get an animated movie treatment next year or so.- The characters' design follows Michael Turner's ones from the comic, but more tamed from some of the scenes in the comic (less sexy if you wish)- It was a treat to have Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman voiced by their original VAs, something that never happened before since Tim Daly was not in Justice League. Edward Asner's return as Granny was also nice.- Michael Ironside should have reprised his role as Darkside IMO.__________________"

4,jose ecuador,one month ago i bohgt this makita demolition hammer and sofar it is working very nice.it is not heavy but hits very hard I am happy with this makita.
4,"Good deal, fast shipping",I got a good deal on the print cartridge. Saved a lot off retail. Got the cartridge fast so I could get back to business.
4,Best tapes for Mini-DV camcorder Tape,"I invite everybody to use these tapes for their Mini-DV camcorders, excellent quality and best price."
4,Good cassettes,I have just used the first one. It is of good quality. pictures are crisp. My Sony camcoder is compatible with this. One issue is that it came in a pck of 3+3+3+1(I ordered ten). I was expecting it to come in one box. but otherwise no complain about the product. I have used it earlier as well and the video always turn out to be very good
4,Solid tool; good value,"My wife bought this saw for me as a Christmas gift to replace an ancient B&D; miter saw before starting some comprehensive home renovation projects. She based her choice on experience with other DeWalt that we own and we were not disappointed. I've used it to cut oak flooring and molding, treated deck lumber - even 4X4s, PVC, and various other wood materials. If I did it again however, I would go with the 12"" saw.What's good:Power - No jams or bindingAccuracy - Clean even cuts, accurate miter and bevel cutsPortability - The saw locks nicely and the two handles provide for easy manipulationDurability - After 5 years, the thing is as powerful and accurate as the day I bought it.Price - It's a good middle-of-the road price and a great valueWhat's not so good:Dust bag - Maybe it's just me, but the thing is a nuisance. It falls out a lot, clogs and has presented clearance problems in some locations."
5,"The best 10"" around","This Compound miter saw a great purchase. It was sharp, powerfull and easy to use. I used this saw to do trims and moldings around the house and it performed perfectly every time. (I did made some wrong angle cuts, but that was my fault). The power was great; as you drop the blade in to the wood there was no resistance. Every cut was clean and easy. The degrees and angle cuts were easy to adjust or dial to. My only regret was not buying the 12"" Saw. The 12"" would give me more room so I can cut 6"" base moldings if I decided to do 6"". A real solid piece of tool!"
5,Great Saw,"This saw is a wonderful asset to the weekend warrior. I have owned this saw for the last 6 months and it has performed tremendously. I had a small problem with the dust collection, and called Dewalt, they sent me a new one within five days. This saw is worth the money!"
4,Real pony,"Would you like to ride a pony? Then, this one is for you. Arbor run out is 0.004"" (good for pony!). Loud, but powerful and small. Now, where is my mustang Bosch 4410L?When somebody buys this saw, they should ask one question: ""Pony for $200, or mustang for $500?"""
5,What The Husband Wanted,"I purchased this item for my husband, for his Birthday, he had been telling me for a year or so that this is the Miter Saw he really would like to have. I kept looking at different places and finally decided onAmazon.com, because the price was within my budget. We are beginning to do some remodel work in our home and this will be utilized a lot. He is thrilled with his new ""toy"". Thank you Amazon.com."
5,Great miter saw,This miter saw is terrific! It's easy to set up and needs little or no adjustment right out of the box. I do a lot of precision miter work and found it much better than Craftsman and Ryobi models that I've previously owned.
5,Excellent saw,"I bought this saw approx. 5 years ago for doing all the trim in my house. It has also been used for many woodworking projects. No power tool has saved me more time than this one. It was off by a fraction of a degree out of the box. An easy adjustment. Since that simple adjustment was made 5 years ago, the saw has remained accurate. No further adjustments needed. The vertical clamp from the miter gauge for the DW746 with sliding table fits this saw. The dust collection bag is not worth much. I glued a 2 1/2"" to 1 1/4"" adapter into the dust port to use the saw with my shop vacuum. This sucks up most of the dust. The saw has done everything I asked of it. It is fairly compact and not too heavy - so it is easy to move around. I mounted my saw on a sheet of plywood with a 2 x 4 cleat under it, allowing it to be mounted on a WorkMate. and stored on a shelf when not in use. This has worked very well. Overall very satisfied. No complaints."
3,"""Dusty Flight, set 'em up hot!""","Vietnam was a war in which some of the world's best pilots and some of its most expensive planes were used to dive-bomb ... trucks. It's J. D. Wetterling's gift that he can make this stuff fascinating. The fighter pilot lingo and the symbiosis between man and plane are wonderfully done. (That a fighter squadron can go through a whole tour without ever meeting an enemy aircraft is just another indication of what a wacky war that was.) I'm sorry I can't say the same about the obligatory love affair with an army nurse that drives the plot. Generally I skipped the romance and hurried on to the next occasion when Dusty Flight ""set 'em up hot."" You won't find pilots more believable than these.-- Dan Ford"
1,Just too Much Religion to Bear,"Much of the action was OK and some of the back at base stuff was OK, but this got to the point of a Preacher's rant. I have nothing against religion I just do not want it rammed down my throat. The religious sub-text and it really became the main text, was just too much."
1,"A Little Too ""Godly""","Sorry but I had to end the read before the end. As a retired Air Force crew member during the Viet Nam era I was looking forward to some solid and factual flying missions and although the segments which contained that depiction of flying rang true it soon became tempered and then overwhelming religious. It seemed to go from a few pages of flying to several pages of religious passages and quotes from the Bible. It appeared to me that almost every action that was taken was guided by some ""higher authority"".If I wanted to bone-up on religion I would seek out those particular books but for the author to assume I want to read about his perception of religion I feel is inappropriate and, as a result I shall not seek nor shall I read another book by JD Wetterling. (sound familiar?)"
3,Pleasant surprise,"At first I was a little disappointed by these covers with rap overlays. Still not pleased with all of them. I had ordered this because it had my favorites and didn't require a $40 investment. But, when I listened to it, they seemed ruined by the rap. However, I was caught by surprise by ""Words We Cannot Say"". In fact, I'd like to share it with my friends. I think that half-listening to it was helpful. Still, though, one great song is the only reason for the 3rd star."
2,Technically Very good,"In the track ""Brian Burns meets Ed"" a voice says ""I don't know what's going on here."" this is obvious through the whole album.""Tank"" a biting theme denoting the fast paced action that the film noir theme of the show demands is turned into more of a driving on a cruise tune.""Rain"" is turned into a love song instead of a memory of love lost that won't fade into pain as life goes along. I could give examples for every track, but they would all be the same thing.While the female vocals are excellent, the occasional droppings of the male ""urban street"" vocals are jarring and do not fit at all. Frankly they are as welcome as bodily byproducts in a punch bowl, but not as tasty. The time the ""urban street"" voice tried to sound like a member of the Yakuza, was just pitiful, and probably appeared racist.It is a well produced album with excellent instrumental work and arrangement, but next time, watch the show first."
4,More Fun with Kasey,"Like the Living Things ROM Pack, the Science ROM allows older children to get as much enjoyment and knowledge from Kasey as their younger siblings. A terrific addition to the Kinderbot team - let's hope Fisher Price commits to making more ROMS in the future - geography, arithmetic, grammar and social studies would all be welcome additions."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this for my four year old (Kasey was used at a garage sale, so I bought the cartridge through Amazon.) This toy is kind of 'old school' and wasn't very challenging for my son. My one year old likes the robot just as a toy. Not worth the money; probably why they aren't sold in stores anymore. I wouldn't spend the money again, even if it was used & cheap!"
1,Not the best taste in the world,Would not recommend this product - out of all the multiple brands of goose pate I've tried so far this one tasted the worst.
4,excellent,My previous relationship with CK was her hit album Tapestry. This DVD is very much enjoyable. This 1994 concert has all her hits with an excellent band and great concert hall. The video is top quality and it would become a real jewel if ever released in DTS. TOO BAD no surround sound on this work of art.
4,devine,"This CD was great! It featured many of Carole King's greatest songs. My only negative comment would be that it didn't include ALL of Ms. King's hits from Tapestry. For example if you are a fan of ""Way Over Yonder"", you won't find it on this DVD. However, all fans of Carole King's should find that this DVD is very enjoyable."
5,The GREATEST singer/songwriter ever!,"This concert is awesome. Carole King is a great entertainer, singer, songwriter, actress...well, you get the point! Get this video today, you won't be disapppointed! If you like the Tapestry years or if you like the Colour of Your Dreams years, this is a MUST have!"
3,"Quiet and quick, but not durable enough for heavier skaters","I liked these bearings for the two sessions I used them. They were quiet and rolled a little faster than Bones Reds Bearings. However, I'm a heavy guy, 215 pounds, and after two 2-hour street skating sessions, I had worn pits into the bearing balls and races, rendering the bearings more or less useless. Oh well."
2,Really!,"As one who works in the field of higher education fundraising, I'd say that one theme runs through this book--""the times are changing, and we're damned ticked off about."" While there is some good advice for donors in this book, the premise that seems to underlie this is that neither fundraisers, nor university administrators can be trusted to carry out the wishes of donors. I strongly disagree. The vast majority of gifts to higher education are restricted in nature. By that I mean the donor has designated some purpose which he/she wishes fulfilled. In all but the rare case do institutions violate either the purpose or intent of the donor and consider stewardship to be a solemn pledge to carry out that intent. I don't think this book is particularly helpful in tone or content."
3,Too much technical information,More technical/scientific information about worms than needed for small-scale composting with worms. It was an okay supplement to other books I have read on the topic.
5,Worm Book,Great Book! This book is great to help someone get started with a worm farm. The delivery was speedy! Product came in Excellent shape!
3,Interesting Reading - Use as an extra in your library,"The delivery of the book was superb - Fast, on time and in great shape for a used book. As for the book itself I found it interesting reading, but this is not the Holy Grail of worm farming. The authors did a good job of putting the book together, but I think they overrated themselves a bit. I would recommend this book as a starter book for a library to be used as reference material on worm breeding. I felt the book feel short on illustrations, and information on taking worm breeding to a higher commercial level. All in all I would recommend this book, but like I said earlier, it's not the only reading you should do."
3,Could Have Been Better,"With Heather Hunter in it, I was expecting a whole lot more than I got. This is basically just film with a lot of talking and music videos. It's only about 50 minutes long also. There is a lot of nudity in it and some acts shown. Heather Hunter doesn't get naked even a little bit in it, but she does show that she has skills rapping freestyle though. There are 4 music videos on here that eat up about half the running time of film. Akinyele does lend his foot to science in one scene. This is a must see scene. I was really disappointed by this one. Check out tapes by Luther Campbell. You'll get just as much talking, but a lot more action on his tapes. Its not a bad tape and does have some interesting moments, but I get the feeling the more interesting stuff was cut out of it."
3,"I would hate to see the ""cut"" version","I give it 3 stars for Ak, Heather, and Nore on the same movie.I am really disappointed with the focus of this ""movie"". Don't get me wrong, but I am like AK's biggest fan since the Main Source debut, but I thought this was suppose to be a movie. It reminds me of a watered down Luke release due to the fact it's mostly music videos and soft porn. Room for improvement = more Heather Hunter (not just her as some side kick host, but the ""porn star"" she is)...nah mean?"
2,Confusing read,"In some ways this is a very typical fantasy story, with mighty battles and political intrigue in a medieval setting. But the heroine, Rysana, is a bit more interesting than the usual young and at-first-incompetent protaganist of these sort of stories, and the magic she specialises in was interesting. There are some good ideas and settings in ""The Siege of Arrandin"", but I found the story difficult to follow because of the large cast of characters with confusing names. Also, a lot of the siege itself did not make sense to me from a practical point of view. But there has been quite a gap between this book and its sequel ""The Treason of Dortrean"", so hopefully the author has improved on his writing skills in the meantime."
4,Soccer helper,My son watched this DVD and was able to get a few pointers from it. It's a pretty good DVD.
3,"ok, but just ok","The good news is that if you're a beginner, this is a great and simple way to use the step and work your upper body. The bad news is that it gets really old, really fast. Its a varied basic step joined with differednt upper body weight lift moves. I do like easy, but it really could use some spark."
2,wasn't what i expected,I thought this was going to be just a step video and i was completely wrong. It did have step in it but it was very basic steps. Adding weights to step is ok if that's what you want but I was really looking forward to a challeging step moves.
4,Keeper,"I love Gilad! Some may think this workout doesn't get your heart rate up, and it won't if you don't use heavy enough weights. I'm 53 and use 3 lb weights with this workout and it wears me out. Guys should at least start out with 3-5 lbs and move up as it gets easier. I don't particularly like the toning portion, but the abs workout at the end is a nice addition. When I want a good workout that burns calories, I reach for this one."
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE GILAD!,"I used the video tape of this exercise routine for several years until I wore it out. I started using it when I was very out of shape and unable to use a step. I then progressed to the step, adding on levels, then to weights, and then to heavier weights. As you can tell, this video is great for use from beginners to those experienced enough to use weights while aerobicizing. It is a lot of fun, and I never get bored with it."
2,VERY basic 80's style workout,"This workout is not a step aerobics dvd, rather a strength workout with a basic step up and down added to it. Gilad and his buddies are decked out in 80's style leotards on a beach, which does add humor to your workout. For me, it was WAY too basic and not what I was looking for - I can do bicep curls without a DVD!"
4,"Patience, Rewarded","If you're looking for action, POLICE, ADJECTIVE is probably not the movie for you. But if you're willing to believe that real drama and on-screen tension can be created in the act of opening a dictionary, then here's a movie that might not only capture your attention, but keep you thinking long after the closing credits.It takes a while for that dictionary to be opened, and up till that moment the pace is pretty slow as a Romanian cop tries to resist his orders to arrest a pot-smoking teen, who would face a seven-year jail term for pushing the drugs onto his two friends. The cop has traveled abroad, you see, and he knows the laws in neighboring countries are far less harsh. Why should he ruin a kid's life for doing something that is openly tolerated across neighboring borders? Should he obey his captain or follow his conscience? Who decides? After plodding along for an hour plus, the final showdown - conscience vs. dictionary - is surprisingly gripping."
2,hold the press...this band waxes uhh bad,"Every once in a while you stumble upon a band with little passion and less talent. Looks like this is one of those times. Not to say they're bad, they have their moments. It just seems to me to be a bunch of guys who got together after highschool and out of an immense fear of failure hastily decided, hey lets make a band, and thus recover was born. Maybe its the fact that its a really stupid name for a band, but the overall presentation of the music seems really sloppy, but hey you can't bash a band's first record for being sloppy.It isn't really all bad, its more just a matter of range, there's only so much you can do with a formula of guy who shouts vs. guy who sings vs. offbeat instrumentals.It sometimes leaves me wondering whether the bassist really exists."
2,Blah.,"From what I heard about this band, I had expected something new, exciting, and creative. What I heard was just another immature band trying too hard to be rock stars. These guys need to grow up and get through their MTV wannabe stage. If they can do this, they have a lot of potential."
5,"shut up peter, you aren't even from austin","Before the review gets under way, peter, i'm sure you have no real knowledge of music, you just heard about this band from your friends and when it sounded different from the Foo Fighters and Linkin Park it scared you. Anyways, this is good music, and they are talented, but they don't play in an orthadox way. its like At the Drive-In only harder at the hard parts and softer at the soft parts. fugazi fans will appreciate this too. also check out further seems forever."
4,Intense,"Recover are obviously, blatantly and plainly emo. Not a huge fan of emo myself, I first saw them playing a show, and the energy and band were incredible. I thought to myself, ""I'll have to listen to them some more at home."" I listened to some tracks from this album, and they floored me. The title tracks ""Rodeo"" and ""Picasso"" are intense, and just leave you breathless. Definitely stand out tracks. The rest are still awesome, especially ""Pardon the Wait"" and ""Two Minutes Hate"". If there were more bands like Recover, we'd have an intense, beautiful music industry."
3,relato de car√°cter par√≥dico y sat√≠rico,"Perdido en la Barcelona preol√≠mpica, el extraterrestre Gurb pone al servicio de su supervivencia la extra√±a cualidad de adoptar el aspecto que le plazca. Se pierde con la apariencia de Marta S√°nchez, mientras su compa√±ero alien√≠gena inicia la b√∫squeda en la jungla urbana. Por su diario personal vamos conociendo las incre√≠bles peripecias de un extraterrestre en Barcelona.En este relato de car√°cter par√≥dico y sat√≠rico la invenci√≥n de Eduardo Mendoza convierte la Barcelona cotidiana y absurda en el escenario de una carnavalada. Tras las m√°scaras pintarrajeadas y grotescas se revela el verdadero rostro del hombre urbano actual y, tras el estilo literario, la acerada conciencia art√≠stica del escritor."
5,¬øQu√© hacer si te saltan los ojos en medio de Barcelona?,"Divertido, ameno... hora a hora, minuto a minuto, Gurb sigue sin aparecer, pero !qu√© buenos est√°n los churros!El libro que todo extranjero en Barcelona deber√≠a leer (sobretodo si es su primera visita a la Tierra)."
3,"""In the Year 2525'""","Carl's cover of ""In the Year 2525"" is my favorite thing on the album (it's leagues better than FotN's cover of Roxy Music's ""In Every Dreamhome a Heartache""). I like the original Zager and Evans version up till a point, but Carl's is really kickass. At first, I found it out of place, but now prefer it to the rest of the album.If you read interviews with Carl, it is the astrological and prognosticative aspects of the song that appealed to him."

4,Best for the price,I just need a 67mm CPL filter. It is the best for the price. No doubt about it. But don't expect high quality from this.
1,Worthless Filter,"Not sure who these other folks are that reviewed this thing, but it is absolutely worthless. Buy a decent quality circular polarizer and you'll see what I'm talking about."
5,"Fresh, fun, and fantastic!!!!","The CD is great!!! The lyrics are powerful, full of love, pain, sorrow and energy. The music is a combo of blues, country, a little bit of rock and everything in between. This CD is a favorite with me and my children and is always a request in the car over Nsync and the other ""kiddie bands"" which says alot coming from kids under 10. If you're a fan of country this CD is right up your alley, if you're a fan of blues this CD is right up your alley, whatever your choice of music tastes are, this CD will meet each with a pleasurable sound. I can't wait to hear his next CD and the one after that. Great!"
2,Weak book,"The book started out promising, but took a nosedive soon after. I was bored and uninterested in this book, and I couldn't really connect with any of the characters. It wasn't educational, it wasn't pleasurable, it wasn't ANYTHING but a bunch of words to me. I'll go back to reading Dean Koontz books, because this was just awful."
5,Great Read!,"The story was excellent right down to the reasoning given to the child's night horrors. Losing a parent can cause trama,although this was not the case with Maddie. I pretty much figured out the killer right off but you hate to believe someone with that kind of authority could be the bogeyman. I read many books per month and I think this author is among the best."
4,Pretty good read,"Pretty standard storyline, but a nice twist at the end. I actually did not see it coming until it was there. That was good. While it did not have me trembling in my seat, it was chilling enough to raise some gooseflesh from time to time. She knew when to quit, too, which was also good. Not totally memorable, but a pretty good read."
2,Ghostwritten by Bob Colacello and Pat Hackett,"According to page 208 of the Warhol BiographyHoly Terror: Andy Warhol Close Upby Bob Colacello (1990), Warhol delegated the actual writing of the book to Colacello and Pat Hackett. Colacello wrote the first draft and Hackett wrote the version that was published. Warhol's contribution was to set up the deal, offer a few suggestions and one-liners, and read the finished pages before they were sent off to the publisher. He brought them on his book tour to ""remind him"" what ""he"" had written.If a silkscreen created by Warhol's assistants (carefully aping his art style) but signed by Warhol is still ""authentic,"" does that mean an autobiography written by Warhol's assistants (carefully aping his speaking style) but credited to Warhol on the cover is still an ""authentic"" autobiography?"
5,From A to B and back again!!,"THE Philosophy of Andy Warhol is intensly funny, witty, and real. Andy tells of daily acounts with many super stars and various B's and it just goes to show you that Andy Warhol is a true master mind. This book is true..simple..and as real as you can get. Read it and realize, think, know and understand that you are reading HIS philosophy...it all makes very much sense...if your Andy Warhol."
3,An interesting read but not great,"I agree very strongly with a previous review, ""Excellent but with faults"" by xosa@hotmail.com. To add to this very accurate previous review, I would say that the book is clever and does give some insight into Warhol's life and times. However the cleverness often becomes superficiality. I have read many other biographies of great thinkers (scientists, writers, artists) and find this work by Warhol comparatively unsatisfying. It has the air of someone (who's work is undeniably brilliant) who is hiding behind a facade and does not reveal any of his true thoughts or emotions. I had expected more from the personal philosphy of an artist of his calibre, but all the same this book is entertaining."
5,Andy Aspie?,"Since Warhol's death a condition known as Asperger's Syndrome has come to light. It's named after an Austrian doctor who discovered it in a group of his patients in 1940's. Due to the outbreak of WW2, his research papers remained untranslated, that is, until quite recently. In brief, Asperger's Syndrome can be seen as one of the less severe forms of Autism. Both conditions share many of the same manifestations; an individuals impairment of verbal/social skills, a sensitivity to sensory overload and a comfort found in repetitive actions. Many Aspies are visual problem solvers. Is it possible that Warhol was an Aspie? If this sounds interesting to you, try reading this book along with Elijah's Cup by Valerie Paradiz and see the strong parallels between the two."
2,The Ragady Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to Z and Back Again,"Upon receiving this book ,which I gave as a gift to my sister, I was very disappointed. The book was listed as if it were in decent shape with a few minor imperfections. On the contrary, the book was in pitiful shape. Luckily, it was not the only thing I was giving to my sister. I don't feel like I over paid by too much, but I was expecting a good deal. What I got was less than a fair deal."
5,Great.,Book got here fast and is a great read for any Warhol fan. I would completely recommend to anyone curious about him.
2,ho hum,"this was certainly shallowness raised to the level of . . . pretty much shallowness, I thought. I did enjoy some of the portraits of people, and the fact that Warhol did not forget his origins, but I didn't find him a provocative or towering intellect."
1,Andy warhol,"I bought this due to a need for additional references. It's written by warhols assistant and is filled by drivel, pompousism and things you may say on acid trips while your in a room wrapped in tin foil. Save your money and if you a want book about Andy warhol use one of the autobiographies written by an author after Andy died and has no connection to him or his factory friends."
5,Cord Storage reel,I have many of these holding cords and Christmas lights and they are very easy to use and easily store.
4,Solid and works well,"Bought to hold a 100' 12-3 extension cord. It holds it all, but no room to hold any more. Maybe 150' for a lighter-gauge wire. After tightening the nob screw that shipped loose, I've had not problems with the reel. Solid and well made"
2,Crosswords,"There are a couple really good songs on this album but overall it doesn't begin to compare to a couple earlier releases that are absolutely outstanding. They are ""Crosswords"" and ""aka Lorenzo"". I have collected hundreds of folk, countryfolk, bluegrass, country albums, etc and although these defy strict classification they are a couple of my all time favorites. Very clever upbeat, catchy songs that you can't help singing to yourself all day long. I would beg Amazon to make them available!"
4,disappointed,"I am disappointed in this toy only because I cannot seem to find any other cartridges for the robots. At this time, I do not wish to buy just the french cartridge, I would like Spanish and others also. The french one is the only one I can find in the stores and online. I also have Toby the todbot, and the situation is the same. Had I known I would not be able to purchase other cartridges, I would NOT have purchased the robots!!!!"
3,Moderate Workout for a light day of exercise,"Alas, another moderate workout. I have been on the perpetual search for a workout that actually gets my heart racing into the cardio zone and this is just another one of those workouts that is left to the physically challenged. Sure there is the typical punching sequence, the kicks and complex sequences; unfortunately, if you exercise more than 3 times a week you will not find this DVD challenging. Why doesn't a hardcore workout exist on DVD? I don't know. Perhaps someone has the answer. Until then, I will be forced to do my own workout at home. Perhaps I will make a video someday that doesn't have an instructor that acts like they are having a great time when really they should be more focused on giving you a good workout. So in my search for a good workout, I'm afraid that this is not it. Hardcore it is not."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Regardless of your level of fitness, this workout is impossibe to follow as it is fast paced with little or no cues."
5,The Best Special Situation Book,"Awful title. Great book. This is not for beginners. While this is an easy read, the application of the various strategies requires solid knowledge of finance, accounting and capital markets.The case studies, which are easily readable (even entertaining), are part of what makes this book fantastic. Greenblatt examines special situations in which he has participated and breaks down the various considerations, risks and rewards.Anyone looking to do a lot of homework for the prospects of outsized returns should pick up a copy."
2,Not Much There,"As someone who has read dozens of investing books over the past 25 years, this one will not stay on my shelf. The best advise he provides is to study the teachings of Benjamin Graham, something that is common knowledge to nearly every investor.One way to judge the popularity of a book is by the price it commands on the used market. If you must read it, Amazon currently has numerous used copies available for under 4 bucks."
5,A Great Help for all Investors,"The author has had experience in most areas of investing. He speaks clearly and gives proof of his investments. Most investors will benefit greatly from reading this well organized book. The author tells of ""risky"" investments (he stays away from them) and he tells of profitable ideas that the big investors tend to ignore. These are the items that help the individual investor."
1,Dated and Dumb,"I bought this because a couple of hedge fund managers in an article picked it as their best stock market book. I can only conclude that they must be personal friends of the author. The book is extremely lightweight stating what is completely obvious and lacking any real, useful insight. As other reviews have pointed out, the examples are from twenty years ago and can only be interesting to someone looking back at market history, not currently investing. I could continue at some length in this vein, but I trust the reader gets the point. Skip this book, it is of no use in today's market."
5,ONE OF THE BETTER BOOKS ON INVESTING,"I read stock market investment books like some cooks read cookbooks-- for a new idea that can change the recipe and make the outcome a better success. I received several good ideas from this book. It is a keeper. I would also recommend the three (or or there more?) books by R. Max Bowser who has an unique system where he even guarantees $5,000 if the reader does not make a profit using his system. Mr. Bowser states that he has refined his investment system on an ongoing basis (adding improvements) over the past 20 years (Take a glance at Mr. Bowser's book, ""Guaranteed Profits With Small Stocks""). There are so many good investment books out there and the serious investor should keep up with the new books to have a stream of fresh new ideas."
1,waste of time,You won't make money from reading this book. You will likely lose money. Its old outdated 80's ideas. Seriously buy a CD from a bank. At least you won't get burnt.
4,useful information and enjoyable writing,"This book discusses about special situation investment. The author presents the subjects with a very accessible (humorous) writing style that I like it.Usefully, the author explains different topics with case studies. I learned from those examples.Even though, I don't think I would be able to utilize ideas in this book in near future. And, the special situation investment is not suitable for everyone. Just like there is no one life style is suitable for everyone. However, just by understanding this investment approach can broaden my view on investment.Conclusion: my time and money are well spend on this book."
4,Insightful,"For investor with some knowledge and experience who wants to consider some new investing theories. Very well written. Breezy style, great sense of humor, clear explanations, including examples. Accessible to non-professional."
2,Didn't Get Anything,"This book was well recommended by investors, and so I purchased it, but was eventually disappointed. The ideas are a bit basic / common sense if you work in the industry; for example, spin-offs on average outperform as is common knowledge, but what about the counter-examples, such as the Verizon spin-offs which went bankrupt. Also, when going through his thought process on why he purchased a stock, his arguments had holes in them (sounded too much like useless sell-side research arguments). I was rather disappointed; instead of this, pick up One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch or Essays of Warren Buffett by Cunningham."
4,"Easy, entertaining reading while learning something new","Although much of this book is not for everyone, as some of the investment strategies discussed are too complex, it certainly doesn't detract from the entertainment value. Besides, even if you're not going to go out and start trading LEAPS, it's fun and easy to find out what they are and how they work. I think sometimes he glosses over details (such as ""don't try this without many hours of research"" -- but research what?) but if he really covered all the necessary info the book would become long and dry. He does a great job in explaining things simply and clearly and in a fun way. Most investors will learn something from this book and everyone should be entertained."
5,My other favorite book,"I know the title of the book sounds like a joke but it's a great book. In fact, it is my favorite investment book after Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders. Joel Greenblatt takes you to investing areas that aren't followed closely by Wall Street and help you make money at the same time.I am also a sucker for investment books that are fun to read and doesn't cause me to feel like I'm chewing glasses. This doesn't mean this book isn't top-notch! For what it's worth, I would've probably pay over $50 for this gem."
3,Only for the left wrist,"I like the color and it is beautiful, but it fits only in the left wrist (because of its design). Unfortunately I use watch only on right wrist."
4,RFrancis(Trini),Swanky sporting watch..got a true fit.I even purchased the gold its slightly different but just as nice.
2,Not pleased with the aesthetics,"I really liked the watch as it looked in the picture. But, when I purchased it, I realized that its way too shiny. If you have a thin wrist, then the watch looks really bulky. Besides, the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north. So, you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time...I am going to return this watch..."
1,Two hours that I'll never get back!,"I ALWAYS finish a book. Well, I can't claim that any longer. What made the author think that this main character was worth writing about....or reading about. She is selfish, ignorant, clueless, mean to what few friends she was, and unrepentant for her mistakes! Not my idea of a heroine! I have known some narsasistic people, but there was no redeeming qualities to this character. I enjoyed the previous book's humor, but found this book was just wasting my time. Skip it and go to the 3rd book in the series. That's my advise."
4,She's such a find!,"I'm ashamed not having heard about Mrs. MacAlister before, while the first book I read was written in 2003! I think she is inordinately funny and I read her with giggles and a smile. She's rather literate which might not find appreciation with some people, but for me she's a find!"
1,terrible story line,"u know whati really wanted this writer to write about nick and thom from the secound book rather than this annoying heroini think it would be a far better story than this oni never got into it , it was that bad"
4,You just have to love the main character,"This author creates a very endearing male character. The book is well written with a fluid style, witty dialogue and situations and a believable cast of characters. Fun read."
1,Not in my destiny to finish this book,"This book started off where Noble Intentions left off, which I thought might be promising, as the former book had some good moments before it started devolving into total ridiculousness. I quickly realized the problem with Noble Destiny is that it never takes off on its own feet. MacAlister loves the long-winded banter and comebacks between characters -- the humor is forced and tedious after the 3rd or 4th go around between Dare and Batsfoam, and Charlotte's malapropisms are an overdone joke. I got the impression MacAlister had a deadline to meet in getting this book out, and this ended up being a pile of piffle I could no longer suffer through. Still in all MacAlister can write when she puts her mind to it; she just needs to stay focused on her characters and story line. Right now this story is just too silly and rangy to be even half funny or entertaining."
3,She's no Gillian!!!,"Quite honestly Char is the most annoying thing that has set foot on pages!! She is so vain and her destruction of words is not in the least charming. And the way she used Carolina was just sad. At first I was barely getting through the book however Batsfoam saved the day! I was definitely disappointed after thoroughly enjoying the first book, although I am keeping hope alive for the third installment."
3,"Read ""Noble Intentions"" First","If you are thinking about reading this, may I please suggest that you try ""Noble Intentions"" first? It is 100%funny and way more clever. I will not say this book isn't worth a read, (especially for just 99 cents) but I don't think you will ever re-read it again.This is a fairly typical and very,very predictable story of a young and beautiful widow in desperate need of a new husband. A widow that just can't accept her standing in the ton has been tarnished by her very foolish act. And of course her new husband can't be just any old man...no he has to be young, rich and handsome.The only twist to this book is that the man who has to marry her ( Alasdair) is holding out for love in his marriage and will do whatever it takes to get it.These two characters were introduced in ""Noble Intentions"" and several more of them will reappear in ""Trouble With Harry"""
2,"Well, K.M. is no Barbara Metzger","This book ended up being annoying more than intertaining. The author tried too hard to be funnny, forcing upon us endless dialogue of the same thing."
2,Not that great,"Lots of repetitions, over use of adjectives, not too funny humour, all together a disappointing read."
1,WHY!!! (a bit of a rant),"I want this book so badly it hurts! I tried ordering it a few weeks ago and was really excited about getting it. I waited, and waited until finally I had to check my account to see what was the hold up and it said my order had been canceled. Apparently the seller didn't have the book in stock. I was so disappointed. I also noticed that since my order it seems the prices for this book has gone through the roof. Are people expecting to get rich quick by selling books on the internet or something? I am sure this is a awesome book but I can not see myself paying over forty dollars for a fourteen dollar book."
3,Too primitive,"I was quite disappointed with this book. Included patterns and templates were, well, great if you are in a 5th grade. Some designs were simply tasteless (wrapping a gift in a bubble-wrap - oh please!). I was also expecting to see more techniques for making bows and gift accessories, but there were mostly instructions on how to make boxes and some hideous fabric bags. And does anyone really need 10 introductory pages and 2 pages about the types of ribbons in a 100-page book?Don't expect to impress anyone except your Mom and Grandma, who will like almost anything you do anyway."
2,"""Taken To The Cleaners""","The description of this product is very deceiving. It led me to believe that it is an (8) pack of clothes. To date I have only received a (4) pack. The colors are very nice on the cloth side, however on the scrubber side some of the holes are cut or not stitched properly. Save your money...go to ""the dollar store""."
4,Pleasing approach to exploring Spanish for budding Spanish students,"As a Spanish teacher I am always looking for ways to offer my students current expressions of the language that are not overwhelming for the beginers and still interesting for the more advanced students. This book offers poetry that explores basic verbs sensually, emotionally, passionately-and decently(I hate to censor anything, but, as a teacher, must be prudent when chosing materials for my classroom istruction.)."
4,Many errors but a touching book,"This book mirrors the one that HBO did on Last Letters Home. I have issues with him bringing Jessica Lynch up during the chapter about the 507th Soldier who was found dead a few days after the attack. He mentions her twice on the page and I feel that took away from the deceased Soldier's story. Also, the author should have had someone with military rank knowledge edit his book. The rank is Private First Class not Private, First Class which he writes all the time. Also there are several inconsistencies in dates which could drive a reader nuts. The last letter home was written 10 years before the Soldier died??? Or was written 6 days after the soldier died??? His editor needs to be fired!"
5,Love it!,This pen writes like a dream. Very smooth and consistent lines whether writing manuscript or cursive. It is very light and responsive making it an easy tool for everyday extended use.
4,Nice.,"For the price it's great. The assembly was intuitive and clean. (I was sort of expecting trouble at this price.) It isn't completely smooth all the time, only at a very limited angle. (Irrelevant, but I find my handwriting worse using the fountain pen - maybe I just need to get used to it.)"
3,It's plastic!,"So I had no idea this pen was plastic when I bought it. So, being plastic it's ~very~ light. All my other fountain pens are Parkers and those are pretty heavy, so never having had a Lamy before, the weight startled me. Not to say it's not a good pen, it's fine. Just don't purchase this thinking you'll have something with heft in your hand.Other than that: The broad nib is nice, it gives a smooth thick line that I like. I use it with a grass green ink and it looks very striking. If you plan to use this with bottled ink don't forget to purchase a converter. The pen comes with one cartridge...I think it was blue."
3,No Instructions and the cartridge instead of an inkwell.,I like the way the pen writes. I would rather save money by using a pen that I can refill. I had to use something to try to refill with the ink i bought here at amazon. NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to insert cartridge properly.
4,When lefties write from left to right,Lamy pen - goodIf it works for you - recommendedIf not - there are people that are a hot mess with a fountain pen - just sayingnot blaming lefties - they are all right ....
5,Exquisite,"This stories are wonderfully written, I loved specially Pat Califia's writing style, excellent buy...."
4,It was,pretty hot. Some of the stories seemed a little outdated but others were pretty good. The other books in the series were better but still a decent reccomendation.
3,"50/50 ""Best Of""","I enjoy these books. I have them starting in '98. In all of the books, I feel I get my monies worth, BUT there always writings in each book that I do not enjoy. The eclectic collection has something for everyone, so you are sure to enjoy some of what you read IF not all. I recommend the collection for Lesbian Erotic fans. I hope you enjoy."
3,1 Review,"They were okay and enticing to watch as a 4 part series. The scale and effort of the journey were well conveyed. It was also interesting to see how it was done. The only criticism I would have was that the modern day context of the journey was not altogether cohesive. I thought the participants were a bit far removed from the context of this 21st Century re-enactment of the Trail and members of the group tended to choose whether they were in the past or in the future. Basically apart from the odd group dynamics thingies, fine."
3,Loooooooooved it!,"I teach a preschool class of five 2-year-olds. Needless to say, I have used every activity in this book! I hesitated to stuff socks with newspaper but, ""Harry"" is the favorite toy. Great ideas with sound developmental pacing. I can't wait for them to turn three so I can get the next book."
5,A great book!,"A friend of mine gave me this book when my son turned three. As a teacher and parent, I have found this book to be very helpful. There are activties for each month of the year. All of the activities that I have tried have been a huge success. From fingerpainting, to sorting and matching, to talking about the seasons, I have not only enjoyed playing with my son, but he has learned new skills from these activities. I also appreciate that the craft projects are easy to figure out and require materials that I already have in the house! A great book for anyone looking for fun and creative activities to do with their child."
4,Moves quickly,"I like this book. It is well-organized and contains all of the material you need (other than the CD or tape) to start fiddling. It discusses each of the scales and gives an illustration of the fingering for each note on each scale. It does help, however, to have some introduction to the violin before you start this book. Also, the book moves very quickly from very basic fiddling to pretty complex techniques. There are 36 lessons and time signatures and pick-up notes appear in Lesson 7, while double stops appear in Lesson 13. Nevertheless, I was able to work through the first part of the book and found it an enjoyable experience."
1,3 Months and DEAD,"I placed a lot of critical data on this external drive thinking it may be a reliable backup solution. Boy was I wrong. Now I need to find a way to get this think repaired and I'm sure I'm not going to get any technical support or an RMA or pretty much anything. Personally, I would avoid."
1,Intrusive. One of the worst soundtracks ever made.,"The 'Club Foot Orchestra"" seem to believe that they are the stars of this movie.I heard them perform this track live. It was intrusive, annoying, and consistently upstaged SHERLOCK JUNIOR, one of the funniest and best movies ever made.Do yourselves a favor: if you get the DVD of the movie, put on another soundtrack when you play it. This one is just appalling."
2,-need this much power? buy a corded,"This drill is a heavy, monster of a bad idea. The 18v is really on the edge of being oversized, (I LOVE mine, best ever) but this thing is just plain uncomfortable. So much torque you need two hands, so much weight you will need two hands. TOO MUCH MONEY TO SPEND ON A DRILL THAT WORKS WELL IN SUCH A LIMITED NUMBER OF JOBS. Maybe a pro could find a couple more uses for this, but concrete and steel are the only uses I could figure, and for concrete, you best apt to get the dw004, of which I'm very pleased.18v is way big enough."
5,This book spoke to me,"I read this book and loved it. I loved that it was written from the non-farmer perspective. It helps me see things a bit better from my wife's perspective. I am hoping to be the farmer and my wife loves some of the aspects of my dream, but is wary of others. I appreciated Catherine's honesty and openness about their life and struggles, how hard it was to set boundaries and the struggle with the third ""person"" in their marriage. I have read the next book top and really enjoyed it. I started knitting as a result. (I am usually the only male in our knitting circle.) I would love to read her partner's story too."
3,Satisified my farm lust.,This book was a quick read. I now think twice about wanting my own farm. For fans of the Beekman boys-this won't compare.
1,Lesbian seeking approval,"When I look for a farming book, I do not wish to read a lesbian love story. Sharing an underwear drawer???????Their idea of harvesting their chickens is taking them elsewhere for processing. CHICKENS!!!!!!Couldn't bring myself to finish this book, just not worth it.I'm glad I checked this out of the library, instead of buying it.If I could give a negative star, I would."
4,YES YOU CAN- WEIGHT WATCHERS PRO ENCOURAGES YOU ON YOUR WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY-INFORMATION & CHUCKLES,OK- the program material is outdated BUT THIS BOOK IS SO ENCOURAGING ABOUT THE WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!If you are attending Weight Watchers-- this is a good pick me up- if you miss a meeting- read a chapter of this book-- if you don't want to go near a Weight Watchers meeting-- read a few pages.. it will encourage.. make you laugh and help you with realistic goals that are attainable-- and to stop beating yourself up-- and most important.. smile.. and perhaps..succeed. Could certainly be used with another Weight loss or fitness program. This book is very practical & down to earth( and gave me a lot of smiles.. wow was that great--especially when reading about weight loss/food etc.. so many books are so dry.. and well.. boring). Worth the price--thank you Rosalie.
4,"Highly overlooked game. Violent, with lots of puzzles.","Strangly, this game is overlooked. It continues the story of Kain, in a sequel to the old Playstation game, BLOOD OMEN. Graphics are very nice, and there is quite a bit of detail in all of the levels. A lot of the game, however, consists of puzzles. Too many of them have you pushing around crates to open up a path. However, the game is on the long side, so it will keep you busy for a while.This game is a port from the PS2/XBOX original. If you already own it, this Gamecube version has nothing new, besides having a better controller. There is a new area, but it is hard to tell apart. As before, there is a small pause to load when you reach the second half of a level. It is not really annoying, though.Overall, this game is very good. I highly recommend buying it."
4,fun but short,"This is a must have game if your into the whole Kane series. Even if your not into the the whole kane/soul reaver series this is still simply a fun game to play. The puzzels are not that challeging at all but the fighting and game play are a blast. The bosses on the other hand can be difficult until you find their weakness but once you do it is like taking candy from a baby. If your looking for a challenging game I wouldn't recomened this one but if your looking for a fun game that allows you to fight in a mythalogical time, against powerfull and strange creatures, go for it.graphics- 4-5game play- 4-5puzzels and difficulty- 3-5length- 3-5"
2,Lots of Chops but aint sayin' much,"The tunes are cool but the guitar playing is just a bunch of fast notes. The rhythm section is tight, but jimmy offers little in the form of interplay to my ears. I dont hear any artistry here, just a bunch of fast for fast sake guitar solos. the saxophone is much more interesting to me. To be fair, Jimmy is known for his fast picking, so if that's what you're looking for, look no further otherwise, keep shopping."
5,Icepond Rocks... Much..,"Sunset Valley is probably the best thing to ever come out of Portland... they've got wonderfully popish hooks, psycadelic in some respects-- lots of reviews will compair them to David Bowie or The Pixies (huge compliments in my opinion, of which the band is deserving) but they are really something that is more of an evolution of what the affor mention acts pioneered.That said, Icepond, on the date i'm writing this, is their latest release, and also their greatest. There is not a single throw away track on this CD.Opening with the melodic, yet short 'Say Ow', on to a song that reminds me a bit of Pavement, only with more focus 'Iron Men'...i could list out every track and why i love it, but no one has time to read it, and i dont have time to write it.You do have time to buy this album though... your honestly missing out on an amazing CD if you dont."
4,revised version,"I have not yet read the book in its entirety, its for a class, but I expect the revised version of the book to include events that the last one missed out on."
1,Bad Journalists book,"This book is horrible. Basically a vacuous stream of consciousness motif that raises more questions than answers, but not thought provoking questions, just: what if this / what if that / I think this / others think that / and the latest poll X says 17% of Russians believe Y.Reading the editorials at Moscow Times dot com would be better.Further, it does not cover events post January 2003.I believe this author is known within Russia as a sort of intellectual. If this is the quality of Russian scholarship, then indeed Russia has no future. Maybe something was lost in the translation?"
1,If you want history dont read this...,"What this book does not cover. How did Putin get in office? The country was getting ready to elect a communist government. How did he gain an advantage? Corruption. How is he corrupt, GO into that please. The only way you can be in charge of Russia is with the US help. Please tell the real story please."
4,"I would like to give 5 stars, just for the track ""Argentyna"".","This is another record where several titles should be put into the ""ECM Scrapbook"" (for a definition see my comments under Bobo Stenson's ""Serenity""). But the last title of the CD, ""Argentyna"", is overwhelming, and some others are quite good as well. Unfortunately Dino Saluzzi gets too little exposure with his bandoneon, however, he sparkles in ""Argentyna""."
4,A nice review title,"If you are looking for a title to quickly review your basic and clinical concepts in endocrinology and better focus your studies, then you will be glad to put your hands on this book. It even recommends you some review articles on each subject at the end of the chapters."
5,great,great for hennah adjustable tips for very fine detail works great very satisfied would buy again or recommend to friend
5,Great product!,I purchased these for my daughters who enjoy applying henna to themselves and friends. It was great to have the different sizes of tips to allow for different designs. It was well packaged and easy to use.
3,"Great, but hard on the hand","I ordered the 4 bottle/5 tip combo.It came with 4 bottles: two 1 oz and two 1/2 oz; four plastic squeeze-tops (which the metal tips screw onto.), four plastic caps (to store extra henna), and five metal tips.Pros:-The tips come in a very nice variety of sizes. However, I have yet to use the largest or smallest tip.-The 1/2 bottles are perfect for small applications.Cons:-The bottles become pretty painful to squeeze after a while. (I got these to replace some other bottles I had, hoping they would be easier. They were not.)-The necks of the bottles are very narrow, making loading very difficult.All in all, I got what I expected fr $14, but I will consider buying/making cones next time, as I can't seem to find bottles that aren't painful to use in long sessions."
4,Buenos aplicadores,"Compre este kit por las agujas para poder hacer los tatuajes de henna con mayor detalle que con el cono aplicador y poder variar el grosos de la l√≠nea sin problema, pero las botellas son un poco duras y luego de un tiempo me canso sobre todo el dedo pulgar, tengo otras botellas que son mas blanditas pero no les funciona la tapa de las agujas. pero en general hacen lo que necesito."
4,Nice value for money,I combed the whole internet and this was the best deal so far.it does its job nicely.but make sure you sift your henna paste very very well otherwise it will never go through the holes.Good deal!
3,"Really a ""child's first"" book of virtues?",I have both this and Bennet's Book of Virtues and I always choose to read Bennet's over Hunter's book. I seem to be able to find stories that my younger children enjoy in Bennet's book. The pictures are a nice addition to this book and the stories correlate well with the lesson being taught. I felt the only thing about this book being a child's first book of virtues is that there is only 100 stories and poems so it is a small volume.
5,My childhood,"I remember being read this book over and over again as a kid and it has helped me become a better person. Even if you're not Christian, like myself, you and your kids can take so much away from this. In it's purest form, the book teaches how to be a good person; how to share, to be kind to others and other such lessons. ""The Bear Who Didn't Care"" is probably the story that has stuck with me the most. It taught me as a kid to teat others with the kind of kindness and respect that I want and I think this is an important for any child to learn. So, whether you're a Christian or not, I definitely taking a look at this one. I guarantee it won't disappoint."
1,Piece of crap,This replacement lamp for my JVC ILP HDTV was touted by the seller as being superior to the original. It is anything but. It last just a few months or about one 4th of the projected hours it was rated. I tried several times to contact the seller but I've been completely ignored. I would urge anyone shopping for a TV lamp to avoid this one and this merchant.
1,Does not measure accurately!,The device I received sometimes measures acurately and sometimes it does not. The one wheel falling over often causes the measurements to be off. I do not recommend this device.
4,Flip grip multi-tool,"while viewing the many different multi-pliers here to find a replacement for my sears craftsman slip joint multi- plier that is no longer available I found these. For the price I decided to give it a try. I am very impressed how they are holding up. I just wish the jaws would open a little wider to tighten the bonnets on some of the larger valve stems. That's just me being lazy though. I got spoiled not having to make additional trips to the van when i started using these multi-tools. The wire strippers and wire cutter works great, these have a magnet for the driver tip not to fall out- great feature! These are on my belt and are with me on every service call. Can't beat these for the price!"
5,Great little multi-tool for the price.,"I like it. I do ATM repair work, and this goofy little tool allows me to leave my ""real"" tools out in the parking lot 9/10 of the time. It has a much higher build quality and feel than the price would lead you to expect.I'd buy another in a heartbeat if this one disappeared."
3,OK tool,"This tool is ok at best , I will say the pliers and construction seem to be high in quality. And if you need these two style of pliers frequently the it's gonna be alot handier for you . The screwdriver works ok but the other implements included are of less use and hard to get unfolded to use . You have to pry them out to use them which takes time! The knife is not sharp and very small. I would only suggest for certain uses ,not a good all around multi-tool."
1,Blind squash,Lenses fog up within 10 minutes of play. Not worth the price. Look for anti-fog lenses in your purchase of squash/racquetball eyewear. Otherwise it could be dangerous play.
1,BOO for Booda Burger,"This is a good size plush squeaker toy. The seams are poorly stictched and came apart in several places within 20 minutes of light play. We play with several other plush squeaker toys, and most of them are still intact. Once the stuffing was exposed, I had to remove the stuffing and the squeaker. So now I'm left with a flat hamburger that is not very interesting to my dog. Almost anything will be a better buy. Consider Kong - they are great and have replaceable squeakers."
5,Not only for actors,"Though I am not an actor, I always admired the craft and wanted to know more about what an actor goes through. I also wanted to learn some of the skills actors use to create and project a persona so that I could use them in my business and personal life. Following some of the advice and techniques in this book awakened the thespian in me. I found application of the advice extrodinarily helpful when giving presentations, for example, and even in regular conversation. I especially enjoyed the practice of studying my environment, notepad in hand, and jotting notes on what I see, hear, smell, touch and taste. I am much more aware of my surroundings as a result.Auditioning is not only for actors. We all face a audition of some sort now and then. This book helped me have a greater chance of ""getting the part""."
3,Disappointing,"Although the new formula has less offensive (to the people that don't like the smell...) smell than other liniments on the market, it doesn't quite work as well for my family as the original formula. Still worth a try tho'. I'm not quite sure when Watkins changed the formula, maybe late 2010 or early 2011. The ""red"" linimentJ R Watkins Natural Pain Relieving Red Liniment - 11 Oz, 2 Packhas a more obvious smell, is harder to apply than this cream, but seems to work better. Every ""body"" is different tho, and what may not work for us, may indeed work better than what you are currently using."
1,No help at all,"Having liked other Watkins products, especially the foot lotion, I tried this for pain from myofascitis. The smell is horrible, but I would have put up with it if it worked, but it did nothing at all for pain. Back to my Icy Hot."
3,Liniment,"I was replacing a bottle I've had for a while. I noticed the ingredients have changed dramatically. The original bottle was basically turpentine, not all this stuff. Was not as effective. Why did they change the recipe?"
3,watkins white cream liniment,"It is o.k. but if you are truly looking for pain relief, this is not the one to buy. It does not relieve the pain as much as watkins red pain relief liniment."
5,Balanced Evaluation,"This is a sane, balanced, biblical, and irenicevaluation of the early years of the CharismaticMovement. Dr. Culpepper was my theology professorand mentor and demonstrated the above characteristicsin class. This book is still very useful. Any timeI preach or teach on the Holy Spirit this is oneof the volumes that I find on my desk.Culpepper wrote this book after experiencing aspiritual renewal after coming into contact withcharismatic Christians in Japan. This book isa theological reflection on that experience andthe Charistmatic Movement at that time. Highlyrecommended."
2,Not too different from other war diaries I have read,"This story is not much different from similar diaries andaccounts I have read about other peoples pacifist accounts inconflicts such as in Korea, Indo-China and Lebanon. The same pacifistattitudes and vibes filter through. Reading Tim Judah's (a prolificwriter of anti-Serb texts) introduction was enough for me to knowwhere this book was heading."
1,just adjusting number 1s comment,this game is okay as it is (the only reason im doing this is because my friend klyer.)Scott rogusta here is not right at all you guys (even kids like me that are 8 years old really on graphics). ;) so Scott 'fancy' makes realisam stand out like call of duty (check that out peoples)which is 'fancy' and realistic at the same time. ta ta for now folks!
1,Junk,"Unless you have a high end video card (128MB isn't enough), you'll shell out for nothing. Buy Delta Force Trilogy, you'll have a better chance despite it's quirky graphics."
5,One of the greatest games ever,"Ghost recon is a fine example of just how great Tom Clancy games are. It is a shooter and a strategy game *Which I Enjoy*. The game has a unique storyline and has some of the best gameplay I have ever got hooked on. In single player you command a team of men (You may customize weapons ect.) Then you go out and do what you gotta do. In multiplayer, it's you and you're friend against the world. The game is best played on it's hardest setting (Elite) it will remove radar and all the cheapo stuff and give the enemies great A.I. So run down to the nearest store and buy it right now."
3,Much better on P.C.,"Ghost Recon was not made for the PS2. Although the graphics are better then the computer version, but the controls are very frustrating and the game is easier because your cross hair turns red when you target an enemy. Ghost Recon for PS2 is not bad, but it is not great either. If you have a choice, get this game for the computer."
1,Another god-awful Tom Clancy game,"The only good Tom Clancy game is SPlnter Cell, a game like this is simply too real to be fun, you control all members of your squad, but one at a time,and you're dead a few minutes in because you get shot, then you have to spend three men to find out where the shooter is and another one to actually kill him, and the graphics suck, keep off of this game."
3,"Not in my top 100 games, but pretty good","A fun game, with good graphics and sound. ""Radar"" showing positionsof friendly, neutral, and enemy units is silly and makes game tooeasy at times. Enemy units are often excellent shots with a lotof ammo, but they don't seem too bright. Anti-tank weapons areremarkably effective. Overall, is quite playable, ... Like all of the Clancy games, it feels alot like a recruiting tool for the military and/or CIA."
4,Ghost recon: Greatest Army game ive ever played.,"I recently played the demo for ghost recon on pc. I thought that it was a great game. It is the best army game i have ever played, and one of the best shooters. The graphics are really sweet but the movment isnt that great. The enemys move poorly but that is my only complaint with this game. Its great. What you do basicly is construct an A team and a B team and control one of the teams to compleat the objectives. So you have 6 lives because you can switch people everytime you die. The game itself it hard at first but when you get the hang of it its great. If you are looking for a great war game choose this. In my opinion and in all of my freinds opinions, this game is better then Medal Of Honor: Frontline. As an owner of Frontline i am not saying it is a bad game but i think that Ghost Recon is much much better. This game is a must have for the holidays."
3,Vocie Commands?,"This game would be great...except that I have played SOCOM. The game has great features and is very realistic. However, I don't feel I am a part of the game. For example, there are no voice commands for this game. So, after playing an hour it got old very quickly. Well, there are no commands. Period. The only three are ""hold,"" ""assault,"" and ""advance at all costs.""Plus, it is difficult to keep track of your team. There is also no ""regroup"" feature if your team gets separated. This makes it extremely difficult to keep track of your team members if your are trying to perform dual missions.Very good game but could have been a better."
4,Good for the money,"The scale gives you a decent weight for coins, and for the price you could not ask for much more."
4,Great Service,"The item came quickly after I ordered it. It is exactly what I expected, however I have not watched it yet."
1,Typical Baywatch stuff on the high seas!,This is really trashy stuff - but it IS Baywatch. Not being a Baywatch fan (we only bought this as we were on the cruise ship on our honeymoon whilst they were filming this!) I am probably not being objective.The video is really only good for forwarding to shots of the beautiful Dawn Princess!
4,Music to my ears,"I've used the Dewalt DW911R radio & battery charger daily for the past couple months, and it has performed great. The radio really works well and tunes in all my stations. The battery charger also is excellant, and causes no interference with radio(a problem I had with other radios) Best of all, the radio can be run using your Dewalt battery, great for roofing, power outages and out boating/fishing. Radio is also built tough."
4,I like it,Oregon chains for my saws have never disappointed me. I'm looking next for a oregon bar but the best deals are not always found online.
4,"Delbert always fun to listen to, here is no different","Delbert McClinton has one of those great bluesy voices that sounds so ""regular"" that you think you could do it, but in reality its got a depth and quality that is hard to match. On this album he really has some fun, and that howl is unmistakable. Sending Me Angels is a personal fave with him getting help from country greats Vince Gill on vocals and Lee Roy Parnell on slide guitar. Old Weakness calls to mind the fun lovin Stones classic honkytonk woman. and Leap of Faith cheesy as it might sound can perk up a dreary day with no problem."
5,the best!!!!!,"Getting the best of Delbert McClinton and friends is just about as good as it gets!!! There is not even 1 marginal cut on this CD. I feel energized, amused and thoroughly treated every time I enjoy this CD. Which I do often. Thanks Delbert and friends."
3,Cant speak to the contents but the cover photo scares me alot!,"Unless the young lady pictured has a constitution of stone, filling your water bottle from a running stream these days is a quick way to ruin your trip pronto! While there are probably still places where water runs clean enough to pull this trick, and some people are less apt to be affected by nasties in the water than others, The practice on this cover is very ill advised.So if I have not even opened the book how can I review it? I can't directly, but if the author/publisher show this little common sense splashed across the cover, what kind of info are they going to dispense inside? Was this just an editorial blunder and in no way reflects on the content? I will leave that for someone else to decide, and I look forward to that review."
1,"Late, poorly treated obviously preopened, crushed bent product and inner boxes, no paperwork, nadda?","Dear Sirs,Probably the most dissatisfied with an order that I have ever been. I paid for next day shipping, the item arrived 2 days short of a week later. The outer USPS container was in Excellent Condition. The two inner boxes were preopened, crushed, contained no instructions or hardware, and one of the units was bent and twisted sideways. I probably will not ever attempt to use these or even see if they work as they obviously have been mishandled. In the nearly a week time that I spent waiting for this ""next day"" delivery, I found better professionally packaged, units at a more reasonable price. First time, ""LAST TIME"" customer"
3,But not that close...,"CLOSER TO THE SPIRAL is a tribute to Nine Inch Nails that focuses on the industrial rock of the 90's.The bands involve in this compilation are pretty unknown, even for NIN fans.The songs that stand out in this CD are 'Perfect Drug' covered by Nerve Factor featuring Sarah Fairless and 'Something I Could Never Have' by Chiasm.The rest just aren't that fresh or powefull enough to surpass NINs version of each of the the songs.I recomend CLOSER TO THE SPIRAL only to industrial rock fans or NIN die hard followers.laternexus"
1,Flesh Field ruined it for me,The rest of this cd was ok i guess. Nothing really stood out aside from the Heresy cover. I liked it at first but after some time it grew on me in a bad way and I totally lost interest in the band and this tribute.
2,Superficial guide to las vegas,"I found this book pretty annoying. On the one hand, it gives a good overview of vegas and some interesting facts. But trying to use it while we were there, we found it almost never gave enough information to be useful. In particular, we tried to use the guide to find restaurants, and found the one-sentence-long reviews of restaurants severely lacking. If anything they sound like advertisements. Here's a random example: ""At Samba Brazilian Steakhouse, skewered rotisserie meats are roasted over coals at the open kitchen, then carved table side with machete-like knives."" That's the complete treatment of that restuarant! OK, so at a steak house they roast meats -- duh! Are they any good? Should I go there? Is it better than anywhere else? Is it expensive? This information is very typical of the level of detail in the book."
5,A model of scholarly writing,"Jotham Parsons is a historian's historian: erudite, precise, and careful, yet able to express himself in language which shimmers with wit, clarity, and subtly surprising insight. The Church in the Republic is Parsons at his best; this is an indispensible work for those with an interest in Renaissance France, and an edifying and entertaining read for anyone else."
4,Good quality game,"This game was very mindless but addictive, especially in multiplayer. The gore wasn't too bad since you have a faraway view, but the boss monsters were very gruesome. It still doesn't matter much since it is not much of a horror game, like Resident Evil, where it is very tense and disturbing. This game is more of a fun party game to play with your friends. The characters were cool, each with their own magic, ranged, and melee moves. I like Martyr the best with her cool knives and duel pistols. The hordes of zombies are much more fun to kill with friends. Not much of a single player game."
4,An alright multiplayer experience.,"This game is like Gauntlet, Xmen legends, ultimate alliance, shrek 2, and fantastic 4 rise of the silver surfer. You (and up to 3 other friends) can control up to 4 players on the same screen. The graphics are rather poor and the foreground can get in the way. The later levels become insanely hard; this game is way too difficult for people under age 13. Overall, it's a decent game and lets you have fun with several of your friends. Just a quick FYI- the game says there's a cheat code for unlimited lives, but there actually isn't. The programmers forgot to put it in."
5,"Hunter, a good role playing game a good video game","Hunter is an excellent Role Playing based game it is based upon the original Hunter The Reckoning first done by White Wolf. In its gaming time it has lost all but 4 of the original 9 character types, but that doesn't make the game any worse. As solo this game can be challenging and on Multiplayer quite a fun time. It is much like the Gauntlet Legends of today. For such a low price it is a good deal. In stores though it can be hard to find. Going around and killing thousands of zombies is the basic plot of it all. Along the way you meet up with a vampire who insists upon being called Carpenter who reveals the reason the dead have risen again. This game is a little lacking in the story compared to the original but with all the action going on its OK. Overall I loved this game and think that if you are into things like Resident Evil and Gauntlet Legends then you should at least try this game"
3,Average Game,"I got this game with all of my b-day money. It was pretty dumb of me though. Here is my review.Graphics:Nothing great, but not the worst either. 3 out of 5.Gameplay:Not too great either. You run around with the control stick and push R to shoot and aim with c-stick and push L to jump. Half of the time, when you are trying to shoot zombies or whatever creature is after you, your character will not aim at them. 3 out of 5.Sound:Pretty average. 3 out of 5.All in all, I wouldn't buy this game if I could go back in time. It is like Gauntlet, with better graphics and sound. I found this game very hard though. If you're looking for a fun game, get Cel Damage."
2,Not the best game out there,"I baught this game. Its bad. the graphics [not good]. They remind me of an n64 game with bad graphics. and the game play is very repetetive. I got bored after 5 minutes. its like a bad version of gauntlet legends, but in a more modern time. If youre even thinking of getting it, rent it first. get gauntlet legends."
5,And what a great journey it is,"This is yet another outstanding CD by the great Rosemary Clooney! Her voice, smooth as silk, takes us on a journey back in time to the world of big bands and girl singers. Among the best tracks on this collection are AND THE ANGELS SING, HAPPINESS IS JUST A THING CALLED JOE, and, of course, the title track. Her talent is amazing and I certainly miss her!This is a must for any Rosemary Clooney fan!"
5,Talk about a velvet voice ...,"Listened to this CD and absolutely enjoyed it. Almost felt as if I were sitting at a table in some nightclub, watching her as well. Well done!"
5,A Must Have for Any Kitchen,"I have two Nesco Roasters, a 6 QT and an 18 QT. I don't know how I survived without them. Better than a crock pot. Unlike most crock pots Nesco's have metal inserts not glass. They clean in a breeze and the temp setting allows for not only slow cooking but roasting, steaming and baking. I have yet to make a bad meal and the slow cook feature is great for working people. Put it on in the morning and dinner is ready when you come home. Also, you can get great recepies off the Nesco web site. Buy one, you won't be sorry."
5,Smooth sale,The product received is what I expected. The price I paid was less then retail. And we are using it/enjoying it everyday without any problems.
1,Stay away from Dell,"2 year old Dell 8400, ...paid top dollars, ... nothing but trouble, ..now I can not get the thing to work, ... Did everything Tech support asked me to do, ..nothing. I get that solid amber light on the power button, and I am not sure if mobo is out or cpu is out. Try to get tech people to help is almost impossible, ..that's if you can get anyone to talk to you first. It is frustrating as this was my first Dell, and my previous computers were never a problem. I know Dell people know about this problem as I see lot of people with similar prolbem trying to fix their Dell without much success (sometimes cpu, sometimes mobo). They keep this up, they will lose customers and become like Tandy, Commadore or one of those, .... I am not a happy customer Dell!"
1,Awful Performance + Terrible Service,I bought a Dell dimension about 2 years ago. When I purchased they mentioned that it included a 3 year ON-SITE service. The computer has become ridiculously slow and when I have called for support the representatives have made me run tons of diagnostic tests which show nothing abnormal. When I mentioned the ON-SITE service they send me an e-mail with a long legal document which contains my coverage and they will not give me additional support. I would recommend potential buyers to avoid this product.
1,BUYER BEWARE - DELL IS TERRIBLE,"I purchased my Dell 3 yrs. ago. From the beginning I have received ill treatment from the Dell staff, plus the computer is a big piece of excrement. The salesman hooked me in by stating that they honored a 6 month same as cash purchase, when actually it was a 3 MONTH SAME AS CASH! I, too, like others on this post went all the way to the top to Michael Dell. He never responded to me either. Not even an acknowledgement. Once they have your money you're screwed. (Guess that's how they make their money.) I spent almost $3,000 on this computer (specifically for the graphics) - it can't even play a complete Half-Life game without freezing up. The CD/DVD-R had to be replaced because IT NEVER WORKED! People, if you take heed to any advice please listen to what we tell you here and STAY AWAY FROM DELL!!!!!!!"
1,"Well, don't buy a dell","When the Dell was working, it was great. It worked good and everything. Three years after I bought the Dell, it was harder to start up and turn on the computer. Soon, it wouldn't work at all and made a weird clicking noise. In conclusion, I don't recommend it. My Hp has worked for 9 years, and I'm typing on it right now."
1,No good,"This is the same PC I have. It's not too great. Most of my things don't work. The description says 160GB hard drive, but most of that is system files and fragments. My computer now has only 6GB of space! I'm constantly getting viruses when I go on the internet too. Whenever I delete something, I always find fragments of it and copies in random folders. I seriously suggest a Macintosh."
2,oh man... (in stressed kinda way),"The thing is too expensive, the parts are crap, and it can't play games that are too advanced for it(Doom 3, Far Cry, Half-Life 2, any other 2004-2005 games). It's the computer that I'm using right now, which sucks."
1,NOOOO,Dells are pieces of horse droppings fused together with odds and ends jumbled up inside. They're horrific computers and the hideously awful Windows XP makes them crash 24/7.
5,Unique amoung chess books,"This book delivers as the title says. Discussed are Fischer's decisions across various motifs (pawn structure, piece placement, strategy,...) from a diagrammed position. Much of the book can be read without a board depending on your strength. I think this book is more for advanced players, you just need to know things to get the most out of this book. Really the book is about style -- the style of a genius, so no chess player should be without it."
3,"Well, the UFC does produce duds sometimes","The other reviewers did a GREAT job already at reviewing this so I just have to back them up. I really liked the fight between the jujitsu champ and the judo guy. They don't know how to punch but it is still fun to watch and learn these guys cyrstal clear techniques in the style they use.The main match is just horribble. It would have been OK because the main event rarely lives up to expectations but only half of the fights are watchable on this card. I have seen Dennis Hallman too many times and it is amazing that he is still the exact same person. He comes out tough in the first part of the first round, then later in the round dies out, gets punched over an over and then finally in the 3rd round he gives it one last burst. I just don't know how the guy does it. Definitely one of the toughest S.O.B.'s ever that would benifit greatly from better training.So there about 50 UFC's better than this one, be sure to check them out first."
1,Worst UFC event in years,"As a fan of all MMA and a huge UFC fan, I just want everyone to know that this is the worst UFC in recent memory. If you're looking into your first MMA event, pass on this one (instead, grab the Pride Shockwave event that's being released around the same time).Horrible match-ups, horrible fights. UFC usually produces great events even in the absence of a star-studded card (like most Pride events), but this is an exception. F-"
2,One of the worst UFCs,"Arlovski's match against Buentello was terribly short. Sakara's match provided an anticlimactic finish. Griffin's match against Sinosic was a short stand-up boxing match, which was boring. Both Jorge Rivera and Dennis Hallman were exhausted and lacked the decisiveness and sting required to finish the match. The only silver lining was the grudge match between Sobral and Chael Sonnen."
5,This Pay Per View Is Great,This Card Was Great The Main Event Was Andrei Arlovski Vs Paul Buentello This Match Lasted Just A Couple Of Seconds But The Knockout Was Great Also Forrest Griffin Fought Elvis On This Card Also On This Card Andrei Arlovski Became The Offical UFC World Heavyweight Champion
1,Not that great.,"This album by John Cain is inferior to his previous releases with Journey and Bad English. Musically this is a good CD, but the songwriting is all-in-all unfocused. The only exeption to this rule is the song ""I Wish I Was There With You"" which is esentially a throwaway track from the last Bad English album which makes the song way better than the rest of them."
5,DeWohl's finest?,"Of the six or seven DeWohl books I've read, I think 'Set All Afire' is the most enduring. In it, DeWohl employs his usual style of 'historical fiction' where he weaves fictional dialogue and details into the factual framework of St. Francis Xavier's life.And this is no ordinary life. St. Francis was a brilliant european university student who bumped into St. Ignatius. His subsequent conversion and missionary journey to the far east is the stuff of legends. Under constant threat, he converted entire islands to Christianity and penetrated walls no westerner had ever crossed.DeWohl captures the essence of Xavier so effectively that it feels as though you know the saint personally. And the story is written in such an engrossing manner that you lose yourself in the journey. The pages begin to blur into each other and the twists and turns become alternately joyous and haunting. When is the last time you burned the midnight oil to read about a saint?Highly Recommended without reservation."
5,Excellent Book,"I can't stress enough, if you are an NP or faculty, this is a great book to use in practice or to have as a reference.Excellent Book!!"
5,I love this book,This book was recommended to me by my preceptor during clinical and It has helped me so much! I wish I would have got it earlier in my education.
4,Clinical Guidelines in Family Practice,This is an excellent clinical resource. Assessment and treatment guidelines are easy to use and easy to understand.
2,Clinical Guidelines in Family Practice,I am looking forward to the new edition of Uphold & Graham (2003) this book does not provide enough detail for clinical practice guidelines.
5,Great book but we need an updated version,"I LOVE this book, I purchased it back in 2003 when I was a new graduate and it was the most used book that I owned. I still have it and it is still somewhat useful but needs to be updated. Pleaseeee put out a new edition. I will be the first in line to buy it."
5,Priceless!,"This book is an amazing accomplishment by the author(s). As an FNP student is was my most valuable asset, and will remain in my office after I (hopefully) pass my board exam. Recommended to me by an instructor, it is great for learning what to look for in examining the pt as well as writing good soap notes. The publication date is 2003 though, I hope they publish a more recent version in the very near future, however, the fundamentals offered within this book are priceless and it is a purchase you will not regret!"
5,Clinical Guidelines in Family Practice,The book came in a timely fashion and was in excellent condition.
5,Invaluable resource!,This book is an invaluable resource even if it is six years old. The basics of diagnosis never really change--and updates in treatment are easy to find. Worth every penny!
5,FNP Guidelines,"This is a remarkable book that gives the FNP, whether novice or expert, the continuity that is needed for the profession. I hope this will be updated soon. I don't want to buy another one until then but mine is getting pretty dog eared!"
5,Great Resource Book,"I used this book in graduate school and purchased as an update. This book is a great resource book, is easy to use."
5,"Excellent Backpack, esp. for younger players...","I have two of these BPs for U13-U11 players. They are PERFECT for them, but the size may be a bit too small for older kids with size 5 ball and more ""stuff"" to haul around. Adequately handles ball, towel, change of clothes and glasses, and shoes/guards.Kevin"
5,Soccer Lover,"Love this soccer bag! Have had it for over a year, it stands up great to soccer boys. Expect to have it for many more. Great pockets, made with the soccer player in mind."
4,Nice blues oriented set,"Dan Toler and his brother Dave have been in the Allman Brothers Band and the solo bands of both Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts. For this, their first release on their own, they've chosen a very bluesy style with vocals from other band members. The playing is very strong and the overall quality of the CD is a lot better than some might think. At about 35 minutes, the length is a little skimpy but what's there is pretty good."
5,Real Roadhouse Rock and Blues,"If you enjoy flat out Roadhouse Rock and Blues this disc is for you.Dangerous Dan Toler is a most amazing guitarist. His brother Fankie lays down the road and the band follows it with one great song after another. If ya like Rockin/Blues music, this disc is a must for your collection. How did Dickey Betts and Gregg Allman get so lucky to play with this guy..??DDT Rocks.."
3,Why don't they just say it's from China?,"I just wanted to comment that ""Inner Mongolia"" is just a province in China. Inner Mongolia does sound more exotic, but it's still just China. Just say it's from China! The material is not that great."
5,Love it!,"The sweater is fabulous. I was little worried about it being cashmere and too delicate, but I've already washed it (delicate cycle and hang dry) once and it turned out just the same as when I bought it. It's soft, cozy and warm. And very cute!"
3,Great Buy,"I purchased 1 red & 1 teal at a higher price. The colors are vibrant. The weight is perfect. As anyone knows you always buy a size bigger in cashmere. I have received many compliments. I am buying more, this price is great."
5,great,The only swing my daughter would nap in...I bought it online for $99 with free shipping! Target has it for $140...definitely an awesome buy!
5,Excellent swing!!!,"I have just become a mom for the third time. My kids span seven years, and I have tried all the swings and products. This purchase was a must have, and I carefully spoke with many people who had purchased similar products, and this won hands down. The best part of this swing other than the fact that the swing swivels to rock different directions, is the fact that it comes with a volume control!!!! I don't know why toy manufacturers feel the need to blast children's ears with loud music, but this lets you control the volume. I have been nothing but happy with this swing, as has my son. He likes the babbling brook and the cricket sounds that the swing makes. If you are in doubt or trying to decide which swing is for you, I would consider this one. It has been well worth the money!!!"
3,To fast for an infant,We have purchased many swings and each one has its own issues. Our newborn likes this swing and is amazed with the toys but the speed of the swing is way to fast and actually causes the baby to almost vomit. We have decided to swing it for a while and wear down the batteries and it works fine. Or just sit and swing the child in the swing manually pushing it every couple of minutes.
3,"Nice swing, BUT...",... even the slowest rocking speed was too fast for my son. Otherwise the product is fine.
5,What a lifesaver!,"I have two of these. My five month old twins love them. It allowed me to be able to put down my daughter with acid reflux for a few minutes, so I could feed her sister. I love the neutral colors because the swings are in our living room, since we have a small house. All of features are useful and enjoyed by our daughters on a daily basis."
2,"I Love the cradle swing, however.......","The option of the swing being able to swing in both directions is wonderful, however my son unfortunately would scream when I put him in the papasan chair! I went out and got the ocean wonders cradle swing and he loves it! I think the fabric on the papasan chair would get too warm and he would get fussy almost within a few minutes everytime! The headrest wasn't all that comfortable for him either, it would bend his ears forward and he and I hated that!"
1,Great swing with one BIG problem!,"We got this swing for my wifes shower and really love it, except for one BIG thing. We put the baby in the swing and turnrd it on and it rocks fine for about 20 seconds, (another customer had the same exact complaint) then it really starts to move faster and faster jumping off of one leg. I'm not sure if this is a defective swing or are they all like this.For this reason I am giving it 1*otherwise it would get 5*s."
5,A Livesaver!,"For the first 4 months this swing was where our baby napped best. It was quiet and smooth, and she would just be lulled right to sleep. We also dealt with gas issues early on, and she was more comfortable in the swing than flat on her back when she was gassy. She was also a big fan of the overhead mirror and spinning animals. This was my first experience with a baby swing, but I would definitely use this model again."
5,"FINALLY, YOU PAY MORE YOU GET MORE!","This swing is the absolute best! Hands down. Loved the swing when I saw it, and purchsed it. Loved it even more when I would watch my little girl watch the birds go around above her and she would fall asleep. Nothing better than having your baby be calm and content with their surroundings. I wanted the papasan bouncer also, though the more I looked into it....it doesn't bounce! It's not like the other bouncers. The swing though is the best by far."
5,Great swing,My husband and I love this swing. But I can't see anyone keeping a baby in it until they are two years. My baby just turned 4 months I think she'll fit in it another 2 months at top. At 4 months her weight makes the swing move very slow even at the fastest speed. She weighs about 16 pounds now. I cringe at the thought of her out growing this swing. Some nights she can't sleep in her crib and I've kept her in the swing all night. It is like a little cradle that swings so she is safe and comfortable... even for hours. If you buy this use stock up on batteries. Right now we are going through four DD every 5 or 6 days.
4,My little girl loves it,"My daughter is 5 weeks old and loves this swing. She loves staring up at herself in the mirror. The music settings are nice and soothing. She has no problem putting herself to sleep in it. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that, I wish the birds and butterfly would face down so she could see them. I don't need to be able to see them and that's what they do is face out. I highly recommend this swing."
2,Its an ok swing,I received this swing after I had my baby I thought I needed a $130 swing. Its ALRIGHT it runs out of batteries fast and when your baby starts getting to big for it it doesn't swing as well as it should and sometimes it get very squeaky. Also the toys aren't very fun
3,It works well enough.,Our 7 week old naps longer in this swing using the front to back motion. Three times we've used the side to side motion and she's vomited. My chief complaint is that the lowest speed is MUCH to fast. Not much difference between speeds 1 and 6. So you're paying more money for more speeds but in reality there's only speeds fast and faster. The colors are bland but I like that it doesn't look outrageous like most kids stuff. The mirror is a nice touch except in order to use it she has to crane her head to see herself. The construction seems solid but after a few days of use I have to make sure the legs are extended to the fullest because the legs move inward with every use. Not really worth the money but I'm too lazy to pack it up and return it. I should have bought a cheaper swing to try out first instead of going straight for the most expensive.
5,Wonderful,Our baby is a newborn and we are already getting use out of this swing. We put her in it and she loves it. It rocks her to sleep. She also enjoys watching the mobile. It gives me a chance to clean up or eat something :) I am sure we will use it plenty in the months to come.
2,Temporarily Decent,"The swing is great - if you only plan on using it for one child. It worked really well for our first and was considered a lifesaver at many points. After he outgrew it, the swing was put in our storage room for about a year. When we got it out for a second child, it was a let down. The ""mobile"" part of the swing works fine, as well as the music. It does not, however, actually swing. Isn't that the reason you buy a swing? I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone planning on using it for multiple children."
2,"Helpful item, no so helpful company","Our son loved this swing initially-it was our last ditch effort to get him to sleep when he just can't be calmed down. Unfortunately, the mobile went out 2 weeks ago and the speed of the swing has slowed more everyday. I contacted Fischer Price 2 weeks ago and was told another motor would arrive in 10-14 days. Long story short, I have been told 3 different things by the company and have no hopes of a replacement motor within the next 2 weeks - more than a month later is terrible customer service - especially when babies change so quickly.I'm going to have to buy a new swing all together. Fisher Price treats their customers poorly!"
4,Pretty good,"Kinda loud...but my daughter didn't seem to mind. Great deal if you can get it on sale and it's an older design. FYI, it doesn't plug in. But did save many nights. A swing is a must have for most babies."
3,Must Read,"When I first saw this swing I fell in love with it. I love the neutral color and I love that it swings both ways. Just beware the motor makes a funny noise. When I put batteries in it I thought it was broke but, I see other people have the same complaint. It almost sounds like a dying motor. If you turn the music on you can't here the weird noise as much."
2,Not safe for big babies,"My friend loved the swing until her baby got a little bigger. At 5 months old he wasn't able to stay in it anymore. With the swing speed as fast as it was, the baby would tend to fall to the side almost hitting his head on the side, she would have to constantly prop him back up so he wouldn't fall out. The shape was comfy for baby but didn't give much support to hold him in. The Graco swing I bought had enough support and restraint to keep baby in. Great look but not safe!"
2,Moves way too fast!!,We bought this swing because it looked so comfy and because it swings side to side and front to back. The first time we put her in it (newborn) she was swinging way too fast. The legs came off the floor and there is no way to adjust it to go slower. We tried to put the blanket in it to slow down the swing but she kicked it off. Other placements of blanket didn't work as well. She is now 4 months old and I have just started using it and I am still worried about her in there because the legs still come off the floor. I cannot let it out of sight while my daughter is in there. Since she now weighs over 15 lbs I don't think it should still be going this fast. We called Fisher-Price and they said 1/2 inch off the floor is acceptable but I don't think it is when both legs are coming up. It looks great but I don't feel it is safe and it swings too fast for comfort. We talked to Fisher Price and they will take it back for a full refund.
1,fire hazard!,"I never write reviews, but felt this important to share! My daughter and I loved this swing until this week, when it started smoking and producing a burning smell. It smelled like the motor caught on fire - which is scarey because my baby is in it alot!! I looked at other web sites with consumer reviews and found that other parents have had similar issues!! Please look into this before you buy."
1,Set fire!!!!!,"At first this swing was awesome, we loved the look and the feel. Just the other day it started acting funny, everytime I would shut it off, the music would turn on? Not sure if that is normal. Then just today I had my 6 month old daughter who is only 13lbs in the swing when I started to smell something funny. Then I realized the swing started smoking, so I imediately took her out of the swing and threw it ousde when the dial part went up in flames! So anyone who has or wants this swing becareful!!"
2,I loved this at first,This was the best swing. Our baby would nap in it for hours since sleeping in the crib was out! And it was our go to at night when our baby just wouldn't have anything to do with his crib. But after 3 months the swing part stopped working! The mobile works fine but the swing doesn't work at all. We still use it a lot just without the swinging motion. I've looked in to getting this fixed but I would have to ship the swing to New York and I'm here in California at my own expense and they would fix it and send me a new one. To me it just isn't worth the hassle to sending it out cause by the time I would get it back I'm sure my little guy would be to heavy to use it anyway.
5,Great Baby Swing,"My 6 week old daughter absolutely loves this swing. We use the side-to-side cradle setting. Other than being rocked by Mom or Dad, this is the next best thing. We've had the swing for a month, using it for several hours a day (our daughter naps in it) and we are still on the original set of D batteries.The mobile and mirror are an added bonus- our daughter is doubly amused by them.I would recomend this swing to any parent!"
3,Noisey!,"I haven't had my baby yet, but we have had to return this swing once already because the one we had, had such a loud motor! The second one we bought had the same problem! Babies R Us said it was hit and miss with this brand and some are fine and others are obnoxiously loud. We are now returning it again and hope that the third one is the the charm. I think that is a very big flaw to have in just ""some"". Very disapointed, and tired of packing and unpacking the same thing over and over and multiple trips to the store!"
4,"Great swing, one minor drawback","I of course fell in love with this swing the moment I saw it. It looked so soft and comfy for my new one on the way. I just delivered a preemie baby however and my only complaint is that it swings too fast even on the lowest setting. I have to keep slowing it down. Not sure if this is related to her size or not, <5lbs., but defnitley something to keep an eye on. Otherwise she loves the swing, the music sounds are great!"
2,Not worth the money,"We have this for our son who is 10 weeks old and every time we put him in it his head seems to flop either to the side or front! Also I think it goes a bit to fast for a baby and one leg seems to lift slightly while swinging. Another thing is the mobile part, It's very cute but also very difficult for a child to try and hold their head back enough to even see it."
4,Baby will love it.,This swing is awesome. Babies will love to see the mirror and the little figures that go around and around. The only problem is that lighter babies cause the motor in the swing to go way too fast. Beware if you have a lighter baby and are using the motor swing because it swings the baby really fast. Just manually swing it and you'll be fine. Great product though.
4,Almost perfect,"My husband and I returned the Aquarium swing due to motor malfunctions and decided to upgrade to this one.Our daughter loves it!The papasan is comfortable for her,there are 2 sitting positions,and different sound settings.As far as another person's complaint about the birds hitting the bar,we were watching the swing the other night and noticed how they seemed to pause to miss the bar,so you had a faulty swing and could have returned it for the same model if you liked it,aside from that problem.The only complaint I have is from her angle,she can only see the bottom of the birds and butterfly as they move around.They should be positioned differently so she can see them completely.She LOVES the mirror and coos and squeals at it for hours on end!Worth the money!"
5,A mother's best friend!,This swing is the best and worth every penny! My daughter is 2 months old and she LOVES it and enjoys staring at the little birds and mirror while she swings. She naps for hours at a time in this so I can get LOTS of work done. The cushion is so soft and extremely easy to wash. It holds up very well in both the washer and dryer. We've used this swing a few hours every day for 9 weeks and just now put in the second set of batteries. This is a MUST HAVE!
5,She loves it!!,"This swing has been an absolute blessing! My daughter has been using it since she was born. She's now 4 1/2 months, and the swing is her favorite place. I know she'll sleep there if nowhere else!"
5,Best Swing Ever!,"This is the best swing I have ever seen or used! My daughter loves it! My only wish is that it A) has an AC adapter so you don't go thru so many batteries, and B)the pillow was detachable for easy cleaning (seems the pillow gets the drool and ick faster than the seat part). Other than that this is a great swing..highly recommend"
5,a must for some babies,"this product saved us a lot of grief. baby would not nap without it for the first couple months. Battery life is decent, but wish they had a AC plug in model. also the music shut off every 7 minutes, should play for longer. The legs started bending a little too, towards the end, but over very happy we got it. you won't regret it either if you baby has some trouble sleeping."
4,Great for fussy babies!,"My daughter pretty much lives in her swing.. the toys are kinda boring but she never really plays with toys anyway (she's only 4 months) she would rather ""ppl watch"" when she gets fussy I jsut move the direction of the swinging and make it could front to back and she's fine.. The only suggestion I have is get TWO sets of rechargable batteries so you will always have some on hand in those crutial moments"
3,Great swing but burns through batteries!!,"This is a great swing, but with a few flaws. Firstly, it BURNS through batteries. I'm on my 4th set in 2 months. And they are the expensive large batteries.Secondly, I wish there was more song selection. The songs are now driving me insane.Lastly, my son always falls down in the headpiece and his neck ends up all crooked. I wish the head piece was more stable. I'm scared he'll develop tortecollis from this position so I limit his time in here.It is great though as an easy way to get him to sleep so I can do some chores. I know he'll stay in here for a good hour and nap."
2,Started to squeak when baby hit 10 lbs.,"This swing was a life saver when we brought baby home, that is until he got a little bigger. Once he weighed about 10 pounds, it started to constantly squeak. We took it back to the store and they gave us a new one. Once home we put him in it and it squeaked immediately. The squeaking would wake him up...defeating the purpose of the swing. Moreover, the seat on the second one I put together was tilted - as was the model on display in the store...perhaps poor manufacturing standards? I took it back and picked up the Sweet Peace by Graco - I'm happy thus far. I would not recommend the Papasan swing."
4,Worth the money,"It is expensive but it is worth the money. You can put your baby in it from birth and it seems very comfortable. My daughter has enjoyed it through many stages. At birth, it was the only the thing that my husband & I could do to give her space and relax her when she was fussy. Then, she noticed the mobile at 5 weeks, which entertained her for weeks.The only complaints are the price and when the baby is an infant, even the slowest speed is fast for an infant. We would have to push it by hand every so often to give the swing a slower pace."
3,"Good swing, but MAJOR drawbacks","I love the look and versatility of this swing, BUT, no AC power adaptor sucks! It's not a portable swing, so it should have AC power option. We purchased rechargable batteries, thank goodness, but it's still a pain to change the batteries in and out every few days. Rechargable battiers are a MUST for you to purchase if you get this swing.Also, this swing is loud and rocks really fast. Our newborn has to be swaddled with multiple blankets so he fits, and even on the slowest setting, I think it's too fast for him.My son seems to like it though, so I've gave it a 3 star even though I would have gotten a cheaper one (with the same beautiful neutral look) if I would have known."
3,Get a Charger!,"My son is two months old and loves his swing! He will sit in it forever looking up at himself in the mirror, smiling and laughing, it's cute. HOWEVER, we have been going thru four D batteries every week, that's $20 a week which adds up. We were not able to find a charger for D's either. I think Office Depot has one and it's pretty cheap about $30? Anyway make sure you get a charger before you have your baby because after he/she is born searching for a battery charger is the last thing you want to do."
5,"A Really Great Swing, Well Worth the Price!","When I was registering for gifts, I saw this swing and fell in love with it even though I was a bit hesitant about the cost - it is definitely on the higher end of the price category. My daughter has loved it from the start. First she really liked the side-to-side motion and was lulled to sleep almost immediately after we strapped her in. Now that she's four months old, she prefers the front-to-back motion and is either entertained enough to stay quiet or, if she's tired, she quickly drifts off while watching the mobile and listening to music or nature sounds. She even naps in it for several hours at a time. I highly recommend this item!"
1,Same problems after two purchases,"Like many other users I wanted to say that this swing has problems. We brought our first one home to find after two days of use (3 hours or less total) the sound started to distort, the swing would stop swinging and the mobile stopped spinning altogether. We took it back for a replacement. The next one worked for about one month before the functions began to slow down. We changed the batteries and found the same problems with the sound distorting and the swing slowing down. We changed the batteries again. Now the swing works, but nothing else does. I would like to say our baby absolutely loved it - especially the mirror, so that was great. I usually don't leave bad reviews, but with 500+ other reviews saying how fabulous this product was, I felt it was important to include my experience. For reference our baby is 11 weeks and 12 pounds."
1,Barely Moves Anymore...,"My three month old enjoyed being in this swing. She is only 12.5 pounds and the swing barely moves now. I've tried putting in new and different batteries and it doesn't make a difference. When I take her out of it the swing moves fine but when she is in it, it moves really slow. I say this thing is a lemon. In order to get it fixed, I have to box it up and ship it out. Not worth the hassle in my opinion. I am in the market for another one."
3,Lauraubie,"I have had this swing since my little one was born. She is 7 months now. The only problem I have with it is that the manual says that it can be used up to 24 pounds. Which to me seemed like I could get good long term use out of it. At 7 months, and only 14 pounds I have to discontinue use. Since the seat does not have a 5 point harness and a floppy seatbelt my sweet baby girl can wiggle her way out. She was peacefully sleeping the other day for me to leave the room and return to find her upside down hanging on by just a bit of the fastened seatbelt. Yes, she was still asleep.She loves her swing and since the fisher price corporation didn't install a 5 point harness she has outgrown it sooner than I know she would have liked."
2,Could be better,"My son loves this swing. I did too, until it stopped swinging. I changed the batteries thinking that was the problem. I took my son out of the swing and turned it on and it worked fine. So I took it back to the store and got another one. Now, it is doing the same thing. My son is 15lbs. The swing says it holds 25lbs. I plan on calling the manufactuer. I wish it worked properly!!!Before it stopped swinging it was a great swing. I love that it can cradle him or swing him."
1,Look Somewhere Else for a Swing!!!,"I bought this swing when we first found out we were pregnant with our second child. We ended up assembling it about two weeks before my daughter was born. After just one use as a newborn the motor housing unit died. The mobile stopped working, yet the swing would keep swinging. I contacted Fisher Price, who I must say were pretty amazing, and they sent me another replacement unit for free. I replaced the unit, bought brand new D batteries and we tried again. This time the swing worked for about one week then it died. I figured it had to be the batteries; there was no way this same thing would happen again right, wrong. After several different brands of D batteries (which by the way aren't cheap), hours of frustration, and 3, count them 3 motor replacement parts the swing still isn't working. I am soooo frustrated and angry I wasted over $150 for this piece of junk! Learn from my mistake and look elsewhere for a baby swing!"
4,Best Swing Available,"It is definitely the best swing on the market with all of its bells and whistles, stability, versatility, and even looks. I have had lots of people comment on just how comfortable it looks. The dual swing action is nice but, my boy only seems to like swinging side to side so, we never really used the front to back motion. Now, that he is six months he doesn't really seem to like swinging at all. He does like to just chill out in it especially later in the evening as it gets closer to his bedtime.As others have mentioned it does swing very fast even on the lowest setting. We still have not gone past first gear. The weight of the child will dictate how fast it swings. We threaded a towel between the cushion and seat support and let it drag on the floor for the first 4 months to slow it down."
5,Perfect Infant Swing,"I would give it a score above 5, if possible. My twins spend most of their infancy in this. We used it as their nap spot (downstairs) for about the first six months. After that they still loved to play in it, until they were too big. They were upset to lose it. I recommend it to any new mom. My life saver for the first few months, especially with 2 swings for TWINS. I was able to go the room next door within my open house, and they were not only safe, they LOVED IT and I was able to get things done!"
5,very pleased mom,"This is the best swing out there. We originally had a graco swing that a friend gave us, but my son hated it. Our sitter has one of these papasan swings and had put our son in it, she said he loved it and fell asleep in it. After that I had to invest in one, its the best investment yet for our baby. When he is fussy because he is tired, we just put him in the swing and out he goes. He also really enjoys watching the mobile. It would be better if it had an ac adapter, but we have only replaced the batteries once in the month since we got it. Not only that but the batteries we originally put in it had already been used, so I think they actually would last a lot longer. All in all an excellent swing."
1,Motor Burn out,"We loved this swing for the first 1 month, it was quiet and our daughter loved it. After that first month it started to click and get louder. We called the manufacturer and we were told that happens. After 3 months 4 of the 6 speeds did not work anymore. So now I am stuck with a swing with speed 1 and 6 available and no motor parts in sight. This has been discontinued and the warrenty is spotty at best. We have another child coming and now have to buy a new swing .. definiatly not this one."
4,Good swing,"Our baby has been enjoying it and fell asleep in it quite a few times when she was sleepy. The adjustable speed comes out handy. We would use the highest level to get the swing in motion as soon as possible in a few seconds, and go back to the lowest to get the speed we ususally use for our baby. I only wish there could be more choices for music. Also, the safety belt is too short maybe because ours is a big baby; we were only able to buckle one of her legs which made us a little nervous. Anyway, we have been satisfied with this swing."
5,Couldn't have made it through the first 12 weeks without it!,"Swing is fantastic. Holds up well wash after wash. My daughter was very colicky her first twelve weeks. The only sleep my husband and I managed to get was when she was in this swing. The sounds are great (although I can hear them all day in my head now!), the seat is cushy and the neck rest is great for the tiny ones. Although the auto swing motion is a bit fast, even on the lowest setting, until baby is about 12 lbs. We just manually swung her in it. My daughter is almost 6 months old and still loves to swing in her papasan. This was truly the best gift we received! My husband and I want to develop one of these for adults. I know I'd use it all the time!"
5,"Easy Set Up, Beautiful item","I just love this cradle swing. Nice product for the money. Easy to setup, cute songs and birds. No ""loud"" colors, just a sweet neutral look. Highly recommended."
5,Had to have it,"Because we have a small house, we bought the ocean wonders travel swing instead of a big stationary swing. When we tried the travel swing, our daughter wouldn't stay in it for more than a few minutes before she was crying and fussing to get out. So, when we visited a friend who had this baby papasan swing and she calmly sat in it for at least 45 minutes...we were amazed. On top of that, while she usually fights sleep, she quietly fell asleep while swinging and listening to the bird sounds. We were so thrilled we bought this swing for our house the very next weekend! While it does take up a bit of space, it's worth it to hear the contented ""coos"" of approval."
4,A great swing...only the Aquarium Swing is better IMO,"I actually have both the Aquarium Swing and the Papasan swing. We recieved the AS as a gift along w/ the Baby Papasan (non-swing). Having a colicky and reflux baby, we relied on these two items for the first weeks of his life. We recently received the Papasan swing as a gift and so we can keep one on the second floor and one in his nursery.My main gripe (aside from the comments already addressed such as lack of padding and slight noise) is that the pillow is adjustable but not removable. I wanted to use a Boppy Noggin Nest (see the Pottery Barn Kids version) but couldn't unless I cut the attached pillow off. I was fine w/ that since my husband had already wired an A/C adapter into the Papasan swing anyway.So parents, if you're relying on this swing to get you through colicky periods and want to avoid plagio issues, cut off the pillow and replace w/ an approved ""noggin nest."" Otherwise, the pillow should be just fine."
5,*Love It *Love It *Love It,My sons loves this swing! It is such a lifesaver if he is fussy he goes in his swing and stares at himself in the mirror on the bottom of the mobil and smiles. The music and sounds are great and you have control over how loud the sounds are. It is such a comfortable looking seat and my baby seems to think so too because he drifts off to sleep not too long after he goes in it. I love it. Its worth the little extra it costs for what you are getting.
1,Defective Cradle Swing,In 7 weeks I've gone through 3 sets of batteries to find that the musical portion of the swing does not work. The music is distorted and the swinging makes an obnoxious clicking sound. The leaves barely move. Only one birds moves enough to grab my baby's attention.
1,Our baby didn't feel secure in this swing,"We actually traded swings with a friend who had the more traditional swing - our baby would not relax in the Papasan. When he was in the regular swings at his daycare, he'd snooze right away. After we switched swings, he loved his new one. He was a pretty big baby, and I think he just couldn't snuggle down since the indention is pretty shallow."
5,heavenly!,"My 3 month old daughter hasn't gotten along with her bouncy seat, so we tried this swing after reading the reviews. At first I thought it was pretty expensive, but after my daughter fell asleep in it for over and hour and a half, My Mother said it was UNDERPRICED! MY BABY LOVES IT! She is mesmerized by the bird/butterfly mobile that spins above and loves to look at herself in the mirror and smile. (Girl after my own heart!) After a while of amusement, she will inevitably go to sleep. A friend calls it the ""neglectomatic"" but I think it's a wonderful thing to have as long as you don't leave your baby in it all day long! Downfalls for me are it is slightly too big for the space we live in and it is kind of a pain that you have to keep resetting the sounds after 5 mins or so, but at least that prevents you from going down to the store! I highly recommend this."
5,A Lifesaver for a New Parent!,"This has been a lifesaver for the first 9 months of our sons life. This has been extremely effective at naptime and also has been great as a great alternative to his crib on 2 occasions when he had a headcold and needed to sleep on a bit of an angle @ nightime.We get many compliments on the swing and have since given several as baby shower gifts to friends. Also, it is fairly easy to move around the house when needed.Only downside is unless you are conservative on the many bells & whistles/features on the swing, you may go through batteries fairly fast.We have also had great results with the Deluxe Jumperoo by Fisher Price."
4,Great for newborns,I had a hard time deciding between this swing and the oceans wonder aquarium swing. I was concerned at how much more expensive this swing was compared to the other swing. I choose to register for this swing because 1) it looked more pleasing than the other swing in my family room and 2) many people said that it was a quietest out of all the swings.I feel like I am getting my money's worth because my 7 week old son loves his swing. He loves the mobile and he easily spends 1 hour or more happily swinging away. My only complaint which other people have mentioned as well is that even on the slowest setting it is a little too fast for a baby under 1 month old.
3,not worth $130,"i bought this swing for my 2nd child with the intention of replacing the Graco 2 speed open top swing I had for my 1st child. I was enticed to buy this swing because of the 6 speeds, 2 way swing option, neutral colors, and mainly because it looks so comfortable for newborns. After using it for a couple of months I have come to regret my purchase, and am now wondering why i replaced a swing that worked just fine. i have not found the need for the additional speeds, the mobile/toys are not stimulating, the nature sounds are annoying. I do like that the swing goes 2 different ways, and that my newborn fit nicely into it without having to put a bunch of blankets around him so he was not flopping over. but i had to ask myself, are these two good features worth the extra money? no, not in my opinion. my graco 2 speed did not have all the bells and whistles, but i have discovered they are not at all neccessary."
2,Way to fast of a swing for us ( Scott B. Naperville IL ),My wife and I bought this swing cause it was just so nice.... liked that it swings both side to side and back and forth... when we but our son in the thing on the first speed ( slow ) it was going back and forth real nice.... then about 30 sec later it just got going faster and faster.... I don't know about you but im not going to but my new born child in a swing that swings like that..... so I took him out and and tried the fast speed.... it was the same speed.... so we have been putting him in it with out turning it on and just use the other thing that turn.... ( thats really cool ) but reading some of the other reviews maybe I got a bad one there are only a couple of other people that said theres are too fast also.... and ever one else loves there's...... but I didn't pay 119.00 bucks to have him just sit in it with out swinging.... I hope there are other people out there that think the way I do..... thanks for reading this....
3,Not worth the money,"I wish I had the ocean aquarium swing instead of this one. The colors are very boring. My son likes the birds and the mirror when he looks up, but otherwise it's not worth the money."
5,Awesome!,It looks niceIt plays a lot of musicTheres many differnt speedsThe swing moves side to side or front to backIt was SO easy to put togetherWe love it!
3,Maybe I got a defective one,"I chose this swing because it looks so nice, and I wouldn't feel annoyed by it being out in our house. Plus I love the fanning leaf mobile, and how the cute little bugs spin around. It also has a mirror in the center of the mobil that points down to the baby..a feature I think she would have really liked. But my swing swings really fast and really hard. I timed the swing and there was no difference between the ""6 speeds"". I am returning it today. I think I will take my batteries to the store and see if the floor model works any better...otherwise I will find something different."
5,Snug as a bug in a rug...Zzzz!,"If you prefer to sleep after your little one arrives, buy this swing. Don't go cheap on this one or, boy, you will regret it every night for months and months. The only thing better than this swing is a few colic drops and this swing combined :-)"
5,Amazing product!,I purchased this swing because all my friends had it. But now I realize why - this swing is great. My child loves it. I have put her in other swings at my in-laws house and other friends and she can't stop crying. But when I put her in this one - it's like heaven.
4,Great swing,It's a great swing and works well to put my baby to sleep. My only complaint is that the music stops after a certain time. My baby tends to wake up when the music stops so I always have to rush to the swing to turn it back on.
5,A LIFE SAVER!,We finally found a swing that our daughter loves. She loves to be rocked in the swinging motion and after two weeks we finally found this swing to work the best for her. I think it swings slow enough on the slowest setting. Some other users may disagree. It is definitely worth the money and would recommend to anyone!
5,life saver STILL at 6 months old,"This swing is what my husband and I think is the best purchase we made for our baby and we made many. This has given me many nights sleep when my baby has been fussy and even now at 6 months old my baby loves it. He is currently teething and sometimes this is the only thing that will get him to sleep aside from me walking up and down the halls with him.The best thing about it is that it is silent and with one press it will rock him all night. I found it to be very expensive but it is worth every penny for the hours of peace it gives us. My baby is 26 inches tall and 18 pounds and still has no trouble fitting in it. We have are planning our second baby who will also be able to use it. The music turns off after 7 mintues so, if I am putting my baby to bed for the night, I turn on a sleepy cd for him instead."
3,Love this swing but not good for big babies,"When our son was first born we loved this swing, and so did he. However, he was a big baby (10 lbs 2 ounces at birth) and although this swing says it can hold up to 24 lbs, it no longer works for Kaden and he is only 16 lbs. When he is in it the motor isn't strong enough to make it swing more than a couple of inches either way, also, his weight makes the music sounds garbled and is obviously rough on the motor. We had to pack it up for the next baby, Kaden is only 3 months old and we really wish he would have been able to use this longer!"
4,Excellent swing- after the first month.,"We are so happy with this swing!! My baby girl takes at least one 2+ hour nap a day in it. As soon as I put her in she falls right to sleep. It is so much better for napping than the competition because of the shape of the seat. We have also had to wash the cover which was very easy to do and it still looks brand new. She loves looking up at the spinning birds, but they face outward, not down at her. The only drawback is that when she came home at 6+ lbs, the swing was too fast and big for her and it would make her sick. We weren't able to use it much until she was 12 lbs. because it was just too much for her. And sometimes her head falls off of the headrest to the side. We use the swing in the traditional front to back motion rather than side to side to help keep her from feeling sick. But the older she gets the more we love this swing! I would never get housework done without it!!!"
4,My daughter LOVES this swing,"Its a beautiful swing, neutral colors, soft fabrics, and a sleek design. I thought the mobile was boring at first but my daughter loves it. The only time she cries while in this swing is when the mobile turns off, which is why I wish the mobile was on a longer timer. There is a mirror under the mobile that she also loves. We've had the swing for 3 months and, with constant use, have only had to change the batteries once so far. Love that you have the chose to swing side to side, I like the different sounds and volume control, wish the tray toys were a little more interesting."
4,Wonderful Swing!,We just got this a few days ago but so far it's been great. The music is relaxing and the swing is quiet. I also think that the little guys on the mobile could be positioned better. Other than that my son seems comfortable in this swing and it usually calms him down and puts him to sleep when he is fussy.I did notice that the papasan swing sold at walmart.com has an extra feature.. lights...Well so far I am very pleased with this swing.
5,Must have for baby who always wants to be held!,"This swing has been a lifesaver. Our 6-week-old always wants to be rocked and held, but she loves sitting in this swing. We had the Graco 6-speed model, which was okay, but the side-to-side motion of the cradle swing puts our little girl to sleep faster than anything! It's super quiet too, which is great for nap time! I highly recommend it to any new parents."
1,Baby's head is deformed.,My baby love's the swing. But his head leans to the right side. The same thing happened with the Ocean Wonders swing. I sent both of them back and got a refund.
4,"It is OK, but it could be better","We started using the swing when my son was 3 months. He is now 7 months and he still likes it. However, it does not swing even if you put it to the highest level. My Sebastian is 17lbs and even though I have replaced the batteries it will only swing for a little while then stop. But he likes everything else about it and it keeps him occupied. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I chould."
3,Pretty Good Swing,"I got this for my colicky baby boy and it works decently. It goes through batteries like they are going out of style which might be typical for this kind of swing. The two positions are really not enough. Either he's reclined or sitting straight up. There's no inbetween. Assembly was relatively simple, but the toys are pretty mundane. All in all I would say this swing works well enough. I can't promise I would buy it again but it has served it's purpose."
4,Naptime!,"This swing is obviously comfortable, because my son falls asleep before the music stops playing and he also really enjoys looking in the mirror on the mobile... however, I don't understand why the creatures on the mobile point out and not down as I think that would keep him more interested in it. Also, the motor makes a strange swishing sound (and this is our second one because I thought something was wrong with the first one) and the lowest swing setting was way too fast for him when he was younger so I would just give him a little push every couple of minutes.. but he loves it and that is what is important!"
4,My baby loves this swing,"We originally bought this because of it's neutral design and look of absolute comfort. We weren't disappointed in that regard. So far, we've had NO problems with the mobile or the music. It does, however, drain batteries like you wouldn't believe! We ended up buying rechargeables and a charger and haven't had any issues.My daughter looooves looking at the mirror. She smiles and coos up at it, even before I turn the mobile on.One word of caution...When the swing is on the highest setting, it sort of walks. One day I was at the computer sitting right in front of her in the swing, when I heard a brushing sound. I looked up to find the swing brushing up against the coffeetable, with my now awakened daughter looking confused and irritated. So, we no longer use the highest setting, even though she really liked it. That is why I'm giving this only 4 stars. If it didn't do that, it would have 5 from me."
2,PLEASE READ!!!,"My sister bought this swing for my daughter. At first, I LOVED it and so did my daughter. She would sleep for hours in it and even after she got older she would bat at the mobile and coo with the music.I started to notice that one leg would come up as it rocked back and forth. This is SO annoying because you can't fix it no matter how many times you adjust it.But the most important thing that I want to share is that most recently, at 5 months, my daughter is wanting to move more. I have had to strap her in her swing because she likes to roll over. The seat belt came out of the swing AND SHE FELL OUT, TWICE. The first time I thought, ""Okay, I didn't do it properly."" But then it happened again and I look and she was strapped in TIGHT but if she tries to roll to one side the seat belt can easily come out of the hole.So terrifying and I can't believe my sister paid $150 for this thing! I did love it though, but I am reading these reviews and I am so disappointed!"
4,Great Warranty Offered By Fisher Price,My son loves this swing! I love the fact that Fisher Price will warranty the motor if necessary so the packaging can be thrown away. Simply go on line to the Fisher Price website to obtain their customer service number and you should receive a replacement motor (which is easily swapped out) within a couple of weeks!
2,Motor wears out FAST,"We purchased this swing TWICE and loved it for the firstfew months. Then BOTH swings' motors just stopped working.I will not continue to add to our land fills with another one!!!Tom, Massachusetts"
5,great product,"We registered for this swing, received it for a shower gift, and couldn't be happier.We've been using it almost daily for three months, and the batteries are still going strong.I feel that this swing is perfect for newborns and up because of the incline, you don't feel like your infant is going to fall out of it when it starts swinging.So, you can use it right away. The motor is very quiet.The colors of the swing, and fabric are very neutral and calming. We love the option to use the swing, or the cradle. We moved it up into our bedroom because our son sleeps the longest stretches in it at night. He is three months old now, and is now interested in the mobile, and mirror above. The music keeps him interested/or asleep. I even love the back pocket, which is useful for extra pacifiers in our case!"
1,Do not recommend this product,Our son abosuletly loved this swing and was one of the few ways we could calm him down. Plus it was his favorite place to take his naps. He is now 3 months old and we have returned this swing 3 times. The music either does not work or sounds like a skipping record. Plus the mobile no longer revolves and the swing stopped moving despite that it was set on the highest setting. I've called a few friends who have children around my son's age and have found that they also had problems with this product and were not completly satisfied. This product is completely faulty and not worth the aggravation or the cost.
1,Motor started to smoke while daughter was in it!,I read that this happened to someone else in another review. It has worked fine since December but today I smelled something funny and went in to find the top part smoking (my 3 month old was sound asleep in it). Thank goodness it did not catch fire or cause more harm. I called Fisher Price to report it. They should recall this item!
3,The mobile broke,"I fell in love with this swing from the first moment I saw it in the store, so I placed it on my registry and received it as a shower present.When my daughter was first born she didn't like it so much, mostly because she was very small compared to the seat of the swing. But after a couple of weeks she would stay and be very content swinging in the swing and very amuzed with the mobile. But after only a month of having the swing the mobile stopped working. Since I received this as a shower gift I don't have a receipt for it and no longer have the box so I can't exchange it or get a refund. But my daughter is now 6 months and still enjoys the swinging and music."
3,Swing settings bad for a newborn,"Swings way too fast and too much for my 7 pound newborn. Not sure if the baby will be able to use it when she gains weight, but instructions say ""only up to 20 lbs"", so that really limits the timeframe available to use it.1. they should specify a minimum weight along with the max weight.2. they should make the speed controls much more useful with the lowest control being much slower and the faster control being about where it is right now."
1,potential hazard,"I walked in one day to find my son hanging upside down, and twisted in the straps because the sides aren't high enough. Put it away after 3 months of use and brought it out for our newborn (they don't move much so I wasn't worried about finding him hanging upside down). When I pulled it out the motor no longer worked - I called to complain, and Fisher Price said - tough luck....even though the swing had only been used for 3 months, and the motor was bad....after reading the other's reviews - I felt lucky that mine didn't smoke."
2,Logans mom,I bought this swing because of the 6 speeds and neutral colors. Unfortunatly I have not been able to use it yet. I put my newborn in it when he was about a week old and even on the slowest speed it is way too fast for him. He is now a month old and it is still pretty fast. I am lucky to have had another swing on hand to use for now. Based on other reviews this swing is not very good for older babies since it doesn't incline very much so I am not sure how much use we are going to get from this. For the price of this swing we should have been able to use it from day one.
2,Nice looking with good features.,Like all the other reviews i like the way this swing looks and operates but the swing is to fast for baby! heck i don't even think there are six speed settings.. each one is fast with little or no variation between. if i felt like timing the rocks per minute i'd guess the lowest to be 45 per minute and the highest 47 or so. don't be fooled by the six speed gimick.
2,Not too thrilled,"Had I not thrown the box away I would have taken this swing back! First, it's way too bulky and heavy and hard to move around. Second, the lowest speed is too fast for a newborn. In fact, seems to be too fast for an older child even. I am really disappointed in this swing~ On the upside, the fan mobile is cute! :o)"
3,Not loving my swing,"At first this swing was great, My daughter loved it, the only thing I had to say was buy rechargable batteries. But now thats shes older( 6 months) the tray is a big issue, she wants it on so she can kick it, and watch it go flying threw the air. They should have attached one end, also not very friendly trying to get her in and out of this thing. Now that shes bigger I have to really watch her head the mobile is a little to close."
4,Fisher Price Bouncy and Swing,"The Fisher Price Bouncy and Natures Touch Swing look like beautiful items, I have not had the pleasure of trying them out yet, my comment is inregards to the process of ordering these items on line, the advertisement is very scarce on information pertaining to the actual color of each, I see pink on the website and in knowing that we are having a girl was very interested in the pink color, come to find out after months of trying to get the right color shipped to me these items only come in green!! I think that Amazon should really try to fix this problem so that future customers know exactly what color these items come in. Thank-you Dawn"
3,"Great swing, but motor is loud","Great item to keep baby entertained, but it is quite loud. I am going to call the company as I think its a bad motor."
3,Lifesaver!,"This swing saved my husband and me for about a month when our newborn wouldn't sleep in her crib. She loved getting rocked to sleep, and trust me...I didn't have the energy to do that all night.PROS:-I like that you can turn the swing from front-to-back or side-to-side.-Music and turning mirror captivated our daughter. She still loves to stare at herself in the overhead mirror.CONS:-Needs to have a plug-in option. Uses many D batteries!-Makes an annoying clicking noise. While it really bothered me, seemed to be just the white-noise my daughter needed to sleep.-Space hog-The head cushion isn't removable (although it is adjustable). I would rather have had a removable headrest so I could put my own headrest in (kiddopotamus one). She just didn't quite fit in the seat right, so I had to prop her with various blankets.All in all, it just may save your life when you need some time to get some chores done or sleep!"
1,Far too little padding for the price!!!,"I was stuck on getting a Baby Papasan Swing, to go along with the Papasan Bouncer that I bought several months ago. *However* upon ""testing"" the swing out @ Babies R Us, I was VERY disappointed!! The padding, particuarly in the back, is so cheap and thin, I cannot believe how much they're charging for this thing! I think the fancy design fools a lot of expectant parents into thinking it's really comfy for the baby, but please see for yourself before buying this! I went with the Fisher Price Aquarium Swing instead, for $30 cheaper, and LOVE it! The padding is GREAT and the features are way better than this over-priced swing!"
4,Awesome product,This swing is worth every penny! But I recommend using it on 'older' babies as the FIRST setting swings a bit forcefully for our newborn - and it had 6 speeds!
4,The perfect sleep and play swing!,"This swing is great, my baby is both entertained by it and put to sleep by it, it's really comfy and soft, he loves the noises and especially the mirror. The cover is easily removable and washes up great. I gave it only four stars because it's larger than most swings and does take up a bit of space, so if you don't have a lot of room this swing is not for you. But if you do have the room this is the swing to get. I love that it goes either back and forth or side to side, it also reclines for sleeping!"
1,Complete Rubbish,"I have just put together this expensive supposedly fantastic swing and I am completely disappointed in it....it hardly swings, the music is tinny and cuts out - it sounds like it is running on flat batteries right from the start even though it has had two different lots straight out of the packet in it....the seat is comfortable and mirror is nice but other than that a total waste of money. AND because I have to take a leap of faith and have these things shipped out to me in Japan at great expense it will only cost me more to ship it back and then have another one sent to me....DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Noisy motor,"We bought this swing because a friend of ours bought one and their baby loves it. I like that the seat tray is detachable and that the seat swings in two directions. However, the motor makes a really loud humming noise. The one our friends purchased also makes the humming noise. One of the reviewers here said her motor was quiet so I guess you take your chances with the motor. I already got rid of the box so can't return it. I just hope our baby likes the loud motor noise! It's so loud it drowns out the nature sounds!"
4,It's as soothing as it looks!,We picked this swing because I wanted something she could fall asleep in easily and be comfortable. This is a great swing...make sure to stock up on D batteries because they run out fast. The only drawback to this swing is that our little one is going to outgrow it in 5 more pounds...plus I wish the song that is played would change every time you put it on (that's what my bassinet mobile does).
5,LOVE THIS TOO!,"Our son loves his swing and so do I. It's the best nap that I get out of him all day long. He's 3 1/2 months old and has just discovered the mobile and mirror above him - something else for him to ""talk"" to:) We have used this since he was about a month old and have replaced batteries twice, but we use this every day - several times a day. It's definitely worth it and I really don't think that an average of once a month is bad at all."
5,Heidi's Review,"This is an excellent swing. It is very comfortable for newborns, and it grows with the baby for many many months."
3,"They really do mean ""small""!","This pillow is wonderful. I've used buckwheat pillows for years and they can't be beat for support. The millet side is absolutely luxurious. It really is silky smooth! Both of them together make this the best pillow I've ever tried to sleep on, at least texture-wise. There's just one problem: this pillow is so small that it looks like a doll pillow. The measurements provided here must have been the unfilled pillow. The filled pillow is actually closer to 12x9"". It's so small that when I sleep on my side (which is most of the night) it doesn't provide enough support and I wake up sore. I'll probably wind up buying the larger duo pillow to sleep on and using this one for travel or as a lumbar pillow.If this pillow really was 14x11 as stated -when filled and ready for use- I would've given it 5 stars."
4,Millet/Buckwheat Pillow,"This pillow is exactly what I was looking for in months. I had the same size, with millet filling only, since - well, since ever. This kind with double pockets for millets and buckwheats is even better. The only reason I give that pillow only four stars is because it is filled TOO much! But after taking out from each compartment a certain amount, it is mostly flat and the way I like it. The 2 compartments are a hit. Some reviewers complained about the size indicated not being correct but it is when you measure it flat out. Very good product for a very good price."
4,small kind small,"super nice pillow, but it is pretty small. i would definitely recommend shelling out the extra bucks for the large"
5,"Very Pleasant, and a Great Voice",This vocal jazz music is so pleasant and easy to listen to. Such a beautiful voice. Very approachable and enjoyable for anyone new to jazz.
4,Very pleasant,It truly is a shame we lose so many very talented artists early in years. Susannah MCCorkle has a voice showing great emotion. Her songs ring straight to the heart.
4,Quality Time is a joke people!,"I'm surprised at how many people are busting on Quality Time. If you read the liner notes, you'll find the song was written to make fun of the people described in the song. It's sarcastic, it's a joke... a joke many of you failed to get apparently."
5,Word Lover's Feast,"This book is fun to read, especially the description of the life of Englisc (an original spelling) told as if it were a person. Even the Bethump'd Lite games are challenging enough for an adult to enjoy."
1,BMG is out to lunch!,"I give this recording only one star not because the recordings are bad but simply because they've been released so many times! I bought this recording thinking surely that many of Perry's songs previously recorded in stereo would have been released that way because of the claim regarding ""original masters"" having been used. But alas, such is not the case. If you want to hear Perry's 1958 hit record ""Kewpie Doll"" in real stereo, you'll need to find a friend in England to buy the Reader's Digest 3 CD box set for mega dollars because they won't sell it to you directly!. There's something rediculous going on here! And now they're going to do it all over again next week with yet another greatest hits CD, this time called ""The Very Best of Perry Como"" where the same songs will be repeated all over again! I wonder if any of them will be original masters but what does that claim really mean? Not much, apparently!"
4,I love Perry Como ballads,"The CD is very good, but has so many lighter songs that Perry Como was famous for. I like the ballads the best so ordered the CD ""An Enchanted Evening"" with Perry Como, and it has most of my favorites on that CD/"
2,What you see is what you get!,"Only buy this compact disc if you really want the songs and the collection makes sense to you after reading the list of titles. There is nothing special here. The masters are litereally ""off-the-shelf"" and all but a very few are repeats from other compilations including the mistakes! Como fans will have virtually all of these songs and for new Como fans, the suggestion that these are his ""Greatest Hits"" is clearly a misrepresentation having only three songs here from the last 40 years! Even as an early collection of Perry's first 15 years with RCA Victor, the set is certainly not definitive. These new kids at BMG should take time out to meet Perry Como and then, perhaps, they would treat his recorded legacy with a little more respect!"
1,Lousy Atrocious Song,"Perry is good and so are most of the songs. Since I hate ""Bushel & a Peck,"" that cost this one two stars. That is a very irritating song and I can't stand the lyrics. I truly hate it and would never wish it on anybody."
4,Still crooning after all these years,"I read the criticism of the quality of this 2-CD set before I bought it, but decided to proceed. The sound quality is less than optimal, but acceptable to relive the Perry Como years. I was interested in hearing only one of the songs sung, but I'm pleased to have this Perry Como songbook on my playlist. No question the production quality could be higher, but Perry's distinctive style shines right through the deficits."
2,Poor sound quality; terrible shipping,"I agree with all those who say the sound quality is not good - and if I can tell, it must be pretty bad! But my biggest problem was the shipping. The CD's arrived in a padded manila envelope, and of course the CD case was broken. Amazon has made numerous promises to replace it, and told me twice that a new case has been shipped. All I can say is that if it has shipped, it must be arriving by foot because I have yet to see it."
3,"Fine performances, mediocre audio quality","Other reviewers have touched on my misgivings with the selections put into this collection. Perhaps the RCA/BMG managers of this asset imagine that listeners new to Perry Como will start here based solely on this collection's title? If so, that foretaste may not lead to listeners dipping deeper into the Perry Como collection. Como's voice deserves/deserved better. The arrangements border on trite or downright silly, and the audio quality, with a few exceptions (""Catch a Falling Star,"" ""Round and Round"" aren't bad) is distressingly inferior. At times the quality is so poor that the recordings more closely resemble early 20's-30's 78's. The album was produced by Paul Williams for House of Hits Productions, according to the jewelcase cover, with audio restoration by Bill Lacey. If the original masters were that bad, it's tragic for Mr. Como, his family & descendants."
4,Three orginals and talented special guests,"Contempoary christmas collage of mountain music both generous in spirt and acoustical profoundness.Hey- simply a real good roll'n listen.The orginals and two other seldom used selections make it a must have for those yearning uniqueness.I'm somewhat suprised they waited this long to release a yuletide effort,but it's been a showcase to thier craftsmanship as accomplished artists.Thanks."
3,Dirt Band Christmas,"The nitty gritty dirt band performs many christmas classics such as ""we three kings"" and ""silent night"". They provide their own country rendition to these classics especially ""Jingle Bells"". There are also a few new songs such as ""Christmas Dinner"" and ""one Christmas tree"".Each song is played in the dirt bands own unique style. They bring a freshness to such xmas standards as ""We three kings"" and ""Jingle Bells"". 3 1/2 stars."
5,Thoreau Has Nothing on Me,A funny and interesting journey into the home production of maple syrup. The comparison of Thoreau's life on Walden Pond and Perrin's life as a sugar maker. A wonderful trip through the process of syrup production.
1,book sold as a stone house guide is anti GWB soap box,"The title of the book indicates that one is purchasing a book on stone house construction. The sad part is there are no new ideas in this book, other than some basic math, for load calculations. The author vears off the track several times to spleen his anger at President GWB and the Saudis. Not one to leave anyone out of the act, he makes it clear that Home Depot is not one of his favorite American Coroprations. For the money there are many other books that cover this same topic of construction, stay on topic, and do not subject the reader to what sounds like the rantings of an out of control teenage kid, as opposed to someone that supposedly has a Masters Degree."
1,"I don't want to argue, but...","Marketing wins again-a fair guitar player singing questionable songs for her age, but this aint a blues album and should not be treated as such. Much is made of her age, but if you want to hear an outstanding debut by a young woman singing the blues, look for Shemekia Copeland's album. Five stars for this album. No way."
1,Stupid Human Tricks,"I saw her on David Letterman and honestly thought I was watching ""stupid human tricks."" The power of Big Record Label Marketing has propelled grade school talent night onto national TV. Yuck! Double Yuck!"
5,WOW,Buy it Crank it! From start to finish this 14yr. old sounds like a seasoned veteran. Jonny Lang adds his talent to this. Sounds like the start of something good.
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"WOW! There must be something in the water in Fargo, ND! First, Johnny Lang, and now Shannon Curfman! This young lady can ROCK! :) Her voice and guitar-playing talent are absolutely amazing -- especially taking into consideration she's so young.I'm glad to support an exceptional young lady and home-town talent!"
4,Good start,"Curfman has a wide vocal style range. Think raw Melissa Etheridge and sweet young new singer. The guitar play is good. A good album, worth having."
5,"Voice & Guitar to make Jimi, Robert, and Bonnie proud!!","After hearing 'Ture Friends' on the radio and discovering that the voice and guitar belonged to a 13 year-old, I know that I had to check out the CD. As a 19-year old lover of Blues and Classic Rock, I feel that Shannon Curfman has definately taken a big step in pushing her way onto the list of the greats! I saw Shannon live in Wichita, Kansas after buying the CD and was extremely blown away! If you ever get the chance to see this girl live, make it a point to!! Her rendition of Robert Johnson's, ""Malted Milk"" will forever be etched in my mind as one of the finest covers ever done live!! Her outstanding guitar playing pays tribute to those who have gone before her and her voice will amaze you! This is a DEFINATE must have for any blues/guitar fan!"
4,Birth Of A Legend,"I purchased this disk after I heard her on Jay Leno. The song, ""Playing With Fire"" absolutely blew me away. This girl sings with authority, and plays with a maturity far beyond her years. There are no weak songs on this disk, although I would expect that future disks will be organized better. I also liked ""Few And Far Between"", ""If You Change Your Mind"", ""Hard To Make A Stand"", ""Never Enough"", and ""I'm Coming Home"" very much. This disk gets better with every listen and I imagine I will be enjoying it and others by Shannon Curfman for years to come."
4,Can Play With the Best!,"Shannon Curfman's CD is unbelievable. I had the opportunity to see her on the Rosie O'Donnell Show and she totally blew me away. Who cares how old she is? She could sit and jam with the best of them and I mean the best...B.B., Clapton, S. Ray Vaughn - who ever - she could hold her own. This girl is going A LONG WAY with blisters on her fingers cus man ... she can jam!"
4,Just Listen to the Dang CD!,"This is a very good CD. Shannon is extremely talented. There are a couple of ""misses"" here, but overall it's an above-average debut. Is it ""real"" blues...perhaps not, but the blues influence is there and unmistakeable. If you like Jonny Lang or Kenny Wayne Sheppard or Wynonna Judd or Sheryl Crow or Bonnie Raitt, I doubt that you will completely dislike this record. If you don't like or respect those artists and their ""sound,"" or if you don't think 14-year-old girls have the right or experience or ""whatever"" to sing bluesy songs with a risque lyric here and there, then by all means save your money. ""Few and Far Between"" is my favorite here, but I would call at least six or seven of this 11-song package ""good songs."" This album is far better than what one would expect from anyone of Shannon's age. It's not worthy of five stars (I give it 3 1/2, rounded to 4) but with a bit more development her future efforts just might be."
1,"I Hate to do this to the kid, but....................","I've heard it, and I've seen her and she doesn't get it yet. Now it's a bit unfair to judge someone of such a tender age, but this girl is just not ready to be out there yet. I saw her at the Chicago Blues Festival a few years back and: 1) I was outraged that the organizers would see fit to put her up on the stage with so many other great players that live in this town available 2) I was embarrassed for her as she was clearly in WAY over her head. She was being billed as a blues player , but she didn't have a clue. Now most of us don't want to be judged by what we did in our teens, but I didn't tell her to get out there this soon. If this was a high school talent show, sure I'd be impressed- but it's not. Maybe she'll grow into something , but my suspicion is that it's not going to happen, as there's no evidence here to make one think that she will pan out."
1,Don't Get It,"I took the plunge and bought a CD of someone I hadn't really heard, but had heard of. Oops. Big mistake. This disc is banal and a bore. I don't get it at all, why the good reviews, comparisons to great artists, on this page?"
1,Awful,"100% marketing. O% Blues. Pedestrian Guitar. Vocal Mimicry. Another reason to despise major record labels : There are a lot of real, talented, worthy blues artists out there, and they cram this contrived tripe down our throats."
4,Will Blow You Away!,I got to hear Shannon for the first time opening for John Mellencamp!! Couldn't believe the talent - and then to find out she's only 14! She will definately be one to enjoy now and in the future!!
5,AWESOME ARTIST,"Although there are a couple of other artist's pieces on this CD, Shannon's originality comes thru with flying colors. Already a big Lang fan, this is basically a female version of him. Her haunting voice reminded me a lot of Joplin and her guitar work was incredible. It's well worth purchasing."
4,Almost creepy,"I don't think I've ever been this excited about a young performer's potential before. This album is rock-solid, and some of the lyrics are quite a bit smarter than one might expect--in ""Playing with Fire"" in particular one gets the sense that Shannon is quite aware of just what a perilous road she may be starting down. I've been listening to the album daily, and give it four stars only because I understand, at 14, Shannon must have room to grow. It's almost scary to think what she'll be like in 10 years, when she's had the real-world experience to go with her oft-adult lyrics. But I look forward to being there!"
4,I wonder if Charlotte Church has this problem?,"Wow! Some people are really offended that someone has talent and dares to use it. Talk about sounding like a bunch of snobs! I applaud Shannon for exploring a different genre of music than her peers, who are into that hip-hop, teeny bopper thing. She's more rock than blues, but I like it. Contrary to the thoughts of previous reviewers, I am not a ""victim of marketing."" No-one decides what I like, nor what I choose to listen to. I had never heard of Shannon Curfman before. By chance, I had the opportunity to hear ""True Friends"" and ""The Weight,"" and was blown away. The girl has talent; who cares how old she is? The day that talent is somehow related to driving age/ability, we're all in trouble! Keep rockin, Shannon."
4,Beware the one star reviews herein...,"Doesn't anyone else find it a little fishy that all of the people issuing one-star reviews are listed only as ""music fan""? It's quite possible that some axes are getting ground...With that said, I am officially changing my rating of this disc from 5 stars down to 4 stars. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this disc doesn't match up well with other CDs that I consider ""5 star"" (Counting Crows' August and Everything After; R.E.M.'s Automatic for the People; Pearl Jam's Ten; etc.).I still very much enjoy this CD, and Shannon has an immense amount of both talent and potential. When she releases a CD that is as consistent and thematic as the three I listed above, I will be a very happy person. That's when I will issue that final star."
3,"Good, but over-rated","I think Shannon is a talented young musician with extraordinary vocal talent. But, I find her guitar work to be over-rated. She's good, but not spectacular."
3,Shannon Rocks!,"I am so pleased to see Shannon Curfman starting to get more attention lately. This CD is a strong debut, particularly for someone so young. Her powerful vocals and sizzling guitar work belie her age. What a shame that we've got the pop queens like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera topping the charts, with just a tiny percentage of the talent Shannon Curfman displays. She writes, sings, plays; she does it all! I bought the CD just to contribute to her rise and to place a vote for her above those other teen pop stars. May her success be long-lived, while those others' will certainly fade from our memories in a short time."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air,Simply put....the young lady has soul. I was impressd with the maturity of her vocals and her guitar work......Look forward to future releases.
5,Wow -- this is great!,"I first heard Shannon in concert when she was touring with the Indigo Girls. I ordered this CD within 20 minutes of getting home! Shannon plays and sings far beyond her years; plus, her songs don't get old quickly. This is one of my favorite driving CDs. I can listen to it 3 or 4 times in a row before I get tired of it."
5,Oh yeah!,"She has the chops and she has a fine set of pipes. Lord the girl can sing. Can't wait to hear more from her. A major talent, not a bad cut on this one. If you dig the blues and like women blues singers this one cuts right into your heart but it hurts so good."
4,I like it sorta,"This one is long and somewhat difficult, Gilad never tells you what weights he has in his hands. Posture is everything when it comes to sculpting and toning as well."
2,gilad sculpt and tone workout,"didnt like it too much, was hoping that it targets specifuc muscle groups instead of circuit training. was too easy i wanted somwthing more challenging,"
4,Maze madness has its smiles,"Evolution Worlds is a great game. Be persistant. You won't like the begining. Other than a small battle, it's almost fifteen straight minutes of dialoge! But when you get to control the character, called Mag Launcher, things get fun. There's only a few other downsides. On a quest you can't save until you find a save spot. Luckly you can temporalily save when you reach another floor. Then of course there's the matter of finding your way around. Beware extream case of the word:Boring. However that is made up for by voiceovers for almost all dialoge. All in all, you should give this game a chance."
3,A Decent RPG,"This is one RPG that I can only give a ""decent"" to. It has a pretty good story line and has a good battle system, but I found the dungeons to be monotonous and just plain uninteresting. It did, however, keep my attention throughout the entire game. Therefore, I give it 3 stars."
3,Really dont know....,"The Dreamcast version got boring really quickly so I wouldnt say this game is any better. Although there are the ever-changing dungens the game for Dreamcast just isnt very good. Why should this one be better? I dont know, but the Dreamcast version was too kiddy for me."
4,LONG AND BORING.,"if you like dungeon crawls buy this game now, you cant beat the price. but for the rest of us the games storyline while entertaining and great and all, just isn't enough to support the hours of dungeoning. and for those of you such as myself who like to 100% complete games, this game requires a replay and will take you somewhere around 150 in game hours to fully collect the required money, items, and trinkets that appear on a unknown randomized basis."
2,Buy Skies of Arcadia Legends insteadh,"Ok, if you want a good RPG for the GCN, this is not it. ... I don't think this game is worth it. Really monotonous dungeons and battles, though the anime looking characters are nice. Skies of Arcadia Legends is so much better than this game ..."
3,Good reference book. I expected more...,"No khmer script. There are 282 pgs, but 1/3 of this is the bibliography. Summaries of stories and poems are all in english. Too bad, it would have been better if Ms. Jacob include the khmer scripts."
1,it loooks good on a beretta,its on a beretta not a 1911. so whats aperson todo with the 1911s saftey?just yank it off? or cut down the grip? or buy a beretta? just another example of blind commerce.i think that someone should vette theses products and listings before they are offered.
4,Wow,I really enjoyed this album . It great music to relax too. It great too unwind too when you come home at night.
3,Interesting variations on themes...,I found this collection to be a interesting mix and worth the used price I paid for it but I would not have bought this new now that I have heard it. I did not like some of the productions that seemed amateur in mixing quality. The music and performance was great...the technical aspects of the recording poor.Edit 10/5/12:My original comments still hold but this grows on you and gets better appreciated as you break the mold of original expectations! Stella is stellar!!!!
5,Andreas always good.,"I have listened to many of Andrea's,s cds there is some I like and others with guest singers I do not get into, this one has many of his older tracks but it is live. I like it it is a very good recording as usual."
2,disappointed,From listening to the clips I expected something new. All songs are shortened versions of original. Love his music and creativity but the cd is somewhat impotent compared with his other releases.
2,This game did not age well,"I was a fan of the original Altered Beast (Before Sega Genesis) and I used to plop several quarters in the machine when I was a kid.This version on Gameboy however did not age well. First of all, the creatures that player morphs into in the game are badly drawn out. Secondly, the game is repetitious to the point where it gets tiring. The biggest problem however is the small GBA screen which makes it difficult to move your character around. In the Arcade, there was a benefit of a large screen and it makes all the difference in the world.THQ did their best in making the game but I think the concept was tired out and it should of be laid to rest. I can only recommend this to Hardcore fans."
2,Auto-Fire Punch Button,"I've seen DIGIMON GAMES that are more interesting than this game. And we all know what age group digimon is for.The storyline: you must retrieve a lot of amulets (or something). There are several parts of each special item (whatever it is), each of which product a slightly different result. Each item transforms you into something, and you've got to keep repeating the levels in order to get all the versions of that item. In the first level, you become a werewolf. The second time through, I think the werewolf was blue. I couldn't identify the morph form on the second level.So, if you want a fighting game so interesting that it rivals Harvest Moon, then go ahead. If you want a fighting game that's intersting, try Mortal Combat. Or a digimon game. Both are better than this."
2,Mineless Combat,"Traditional Gamer - See ""Golden Sun"" for more information. I sorry but beating up tons of monsters is not a fun game."
1,misleading,"wrong book for me also,no picture of cover and wrong description ,glad it was only a couple of bucks, I got screwed"
1,NOT All Mine to Give of 1957 movie,I bought this thinking it was the story about the day they gave the babies away...Don't be fooled by these reviews. This is not a good story about a family!
1,This is NOT All Mine to Give of 1957!!,These reviews are not for this book. I ordered it and it is some sleazy novel! Please don't be fooled into thinking this is a good story about a family!
2,Disappointing,"Interesting, if only it had an end. How is this connected to WWII? The kids would be late thirty-somethings. And are they the bad guys? I wish I knew. Lots of ugly adults. Maybe something in the water? An audience deserves more. The photography, highly praised, is tiresome, overexposed. Fast forward."
2,Two an a half hours wasted,"This has all the makings of a ""critically acclaimed"" movie. It's shot in black and white, has a slow (boring) tempo, portrays Germans as degenerates, has a vague indeterminate ending, and is overall depressing. Obviously, the theme of the movie is that the rise of the Germans as aggressors in the world wars was because the Christian German people are a bunch of cruel, lowlife degenerates. This is racist and patently untrue. The Germans became aggressors because their leaders filled the heads of their people with lies, told them that they were in danger from an attack, and dissent was unpatriotic (sound familiar?). Do yourself a favor and find something else to do with those 144 minutes!"
1,Just Awful.,"Ok, the cinematography is great, the acting is good, and yes, we get the symbolism. But beyond that, this movie is 140 minutes of painfully slow shallow plot. The movie bares not the slightest resemblance to a Twilight Zone episode (as some have claimed), if for no other reason than the story has no recognizable ending. The movie does a haphazard job of ""weaving"" a suspenseful story line without giving the viewer any reward for his/her patience.Seriously, just awful."
1,A waste of 144 minutes,"Watching this film would have been a waste of my time had it not been for the fact that i watched it during a snow storm---little else to do otherwise.I usually enjoy foreign language films but this one dragged on and on.I had no interest in any of the characters,there was no suspense and really there was no point to it all.The ending was like the rest of the movie rather vanilla."
1,Not even one star! I'm sorry I wasted my time!,"I strongly recommend avoiding this film if you like to watch films for entertainment purposes. The other one star reviewers gave honest descriptions, I do not need to repeat what they have said. I watched this movie on my DVR and often checked the remaining minutes, not sure if I should stop watching it or continue, seeing closure, or for something to happen that would pull it all together. No such luck. I have never felt compelled to write a movie review before, but this time I did because I hope I can spare others the waste of time and utter disappointment that this film brings.If you enjoy watching people hurt each other physically and mentally, in a dark and gloomy atmosphere, this film is for you. The acting and technical quality of this film is very good, but the content is miserable, depressing, pointless, and is exceptionally difficult to follow.I only hope that you heed my advice and avoid this film for you own well-being."
4,good film,"This movie has a timeless feel, much like the early art house thrillers. I enjoyed the mystery and suspense along with realistic story telling and good cinematography."
5,My favorite Haneke's film,"All I can say is that, although the film is slow paced, at the end I didn't want to get up, I wished the film to continue for at least 2-3 more hours. I saw it 3 times at the local cinema and now, after almost 2 years, on DVD. This is my favorite Michael Haneke's film."
2,"Pretentious, Self-Righteous Drivel","Not that I don't like the Bergmanesque pace of the film: That's the best part IMO, though simple to pull off. No, I dislike the ignorant, preening contempt for pre-WWI Germans by coddled, soft, well-to-do, know-nothing moderns. BTW, I think what most bothers ""progressive"" Germans and their offshoots about the two wars is not that their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents ""started"" them, but that they LOST them.But nevermind. As Churchill said, the Hun is either at your throat or at your feet. I think you can guess where the luvvies who created this effort are situated. Could that change? No, because the Germans don't reproduce anymore. Thank God.All right. What ARE the roots of National Socialism? Same as International Socialism: Rousseau. Read him, if you actually, you know, read books."
5,Film Making at Its Finest,This film feels as thought it was actually filmed in the years before WWI - it is a frightening story that will leave the viewer with much to think about and to discuss with others who have seen this German film noir. It has to be one of the best films I have seen in years. I saw it in the movie theater and it was so provocative that I decided to buy the DVD so I could watch it again together with the extras on the disc. It is allegorical and portrays evil for evils sake.
4,"GOOD HANEKE, BAD SUBTITLES","I have enjoyed all the Michael Haneke films I have seen so far, and this is perhaps his best effort yet, but it is hard to tell really just how good because the film is black and white with all the old problems of black and white foreign films and white subtitles. The font is smaller than usual, which isn't a big problem on a large screen, but much of the background is either white or light gray making the legibility difficult. Sometimes I had to give up trying to read dialogue and either guess at plot develpment or just wait for the next scene shot with darker subject matter. With their small size, even outlining the subtitles is black didn't help; still illegible much of the time. Someone should redo this rather fine release and reissue it properly.While picture quality is quite adequate, it didn't come up to the Blu-ray standards possible for a film made today. Perhaps it was transferred from a PAL video onto Blu-ray, who knows."
3,DVD film....,"It is different which I like,but not what I expected based on film description....more subtle impact...if you like story telling,then you might appreciate aspects of this film as I did...."
2,Not very good...,"I did not really enjoy this movie. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is good, but the movie failed for me. While it was a bit ""mysterious"" and the acting was very engaging, I felt like the script plodded along at snail's pace without enough things going on to engage me in the movie itself. I cannot recommend this movie mainly for that reason."
5,A classic film,"Set in a German village prior to World War I, this film shows how a secretive, harshly punitive, and joyless society penetrates the daily life of families to create mean children who will grow up to embrace fascism. A classic film."
3,Not bad.,"Not a bad read, if a bit predicatable in spots and a bit implausible where it isn't predicatable; we're supposed to accept that the ""White Wolf"" isn't really so bad, although he was prepared to destroy Picard and his crew if they hadn't gotten the upper hand on him, and that a Starfleet captain would fire on a fellow captain and his ship to defend someone rather than attempting to discuss the matter like a reasonable being? And that Picard would have simply accepted these actions once their rationale was explained? I think not; these are dangerous games they're playing, and somebody could have gotten hurt. I can't believe that Picard would have gone along with them so readily."
4,A great follow on from the book The Valiant,Read the book The Valiant first and then read this book. It is great to read about the early stages of Picard in this series of books.
3,first in series,I liked this book and will eventually read others in this series. 3.5 stars but if you dont read this one you may miss out on some real gems later in the series.
1,The Worst Star Trek Novel I've Ever Read,"According to the author the crew of the Stargazer are racist, liars, gullible, and plain stupid. The actual story doesn't begin until three-quarters of the way through the book. In the meantime we are exposed to the crew of the ship and their harrowing adventures, such as deciding whether to eat tuna salad or salmon.One character is a xeno-racist, but apparently so are many others since they laugh at the antics of the racist.The entire book is cardboard characters and mindless scenes. One of my favorite authors, Ben Bova, wrote a book about writing Science Fiction. In that book he states that an author needs to begin a story with some conflict to catch the readers attention. This book waits until chapter 16 to do anything. The only reason I kept reading is because I lost [money] on it.Summary: A blank journal provides a better story."
1,"Very descriptive , but story is awfull.","Picard? First misssion as a captain and he disobeys his orders and turns a blind eye to another starfleets captain trying to kill him and his crew of the stargazer by a federation ship? The admiral out to get picard to discredit him and another admiral story simply goes nowhere. Starts with good details of his disdain for Picard, but then just goes away. Some characters are just too much filler pages of nonsense. Then the book just ends in a cute exchange between number one and a junior officer learning she was too much of a stickler for starfleet regulations and the end. Do not waste your time as I did on this book."
5,Wishbone Ash Live At XM Satellite Radio Studio 2004!,"This live broadcast recorded November 22, 2004 at the XM Satellite Radio Studios in Washington D.C. showcases just how great Wishbone Ash still are despite numerous personel changes throughout the years. It's very upfront and personal with original lead guitarist/vocalist Andy Powell talking with what appears to be a small audience chosen for this recording. The bulk of the songs are, for the most part, classic Wishbone Ash such as ""The King Will Come"", ""Warrior"", ""Throw Down The Sword"", ""Blowin' Free"", ""Ballad Of The Beacon"", ""F.U.B.B."", ""Living Proof"" plus later tracks ""Faith, Hope & Love"", and ""Almighty Blues"". The songs are played to perfection with soaring dual lead guitar solos and the sound quality of this recording is nothing less than superb. Also, this was the fourth gig for new Wishbone Ash guitarist Muddy Manninen. The liner notes are few but informative. Wishbone Ash fans will definately want to add this to their cd collection."
5,Pleasently Surprised,"I was not expecting much from this CD having been disappointed by some of the more recent Wishbone Ash releases. What a surprise. The sound quality was good and the band played well off of the crowd. It does not have the impact and energy of the original line up (check out ""Live Dates"") but I did enjoy it quite a bit."
1,Browning? I think not,"I bought this specifically to heat small 6"" frozen pizzas. The old brand of pizza came with the paper/plastic browning tray and worked very well. The new brand had no tray so I needed a browning surface to avoid bubbling center. This wasn't much better than a plain old plate - the ribbed side worked better than the flat side. It may be ok for bacon? but not pizza."
4,Good Bacon,The bacon is nice and crisp from this without the grease. My only complaint is the fact it cannot be put in the dishwasher. A little hard to get off the residue baked-on bacon.
3,Round is Good; Cleaning a Bit Tough.,I bought this because the one I had was square and I would have to turn off my turntable in the microwave when I used it. Well this spins - but I was hoping it would clean up a bit easier. They need to widen the grooves so a scruber can fit it and get off the grease. If you buy this - clean immediately after use or it's a real pain.
3,okay,The bacon still gets pretty greasy when I use this. There should be a better way to nuke bacon but I haven't yet found one.
2,Hard to clean,This rack allows fat to drain from the meat but it is very hard to clean. You will spend more time cleaning this rack than cooking or eating the food.
4,love it,The only thing that I would suggest is that we have to spray it with Pam before microwaving. Seems to be extremely hard to clean. My Mom has one that came with her Microwave and it is darker in color and not having problems of cleaning. I am hoping as it seasons it will become easier. But none the less. It is the most wonderful microwave product helper I have ever had and it makes the best bacon!
3,the finish is marred,"on the flat side used for pizza the finish is marred. also, i found for pizza that the tray needs to be preheated in the microwave for 3-5 minutes in order to get it hot enough to make the pizza crust not be soggy. the microwave pizzas come with a paper tray that crisps the pizza and does not need to be preheated. this product might be more successful for bacon, but it looks like it would be hellish to clean between the ridges. the tray does NOT come with a tool shaped like the ridges to make scraping in these valleys easier. for just a few dollars more you can get a realGeorge Foreman GR10B 36 Square Inch Nonstick Countertop Grill, Black."
4,Good cooker,"I wish the channel for the bacon fat was a little deeper like the old one I had that this replaced, but it's a good alternative."
3,Not worth it,"I used this item twice and put it away and haven't wanted to use it again. A paper plate lined with paper towels is much easier to clean up and the bacon cooks much faster and more evenly. Not only do you have to scrub the bacon grill, you have to wash the cover as well. Too much work."
5,Have had one for years - nothing works better!!,"We have used one of these with a cover for many years - we have not found an easier way to cook bacon without the mess or grease splatter. I drilled holes in the cover to let the steam out, but without letting the splatter out. It would be helpful if they made a cover with steam holes. After many uses, the base becomes yellowed and takes the scratchy side of the sponge to clean between the splines, but it is still much easier than cooking bacon in a frying pan. We cook bacon every week and highly recommend it. We tried all the others - you need to be sure to have am 11 inch cover that fits inside the edges. We replace the base every four-five years after it gets too yellowed and brittle."
3,"It's OK, but not great","This item works well, however I find the round shape difficult to use when cooking bacon. It's also very hard to clean, so I'm looking for another one."
5,"Finally, a round bacon tray!","It is SO hard to find a round bacon tray! My mom would complain everytime she used the square one because it wouldn't rotate and hit the walls. She even went as far as filing down the corners, and it still didn't work. When I saw this I got it (and the microwave plate cover which goes nicely with this) and she is SO happy! No more complaining! ; )"
3,OK - but just for small amount of bacon,"If you are cooking more than a couple of slices of bacon, you will need to ""cut up"" slices into pieces as this is not a large cooker. However, it will allow your microwave turntable to rotate, which larger cookers will not.... it's a tradeoff."
4,Makin' bacon,"We really like the Nordic Ware and use it to cook our bacon (too) frequently. After I ordered it, my husband found the same thing at Wal-mart for $1 less...oops!"
2,don't buy,The bale ? is in the wrong place -it would be better IF on top as it becomes too heavy- other reviewer was right. all of the other peora i bought were beautiful in this order.
4,Good item,"The dash on this model year is strange, so this dash kit is a must if installing single DIN aftermarket radios. I wish they put the slot below the deck not above it, oh well. Looks great and fits perfect. Easy to use and install. If you dont have a black dash this will be a little odd, mine is cream color, but it doesnt look terrible."
4,Very Good,It is just like ghost Recon but they through in a little covert ops. Its incredibly well done.
4,Very pleased,I was very pleased with the timely shipment of the product as well as the product itself.
5,Has one great Chapter other books don't have...,I bought this book specifically because it has a guide to diagnose plant problems. The leaves are turning yellow? That means something specific! There are holes in the leaves? That means something else entirely! Well worth the price if you're having problems growing healthy plants or are just starting out in the hobby.
3,For a plant tank not a fish tank,"I find the title containing the word encyclopedia a little deceiving. The back of the book describes the book a little better as ""Wide-ranging selection of the most common plants"". Though this book has many listings of aquarium plants I would not use this book to identify a plant because it is highly abridged. The advice on how to setup a planted tank is geared towards a plant only tank and would be atypical for a aquarium where the main focus is tropical fish. Maybe just me but I was looking for a book about having ornamental plants in my tropical fish tank. Still useful, Easy read, I would suggest this book to someone who doesn't know much about aquarium plants but wants to get a good foothold in the basics. Keep in mind that this book is about a plant tank not a fish tank."
3,WELL - IT IS MARSHALL CRENSHAW,"So, you like Mr. Crenshaw and you feel the need to own his recordings. You may as well add this but lower your expectations a bit. The MC that I know and love plays in a band. You know, guitars and drums. He's best with the basics. I'm not a fan of strings outside of an orchestra. The good songs here are very good and you'll eventually sing them but he ran out of gas. The first song is not a song but a meaningless intro that you'll skip for certain. There are 2 songs that sound like they came straight from the backwoods. There are 3 instrumentals and they are all solid (the best being ""You Said What?"" but there is the absence of his voice, which I always miss. Go ahead, go get it. But you'll go back and play ""Someday Someway"" and ""Cynical Girl"" more often."
4,"Not only hook-laden, but long on atmosphere!","Mr. Crenshaw takes a bit of a turn on this CD, with mucho atmospheric production created by use of strings, stand-up bass, bongos, etc., all used to back-up his still-solid and varied use of, yes, the guitar (electric and otherwise)...Definitely mature but still in love with rock n roll, the album gets happier as it progresses, and a few moody instrumenstals placed throughout make for nice change of paces...I don't know if this'll win any new converts (take a chance!), but any Crenshaw fans who strayed around the time Warners stopped considering him ""commercially viable"" should perhaps consider this the portal with which to reaquaint themselves with his catchy and plaintive world..."
1,Broke already?,"My first Micro-go-round lasted years, worked fine and enticed me to buy a second one. Wow, it lasted all of 6 months. It was not even worked hard. What happened that something so simple would break so soon. I thought of taking it apart, but better yet I'll just order a second one for the next 6 months. Any bets as to whether it will last that long?"
3,Plastic gears are the weak link.,"I don't know of another game in town. My over-the-range microwave is 18 years old and was not designed with a built-in turntable.I just bought my 3rd Micro-Go-Round in about 4 years. Whenever I can, I dissect failed devices to see what went wrong. The last 2 have failed in exactly the same place. There is a series of plastic gears that run a centrifugal brake that controls the rotating speed. Without the gears, the plate would spin uncontrolled - very quickly. One of the gears is designed to disengage the speed control (when rotated backwards) so that the plate can be wound faster than the brake would otherwise allow. The small, plastic gear teeth wear where it engages and disengages, causing it to bind up and the plate to stop.Oh well. They are cheaper than a new over-range microwave. Does anyone know of another aftermarket microwave turntable?"
2,Nordic Ware 10-inch micro go round,Constantly have to rewind. Sometimes it turns if the item is heavy enough otherwise it doesn't turn.
2,rotates too slowly for my taste,"I had forgotten you had to wind it up, but it works ok; I had just gotten spoiled when I visited my dad who had a micro with a build in turntable.It was great!"
5,Micro-go-round,"I purchased this to replace one that wore out after many years of use. I expect similar results from the new one. They are a great product, just don't use it when you use a bag of pop corn!"
1,Ordered two because of poor reviews,"Have an older microwave built-in which doesn't have a turntable. Had used the micro-go-round previously and had pretty good luck with it. However, one of the two is already not working very well. Can only turn it several times and then it goes no further, which is just a step above having no turntable at all. Have a second in reserve and am hopeful that it might work better than this one."
2,disappointed,"Looked new in the box, but hardly works at all... I am stilltrying to make do with the old one until I find another local one that I can try before I buy it..."
1,Double jeopardy!,"Ordered product and out of the box it did not work (wouldn't wind up). Requested a return from Amazon and they send a second unit.. same problem. Two different units... neither worked. We will not be ordering a third one! On the bright side, Amazon stood behind their return policy."
5,A Must Have,This is our second Micro-Go-Round. The first lasted a decade. It's a must have if your microwave oven does not have a built-in turn-table. Eliminates the need to manually rotate your food items.
3,Question,"I just bought a Micro Go Round, so it's premature for me to write a valid review. But, I noticed a reviewer indicated in a review several months ago that it shouldn't be used for microwave popcorn. (Guess why I bought the Micro Go Round?) Does anyone know why?"
3,Micro-Go-Round,"It work okay, it is not smooth when it is turning, it hopsand you have to rewind often. It does what it is suppose to do, but if youuse your microwave a lot, it gets annoying to have to rewind all the time."
3,Not as fast as a built-in turntable,"The turntable works as advertised. It winds up, you click it down with the plate, and it goes around and around - no problem at all. We were trying to wait to buy a replacement microwave after our turntable broke by using the micro-go-round. However, we found that is was MUCH slower than the original turntable and it did not cook the food nearly as fast or completely so we returned it and replaced our microwave."
1,DOES NOT LAST!,"As many have commented, they got this as a replacement for their previous micro-round that they got years of service from, but this time, it does not last. From the get-go mine would occasionally stop turning for a second or two, then start again. No biggie. But, as time went on, it stopped for longer and longer periods, or would work for a minute or two then just stop. I got about 2 months of acceptable performance from it. it was also not very sensitive to lighter weight items, like a half full coffee cup in comparison to say, a full dinner plate. I also agree that the price is too high. But, as others have noted, there doesn't seem to be any other alternatives available. From the reviews it seemed to be a 60% chance of getting one that works well, so i took a shot- but unfortunately came up short."
2,Not Impressed,"I guess it is OK. This one is heavier than the one I broke several years ago and goes around very slowly. You have to make sure the item being cooked is heavy enough to acitivate it or put it on a plate for the unit to work. It is pressure sensitive. I probably would not have bought it, if I had looked/tried it in a store."
1,Failed after only a few months!,We had our first Micro-go-Round for more than 15 years and it worked great. We had to replace it when the wind-up motor finally gave up the ghost last year. The replacement lasted about 9 months before it failed. I could not find any warranty information from the manufacturer and it was too late to return to Amazon.
2,????,"has a jeking motion as it turns,is noisy too. I wouldn't buy again. but it was less expensive than a new microwave."
1,Waste of money,Barely turns as winding device is ineffective. My recently purchased microwave/confection oven did not have a factory installed carousel. Thought the Micro-Go-Round would be useful. It was not.
1,problems with the plate,the plate fits in my small microwave but i put 5 pounds of food on it wound it and it does not twist.i am rather disappointed. there is no avenue for return.
1,newer ones poorer quality,"I had a Micro-go-round for many (10+) years and was very happy with it. When it finally died, I bought another (after gasping a bit at the price increase!). I was VERY disappointed that the new one does not seem to be as well built. It never worked quite as smoothly and now (just after warranty expired) rarely works at all. I am not willing to shell out for another given that the quality seems poor."
3,Not Nordic,"My Micro-go-round just broke after 25 years of daily use. However, I notice that the name is ""Premiere"" not Nordic. It looks like the original company was sold to Nordic. I am going to buy the Nordic and hope that I don't get a bad one. If so, it will go right back for credit. I'm giving it three stars to start, if it works I'll correct my rating."
2,Microwave Turntable,"This item really doesn't work that well. Whatever you place on top tends to shift position or slip off which causes the turntable stop. This makes it necessary to stop the cooking process, open the microwave, re-adjust, and start it up again. Therefore, you have to keep a constant eye on things. The other thing is, the turntable turns so slowly that at first I thought it wasn't working. I finally realized that it was working, but that it turned at a snail's pace. Overall, I am not at all thrilled with this purchase."
2,Better than nothing,"We purchased the micro-go-round because the house we rent has a older built-in microwave without a turntable. This product works, but I was disappointed in the quality for the price."
1,Could this be refurbished?,"Recycled original box or I WOULD be returning. Item is stained when you look in bright light. Could be glue or possibly refurbished. Other than that, micro-go-round does not seem to spin very well. Lesson learned."
3,Disappointed - not happy!,I thought I was ordering a new item. The one shipped appeared to be used and/or refurbished. For this I should not be charged full price.
2,Works for a little while and breaks...,"This product is great in theory, but I've now owned 3 of them and none have lasted more than 6 mths. I don't have kids and I am careful with it. I dont submerge it in water and I didn't overwind it. Still--all 3 at $35.00/ea, have lasted maybe 6 months apiece. I kept buying them to acccomodate for a broken microwave turntable, but after spending more than $100, I have come to the conclusion that its just not worth putting off a new microwave anymore with these things. I would not recommend this product."
2,Yuk!!!,This product was way below what I expected for the money. It does not last 5 minutes going around while cooking. I really should return it but I need something in my microwave.
1,The previous warnings should have been enough.,"I moved into a place which had a built-in under-the-counter microwave made in the pre-carousel era. It would have required a jackhammer to remove it from its anchor. Despite reading some of the cautionary reviews, I bought the carousel anyway, as I naturally assumed the other people were simply too hamfisted. It worked fine for about a week. Then it simply stopped after it was fully wound one day. I did not use excessive force in winding as the written directions warned against. The only excessive force was when I frisbeed it into the waste basket!"
4,Great item,"Turntable works wonderfully. I'm amazed that the only place I could find it was here. I checked Walmert, Target, and other stores and no one carried it."
1,A piece of trash,"Used this turntable just once before it broke. You should heed the warning of other reviewers. (Wish I had.) It's almost impossible not to ""overwind"" this thing and break it, no matter how careful you are. It went straight to the garbage, where it belonged all along."
1,3rd time is not the charm!,"This is the third purchase of this product. The first two we have had over the past fifteen years have worked just fine but they do wear out. This time, it is difficult for the plate to start and continue its circular motion. It is like the plate is not heavy enough suggesting that the springs or something are not adjusted correctly. Even if I get it to start turning, it will stop. It needs to be returned. I do want to try another one as we have always been pleased in the past."
1,Junk,Broke in a few weeks - don't waste your money - I finally found a replacement glass tray that was less expensive.
4,Good Turntable Overall,"This is a good product for microwaves that don't have a built in turntable. Just flip it upside down, wind it up, and flip it back over to use. The only problem is that lighter items do not have the weight needed to make it spin (it is weight activated). Most food products and containers are heavy enough to make it work, but things like the smaller serving popcorn bags are too light. I also thought the price was a bit high...if you are willing to spend a bit more you can just buy a new microwave (the small ones have gotten quite affordable)."
3,necessary gadget,These turntables are a necessity when your microwave is not equipped with one to keep your food rotating. They work fine until they don't. This is our third. Amazon had the best price.
3,"It's ok, but not spectacular",I have an older microwave that works great but doesn't have a built in turntable so for it's purpose this product is a great addition!I'd have given it 5 stars if it lasted longer -- I generally get about 2 years out of these. I've probably bought 3 or 4 of these over the years. I should have just bought a new microwave with a built in turntable from the get go... I sent one back for warranty repair once but I never did get it back from the company..
1,Unhappy with Product,"I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase. It was damaged in shipment or before shipment and does not work. I have previously submitted my disappointment and thought I would get a response from Amazon or the shipper but to date NO RESPONSE at all! So, I am filing a dispute with my credit card company. I now will be very hesitant buying anything online with Amazon."
1,not pleased,"I have only had the microwave-go-round for about 2 weeks, but I am already dissatisfied with its performance. Its rotation is sporadic at best. If I put a small casserole dish with 2 cups of water in it to make rice, it won't turn. It just barely turns when reheating a 1 cup beverage. I was hoping that, with the micro-go-round, I wouldn't have to go out and buy a new microwave when my turntable gave out, but it looks as though I just wasted my money, and will have to go ahead with my purchase."
3,NordicWare 10-Inch Micro-Go-Round,"The unit works just fine, but one needs to be very gentle winding it. This is my 4th one. They break very easily. The inner parts are made of easily breakable plastic. They are the only product like them on the market and have no competition, that is why they continue to make it so poorly and still make sales."
2,There has to be something better out there...,"We bought this a year ago after our microwave's built-in turntable system quit, despite several negative reviews. Even from day 1, this thing spun way too slowly and seemed way too high maintenance. Worried about someone over-winding it, and just not that impressed with it, I considered returning it but didn't because we needed SOMETHING. Several months ago, my oldest moved out and I gave him the microwave (and this turntable). He says the spinning speed got even slower over time, and then the feature that senses weight stopped working last month. In other words, when he takes the plate or bowl off the turntable it keeps spinning. No way to stop it spinning except let it run itself to the end of that winding. Now, he says it doesn't work at all.I just logged on hoping to find something different or better, but this still seems to be the only option here. I'd almost rather replace the microwave than spend another $30 on this."
3,Handle carefully!,"This is the second Go-round that I have purchased. I bought this second one because I couldn't find another product on the market that would do the same job (in a microwave with no built-in turntable.)It must be wound carefully upside down on a level surface,and not too tight so as not to break the spring. Then turned over and set gently in the microwave.The product was packaged adequately in shipping and arrived in good condition."
4,DJ Chef Spins the Food,"This turntable works like a charm in my microwave. The minuses are that it uses a spring/coil mechanism, so you have to rewind it when it uncoils all of the way. And secondly, there is not an indicator to let you know how much tension is left in the spring. With that feature, you could easily tell if it needed to be wound up before you started cooking."
5,Highest Quality,"Our original Micro Go Round finally gave up the ghost after twenty years of use. We were happy to find the product still available for purchase, and there have been significant improvements in design and functionality. We have no reason at this point to think that we won't have the ""new and improved"" model for another couple of decades."
1,Microwave turntable,"I wouldn't buy this thing again ever. You have to have a heavy item to put on it to make it turn around. When you wind it, it makes a terrible noise and you have to wind it every time you use. Don't waste your money."
5,Micro-Go-Round,This item was bought for my daughter who absolutely loves it. It works the way it says it does. Easy to use.
1,Doesn't replace the convenience of built-in turntable,"Even though this product functions as advertised, it's not as convenient as a built-in microwave turntable and many of the things I have cooked on it didn't cook evenly. You can't tell when it's wound up enough, so if you have to cook something for 10 minutes or so, it usually stops. The biggest problem I had was cooking popcorn. I couldn't find any way of cooking it without it either burning, not cooking, or the bag bursting because you have to put it on a heavier plate, pushing down the turntable didn't work. I wouldn't buy another one, but it's helped until I can get my microwave replaced."
5,Micro-Go-Round,"Great, inexpensive alternative for a microwave whose turntable motor recently burned out! It was cheaper than replacing the motor! I would buy this item again, if necessary."
5,Fine Microwave Accessory,"Our 30+year old Amana ""RadarRange"" microwave still works, and this spring-driven rotator modernizes it! Excellent performance. But do not overwind it! (NordicWare ""Micro-go-Round"" purchased from Amazon"")"
4,Micro Go Round,"This winds up in order to use, and I have been fairly favorably pleased with this item. It's a lot cheaper than replacing the entire microwave or replace the installed turntable in my microwave."
3,my experience w/go around,"I bought this item on Nov. 2010 and by Sept. 2012 was out of order, stop working, even I used only once or twice a week."
3,"glad i got it, but needs improvement (faster turn)","the turntable is SLOW SLOW SLOW! wish it moved faster like a normal built in turntable in a microwave. Also i think since it takes up space in the 'wave, that everything takes a little bit longer to cook now.but it's better than not having the dish turn at all and better than having to buy a new microwave that includes the built in ones."
1,Micro go round,"Product is too difficult to wind up. I found it to be very, very, very, very very very, very disappointing."
5,My Happiness with the Microwave Micro-go-around,"I was very happy to find I could purchase the Microwave Micro Go-Round through Amazon. My microwave is over 20 years old and in good working condition. The only thing it needed was a new Micro-Go-Round. I could not purchase one locally since all the new microwaves come with a turntable. I didn't want to get rid of my microwave, so I decided to go on line to see if they were still being made. Much to my surprise, I found one on Amazon. Now I am totally happy. Thanks, Amazon."
1,MicroRound,"I bought this item because I moved into a house with a microwave that did not have a turn table built in. This turntable has to be wound after every use, even if just for a few seconds. I am not happy with the product."
3,Slight problem.,I have owned one of these turntables previously and had no problems with it. This one will not stop turning when the food is removed. You have to lift the turntable up by the top and wait for it to stop turning and then gingerly set the turntable down or it will start again. This may be a defective turntable because I do not remember having to do that with the original one I purchased.
3,Only Okay,"I have an older microwave item and needed something that rotated. Years ago I had a wind up turntable and it was wonderful but eventually died. While this product does the job it is cheaply made and somewhat flimsy, but it does do the job it was purchased to do. The packaging upon arrival was poor at best, almost no protection inside the outer shipping box"
1,Bummer,"The item itself i am sure works fine, but when I got it it was broken. So now I have to order another one. Bummer!!!"
3,over priced but does the job,"We purchased this turn table because the table in our microwave oven stopped working. This unit does not work well with light objects, like bags of popcorn. It works fine for reheating items on a heavy plate. I think the $30.00 price tag was excessive though this was the only unit I could find."
2,Nordic Ware MIcrowave Micro-Go-Round 10 Inch,I have had a few of these. they work fine for about a year then they stop working. they either stop working because if you wind the unit up to the end it can break the unit. also it just sometimes just stops working. The unit needs to be redesigned with a stop so you cannot wind it too much and better quality made inside.Also I feel it costs too much money for what your getting.
4,Only real choice on the market,"I had this exact item, but it had worn out and wouldn't stay wound. I was hoping to find a competetive item on the market that might work better, but was unable to. In the end, I had to agree with many of the reviews I was seeing that pointed out that it worked fine for the money. I realized that my old one had probably lasted over 10 years before it started wearing out, which is really pretty good based on the relatively small amount that I paid for it."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Use our microwave for daily living. Nothing major in time blocks, but several uses per day. This unit failed to operate after 1 and 1 / 2 weeks use. DISAPPOINTING and a bit overpriced to start with ."
1,"Beware buying ""new"" Micro-go-round","I bought what was described as a new Micro-go-round on Amazon in December 2011. It has never worked really well and has finally broken. I opened it up using directions from another reviewer and was amazed to see how worn the interior of the device is - scuffs, gouges, fragments of plastic all over the place, and the date appearing on the metal base of the top interior is Feb 2010, a full 20 months before I bought the thing. Can you spell ""reconditioned""? I am very disappointed in this item from Amazon. It's my 3rd Micro-go-round in probably 30 years and has lasted just over a year. Since I didn't buy it from Nordicware I doubt I'm covered by any warranty."
1,DOESN'T WORK,THIS THING THAT WE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. IT DOESN'T MOVE AROUND (OR AT LEAST YOU CAN'T SEE IT MOVING...
3,Manual motor like a music box,"You wind it up like a toy by turning the turntable and it turns until it winds down, then you have to turn it to wind it again. The turn doesn't last long but it's not really that time consuming to do it. It still better than no turn at all."
2,Not Even A New One!,"This was not comparable to the usual quality of products that I order from Amazon! It was all beat up around the edges and looked as if it was a ""used one"" which I would never have orderded!"
2,Works but breaks easily,"My experience was not as good as the other reviewer. This is a very handy thing to have if you don't have a microwave with a built-in turntable. It works well, but it is a bit slow and makes a loud noise as it's spinning. Also, some things are just too light to make it turn. To combat this, I put lightweight items on a heavy plate. The downside is that it breaks very easily if you overwind it. And there's no real gauge for winding, no apparent stopping point. I usually tried to underwind it on purpose. But I guess I wound it a half a spin to far one day and there's no way to fix it. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a better alternative short of buying a microwave with a turntable. So in summary:Pros: Works well when it works. Heats food evenlyCons: Breaks easily; Light weights won't make is spin"
1,Avoid Nordic Ware 10-inch Micro-Go-Round,"Junk! The plastic shaft which connects the entire turntable to the wind-up spring motor is only about 1/4 inch in diameter. You crank up the turntable to the limit of the spring, and suddenly the shaft has to absorb all the angular torque of the turntable. When are you getting close to the limit of the spring? There is no way to tell. Bang, the shaft breaks. Another problem? The heat of the food warps the turntable over time. The warping disables the ability of the table to sense the weight of the food and start the table turning. Look for alternatives. Save the outrageous $30-$40 and buy a new microwave with a turntable built in."
2,"A better, longer lasting product is needed","It is incomprehensible that there is no viable competition for this long needed product. Older microwaves did not automatically include rotating bases. This product, by not having any competition, persists while totally ignoring its limited, minimal lifetime and persistent need for replacement.By now it should have been redesigned with more efficient and longer lasting elements. It is shameful that Nordic refuses to acknowledge the problems and chooses to arrogantly ignore the issues raised by disappointed users. They have to be aware of the problems, but seemingly prefer to ignor one and all. Yes, it works and does the job, for a while-- how long? Who knows? Luck plays a big factor."
5,Excellent product,"The Nordic Ware 10-Inch Micro-Go-Round turntable is the ideal solution when you do not want to discard a perfectly good microwave just because it does not have a built-in turntable. It is easy to use, and I recommend it highly."
5,NordicWare 10-Inch Micro-Go-Round,My first one finally gave up after I can't remember how many years of use. Couldn't use the micro without one!!
1,Nordic Merry- Go- Round,"AWFUL !! It has already broken - seems to be a major design flaw. We had the older style (same look, slightly different internal mechanism) for over 20 years !!We had just begin to use it, and started encountering difficulties until it stopped working altogether.VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!!!!!"
3,Even the Merry-Go-Round gets old,"I had one of these for years and it finally got dropped and broke. The replacement is ""cranky'"" hard to wind and -- because of the auto start mechanism -- always needs a little help in getting started. I am sure that over time it'll loosen up but it ought to work right out of the box."
2,Junk,My mother won't let me buy her a new microwave. She had one of these for years but dropped it and it exploded apart. She purchased a new one and it stopped turning after a year. I bought her yet another one and had to return it because it didn't turn correctly. So I got her another one and so far so good. It's been a month. Hallelujah!! For all the trouble she could have a nice new microwave for a little more than the cost of the Merry Go Round. On a good note - she's had the microwave since the early eighties.
1,ZERO!!,The turntable has NEVER turned! I only checked one-star because there was no place to record a minus!
2,Just Doesn't Last,"Purchased a second after the first malfunctioned. The second lasted even shorter than the first. These are too easy to overwind and the item simply stops working and bingo--its dead. If you plan to purchase this item, wind it very slowly and only briefly. Then perhaps it will work. We have decided its more advantageous to simply purchase a new microwave."
4,Replacement for one bought in 1989,"I just opened the box of the new turntable and was glad to see that it looks very similar to the old one, which wore out after about 24 years of use. We took the old one apart and found that plastic had been distorted by heat and was impeding the rotation. As a result, we plan to not use the new one when cooking bacon or making popcorn because those are the two things that take longest and create the most heat. I would give the old turntable 5 stars for having lasted so long and worked so well. I'm giving this one 4 stars in advance with hope that it will be as satisfactory."
3,Micro-Go-Round,"The first one was defective immediately - it would not turn - winding mechanism was broke. After contacting Amazon, they referred me to the distributor and a new one was sent out without needing to return broken one. Doesn't have the capacity to turn very long and re-winding is constantly necessary."
2,Didn't like it,"Winding feature was intermittant and didn't last long enough. Also, the thickness of the item itself seemed to interfere with heating/cooking results. Good idea but wasn't worth the effort."
1,Arrived Defective,"I was replacing my 22+ year old Nordic Ware Microwave Micro-Go-Round that finally gave out. I was surprised that it was still on the market. When I received my replacement through Amazon, I found it would only spins for a few seconds no matter how much it was wind up. It was noticably lighter in weight than my original. I guess cheaper lighter materials have since been used. I have repurchased from another online store for fear if I reordered, I might get the same defective one I returned based on a past experience of a different item."
5,Great Item,Great item for older microwaves. Would recommend for any use that needs to rotate. Weight sensitivity is also another great feature
1,Poor product,I had one of these for 30 thirty years. Different style and it actually worked.The new and improved DOES NOT WORK! Much to weak to turn around. It hasto be pushed to get it started. Very seldom will it go around five times withoutit being rewound. Most of the time it won't complete turning for one plate of food.One star it to much for the new and improved model of Micro-Go-Round
3,Turntable OK,"Product is not quite as convenient and easy to use as the modern automatic turntables in the newer ovens, but it works as well as those early day inventions. Although generally a bit pricey, this price was better than I found elsewhere. It will do in a pinch and was probably less expensive than having the oven repaired or replaced."
1,Bad item,This thing does not work very well. It is poorly engineered so that items tip it and it barely revolves. Also you have to prop it on its tangent to keep it from running due to its own weight when not in use. Where are the original ones that had a spring and lever to make it unwind??
1,doesn't work,"this did not work...you have to wind it first, and it says to not over wind, but you have no way of knowing if you are over winding because you could wind this thing forever! it only works (goes around) if you have something heavy on it, so you can't reheat something light or it won't even go around, so you have to put the item on a heavier plate just to get this to go around....then it just stops, or is very very slow....not worth the money, did not work, I returned it!"
2,Micro-Go- Round,The one that was sent to me did not work. I sent it back and hope I get a new one very soon.
2,This is the second one I bought and now it's broke!,"This is the second one I bought and now it's broke! Apparently, these are not made to hold up to temperatures of the microwave. First the top cracks then the parts rust and it $34 worth of junk in your trash."
4,Micro-Go-Round,This Microwave Micro-Go-Round was a replacement for a Micro-Go-Round I had used for several years. I am equally as pleased with it as I was with the one it replaced.
3,Not to bad,"I needed one of these because the house I just moved into, has a microwave above the range. but didn't have a turntable in it making it difficult to heat food properly, so I ordered the turntable and it does do its job just turns much slower than microwaves that already has one built in. You have to manually wind it up every time toy use it. I am glad they make them!"
1,RETURNED,I WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS SINCE THE TURN TABLE IN MY MICROWAVE HAD GIVENOUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. I RECEIVED IT TODAY AND IT WAS DIRTY AND WOULD NOTWORK - EVEN A LITTLE. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED AND STARTED TO REORDER THEN READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND DECIDED I WOULD BE BETTER OFF TO SPEND THATREFUND TOWARDS A NEW MICROWAVE. I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I ORDERED.
4,microwave turntable,"Love this turntable. Have an old but great microwave and had a turntable like this for almost 20 years, so bought it again."
5,another winner,"If you loved Brightly Blackhearted, then add this to your collection. It is another solid entry in female-fronted goth/metal with not one bad track on it. My only problem is that, at 25 minutes, it is too short, though I've listened to it dozens of times and am still not tired of it."
3,"Louder than console, but not quite there yet","The siren is rated at about 110dB however when it's blocked by an object the sound level drops significantly. I tried to place the siren to face the vent but the result is muffed alarm and you can barely hear it from another room.After some googling I found some FAQ saying that this unit can be modified to act as a relay switch to turn on siren of your choice, so I got a 12VDC 30watt dual-tone siren and some components ready, ideally I can install this weather-proof horn outdoor and it'll attract neighbor's attention. We'll see how it goes."
2,"Need to add to the chorus of ""meh"" on this item...","110db? Not a chance. If you're standing more than a few feet away you can listen to this noise comfortably without earplugs--and I have VERY sensitive ears. And if ANYTHING is in front of this item (if you have it in a cabinet or case or something) you'll barely hear it.Also, I found it really picky on which outlets it would work out of. I definitely couldn't run it from any extension cord or surge protector, and it will only work directly plugged into about half the outlets in my house.There aren't many options for X10/GE Simon systems though, so I am still using these and looking for something better in the meantime.Do yourself a favor and buy them in quantity (2 or 3) from X10 direct though and save yourself some money. These things are ridiculously priced individually."
1,"Agree with others, these just suck. I can scream louder!","These are ""Poor Horns,"" not power horns. They might startle a sleeping baby with it's head butted up against it, otherwise, they're a joke. Also, after about six months and having never been actually triggered, only tested, they stopped working. Expensive, worthless white boxes. Find something other than X10. Just not a real alarm. A toy at best."
2,Others Like It,"I've had TR-12 for over 15 years, more or less, and it is a pain most of the time. Heavy, awkward, and not well thought out. The cord is continuously in the way. Changing bits is a pain, what with two clunky wrenches. The documentation is a direct translation that is sparse, poorly written, and painfully quick to read. I have no idea what the template guide does. I cannot attach bushings to it, while there is very little support from Hitachi in any manner. The scale fell off, the column are as sticky as can be so there is no ""return"" left and the body simply ""stays"" down. I have taken it in twice to have it worked on. Am ready to go and chuck it from time to time, but...... After reading the other guys words, I must have gotten the first one off the line and later they worked the bugs out!?! But when it does work, 3 HP is a lot muscle!"
4,Good story,"This story is re-printed and changed in 11/2009 under Luke: Armed and Dangerous. Names are changed and certain scenes, but the story is the same. It still a good story and very enjoyable."
5,A Major Advance for Stellar Bassist,"Everything seems to have come together for Patitucci on Communion--he's assembled some of the finest jazz musicians on the scene today and they all play marvelously, he's written some beautiful songs across a wide musical spectrum, he employs a tasty palatte of textures and colorations, and there's a joi de vivre about the playing.Always having something interesting to say as a musician, but hampered by weak spots or not quite the right presentation in his previous recordings, Patitucci has put that all behind and come up with a stunning record. Alternating between acoustic, electric, and piccolo bass, Patitucci proves himself the master of each, precisely evoking the exact right sensibiblity from each instrument.It strikes me that this record could appeal to a wide specrtum of jazz fans. It's accessible enough for the smooth crowd and rigorous enough for the hardcore acoustic believers. No matter what camp you find yourself in, it's worth checking out."
3,A Bit too Avant-Garde For Me,"Patitucci is an amazing bassist, he have great technique and definently have ""something to say"". However, 'Communion' is a little too avant-garde for me. Patitucci and his (great) band are playing with the rythems, the melodies and the harmonies in a way that is not unpleasent, yet needs to get used to. If you like Avant-Garde jazz, you'll like this CD, but it is a bit too much for me."
4,"American Patriotism is not dead! Remember September 11, 2001","I applaud the many radio-stations that have created montages using this and other patriotic compositions as well as radio stations of ALL FORMATS; Rock, Rap, Pop, Blues, Jazz, not just country stations which are playing Mr Greenwoods song, ""God Bless the USA"", in it's entirety. This song could hardly be considered ""trite"" (as one previous reviewer so sadly remarked) and this emotion in Lee Greenwoods performance of this song in particular brings a tear to many American's eyes, especially in the light of the recent traqedy.Thank you Lee Greenwood, for creating a TIMELESS song about American Patriotism that we can all understand and identify with. Thank you for writing a song that has helped bring many Americans TOGETHER in demonstrating the PRIDE, Dedication and Resilience of the people of the USA.Today we are all AMERICANS..."
5,It's a Great CD!,"Lee Greenwood's compact disc God Bless The U.S.A. is wonderful, the best song is God Bless The U.S.A. it has always been a powerful and moving song ever since he recorded it during the Gulf War but now with what happened on 9-11-01 it is even more powerful and meaningful!"
4,Hits home at this time.,"I am curious as to how ""music fan from North Carolina"" feels about this song now since his/her review was done in May 2001.This song has always brought a tear to my eye, even more so now then before"
1,Cliches galore,"If you like your patriotism trite, unoriginal and served up with cliches galore than the title track of this CD is for you. If however, you are offended by the notion that a noble virtue such as love of one's country can be reduced to simplistic nationalism and marketed as a product to make money then avoid this cringe worthy and hackneyed tune like the plague."
1,Cheddar cheese hokum.,"I love my country and support our current military action, but let's come to our senses:This musik is a mix of velveeta and saccharine, successfully marketed to the gun-totin', Wal-Mart-goin', Roseanne-lovin' lowbrow masses numbly ensconsed between our coasts.When there has been any U.S. military action since the Gulf War, aside from fearing loss of life, I fear the return of this alleged song, which I know will be offered up ad nauseum across our media outlets. Stop the madness..."
2,Repetitive,Pros:- Fancy Matrix-style moves.- The game is severely discounted.- Voice talent is from the TV series.- Frequent save games.- Simple controls to pull off a variety of moves.Cons:- Very very repetitive.- Uninteresting storyline between sequences.- Pulling off the fancy moves doesn't really get you much new.- AI is poor. Far too easy to stealtily take down the enemy.- Game world is far too constraining. There is far too little to do.- When fighting the boss you lose the ability to use your weapons and health packs.
3,It Could Have Been Better,"Dark Angel is one of the first PS2 that I have owned. It is based on the short lived, but wonderful TV show. The game can be fun, but boring at times. There are a few glitches and the graphics are not the best."
3,More of a rental...,"It took me about three days to beat this game, so I classify it as short. The story isn't that great and has hardly anything to do with the show. The camera angle is annoying sometimes, but R3 can be used for that. The game does not allow very much freedom, and there's not a lot of strategy. The graphics are good. This and the action and moves are probably the best things about this game. If you feel you need to play it, rent it because if you buy it it will just lay around gathering dust."
4,"Yeah, Jessica Alba yeah!","I like this game, I first purchased this back in 07 and the game broke so I was without it for a while but recently purchased it again. I wish the graphics were better and she had more fighting combo's but it's a fun game to play."
4,X5 452,This covert operation is set out to help and defend max's friends whom she meets along the way.In the attempt to uncover and escape from I-corporation she comes along some enemies she wished were in the past.If you want to be good at the game then you should know about the manticore project and what it means. Help Max and Logan through the police patrolling streets of her home town.
1,What the heck?!,"I bought this game because I like martial arts....period. This game got boring after 4 levels. You have to carry certain weapons from one space to another, and use them later in the other levels OR YOU CANNOT PASS!! The graphics are okay, and the moves were aweseome....too bad you get them all at the beggining and you don't get anything new. It's get old fast, and to add to the insult, it's basic: Point A, Point B. Done. Oh, and you can sneak around too. I wish I bought this when it was this inexpensive, or maybe not at all."
4,This Game Doesn't Live Up To Any Of It's Expectations,"Don't Judge A Game By It's Cover.This Game Impressed Me For Like 3 Minutes When I Started Playing It And I Passed Levels Fast But Then It Started Getting Boring And Matrix Styles Is Gettin Old, Enter The Matrix Is Better Than This I Even Give IT (Enter The Matrix) 5 STARZ. This Game Is Crappy And I Realized That I Wasted A Perfect Good Solid Ten Buckz Of Buying This Piece Of Crap Instead Of Going To A Movie, So I Traded This For Downhill Domination.(Always If You're Going To Buy A Game That Just Came Out- Ask Somebody That Played It, See The Reviews On The Internet, Or A Game Magazine.Learn From UR Mistakez People!.)"
2,warning: Fenix does not stand behind their product,"FYI: Originally, I gave this model 5 stars for its powerful beam. Then, the shine came off the relationship as the switch started to fail and the beam started flickering between ""low"" and ""high"" modes, a common point of failure on flashlights. That is what warranties are for, yes? Ah, but here's the problem. When I contacted the manufacturer for warranty service, they said they were very sorry but that I would need to send it back to the reseller rather than handle it themselves. Just thought you prospective buyers would like to know. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to deduct four stars from my inaccurate initial review. Try Gerber for a company with comparable products and a reputation for treating their customers better."
4,Luxeon surpassed by Cree,"Four stars only because this Luxeon model is not as bright as the newer Cree model.Get this instead:Fenix L2D-CE (Cree Edition LED) Digital LED Flashlight (6 Output levels) - 135 Lumens uses 2x AA batteriesMuch brighter. Adds strobe, SOS, additional output levels. Better battery life too."
4,re-evaluating my previous review,"Seller acknowledged error and without asking, gave me a full refund on product, even though I had not asked for any."
1,Rip off,"I ordered this product expecting a BOOK to arrive, not a workbook style book. It has some great ideas, but I paid more than the MSRP of $3.99 for it and am very dissatisfied, especially since to return it for a refund will cost me $3.99."
5,One of my favorite CD's,"I bought this CD several months ago, and it has become one of my favorites. It has a wide variety of music, all played with musicality, style, and a great sense of fun. Overall, a perfect CD to listen to with shoes off, feet up, and a cup of Starbucks in hand."
3,WAZZUP WITH THE FREEZIN'?,"First of all, this game is very enjoying. Find The Flying Dutchman's treasures and interact with Patrick, Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs and more. Catch jellyfish and spell SPONGEBOB by finding the letters. But, if your game starts freezing every time you enter a new area, welcome to the party. I can't make it out of the first area because the game freezes and quits on me. But, after reading other reviews of this game, it seems that some people don't have freezy games. My other Rugrats game that I rented froze too. So, fun game but warning."
4,Save SpongeBob,"Got this game for my son for Christmas. He was disappointed with the game at first because, as others have said, it kept restarting from the beginning. But he kept on playing until he realized that the only way to get through it is to save, save, save! He now saves after he reaches each level and has had no problems with it. He's now playing and enjoying it every day."
1,Dont bother!,"Ours has the glitch that puts you back to the start, as do so many others. What a waste!"
5,Zemsta Latajcy Holender!!!,"Ta gra uczy wszyscy troch o ¬øyciu. Robi mi serce dobre, aby uzyska grze SpongeBob wic mog patrze na okadk przez cay dzie√±"
2,"fun, but big loading issues","I got this for my girls years ago and they loved it, one BIG problem, when you go from one section to the next, the game won't load. My girls learned early on that before they went on to another section they had to save the game. I called the company and they said that it was some sort of compatibility problem with this game and the newer ps2(remember this was years ago). So basically they said they would refund my money if I wanted to send the game back, but my girls just learned to deal with it. There was nothing else the company could do because it was a problem with the game, not just the disk."
3,glitch,Um i personally think its a great game but i bought this game at least 3 times because every game i got for the play station 2 there was a terrible loading glitch and i was just wondering if this has happened to anyone else?
4,Revenge of the Flying Dutchman,"Another fun game in the Spongebob stable. If you like the tv series, you'll enjoy this game."
2,not as good as the second one,"apparrently technology has gotten better. dont waste your money on this game. buy the second one. i have so much fun playing the second one and i dont bother with this one anymore. the gaphics are pitiful as well as how different the levels are from one another. nice try nick, but atleast you improved, alot!!! once again...buy the second one...a much better investment"
2,Bad Background,"Don't get me wrong, this game is challenging, but it's boring. The places you play in are just the normal places you see in the TV show. One thing that's new is that you don't always battle a flying Dutchman in the TV show, but other than that I don't really like it."
3,The Glitch,"Sorry to disappoint you but I agree there is a huge glitch in the program. I've replaced the disk and still have the glitch. When you're playing the game, if you move from one area to another the game freezes, & kicks you out to start over from the beginning. The only way around this is to save the game often so you can a least go back to where you were whe you got kicked out."
5,spongebob is the best game,"well, spongebob revenge of the flying dutchman is the best game in history. going around bakiney bottom and otherplaces is fun. you can talk to people like patrick,Mr,krabs,squidward,sandy,ect.when you go agenst the flying dutchman, it is very hard. so if you bye it, it is worth your money.good luck!!"
1,Major software bug in this game.. beware,"My 8 yr old daughter got PS2 and this game for Christmas from Santa. When the program loads to go into different sections of the game, it frequently ( at least once per 10 minute usage ) cannot read the disk and throws you out to a cannot read disk scenario where u need to start over. For an adult it is very frustrating, for an 8 year old it breaks their heart. I've even returned the game to get a new disk ( same thing ) and ran the disk on my neighbor's PS2... same problem.I would stay way from this game unless you are willing to put up with this. Saving does help but there are some higher level areas of the game that we have never been able to launch into without the game blowing up as described above. Too bad... nice looking game but they went production with this before a full test evidentally. Rent this game before taking the plunge in purchasing it to see what the reviewers mean by this glitch."
2,The GLICTH ruins this game,"Add me to the list of people who have the reset problem - the PS2 resets almost every time I change levels. I went to the THQ website, and was surprised to see NO information about this at all under the support section for this game. Have other people sent email to the THQ support group about this? I suggested that they come read the reviews here at Amazon, so they don't think I'm the only one having this problem."
1,This game would've been great... BUT....,"Unfortunately, the disk I bought has the infamous glitch. I'm going to return it and not bother buying another, since many people have said they had this problem even after buying a new disk.At first I played the game without saving, just attempting to look around, and I kept getting kicked out of the game to a screen informing me that my PS2 couldn't read the disk. I tried again and discovered that saving very often helps, and will allow you to play for a longer amount of time without trouble.Despite the inconveniences I wanted to keep the game and continue play. But, when I got to the part where I have to find a bus ticket to Chum World the Glitch brought me to a sudden halt. No matter where I go now, as soon as the game switches screens and has to load another, it resets.Major disappointment, I'll be glad to get my money back."
2,Let Down,I like the show. But the game is boring because all you do is walk around Bikini Bottom to look for gold coins.
2,Big Glitch!,"As with the other reviewer, this has a BIGTIME glitch that it stops playing after the first level of finding all the letters to SPONGEBOB's name. At first i thought i didnt have enough memory on the PS2 memory card, but I did and it was not the memory cards fault. I have returned the PS2 game and hope the next one will be fixed, if not my kids will be disappointed. They LOVED the way it was played but kept getting mad when the game stopeed"
3,"Not as good as ""Skipped Parts""","Having loved ""Skipped Parts"", I couldn't wait to read ""Sorrow Floats"". While I enjoyed the sequel, I don't think it's as good as I expected it to be. Possibly my expectations were just too high. But I don't think Sandlin's creation of Maurey's inner voice is nearly as good as that of Sam Callahan. It is always difficult for a man to write from a woman's point of view, and vice versa. Something about Maurey just didn't ring true to me. I know that's a vague complaint and I wish I could explain it more precisely. Regardless, it is a fun and easy read, and I will move onto the 3rd book in the trilogy."
1,worst book in the trilogy,"I am surprised at the number of positive reviews. I really enjoyed Skipped Parts and thought Social Blunders was interesting and entertaining, but this book was such a waste of time. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. It was filled with self-pity. What happened to this girl who had so much potential? Geez! It was boring and overall annoying to read."
4,Fun guaranteed,"Sandlin has a such unexpected sens of humor, you cannot stop laughing, at almost every line. I started reading ""Rowdy in Paris"", so funny I decided to buy all of the series which ""Sorrow Floats"" is part of. Read all of his book, you will be surprised with every page, it will keep you in good moods for days!"
4,Why aren't more people reading Sandlin,"He is a convincing woman. This, the second of his trilogy, is filled with memorable lines, characters, and laughs. Perhaps too amusing for his own good, Sandlin does approach serious themes (divorce, alcoholism, physical disability, divorce) but does so in such an hysterically funny way that you plow right through them in a mad rush to lap up some more dialogue.There aren't enough modern writers that write insane comedy this unaffectedly. Enjoy this book."
2,FYI,"The ""Customers Who Viewed This"" section is misleading. Having read Cowboy Up; Jumping Into Things and Don't Ask, Don't Tell, I assumed this novel would be erotica as well. It is not. No explicit sex whatsoever. Barely even kissing. The story was relatively cute, but I don't read relatively cute, so I cannot recommend this book."
5,Great reference - great gift,"I really appreciated the extensive research the author did for each section - she separates the folklore from the things that have been tested and documented, but presents both. I also like the suggestions and options she gives...if you want to follow a pre-designed plan you may, or you can pull together your own combinations that appeal to you or that work better for your situation. I have read my own copy cover to cover many times and have given this book as a gift to several like minded people. The two aspects of her system that really appeal to me are the reduction in weeding and the principle of ""no sprays""...I really disklike the idea of putting poison on my food!"
4,Good Reference for the Garden,This is a book that I refer to constantly when I need to look up a companion plants for the kitchen garden. The book also has many great ideas on how to plant the garden and shows how to rotate the garden planting in the following years to utilize the previous seasons plant enriched soil.Just a good resource book to have in your collection on gardening. There is always something new to learn about gardening.
5,Great for the beginning gardener!,"This is a personable and beautiful book. It may not be what the professional gardener needs, but for those who are just starting out, the pretty pictures and personalized tour of Sally's garden make the foray into my own garden much more promising. I haven't tried out her methods just yet because winter is coming on, but her information aligns with other references and makes total sense. I'm looking forward to using her book as a guide along with others for my first really successful garden."
2,"Great Garden Companions: A Companion-Planting System for a Beautiful, Chemical-Free Vegetable Garden",I was dissapointed with the book's content-I wasn't looking for a novel I wanted a reference on companion planting this was not that source.
3,Deceptively disappointing,"From the cover this looks like a practical guide to companion planting. However, when I opened it and started reading I found it to be verbose and too cutesy. It contains a lot of good ideas and information if you want to wade through it. The author is somewhat wishy-washy and lacks authority (which is both refreshing, but also unreliable). I would recommend another more thorough book like Sandra Perrin's ""Guide to Cold Climate Gardening."" or if you're looking for something more on the subject of companion planting (another deceptive point of the cover), I would recommend Louise Riott. This book contains a lot of general gardening information and should not be used as a companion planting guide."
5,A Constant Companion,"Great reference material, very well displayed information and very helpful even to the most ardent gardener. On of my best gardening book purchases in a long time."
1,Go with Amazon.co.uk for these dvds,"$78? For only one set of LOSW dvds? Don't pay such a ridiculous markup!Forget that-- if you're set with your region-free dvd player, just check out LOSW (and many other unavailable-in-US UK programs) on the UK Amazon site-- I've purchased both available dvd sets (Seasons 1 & 2; Seasons 3 & 4) for under $40US, including shipping!One star is for the price here, but four stars for the series itself!!"
