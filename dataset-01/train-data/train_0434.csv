2,Processor didn't last long,Loved the blender and processor until the plastic lid on the processor broke. A small piece of the locking mechanism made of plastic broke off.
2,Not a good blender.,"It seems to crush ice quickly and very well. However, that's as much as you'll get out of this thing. It leaked when my husband was trying to make some drinks in it. And it was extremely easy to overprocess stuff in the food processor. I tried an onion, and got onion mush, with a few hunks of unprocessed onion in the center of the bowl.Don't bother with this machine. Go out and just buy a separate blender and processor. I returned the duet ASAP, and bought a Cuisinart Little Pro (3-cup). It seems to work much better than the processor on the duet."
1,works great and then breaks!!,"After only using this blender for a few months to make smoothies, the black plastic wheel on motor base broke off. The glass blender top is large and heavy. Being glass, you worry about breaking it. The blender looks great but does not last."
2,not as good as I was hoping for,"I really liked this at first, in that I didn't have to have 2 bases for a blender and food processor, and it seems to work okay, but the blades on my grating blade seem dull, and the rubber pressure absorbing piece melted (both are for the food processor). It still works but it takes a long time. It is also really loud. I wish it worked better. Although I'll keep using it until it completely tanks."
2,Makes more noise than a jackhammer!,I have just purchased one and I already have second thoughts as it is VERY noisy. It seems to do a good job chopping and blending but I would not use it too often unless I wanted to make contact with the dead.
3,"Didn't last very long, and so LOUD","I thought this processor/blender looked great, and the Cuisinart name seemed reliable. I liked that is was one appliance to do 2 jobs. It quit working days after the 3 year warranty expired, the motor would turn on, but the blade would not spin. It was used infrequently over the 3 years, maybe 2-3 times a month, but it did work great until it died. Well I just bought another one, the newer model looks a little sturdier and for $69 at Costco, I thought I would give it another try.1/21/2012 update: I am returning the 2nd one ASAP. It is louder than the first especially when using food processor feature. Does not blend smoothies well, smells like burning rubber."
1,Broke within a week,"On the 2nd time I used it, the stem attachment to use with the slicing/shredding cracked and broke. I should have listened to the low reviews on this product."
1,Don't buy it,"I used it once, and it smelled so bad I thought it was going to burst into flames. The motor ceased on the first use. It is a shame because I do like cusinart products."
2,"Good Blender, but gear broke within 2 months","I bought this blender after comparing multiple options for a reasonably priced blender. As others have stated, the blender performance is great. I used it primarily for preparing protein shakes. It crushed the ice well and blended the ingredients into a smooth shake. Unfortunately, the gear for the blade broke in just 2 months after purchasing the product. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. The product is a good one if you can avoid what appears to be a common issue with this blender."
2,Cover your ears.,"I truly believe this appliance will damage your hearing if you do not wear ear protection when you use it. I never had a food processor before, and needed a new blender, so I bought this combo. Since I didn't know any better, I assumed all food processors were as loud as this one, but when friends were over, they told me, no, this one is really LOUD. It is so loud that I bought a headset ear protector that you would wear when you mow the lawn or use a leaf blower. I warn everyone in the house when I am going to use it, and never use it if somebody is asleep. If you don't mind the noise, this is a nice little package that works fine for occasional use. I used it numerous times before I figured out there may be quieter ones out there, so I cannot take it back. I would not recommend it because of the extreme noisiness of it."
1,Breaks,Had it for less than a year making smoothies with frozen fruit and veggies. First the plastic piece the blade is on cracked and it leaked. I replaced that for $25. Not a week later the part on the base that spins broke in half. Once again plastic. For this much money you don't expect plastic.
5,Great,"I've had this blender/foodprocessor for over 5 years and I have no complaints. It is heavy duty, no noisier than any other blender I've ever used and saves a lot of space since it is two appliances in one. We have used the blender for frozen drinks, potato pancakes(don't have to grate the potatoes), milk shakes etc. Have used the food processor for shredding and slicing vegtables for of all sorts and never had a problem. There is no burning smell (if there was in the beginning I don't remeber it) and nothing has broken."
2,Earplugs might help,"They should have included earplugs in the box as this thing screams at me until you either have a headache or quit. How could anyone design a blender with a decibel level matching that of a schrill or 737? I was excited to recieve but very disappointed in the overall design and function, never really blends well either."
1,Horrible product,My replacement just died. Over the life of both of my machines the blender never worked quite well and now the 2nd one has just plain died after a year. I thought Cuisinart was a good brand! I'll be very careful before buying one again.
1,love it or hate it,"I saw a deal on this duo and bought it for christmas. The blender's glass jar is pro worthy. The food processor's is an average, but still good. What killed it and made me want to send it back (but needed one for the time) was that it is LOUD. Some reviews say its quiet!... maybe mine was broken. You can not hear a person speaking while the motor is on. Everybody, no mater which room your in, jumps when it goes on. Get it if you want to wake everybody up. Other than the noise it does what it should."
1,Never use it since it is nothing what I expected,"Try it several times, first times, the noise makes my sleeping daughter crying. Second times, I cannot make all food into smoothies even after I read the instruction. So, never really use the product."
3,Pretty good,"I think this combo is great for the price, though it would not be as high a quality as either part sold alone.I use the blender part maybe once every two weeks - so it probably won't do for a daily blender but it certainly hasn't given me any major problems in the two years I have owned it.I do love the food processor piece. I make hummus and pesto on a regular basis and this does an excellent job with both of those things."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I own this blender food processor duo, and if you are doing soft food, with alot of liquid, for a short period of time this is the machine for you.if you are into juicing/smoothies etc with solid/frozen foods than this will not work. since the 2years i have owned this cuisinart i have had to send it back to them 3 times for the motor petering out, and all 3 times they simply replaced the whole thing. its a pain in the butt having to pay to ship it off and back for an error on thier part.dont waste your money like i did, get a beville they PULVERIZE food."
2,Cuisinart duet blender/food processor,I really liked the look and feel to this blender/food processor combo. It was really very user friendly. I used it to process cooked meat for my cats. However after using it daily for 7 days it would work intermittenly. I never knew if it was going to turn on or not. Unfortunately I returned it after 10 days.
2,cheap but not that great,"If you are looking for a basic blender/food prep combo, it's fine. But keep in mind the blender doesn't do ice crushing very well. I just bought a 600 watt Oster with the reverse motor feature and 6 blades and it crushes ice like a champ. The food prep is good, just have to wear earplugs when you use it....I'm not kidding. It screams. My food prep lid broke and now I have to hold down the lid when I use it. I think it is better to just get a good blender and get your food prep processor separately"
4,Good but expensive,"The product is wonderful, especially for couples who are starting a life together in small spaces.I received the product within the stipulated time and in perfect condition, but days later I saw the same product at a Costco store in Orlando 25 dollars below the price at which I bought from Amazon."
1,"Great, and then Disposable landfill fodder","Worked great, then failed. I really dislike how kitchen appliances are made to be disposable.. it is such a waste."
2,Too Loud,"My only problem with this blender/food processor is the noise. It's so loud it scares people and I hate to use it. I kept thinking I must have done something wrong when assembling it, but that is almost impossible.They should give you earplugs with this duet or have some kind of warning."
4,Cuisinart SmartPower Duet Blender/Food Processor,I was very pleased with the purchase of this product. It's a great and convenient item to have in the kitchen. It arrived very quickly and was packaged perfectly as to avoid the product being damaged in any way during shipment.
2,It's OK until it breaks.,My little food processor is still going strong but the blender didn't last long before it started leaking everywhere every time I used it. I finally gave up and threw it away. Not for the serious cook.
1,I have the blender and it broke after only 1-1/2 years!,"My husband and I received this blender as a wedding gift and it worked wonderfully until one day when we were making smoothies, the black piece that spins (connected to the base) completely broke! We were very frustrated because we've probably used the blender ten times since we received it. We were planning on getting Cuisinart to replace it, however after reading all of the reviews, I've decided to get rid of it (it never seemed that solid anyway)and buy another blender. No blender should break after such a short period of time and to have horrible customer service in addition to the breakage is unacceptable. Blenders should last at least a good ten years or more, especially with limited usage. I would recommend avoiding all Cuisinart blenders. The normal food processors are awesome, but the blenders leave little to be desired."
2,"Blender's ok, Food Processor's fragile","We've had ours for a couple years. After a few uses, the plastic ""ears"" that lock the processor bowl in place (you know, after you twist it on), broke off...so we've had to carefully hold the bowl in place while using it.Recently, the bowl has completely cracked, so we're tossing the food processor parts.Now, the blender works fine, BUT as a blender alone, the capacity is far too small for its tall profile, so I think we'll be looking for a new blender pretty soon as well.I wouldn't not recommend this product, unless you plan to rarely use either appliance."
2,Annoying Is Not Cool,"My wife got this because it looked cool -- black bases, stainless steel and chrome. Yeah it looked great. The problems came almost immediately though -- the lid fell onto the counter and cracked. Mind you we have *plastic* counter tops! Also, the grating wheel has a tiny, hard to store, plastic adapter that was easily lost after a month or so. The blade just munges food into mush and never really chops."
2,As others have mentioned,I really like this unit when i first got it. I had a krups blender before which i thought was horrible. Anyways it made margharittas relatively well and did everything i asked of it. The food processor attachment was also nice in that i don't have to get the full size processor out which is a hastle. Anyways after about 1.5 years of usuage the machanim that holds the blade (the drive gear in the motor contact this within the jar) has cracked. I was making hot sauce which shouldn't even been difficult at all for this machine to process. I would have gave this a 4 if this mechanism hadn't cracked. I will be going with another blender since so many other people have reported the same thing. To bad this could have been a great blender if cuisinart would have fixed that problem
1,Did not last long,This seemed like a good idea but the blender which I use almost daily for smoothies died within 2 months. The blade assembly bearing seized and the friction burnt and cracked the plastic around it. I do not reccomend this unit
2,Do Not BuY,"I got this item as a wedding gift. I used the food processor almost daily until it broke down on me. I emailed and called Cuisinart and got no response. The blender, however, works great. This is a great product to save counter space but it is not a reliable product."
1,I'd rather be next to a jet plane engine,"Worked great at first and was not too loud. Now after four years and not much use we decided to start using it again because of making baby food. Well, the baby has to be at the other end of our home and you need to wear professional ear muffs/guards to be able to stand next to it while it is processing. The muffs still don't even block out the majority of the horrendous shrilling noise.It chops the food fine in the processor part, but the blender doesn't work well blending fruit(always having to take off and shake around content so that it will blend it up).DO NOT RECOMMEND, JUST FOR HEALTH SAKE!!!!"
2,Not a great product... for Cuisinart,"While this product ultimately works, and works reasonably well. Like others that have reviewed it my bowl has cracked, on one of the locks. The motors makes some funny noises and generally doesn't show much durability.I only use this casually for light tasks and for it to be showing so much wear and a general lack of durability, I'm terribly unimpressed. It's a good blender and a so so food processor."
1,Blender works fine-- Food Processor is no good.,"I bought this because I didn't have a food processor, and my blender had broken. I thought this would be a good compromise for my small kitchen. The blender has always worked fine. The food processor, however--1. When I got it, a small piece was missing, which meant I could not use the shredder/slicer. I had to wait months for Cusinart to send me the missing part.2. The bowl of the food processor cracked. Specifically, one of the locks that hold it to the base. Now, when using it, I have to hold the bowl down with my hand. There is also a crack in the top.3. It doesn't work well at all for grating cheese, which was the main reason I wanted a food processor! I end up with big chunks of cheese trapped between the top and the shredder blade.All in all, I don't recommend this product. The food processor should work as well as the blender... but it just doesn't. The work bowl is far too flimsy."
3,not stainless steel,"I was misled by this blender's looks. It's not definitely not stainless steel. Overall it does its job, and I like that its size is not too big."
1,Junk Food Processor,"Buyer beware! Mine broke trying to shred cheese with it. Seems the black gear housing between the motor unit and the blade is garbage, not well designed and fails. Replaced under warranty but I bought unit with the expectation of being able to use it..."
1,Wouldnt even work!,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas - the ratings on Amazon gave it 4.5 stars...then the thing didnt even work...so i sent it back and went to go get another and all of a sudden Amazon gives it 2.5 stars...worthless, dont waste your time"
2,"Nice features, but cheaply built and under powered","I bought this blender to make smoothies and as a food processor when I need that function. It does the basic functions fine. I wouldn't recomend it bacause I find it to be very under powered. When making smoothies, the motor smells very bad and a couple of times it's over heated. I only used frozen blueberries and frozen strawberries, never use ice. Also, I'm only using this once or twice a week and feel I'll be lucky if this appliance last 2 years."
3,Surprisingly Powerful,"I was surprised at how much power this little blender has. I LOVE the blender. The carafe is heavy, and it whips through frozen fruit and ice with no problem at all. The food processor container is a lot smaller than my regular Cuisinart, which I was buying this to replace. It does a decent job of shredding cheese and chopping things but it is... jerky? I can't think of another word for it. Definitely NOT the quality that a full sized Cuisinart food processor has, but it gets the job done. I don't really like having to change out the center spindle when using the food processor, either. The blender though, is fantastic."
1,Very poor quality!,"Received this set as a gift; was thrilled with the Duet idea. Quality is poor, blender leaked out the botoom almost immediately; hairline crack- repaired with gorilla glue; - Processor really too small for dressings and sauces; hard to remove base; and plastic broke by one year- blender resumed leaking- the entire set is in the garbage now. My 20 yr. old gold Oster blender came back in from shed. For Cuisinart, this is junk.One star for the idea only!!"
1,So Done!,"This thing sucks eggs big time! It's noisy, and liquifies everything I try to chop. Heck, it won't even crush more than three ice cubes at a time! Thought I was getting a good buy when I got it on sale at Christmas time. NOT! My birthday is in a couple of weeks and I've already put in my request for a new Cuisinart food processor. LOL"
1,I bought it used.. it looked brand new....it worked about 2 weeks and now its broke....,Very disappointed with this. It looks so nice and so easy to use. But after several smoothies over the last two weeks...I started smelling burnt wire smell...it leaks from the base and suddenly it wont fit back down on the base properly and it is loud...which I can live with if it easy to use...but I had to throw it away....too bad... I really liked it...
5,Blender/Food Processor,Love this Smart Power Duet. It is just what my daughter wanted for Christmas. She has called each time she's used to tell me how much she likes it. Service was great.
1,look elsewhere,"looks great. but inside is too slick and wide to do any real grinding. everything just slides around, making it a frustrating experience."
4,loving diana,i have always loved diana ross and was looking forward to recieving this cd...love her although i do think some of the songs were a bit out of her vocal range...i was quite surprised to hear her singing OVERJOYED which is not a xmas song but is a song written and recorded by stevie wonder...it happens to be one of the best songs on this cd!!!! i have always loved this song and diana does an excellant job...i am rating the cd a 4 only because it isn't a complete xmas cd...
4,"Smooth, slick & sincere","Wilcox shows his mastery of the singer-songwriter genre. He's got a terrific voice (great control, with a tone resembling and almost as pretty as James Taylor's) and a great ear for lyrics.Most songs feature standard folk-y guitar, but with a variety of accompaniments and soloists that keeps the music changing and interesting. (And having backing contributions from aces such as Jennifer Kimball, Alison Krause, Victor Wooten and Steuart Smith doesn't hurt!)The real stars are Wilcox's captivating lyrics. They're captivating. He lays out the standard folky treatments of social themes -- injustice, greed, war -- but in original ways that avoid the standard cliches. He also finds ways to demonstrate his well-known cleverness and humor, but without the cringe-making cuteness or heavy hand that most of his singer-songwriter peers wield.This recording should go down well with any fans of the genre. Solid, engaging, well-crafted work from start to end."
4,one of the best current singer/songwriters,"David Wilcox is a pretty amazing artist. He is a unique acoustic guitar player, a fine singer, and a songwriter who ranks far above the norm. This Cd is a winner for anyone who enjoys acoustic-guitar-based music, especially coupled with his thought provoking and obviously heart-felt lyrics. David Wilcox is a national treasure!"
3,"Nice, but a bit overproduced","Wilcox needs to return to a less fussy production style; his latest sounds too much like James Taylor's latest (and limp) offerings. He still hasn't topped ""How Did You Find Me Here?"" as a perfect setting for his introspective lyrics. ""Turning Point"" was actually a good direction for DW, incorporating more electric guitars and having a looser feeling--his sweet vocals need to be offset by a grungier background. He cold learn a lot from Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle."
4,Good Job David,"Well, all I really have to say is that it's hard to top an album like Big Horizon. There are some great songs on this CD but it just feels like something is missing....but it is a good CD.."
3,Almost worth the wait,"I was happy to hear David get back to the acoustic side, though all in all, it's not as approachable as his first three discs. This has a few gems as well as a few forgettable tunes, but is certainly a big improvement over ""Turning Point""."
4,A great CD,"I think this CD is great, but the Amazon.com review is right on. Most people who are not familiar with David Wilcox would get bored with the CD after listening to it. So, if you are a fan of his, or folk for that matter, you will enjoy it very much! Leaving You is a GREAT song!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this CD because I really liked some of David Wilcox's older music. In specific the catchy tunes and the meaning behind the music.This album was just bad, the music was not entertaining and there seemed to be this constant theme of protest against some authority that didn't exist. Much like you would expect from a high school kid listening to Pink Floyd or a burnt out hippy.Anyway, I would expect more. If Mr. Wilcox doesn't have the modivation to write I would hope that he wait's until he gets it before he put's out another album."
4,Fatal Remains,"I always enjoy Eleanor Taylor Bland's books. Fatal Remains is no exception. Good research into some of the early history of Native, African and European settlers in the Des Plaines area. Her descriptions of Native and African relationships since the European settlement of North America. Research wise, I did wonder about Isiah's supposed Ethiopian ancestors though. That needed explanation given what is generally known about the slave trade.Bland continued developing the relationship between the two police partners. Her books indicate they have become a well-oiled team over time as well as good friends.Her story line completely held my attention. I hope Ms. Bland continues to turn out more Marty McAlister stories. They maintain the readers rapt attention without the slash and gore of many of today's detective stories."
1,Disorganized & Dangerous Nutritional Advice.,"1) The book seems highly disorganized with no real structure. It does not have a clear, thought out plan and seems very scattered.2) The nutritional.advice is hogwash. I am male 5'6"" and 123LBS. Am I going to follow this hackneyed diet advice & put on probably 50LBS of fat?? Heck no. If I did, I would need to spend 4 hours a day at the gym and 2 of those high intensity cardio.Telling people to 'eat 4,000 calories a day' (at least) train for a few hours a week, and you will 'bulk up & get big' is misleading & dangerous. What real doctor or nutritionist would advise this. And even more absurd if you work a traditional 9-5 office job & only workout for 1 or 2 hours a day. An average person needs 2,000 - 2,500 calories a day of a balance that is heavier on Proteins & 'good carbs', and very low in most fats & refined sugars. Still muscle development comes from hard training not eating until you are ready to puke,"
2,Not very helpful. Guidelines are not for someone who actually has a life and job!,I regret buying this book. It is mainly for someone who can survive on supplements or soup. Most of the routines and guidelines are very hard to do and you would look silly doing them anywhere people are present! I do no recomend this book!
1,Horrible book save your money,This book takes a very negative approach for the thin guy. avoid it and buy Arnold's bodybuilding book.
3,Needs more info on food,"I enjoyed reading the book and thought the science was convincing. I'm definitively a member of the book's target audience. The big problem is that it lacks information on food preparation after making food such an important part. I happen to be vegetarian so I'm at a total loss. But even if I ate meat, I would need a lot more direction on how to prepare these meals. Maybe they should include a cook book? (If you look at their sample meal plans, you'll notice that you pretty much eat the same food every day ... nobody can do that for more than a week!) Another concern: maybe it's true that you can't build muscles while doing cardio, but I doubt it. I just ran a marathon and I definitively put on muscle while training for it. Is it really a good idea to stop all but minimal cardio exercise???"
3,Well it is like the bulk up bible.........,"In that it's got all the fundamentals that you need to know hidden away in there, but like the real bible you have to flip back and forth all over the place and have a couple of study aids at hand to make it workable. If you're already au-fait with gym terminology and how to make a variety of meals from specified quantities of lean meats and vegs, then honestly this book is all you need.As it is pitched at people who've been battling with their frame for a while, I guess this is understandable. But if you're new to this business and are looking for a walk-you-through-it guide then, although this is a good start, keep looking, (unless you want to get the coaching programme* too).Verdict: Great content, hobbled by the editing. If this book was reworked, it'd be worth a 5.*$100 to you, sir"
1,Dangerous,"This book suggests doing dangerous and advanced powerlifting moves; if you do not know what you are doing you could get hurt. Most of the information in this book can be found on the net for free. Nothing really new here. Also, notice all the reviews near the end of November; the author is offering a free chapter of his next book for anyone who writes a favourable review. Buyer be ware."
2,Ectomorphs Only,"With all the complimentary reviews you'd think that this book was a godsend. Certainly there are good things about the book: its discussion of biomechanics and kinesiology, good demo photos, nutrition discussion, and friendly writing style. Here's the caveat: although the description of the book is for ""hardgainer's (although they eschew the term, they prefer the term ""hypertrophy challenged"" in their first chapter), AND they say that there is a difference between a hardgainer and an ectomorph, the rest of the book addresses the ectomorph. BUT what if you are a short skinny guy? You may feel a bit left out when every other paragraph laments the ectomorphic challenges of long bones, height, longer radius, kinesiology of those INCREDIBLY long legs that never tire and how easy it is to lift for short guys. What if you are just a shrimp?"
5,A refreshing approach to bodybuilding!,"When I picked up my copy of S2B, I read it from cover to cover in one sitting, laughing all night because every paragraph applied to me! I revised all my workouts to those outlined in the book, and have increased my weight from 130lbs to 155lbs in 4 months!! I'm lifting more than I ever have! If you're the typical '100lb weakling', get this book--you won't regret it!!"
5,Awesome Book!,"As a performance coach , I'm always looking for new material. This is one of the best books out there for the hypertrophy challenged ...and thats ALL of us.It covers assessments , postural, flexibility,muscular biomechanics, interval training, dynamic stretching( the mobility sequences are worth the price of the book itself)corrective exercise templates, and the hypertrophy templates themselves.Unless you've been hiding in a cave ,you know that Dr. Berardi has been kicking up a notch in the world of nutrition. I don't know that I trust anyone more in that field right now...no I don't.His methods have worked for my athletes and they will work for you."
4,loved it,"excellent book! has a fair share of editing problems making some of the directions a little hard to understand, but aside from that the workout routine really work. I have been working out for several years but have never had the gains I had on this program. I put on 20 lbs over the 4 month course of the routines. The book has a lot of no non-sense answers for anyone looking to gain weight. But putting in the effort is up to you."
5,Awesome Book,This book is one of the best books that I have read on the subject of building muscle. Dr. John Berardi is phenominal is his approach to putting on muscle. This book was extremely informative and contained only accurate informaiton. It is tough to find reading material with sound information backed by science. It is a true find!
5,All I can say is great book,I found this book extremely helpful and interesting. It made sense why I wasn't developing my body to its full potential. The book was fairly long but it was worth it.
5,Excellent Book - the onus is on the reader to do the work,"This book takes years of research, thousands of hours of work and places it into one easy to read guide. It's a bargain! I've made noticable changes since beginning the program. That said, the onus is on the reader - Berardi and Mejia give you the information - you have to tailor the program to your own personal situation. The authors give you the raw materials to design a program, especially with regard to nutrition planning. But you have to sit down, read the book, maybe twice or three times, and lay out a plan. It's the only way to learn and will pay dividends. Well written, you won't need another book, whether you want to build mass or just feel better and healthier by weight training."
1,Beware of the good reviews below,"The author of this book is bribing people to write good reviews by offering a free book to anyone who writes a good review. Don't fall for this fraud. If the book is really so great, the author wouldn't need to bribe people to write good reviews. Stay away! While you're at it, stay away from any other book written by Michael Mejia.Also, the book calls for a 4500 calorie diet and nine substantive meals per day. Do you really think a normal person can tolerate nine meals and more than twice the recommended caloric intake? Think about it."
2,not sound advice,This is not a good book. It doesn't describe the exercises and the plans it gives are confusing. Get Mark Rippitoe's Starting Strength.
3,How dedicated are you?,"This program will take you as much work as a part-time job. Are you ready to eat 12 egg whites and half a dozen other things for your FIRST breakfast every day? Are you prepared to carry food in your car and on your person all the time? Drink shakes before, during and after every workout?Some good advice and a lot of dense information here. The book could have benefitted from a ""Least you need to know"" type section like the Dummies books use. I was just looking for a what to do and what not to do in the gym guide. At least that way you might stick with it for the long term. Did answer a lot of my questions though. I wish it had been written years ago."
4,A decent double bass drum pedal for the money,"This is actually a pair of separate pedals, one with a fitting for an extra beater, and one which includes the extra beater and the link with 2 U-joints to connect the two. You could actually make 2 complete pedals out if it if you wanted. The whole thing seems to be very solidly constructed, and after a bit of adjustment, seems to work just fine. Now all I gotta do is actually learn how to play double pedals."
5,"Solidly presented, up-to-date, business oriented examination","Marketing To American Latinos: A Guide To The In-Culture Approach, Part 2 by Hispanic marketing pioneer M. Isabel Valdes is a solidly presented, up-to-date, business oriented examination and analysis of the Hispanic-American consumer market. From studying diversity, geographic distribution, and buying power of Hispanic households to advertising strategies that target the hearts, minds, and wallets of Hispanic consumers, to digital marketing and an ""integrated in-culture"" strategy, Marketing to American Latinos is an extensively researched reference written especially for big and small businesses alike. Also highly recommended is Valdes' predecessor volume, Marketing to American Latinos: A Guide To The In-Culture Approach, Part I (0967143934; $[price])."
2,New Research Outdates Valdes' Findings,"Valdes' findings have become outdated in the last few years due to the recent changes within the Latino/Hispanic demographic. The basics of her research might still apply to Spanish-dominant Latinos/Hispanics who are now the minority among this whole ethnic group, but not to the majority who are indeed bilingual, more acculturated, and prefer speaking English. This book does not apply to the new Latino/Hispanic -English-dominants, and thus, it is now outdated. Mari D. Gonzalez"
3,Crazy Cat Ladies only,"Not many patterns included, but a few good tips if you want to hook a cat rug. Joan Moshimer is well known in the hooking circles."
5,More than I expected,"I got this book (used through Amazon) because I wanted to know more about ways to hook realistic looking fur and not because I particularly wanted to make a cat rug. However, the book provided so much more than I expected. I would highly recommend it to everyone. There are illustrations of some gorgeous rugs in a great variety of styles to whet the creative appetite and a huge amount of down to earth advice from a real expert. The little practical hints on everything from fabic choices and techniques to dye methods and designing an original rug that are dropped here and there in the text are well worth the purchase price! There are also some lovely black and white drawings of cats by the author. This is ""a keeper"" as far as I am concerned!"
3,"Great Shape, Lids could be better","I love this shape, it is great for storing vegetables, and they fit well in the refrigerator. The ridges on the bottom are a nice feature too. I am dissappointed that the lids don't fit better. Mine gap in the center, especially on the longest container. I think for the price, they skimped on the lids."
5,Great sports shoe,"This is my daughters second pair of Mizuno and she loves them...plan on buying another! They fit right out of the box like a glove, very comfortable and stand up to all the foot action!"
4,Early wake up,Postive: It wakes me up without waking my wife up.Negative: After I changed the battery it had a tendency to leak and then not work properly. I have replaced the plastic watch band three times.Overall: Useful
1,"A Pilot Says ""Great Idea, Poorly Implemented""","My girlfriend bought me the stainless Vibralite3 watch as a gift. I am a pilot and I wanted to have a watch that would have the silent vibrating alarms, as audible timer alarms (used for holding procedures) are rather inaudible in a noisy airplane.The watch fell apart - the face bezel came unscrewed and then fell off. Before it fell off, it was just loose enough to make an audible rattling sound whenever the watch vibrated. The vibrations were strong enough, but the buttons were extremely hard to push and had no feel to them. Also, I never got the automatic 'flick of the wrist' light function to work. Night-owls, don't bother: whenever you push a button it turns off the night-light so you can't see what's happening!!!I'm looking for a new vibrating watch - perhaps a Casio G- Shock. Hopefully someone at Timex finally gets the idea to start producing a vibrating digital watch.-Danny V. ON, Canada"
5,LOVE IT,"I have had one of these pitchers for 8 years... my mom gave it to me and I thought ""I will never use this.""... I WAS SO WRONG! It is great for mixing up whipped cream and having the measuring lines on the side. I use it any time I am making pancakes...I LOVE IT!"
3,A construction book,"Great book if you want to know how to build structures like gazebos, walls, fences,pools, ramps,decks,irrigation systems,etc. It shows you the step by step with photos and drawings.This book is not the right choice if you are looking for plants arrangement."
4,"Pure, sweet and true -- Irish folk at its best","Just Liam's pure, lightly-brogish vocal and an acoustic guitar. Folk music doesn't get much better than this. True, more than half the album has been out on CD for awhile, but any true music fan will know this and gladly trade in the old one to get the 7 never-before-released tracks. Clancy was at his peak at this time (1963, I think) and it's definitely worth owning."
5,Liam Clancy Irish Troubadour,Liam Clancy is at his best on this CD where his style is that of a ballad singer. His voice and words are so clear. He reminds me of the clarity of Richard Dyer-Bennet. Although many of these songs are found on other albums the style of a single voice and an acoustic guitar gives them a new sound.
4,Not his best Album,"I just love Liam Clancy, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. They were all ""GREAT"". I was fortunate to see two of their concerts in NY. I have many of their albums CD & vinyl). I was a bit disappointed with this album. It lacks clarity and spark perhaps it is how it was recorded. I bought the CD because it had some songs on it that I did not have. I think the 2 CD album The Essential Liam Clancy is much better. If you are a Liam Clancy fan you do have to have the album which is why I bought it. No one sings like Liam. The best two songs on this album are The Nightingale and Patrial Game two of my favorites by Liam. There will never be a replacement for Liam."
5,Great Set of Bowls,"These bowls are great for mixing and storing. The different sizes make it convienient for just about anything you need it for. I mix my cake batter in the large bowl and mix the icing in the medium bowl. When you get ready to put these bowls in your cabinet for storage, they stack together nicely. Tupperware is GOOD quality and worth the extra money you spend on it."
1,Ancient history at best,"The high school that is the subject of this book was on a creative track, but then lost its way. Faculty understood the underlying principles, but did not have the methods or mastery to make the dream a reality over the long haul. Today the school has experienced serious violence, theft, declining test scores and many of the same challenges as any other troubled high school in America. It makes one wonder if Silva's book is anything more than a feel-good exercise in creative thinking."
3,Unsure of its usefulness,"Pros: Very thick, with many comments about (probably) all aspects of independent film making.Cons: I'm not sure that everything that is mentioned is really useful to someone. Perhaps it would be if the movie maker read all the way through the book, which is a big one. Then it may be a good resource."
3,Cute,"Still in the middle of it, slightly narcissistic, but there is talk of Middle Eastern culture that makes up for it. Writing style isn't great, but I've read plenty worst. A decent read for the gym."
5,Amazingly Intellectually Sophisticated Classical Written Romance Read,"Jiji's novel, extremely well writen, is characteric of the modern day, urbanized woman's novel. Amazingly energectic and a fun must-read. Couldn't put the book down and had to finish."
5,Exactly what I needed.,This battery worked well and has come in handy since the battery that came with my phone doesn't hold a charge very well.
5,Best product for me,"The ironing spray is also a wonderful room freshener and linen spray. When used as designed, the items ironed smell wonderful and clean. I have used it like another store product to spray on wrinkled items to smooth them so that no ironing is required. I love all the Mrs. Meyers products, but this is my favorite."
3,Mrs. Meyer's Ironing Spray,"I did like this as pre spray for Ironing, didn't leave my cloths stiff like a spray starch. I also used it as a freshing spray for some pillows and that left them with a clean fresh sent."
5,A MUST!,"A must for serious Tai Chi practitioners who want more than just the health aspects of Tai Chi. Glenn Hairston is honest and I reckon one of the best in practical application of Tai Chi. He teaches in a more reality based way. A practical approach to the applications of Tai Chi. He shows variations of the same posture, different applications but all in a simplistic way that you can easily learn and apply. This is not your everyday understanding of Tai Chi, this is meant for reality. Also I recommend his Informal series, currently there are three. Gives more in depth info about full body power and applications."
3,Good Resource for Working with Children,"This book would be a good resource for parents or anyone else working with children. If you've read the basic book ""The Five Love Languages"" however, there really isn't much new here in the way of principle. The authors just take the core concepts of the five love languages and state them in terms that pertain to children. The difference then, and the value of this book, is in the focused application. Is it worth the money spent and the time required to read it? I believe so. While the basic love languages are easy enough to learn, the key is in the application of those love languages to the various relationships of life. Words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch all translate in different ways depending on the relationship. If you're dealing with children in any capacity, this book will not disappoint you."
5,book,"book was very good. sometimes children reflect our own attitude when we're angry or upset, and they don't know what they've done wrong. this is a good read for both parents"
5,Love it!,"I haven't finished reading it yet but so far it is a great book but I knew it would be, because I have already read The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman and that too was a great book!"
5,Awesome,I recommend not only this book for the children but also really recommend the adult one. It is TOTALLY awesome. We can all get something positive from it.
3,Pretty good.,"This book created some very good discussion and has some really good ideas for parenting. It does seem to assume that life is simple and things are black and white, but with the focus on love, it's not actually a bad thing."
5,Love it,I love this book! I have two sons (4 and 2) who are very different.. I gotta learn to love them differently.
4,Great advice on how to fill up your child's love tank.,"This book is a follow up to the best seller book for couples, The Five Love Languages, that is awesome and I like to give as a wedding gift. Anyway, it talks about filling a child's love tank by understanding how they like love expressed to them, whether by words of affirmation, physical touch, quality time, gifts, or acts of service. They say that it really isn't possible to detect your child's primary love language until they are about five--so express love in all these ways while they're young and until you find out which way is most meaningful to them. One way to determine their primary love language is just to ask them how they know you (the parent) love them and see whether they describe presents, time together, things you've done for them, etc."
4,Love in Every Language,"This book not only fully explains the concepts and provides a means of identification, but also practical and useful common sense ways of showing love to your children in all five love languages. There is also a further reading guide to help continue your education. I personally do not agree with every concept brought up in this book, but I do agree with the overall theme. I believe if all parents could make their children feel loved it would cut down on a lot of problems in our society. This will be a continuing mainstay of my library and periodically be reread to remind me of the kind of parent I want to be and my children need."
4,Sound advice for parents,I am fan of Dr. Chapman's Love Languages books and this one is no different. It contains sound advice for developing and maintaining a loving relationship with your child. The information I appreciate the most is the description of what that realtionship looks like and an explanation of the importance of developing and maintaining that type of relationship. I wish I had a copy to give to everyone I know who works with kids.
3,Too bad this is so poorly written and disjointed in its presentation,I love his Five Love Languages book so I looked forward to reading this. What a disappointment.Not everyone is a good write and I do hope he'll republished this valuable content in a more readable book.
1,Unbearably banal,"I have difficulty imagining a parent reading this book and exclaiming, ""Of course!"" <smacks forehead> ""I'm supposed to *hug* my child!""I'm going to do you an enormous favor and list the five 'Love Languages' discussed in this book.1) Touch your child (hugs, etc...)2) Talk to your child (words of encouragement)3) Spend time with your child4) Encourage giving5) Encourage receivingThat's it! Somehow, the authors (amazingly, it took two) managed to fluff this into an entire book. As you'd expect, it is devoid of content - just inane observations any decent parent should understand instinctively. There is no hard research, no references to studies or books, well... except Bible quotations.This is cheap, sickly-sweet, pseudo-therapy for empty minds. Skip the book and spend time with your kids."
2,Not much information,I found this book pretty worthless. The information was all common sense stuff that I think most people normally do with their kids.
2,an anti authoritarian child,"An anti authoritarian child is in our opinion, a smart child! However the writers, and advocates of the bible who wrote this book, consider anti authoritarianism to be a negative manifestation in children.Although our egos, as parents may not be happy to hear the word ""No"" from a child. We believe the reply one should give to most authorities on this planet is ""NO"" !!!!!If you can name the five love languages, or find an alternative soucre to get this info, then you don't need to read this book..."
5,I HAD ALREADY READ THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES,"I had already read The Five Love Languages (for adults) so I didn't really expect to get much additional out of The Five Love Languages for Children. The first book had a major impact on my marriage and so I thought I would listen to the CD for children to see if there were a few additional tid bits. The CD has a lot more information than just the love languages. It really helped me to see how to better discipline my child in a more loving and more effective way. I have a son with Asperger's that is challenging. We used a lot of behavior modification with him, that has been effective but I noticed some anger and defiance starting. This book really helped me to better understand how to make sure my son feels undonitionally loved. His attitude has been so much better as I have applied what I have learned. I recommend it highly."
5,"A ""Must Read"" for every parent.","This is by far the best book on child communications that I have ever read. The truth offered in this book is both refreshing and enlightening, and offers great insight into learning how to best communicate unconditional love to our children. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all parents, grandparents, and childcare workers."
4,"quick easy read, yet great info","This book made a lot of sense as it described the 5 ways the people in my life (not just my children) give and receive love. As a busy at-home mother of 3 that are age 3 and under, I am already formulating little ways throughout the day to efficiently make my children feel loved that won't keep me from getting my daily work done! It includes a brief chapter on the single-parent household and also one of a typical marriage and how our children learn to behave as adults from us.I was disappointed in the small amount of info on how to effectively discipline based on which love langage a child is - it basically says 'don't use the love-language of that individual child or they'll think they don't love you instead of just being disciplined', such as don't spank a physically affectionate child and don't speak harshly to a ""verbal"" child. I was hoping for more alternative ideas that can be effective for each child based on their love-language."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR ANYONE,"This is a great book for anyone. It opened my eyes to why my child reacts the way she does to a lot of things. It also made a light come on to my husband's love language. Also, since I have a niece and a lot of nephews, it helped me talk to them in their own language. LOVE IT! A must read!"
5,Excellent,This is an excellent book ! I have gained so much insight on the emotional needs of my son and I reccommend this to anyone who knows they need help in showing their children how important they are. This is an easy read and has been a big help.
3,Some good child-rearing material,"After his wonderful book,The Five Love Languages Dr. Chapman wrote this book with children in mind. With this book parents can learn how to express to their children how much they love them in a way that the children will understand. Overall, it is a pretty good book, an easy read, and with some good lessons."
4,The Five Love Languages,"The Five Love Languages of children is a inspiration book that will ultimately unlock your understand of how to love your children that way they can understand.This book will undoubtedly empower every reader. I, too, recommend ""365 Prophetic Promises & Blessings for Your Children"" for all parents who desire the best for their children."
5,Must have!,I believe this is a must for any parent. This book helps understand your child in ways you never thought possible. This book helped me be a better parent.
5,WOW,"I can not believe the difference in my children since I have read this book and practised what is in the book.I have worked out my 10yr old son's love language is touch. I started cuddling him more he blossomed. I said to him ""Does me cuddling you make you feel more loved?"" he said ""yes""......it was as easy as that.What a book, I love it. Thank you.The book was hard to find, but it found it easily at amazon, and they delivered it to Australia so quickly."
5,Great book.,I thought this was a great book. It seems like such a simple idea but as a parent it is easy to overlook the fact that different children need different types of communication. The book does have some Christian overtones but this is not a religious book. The ideas offered could be used by any parent.
5,AWESOME!!,"a friend of mine bought a back pack SIMILAR to this (with a different brand) worth $200++ during our road trip....but mine (the high sierra) is WAYYYY sturdier, looked great! a lot bigger, and much better!!! VERY GOOD QUALITY and only for $95 this is the BEST travelling bag you can get...SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!You can place a lot of stuff....it has two compartments for water bottles on both sides....i can't say any negative on this bag...i so love it!!!"
5,Great everyday/travel bag,"I bought this as a gift for a friend, she uses the smaller bag for everyday use (laptop and notebooks). The straps are very comfortable and the product over all is very well made. Just wish they were in stock more often so I could get one for myself!"
4,Perfect bag for catching a connecting flight.,"This bag is great for carry-on only flyers. Plenty of room for as much as 4 days of changes of clothes. Removable backpack is very comfortable to wear. However, it could use a a couple more pockets or reorganization of the spaces in it's compartments. The backpack's big pocket's opening makes it a little difficult to get thing in and out. Overall, I'm very pleased at how functional and smoothly this luggage works. The handles are very soft and comfortable for when you need to carry the big bag."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"Took this on a little over 2 week trip traveling Greece & the islands. I wanted something I could just do carry on for the plane. It is the biggest you can take as a carry on so making sure you pack so the main suitcase does not bulge out is important. As long as you keep the 2 together while going through security at the airport the whole thing will fit through the security scanner & the airline won't care if you have another bag/purse/3rd carry on :) This was perfect, I was able to roll it around if needed or just wear it as a backpack. The smaller backpack is great for during the day when site seeing. This whole pack took some abuse on this trip but it is still holding strong and I will definitely use it again and again."
5,Great for airplane travel,"I got this before a recent one-week work trip to Haiti. It held everything I needed for the week, except for tools, which I had to check. It has plenty of pockets and compartments. The zip off day pack was handy for smaller planes where they make you gate check carry-ons. I kept the day pack with me and gate checked the other part. The backpack straps were handy since I had to lug two other checked bags filled with tools and supplies. The pack is heavier than a normal backpack, but I'll trade a little weight for better construction and convenience. All in all, very happy with it."
1,"Great Power, Poor Gears","We received one of these as a wedding present back in June of 2004. It ran great as of yesterday when the drive gear broke. I called Cuisinart and because I did not have a receipt, I received no help at all. No replacement, no service, and a very rude customer service agent. Luckily Bed Bath and Beyond took the mixer back and provided a replacement of our choosing. We did NOT pick a Cuisinart."
1,No more Cuisinart for me.,"I bought a beautiful $100 Cuisinart toaster about 10 years ago. It worked a little over a year and died. Cuisinart would not help. I swore I'd never buy another Cuisinart.When I was looking for mixers, this one was getting pretty good reviews on Amazon. I decided to give Cuisinart one more try. My ""smart power"" 7 speed electronic LED has died after less than 2 years of VERY light use. No bread dough, or heavy batters. Now I've purchased a much cheaper mixer with higher wattage. We shall see. At least it won't be much of a loss to replace a $20 mixer if it dies. But I sure am sick of sending small appliances to the landfill. Whatever happened to QUALITY, AMERICAN products?????"
1,Plastic gear failed.,"This mixer only lasted two and a half years with light home use. The motor and housing are well constructed, but the beater drive gears wore out too quickly. The right-hand gear completely failed so that the beaters bang together.Cuisinart has replaced my mixer with a new one of the same model. They were very prompt. We'll see how this one holds up."
1,Speed Deamon,"This hand mixer is SO fast it doesn't mix, it liquifies. I would NOT recommend this for basic mixing tasks. Big mistake to have bought it."
2,Do not Recommend,"This mixer broke down in the middle of Christmas cookies - and it wasn't that old. I purchased it a few years ago. The poor durability of this mixer in a brand that should deliver a better product is unacceptable. My old GE hand mixer lasted 5 times as long as this one did, and cost a lot less. I wonder about the quality of the motor if it could burn out in such a relatively short time. I do agree with other reviewers that the low speed was too high; no major differences between speeds 1-3; they were all fairly highspeed."
3,Low speed is too fast,"The lowest speed of this mixer is too fast for certain things (like pumpkin pie). Possibly if you used a very large bowl it might work ok, but when I made the pie the mixing got quite messy, with batter flying out of the bowl. Still need to use it more, so I'll see how it works with other consistencies. However, it would be nice to have one mixer that worked for everything."
2,warranty? what warranty?,"I bought this mixer on sale, at a department store & set it aside for future use. I was pleasantly surprised with the power...yet as others have noted, it was too powerful for wet foods...Does a larger bowl help? Rarely. I used this mixer for a little over a year and suddenly the left beater sputters and stops, rendering the whole mixer useless. I tried to e-mail customer service, several times...Always came back as an error. I finally made a telephone call.. a total waste of my time. The warranty had expired. Period. Would I buy another? Never."
1,Sucks,"So far, this book sucks. The author lost the plot and totally forgot the characters. Robin has never been swimming? But that's bogus. She clearly got swimming lessons from Chris in book 2. And Valiha says she ""doesn't believe in luck""?? What the hell is that?? The Titanides were all ABOUT luck in book 2. **SHE** was all about luck in book 2!!Total crap!!!"
4,A fitting resolution,"Though not quite as good as Wizard, this is a satisfying and pleasing resolution to the story line. Though the conclusion is telegraphed 3/4's through the book if not earlier it still was not disappointing.This is the most plot driven, character intensive of the three books. Exploration and discovery of Gaea are minimal and thus the wonderment of the previous books is lessened.The plot is developed naturally from what we knew before, the Hollywood obsessed ancient goddess is losing more of her faculties and needs to be dealt with. A plan is hatched and carried out.As with Wizard, the beginning sees the introduction of a new character who becomes a major companion of Cirocco as well as the reappearance of some of the original crew for the conclusion of the book.Like all the best endings, it is merely an ending, not the ending with many questions created and possibilities revealed for the future of Gaea, and the characters."
5,Great ending to a great trilogy,Demon is the best of the Gaia trilogy. I'm not sure if it is Varley's imagination or insanity that drives this book. You won't regret reading the trilogy.
5,My favorite novel,"DEMON is the conclusion of Varley's Gaea trilogy (TITAN and WIZARD are the first two). The incredible imagination and dramatic skill Varley demonstrates in WIZARD finally come together to explode in DEMON. The ending is brilliant and unexpected--and utterly dramatic: Varley's diversity of characterization (arguably his weakest feature) here is at its best. This is a book about rebellion, freedom, passion, strength, identity, and even love--ironically, because many of the characters are grotesquely violent, even visceral. But he reaches the depths in order to explode to heights which are yet somehow not tinted with melodrama. Varley's work is romantic, but not naive--definitely not naive. And it reaches its very best in DEMON. Easily his masterpiece, and easily my very favorite novel of all time."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The conflict between Jones, her allies, and Gaea, a particularly crazyvery powerful being, continues. Varley uses this to comment on andsatirise a religion or six, in passing, as well as throw in a wholebunch of whacky movie stuff, like attack of the 50 foot Marilyn Monroe,horny King Kongs and other such wildness.So from that point of view, the last book is a bit more interesting, and definitely more fun via this crazy war."
3,I saw it SOLELY for Heather Graham,"While this film is definitely in the ""WEIRD"" category, I can't call it a bad film. It is definitely low-budget, and one that 98% of the population has never heard of.The camerawork in this film is awesome; lots of dutch angles, high/low angles, etc. which work well for the story.The story itself is interesting, a self-appointed vigilante who runs his own death row after hours in a meat plant.If it hadn't had Heather in it, I probably would've never seen it."
1,what tha????,"This has got to be, hands down, one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story of a vigilante who has erected his own electric chair to deal with ""soft on crime"" policies after his family is slaughtered by an early parolee. Terribly acted, terribly shot. This movie is straight up crap. I started watching it out of camp value, issac hayes, lauren hutton, heather graham...I bet all parties involved wish this poo-bomb would crawl back to the depths of hell from which it was spawned. I saw that used copies were being sold as low as 43cents...this is way too much. You should be paid to take this off of someone. I don't know what kind of compensation would be worth the cost on your humanity. Please, for your own sake! Heinous!!! You have been warned."
1,Unhappy,"I bought this steamer because I liked the fan on the top and the two trays can hold more food then the steamer I currently use. However, the base that collects the water that has been steamed is not deep enough and has overflowed each time I have used it creating a big mess to clean up, which makes this a useless product. It's not even deep enough to hold the same amount of water that you put in the water reservoir. I wonder how a defect like that was overlooked....."
2,Not worth the money....,"I find this steamer a hassle to use. I purchased it primary to cook rice. The tray is big enough to cook two cups of rice - not much if you have a large family. Everytime you want to add something in, you have to take out the fan and it is a hassle, not to mention the danger involved due to the extreme hot steam!!! Everytime you are done cooking, the water needs to be empty and it makes a mess. I find that the rice cooks much faster in a convention rice cooker - a much cheaper appliance. Overall, I am disappointed in the product. If you have young children, be sure this thing is out of reach when in use."
3,For the students of art science,"This is essentially a scholar book for students of art science: lots of texts, few pictures, and in black and white. It contains a good discussion on the origin of animation, and it tries to specify its specific characteristics. It contains many and very diverse examples, but, of course, they work best as such, when one is able to see the mentioned films. I think this book really helps the reader 'understanding' animation (at least it helps to develop an analytical view towards animation as an art form), but I don't think it is suited for the average animation fan."
4,good.,i didn't like:*the small letters*the lack of picturesi did like:*the chaptersRecommend it to: Animation Beginners
3,Lacked depth,"I guess I read this in the wrong order, as I had just finished Grand Central Arena (loved it), and wanted more by this author. But apparently this is his 1st novel, and it shows. Not that its bad, it just lacks much of the depth and cohesive plot of GCA...it feels like a collection of short stories in chronological order. There's even one point where we get a brief recap of the events that happened only in the prior chapter, as if perhaps the reader had somehow missed it...just was kinda strange.I would love to see more from this author, as this DK shows a lot of promise -and GCA fulfills much of it. A sequel to GCA would be awsome, or even a sequel to this book that shows the polish of GCA, and a bigger scope that I can really sink my teeth into.This book is available for free download from Baen.com."
1,DO NOT buy this,"I just received this and feel completely robbed. It was not clear at all how small this is, and is definately NOT worth the price. On top of it all it doesn't work very well, it doesn't erase completely. If you want something smaller than the original get the travel size for the same price."
1,"Super small, not worth it","I didn't even look at the size on the listing, but this is way too small for anyone. Like a Kinderegg toy size. I returned it."
4,This Is How It Started!,"I enjoyed the plot of this cozy mystery, but I was confused at first. I have read other Leigh Koslow mysteries, and I did not remember her personal story. Then somewhere it dawned on me that this is where it all started. I guess I have read the books out of sequence. This does not matter anyway, because the plot and the storyline carries itself. I enjoyed the book, and will continue to read more of her story. Now I just know how it began!"
5,Never sorry,This entire series was a great read. I can't wait to read her next book. I love the way she writes.
5,A Captivating Story!,"After finishing Miss Claire's Never Buried, I was looking forward to reading the next book in her series. Usually, the second in a series is not quite a good as the first. Boy, was my assumption wrong! Never Sorry was a wonderful read. Leigh Koslow is back with her best friends in a mystery that will keep you reading until late into the evening. While working part-time at the local zoo, Leigh stumbles across a gruesome ""surprise"" in the tiger cage. Miss Claire is not graphic in her descriptions (thankfully!) of the crime scene, but your imagination will run away as you read the story. Leigh has another crime on her hands that she must solve for her own good. Add romance, wild animals, great friends, and a few psyco's from her past and you have the beginnings of a fabulous mystery! This book deserves six stars!"
5,Really good book with an interesting setting.,This series is quite interesting. Sometimes series start out well and then just all read the same. So far the author has come up with two totally different mysteries and both have been very interesting. I am hooked and will definitely be reading the next book in the series. Although each one is a complete and compelling story in itself and Leigh Koslow is an interesting character as are her friends and family I can't imagine not reading them all. Can't wait to see what the author has Leigh getting into next.
4,Zoos will never be he same for me,Interesting story with surprising ending. Behind the scenes in a zoo--i found it very interesting. You may find the answer yo the question --who is the wildest animal on this earth?
5,Great Series,"I got the first book in this series free on Amazon and was impressed enough to buy the second. Edie Claire is an excellent writer and these books are very good. Also, no inappropriate language or graphic scenes so that my 12-year old can also read the series. She's just starting this book, I'm on book 6. :)"
5,the 2nd one down. and I loved it too,I really liked number one and the 2nd book in the series was as good. I immediately bought the third. I cant wait to get to it. Thanks.
4,Very good mystery,This was a good read that I have now come to expect from Edie Claire. It was a very good suspense book a lot of things that I didn't see coming while also having a subtle amount of romance. Good choice
3,Yet -------------------- reasonable.,"Believe me, it is a really funny books, but I have already noticed how annoying -- sometimes -- the ""--------"", diggressions and oth&r stylistic instruments may turn the text not boring, but unpleasant. Someway, TRISTAM ressounds the attrocity that ULYSSES and FINNEGANS WAKE would be in the future, but -- truly -- TRISTAM SHANDY is sweeter and more human than those two texts."
1,This product is worthless,"I spent hours trying to get a topographic map on my computer. I read the instructions and clicked on every bottom in the program. All I could get was a regular map without the contour lines. I would think that a product sold as ""National Geographic TOPO"" would include instructions in how to view a topo map. I also had to reload the program several times."
5,Voices of Praise & The Psalms of David,"These are absolutely glorious and a must-have for your library! Great music, great voices and spiritually beautiful!"
4,Conversations...,"If you have you read the Network Marketing industry classic, ""The Greatest Networker In The World."" If you're like most Network Marketers, you loved this book.Conversations... is a continuation of that book, that specifically touches on topics of the actual interaction between people during the relationship process that is common in building your business, as it is in life.Not only does this book give you terriffic ideas on ""how-to"" at-the-same-time, this book seeds your mind with insights that will help to grow yourself, as well as your business.You can read this book online for free if you go to the website greatestnetworker.com Read it before you buy it!"
1,I never recieved my order!!!,"I ordered this book for my marketing class over a month and a half ago and I never got it. My credit card bill shows that the money has been charged...but nothing was sent to me. I've tried to contact the seller, but couldn't get a hold of her. I want my money back!"
4,Very Helpful !!,Highly recommended for those who are new to Marketing.There are so many examples which help to understand the theories much more easier.
4,"Great Value, Prompt Service","This is not the newest edition of this book, but it is the one that my sister is currently using for her coursework. The book arrived very promptly and in brand new condition. I highly recommend this seller."
5,Amazing how well this works.,"I had tarps made to stretch over the screens on my side porch. Over time, the the tarps had gotten more and more difficult to stretch to the snaps. This tool allowed me to stretch parts of the tarp further than I thought were possible. I put a lot of pressure into stretching some of the snaps, and the metal did not show any signs of fatigue.I highly recommend this tool."
5,Perfect snapper/unsnapper,"Purchased to snap and unsnap a pickup bed cover old style. If you have bad hands get one of these, it gives you more leverage"
5,Wonderful Idea!,"This is a great cake taker. The old Tupperware cake taker had a handle that was separate. I could never keep up with where I put it. This one has the handle attached. That is a good idea. I also like the way that the other side of the base has a place to put cupcakes so they will not slide around. I used it today to bring my cupcakes to the office party. It makes a great presentation too. This is perfect for mothers to send cupcakes to their children's class for holiday parties. It's great for cakes. You can travel with them and not worry about the cake getting destroyed. If you do not like to bake, you can purchase a cake from your local bakery and keep it fresh in this cake taker. Everyone needs to have one of these. The Round Cake Taker is also very nice."
5,Can't live without it!,"I bake a lot of cakes and have many different carriers. This is my favorite. It was stolen and I replaced it quickly. It is sturdy and secure and I like that it can be used for cupcakes as well as a cake. I place the cake directly on it rather than using a plate or cake board. Very, very handy!"
1,Wrong Lens for digital cameras with 37mm thread mount,"This lens is a 52mm mount for 8mm camcorders only. I don't know who put this in the digital cameras, but obviously they don't have a clue. I have to return mine!"
3,Completely Inaccurate Description,"It might be a nice lens, but I'll never know since the ""features"" listing is completely wrong. It is:- for a 52mm size lens, not a 37mm- a telephoto lens, not a wide-angleOK, I knew about figured it was a telephoto lens, based on the item name, but still, somebody got me this off my wishlist, and now it has to be returned."
3,PC Mover saves a lot of time,"My old Sony was running too slow so I bought a new Toshiba. I have tons of software and data on the Sony. I bought PCMover so that I don't have to re-install software. Little did I know that I have a lot of bad sectors on the Sony's hard drive. (That was the reason it ran so slow in the first place). PCMover does not know how to handle bad sectors and stops everytime it encountered one. After about half an hour, I decided to run the scandisk utility to fix all the bad sectors. After that, it was smooth sailing. PCMover moves EVERYTHING over, whether you want it or not. I didn't want to spend the time to figure out to use the advance option where there may be more control as to what gets moved."
2,We weren't impressed,"We are a musical family who has been exploring how to enter the music business for several years already and were looking forward to what this DVD would teach us. Though the processes of getting into the business are sure to be similiar, it seemed to be geared toward the hip hop industry -- which doesn't apply to us. The DVD bascially was a compilation of people's opinions. Granted, there were some nuggets of good information but mostly we found it boring and fast forwarded at times just to make it to the end. Overall, this wasn't a useful tool for us."
2,You can find the same information someware else,"First, I would like to mention that the overall DVD is not produced professionally. They say that you have to use CDs not CD-Rs to make copies of your album and they use DVD-Rs to make copies of this DVD! The sound is not professionally recorded, I guess they used a couple of HandyCams to produce this DVD with the internal microphone of the Cams. You hear a lot of shhhhhh, and to hide it they played a rap music in the background all the DVD.I think the DVD is made specially for rap music industry, because I find it hard to apply the tips suggested in the DVD on other types of music like jazz or flamenco.Still you can learn new things from this DVD, but not much."
5,Sad to Know that the Author is Gone,"I love the premise of this book and the cleverness of the stranger in convincing the pancake-maker to cook him more pancakes!Ms. Kahl wrote wonderful, memorable, creative stories for children. In response to one of the previous reviewers' questions: Ms. Kahl had lived in the Northern Virginia area at the time of your review, but she died in November of 2004. She was a friend of my mom's. We understand that she had been in the process of having her books republished, but passed away after only one book made it back into print. Be sure to look at ""The Duchess Bakes A Cake"" for this charming kids' book, now published by Purple House Press. Here's hoping that Ms. Kahl's estate makes the others (including the Perfect Pancake) available to the publisher for reprinting!"
5,"Rickey Smiley ""open casket sharp""","This dvd was everything I expected from one of the new kings of comedy, very funny,Rickey and his many characters,are just too much."
5,Okay,Rickey Smiley is pretty funny. This stand up routine was okay. I wouldnt watch it over and over again. Something to add to the collection.
3,New look needs new material!,"It got boring after first view, but watched it twice anyway. He needs some new jokes. The new look was nice though."
4,side cracking funny!,"This is Rickey Smiley at his best!! My family and I watched together and we were in tears from the opening set. The addition of the live band was a nice touch. Not expected for a comedy routine and we were concerned that it was going to be a performance, but it was all part of the act. only downside.....Rickey's pants were a little too short and not fashionable. Total high waters!!"
2,Rickey Smiley DVD - Casket Sharpe,This DVD was very disappointing to me and a waste of my money. It's the 1st DVD I've ever purchased and will NOT watch it again. I'm a die hard fan but do not like this DVD. I'm so sorry.....
3,Ricky Smiley OK,"My first Rickey Smiley DVD, his comedy is entertaining, just not my style. However, I did find Open Casket Sharp a keeper!"
5,These DVD is too funny!,"This DVD is my weekend go to for a few hours of relief and constant humor.I laugh so hard at every screen that I cryMy stomach hurts at the end, never get tired of watching itToo funny!"
5,funny as hell,I can't remember the last time I laugh so dam hard. Mr smiley is still crazy as Hell. I've got to give it to him 100% all the way.
5,Rickey Smiley,Awesome movie and this was great service through amazon... Gift was for Christmas an it was right on time! Rickey keeps you laughing until your stomach hurts!!!
1,Disappointed,"Received this item, placed it in my DVD player, didn't get to see a thing. DVD would not play had to return damaged product. I was looking so forward to seeing this concert on Mr. Smiley."
1,No Laughs.....and no love!,"HINT: If you notice people are not laughing and beginning to nod off in the audience, you're probably not funny! The best part was his marching band demonstration! I feel for all those in ATL who spent money on tickets to see this wackness called a comedy show. Hell, I'd want my money back even if I won the tickets on the radio...it was just that bad!"
1,not good,"I like Rickey Smiley. I think he is very funny, but this DVD was a big let down. For me there wasn't one good laugh in the whole thing (including the extras) I wouldn't spend any amout of money on this DVD. If you like Rickey you should look for some of his other stuff."
2,Rickey Smiley,"To be honest not very funny at all. Don't get me wrong I recently went to his live show which was hilarious, but he also had other acts. This DVD only has Rickey Smiley doing about an hour of standup, in my opinion this is nowhere near his best work."
5,Clean and Refreashing Smell,"My wife purchased this for me on our cruise to Bermuda on board the ship, it's a very subtle smell, but nice and clean and fresh. Good for work or play."
3,"red platter, not all red","The Le Creuset 16in. platter, is a great piece to add to your collection. The picture showed the platter being red all over, the platter I received was cream colored on the face of the plate. Still, very good quality, but I thought I was getting a red platter."
2,"OK, but it could be better","This Microsoft Entertainment pack is good, but the first one is better, also i wouldent buy it because you can download or play the games for free on the internet so you'ed be best of not to buy this item"
3,Mickey Mouse stickers not as shown in image,"--What I received was not what is displayed--These are stacked/layered cut-paper type stickers.The image is correct but the texture is not as shown.Image shown is a graphic representation of what is shipped, actual product looks like a good quality craft project.I was expecting something like a flat vinyl ""Colorform"" looking item (only sticky)."
4,great,comes in handy great product always good to have when riding bike around the city to many glass around everywhere you ride.
2,"Right idea, wrong brand and box","Not getting this brand or box. Seem to have gotten some cheapy smaller version from the seller. Haven't needed to use them, yet, but hope they last."
5,Huge Songs,They are catchy chunks of alternative metal with a glossy pop sheen that fans of Lostprophets (circa Start Something) should eat up with glee.
5,Amazing,"when i first found out about cornelius i was amazed. after hearing it in a friends car i soon picked up Fantasma (another great album by cornelius). I was very satisfied with my purchase. When I learned of a 2002 release that would be entitled Point, I wasn't sure what to expect. I saw possibilities that he might release songs sounding more like remixes, or else might go for the sound of songs like ""Star Fruits, Surf Rider."" Instead, this album seems to be more focused towards a certain style of music that is hard for me to describe but sure is excellent.With all the songs flowing together through the sounds of birds chirping and other sounds of this sort, i feel that this album must be listened from begining to the end with no interuptions in order to be fully appreciated.Basically If you are a fan of good music who is looking for a great new album try this out, i think you'll like it."
5,Retina-bursting Brilliance,"With the amazing ""Fantasma"", Cornelius quickly became dubbed the Japanese Beck. ""Point"" makes it clear that Beck is merely the poor man's American Cornelius.Like Brian Wilson channelling Webern, Mr. Oyamada takes pontilllistic stabs of bass, guitar, vocals and electronica to build unbelievably psychedelic and catchy songs. Imagine ""Star Fruits Surf Rider"" exploding into a million points of musical light, or Tom Ze arranging the Gang of Four to destroy Stereolab in the 21st Century Space-Age Pop Wars.In a nutshell, THE most original, cool, and Genius studio-alchemy ever committed to binary."
2,white nationalist work,"This is a collection of essays from the white nationalist organisation American Renaissance. The dominant ethos of the book is one of hostility to African-Americans. Although sometimes rooted in facts, such as differential crime rates, it is essentially a collection of polemics rather than of scientific essays.Personally I found the relentless hostility wearying, I think the authors would do better for their cause by concentrating on the value of white American culture rather than on the failings of black American culture."
5,Required reading,Taylor just doesn't make things up. He proves his essays which is why the simple hate his books and his web site: American Renaissance
3,Good Luck Finding This One! [Very Rare],"If you're a real Lee Michaels fan you may like this one, though I must warn you: You'll probably be blown away by the radical change! It not only had a Jamaican flavor, the 'old Lee' sound was completely lacking. Even the familiar voice with its distinctive wails and inflections was absent. I had to ask myself: 'Who is that guy?' I was disappointed at first, but after playing it again [and again!] it grew on me. I was even looking forward to it! Unfortunately, it's not one of his better offerings. If I had nothing to compare it with it wouldn't have been such a shocking disappointment. It DOES possess some nice tunes although most of them rely on the same beat. After selling this through mail order [I heard]on his own Squish label, I read that he retired to Hawaii. That's a shame. I miss you Lee and still have three pictures I took of you when you played the St. Louis Kiel Auditorium in 1971. God Bless you my friend!-Bob Sax"
3,He's graduated to be in the old-guy poet pantheon,"More nature stuff than I remember from ""Praise,"" which I rarely understand the point of. It seems an overly romantic view of the world. Whereas in ""Praise"" he was a young man in the midst of life, here he has stepped back away from it and is commenting on it from a distance. He seems more resigned than before as to what life brings and is not fighting for happiness. I guess it's the difference between Praising life for whatever it brings and being a sun under wood!Good things:There is an amazing transcription from Frida Kahlo.He also can get more into different characters that are not him, than I remember him doing in ""Praise,"" which is the only other book of his I have read."
2,Only Second Best,"Helffer is trying to make these masterworks his own - but at the expense of clarity. Boulez needs clarity of performance, otherwise these piano pieces could be written by anybody. Helffer rushes almost all the time. Sometimes his fingers are moving so fast that the notes literally don't speak. A good example is the 2nd Sonata, 2nd movement. In this slow movement, there is a frank passage of 4 against 3. Helffer can't really delineate this rhythm - compare this with the excellent Pollini reading, where this simple rhythm is fashioned into an apotheosis.Add to that (what seem to be) a few bad digital edits, and this disc is definitely second place. I don't know any better recording of the 1st or 3rd Sonatas, but Maurizio Pollini's 2nd Sonata is still the most breathtaking Boulez performance by a soloist."
1,Returned.,"I'm not sure which rocket grill we had, but it was on sale and we returned it back. Cleanup is certainly easy, but the rest of the plates, utensils, and pots and pans used during dinner still has to be cleaned up. With thinly sliced meat, results were no different than sauteing. Our vegetables should have been cut into smaller slices; the grilled vegetables were still raw on the inside. And the juices of the frozen marinated meat dripped into the paper bag ""fat"" catcher. If you're a single person who doesn't like to cook, I think this product is better than microwaved food, but if you can wash a pan, skip this ""grill""."
1,it dont work,i opened it set it on the counter. the next day i came home fromwork read the instructions. plugged it in pushed the button to warmit up. the red light came on and thats it nothing no heat dontwork. now what do i eat have to find something else. the timerworks real well. the red light looks nice but no heat. this thingover 2 years old still in the box and i got it for new. how do iknow how old it is theres a promo in the box to enter to win a flatscreen tv but you must enter the code to win no later than 10/09/07.its now today 03/03/10. no wonder it dont work been setting for over2 years. boy was they glad to get rid of this BOUGHT THRU AMAZON.COM
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought one because the ""no mess"" sounded wonderful. The first few times we used it, we thought it was great. Then we realized there IS a mess whenever the bag leaks down into the lower parts of the machine, and it will! We didn't even know it was doing it at first. Also, it gets irritating to have to purchase the bags which aren't that cheap. We ended up throwing the thing away, as there just isn't a way to clean way down in the bottom. I always end up going back to my cast iron frying pan!"
4,Replacing a must for the Kitchen,"Four or five years ago, when theSunbeam 7530 Rocket Grill Electric Grilling Appliancefirst came out, I was given a gift card to purchase the then over $100 Rocket Grill. This was to replace my umteenth George Foreman grill. I was intrigued with the idea ofSunbeam 7545 Rocket Grill Parchment Pouches, 36 Packto cook the food in and then just throwing the pouches away. When my original Rocket Grill broke (hey, that dial timed a lot of meals) I was desparate to find another (I had forgotten how to cook hamburgers, hot dogs, steaks, etc. any other way); and don't get me started about how fast it cooks. I didn't care if I had to spend over a hundred dollars again. Imagine my delight when I purchased it through Amazon.com for $57.00! This is THE best grilling machine, not to mention the reliability of the Sunbeam name.Thanks to Amazon.com who still had it listed (I couldn't find the Rocket Grill in any retail stores around my area)."
5,Works Great,I love this machine. I have been using it for 2 years now. Quick and simple. The best feature is that all the grease drains to the bottom of the parchment bags and you simply throw them away.
2,A so-so book for summer,"This book is not the best I have ever read. Carrying on in the tradition of ""Carcharadon"" and ""Megalodon"", we meet the giant shark turned human eater once again. Although far above ""MEG"", the book is often confusing or unrealistic. Come on, a fifty foot shark in a river! Also, there is not enought detail describing the shark and the author using ""gaping maw"" too much."
3,He has the location on the money.,"I live in south Mississippi and about a mile or so from the River spoke of in the book, and he has almost every single Mississippi Location Correct, from the River all the way to the President Casino and it's Marina, I am only on Chapter 6 for now, but it's been a good read from what I've read so far."
2,This book might need to go extinct,"Read the back cover of this book and you will begin to see the parallels with Benchley's master piece. Tourist town terrorized by gigantic man eating shark! Local hero and fisherman rush to save the day. I had just read MEG (another stinker check my review) and since this was actually set in my hometown I had to read this. Partly in hopes of seeing my home town well portrayed and partly in hopes of convincing me that the good marine biology thriller was possible. Wilson's shark is slightly more plausible than Alten's. At least it doesn't glow in the dark! All the action sequences are so rooted in unrealism that they just can't be scary. I'm thinking, giant shark thrashing around in a 6 foot deep freshwater river? Shark outrunning speedboat? Come on guys, some one has to be able to write about scary marine life."
5,A GREAT BEACH READ!!!!!!,"Charles Wilson's ""Extinct"", is a great book for the beach . I would recommend this book to any one who likes fast-paced intense thrillers.I think the possibilities of this book is very possible.If you want to know more about this book and why it might be true go to http://www.charleswilson.com/new.html If you liked JAWS, this is better!!!!HAVE FUN AT THE BEACH!!!!!"
4,In defense of the author...,"I have already reviewed this book and declared it to have shortcomings; however, I did have a fairly lengthy e-mail conversation with Mr. Wilson regarding this book, and he acknowledged he did not put the necessary description or feeling into the book to make as mesmerizing as it could have been. I hope all of you who give this book horrendous reviews will realize just how much work the author did put into this though he fell into a human failing of not adequately capturing our interest. I doubt any of us could have approached the creativity level of this or any of his books, and I feel Mr. Wilson deserves much credit for his work."
2,"Great idea, loses momentum","It's Peter Benchley in Jurassic Park, inventing a long-extinct giant shark that comes back to munch on the unwary. The idea is great; the book starts out immensely well, and then falls back into the water, having exhausted its momentum on the five or so scenes that would make an awesome trailer. If the giant monster you're trying to kill can be killed with regular methods if just a little discipline gets applied, don't you think the authorities will finish it off first? Yes, well... awkward silence... the characters are somewhat one-dimensional, and there are several arduous scenes of splashing around hoping the giant shark won't come back that put me into a coma. I wish he'd rewrite the whole book in the style of the first two chapters, with a similar amount of action or at least real terror."
3,Terror surfaces in the Mississippi River,"Charles Wilson's book was supposed to have been made into a miniseries for NBC-TV. While that didn't pan out, the SciFi channel would have a field day making this novel into a film featuring totally CGI sharks that are 100 feet long.The book starts with a shark (there's more than one) attacking and killing two small boys. One of the witnesses to the attack, Paul, is the only child of Carolyn, a charter boat captain on the Mississippi. She is joined by Alan Freeman, a marine biologist to try and find out what killed the boys with the help of a U.S. Navy admiral who knows exactly what they're hunting...but doesn't know how to stop it.Is this book better than ""Jaws""? No. ""Jaws"" was a masterpiece of fiction; this is an escapist read for a beach day in August. The details regarding the Mississippi Delta and megalodons are accurate and the characters are realistic and likable."
5,Excellent book!,"I Read this book in 4 weeks.I liked the whole book,but I thought the ending could have been better.I wished there would have been more attacks and more chases.I really like the idea of a 200 foot long shark.Now I want to tape the miniseries when it comes on.Reading this book makes me want to read MEG and THE TRENCH by Stephen Alten.Now I want to learn all I can about the Megalodon.Don`t be suprised if you hear of Megalodons surfacing at a beach near you.I live in Southern Louisiana,not that far from where this story takes place.As a message to all Megalodons out there,you can come but I`ll be ready and waiting.Come and get me."
3,ENTERTAINING,"I liked the book even though it didn't really tell you much about megalodons. I guess I expected the book to be more technical. The story sometimes was just unbelievable, like how a shark that big could hide in shallow water. But the book was enjoyable and entertaining but not what I would consider a must read."
2,AT TIMES EXCTING BUT TOO OFTEN SLOW PACED,"I found EXTINCT was excting at times but often more times than not I found myself wanting to do something else. I found this book too unrealistic at times i.e. the length of the megaladons that are described, especially at the end when the 200 foot long giants appear. Now I know we don't realistically know how big the megaldons really grew. But I found that length to be a bit much. Also I really couldn't relate to the characters at all. .They just didn't grab me and make want to rally behind them. Also, I doubt megladons would leave any part of a human being behind. since 6 grown men can fit in thier jaws. I believe this is could be, or may have been the shark that swallowed Jonah whole in the bible . All in all, in all I can't really recommend Extinct."
3,There's always a bigger fish...,"A young boy watches two of his friends go under water. His dog starts barking. His friends never resurface. And so begins Extinct, which will probably before ever known as the 90's other giant shark book, getting nowhere near the publicity (or blasting) of Steven Alten's Meg. But unlike Meg, this book takes it's plot seriously, and despite the name, revealling the Megalodon's presence is a big spoiler, as when the marauding shark is first discovered, it is mistaken for a normal great white. As for characters, well, I'm sure Wilson read a lot of Peter Benchley before writing this, because most would be right at home on the pages of Beast, Jaws or Creature. There is drama and action, with some mystery added, and in the end it is entertaining. But the twist in the end, while jaw-dropping storywise, is highly unlikely reality wise, which is not such a good idea for a novel whose main draw is it not as comicbook as Meg. Still a good read."
4,Better than Jaws,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although some of the ideas were far fetched;Sharks communicating vocally; many of the facts in the book seemed right on the mark. I would recommend this book to any shark enthusiasts who believe the possible existence of Megalodon.
2,Giant shark thriller is missing giant thrills.,"A big (and I do mean BIG) shark goes up river and begins feeding on swimmers and fishers in Biloxi, Mississippi. The book is as silly as it sounds.I will give Mr. Wilson the benefit of his obvious hard wark in researching how something like this could possibly happen, but sadly he does not manage to make his story easy to swallow, nor does he make it very suspenseful. Attacks happen, people either narrowly escape or are swallowed whole. It is hard to care either way. Also there is a twist, but anyone who has had a steady diet of this kind of material will see it coming from a hundred pages away. Reading this it is far too easy to see why NBC scuttled the mini-series. There really isn't enough material for a good saturday night movie!"
3,It was alright,I liked the fast pace of the book and was just a little dissapointed with the end. I still prefer Meg by Steve Alten.
3,Fast read,"I enjoyed this book. I read it while at the beach and it was interesting and fun. The Characters are pretty well developed. As Giant shark books go Meg was better than this book, but I feel this book had a better ending than Meg. There is nothing amazing or heart pounding here, but if you enjoy light books about Giant sharks you will enjoy the book."
2,unexciting shark thriller,"Although the premise was interesting, the characters seemed to be cookie cutouts, and the ""action"" had me flipping pages quickly to keep from falling asleep. I couldn't identify with anyone in the story and this book said to me ""made for tv mini series."" either ""meg"" or ""jaws"" seemed to me to be much more compelling."
3,The charactors in this book are as shallow as the water,"It's Jurassic Park ""JAWS!"" Shame on you Mr. Wilsonyour theories are ludicrous, and the characters in the book are as shallow as the water in the swamp.Yes this is a ""JAWS"" rip off not even half as good as the Peter Benchley orginal, but still fun, who wouldn't want to see a 200 foot shark.For sure not a classic but a good vaction read where you put your brain on hold for a while."
5,Great Art,Eric Sloane doing what he does best. The illustrations are superb as usual and so are the descriptions of how the tools were used. This book is bound to make you think differently the next time you are at a yard sale or fleamarket standing in front of a bunch of old rusty tools.
5,Eric Sloane is a master,"Eric Sloane has been dead for some time but his skills in writing and his art live on. I have been a fan of his work for over 40 years, reading his stories time and again. I had this book on my wish list and finally decided it was time to get it. Sloane writes of a culture long gone in America, a culture that made what they needed in order to survive and prosper. It would do us all good to look at that attitude today. He has many titles out there and I am slowly filling the holes in my collection of his works."
5,I Never Tire of This,"Those from this era will LOVE this set! Not only do they include the great instrumental hits, but they are (almost) all technically superb--one or two were recorded a little hot, thus a bit of distortion--but even those, I'm getting a little picky. Perhaps equal to the selections themselves are the copius notes that go along with each song, and even some trivia--like 'Whistling Jack Smith' (Kaiser's Batman)isn't a real person.This is out of print; get one now, and you won't be sorry."
3,Not quite one size fits all,"This robe came quickly and very efficiently. Unfortunately, the claim of one size fits all isn't quite what's its cracked up to be. It's not that the robe was too long, but it was way too big in most every respect - at 5'3"" my wife was swimming in it! Fortunately, the company processed our return fairly quickly."
2,Meh,"Bought this for my wife and am disappointed. What arrived doesn't look quite as plush as pictured, had a stain on it, and started to unravel after the first washing. Will probably stick to clothes shopping in person from now on."
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,Robe arrived as gift from a friend; what a waste of money. The first washing had it unravel along the hem line and belt. Lint trap filled up so full it was hard to pull the trap out of the machine to clean it. Material very thin. Not spa quality by any means. Keep shopping for the real deal.
5,A thoughtful and provocative novel,"Steal Away Home is a riveting account of a young man from Cincinnati in the late 1950s, struggling to find his place in a rather sordid world. His journey takes him through the jungles of Cuba and a world of trauma and mental turmoil, back home to a life of domestic violence and addiction. It is a compelling book, hard to put down, and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it!"
5,Excellent Book Worth Reading!,"Steal Away Home is a book that I think everyone would enjoy. The book has adventure combined with mystery and teaches the reader about our country&#65533;s past history. It is actually two stories combined in one. The present day story is about Dana finding out who the skeleton is in the boarded room. The past history story describes the life of the Weaver family in pre-Civil War times and its part in The Underground Railroad. The story goes back and forth in history as Dana reads the journal of Mrs. Weaver. The journal describes the comings and goings of black people on their run for freedom and pieces of the life of one of those slaves, Miss Lizbet Charles. The book makes the reader more aware of the difficult lives of runaway slaves. The story is informative and interesting. As the pieces of the mystery of the skeleton fall into place, Dana learns about her house&#65533;s history and her town."

2,Dreadful Sanctuary,"I am a fan of Eric Frank Russell's stories. This was one of his best in the magazine version. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, he rewrote the ending for the book version, and he spoiled the story. I recommend that you try to find the magazine version -- you'll like it. And you will be surprised by its clever ending. (I would give the magazine version 5 stars.)"
5,plastic clean,I use this on my motorcycle and it works very well on the plastic windshild.Puts a coating on that keeps the love bugs from sticking............
4,Excellent complement for the first book,"An excellent complement for the first book by S. Toguchi, this one includes more on the history of Goju-Ryu and the Shoreikan view. Besides some basic techniques, it includes Gekiha-dai-ichi and Saifa Kata with some applications (bunkai)."
1,YUCK,I struggled through the five 10 or 12 pages and threw this in the trash. Poor Chick-lit at best. I have to wonder - how on EARTH did this get published? Well I got a free copy from B&N - no big surprise why they had to give this POS away!
4,Asunder,Asunder was a fantastic weekend read. I found it to be highly charged and erotic and definitely recommend it. I can hardly wait to see it on the big screen! Blair Underwood and Michael Beach? Heart be still!
4,What a Thriller,"I enjoyed reading Asunder. The book keeps you at the edge of your seat or in this case the page. I couldn't wait to get to the end, but wanted to read more when I got there. Asunder is suspenseful, and a good read. I highly recommend this book to any avid reader."
4,Cutest toddler mermaid costume I've seen.,"When I started looking for toddler mermaid costumes for halloween, I found several that had the tail in front. My kid is hopelessly clumsy, so I knew she'd never be able to walk (read: run) like normal in it. Other costumes had pretty skimpy tops - I am no prude, but the classic mermaid seashell-bra is a little ridiculous looking on a 2-year old!This costume solves both of those problems. My daughter loves the tail and is able to move normally, and the top is cute and age-appropriate. It fits her great - she's about 28 lbs and 33"" tall and the skirt front hits about mid-calf. The costume quality is good for the price, although there are a few seashell-shaped sequins and random threads that are holding on for dear life and may need some minor repair if I want to save the costume for dress-up play after halloween night."
2,You gota have have Faith,Not for the weak in Faith as satire can be very rough. Jesus provides what we need through the Father and will use all things to the good of the Kingdom. Self--reliance is good and we poor humans are need so much sometime that we need to be reminded that we can do most things on our own. Keep this in mind and don't belive everything on the internet
5,Marvellous CD,"I think EL SWING DE CUBA is a reissue/ reprint of the classic Sierra Maestra LP ""Viaje a la Semilla"" from 1994.Still like it very much. Great songs to dance to. You might know most of them from numerous cameos - or even from your latest visit at your local cuban salsa disco."
1,Dog Tricks Volume 1,Big disappointment. I wish I could get my money back. These DVDs show trained dogs doing tricks but if you have an untrained dog you would do much better with something like the Bow Wow series by Virginia Broitman and Sherri Lippman.
2,Not Good for African American Skin Tones,This product feels okay on the skin but leaves a highly visible white film on the skin. I'm not sure if it is apparent on other races but it is very noticeable on African American skin tones. It looks like I've applied cheap foundation shades too light on my face.I cannot wear it outdoors in front of people during the day (and I'm cheap! :) ) so I use it as my night time moisturizer before bed. Imagine using an SPF moisturizer only to bed...Will not repurchase once I've used it all.
2,Please make sure you read that this product is expired before buying it,This is a very good product but according to the product specifications on this website you are buying one that has already expired. So if you are interested in the product be aware of the conditions you are buying it.
5,Excelent!!!! just Excelent!!!!,Incredible product for extremely irritated skin!!!! and I have a cousin that have used this product since a couple of years and his skin looks fresh and younger!!!! I have recomended to several people and every one calls me back to thank me for the advise.
3,Two-person theory,"This book is very good at explaining the mathematical aspects of two-person game theory, but it is very poor in its explanation of the theory. For those who are more interested in the theoretical aspect of GT, there are better books in the market than this one."
5,Good hat for those that know what they're looking at.,"I bought one of these hats back in 2007 I think it was. Have been looking unsuccessfully for a replacement as after 5 years of wearing it rather frequently, it is finally time to retire this one.Have gotten a lot more compliments than I ever expected to get from a hat, so that was a nice touch, always good to meet other fans of the anime/manga."
2,Interesting Antique,"To me, director Joe Sarno is an over-looked master of movie erotcism.But I'm giving this color study of surburban sin only 2 stars because all the eroticism has been edited out.There's no nudity, no sex and it could have easily been shown on TV.In the commentary by Sarno, he said that he deliberately played down naked bodies and sex but added that censorship boards also pitched in to do their own censorship.To really see what Sarno could do in black and white, check out ""Desire Under the Palms,"" which may not be available yet on DVD."
3,A Much used Theme.,"Realizing the film is over 40 years old is the only reason that I gave it 3 stars. I took into consideration the rules of Society back then.It was pushing the envelope so to speak. I have watched ""Laura's Toys which was recommended by Amazon and there is no comparrison.Laura's Toys is a 4 1/2 and they share nothing in common."
1,"Disjointed, difficult to follow.","Out of print? Good! This book is so filled with bits of extraneous material that it is almost impossible to follow. Despite considerable interest in the subject matter, and despite returning to the book four or five times, I could not distinguish which facts pertained to Sir Philip Sidney and which to the hundreds of people with whom he came into contact without almost graphing out the characters. It was worse than any Russian novel."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I have a small travel Braun razor and decided to buy the Braun 7505 on the strength of its smaller brother. I can say this was a disappointing buy. Yes, it does give a close shave if you are prepared to keep going over the area. I get a closer shave with my travel razor in 1/4 the time it takes to get the same result with the 7505."
4,It's Not Enough,"I was very excited to find this DVD, very disappointed that they did not release the whole season one and then two etc. Considering some of the junk that is on DVD, why is this classic getting this treatment? I loved this show when younger and upon watching it, realized by my belly laughing that it holds up well. We need more episodes! Not once during any of these episodes did Vanderbilt fall in the well, not once did the lookout tower get shot down, nor did Duffy give one of his ""at the Alamo"" speches. Please release more of this well done classic comedy."
3,This series and Cary Grant have an indirect connection,"This series was a sort of a Western predecessor of ""McHale's Navy"" (the original Ernest Borgnine series) in the way it centered around a military unit made of goofy misfits. This one was about a fictitious U.S. Cavalry unit, fort made of vertical logs and all. It's roughly the same setting as the old ""Rin Tin Tin"" series a bit earlier. The lead role is played by comedian and comic actor Larry Storch, who is credited by the late Cary Grant as having been the real originator of the ""Judy Judy Judy"" shtick used by most people who do a Cary Grant impression, on the amateur and sometimes even the professional level. Apparently, according to Grant, Storch was playing a nightclub gig and was in the middle of a Grant impression when Judy Garland showed up as a patron, and Storch greeted her in character."
3,* ONLY 6 EPISODES *,"FYI - This dvd includes 6 episodes only. 3 b&w;, 3 color. There are no special features. There is no chronological order to the episodes - it seems they were chosen for the guest stars. The episodes are:1 - ""The Return of Bald Eagle"" with Don Rickles2 - ""The Girl From Philadelphia"" with Edward Everett Horton as Roaring Chicken3 - ""Indian Fever"" with Victor Jory as Mean Buffalo4 - ""The Singing Mounty"" with Paul Lynde (singing ""I dream of Wrangler with the light 'yeller' hair"", and Larry Storch playing Agarn's French cousin Lucky Pierre, the suspected 'Burglar of Banf-f'). Great episode.5 - ""Bye, Bye Balloon"" with Harvey Korman as Prussian Col. Heinrick Von Zeppel.6 - ""Our Brave in F Troop"" with Cliff Arquette (whoever that is), as General Sam Courage.For desperate F-Troop fans it's better than nothing, but it's disappointing to only have these few arbitrary episodes.Follow-up: YAY!! Both seasons are now available on dvd! Worth the few extra bucks."
4,Classic comedy,"This DVD reminds me of the good old days when you didn't have to worry about covering your children's eyes and ears when watching TV. The cast of F Troop is hilarious. Good, clean, and funny."
1,Stopped working after two weeks.,"Got this in a bundle with a 2gb micro-sd card. It never would read all of the space on the bundled micro-sd card. When I tried to format the card through this reader, it only formatted 1gb. When I formatted it through another reader to 2gb and inserted it in this reader, it wouldn't read any directory information from the card.As of two days ago, however, it won't do anything. I've tried three different computers, four different micro-sd cards: it's a lump. Pretty amazing for a device with no moving parts"
4,"Great product, not so hot vendor","I have used the card reader several times with no problems experienced. That said, if I had to purchase again I would not do so from BLUEPROTON. My initial purchase was to be a 32Gb micro SD card. When I was ordering there was an offer, from blueproton, for free shipping on orders over $50 plus a free micro SD card reader. The micro SD reader shipped seperately and I was billed for both the product and the shipping. When the 32Gb card shipped I was charged for shipping again in spite of the fact that the billing price for the item was in excess of $50. I will never purchase another product from BLUEPROTON and I have lost considerable faith in Amazon for allowing a vendor with so little ethical integrity to remain on their site.I would suggest to all who will listen that they look elsewhere for product."
1,This should have a minus 1 star,"I bought the little Blue Proton micro Drive back in Sept. planning to use the card and put music on it to use in my MP3 player. It would never show anything when I'd put in into my computer, but the case would get so hot, I could barely handle it to take it out again. I wasn't sure what the problem was. Just recently, I was able to use the little micro SD card in another item, and had no problem with it, in use, or with heat. I tried it again in the Micro Drive, and it again go too hot to handle. I sent a note to Blue Proton shortly after receiving this item for some instructions, thinking I might be using it wrong. They never responded to my e-mail."
4,Great card readers,"I have numerous micro SD cards that I have acquired over time and wanted to be able to use them as pen drives. I like the fact that the multi-use lanyard on this card reader is made of metal. The see through plastic is nice, though the color could be a bit more asthetic, but we are going for practicality, not fashion. I was not pleased with the sellers shipping cost. It doubled the price of the 2 pen drives. I bought a 5-pack of similar card readers on Ebay and paid less than half for the product and shipping for those 5 then I did these two. Though the quality was not quite what these card readers are, all 5 card readers work. A practical shipping cost would make these card readers 5 stars"
2,No longer works after ~6 months,"I have loved the blueproton mircoSD reader up until today because it no longer works. I have been storing it in a watertight pill container keychain and it looks brand new with no superficial damage. I have been using it along with a 32gb microSD card (the SD card works fine in my cell phone). I was using it last night with no issues, but now when I put it into my USB port I get nothing. The USB ports are fine, so it must be the reader."
5,Works Great,Arrived on time and works great! :) it actually arrived early & its pretty fast i'd recommmend it. real easy for transferring stuff from computer to phone & vice versa.
1,Save your money!,"I should have listened to others reviewers. This thing is a piece of junk. Absolutely would not work with a SanDisk Micro installed. To be sure, I plugged the Micro into the SanDisk card Adapter than came with the package and it worked just fine as a card."
2,Wont hold up to continuous use,"I bought this item and used it approximately two times a week.I loved it at first for how small and easily transportable it was.However, it turned out to be too flimsy.I used it to switch the MicroSD card back and forth between my cell phone and laptop.After about two months, the small plastic part that keeps the card in place broke off. I continued to use it by holding the broken portion in place while inserting the card into the USB drive of my laptop but ultimately, the broken part was lost and the entire thing is now useless."
2,"Works fine enough, lemon verbena smell is not one that I like.","This works pretty good, I usually make my own cleaner by thought I'd get a ""treat"" to make cleaning a little more interesting. I think the lemon verbena smell is terrible. I know this is personal preference but just thought I'd share. I LOVE to use lavender and tea tree oil when cleaning...I don't even mind the smell of vinegar with tea tree oil in it...but this stuff smells like ""old lady"" perfume to me. The lingering smell is too much for me. I should have stuck to what I love and ordered it in lavender."
2,not so green,"2.0 out of 5 stars not so green, March 12, 2008By Jakob OasI always thought these products looked the part of clean and natural, until they showed up in my house.They are very fragrance heavy, and being a person slightly sensitive to fragrance I started to notice it would make me a bit flushed and headachy. The countertop cleaner really bothered me most of all, because it would be on my food eating and prepping surfaces.The more I was around it the more it bothered me. I would even say it was overwhelming on my table while I ate and the fragrance got into the food when I used it on my butcher block.My wife also got the hand soap and having just used it I found that it too caused me some flushed feeling. So I decided I should share my experience. I have never written a product review before, but I've decided I find the claim of natural and ""green"" to be a bit misleading. These products truly bother me where most other average products do not, be they green or conventional."
2,The smell is not for everyone,"I just broke down and rinsed my counter with water, and thought I should note that the smell of this product is very, very strong (""aromatherapy"" indeed) and not to my liking at all. I cleaned my countertop with a few squirts of this spray several hours ago, and the smell was overpowering! It was like I had spilled an entire bottle of perfume (not good perfume, either -- more like eau de grandma). I opened the windows and kept hoping it would go away, but every time I walked by my kitchen that gag-inducing odor was still thick in the air.As counter spray, it does just what it ought to, but you may want to give it a sniff in the store before you buy it."
1,Aggravates asthma?,"My housekeeper, who has worked for me for 3 years, says Mrs. meyer's effects her asthma. I have used many other 'eco-freindly' products in the past which has not caused a problem. I recommend not using this product. I thought it was a superior ALL NATURAL product since it was sold in WF. After purchasing another of Mrs. Meyer's products, my wife complained about a metallic taste left in her mouth. I did some research and found they use artificial fragrance. Is this what is causing the issues in my home? I would not purchase again."
5,Lovely Scent - Clean Counters,"I find the scent pleasant. It's strong, but freshens the whole area where I cleaned. But most importantly, it got the job done - the counters came clean, even the stuff dried on. I chose it because of the harmless ingredients in it and now want to try other Mrs. Meyers products. I can't believe I can get things this clean without dangerous chemicals!"
2,VERY strong scent,I bought this product because I needed a cleaner that would be easier to use than my natural lemon juice-vinegar-baking soda homemade mixtures. I was looking for a cleaner that was gentle on people and the enviornment and settled on this one. Although it's a counter top cleaner I first tried it on the sink and tub in a small bathroom. The scent/fumes were overwhelming and I had to open the window and step out of the room. Today I tried using it on my kitchen counters and again I found the scent much too strong. I gave it two stars because it cleaned pretty well but I can't use it again. If you're sensitive to strong scents or fumes you might want to try another product.
2,Strong Smell,I was looking forward to trying this because I love the smell of lavender. Unfortunately the scent is overpowering. It's way to strong. I'm glad I only tried it on one countertop because I'm sure I would have a headache if I had cleaned the entire kitchen. I will be returning this.
3,Use Before You Go To Bed,"I think I'm just sensitive to smells. Well, my whole family is apparently. Because although I like the cleaning power of this spray, the scent is completely over the top in my opinion. Now when my kids see me taking this out of the closet, they actually beg me not to use it until they go to another floor. I now have to use this spray at night before bed or right before I am about to leave the house, so the smell can go away before we return. I think they meant well, and I know some people really love the smell of lavender. Me too, but not so my nasal passages feel like their is lavender IN MY NOSE!"
5,Awesome product,"I love this product. My daughter first discovered it and gave me a bottle of Basil scent. It makes my kitchen smell wonderful for hours after using it. Bristol Farms sells this for $5 per bottle plus tax, so Amazon's price is a much better deal. The three scents I love are Basil, Lavender and Geranium."
2,Strong Geranium Smell,"I've used the Lavender spray for years and love it. I tried the Geranium and it is much stronger, too strong for me. Too bad I bought a six pack before realizing I didn't like the scent!"
2,Headache,I really really wanted to like this and tried it tonight on my Corian - left the Corian streaky and SUCH A STRONG SMELL. Ugh! Back to Lysol kitchen spray.
2,Probably good for beginners,"What I received was not what I had been expecting. As someone who already has a basis with the MBTI, this book was overly simplified for my tastes: too short, filled with figures and tables. Even the simplified explanation that it put forth seemed rather confusing as I flipped through it and I already understand much of the MBTI. It was not at all the bent I was looking for. I think there are better explanations included on the free online tests you can take."
3,left wanting more info,"This book is pretty good, but if you really want to know how to tie dye and get really bright results, this is not the book for you...I was expecting some secret techniques for how to get the bright rainbow variations, how to keep the white areas white during a rinse and first wash...reviews of some dyes out there...and I didn't feel this book covered that area too well....butThe folding instructions are great!easy to follow and I got some amazing results...I was just frustrated with the actual dyeing recipes and techniques, I needed more detail in that dept.but all in allthis is a pretty good intro to tye dyeing book!"
2,tie dye book,"wasn't what I expectedI needed a book telling me how to mix up dye colors andto tie the item for dying .this book told more about the history of tie dyingand the authors history of tie dying,than actually giving information on how to do it"
3,Not too great.,"I'm a beginner and I honestly got more information off of one internet site than I did in this book. It's okay, but not great."
5,Love this tie dye book,Book is very detailed and shows some really nice patterns. It would be a good book for beginners and group events. It is great.
1,How to make a bad tie-dye,"This book gives basic info, no great gift of knowledge. This book was created so an old ""hippie"" could keep profiting off her craft. She does not really want you to be able to create good tie-dye and leaves out key important information in this book. There was never a 2nd book because she did not want people to learn how to make tie-dye good enough to sell."
3,"Respectable effort, but lacks (vocal) complexity","I love bossa nova, and I appreciate this album for not regurgitating the same old standards we all know (and love).However I am not completely satisfied with the music. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it sounds a bit too simple and childish. I am not sure if it's the melodies or the singer's voice. If you compare her voice to Astrud Gilberto, it lacks that hint of raspiness that gives Astrud's voice its warmth and sincerity."
5,6 Stars,"This CD is Fabulous. I copy all my CD's to my computer and listen to them from there, so I can delete the ones I don't like and just listen to the good stuff. Well, I kept 11 tracks which by any standards is a masterpiece. This CD has my highest recommendations. This version has 13 tracks, the additional track ""Canto de Ossanha"" is first rate. I deleted Mais and Samba Novo."
5,One of the best kept secrets of American Literature!,"I've often thought that Thurber doesn't get the credit today that he deserves as a writer. This is probably because his works are not ""deep"" in terms of meaning or content. His mastery of language, though,is superb, and his stories are some of the most hilarious and best written I have ever read. I can read many of them over and over and still laugh out loud! His cartoons are clever as well. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in humor and 20th century American literature."
1,Hope you like your roommates...,"Because this product requires me to shower with a friend... and not even in a fun way.The tension in the cartridge is weaker than the Moen's. This causes the weight of the shower head nozzle to drift downward/ not stay in place while taking a shower. And it moves pretty quick.After trying two of these with no change in results, I just ordered a Moen replacement cartridge instead. Until it arrives, me and my wife switch off holding the shower handle in place while the other quickly prepares for the day. When the wife sneezed in the shower this morning, I was treated with scalding hot water across the body.Unless you're looking for an unpleasant way to lure your roommate into the shower with you, I'd spend the few extra bucks."
2,Buy the Moen one instead,"We bought this less than a year ago. The o-ring broke that soon! Buy the genuine Moen one instead. The Moen one is easier to install (fits better, requires less force to install), easier to turn on/off, and easier to turn to adjust temperature."
2,"Tango is joy, tango is live, tango is fan...","These tangos are modern.These tangos are sad.Borges judged tangos as weeping, melancholic, and regretful, but it was HIS opinion, blind, bachelor, and big-mouthed. Regretfully all right, Argentinians accepted it, because it was THE Jorge Luis, ho, ho, ho! And we follow.Can you believe, musicians, bend all over trying desperately to play ""sad"" tangos! Fools!And dancers, struggle to put suffering faces, to theatrically ""perform"" tango. Fake! When the true is, tango is feeling, concentration in your partner's fluency, aplomb, and glow, and you, derive pleasure (and praise) from there.If you hear, and grasp, tangos before the '50s, ""lunfardo tangos"" are called, you are going to dance, spin, and laugh, at life, romance, hardships, and be happy, uplifted, and very satisfied, with you, your life and your-self. Try."
3,Traditional,"Traditional tango, lots of male vocals. I expected something more upbeat and modern like the Gotan Project."
5,Love It!,I am learning the tango and this CD is perfect introduction to the pantheon of tangueros! Excellent selections of tango standards and milonga favorites.
2,Boring,This music is boring. All tangos have the same tempo. No milongas. What a shame! Trying to do routines to this music would be a waste of time. This CD sounds like background music in a lounge.
1,On star is too much,"Alan Grant went to Stanford?You'd think that a Stanford grad would be a little bit more literate than, ""he got his drink on"".All through the book, I'm thinking, ""Is Grant related to Willingham?""If you really want to read the book, go to your library. If you actually buy it, you will feel like you've been on a date with a prostitute. Used and abused.There's a reason that this book is rated below 2 millionth on Amazon! In fact, I think they only have a million books listed, this happens to be twice worst thann the best."
1,What glory?,"Considering Willingham was just fired, I can't recommend this book. Sounds like the glory was an illusion."
5,Great Book on the PLO,"One of the greatest books describing the PLO I have ever read. Livingstone and Halevy make the book incredibly easy to read and understand. The book is an indepth look at the most formidable terrorist organization in the world. Although the book is out of print and slighlty out of date (1990), it is still on of the best works to date. Definitely worth combing the used book stores for!"
1,Look elsewhere,This books is awful. The SNMP tools provided on the CDROM do not load up properly. The source code does not address anything new or clever that you can't get from the MSDN. Save yourself the trouble of returning it (look elsewhere).
1,Tastes disgusting,"Terrible. DO NOT RECOMMEND. I've had a number of protein bars and I don't know what people who say these taste great are eating, because they are terrible. If you want a good protein bar, go with PURE Protein. You can get the peanut butter ones with 33g of protein and they taste fantastic, almost like a candy bar. DO NOT BUY THESE."
4,Mrs. Pepper has a nice Mother's Day,"How could you not have a nice Mother's Day when you live with this thoughtful and kind group of Blue's friends? They're all here -- Mr. Salt, Paprika, Blue, Magenta, Periwinkle, Slippery Soap, Tickety Tock, Mailbox and Steve -- and everyone finds a way to make Mrs. Pepper feel appreciated and special on her first Mother's Day. Nice themed book for Blue's fans."
4,It is a well-written book.,"The book is well-written, in general. It tells the whole story: from the beginning, motivation to the way of solving problem."
5,The only book you will ever need for WC,This book is quite dated(about 6 years now) but still it covers the fundamentals of wireless communications quite strongly. relevant mathetical derivations are provided to calculate fading and diversity. MIMO coverage though a bit outdated is quite strong and explained very legibly.overall the best book in fundamentals of wireless communications. 5 Stars.my advice: read this book as a Foundation Base and once completed then go onto the read the additional recent developments in wireless industry. This book will serve as a strong foundational base for Wireless comm.
2,a little immature,"The authors are strong in Information theory, but very weak in Random processes.The chapter 3 on The Wireless Channel is very immature. While explaining time and frequency coherence, they show an equation with a factor of 4 in the denominator and then later say in the following text- 'many people use a factor 1 instead of 4, the important thing is to recognize that ....the relationship is reciprocal '.Furthermore, the authors do not understand the theoretical implications of an underspread channel. A statement in the book reads:'This is the so called underspread channel'with no further explanation.I don't expect this description from a UC Berkeley or UI Urbana Champaign faculty. A solid joint time frequency analysis of the wireless channel is missing.A lot of mathematics is presented in the chapters on MIMO. An intuitive presentation of the MIMO channel using fundamental random processes is still missing."
1,This movie owes stars.,"This could be the worst movie I've seen in years. Total waste of a good blank dvd disk. No one in the movie can act. The special effects are a true joke consedering the technology available today. Talk about low budget. I'm embarrassed to say I actually threw away money to buy this truly horrible sequel to a decent but also not very good origional movie. SAVE YOUR MONEY. If you must,it will probably be on cable next week for free. I can't see it even going pay per view...."
2,Some good....lots of bad,"First of all they picked a non-interesting baby face actor to be themajor character...oh my ...The bad guy was ok but sounds like he needs more acting roles by the way he delivered his line... the bad witch or whatever...too cute....And now for the good stuff....At one point the movie resembled a swordand sandal quest movies that was popular in the 1960's... the desertland of the dead scenario was the best. The other surprise was the actor that portrayed the scribe /writer in this movie...Reminded me of a young Roddy McDowall character from Alladin movies to the planet of the apes movies.So the 2 stars are for the Bad guy, the scribe and the limited budget special effect personel.Rent it....dont buy it"
3,;0/,It was ok of course the original was better with The ROC. This one more focus on him growing up and how the scorpion king came about I think it was missing something and could have done much better. With saying that it wasn't that bad that it's not watchable. And the bad guy they could have done wayyyyyyyyyyyy better with him.
2,Must be a dedicated fan,"Not very good. Certainly does not live up to the quality and adventure of its predecessors. Best to rent and view it, then decide if you want to buy it."
2,"Not great, but not too awful","This was definitely not the worst movie of the year, though it certainly hovers near the bottom of the list.That being said, it was better than Indiana Jones Crystal Skulls, and even better than the most recent installment of Narnia: Prince Caspian. So I can't be too harsh, given it had a fraction of the budget of those other films.It had some decent special effects (the underworld, the battle scenes), but other effects (the scorpion, the minotaur) were simply awful. And yes, the acting was pretty bad.Enough said about this movie. If you like B-movies, if you're really into the Scorpion King/Mummy franchise, if you're into cheesy, then you'll like it. If not, it might be best to avoid. (2.5 stars)"
3,The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior,"Everything is good in the film, not bad and not perfect. Nothing special about this flick, but I did find it enjoyable. Nothing spectacular either."
1,"bad movie, not even worthy of renting it","Bad movie, not even worthy of renting it. This prequel to 2002's The Scorpion King has nothing to do with the first one. Bad plot, cheap production. unreasonable scenes through out."
1,Don't Bother,"Rented the movie, watched it...barely. HORRIBLE acting except for the poet and the Chinese character. Extremely weak story line. Wasn't even worth renting. Would have given it zero stars if I could."
3,An OK movie,"Not as good as the original. In fact, other than some of the names it doesn't seem to have a lot to do with the original. I think the movie had a few good moments but only of you tried not to think about it too much. There is some kind of weird theology going on here. I'm not sure if I want to watch #3..."
3,"A Young Conan Film, Actually","The Scorpion King 2 really plays out more like a film about young Conan (with a different name, obviously) than anything that has to do with the previous Mummy and Scorpion King movies. I could detect almost nothing having to do with Egypt in the film; the lead character could just as easily have been in Conan's Hyborian world.The entire film is very similar in theme to the first season of Spartacus, except that Spartacus was extremely well written and executed.Scorpion King 2 is watchable, though --- not so entirely awful IMHO as proclaimed in many of the Amazon reviews for this picture."
3,Scorpion King2,Movie was a little cheesey in some parts and other parts were made well.Could have had better acting in some of the parts.
3,movie,"The movie was okay, but it would have been better if the Rock was in The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior."
1,Run don't walk to rent Starship Troopers 82 instead,"I caught a screener of this. Wow this was bad. What do you get when you have the greatest Mixed Martial Arts fighter in history (Randy Couture) fight the Blue Power Ranger (Michael Copon)? The Blue Power Ranger??????You get a mess. Shame on the film makers. No wonder ""the Rock"" didn't want any part of this straight to DVD trash. It's the same old ""you killed my daddy, now I'm gonna kill you (After I go to the underworld and get the secret sword that is the only means to kill you)"" garbage storyline you have seen a million times.The special effects are ok that's why I'm giving it one star.Now I'm going to go wash my eyes out with kerosene."
1,I want my money back.,"Wow. This movie has earned its place right near the top of my ""stupidest movies I have ever seen"" list. Lousy screenwriting, corny scripts, cheap effects, and horrid acting. All through the movie I became more and more disgusted, and then the end credits came and I saw that this film was made in 2008! One would expect much more of such a recent work. Totally not up to par with modern movies--maybe more like 1990. I must admit that Michael Copon did an amazing job, however. If it weren't for him, this movie would have been an absolute bust. If it's on TV, feel free to watch it--but NEVER pay money to see it!"
2,Scorpion King: The Beginning!!!,"When I heard about a sequel to The Scorpion King, I wanted to see it. I bought this with Prom Night and The Wizard of Gore remake. I thought it was just alright, but something confused the crap out of me! Mathayus's brother died in the first one, but this one takes place before the original, and his brother dies in this one. Unless he had two brothers, that did not make sense. Other than that, the storyline was okay. Mathayus wants to avenge his father's death, so he trains for six years. When he comes back, the man who killed hid dad became king. Later, Mathayus and his girlfriend Layla end up in the Underworld. There are some funny moments, but it's still not as good as the original Scorpion King! I probably wouldn't recommend THE SCORPION KING 2: RISE OF A WARRIOR!!!"
1,Crappy movie,"Poor graphics, the characters didn't stand out.The action never seemed to reach you and the acting and entire movie for that fact is what you would find in a really really low budgeted film.Not worth seeing, even if you are a fan of the first installment or Mummy francise."
3,Everyone who bashes this movie needs to have there head checked.,The reason people bash this movie. Is because they saw the movie with the rock. And said if it dont have the rock i aint gonna like it.granted it aint the best movie. But u could do worse i mean come on all iam saying like it for what it is not what u think it should be.
1,More stupid direct to video releases from NBC Universal.,Do not let the title fool you. The Rock is not in this movie. It was just some garbage Universal tried to turn into a movie(which is not even a real movie). It looks like real trash.
3,Scorpion King 2,"I was not happy with this move..........it was a boring attempt to remake another ""rock"" movie without ""rock"""
2,Boring sword and sorcery,"A young warrior (Michael Copon) gets on the bad side of a powerful king (Randy Couture) who has allied himself with the forces of darkness.This is a tired, dull Conan lite wannabe with poor performances, lackluster effects, and a clichéd screenplay. Other than that, it's pretty good. Couture would make a good Marine drill sergeant, but he does not inhabit the ancient world convincingly."
1,"Skip it, not even worth renting","I liked all the related movies, Mummy series and the first Scorpian King movie. Fortunately I only rented this movie. Had to give this a star, Amazon requirement. I can not remember much about the quality of the blu-ray picture or the sound, because the movie was not good enough to care about remembering anything about."
1,scorpion king 2,the product is ok the movie itself is a little lack luster but the product is just fine.
1,Horrible.,"The only relation this rubbish bears to the previous film is in the name. Bad script. Bad acting. Effects that are only slightly bearable. Such terrible fight scenes: slow motion does not make a good film, it only makes it longer. I couldn't finish watching this, and couldn't believe that anyone would sit through it long enough to read the credits. Avoid."
1,"Weak, Pathetic and I'm glad I rented it.....","This movie is awful. I would say is a Hallmark type production but that would be an insult to Hallmark movies which I enjoy occasionally.This is BAD, starting with the way it was produced, the acting, the story, pretty much everything. Damocles apparently died ""a thousand deaths"" by this magical sword that cuts through everything.... So much for the greek legend accuracy... Children that grow up watching these movies will end up incredibly dumb...To conclude, this movie is like a bad episode of Xena and that says a lot.P.S.: While overall OK, the BluRay transfer was pretty bad for the darker scenes, for example the Minotaur labyrinth."
2,King 2,"The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior (Full Screen)Low budget sequel, interesting, with lots of action."
3,TIME PASSING,"If you are bored and want to pass time , this is not a bad movie to watch and spend your time on."
1,Scorpion King 2,"This movie was a huge disappointment. There were a couple ok fight seens, but even that was lacking. The story line was poor taking place when Arcadian was a boy and on a mission of revenge for the death of his father that takes him into some spirit world. The Rock was not in this one, which was a huge disappointment for me to start with. To top that off, the acting was really bad, but the few women that were it in were barely dressed and nice to look at.If you liked the first two Mummy movies and the first Scorpoin King movie, you will probably not like this!!All and all, I wish I had more hands to give it a 4 thumbs down!"
5,Review of Scorpion King 2,This movie was ok. They really needed this movie to be the first of the two Scorpion King movies. Mainly because this movie was when the main character of both movies was young and told why and how he became the assassin and one of the last of his kind in the original movie.
5,real gipsy king,"This is very interesting CD for all those who know who is Saban Bajaramovic, as well for those who hear him for the first time. His singing is beautiful, with voice ranging from gipsy balads to strong gipsy dance songs. Also, selection of songs is great: includes some of famous gipsy songs. Most songs are in Roma language, except two songs in serbian/bosnian/croatian. Couple songs are performed in jazz style, which sounds great. One note: the booklet that comes with this CD is actually one from Mostar Sevdah Reunion project with bosnian sevdalinka songs. All the publisher did was to print different front page?! So, you woudn't find any information about Saban or texts of his songs. BTW, there is a legend that he was the first to promote Gipsy Kings as guests on his concerts 20 or more years ago. After that, they became world stars..."
5,Beautiful Balkan sounds,"This is closest in sound and feel to Mostar Sevdah Reunion, a beautiful album. This album is equally beautiful! Some of the best Balkan sounds I've heard."
1,WARNING: NOT As Durable As It Looks!!!,Impressed by the thick casing and heavy moulding over the connection housings I purchased the 3' version of this cable. BIG MISTAKE - the cable shorted out in the male-end housing; and this was during very light-duty use with no pulling/stretching/bending or undue force of any kind.Avoid.
1,Very poor sound quality,I was doing home network PC-to-PC communication with Ventrilo. I was getting crazy distortion on my headsets (Senn PC350s) with this cable. Another cable (not listed on amazon) of equal length was crystal clear. Buyer beware.
1,In stock = waiting on production,"I tried to buy these from MarginMart. After a week, they still had not sent it. After contacting them, they informed me that it would be sent after 16 days. This for an item ""in stock"". I contacted MarginMart. They did not contact me. I cancelled the order."
3,Good read until the end - [...],"Joey Goldman tries to escape the low level mafioso life he had in New York. Key West offers the paradise he is looking for, but not for long. Family ties and obligations follow Joey to the Keys. This book is a fun read. It is not a hard hitting crime novel or a true ""Who done it?"", but it offers a colorful description of the Keys that is not on the tourist maps. Anyone who has spent a lot time in Key West should appreciate this one. I was really enjoying the book until the end. A little more research into the mafia and/or gangs/ cartels may have led to a more plausible ending. Halfway through this novel I bought several books in the series. Based on the Florida Straights ending, I haven't read them. This was a fun and interesting novel that seemed to give up at the very end. If you want an escape to the Keys and don't mind an implausible ending, get this one. If you're a stickler for details, ""Forget about it."""
4,like shells on the beach,"This book reads like a mix between Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen. Its good, not great; fairly entertaining. What makes it an 8 instead of a 5 are the occasional gems of wisdom that read so incredibly true. Like shells on the beach, you're trotting along, enjoying the view, relaxing, and all of a sudden you come upon a paragraph that is so insightful, you just gotta say; ""yup, that's how it REALLY is."""
3,A man attempts to reorganize his life,"Joey is clearly in love--with his girlfriend, his father, his neighborhood--but he hasn't found a way to escape the bonds of that love. After breaking away, the past catches up with him and Joey is forced to do what he must have done anyway. By destroying the myths and exposing the virtues of his personality, Joey finally cuts loose and truly enters a new period of his life. Where Shames really excels, for me, is in bringing other parts of his backdrop to life and taking pleasure in the act of describing things. Having said that, I wonder whether Burt's shirts don't contain evidence of a personal fetish that Shames, the man, harbors. Look forward to reading a different book by the same author, over the Christmas break."
5,A perfect book,"I must have bought this book three separate times. I have to keep it on my shelves. It remains one of my favorites -- and my husband's too.As crime fiction writers go, Laurence Shames is in a league of his own. FLORIDA STRAITS pulses with humanity (John Steinbeck meets Elmore Leonard?) His characters are caught up in bigger-than-life situations, but they're all real people. The humor is real. Words like 'farcical' and 'romp' don't apply.If you're new to Laurence Shames, I suggest you start here. I think it's his best. Mangrove Squeeze, I'm sorry to say, I couldn't finish. The Naked Detective, I haven't read yet. The others, great, but this one outshines them.I love this book."
5,One book and I was hooked.,"This novel was the most thoroughly delightful read I have had in a long, long time. Laurence Shames infuses his characters with so much, well, character, that they are just begging to come to life. You're right there as the mob goons are talking with each other in the writer's mob-phonetically-correct spelling of ""whaddaya sayin?"" The characters are so well developed that you can't help but be drawn into their world. And it's such a quirky and interesting world that you have no desire to resist. This writer pulls off the strange mix of mob/mystery/comedy so deliciously that you'll want to come back for more. After reading ""Florida Straits"", I quickly read all of the Lawrence Shames books available. He is truly a joy to read. What a talent for writing. Another book, please, Laurence!"
4,"a lightweight, comedic crime caper in Key West; a fun read","'Florida Straits' by Laurence Shames sort of falls into the domain largely owned by Carl Hiaasen: funny crime stories set in southern Florida. However unlike Hiaasen Shames doesn't have any sort of political/social agenda. He simply goes for laughs, and by enlarge succeeds nicely.In 'Florida Straits' we have ""stoopid"" New Yorkers relocating to Key West. As part of their baggage comes their crime family heritage (read: mafia). Naturally some caper gets cooked up amongst the palm trees and, well, that's basically it. Shames does treat us, however, with some very funny characterizations. And he is compassionate with all the quirky folks who call Key West home. However I did find his stereotype of Italian descent New Yorkers to be a bit over the top, especially in making fun of their rather curious accent. It is one joke that he milked too hard and too often.Bottom line: a fun yet rather brainless poolside read."
3,Just Ok,"We saw this story as mainly about sexism, racism that sadly exists in Corporate America and our society. The ugly fact is ironically it exists not only external to our race but within as well. We liked how the character Anise was determined and persistant in not allowing the unjust deeds be perpetuated against her. Anise recieved good support from her 'so called' friends and her Mother. We felt that the ending lacked closure. The characters perhaps needed more exploration and depth - Mother, Frank. This story didn't touch us. Nothing in it that we could grab hold of unlike many other novels that we've read which provided endless dialogue for us and kept us thinking and talking well after we've read the last sentence."
1,"Not her best work, pure drudgery","I have read all of Ms. Roby's books. I was so excited to see this book and I just knew it was going to be worth the wait. While this book started out fairly interesting, this quickly changed. The pace was too slow. Too many details, not enough story. I found myself skipping to future chapters to see what was going to happen and to see if it was worth my time to finish this boring book. It wasn't. Once I read the end, it was not worth the effort to find out what led up to the conclusion.Don't waste your money. Borrow the book from a friend or check it out at the library."
2,Not a good read,"This is a poorly written book, and it has nothing to do with the treatment of race or gender in America. It has to do with this author's lack of skill.She repeatedly shows us the physical trappings of wealth in a cumbersome, awkward way. The way she writes of a ""shiny white Lexus"", a ""three story house"", and even ice cubes from a refrigerator's ""built-in dispenser"" seem like the writing of a pre-teen who has never actually seen any of these things, but imagines that they must be amazing.Others have mentioned the pacing. Much of this is due to bizarre details that add absolutely nothing to the story. Why do we need to know that she put on sweat pants and a matching t-shirt to get the mail? At times, she enumerates her character's every move: she opens the door, walks inside, turns around, closes the door, walks into the foyer. None of these details are useful in any way.In all, it's a useful way to eat up a few hours, but only if you enjoy trying to edit for the author."
2,I just was not feeling it.,"I just could not get into this book. I felt like Ms. Roby was trying to write about a topic that needs to be opened, but it just did not work. Maybe if the situations in this book would have been differnt I would have appreached this book more."
3,"It was just ""OK""","I have to say that I agree 100% with the reader from Oakland,CA. The beginning of the book let's you know what the issue is,and gives you a hint as to where it's leading but halfway through the book its the same thing just being repeated over and over to someone else. I kept asking myself now that we know what's bothering Anise what is she going to do about it. This was a very easy read. I've read all of Ms. Roby'sother books but this was certainly not her best."
1,Whose Reality?,"I've read all of Sister Roby's books and I would be remiss to say this one was comparable to any of her previous work. This was utter trash. Apart from my personal opinions on interracial relationships, the book didn't flow well and I've read creative writing stories by sixth graders that were better than this.The characters were weak, soap opera-ish and one-dimensional. I realize that sometimes fact is stranger than fiction, but come on...Who in their right mind (some of you know what I mean when I say ""right mind"") would run into the arms of a white man when their spouse has left them for a white person, goes to work everyday to be betrayed by white folks and then in the end is still pushed aside by said white man?Every page seemed to be a PSA for the Rainbow Coalition as well as justification and rationalization. If you're going to do it, at least do it well.Trash. Just trash."
2,Close...but no cigar....,"Having read many IR books, I must say that I was intrigued by the way KLR brought the problem of both internal and external racism in the world. I was enjoying the plot of discrimination at the workplace and even the feelings that the main character had vis-a-vis her husband leaving her for a white woman. However, I felt that her love affair with Frank Coletti was way too rushed to believe that her feelings were genuine. The ending seemed to be very rushed and left me with a much unfulfilled feeling. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because it builds up well. Other than that it's a big let down. Do not read this book unless you mind feeling frustrated at the end."
3,Needs a Sequel,This my first time reading a book from the author. The ending really surprised me and I must say I was very disappointed with how things turned out with Frank. Why spend so much time on developing their relationship and at the end she's hurt again. A sequel with a positive ending would be nice.It's good to have a positive ending because it gives people hope that not all men will treat them unkindly.Over all it was an easy and quick book to read. If you don't mind a negative ending then enjoy it!
5,A Taste of Reality,"All of Kimbrela Lawson Roby's books deal with real life issues and A Taste of Reality is no exception. The main character, Anise Miller, was a strong professional Black female faced with many obstacles - sexism, racism, failing marriage,... but the sister prevailed. She had tremendous patience with her husband, even though he didn't appreciate her. Her strong family ties sustained her during some of the darker times of her life. Without giving away the ending, it had an interesting twist, but that is typical of Ms. Roby's writing style. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't want to put it down until the last page!"
4,A Taste of Reality,"Anise's husband just ticked me off. I wanted her to be a littlemore difficult regarding her divorce. She did handle it the way a ""lady""should handle considering her circumstances. However, from a Christianpoint of view let the Lord fight your battle. From the sista girlperspective, it is on now. (smile)Frank, I found to be wishy washy he wanted her to confess her feelings inthe midst of all that she was dealing with and be sincere about them. Then,his ex pops out of no where and he is confused about his true feelings. Ohmy goodness!!!!I guess that old saying applies Men, can't live with em, can't kill em. HAHA!!!! So we are stuck with them.The plot of the story was very good. I really did enjoy it in between atear or two. Thanks again for the good read."
5,Great Read!!!!!!,"I read this book in a day. I just could not put it down. I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen. As African-American's we face all sorts of discrimination on a daily basis. But in corporate america it is much worst even when we are more qualified both professionally and educationally. I felt everything Anise was going through and the choices she made regarding her career.This book isn't filled with ""ghetto drama"", but the drama Anise has to face on a day to day basis. I highly recommend that you pick this book up, you will not be disappointed. I truly enjoyed every page."
2,What happened?,"I am really disappointed. Ms. Roby has been one of my favorite authors since she first came on the scene, and I have raved about her books from day one. Taste of Reality was so depressing, and the ending was virtually nonexistent. I read it in two days because I kept hoping it would get better, although it never did. I don't regret my purchase, I just wish she would have given us more of what I have come to expect, great writing and page turning plots. I hope she rebounds on the next time around..."
3,slow,"ok story line. Reads too slow. When I purchased the book, It was not my intention to purchase a book with a racism story line."
3,Undecided!!!!,"I've enjoyed previous books by Kimberla, but this one was quite different from the norm. Although it kept my attention, it's not her best. I look forward to reading more of her works."
2,not very enlightening,"This book could have easily been titled ""A Taste of The Repetitive"" cause the overstated plot was repeated over and over again. Initially early on the author states clearly what the issues are for the main character, so seemingly one would think that the plot would move quickly. However, this wasn't case and even half way through the novel the main character was still naively having the same dialogue about the same issues without moving towards any hint of a resolution. I grew increasingly fatigued by the single character narrative and the constant dialogue with the same characters about the same issues.It was as if Roby got stuck and didn't know how to move her main character, Anise, along. I do not recommend this book at all. Two-thirds through the book I simply gave it up. It wasn't stimulting and did little to keep me interested."
2,It DRAAAGGGED On,"A Taste of Reality was the 4th book which I read from Ms. Roby. After reading Casting the First Stone, As Good As It Gets, and It's a Thin Line, (all of which I would give 5 stars) I was disappointed with this book. Although Ms. Roby tackled some very important issues in the workplace the story line was very weak. It didn't immediately grab my attention and the book just seemed to have dragged on and on. I only continued reading after I got midway and decided to finish. It seems the main character with all her educational background was just too naive to things happening right in front of her face. I was also hoping/waiting that her husband get a ""A Taste of Reality"" as well."
2,It conveys its message...,"""A Taste of Reality"" is populated by puppet characters who beat you with the moral like mallets. Kimberla Lawson Roby has shown herself capable of better. Regardless, the moral is a worthy one and the story moves fast."
2,could have been better,"I am an avid fan and reader of all Kimberla Lawson Roby books, waited so long for this book and I was very disappointed in it. Story, I thought focused too much on racism,which I know still exists, just didn't expect the book to put so much of an emphasis on it, the ending was so corny, not much of a story at all. Overall I am so disappointed, wish I had borrowed this book from the library instead of purchasing it."
4,Good,The book i purchased cane fairly quick and was in good condition. I was very pleased with my purchase. Would recommend though that an actual picture of the product be posted.
5,The Farm,"After having visited Louis Bromfield's Malabar Farm near Mansfield, OH, I wanted to read one of the books that he had written. While reading this novel, I came to understand his love and drive toward holding on to the ""family farms"" and the important role they played in the lives and in the history of our country, as well as his acute interest in human nature. He was very adamant about saving the soil for future generations. A good read for those who love the land, history, and are interested in farming."
2,Product did not work out of the box,Product did not work out of the box. Had to order a replacement from the vendor. Chip was bad according to tech service.
5,Buy this album,"Would love to buy this album , i just love the style of the music and the words to every song. And it rock's my socks off"
5,Another Great CD from Judy,"Judy Collins 3 and 4 is the 9th album in my collection of Judy Collins music. I heard about it when I saw her in concert in April 2004. Both CD's are great listens because they not only showcase the many colors of Judy's voice but also her guitar playing which is always great to listen to. I enjoy the songs in The Judy Collins Concert because so many of them fall into the category of ""protest music."" They are all very meaningful and tell wonderful stories. Songs like Tear Down the walls,The Loansome Death of Hattie Carol,and Medgar Ever Lullaby really make you think of times long gone and how far we've come in society."
5,"rigorous, interesting examples, great software!","this book is one of a kind, among all the java books on the market. it breaks the java language into 5 (progressive) layers, and gives the abstract syntax, static semantic (type constraints), dynamic semantic (interpretation), and complitation rules of each layer. This approach is effective, mathematically rigorous, and believe or not, fun to read!as most of the PL books with formal flavor, the notations take some time to get use to. but the rewarding is worth the effort: you get a very clear picture of language itself. the examples are quite interesting, and the software on the CD does a superb job animating the intrepretation of java programs.all in all, a very good (academic) book, perfect for computer scientists or CS major graduate student interested in PL, but probably not for everyday programmers."
1,Plainly Boring,"It just shows an implementation for an old Java specification (I think JDK1 or JDK1.1) in a weird language called ASM. This ASM is simply a glorified programming language, even not one of the most advanced: haskell, for instance, is much more clearer. You /could/ think about it as a model for java but then it would be useless because of its intricacies and its gigantic size."
2,Letter from a ... ?,"Campolo has a long reputation in crying foul concerning the evangelical church in America. In Letters, if one gets past Campolo's ""Red Letter Christian"" agenda, there are some poignant observations. Favorite targets are the Southern Baptist Convention (role of women, non-Pentecostal orientation), and dispensationalism (end-times pessimism).Campolo displays the same animus towards ""Evangelicals"" as liberal/secular critics with a surprising lack of perspective for someone who is supposed to be in the loop. If the kingdom of God was truly manifesting itself (Campolo is a postmillenialist), then why is he so critical of the vast majority, and why are there so few ""Red Letter Christians"" (apparently this is a catchphrase he has come up with himself)? One can only conclude that folks with his view are solely responsible for the Kingdom's so-called advance. Having said that, his advocacy for social and environmental concerns should gain a wider audience."
5,Beautiful melodies,"My favorites are ""The Poet and I"" and ""Music Box Dancer"". Then I found others are pretty good too. This CD has 21 tracks. That's a bargain."
2,Explain yourself,"The comment by Benjamin Shobert (""I believe certain attachments to specific evangelical Christian ideas about inerrancy, infallibility and inspiration colored the last of the book, and as such, limited the poignancy of his conclusions."") stops short of being helpful.What does he mean by 'certain attachments to specific evangelical Christian ideas'? Are the ideas Bright is attached to in support of or in opposition to inerrancy, infallibility and inspiration of the Bible?If it is that Bright stands in support of those issues, then I will certainly be interested in his work. If however he is opposed to them, then I would not at all be interested, for I do not care to be reading 'Christian Evangelical' works on the Word of God that do not espouse precisely those issues.Since when is anyone qualified to comment on the bible who does not hold to its being precisely the Word of God?"
1,screwholes,"It is missing info on the screwhole distance. There are many different doors with different screwholes...mine is old and the distance is 3 1/2""..all the other handles on this site has that listed."
5,italianophile,"I have referred to this little book for many years. This explains many Italian terms and sayings that are not elaborated in the dictionary. These are terms such as ""pantera"" ( police car), which you see or hear in the news or ""pure"", a very Italian way of emphasizing an expression such as ""prendelo pure' which would be ""take it by all means"".I have two problems with this book. The quality of the binding is poor, so it falls apart. It avoids off color or obscene terms. People do use them."
3,"Yellowed pages, but readable.","It arrived eight days after the last date promised. In spite of the yellowed pages, the dictionary contains much that is of value."
2,Well acted.,Other than a powerful cast this movie was boring and felt distant with all of the characters. If you are a fan of McKellen and Suzman then watch.
2,Shank's are good but there's a much better one now available,"I'm thankful for the books Shank put out and they were somewhat useful for those who believe the Bible about the security of the believer rather than the Calvinistic ""perseverance of the saints."" But there's a better book out now: contemporary, exhaustive and irrefutable called ""The Believer's Conditional Security"" by Dan Corner. Write for more info."
1,One of the WORST books on eternal security ever written,"While it is clear from the Scriptures that eternal security is false, it is also clear that Shank is dangerously wrong. He too teaches a license to sin by writing, ""...spiritual death is the inevitable consequence of habitual sinning as a deliberate pattern of behavior"" (p. 144). There are other serious errors with Shank, even though he fought once saved always saved. I could NEVER recommend this book, because of multiple serious Scriptural errors. This is one of the WORST books against eternal security."
1,Illogical and deceptive,"The work is deceptive. Presentation of data has conclusions that are jumps in logic. Quotes given to support view against eternal security are deceptive. Reason? One must not use quotes from a person who does not support your view by passing them off as quotes that appear to be in support of your view.The Greek grammar appears to be solid, until one realizes that an incomplete view of grammar is given. Taking a rule of grammar and including only part of it to support one's view is deception.The work takes a more Catholic view to salvation, making it a process more than a one time event. The view taken is that of works salvation--one must do such and such and continue to do such and such over a period of time for salvation.As for the idea that perseverance of the saints = eternal security. That is also incorrect. The book is flawed from the very first.Not recomended. Appears to be good scholarship, but only appears as such."
5,Every Christian needs to read this book!!!,"This is an excellent book that examines eternal security (once saved, always saved). It examines the proof passages, and the warning passages. It examines scripture to see what it really means to be a believer."
3,Polarizer,"I have dealt with better filters in the past. It just so happens this filter works with the 2 cameras i have and no other. I like what it does, but it isnt as strong as what i have dealt with before. Still great quality and a great buy."
4,But I have a question,The VF-58CPKS kit including a PL filter and an UV filter is supposed to support 58mm camera such as F717.But in your introduction it's been changed to Wide angle and support the 37mm lens? Maybe it's a big mistake. Below is from Sony:Circular Polarizing Filter KitVF-58CPKSUse this circular polarizing filter to suppress unwanted reflections off glass and water and protects lens from dust and scratches at the same time. It fits a Sony 58 mm diameter lenses
5,A fine science fiction novel,"Published in 1970, Moonbase One chronicles the adventures of several young colonists on the lunar surface. It was written for the juvenile market but can be just as easily enjoyed by adults as well. Jones was an effective writer of sf who was able to convey often complex scientific ideas with authority and sufficent verve to hold the reader captivated. This enthralling tale makes for highly enjoyable and relaxing reading and is worth searching out, as are any of his other novels; This Island Earth, et al."
2,better than the MASH cover only because of more mixes,"Why there would be two dance covers of the same extremely annoying pop hit from the early 90s is beyond me. Both the MASH version and this version feature cheesy high-pitched female vocal. The only reason to get this single over that one is the wider variety of mixes, including a trippy house mix, electronica, pop trance, and a slightly harder mix that is ruined by the melody and vocals. If you want just one generic dance cover of this song, pass on the MASH version and get this one."
5,I loved the book because it is neat to follow a family.,"I loved this book. I read it after I had read ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" which is a book of the events before the events in this book. This is like a sequal to that. I loved them both and I wish there were a ton more books about this family. I think it would be a dream come true to meet some of them. It is so neat to read a whole families life story and it is even more fun to have such an interesting family as the Gilbreths. Sometimes I don't know how they lived. They are really neat people and they inspired me in the weirdest ways. I would recomend this book to everyone of any age. But first you should read ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" it is up to you but it is more fun to read it in order. I think you should give at least one of these books a try, they are great I think and they would make great gifts if you need a good gift, also. I hope you take my advise and read these books."
4,The Gilbreth Story continues,"Not as entertaining as the first installment of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", but still an enjoyable read.This is the continuing story of the Gilbreth family after Mr Gilbreth's death. This book focuses on the mother and how she manages her career, all the while continuing to be a patient, loving role model for her eleven children.A story from from a different era, but with inspiration for the modern women."
4,"My Book ""Revue""","Delivered as expected for such an old paperback but worth it to my ""esposo"" who had lost the origional paper back from ""way back"". Can't say more as it was not for me and I did not read it. But it made him happy so my expections were fulfilled."
1,"Piece of junk, worthless, don't bother","I bought one of these through another retailer, should have read the reviews at amazon first, they are 100% correct! This router stinks, doesn't work as advertised. While this is a wireless router that can do VPN at the same time, it turns out you can't do both at the same time without locking up the router. Very slow web interface, issues with LAN IP resolution, tech support is worthless.Wasted five hours trying to get working to no avail, no resoltuion to my probelm is availabel at this time. Might be a 'cheap' purchase price but costly in lost productivity and now i need to buy another model anyway and return this one.You've been warned, stay away!"
1,Firmware 1.0.29 .. still buggy - WARNING!!! SIP for VOIP doesn't work,"Had the unit up running with the latest firmware. Couldn't get it to work with the Motorola OJO video phone no matter what. Tried Port Forwarding, Port Triggering, DMZ, UPNP and nothing worked. Do NOT .. DO NOT get this router if you are planning to run SIP VOIP behind it, or until they fix it."
1,Very unstable,"The router has very good capabilites, but also the wrv200 has too many bugs. (lost of settings, lost of access to the web interface at random periods, etc. ) It seems very unstable.I read about similar problems from others owners of wrv200 in forums and message boards.I'm waiting from linksys a new firmware that addresses the problems, because It's unreliable to work in a production environment."
1,Not even sure it deserves one star,"I've owned several other linksys products and I've been pretty happy with them. So happy that I blindly ordered the WRV200 thinking that it had the features I need and it should just work as advertised ... I was wrong. I battled with it for a few days and boxed it until the new updated firmware came out. Unfortunately it's more of the same. If you want to save yourself some pain and frustration, look around for something else."
3,GOOD SQAURE DANCING BOOK!,"Fourty-four enjoyable square and folk dances for everyone. Music and the calls. Written by Miriam H Kirkell and Irma Schaffnit. Illustrated by Deirdre Baird. 129 pages. 10""x 8""."
5,baby gift,"Even though I am a NY Giants fan, I did give this baby jets gift for a present (father and mother are Jets fans) and they loved it. The used it right away when the baby came."
3,Alex,Good book but i would i have liked to see more depth and a variety of analysis on the X's and O's.
2,There are better choices...,"I fyou want to know about Sandy Koufax, there are better written books to choose from than this. While factually, there are interesting nuggets about the amazing pain and endurance that marked his career (300 innning seasons, 250 pitch 13 inning complete games with bone spurs and arthritis), this book was sorely in need of a qualified editor.I found the flashback style terribly distracting, as if the book was written while watching ""For the Love of the Game"". Also, Mr Gruver's tendency to state a point in his own voice, and follow it with identical quotes from 3 other people. Repetitive and unnecessary.The writer has had no input from Koufax, and as such is reiterating old interviews. there's nothing new here.So if you're new to the story, the factual info is all there, but there's got to be a better way to get a grip on it."
3,Were my expectations to high?,"I was really looking forward to this book. As a huge Koufax fan (though I'm a bit too young to have seen him pitch), and with past bios of him hard to find, I was excited about this book when I first read about it pre-release. Sadly to say, I was disappointed. I found very little of what I would call fresh material or insights. The book is written in a breezy, easy-reading style --but it is at the same time confusing. The transitions between present time and flashbacks are muddled so that the paragraphs just blend together. Also, there is much repetitiveness to this book, almost leading me to wonder if it was self-edited. I realize Koufax remains a privacy-seeker, but all the same I wish there would have been sone new material. From the book, it's unclear if Gruver even attempted to interview Koufax. Bottom line: if you are a Koufax fan, you'll want to add this to your collection. Just don't expect anything approaching perfection."
4,A VERY GOOD BOOK ABOUT THE GREATEST PITCHER I HAVE EVER SEEN,"THIS BOOK IS WELL TOLD ABOUT A VERY MODEST MAN. MR. KOUFAX PAID A PRICE FOR HIS GREATNESS, (ARTRITIIS). I WONDER WHAT KIND OF STATS HE WOULD HAVE IF HE COULD HAVE PITCHED 5 OR MORE YEARS. MR. GRUVER DOES A GREAT JOB COVERING THE CAREER OF THE BEST PITCHER I HAVE SEEN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO APPRECIATES A GREAT ATHLETE AND A VERY MODEST AND SENSATIVE MAN. THANK YOU SANDY FOR YOUR GREATNESS AND THANK YOU MR. GRUVER FOR A WELL WRITTEN STORY."
2,disappointed,"Disappointed, the last of the recording is of very poor quality. If they couldn't reproduce it any better than, best not to have put it on the market. Sorry I bought, but have kept it anyway. Maybe others wouldn't be s disappointed as I was."
4,Those Caissons go Rolling Along,"Anyone who played an instrument in their school marching band will be familiar with at least some of Sousa's marches. These are timeless military classics that will inspire the freedom loving patriot in all of us. This is not the best recording of his music. It sounds much like an old record being played on an AM radio, but then again, that was what recordings of this era sounded like. This is a great recording for any musical history buff to have in their collection. John Philip Sousa directing the Sousa Band!"
1,Not Sousa,"I'm not buying this CD. I don't believe Sousa ever recorded. It was members of his band most likely conducted by Pryor who did. Also, it was not the full instrumentation because of the limited space in the recording studio. Sousa was not in favor of ""canned"" music because of the negative effect it had on live music. Also, some of the tracks on this CD were not written by Sousa. There is an excellent series on Naxos by Keith Brion up to Volume 8 (and counting) which is recording not only marches, but other great Sousa compositions. Keith attempts to duplicate Sousa's actual performance technique as closely as possible."
5,Fabulous book...,"A clear and confident appreciation of the dynamics of the Reformation and the movement's effect on the private and personal life of thepeople of central Europe. The author reveals how ""Big Ideas"" touch the lives of everyday people, how ideas change how people live and order theirday to day life. Truly enlightening, authentic historical research and writing..."
4,Early Protestant family life as loving and liberating for all members,"Excellent historical study of marriage and family during the Reformation that combats the typical PC doctrine of university history departments (""the Reformation was oppressive to women!"") by bringing German and Swiss primary source documents to bear on the subject. In doing so, Ozment shows that Reformation family life was both loving and liberating to men, women, and children. Solidly academic, but with good storytelling and a provocative thesis. Highly recommended."
1,I don't get how this works,"Maybe I did something wrong, but the instructions were clear so I don't see how I could have. It just didn't work. The instructions clearly say not to put it in the frig or freezer. But that's the only way I can think it might actually work. Otherwise, it just doesn't stay cool"
1,not too pleased...,A little disappointed...this isn't staying cool and it keeps moving around and getting lumpy inside the pillow case. Am I doing something wrong that it doesnt' stay cool all night?
1,Please save your money,"Not only does the Chillow not stay cool for longer than 10 mins., it isn't comfortable. I put mine in the trash."
4,great product,great product. the pillow stays cool all night. I prefer a thicker pillow so I just stuck it in the same pillowcase as a thinner pillow that I have.
1,R. Elliott,Basically tasteless (even the dog didn't like them!). Took FOREVER to arrive. Amazon is not ready to handle food.
3,Same thing over and over...,"If I wasn't a Robotech fan, I would find this game rather boring. But, as a fan, it held my interest. It was much the same thing over and over again. I wish they could've varied the gameplay a little bit."
3,Nostalgic First Person Shooter,"Not the most extravagant first person shooter... But for a fan of the Robotech series, looking for nostalgic fun, I find the game quite enjoyable. Yes, there are games with better graphics, but the general action and story I think are more than acceptable."
1,Terrible,"This game is terrible, Robotech Battlecry was a better game than this. The visual quality was bad, the gameplay was uninspiring. I am a big Robotech Fan, watched it as a kid on TV, I own the TV series but this game doesn't live up to it. Its incredibly boring. If you are looking for a shooter move onto to anything else. If you want a Robotech Game buy Battlecry. Or watch the shows and use your imagination! You'd probably have a better time."
3,Average movie - Great soundtrack,Dancing with danger is your average B movie with one difference - it has a superb soundtrack. However there is no information included in the credits about who that beautiful voice is. I thought it was Roberta Flack but my wife was not sure. I can find no information on the internet about who it is either. So enjoy the soundtrack but do not expect to get a copy of it.
3,Dancing With Danger,After looking for this movie for so long and disappointingly not being able to locate it on dvd the next best thing is the VHS tape!! I was not disappointed by the storyline - Cheryl Ladd is a bit stiff in this but a lot of that is within the character she portrays - no interest in the opposite sex = no danger from the psycho!! All in all not too bad.
5,dancing with danger,VCR tape condition was better than stated. Plays very well. My order was received in a very timely manner also. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again.
2,Not up to snuff,"The exercises in the book might be great or they might just be some recycled Qigong moves. The author doesn't tell where he learned this or give any other information about its history. The instructions regarding breathing are sometimes confusing. The illustrations are small and the text sometimes leaves out instructions about when to keep moving your feet and hold your breath. I think that this guy is only interested in making money because now he travels around offering private instruction... If he didn't have exclusive dibs on a ""secret art,"" then he'd probably be back on the corner."
2,reviews to sell???,"well i've just started reading this book. I'm completely new to the field of Nei Gung/Chi Gung and such...while reading this book i came back on Amazon to read the reviews again to find what specifically in the book did each reviewer benefit from, and I accidently stumbled on this...all reviewers with 5 star rating have one review and that is for this book...having seen that I can only assume someone is keen on selling more of this book...that is sad...cause I've now lost half of my interest in this book however good it may eventually turn out to be."
2,Maybe not so secret! New agey stuff.,"The review system is somewhat mysterious to me. The best review on this book is ""Secret art??"" by a California reviewer. Nonetheless that review has a very poor feed-back. The reviewer said that this is Chi Gung and HE IS RIGHT! Just go get a couple of books about Chi Gung and see it for yourself. The author's claim that this is an UNIQUE art not are proven. The author says so but he doesn't prove it. The unique lineage he claims is not described at all. Author's claim that this is a 10000 years old art is ridiculous because the oldest writing records, the cuneiform, date back 5000 years. This having said, this is not a terribly bad book. If you you wrecked your body because of neglection, it may help you out. The author clearly knows about motivational arguments. The ninja-stuff art cover is really cool."
5,recommend to get it!,"Really recommend to get it for ur baby. I had been looking for some teething toy that it's washable!!! This is the one! For most of the teething blanket/stuff animal, it is not machine washable. (and you know how baby chew on it) And this one has different texture for baby to touch and chew, it is a good toy for infant!!!"
3,Not great but still,"I don't know what's up with these people, There probably TNA fanboys or people who want to banned violence. There's no such thing as wrestling scripts and people aren't too smart to face the facts. I know nothing about this PPV though, but still it's violent and real."
3,"Sad, but true","Sabu had animosity surrounding him backstage and was said to be uninterested at television tapings. Rumors evolved stating that WWE viewed Sabu as being ""useless"" in normal matches and that he could only perform in matches that included ""stunts and tables and they [WWE] don't respect him because of that"". This was reportedly part of the reason he had been scripted to be easily defeated by Umaga on an edition of Raw a few weeks earlier Vince McMahon wanted to put Holly in the match, so Lashley would have more villains to overcome. Heyman was legitimately unhappy with the decision, saying that Sabu's high-flying wrestling would be ""the ideal showcase"" inside the Extreme Elimination Chamber. The fans inside the James Brown Arena chanted ""bullshit"" during the segment."
1,ECW December To Not Remember for ECW,"I was in love with the Old ECW but not the WWE Verison. This is what vince wanted to do with ECW back in the 1990's. The Card was Horriable the only Good Thing about it is that Lashley won the ECW championship, The Hardy's and MNM had a great match but it was the lowest point for ECW if you get a good deal meaning $5.00 or less then buy it but this ppv was Horriable"
3,Results,i watched it...The Hardy Boyz beat MNMDaivari beat The Innovator of ViolenceBalls Mahoney beat Matt StrikerElijah Burke & Terkay beat F.B.IKevin Thorn and Ariel beat Mike Knox and Kelly Kellyand finally...Hardcore Holly and Rvd started off (Sabu was K.O. backstage)CM Punk came out of the pod with a chairTest came out with a crowbarRvd pinned CM PunkTest betrayed Hardcore Holly and pinned himTest pinned RvdNext was Lashley who broke threw the roof of his pod (had a table) because the ref was K.O.ed by HeymanLashley pinned TestBig Show came out of his pod with a barbed wire batLashley speared Big Show to capture the tiltleAftermath:Big Show apologized to Paul Heyman and they hugged...
3,"If you like ECW on Sci Fi, You will like this PPV","I have been a fan of ECW ever since ECW started airing in my hometown. I wasn't going into this PPV thinking I was going to see the old ECW. If you think that ECW is returning then you better stop watching. This PPV was just a 2 and a half hour version of ECW on SciFi. If anybody remembers WCW PPV's towards the end, this is better than that. This DVD is worth buying if you are a loyal fan of ECW. Special Features on this DVD are post match interviews with all 6 men from the Chamber. Also you will see the rematch between Big Show & Lashley for the ECW World Title on 12/5/06."
1,I wish I could of given this 0 stars. Thats how bad it is,I ordered this PPV and this maybe the last WWE PPV I ever order. This has to be one of the worst PPV's I ever seen in my life. No matches had any real build up. The EMC was a joke how do you let CM Punk and RVD get eliminated and let Lashley of all people win the title??? FBI jobs out to a team noone even heard of. The only match that was worth a damn was the Hardy vs MNM. Sabu getting replaced with Hardcore Holly was horsecrap. I think its time everyone boycotts WWE. Seriously this crap they are putting on tv week after week. Is getting really tired. Its seriously a joke anymore. Vince done all of this on purpose. Brought back ECW so he can kill it. If you want to watch a quality promotion. Watch Ring of Honor you will get your moneys worth. All and all avoid this PPV at all cost. Worst PPV of the year hands down.
1,boy cot show wwe you are tired of him destroying the soprt of wrestling i love,i all most ordered this peice of crap instead i got tna genies once i hreard joe v.s angle now i know that match dident live to the hype but the second and thired a 30 minet iron man match did and will and genies was by far better than enything wwe has put outthe only thing vkm cares about is money and his ego stop watching the show the ppv the tee everything let him know you wont take it that you want a good prodect and not what we are being force fed watch tna or ring of honor wrestling fans there still is wrestling for true wrestling fans
3,Predictions,I rated this a 3 star because I think everyone will cheat or the crowd favorite will lose kind of like summerslam of 2006I think this will be the PPV that Big Shiw loses his title.Big Show vs. RVDI think This will be another crowd pleaser and have some cool things in it. I do not like RVD but he can put on a show.I think the war of the good and the bad will end hereTest & Holly vs. Sandman & DreamerI'm pretty sure sandman & Dreamer will win because the good side always prevailsI think this will be the PPV where they bring back ythe ECW Tag Team Titles but I'm not sure who will contend for it yetI think they will bring back the ECW Television Championship here too.I'm not sure who will contend for this either.
1,Total Junk - Not worth 5 cents!,"I don't know how to begin describing what a total waste of time and money this product is. First, the games require that you set your display to 256 colors. This is 1989 technology and it shows. The dictionary has at most maybe 100 words in it and it's just an plain text list that pops up, not even a real dictionary. The pronunciation guide is a dirt simple text paragraph about long and short vowel sounds, it has nothing to do with how to pronounce any single word.This program is total trash. I'd be embarrassed to give it away. Either the producers at Simon & Schuster never even looked at this product or they don't care how they get your money. I'm astonished that any responsible manager would let something this awful onto the market bearing the company name. I'll sure never buy anything released by Simon & Schuster after this."
3,"Good bench, but missing parts","This bench is very adequate for an easier time in the shower, and the chair back is great. My bench came without the rubber feet and it has taken this company over a month to get them to me.....still haven't received them yet! Other than that, it is a good bench."
2,Initial rating 5 star,I have been using this item for almost 3 months and soon will have no need for it further. Initially I was very pleased as the seat allows one in a cast to be able to take a shower with the use of a shower cap for the cast. The frame of the item is sturdy enough but the plastic seat is of poor quality and is deteriorating with continued use. If I had to use it for another 3 months I do not believe it would make it. the price was very attractive but sometimes you do get what you pay for. Important point is that I weigh 225lbs. If you weigh considerably less I believe it would hold up much better.
5,Excellent quality,"Although I have not used the transfer bench yet, I feel it is of excellent quality and I am anxious to try it after my upcoming surgery.The price was very reasonable, and it feels sturdy.We bought this particular product, as we have a walker and transport wheelchair that were from Medline Industries, and we are very happy with both of them. We expect the same excellent quality with the bath bench."
3,Transfer bench,"Sent it back, to long, Need something that handle can go on either side, and seat not so long. Still looking. With tub we have now my husband has to sit with back to shower nozzle so he has enough room to get in."
5,Like an extra pair of hands,I am looking forward to using this bench when my husband comes home from rehab. I have every confidence it is just what we need. It has been recommended by various therapists.
3,DISAPPOINTED IN CUSTOMER SERVICE,"MEDLINE SHOWER/BATH TRANSFER BENCH FROM AMAZON.COMLooks fine but was too big for my bathroom. The box was so badly damaged I was unable to use it for a return. I contacted the company and they said they didn't supply boxes in which to return items and that I should find one. I'm 75 years old and I can't do that.So, I am stuck with something I can't use and, so far, haven't been able to give away! Such a waste of money...and such a shame."
1,designed by clueless,"Once-able people are not enured to the junk our forever-disabled comrades are.I am so sorry.This piece of junk is not well designed, and difficult for others to move out of the way.I should have known the clueless physical and occupational therapists read a magazine ad, once."
5,A lifesaver,"I recently suffered a badly broken left leg which made entering and standing up in the shower/tub impossible. The shower chair was a lifesaver - very sturdy and easily adjustable for the different height between the bathroom floor and tub.The unit is very secure with the oversized suction cups on the feet, and I have had no problems with the chair slipping or moving unexpectedly.Great product and excellent company.Five stars plus"
3,Not as sturdy as it should be,"As long as the individual using the transfer bench is able to help themselves, it should be OK. We bought it for my brother who had a stroke and is very limited on his right side. The bench is not sturdy enough for his requirements."
5,Saved my back!,Great product. Very sturdy. My son is 88 lbs and it does not budge. Best thing I have bought in a while. My son transfers from his wheelchair right onto the chair. Highly recommend.
5,As good or better than described.,"Delivery was seamless and quick. Product was easy to put together and functioned well for my father's needs. Once he was healed, it was donated to the local assisted living home and they were happy to have it. Sturdy and safe."
1,Damage Merchandise,"When the box was delivered, we should have refused delivery as it was torn. One of the legs was actually exposed. Upon assembly we found that that leg was bent the the device would not sit evenly. We immediately called the shipper and left a message. Further communication with Amazon and the shipper have resulted in no action. When we disputed the charge on the Amazon Chase credit card we were informed that it may take up to a year to resolve and we need to keep the bench. This is not a very good reflection on the quality of the vendors that Amazon chooses to include in their web site.VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE WHOLE MANNER THAT THIS HAS BEEN HANDLED!"
5,Great price and Safe!!,This product was found elsewhere at double the price for the same thing!! I can safely get into the tub now and actually wash my own feet!! Don't know how I did it before I got this transfer bench!!!link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JWM7LE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,So helpful!,"Ordered this for my aunt who broke her kneecap and cannot bend her leg. This is a lifesaver! Extended width allows for her to sit and ""scoot"" over with ensured stability. They had tried regular shower chairs (not the extended bench) and returned the chairs as they did not work."
4,A very helpful and safe product,I purchased this transfer bench for my elderly parents who were having trouble getting in and out of the bath tub. Their PT recommended getting a transfer bench. Those at the medical equipment stores are much more expensive
5,Very good product,"The bench was a snap to assemble. It is large, well-built and substantial. I don't worry about it failing. Recommended."
3,Short stories about an interesting pilot,"Pirx the pilot is not Tom Cruise from Top Gun, he's not an astronaut cut from the same cloth as NASA alumni, he's a pilot cadet at first taking his qualification exams and has some pretty interesting tests and assignments. I wonder how much of the 1970s vibe really translates well to today's reader, but nothing there really makes the story elements any less interesting."
5,subversive science fiction,one of his many social satires and critiquesmasquerading as science fiction! superb!
3,Not for the Feng Shui Beginner,"This book takes the reader beyond standard Feng Shui into Black Sect Feng Shui, which tends to use the Feng Shui concepts in a looser manner than traditional Feng Shui. If you're interested in internalizing Feng Shui as a lifestyle and spiritual undertaking, this book is good. If you want to know how to organize your home or office to improve balance and organization using Feng Shui concepts, and to see good examples, there are better books out there."
4,What Color Is Your Swimming Pool?,"This is a good book if you need to know the basics about a pool. But it's not real technical, it did not provide enough information no how to get or keep the chemicals correct in the pool. But if you're like me and did not know anything about your pool it is a very good starter guide for you."
2,Not what the title promised,"I was looking for a guide to restoring and mainaining a pool. This is just lots of pretty pictures of other people pools with no real information. Fine if you are looking for ideas on a new pool, but not what the title and descriptions say."
4,swimming pool maintenance,"This book would be really good to read BEFORE you put in a pool or a hot tub. Details about different types of pumps, covers, heaters etc. I was loooking for troubleshooting and more information than I was getting at the pool supply store. I think it is a good book for basic chemical imbalances and pool maintenance."
4,Excellent book for beginners,This book explained a lot of the things I did not understand about swimming pools. The only problem is that it seems a little dated.
2,Not thrilled,I wasn't completely thrilled with this product but it wasn't very expensive. I would like to have a adapter for electricity with it.
5,Good and Informative,This book has alot of information in it about Texas which is good considering that is the title of the book. If you need a book for those that have never been to Texas and want to know of some places to go and see and want alittle bit of history on the area then this book is what you need. Even those people who are from Texas like myself can benefit from it cause lets face it Texas is a big state and even the people that live in it don't know everything there is to know about the state or where things are located. All around the book was very helpful for not only me but the friend I bought it for. Now she wants to go visit Texas very badly. haha!
3,the guitar song everyone is looking for,"the guitar song everyone is looking for isfrom moby's ""play"" album: everloving."
1,Completely Forgettable,"Nice orchestrations, completely forgettable score. Listened to it first time while on a long trip. Terrible. Should have let brother Thomas have this one."
2,Missing a song,"Disappointed that this collection doesn't contain the song ""If I Had A Million Dollars"", which was heard briefly during the movie & played again near the end of the closing credits."
4,missing the thing I bought it for...,"This CD is full of absolutely beautiful music, but I'm thinking about returning it because it does not contain the song I bought it for. There's a guitar segment near the end of the movie that really caught my attention. Whatever it is, it's not included on the movie's soundtrack. For that only, I was extremely disappointed."
2,Missing tune on soundtrack,"The guitar segment near the end of the movie greatly resembles ""Far Away"" a song perormed by Marty Stuart and used in the movie ""All the Pretty Horses""."
4,"help, i beg.",Does anyone know the title of the song being played in the Seabiscuit trailer still in theatres? It's one of the most moving pieces I have ever heard - and I'd love to know where to get it. Thank you.
3,Re: crescendo swell,"I believe that the theme that you're referring to is the main theme from the video game ""Medal of Honor"", and could be found on the ""Medal of Honor"" soundtrack."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this detector a few months ago. The times that I have used it I could not find a leak, even in systems that I know there were leaks, even big leaks. Especially does not work well for 410-A. But what can you expect when you pay just over $100. If you are serious, you will have to spend about $300-$400."
4,Inviting Disaster,"This is a very interisting book. It shows how allmost all disasters start as a chane of mistakes, because of greed, lack of training, companiys hideing there mistakes, ect. It also includes examples of pontial disasters that were avoided ."
3,Opportunity lost on a great piece of work...,"The story telling style is good at describing what occurred, and one has to respect the author for taking time to investigate and explain the many disasters that have occurred.There are many lessons to be learned if you run a process, design products / systems, or are responsible for maintaining equipment. Each disaster has the seeds of learning - if you want to grasp them; however not adequate effort was made to bring out these valuable nuggets.Although what could have been a great piece of work is marred by inconsistent writing and at times verbose detail, I still recommend it to many of my participants and associates.Another good book on similar topic is ""The Logic of Failure""."
4,If you don't believe in Dilbert,"Think that the managers depicted by Dilbert author Scott Adams don't exist in real life? That the mistakes attributed to the Bumbling Pharmaceutical Company in my text,""Manager's Guide to Design and Conduct of Clinical Trials,"" could never have occurred? Or that the best way to stop terrorists is with a trillion dollar anti-missile system, not a central computer for the INS? You've got to read this book; denial (just being a team player) won't help a lemming and it won't help you"
5,Love them!,"These ergonomic crochet hooks are great. Even as a relatively young crocheter without the problems of arthritis or carpal-tunnel, my hands hurt from time to time if I've been crocheting a lot. These hooks keep your fingers in a more neutral position which is healthier for your hands. After using one for a few minutes, you'll realize that you're not gripping the hook too tightly and that your hand is relaxed. I think this would be great for crocheters who tend to work too tightly.My only wish is that Clover made hooks in sizes larger than J!"
5,AMAZING,I love this hook. It work far better than the tradition hook because it is easy to grip and doesn't make your hand cramp up as soon as a tradition hook does.
1,Product never reached me....,"I ordered this for my wife as a gift and instead I was sent a single crochet needle, I wrote to the seller and they said they were looking into it and would get back. The charges got reversed on my credit card but have not got any communication from the seller about this. This was a gift and it was really embrassing. I would expect that they would atleast send me the gift set but still waiting for it."
2,Waste of money.,"This was not helpful to me at all.Information was lacking, suggestions were redundent, limited and common sense, even for young people.Waste of money. Find an old experienced nurse and ask her all you want to know. Think you'll get a better perspective."
2,"OK book, not what I was looking for","I bought this book because I am considering going to nursing school & thought this might help me see what it would be like. I read the book and also scanned through it and the topics just were not relevant to what I was looking for. I am going to purchase ""Stressed out about nursing school:an insider's guide to success by Stephanie Thibeault instead because I that will be better suited to what I am looking for."
5,Reaching Heaven opened my eyes,"I give Brenda's ""Reaching Heaven"" 5 Stars! In my 60 years of being a believer and follower of Jesus Christ, I have read and studied many articles and books on 'prayer'. None have been so impressive and eye-opening as to Jesus' 'need' for prayer and that prayer is as simple as talking to our Father in Heaven, as has 'Reaching Heaven'. As a human Jesus had to access His Father in the same way we as humans have to, through prayer. It truly enriched my prayer life and I intend to use this book at some point with my Ladies SS class. Knowing Brenda personally, helps in the authenticity of this study book."
2,Overrated,"The fact that so many people consider this Suffocation's best says a lot about the mentality of your average death metal fan. Pierced from Within is, without question, one of the most musically accomplished death metal albums ever made. Rhythmically complex, but also tonally sophisticated, with a use of dissonance and harmonic sensibility that I have never heard elsewhere in death metal. And beyond that, the songs retained a visceral power and immediacy that almost all technical death metal bands lose. You can listen to the album 30 times and still discover new things.For Suffocation to turn around and write this is a complete disgrace. It's nothing but generic death metal, with simple structures and riffs designed only to be catchy and brutal. Sure, it has a huge and intense sound, but that's all it has. Sadly, it seems that most Suffocation fans never heard more than that in Pierced from Within either."
5,Death Metal at it's brutally finest,"This is the best Suffocation release to date. Although it's only a 5 song EP, it's thier heaviest effort. And since they have recently reunited, we have all been treated to a re-release of this brutal modern classic. This EP features Dave Kulross of Malevolent Creation on drums. If you're a fan of death metal, you have to own this one."
2,Sad,"They have regressed. Pierced From within, Their third full album blows this crap away. Unless you like heavy pointless music, dont buy it. Its like listening to Symbolic by Death and then listening to Grave. Save your money!!! Buy some Athiest"
1,Terrible Keyboard Tray,"I purchased this tray at Amazon. I cannot imagine who designed this tray or why anyone tries to sell it.My first day was indicative of things to come. I pushed the tray back under the desk and the tray and the keyboard fell on the floor. A rubber bumper designed to stop the tray broke (or at least fell out). I slid the tray back in the holder. The next time, I tried to turn the tray out of the way and the same thing happened. Another rubber bumper fell to the floor.The tray is not wide enough for a standard keyboard and a mouse pad. Therefore, the makers attach a mouse pad that hangs down from the tray. Unfortunately, it has to be separately pulled out and pushed back. After a little while, it tilted so much that the mouse regularly fell to the floor. Finally, it fell to the floor.I gave up. My return for credit period had expired but I sent it back to Amazon to get it out of my house.I bought the 3M tray and have had no trouble."
3,Didn[t quite fit my workspace,"This is a well built and sturdy tray. The problem I had is that my workspace is fairly narrow so the mount for the tray didn't fit as it should. I had to mount it slanted from front to back. This will probably work for me because the platorm can be swiveled, but I didn't realize that I needed a deeper workspace. It needs to be at least 18.25 inches (about three more inches than mine). Still a good product, I think."
5,Very important,"Amid the body count of the ""worker's paradise"",Hitler's Reich,Mao's revolution and the general idealistic-nihilistic paradigm that defined the 20th century,this book is a great intro to understanding how the utopian folly rears its beastly head again and again.Stove takes on the frauds who've somehow managed to spew out their inanities and call the puke ""philosophy"".The postmodernists,the idealists and the fuzzy-brained get their proper comeuppances.The unspeakable tragedy is that the Rousseau's,Marx's,Heidegger's and their pernicious ilk were ever taken seriously and thus lent a phony air of intelligence and righteousness to the catastropic utopian movements in the 20th century.The religion of idealism has taken a sabbatical for the time being but everything comes back around again.Will the people in the future be wiser than the man of the 20th century and prevent the more gruesome episodes that defined our time in history's grinder?"
4,"""I sing of Hope. I sing of Pride.""","Heartland sings the praises of America's Middle Western farms in poetic text and full-color illustrations. Many colonial era stories, both fiction and non-fiction, focus upon the farm as a symbol of hard work and accomplishment. Thomas Jefferson, for example, was a well-known agriculturist and devoted gardener. The pioneering and self-sufficient spirit upon which this country was founded is still evident in today's farming communities. ""I am the Heartland, Great and wide. I sing of hope. I sing of pride."" This book serves as a great way to make children aware of the contemporary farming lifestyle."
5,"Moving, funny,and insightful","This album is full of heatfelt music that at times really touches me, and at other times delights me with its humor. Highly recommended!"
1,Un Film de Timbo Hines,"Call me a glutton for punishment, but after seeing Timbo Hines' no-budget ripoff of Spielberg and me's War of the Worlds in all its insane inept glory, I had to check out what else this clown had done. But the only thing out there is his no-budget 1999 ripoff of the Michelle Pfeiffer Midsummer Night's Dream (mmm, detect a pattern here?). It's out there, but only in the sense that it rushes through the play badly with just the same complete inability to understand what its actually about that his Wells' fiasco has. Add bad production values, non-existant editing and direction and all you've got is one long deceased Bard of Avon rotating in his grave.The best you can say for this sorry soggy effort is that if you hated Timbo's War of the Worlds, you'll hate this, and that if you loved Timbo's War of the Worlds - well, then you must be Timbo Hines."
1,This book sets impossible standards,"This book sets impossible standards and makes you feel guilty. I have used it very little. Unless you have a full time cook on staff, there is no way you could prepare this much food. Plus, if you are like me, and didn't have a huge appetite during pregnancy, the quantities of food are impossible. I hate this book!"
3,Good Healthy Reading for Mother's-to-be!,"I found this book extremely helpful during my first pregnancy. I admit I didn't follow the Best Odds Diet to the letter (who could possibly be THAT disciplined?), but found that even after taking my own path, using the basic guidelines of eating things that can 'remember where they came from' I was never healthier. And I firmly believe that my healthy baby boy benefited from the diet I followed. I actually lost weight during my first trimester, and within 7 weeks postpartum (post-C-section, mind you), my pre-pregnancy clothes fit loosely! How many new mothers can make that claim?!? I think it's a great guideline, but as with anything else, you'll need to adapt it to fit your lifestyle."
3,The authors don't live in the real world,"Even the most perfect, dedicated mom-to-be couldn't follow half the recommendations in this book. My doctor laughed when I asked her about some of the ""rules"". It is unrealistically strict to the point of paranoia. Still, if your goal is to be the most educated mom and then make your own choices about what to do and not do, this book IS extremely good. Ignore the unproven or the theoretical and focus on the real, proven issues. Remember women have been having babies since the beginning of time. It doesn't have to be this hard."
3,This book was so-so.,"This book has it's share of good and not-so-good recipes.The recipes are suggestions for pregnant women, and although a pregnent woman may not like everything suggested, she will find some foods to her liking."
1,Good for a laugh,"Not only does this book advocate putting raw egg whites in just about every dessert (what?), it also suggests keeping cheese in your purse for an emergency snack. I definitely feel like my afternoon queasiness will be helped by cheese that's been sitting at the bottom of my purse for seven hours :p"
3,Very strict. Not sure if up-to-date information anymore,"The diet and restrictions provided in this book are very strict, such as no ice cream, cake and other sweets. Even the fruits that you can eat are restricted."
2,Isnt't being pregnant hard enough?,"I try to to eat very healthfully and have had two kids (that I try to feed in a healthful manner). This book will just riase your blood pressure and your guilt level. Don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, and stay out of the doughnut shop except on Saturdays are easier to follow rules and will have about the same impact on your pregnancy's outcome (i.e. a healthy baby). I was glad to find out, though, that one piece of pumpkin pie provides 3 servings of orange-yellow vegetables."
5,"American Women, Expecting or Not Should Follow This Book!",I am just cracking up reading these negative reviews. Especially the ones where the women are so angry about giving up white sugar! Especially when we have a HUGE obesity crisis on our hands which is greatly affecting not only our selves but our children's obesity problems and horrendous eating habits! Specifically our obsession with white sugar!
1,No alcohol?!?!?,"I don't see how eating affects your baby. I mean the baby isn't even born yet. When I was pregnant I still wanted to have fun. I did cut back on drinking, but to try to completely eliminate drinking and smoking!?!?! Come on! What else are you supposed to due on Friday/Saturday night? What a silly book! I did not follow any of the rules. Delivery is so much easier with a low birth weight baby. I say a few drinks/smokes a week can't harm nobody. But I would never fill my baby's bottle with whiskey. You gotta draw the line somewhere."
2,very out of date,"Out-of-date information. Makes you feel guilty! There is no need to follow such strict rules. You're better off doing some research online and talking with your doctor about a diet that would suit you personally during your pregnancy. This book was a waste of money, mostly because of how out-of-date the information is. Save your self a few bucks and go get a book worth reading."
2,Too many expectations,"I bought this book for my second pregnancy because I found the original book ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" to be so valuable during my first pregnancy. After reading ""What to Eat When You're Expecting"" I felt very discouraged. This book has too many expectations for anyone let alone someone who is pregnant. Who wants to feel horrible because they ate one cookie or a bagel in a single month? I was looking for sensible not radical advice on ways to gain weight gracefully through my pregnancy while staying healthy and physically fit. Unless you thrive on strict guidelines and control, I would recommend skipping this book and instead discuss eating/weight goals with your doctor or midwife."
1,Avoid this book,"I felt like I had a good diet before getting pregnant and wanted helpful suggestions for improving my diet during pregnancy. This book did provide some good suggestions, but you really can get those ideas (without as much attitude) from ""What to Expect When You're Expecting."" This book is unnecessary and very demoralizing. I was left with the feeling that the authors had never been pregnant or maybe had a live in cook while pregnant. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
2,Don't bother.,"While the exchange guidelines are good, the whole tone of the book is unnecessarily alarmist, even punitive. I quit trying the recipes after two of them turned out to be inedible--and I didn't have morning sickness."
3,"An Alarmist Approach, Dismissed By Our OB-GYN","Herbal tea is dangerous?No white bread?By the time my wife and I had skimmed through ""What To Eat..."" we were concerned enough with what we read to ask our doctor. He dismissed it with a wave of his hand. ""Everyone is trying to sell a book,"" he said. ""The way to sell books is to say something extreme.""We found that the best way to use this book was to learn the principles (wheat germ and cottage cheese are ""efficient"" vehicles of nutrition, we found), but not become too alarmed by the extremisim.Buy the book, stock your kitchen pantry as suggested, and even try some of the recipes...but remember to take a deep breath, not panic and use your own common sense when it comes to feeding the life inside you.PS: If you haven't done so already, take a look at the excellent ""What To Expect When You're Expecting."" It has the balanced, common-sense approach to the whole ""baby thing"" that this book lacks."
1,These Women Are Crazy!,I bought this book because this is my first pregnancy and I had so many questions. BIG MISTAKE! First of all it scared the ... out of me! Was my baby was going to have a million potential problems because I don't grow my own vegtables and grains and I don't slaughter my own meat? That is how exaggerated this book is. My doctor laughed when I asked her if this book was completely off the wall. She said do not even try to go by that book. The expectations are way too high. No one can eat that way. I've always been a healthy eater and my doctor said to just keep eating the way I have been but increase the number of small meals and snacks I have. My advice is to steer clear of this book. Save your money!
2,Impossible,"Though this book does lay out some good guidelines, they are impossible to follow for anyone who doesn't just sit at home all day.My doctor also cautioned that drastically changing your diet can do more harm than good because it can mess up how your body is used to working. Cut down on bad things (salt, sugar) and add more good things (proteins, veggies)."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this book during my first pregnancy because I liked the idea of ""best odds diet"" as it was presented in ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" & was hoping for some practical tools & advice on implementing the eating plan & also some new healthy recipes. Now I have a 2 y/o & am pregnant again, so I thought I would give it another try. Still think this book is a clunker! We all know that ""junk food"" is not nourishing & that the nutritional requirements during pregnancy can be tough to keep up with, which is why some reproducable grocery lists & daily eating charts would be helpful for starters... and some recipes that actually taste good!! This stuff comes from the old-school idea that ""health food"" must be bland & boring. The overview in ""What to Expect..."" is more user-friendly, this book is didactic overkill."
1,Not worth the effort,"I bought this book after gaining 10 pounds is one month, thinking it would help me get a handle on my prengnancy weight gain. Instead, it made me feel bad, rather like I was hurting myself and my baby. I tried the diet and recipes, but after spending considerable money and time locating the necessary ingredients for the recipes, I gave up and quit wasting my time. In the end, my weight gain was fine (25 lbs), no thanks to this book! It was given away with some old maternity clothes!"
1,What planet are they on?,"The diet recommended in this book is totally unrealistic for the average American. You're under enough stress already, and probably sick enough already. Unless you already have an extraordinarily healthy diet, don't bother trying to make this big of a switch now. Example: this book forbids eating Total cereal because it has too much sugar! Puhleeze! They give you permission to ""splurge"" with a no-sugar bran muffin with fruit once a week. Whatever! Please don't encourage the alarmist authors by buying this book. Certainly try to eat healthy when pregnant, and if you have no idea what healthy eating is, read this book to get an idea of the radical end of the spectrum. Then be reasonable.Oh yeah - the fish recipe was so gross that it made me have an aversion to fish throughout my pregnancy!"
1,"I'm a granola, but this was insane!!","Wow! You can't even have regular pretzles; they must be whole wheat, salt free?! I lost six pounds in my first trimester (with nary a sign of morning sickness, mind you...) just trying to follow these crazy rules. This book is for arobicized nuts who do the stairmaster in the gym's front window in a thong. Hey, have a doughnut, will ya?"
5,For mothers looking for the very best for their babies,"This book contains all the necessary guidelines for an expectant mother to provide her baby (and herself) with the best nourishment during pregnancy. It's an excellent book. It implies work and strong will, and also sacrifice, but if you want your baby to get the best of everything, you'll have to work for it - it's not for free. To me, all efforts are worth my baby's health. I highly recommend it to expectant mothers who are unselfish and smart enough to work for the health of their babies. This book will either make you change your eating habits and have a healthy pregnancy resulting in a healthy baby, or hate the authors (or maybe yourself for not being able to meet the standards)."
4,Helpful,"I found this book helpful. I've actually ridded my house of all the ""junk"". I'm also cooking healthier. I admit that I don't follow the book to a ""T"". I use moderation and use this book. Some of the recipes are time consuming. I've enjoyed the bread and the dessert section. The main course section could use some reworking.[....]"
2,Only a saint could follow it. . .,"It was a very difficult diet to follow, and this from someone who was already seeing a nutritionist during pregnancy. If it had MORE recipies to help you eat the stuff they want you to eat, that would improve the book a great deal. But dont dismiss the herbal tea claims outright. It is very easy to cause an abortion through the right combinations of herbs. I know people who did it on purpose (a combo of certain herbs and vitamins) and have had it happen to me, once, also. Use it for a guideline to help yourself eat healthier, but I cant see anyone following it to the letter."
2,Boy this is tough to follow!,This book includes the strictest diet I have ever seen! I do not see how even the most diligent people keep from cheating. I would not reccomend this book.
1,What to eat when you are expecting,I have not received this book yet. I ordered it over a month ago!
3,Good for info,"I found that this book did give me a lot of info about what I should be eating while pregnant. I found it very helpful as a source of nutritional information. It did get a bit nazi-esque about the not so good things like sugar. While I did cut back on sugar, reading this book would make you think that eating even one candy bar would doom your child for life. I think that anyone who strictly followed the advice in the book would probably get a raised eyebrow or two from friends and family (One of the suggestions was that you should under no circumstance accept things like cake, even if it is a loved ones birthday or grandma baked it for you.) If you take the book with a grain of salt (or sugar as the case may be) it is extreamly helpful in giving you information about how to eat better."
1,Don't waste your time & money!,"I started reading this book early on in my pregnancy because a friend gave me her used copy. (I now have a healthy 2 month old son.) I was excited to start reading it, and expected some great advice. Not so! This book was a huge let down, and suggested almost impossible standards. No sugar? No white flour?! I don't think I would have made it through 4 months of morning sickness with out my Jell-o and crackers! Don't waste your money. The advice my OB gave me was to limit caffeine & sodium, and snack on fruits and veggies as much as I could. Just follow the advice of your doctor. =)"
3,"Better than the other ""What to Expect"" book","I found this book slightly more helpful than the ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" book, which I hated. It should be common sense that eating lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, and fiber (and avoiding junk food, processed food, etc.) is best for you and your baby. People who don't have good eating habits or think they can eat whatever they want during pregnancy will probably find this book helpful, although they might also find it a tad bit condescending. I mostly used this as a reference and used their recipes for inspiration."
1,As if pregnant women don't have enough to worry about.,"This is an incredibly fascist pregnancy diet book. As if one isn't already self-conscious & paranoid about every little thing that is going into her pregnant body, this book makes her think she's committing the worst of diet sins by eating like a healthy normal person. At the book's core is the ""Best Odds diet"" that is heavy on whole wheats, dairy, protein, leafy greens and NO SUGAR. It's hard to follow such a harsh line about nutrition when you are battling ""morning"" sickness, for example. Who needs this kind of pressure? Thankfully, my perinatalogist pointed out to me how excessive and unnessissary this book was, lest I freak out that I was gaining too much weight or damaging my unborn children with my ice cream cravings. While the guidelines are helpful, the hard line does more damage than good. I wouldn't even recommend this book to my biggest enemy."
1,What to eat if you want to be perfect...,"Unlike ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"", to which I gave 5 stars, I found this book ridiculous! For example, eating a bagel is considered a ""cheat"" and should only be done in extreme moderation (like once a month). I felt that if I tried to follow the eating guidelines set up in this book I would be destined to fail, because they suggest such a strict diet. I doubt that any pregnant woman with normal cravings would succeed according to the authors of this useless book. I quickly gave this one away."
1,Who wants to pay good money for 13 year old information,"I was so disappointed in this book that I have decided not to buy What to Expect when You're Expecting. It seems like people have learned a lot about nutrition in the past 13 years - but you won't find it in this book! A particularly egregious example is when they claim that you will need to combine proteins if you eat a vegetarian meal. I don't think that was believed in 1986, let alone today. I have absolutely no faith in these authors or their information."
1,don't read this book!,"this is the worst book on pregnancy and food ever written. any woman who has ever had any insecurities around body image will take one look at this book and realize it's the fault of books/ideas like ""what to eat when your expecting"" that we have issues in the first place. don't buy it, don't even borrow it, it'll just make you feel inadequate or fat!"
1,"HORRIBLE recipes, unrealistic expectations!","Yes, it is completely true what the other reviewers have pointed out - this book has RIDICULOUS standards that no human being could possibly live up to. When I first purchased this book (luckily second-hand so I didn't pay full price) I was very excited about having a wealth of knowledge and recipes at my fingertips. But as soon as I started reading it, it just made me feel so guilty and horrible about everything I ate before I knew I was pregnant, and also what I was expected to do now that I know. Talk about ruining the experience! I even tried some of the recipes in the book - the veggie soup was bogus and ""FUDGE BROWNIES""??? Give me a break, those were the most disgusting things I have ever tried to eat. They were not chocolately in the least but rather tasted like some kind of fig bars. Just listen to your body and your doctor's advice and skip this piece of trash!"
1,nothing you eat is good enough!,"that's the message of this book. the authors prohibit caffeine (from tea or coffee), herbal teas, chocolate, fat, fried foods, refined foods (by which they mean white flour or white sugar), sugar, salt, spices, pretty much anything that one might find on one's plate anywhere one goes. i eat very healthily, and found myself wracked with guilt about every bite. instead, try _the pregnancy cookbook_ (ricciotti & connelly, an OB and a chef), which has recipes for good food that you can actually enjoy."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,i didnt like the product as it had no screen to review the pictures and had problems getting it to download to the computer
4,I'm Happy!,"I recently purchased this player for my birthday as a gift to myself and I am so pleased with it that I actually just got done ordering another one as a back up, just incase I break my first one.Very Happy, I love the Auto-Reverse feature because I listen to a lot of tapes at work and it saves me from having to stop my work to flip the tape over when side one has finished.Wonderful unit, and reasonably priced, Great for the Audio Book fan."
1,radio stations overlap once I reach the city...,"Receiver is cheap, radio stations overlap once I reach the city, from my suburb. apartment. Depending on what direction I face downtown Seattle, I can get 3 or four stations playing at once. This player takes one AA battery, once the battery is low, it will eat your cassette tape. After a month and a half, the fastfoward button is now stuck and prevents the player from turning over to AM/FM/TV/WB, not to mention it drains any battery left in it, and will not play tape in this situation either. If I could find the receipt, I'd return it and seek an apology for my wasted time, money, and damaged tapes! The only good is that it is light-weight, but what else can I use it for? I think I'll take a ride to goodwill and buy three players for a $1.99 each, one of them has to work!"
2,"Great cassette player, but poor TV reception","This is a great lightweight cassette player, but if you want to listen to TV and/or radio be prepared to be disappointed. It is not as good as the older Sony model WMFX-281."
2,A fallow-up we diden't need,"""Fast Getaway"" was a light action comedy, a good mix of action and comedy. But this fallow up isen't, all that was good in the first one is gone. With better script, bigger budget and better actors it have been a good fallow up. Don't waste your time with this one, but if you like ""Double O'Kid"" maybe you will think this is a good one."
2,"""RX-7 Club.com Approved"", at least...","Not exactly the best movie of all time (or even a great one...it's actually quite cheezy... for one, there's no way Tuscon, AZ has streets that raceable...), but it has it's key points (Mainly the chases, but really.... Police keeping up with an FD? Not likely...)Anyway, if you have an unhealthy addiction to RX-7s or just wanna see a good chase scene or two, you should pick this movie up.... Otherwise it's a huge waste of timeOh.... and Cory Haim?THE RX-7 CLUB KNOWS ABOUT YOU!!!!1!"
4,Big Bulky and Beautiful,"This is one wide lens - but once I screwed it onto my F707 with one of the supplied adaptor rings and put the camera into macro mode, it was like rediscovering the camera.The quality of the glass lens makes it a great companion for the Carl Zeiss fitted to the F707 and together they make for some very good shots with minimal distortion.The gripes? Well it's huge, making the camera cumbersome and it also blocks off the built in flash. I guess you can't have everything...I do shots of hotel bedrooms/bathrooms for my clients sometimes and in small rooms, I just can't get myself far enough into the corner to get the shot to show everything I want using the normal lens. This is where this lens really shines."
2,Too clumsy,It seemed too large for the camera and made it awkward to use. It blocked the flash completely and viewfinder partially.
4,Musicians and music lovers should read this book.,"Recommended by a friend, this is a very clear, easy to follow book for anyone who likes or loves classical music and wants to get even more enjoyment out of it.As a musician myself it is very interesting to hear one of America's finest composers talk about music in a way that demystifies the listening process. To paraphrase Mr. Copland, people have no trouble going to the theater and then discussing how they felt about the performance with little or no background in the dramatic arts, yet people who go to classical music concerts are not sure they are qualified or educated enough about music to ""understand"" or form and opinion about it.This book teaches the reader that ""I don't know anything about music"" doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. By applying the information in this book one can potentially learn to hear more by becoming an active listener, which in turn increases understanding and enjoyment."
2,Beginners Only,"If you know the first thing about music, this is not the book you need. If you know what melody, harmony and rhythm is, have seen a cello before, if you don't need pages of text and printed music examples to explain to you what ABA form is - there's gotta be other books out there. I came to this book from a somewhat musical background, thinking it might be a good introduction to classical music. Don't. It'll only make you think ""is that all there is to it?"", that the emperor is very thinly dressed."
2,Too chit chatty,Sorry I don't like to have to read 40 pages to get one point. Just too much wording without giving me any progress in understanding. I'm just too impatient. I need at least every 5 sentences to add something. I'm sure it's a nice book if I had the time and could stay awake long enough to wait for a point to be made.
2,Why we listen to music?,"Most people listen to music simply because we enjoy it. It's ridiculous to divide the whole listening process into several planes. Aaron has made listening to music too complicated. This book may help if somebody wants to pose as an expert in music while actually he doesn't know much about music. If your purpose is to enjoy music, forget this book¡"
2,For beginners,"If you've sung in a chorus or played in a band or orchestra, you'll know most of what's in the book. There are some insights however. It helps if you can read music."
4,"Enlightening, but should come with a CD.","The idea: achieve a deeper understanding of all kinds of music by listening intelligently.Although I play piano, whatever deep understanding I have of music is limited to just a few aspects of it. This book has indeed broadened my appreciation a bit.Since Copland frequently demonstrates his points by referring to particular segments of particular pieces, I think the concept might be better served by a radio documentary. Or at least it should come packaged with a CD, like computer books do!"
3,Elementary Conscepts,"This book is a very easy book to read, however there are a few problems. As another review mentions, this book is clearly not for any one who has knowledge of music prior to reading this book. It spends much time explaining very elementary conscepts. For those who don't know what a violin looks like this is a very good book. For the beginner musician I highly recommend Aaron Copland's book, since it is very easy to read and understand. However for someone with a little more experience in music, this book is clearly not a good choice."
5,"three giants in folk music, blues, etc","woody, pete, and leadbelly says it all. a nice selection of each of their music. a must buyr"
2,missing parts,"The hose adapter was missing and so was an owners manual. opened the box and only the pump was there. unfortunately, my husband opened the box and didn't tell me it was missing parts until after the return time had expired. Lesson learned. Check your boxes when you get them."
3,Do not use in chlorine,"I have a small decorative pond and in 4 seasons have gone through 4 Little Giants. It is my belief that these pumps failed prematurely due to using them in a Chlorinated environment. I finally was able to speak to the manufacturer about this issue and they advised that these pumps are not designed to withstand chlorine. They suggested I purchase a Cal Pump C1200, which I did. Hopefully it will tolerate my chlorinated pond."
2,NOT the item advertised,"This pump, which is a later version of the previous pump I owned, was advertised as being ""UL and CSA listed"". However while it does have the CSA listing and sticker, it is NOT UL listed nor does it bear the UL sticker. My previous pump clearly has the UL sticker on it and was UL listed, and I bought this pump thinking it was the same, yet it obviously is not. I called the Little Giant pump manufacturer, Franklin Electric, and they confirmed this model of pump is not now UL listed. So I feel I got ""sandbagged"" by Amazon."
5,L.G. Review,"Hi, I had one of these pumps for years before it failed, was glad to find another just like it. So far this one is doing Great!! I bought it on Amazon.comThanks"
3,maybe not what they used to be,"I bought one in September 2010, and it failed in June 2011. I've had a number of these running the fountain and filter in my 1000 gallon pond. The pump runs a few hours per day and sometimes the water level is a bit low but I hoped that the thermal protection would take care of things. At any rate, this one will now run for only a few seconds with no load. Looking back it seems that the lifetime of this model of pump is decreasing.Otherwise, they are compact and not too hard to keep cleaned up.As others have noted, they do leak oil."
1,Very disappointed .,"I bought 2 of these pumps as my backups. I had them for a little over a year before I needed one for my Koi pond and after 3 months it leaked oil , What a mess. And since the guarantee is only a year I'm out of luck. I always used the black pumps for the last 15 years and had no idea these blue ones weren't as good. My opinion. I wouldn't buy another one, will pay more and get the black one."
3,what I needed,"This is my third one, I wear one out ot every 3-4 years, but it beats paying three times more for one I would replace as often as I do not maintain or respect my equipment"
1,5.5 ASP is a poor pump for fountain,"Little Giant 5.5-ASP Submersible Sump PumpI have used the Little Giant 5.5 ASP submersible pump only one time and just recently noticed oil in my fountain, thinking my pool man was not cleaning well. Pump was still working until still leaked oil and then pump just died. what a waste of money since just recently replaced the pump and had to pay lots of money for install. And now to think that i have to buy another and have it installed. No way.. i am changing pumps. You are a Little Pea not a Giant."
3,Little Giant 5-MSP,"This pump is used in a water fountain that I purchased which runs 24/7 circulating the fountain water. Under these running conditions the pump last anywhere from 1 to 1.5 years then needs replacement due to failure. Failure usually is from internal oil leaking from the pump into the fountain water. My last pump purchased lasted less than 6 months, but was completely replaced by the manufacturer under the 1 yr warranty.Wouldn't suggest this pump be used in a fountain or pond that contains fish due to possible oil leaking into the water.As a utility pump or sump pump that gets occasional use, it's a work horse."
3,Leaks oil at top seal and paint mostly gone (5 years),"The pump works very well, except that after about 5 years, the paint is mostly gone, and there is a little bit of oil which comes out of the pump everytime it is used (forms an oil sheen on the top of the water)."
1,This product sucks,"This product sucks. I have purchased 4 of the littlegiant pumps over the last 5 years, to get the rainwater off my pool cover. At first I thought that is was theway it was used. The last 3 I would take off the cover afterit cleared the water. They always burn out before a full year.Find another pump. This product sucks."
4,Water pump,"This pump works surprisingly well. It pumps a lot of water quickly providing it is in deep enough water. When the water level gets low, it continues to pump but goes very slowly and will shut off if the water gets to low. If it does shut off, do not think that it burned out, simply unplug it let it cool put it in deeper water and it should start up again."
1,Little Giant pump junk!,Had a Little Giant 5 MSP pump for my back yard 4 foot high waterfall with pond water feature for over 6 years and it eventually failed (froze up). Replaced it(bought from Amazon) with identical unit and it failed (froze up) after about 7 months (Nov 2012). Find another manufacturer. The new Little Giants are garbage. Don't buy Little Giant!
4,Little Giant Pump Replacement,"My old Little Giant Submersible pump gave up after more than 20 years of service removing excess water from my pool while closed for the winter. With a record like that, I opted to replace my old Little Giant with a new Little Giant. No reason to change brands!"
1,Cheap apparently for a reason,I bought two at one time since they have previously only lasted less than a year on my fountain. The last one I bought has lasted less than two months.
5,It's the best book i've read recent;y!!,"I'm a fifteen year old and I thought the book was very interesting. It was quite humerous, yet it made me cry at times also. I reccommend Wm. Lee Carter's books to anyone."
2,Does *not* work on the Xbox 360!,"Warning, this is does *NOT* work on the Xbox 360!I saw a recent nostalgia article on several of the games, and picked up this collection expecting to play it in emulation mode on my 360, and it does work. Now to drag the xbox out of the closet..."
5,Good compilation of games.,The collection of games that are including are a good variety. The Xbox 360 does not support the disc but it still is a good compilation of games.
5,Like tech thrash ?,"then you need this album now .......... the guitar work is an amazing balance of thrash fury and amazing technicality. the vocals are amazing and are sung amazingly well. i cant recommed this band enough ........ def. a hidden jewel. long broken up , but at least they just re-released this and the other toxik album THINK THIS to have. sure beats some of the boring c**p out thee today, just get it."
3,Just listen to the guitarist,"This is easy. Screaming vocals, speeeeeeed metal, and a guitarist that won't quit. Nothing subtle. Over the top. If you don't like the guitar on World Circus, then you don't play (I have for over 40 years). This guy was (is) extremely fast and accurate. The songs? Not bad, but the technical part of this is what impresses."
1,garbage,i live for classic thrash. i never really heard these guys back in the day. now i wish i never did. this is the lamest thrash metal album ever. these dweebs are total puzzies and the music is really bad and phony. the lead singer should have hanged himself(preferably after he shot the band). dont waste yer cash on this junk. should be negative 5 stars.
2,George is King but he is not on the Throne on this one.,Too many voice changes. George is king when he sings/hums/and talks his way when he stopped loving her today. There will never be another.
3,Nice ethereal music,"The music is nice , though not what I expected. Perhaps it's because not all my favorite recordings were represented. On the whole a label worth having for the first time listener"
3,The Original Killer in the Woods Slasher?,"The Burning came out before Friday the 13th or did it? Its always going to be a debate about that. The film is a by the books, maniac in the woods story. I found the movie to be very boring in the middle but there was awesome killing scenes that made up for it, even though there wasnt alot. The pervert actully lives in this film! I recommend this to horror fans but dont expect nothing speical."
3,Classic 80s Horror Movie,"This is classic 80s horror. 5 teen boys accidently set fire to a camp host, he escapes with his life. 5 years later he comes back for revenge. Now at camp, a secondary story starts about teens hooking up. You have the classic jock, the joker, the nerd and the weird kid that everyone picks on. The music is set just right for on the edge of your seat experiences. The quick stops and flashes of images literally make you scream outloud. The suspense will drive you mad, as you have to imagine what the killer looks like, as you can only see through his eyes. Simple cat and mouse techniques throughout as you wait for a glimse of the monster. You do get to see him in the end. Effects pretty good for this movie. Lots of blood in the end. Grab your friends and a bucket of popcorn, see this one in the dark.

5,The Burning,"I'm writing from Sweden and i must have yhis movie on DVD , because we have another system than you so i can not buy a VHS movie either , please hurry to sell as DVD"
4,Better than Friday the 13th...,"The Burning, although a carbon clone of F13th, is still an exceptional film. The character of Cropsy is a dark, and frankly gruesome persona. His burns are more realistic than Freddy Krueger's, which makes the look more unsettling. Unfortunately you do not see much of Cropsy until the final 10 mins of the film. (And he meets an unpleasent end.) What also makes this film better than F13th is the characters. Although they can't really act, they are more funny and often more likeable than those in other slasher films. Also, The Burning does not have a string of dullard sequels, which makes this stand out as a cult classic. The Burning, though often dull, is a worthy horror and one that shouldn't be overlooked. Watch out for the notorious raft scene massacre."
1,SOOOOOOOOOO SORRY I BOUGHT THIS ONE!!!!!!,"This was such a lousy movie! Being the HUGE horror fan that I am - I had never heard of this one - (that SHOULD have been a clue) But, after reading the reviews, I was encouraged . . . Compared to the old greats like the original Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street this had such promise, but there were so many characters to keep track of - (NOT that I CARED about any of them) and the end was soooo lame (with that stupid looking gigantic pink head) in the mind shaft or where he was - Who cares!!! Oh well, Live and Learn. . . don't waste you time and especially NOT your money on this one!!"
5,Top 3: 80's slasher of all time.,This film has it all and even beats some of the best classic Friday The 13th films. If you love 80's slasher summer camp film this is the cream of the crop. To bad we don't have a sequel or a remake.
3,Gore: Yes. Originality: No.,"Tom Savini's gore effects are the highlight of ""The Burning."" The film is Mirimax President Harvey Weinstein's first mainstream production. The character of Cropsy is a poor man's Jason Voorhees. His backstory is revealed in a quick and crude fashion. Also of interest are the film debuts of Holly Hunter, Jason Alexander and Fisher Stevens. They all turn in forgettable performances. The ""uncut"" version of the film is where you will witness early Tom Savini at his finest, especially in the raft sequence!"
4,A surprise uncut re-release of a slasher classic,"Originally released to theatres in 1981 and later on video in a heavilly cut version, The Burning is now available in America uncut for the first time via Amazon.com. Thrill to the infamous raft massacre in all it' s finger-snippin' glory! Grove on the splattery gore in the throat slash- ing and scissor-stabbing scenes. And don't forget the screen debuts of Holly Hunter ("" Tod!!!"")and a surprisingly svelte and hairy Jason Alexander. A must-see for Tom Savini and slasher completists."
2,CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE (done over again ... and again ... and),"Typical 80s rehashing of the Camp(fill in the blank) mass murderer. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. If you like those movies, you'll enjoy this one. Not terrible, but just the same ol thing."
3,Not what i expected..but not bad,"When I heard that this was hitting DVD it was like Christmas in September. I had never seen it and couldnt wait to have my own opinion about...Well here goes: The effects were great (kinda wish we could go back to the ""old days"" of special f/x). The acting....hmmm okay. Love the story line! better than the ""Friday"" plot. Nothing is perfect it has its down moments but you gotta love the guy from seinfield."
4,Another good slasher from the 80's,"If you love films like Friday the 13th/which is still on the top/,Sleepaway camp or others good slashers from the golden 80's,you will love this film.The story is simple,but it doesnt matter.There is wonderfull nature,camping teenies,and bloody murders/from maestro Tom Savini/."
4,80s fun,"This movie is in the mold of friday the 13th but I think was actually written before friday the 13th part 2 or 3 or something like that.Years ago Cropsy who the kids hated at camp is burned terribly in a prank gone wrong.He somewhow survives though.From there its the same formula as many slashers,killer on the loose at camp.Is it real or just a legend?What makes this one work I can't describe but its pure fun to watch and throws a few scares at you(specially the raft scene..that scene alone is worth owning the movie).Also the majority of the death scenes occur in the daytime which is kind of cool.The characters are somewhat likeable and its really funny to see Jason Alexander(George from Seinfeld)young,in shape and with a full head of hair.The dvd cover is kinda of cool(not that it means much)and the dvd transfer looks great.If your a fan of 80s type slashers definitely check this gem out before its remade."
4,A horror fans dream,"This movie captures all aspects of a true horror fans dream. It resembles Friday the 13th in many ways, yet still manages to have its own magic. The movie centers around a widely disliked caretaker named Cropsey, who is burned severely in a horribly gone wrong teenage prank. The caretaker, after being released from the hospital, decides to take his vengeance out on the teens that are staying at the camp. The film is from then on non-stop trills and chills. Make up artist Tom Savini out does himself, with his gory, throat slitting talent. This movie is a must see for all of you who love horror movies. And the best part is its a true story!"
4,"Better , smarter , scarier","Many ""slasher"" films of the 1980's and beyond have stuck to a simple and oft stupid and insulting formula . That being , give the audience the least respect and regard you can . Churn them out (slasher films) and keep them simple and dumb . Whatever you do (as a filmmaker or franchise) don't tax the film goer or develop ANY character (if humanly possible) . This VERY GOOD departure sticks to the blueprint to a certain degree . On the other hand , much consideration is given to both story and character development here . Honestly , one seldom gets their money's worth in this sub-genre . I'm delighted to report that is not the case here . Others will write in greater detail why . They are , by and large , right on the money . Worth owning to be sure . Scary and exciting . And smart ."
5,Tom Savini is the best!!!,"Excellent film d'horreur que j'ai eu plaisir à revoir,hélas encore introuvable en France.Tom Savini y excelle dans son domaine et nous offre là des effets gore incroyables."
3,Great horror camp movie,"If you like Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp, you'll enjoy this one. It's one of the most scary slasher movies I've seen this far.The killing scenes were all pretty creepy, especially on the raft."
1,The Burning,"Just another Slasher Movie with Full Frontal Female Nudity Riding the Coattails of Friday The 13th, There is a young Haired ""George Costanza""(Jason Alexander),I don't understand why the killer can't kill the original pranksters that led to what Happen?"
1,Doesn't deserve any accolades,"I do not understand why this movie is lauded.During the 80's slasher wave, this fit in pretty well with the usual ""Friday the 13"" stuff, but, today, this film looks so cheap and poorly produced. The acting is terrible, the potential victims are simply meat (no character development whatsoever), the villain is hardly menacing and the kill scenes are so fake. The canoe scene is sooooooo ridiculous!If you view this movie as a training ground for up and coming movie makers than I can understand some form of appreciation. However, as a ""horror"" movie this is cheeeeeeeese!"
5,Great album highly under-rated band,"Check out my comments on Glitz Blitz and Hits DVD review.This band were and still are, great. Desolation Boulevard is one of my favourite albums and its one that still sounds as good today as over 30 years ago when it was recorded. Technology wasn't available then either so they had to be able to produce the goods for real not rely on sound effects and drum machines and they did so with devastating effect. There is not one single track on here that isn't great. Both Def Leppard and Queen were clearly very strongly musically influenced by them, listen to this and you'll find out why."
2,Much different tracks then my original American album!,Still a good CD but I thought I was getting the original American release which apparently was different then the original European release. Completely different track list. Make sure you review before purchasing!
4,DESOLATION BOULEVARD (IMPORT),"FOX ON THE RUN- NOT ORIGINAL USA VERSION. ALTERNATE VERSION FOR U.K. TURN IT DOWN HAD A FLAW IN RECORDING. WAS HIGH VOLUME WHEN STARTED OUT. THEN GOT WEAK IN SOUND. BUT STILL STOOD OUT AFTER IT GOT GOING. MY GENERATION-THE WHO'S RECORDING DONE BY THEM DONE WELL. MAN WITH A GOLDEN ARM (DRUM SOLO) TOO LONG. LADY STARLIGHT, I WANNA BE COMMITTED,SOLID GOLD BRASS AND TEENAGE RAMPAGE AWESOME SONGS. 6-TEENS AND MADUSSA ALRIGHT. I HAVE A LOUD BUTTON ON MY RECIEVER. IF TURNED OFF. IT SOUNDS BETTER AND CLEAR. USUALLY IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND FOR A DIGITALLY REMASTER. THE ANALOG REMASTERS WAS USED MAKING THIS CD."
1,Looking for Lady Starlight,I have the orig LP record GIVE US A WINK which has a better version of Lady Starlight on it. This song is not on the CD. So I found this import version of Desolate Blvd which has Lady Starlight on it - only it's a more primitive version of the song. I can't find the version of LADY STARLIGHT that I have on the LP record. I am still looking for Lady Starlight.The rest of this CD is crappy. Not very good songs at all. BOO HOO HOO
4,Americanization of an album,"This album is great! I bought a copy back in 1975 and wish I still had the vinyl. It was way ahead of its time, due to some risquee vocals. There are songs about gang violence, S&M, and being generally insane. It was the Americanized version of their Desolation Boulevard British CD. That one contained none of the questionable material. However, if you buy the import now, it contains a song about oral sex called Someone Else Will! Oh, the British! Both titles are well worth the purchase. A band ahead of it's time, and two of the originals have sadly passed away. Get both if you can!"
3,All you need to start a club,I use this to start a girl's club with my home school group. It turned out to be a success.
4,I LOVE this book!,"This book has so many good tips and ideas and I went and used some of them a couple days after I bought the book! First, you take a quiz that says whether you're a Sparkly Girl, Nature Girl, Sunny Girl, or Bold Girl. I was a Bold Girl, but I ended up doing ideas in all off the categories. Some of their ideas were a little more realistic than others, but overall I think this book is great!"
1,"Amerixan Girl ""Girls Club Kit""","I bought a used copy of this kit and was only sent the book. The kit should have also contained stcikers, cards etc. i was misled and had to wait 3 weeks for the book to arrive"
4,A Collector's Guide,"A helpful guide for collectors of treen (utilitarian wooden objects) and monastery-era earthenware. Has brief histories of the crafts, along with black and while illustrations of dozens of examples of collectible objects. Also a glossary of terms, a listing of manufacturers (both old and new) and information about the often very difficult task of dating of treen objects. This book is certainly helpful and informative, but may not be as in-depth as some would prefer, but to suit those readers, the author has graciously provided a bibliography for more in-depth study. Some may also wish that there were photographed examples of objects instead of just drawings, although the drawings are good, detailed ones and may actually be of greater clarity and detail than simple photographs. This book is certainly a good starting place for collectors."
4,Good book,I grew up on Jim Kjelgaard but i had never read this particular book. While it is for younger readers i greatly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of this author.
4,Good read about a dog and his companion,"Never heard of this author until I found out that my husband is a fanatic about his books. Downloaded to my kindle to try one of his books and thought it was an awesome read. Gave it only 4 stars due to the fact that the book is a little slow to begin and I had to force myself to sit and read it, but once it got started it turned out to be well worth the read if you enjoy adventures with dogs in them."
5,Nice Leak Detector,"This leak detector works great!I bought it for work. It is very sensitive, it can sense a decent size leak from outside a condenser. So far I am 5/5 with finding leaks. My company's leak detector (a D-Tek) is no where near as sensitive, even on high.It does come with a nice nilon case, and a wall charger.**NOTE: Keep in mind that this DOES NOT come with a vehicle charger. You must buy that seperate."
1,Burned out after one month...,"This leak detector worked fine for the first month, then for no apparent reason it just stopped. Would not recharge battery, would not run. TIF (now owned by SPX distress business management...) would not honor the 25 year warranty without the original sales receipt. I bought this unit online several years ago and due to computer replacement no longer had the original invoice. I guess that's their way of avoiding repairs. Nothing to lose so I pulled it apart and found a couple of transistors fried. Oh well, so much for the TIF brand. I purchased a replacement CPS detector instead of messing with the TIF anymore. They have since discontinued this model leak detector and replaced it with a refaced unit. Use extreme caution when purchasing anything with the SPX brand logo on it. They take over distressed companies and seldom honor any warranty claims. Buyer beware."
5,"Interesting Time, Interesting Person","In March of 1941, Butch Voris joined the Navy as a pilot trainee. This was a time of peace. But before his training ended, it was no longer peace time. The country and soon Butch Voris was at war. The planes they flew were Wildcats, not exactly the best machines to use up against Zeros. Not to many of the early fliers survived the war, but in spite of a number of close calls Butch did.After the war Butch was personally selected by Admiral Nimitz to set up a demonstration team to attract people to join the Navy. He did, it was called the Blue Angels. Before too long, another little situation came up called Korea. After that Butch went back to the Blue Angels, the only person ever to command it twice. Butch Voris eventually left the navy and went ot work for Grumman, being involved in the development of the F-14.The book is well written, and covers an interesting period of an interesting person's life."
3,"Great film, poor DVD.","Like all of the Fox/Lorber releases of Eric Rohmer's ""Six Moral Tales"" film series, I'd give this film 5 stars for content, especially if you enjoy writer/director Eric Rohmer's subtle, deliberatly paced, conversational style. His films crawl into your consciousness slowly and before you know it you're hooked. Unfortunatly I'd give the DVD transfer 1 star as it looks and sounds no better than Fox/Lorber's currently available VHS version and there are no extras to speak of except for incomplete director and star filmography listings. The film is not presented in its original aspect ratio and the French subtitles are burned into the print and so are not removable from the screen. Thus average rating: 3 stars. END"
2,Avoid this DVD,"Great film, but terrible transfer. If you watch this film for the first time on this DVD, you will get a very bad impression of this great film. So avoid it. But anyway there is never to expect much quality from FLA."
1,Too flimsy,I have the Belkin but ordered this for my son's fiancee. It's too flimsy and I'm embarrassed I purchased it for her. Would not recommend.
5,Exellent Book! A Must Reader,"This is a great book, i have read all the mancer books and they are fantasticly great. If you love fantasy you will love all of Don Callander's books. This one is by far the best mancer book i have read(except geomancer, because i have not read it yet. It is out of print). I hope you enjoy this book and all the others by Don Callander."
2,Error-ridden and buggy,"My husband has been out of school for over 25 years, when he decided he wanted to take a Masters degree, so we needed a really good test prep product. The book is just fine at explaining concepts and ideas, and providing test strategies. But the CD is deeply disappointing. The questions are full of errors, many of them simply a matter of poor proofreading (in one, the greater-than sign is reversed into a less-than sign, making the entire question unsolvable). My husband was two questions away from the end of one of the practice tests on the CD when it froze up. Am I too picky in thinking a test-prep product should have ZERO errors, and software that works consistently? I don't think so!"
1,Poorly Written and Edited,"After using numerous other GMAT preparation tools from Kaplan, GMAC, and elsewhere, the quality of this product is below subpar. Numerous typographical and logical errors are present in the text, including:-Questions on reading comprehension sections that were not printed (page 18)-Duplicate answer choices for a question (page 71)-An apparenty inability to number questions from 1 to 41 (page 45)Given the lack of attention to detail along with a number of questionable justifications for answers, I would not recommend this book to anybody. Go with Kaplan, Kaplan800, or Princeton Review instead."
2,"OK for the basics, but doesn't cut it","This book has a good basic review of math, but it doesn't cover NEARLY all the things you need to know to take the GMAT. There are many questions in the book which are not addressed in the review section. The Verbal review is TERRIBLE. If you aren't an english major, I guarantee you will not understand what they're talking about. The best part of the book is the review questions, which any other book should be able to provide. The CD-ROM was VERY disappointing. If you're taking the test and want to stop, you can't save and come back to it, you have to take each test all the way through before you can see the answers. Long story short, pick another book.. you probably couldn't do much worse."
1,Incorrect Answers - A complete waste.,"I found a couple errors in the questions.One data sufficiency question asked about congruent triangles, giving you the area of the large triangle. Both the stems were each of the lengths of the same side of the triangle, one being larger than the other.Oddly enough, you cannot find another side to the smaller triangle (or the large one, for that matter) because they did not state that it was a right triangle. Had they stated that, the question would have been right. Instead, it was wrong.There were several questions like this. Sometimes a question would pop up more than once depending on how the software felt. I don't even trust it to tell me the right answer to the rest of the test I took.What a waste."
1,very disappointing,"the software on the CD did not work as it should1) It did not give me a score on an 800 scale at the end of the test2) On some questions it did not allow me to change my answer even though I hadn't yet confirmed my response (i.e I hadn't yet moved on to the next question, I had merely clicked on a response)3) Worst of all were the reading comprehension questions. In the actual GMAT the tester is presented in with a passage and all questions related to the passage are listed together. Not so on the Barron's CD - the software presents questions related to reading comprehension in random order across the test. So you could get reading comprehension passage # 1, followed by one question related to passage #1; then some sentence correction questions then a reading comprehension passage #2, followed by 1 question related to passage #2; then another question related to passage # 1.4) there were numerous typos"
2,Not great.,"As a review guide, this book is fairly decent. Unfortunately, that's about where it ends. There are very few practice questions, and several of them are incorrect. Additionally, the CD that comes with this version - which nearly doubles the price - is almost completely worthless. The first question of one of the CAT tests had an error which made it unsolvable. On top of that, you can't save your progress if you don't want to do the entire exam.If you see this at a garage sale, by all means, pick it up. But the ""Pass Key"" version of this book (which retains most of the review material and omits most examples) is a better buy, supplemented with the GMAC books or Kaplan. But if you're looking for a top-to-bottom study guide, I'd skip this."
5,Great Product,I scored exactly the same on the GMAT as I did on the last practice test. Nearly 40 points higher than the first practice test. The strategies helped the most. A must have!
3,Hit-and-miss analysis,"Caputi does a fine job of making the (arguably obvious) connection between socially accepted elements of masculinity, modernity, and sexual killing. However, her research is selective and sometimes inaccurate, and one can't help but feel that she must, on occasion, simply have gotten things wrong because she has been trying too doggedly to make her point.Her radical feminist position (and the language used in support of it, i.e. terms such as 'gynocide') will put some readers off. However, I recommend checking this book out if you have any interest whatsoever in the cultural context of sexual murder and its roots in masculintiy.For better researched and better written analysis of this subject, I would suggest ""The Lust to Kill"" by Deborah Cameron and Elizabeth Frazer (unfortunately it's out of print, but as I type this, a couple of copies are available secondhand through Amazon)."
1,Not my kind of book,"First Sentence: The looked over the dash of the new Ford Taurus, already littered with PowerBar wrappers, thanks to his partner.Recently returned from Bosnia, Alex Duarte is an ATF agent in South Florida. Partnered with attorney Caren Larson, they are on the trail of a serial bomber. But they are not the only ones on the hunt.It's not fair to say I hated this book (according to 1 star)because I just couldn't finish it. If you like noir, this may be for you but it was just not the book for me. I didn't care about the characters, which is always the kiss of death. The violence against innocent people was the clincher. After 79 pages, I decided it was time to move on to another book."
3,Ken (Killer) McCoy is back!,"As other have observed, Griffin has chosen to leave out about six years of history for the series. However, providing he lives long enough, and based on his previous record, I'm sure he'll get back to them and fill us in on what happen between 1944 and 1950.I am also concerned about the accuracy of the proof readers. Surely the proofing of the galleys could be done by someone familiar with the series?I enjoyed the book, and would still recommend it for Griffin enthusiasts. At this writing I noted today that Griffin's next novel is due in bookstores in January 2003 - part of the Badge of Honor series."
3,An okay story by a super writer.,"I thought Under Fire was just an okay story by this really super writer. I was expecting a much better story. I don't know what was missing in the story exactly, can't pin point it but there was something a miss. Hopefully his next book will be better!"
3,Not up to standard,I am a huge fan of W.E.B. Griffin and read everything he writes. I enjoyed Under Fire simply because I love all its characters and also enjoy military type literature. BUT; this book falls far short of the standards of excellence readers have come to expect from Griffin. The editing errors are many and monumental. They have been pain-stakingly cataloged by other reviewers so I won't repeat them again; but Gee Whiz guys didn't anybody proofread this book before it was published? Obviously not. Secondly; there is way too much mundane nonsense and page filler; much of which could have been edited and not affected the story a whit. I hope very much that we get a new volume soon which will tie this rambling story together; but please take whatever time you need to do a better job of writing and proof reading BEFORE you publish.Thanks.
3,Good Book,"I put this up with all due respect to Mr. GriffinWhile I enjoyed the book, I am afraid I have to say that this particular title was not up to Mr. Griffin's usual level. I have followed the series since his first Book with Malcolm S. Pickering and always enjoyed the adventure.While this book had some of that adventure, I found myself reading lines from his previous book(s) and because of this and the in depth detail that I found unnecessary, I quite honestly wanted to bypass a number of pages Something that I have never done on any of his previous books.Would I buy it, would I purchase or give the book to a friend or family member to read? - Yes, but I still think that Mr. Griffin could have done better, it's just expected."
5,Under Fire,The book was very easy to read almost impossible to put down. I have read other books by this author and never been disappointed.
4,Under Fire,A very good read. Guess there wasn't much for Major McCoy to do after the Gobi Desert. Would have liked to have seen the victors come home from WW2 before taken on the North Koreans and Chinese.like the way the characters were introduced and brought up to date. Definitely recommend this book.
3,Sad,"As others have said, where is 1944 to 1950? Last I knew Killer was in China with the weather channel, Donovan was running the OSS, and FDR was running the country. Emeral says BAM 1950. A lot was lost and unfinished. Do not read this book if you haven't read the others but a must if you are going to read more of WEB's books. Mr. Butterworth you need a new proof reader, the last one passed up a lot of mistakes in the writting. i.e. you can't leave Puson and travel to Puson. Good luck on the next book I am a hooked reader but, a little disappointed with this one."
1,rip off,Have read Griffin before and been waiting for kindle versions to come down in price. But won't order this one - what the heck? A dollar more than every other one in the series? When are these folks going to realize we won't pay premium prices for an electronic file? Wake up publishing industry - you are signing your own death warrant...
4,"A very good read but, not up to Griffins usual.","I have read everynone of Griffin's books in his several series(The Corp., Badge of Honor,ect.). The plot dreagged twoard the end which was not typical of his other books. I was glad to see Ken and Earnie finally get together. This book left unanswered many questions from his previous book but hopefully they will be answerd in his next. What about Martha? What about the Captian and the navy nurse? All were left hanging in the last book. Being a tru Griffin fan I will anxiously await the next. Tell me Mr. Griffin is this a ploy to get us true fans of yours to anxiously await the next?"
2,Borrow this book from a friend and save your $,"As a female civilian I am obviously not qualified to comment on the combat ""action"" or military names, dates, ranks etc. I have just ""enjoyed"" Mr. Griffin's stories, until now. Not only were the number of typos OUTRAGEOUS and actually an interferrence, even simple gramatical structure was MISSING!I'm sorry but the background stories of Ernie and Ken and Pick being MIA seemed forced somehow. While I did finish the book, it was a struggle.I think it will be a long while before I trust my spare time and hard earned $'s to Mr. Griffin's future sagas."
2,not the best w.e.b.griffin,"""Under Fire"" is an uneven and a poor attempt at reviving an old and favorite group of characters from the excellent Marine series. Griffin has this time failed to capture the spirit and flavor of what has made him so very good. In this book he wastes our time with characters we both loved and loathed. He brings in the detestable Macklin in a complete waste of time for a few heart beats. Griffin leaves as usual the ending open for his sequel. It is a poor unanswered ending to a question that he has failed to convince us is important and has impact! There are no real hero's in the magnitude of his past editions. We are instead thrown a few bones and given a taste of what once was from this great author. I am sorry to say that this is a weak (and probably his weakest) attempt ever. I missed the flavor and intensity that made me wait in lines for his latest book. I hope he can get back on track!"
2,The Corps is going downhill in a hurry,"The Griffin autopilot is fully engaged in this edition of The Corps series. While there needs to be some repetition so that each novel can stand alone, there was so much review that Under Fire Should start it's own sequence of books ""The Spies"". Plot errors and edit mistakes abound. For those who have followed this series, the question (at least mine) is ""did I miss a book""? There is a huge gap between In Dangers Path and Under Fire.Not to be overly critical, it's still a decent beach or airplane read."
4,tired characters - good stories,"Basically I want to reiterate what most everyone has said. It does get tiring that all the good main characters are rich and/or have rich lovers and that the only way to get stuff done in the military is to act outside the lines of command and not only bend the rules, but throw them away.And I do wonder what happened between the Gobie Desert and Seoul. However having repeated all that, I really enjoy this series. It's given me an interest to find out more about what was going on in WW2. I'm constantly surprised when I search out some interesting fact in Griffin's books and find out it's really true. That is the real value in these books of fiction - that the facts there pull you into wanting to learn more."
2,Under Edited,"Totally disappointed with this one. Of course the publisher of this book knows loyal Griffin readers will buy it upon or after it's release. How can any book editor allow a book to contain the enormity of unedited typo's and lack of continuity this book contains is beyond me? Because of the poor editing and lack of continuity many of the pages had to be re-read. Of course I will be one the first in line to buy his next release, hopefully the editor of the next book will not be asleep at the switch. ..."
3,Just bought it [....],"Just arived about 100 pages in I am hooked. Read the other Corp novels this year. A little sad that WWII ended in 1943 in those, but hey this is great. Read the Brotherhood of War series and hated the Generals 1st ending. I Hope we follow Pick to the Gulf War. Please WEB don't end it in Pusan. I wonder if Task Force Lowell will be mentioned? It's in the text book you know."

1,No light whatsoever,"I should have read the previous review before ordering, because this product did not work at all. The on/off button did not work/click. The light produced a very faint light, less than a cell phone emits. Don't buy this product; there are better flashlights out there."
3,A Sangre Fria (In Cold Blood),Might be a good movie but it's in Spanish with no subtitles so I only watched the start and skimmed additional areas to confirm but never found any subtitles. Gave three stars so as not to unfairly influence other viewers that may be Spanish speaking if they only checked the star rating.
3,Average,"Another very average movie given the superb No Shame treatment. Why can't Noi Shame put out some better quality films from this genre / era, instead of the very averge stuff they choose to release. Not worth the time of any Italian movie buff."
3,"great looking, needs more features","I bought this backpack for my 8 year old son who loves LSU. It is great looking, but is rather large. It is meant for a college student. I pulled the straps all the way in and he is able to use it.A big downside is there is only one large section (except for a small interior pocket) There is usually a pocket for small items like pencils/pens etc. and side pockets."
5,Incredible new game!,"Just finished playing Project Snowblind and I have to say it was incredibly intense from the moment I picked it up, all the way through to the dramatic conclusion.I've played Halo2, and i really think this one stacks up well against that, and really kills any of the other FPS games on the Playstation. The single player game is very solid and the multiplayer can't be put down.Love it!"
3,Fun Game,After playing all the Socom and MOH games it was nice to have a different format. Snowblind is a futuristic special opps game and is fun to play. All the different weapons and special abilities of the character makes for some very creative fighting. I would like to see a second series of this game.
5,WoW!1,"I really like this game. I got the game for my birthday and I've been playing it since!The game has tons of different enemies like robots and tanks and helicopters. There are also cars and stuff for you to drive around in!My dad won't let me play online, but my friend say it's really fun!I hope everyone else likes this game too!"
3,Worth playing,"This game gets off to a slow start, but once you start racking up bio-abilities (slow time, shield, invisibility) it gets more fun. Yes, there are better PS2 shooters out there, but if you're like me, you've already played them all (Black, Cold Winter, Everything or Nothing, COD, MOH, Navy Seals, Spliter Cell, Max Payne, The Matrix, etc, etc...). I've been searching for games I've overlooked, like this one. While I won't say this is a ""great"" game, it's not bad once you get a few levels into it. If you can find it cheap, check it out."
1,Blindingly Boring,"The game play on the PS2 version of this game was incredibly disappointing. The graphics are also a bit dated. There is just nothing about this game that makes it worth buying -- or even playing. If you want a great shooter that is just fun to play, stick with ""Black."""
5,Uhh what exactly is Project:SnowBlind?,"Is it some HALO wannabe,or is it a Miltary Shooter,or is it a ""One-man-army"" thing where you fight wars alone(Metal gear Solid/Far Cry)?Just post a review please and tell me if its one of those three-If not..I totally different game.THANQ."
1,Stop the Reprints!,"Because this book is so well known, people buy it regardless of its quality..there are too many of them around. It is garbage. My midwives and my obstetrician both told me to throw it out, not sell it to a used book store but throw it out. They didn't want it falling into the hands of another expecting family and causing unneeded anxiety - which is all its good for. if you are looking for a expecting book buy the birth book by the Dr.s Sears, much more up to date and scientifically based."
2,Not quite as described,"I was a bit disappointed with this product. I thought I was buying a book in ""very good"" condition and when it arrived it was torn, bent and some pages were stained. For the same price I could have bought a new book but I like to recycle books, I will not buy from this seller again."
1,Save your money...,"Superficial and way overpriced. For example, there are no entries at all for psychologists. The first term that I looked up, ""spotlight effect,"" was not included either. Your PSYC 101 text probably has a better glossary."
5,Incredibly beautiful voice...,"... and great interpretations of older -- and newer -- classics. Natalie Douglas can touch upon and sustain a sorrowful note until you wanna cry. She reminds me of another favorite artist of mine, Cassandra Wilson. This CD shows wonderful range not only in notes, but in emotions as well -- a true showcase of a young artist's potential and spectrum. Beautiful instrumentation and backup singing (albeit limited) makes this CD a classic. Thanks for sharing this with us Natalie, and keep 'em coming!"
5,Beautiful,"This novel is at times funny, at other times heartbreaking, but entirely wonderful. It is a shame that Tom Andrews passed away so soon after the publication of this, his first novel. He was a great writer and a family friend who will be missed."
5,Great Reference Tool,"The book, The Fingerprints of God, by Brad Cummings, is a very well written book clearly showing the evidences of God's hand in the universe around us. As Romans 1:20 says, the invisible things of God are clearly seen in creation. In his book, Mr. Cummings presents an irrefutable case for creation by God as opposed to evolution by chance. Though at times the subject matter can get quite technical, it is written in an understandable way, making common sense out of the complicated. It is a great book for your own personal study or for a small group setting. By showing that the scientific evidence actually supports creationism, this book will help restore your confidence in Biblical authority.Donn Hauser"
5,Excellent Defense of Creationism,"Feeling as if I am faced with a world that is very one sided about the approach to our beginnings, I found this book very helpful in explaining our stand on creationism. A great collection of research without putting on airs.Thank you for putting into print , a book that not only I , but my teens can comprehend. My background is in the science field and I grew very weary and frustrated with the dogmatic approach to Evolution. Talk about Faith based ideas! Evolution is taught as fact, but it is more like fiction. Respectfully and sincerely submitted, Linda Elsbree"
3,Sooo Slow,"I am most times a huge fan of PN Elrod. I loved the vampire files, this however was not them. This book was so slow, it took me like a month to read and usually I can whip through a book in a day or so. I am gonna give this side series a second try in hopes that this book was slow cause it was the first one and setting up characters but honestly this a book I would borrow and read before deciding to buy, that is what I will be doing with the second one.As for the story line, it lacks a great deal when compared to some of her other works. The main character is not very likable, for the most part he seems spineless. There is tons of period description but not alot for character, so this is really a book for those into revolutionary war era fiction. Just hoping the next is better, gonna give it a second chance as a series and borrow it from the library."
5,Holds up through years of use,I have three children and my cereal storers have received daily use for over 10 years now. They still function air-tight and we never have stale cereal. Highly recommended investment for those that live in humid climates.
2,Not what you think it is.,"I bought two different cereal storage from Amazon to compare, and this one was the loser.It's small enough to put in the cabinet, but too small for a full bag of cereal. The lid is difficult to put on and the cap is very flimsy as if it will rip off.Shipping was way expensive for the product, so I won't be purchasing another one. I'd go with another one if I were you."
2,Tupperware Review,"At first, I bought this because I have the funds to and am a lazy shopper. Despite all the 5 star reviews, this product did not meet my expectations.PROS:Small, can fit in your cabinet.CONS:ExpensiveExpensive ShippingToo small to fit one standard bag of cerealFlimsy lid that's hard to put on"
4,"Depressing, but Important","This documentary does an excellent job of education one on the plight of Tibet and the Tibetans. I thoroughly enjoyed the interviews with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, various scholars, witnesses and Tibetan monks and nuns.Due to the subject matter, this film a definite downer. My major gripe about it, is that it tells the viewer nothing of what's being done to help the situation. I would have liked some information on any progress the Dalai Lama and others have made towards Tibetan freedom, and information on what various Tibetan-cause groups are doing.Unfortunately, this documentary just presents the problems and does not even hint at a solution of any kind, except from some optimistic comments by Dr. Thurman."
5,The truth about Tibet,I visited Tibet last summer and experienced the amazing Tibetan people and culture whichare rapidly disappearing because of the Chinese. I stayed at a monastery that was slowlybeing rebuilt after being destroyed and the rinpoche murdered in the 1950s. This beautifuland well-made film documented all that happened to the Tibetans during the Cultural Revolutionand made me cry. Why has the west turned its back on Tibet?
2,Another Anne Frank,Zlata's Diary is very typical of many diary's that are being written today. I think that they need to stop making this type of books because Anne Frank was enough and all people will do is relate it to her life. Also throughout this book Zlata shows no emotion and she keeps repeating herself. When she found out that her diary was going to be published she totally changed her style of writing. She should have kept writing how she was and maybe the diary would have been more interesting to read.
2,Not what I expected!,"I'm a senior in high school and have just read Zlata's diary for our historical literature class. Truthfully, I was somewhat let down by the book. It seemed as though with the announcement of her diary's publication, the entries changed from introspective to writing for an audience. Whereas Anne Frank was purely writing for herself, Zlata knew that her diary would be published, making it less impacting on my emotions. Granted, I could never comprehend what she had to go through and I feel for her, her family, and the lost innocence of her childhood. I recommend this book with some reservations."
3,TRIUMPH THROUGH THE TRAGEDY OF WAR,"The story of Zlata Filipovic is a very touching story of a young girl that escaped the terrors of war not just physically, but through writing in her diary which she fondly refers to as ""Mimmie."" This story brings a sense of reality to the wars that we read about in newpapers and watch on TV - it tells the stories of people just like you and me who find themselves caught in the middle of the ugliness of war. Zlata's story has an added sense of innocence to it because it is told through the writings of a child - through her eyes in the way she saw it. Zlata Filipovic is the story of a courageous individual, who as we see in the book along with her fmily managed to escape the horrors of war after writing her story. I feel that her story gives us a similar perspective to that which Anne Frank gave us through the diary which she kept during World War II."
4,Zlata's Story was Sad but not Very Entertaining,"Zlata writes of her experiance in the war. It was a pretty good book, I guess, but it was very hard to keep track of the charicters and who they were."
4,"To me this was book that really was not written that well, b","I t was a story which in many parts was very sad, for being an innocent child being destroyed for the rest of her life because of war, but the book was not that great because Zlata mainly repeated most things over and over. For being in journal form, it was all right."
3,I think Zlata's Diary was very sad at times yet boring.,"Zlata's Diary was very predictible. That is why it is so boring. She repeated the same things a lot. It was sad at times, but had a happy ending."
5,All Great.,"An accurate, and yet an emotional description of civilians trapped in the battlefield of sectarian and age old ethnic hatred. Written by a young teen, who has not yet hidden her objective truthfulness, which adults tend to do.Top quality, fast delivery, great price. It is amazing how convenient it is to buy such worthwhile books, and, unlike a library book, you can keep these purchases for future reference and make notes right in your books."
3,Zlata's Diary,Zlata's Diary is about a young girl's diary named Mimi during the war in her town of Sarajeavo. She writes of the hardships of being a war child. She tells of the changes of her world during the war such as her parents may have grown older one year but looked ten years older. She is constantly hearing of people being shot and wounded. And how might I know this? She was asked if she had a diary. And guess what she did and it was sent to be published. I think this book was over all pretty well written. I would recomend this book to you if you liked the book The Diary Of Anne Frank. So to find out what happens pick up Zlata's Diary.-Christine Lanier
4,Zlatas Diary- a great book Nurdan Mekan,"I loved this book it is about the bosnian civil war, and how she survived it. Zlata is an eleven year old girl and she is keeping a diary about her life in the war. If you want a book about a war get this. I would give it a 4 star because it can be boring sometimes and to repetitive."
5,Zlata's Diary is a clear and concise portrayal war life.,"The book Zlata's Diary is a touching and in- depth portrayal of the life of a scared and innocent child during the war. The details of the day to day living and the suffering they endured are eye opening and frightening. The story is one that should be read throughout schools across the world to bring light to the realities of war. Maybe books like this should also be required for politicians to read when they are sworn ito office. This might create a concern for the people of the world and broaden the politicians' visions on life. The concern for any and everyone's life should come before the selfish political concerns of world leaders. All in all, Zlata's Diary is a clear and detailed portrayal of the life of a helpless family and young girl during the war."
2,"Easy read, but not very interesting.","Zlata's Diary was obviously written by a fifth grader. The vocabulary (may have been changed a little bit by translation) is a little above a fifth grade level, but the sentance structure is the same. In the middle of the book she finds out her diary is going to be published. I think this impacted her writing, because after that she started talking just about the war, not her feelings. If you are interested in the war, not how someone lived through the war, read this book. If you are looking for feelings and thoughts more, read Anne Frank."
3,Gave an accurate review of the effects of war on youth.,"Zlata's Diary was an interesting ""journal"". The perspective on war, provided by Zlata gave a chilling glimpse of reality. Many things that are often taken for granted were assigned great value by Zlata. Her perspectives gave family life and friends new importance. Zlata seems to be older than her eleven years and her writting suggests an older soul. Altough, it seemned as though she didn't endure any personal changes, her world of bliss was changed forever."
3,"not a great book , but a true story","it is not a bad book for a girl of 11 years but I think taht Anne Frank was a better book because she showed her feelings more and she didn't know taht her diary would be published , anywy is good for learn something about what is going on in Sarajevo."
2,A bit disappointed!,"As this book was a diary of a girl which was written during wartime, I think it's boring for her to repeat and repeat the similar miserable comditions of no electricity, water and gas almost everyday.As well as the birthday partiessssss!!These would greatly decrease the extent of compactness.After Zlata knew that her diary was going to be published, her style in writing changed,it became more and more emotional or even made me feel a bit of hypocritical."
5,A window into war.,"Zlata's Diary is a very, very real book. It is about a girl who is in the middle of a war in Sarajevo. I would not suggest this to children, because it is not a 'fun' book to read but is very good and gives you a wonderful appreciation of a child's life in war. If you are looking for an autobiography, I would pick this one up."
2,Lauren's Review For Zlata's Diary - A Little Disappointing,"Zlata's Diary was very disappointing because she kept saying the same thing over and over and over again. The ending was the same as the beginning. All Zlata basically said was, ""Oh no the first day there was no water or electricity!"" Then the next day she would say ""Yay it's back on!""Again, I think that there could have been a little bit more variety of things that happened. I think that if there was it would have been a much better book."
2,Propaganda,"Zlata's Diary is a shameless propaganda ploy. Zlata Filipovic went to live in a Paris villa shortly after the Bosnian civil war started. She lived in luxury and splendor. The real Ann Frank died at Auschwitz. Why is Frank's memory being abused by propagandists? Amazon.com itself noted that the Bosnian Government may have tampered with the book,i.e., organized the propaganda campaign. It is a cute idea! Pretend you are somebody else. It is a form of theft. It insults the memory of the real Ann Frank. If you love PROPAGANDA and being lied to and hoodwinked, you will love this book! There is a sucker born every minute! It ain't real. It is REAL propaganda though.Sorry, I can't recommend it."
2,My Poor Canary,Read this book with several other classmates and found it ridiculous. Zlata's only concern for several pages is that her canary might die because it's too picky to eat what they have.
1,Not worth reading,"I first picked up this book when I was eleven. I liked it because--surprise--I could relate to her. When I tried to reread it yesterday, however, I had to give up. It has absolutely no merits whatsoever. I also disliked Zlata's drawing a similarity between herself and Anne Frank. The comparison is almost laughable. Though I'm inclined to blame someone who has put that idea into her head, not Zlata herself.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Zlata has grown into a decent woman, and I'm sure we all had our delusional moments when we were teenagers, but I'm rating the book here, not the author. And it sucks."
4,Zlata's Diary,"Zlata's Diary, which is an autobiography, is an eye opening story about a young girl's journey during the war in Sarajevo. Her autobiography really shows the struggles she faced and how they made her grow up. Even though this book was at times a little repetitive, it fascinated me and I really learned a lot from it. This book shows people how blessed they truly are, and that they should be grateful for the things they have. Through Zlata's Diary we can catch a glimpse of what life was like in Sarajevo at the time."
4,5th graders [from] Caracas Venezuela,"We are a group of 5th graders ... We just read the book Zlata's Diary and it was a great book and we decided to give a book review to Amazon.com. It is a book about a depressed girl named Zlata who is living through a war. This war has taken away her childhood. She has recorded her daily life through Mimi, her diary. The book was a little confusing because it had so many names of people we did not know. Even though the war is going on Zlata finds a way to bring humor out. We really think you should read this book because it is informative and intrigung. We highly recommend this book to 5th grade and above"
4,A nice read,"I recommend this book. I also liked ""A Tailgater's Guide to SEC Football"". It rocks if you are a die-hard SEC Fan like I am."
1,Save You money - you need common sense,"This book really disappointed me it really did'nt have anything that jumped out at me, that made me say ""O - I forgot about this"" maybe because I'm a SysAdmin I might be more up to date than most. If your lacking common sense then buy this book, but with 30 days or so till 2000 its almost a mute point now."
1,Don't spend the time or money,"I couldn't sit through the entire movie. The quality of the video was awful, it wasn't sexy, the acting was bad, the story incoherent-- need I say more?"
1,Total Crap,Do not waste your time. It looked like someone's college film project. I kept waiting for something to happen. But it never delivered.
1,WARNING! This is a rebranded Linksys GBIC!,"Be careful with this GBIC, it is actually a re-branded Linksys MGBSX1, it will not work in Cisco brand switches."
3,Not much 'fire',"The title is a little deceptive, I think.I was expecting more 'fire' in the music.It's okay, but I have been having a hard time finding anything really good to dance flamenco to.This is the best one I have bought so far though."
2,Disappointed,"This series was purchased as a gift for my brother who is a huge fan of westerns. I had the item shipped directly to him. When it arrived it appeared to have been shipped directly from China, as the packing slip did not contain any English. The DVDs did not appear to be offically labeled. After review of several of the DVDs my brother indicates that they seem very dark and of poor quality. I am in the process of seeing about returning them for a refund."
5,Cheyenne-Television Favourites,"The disc contained a good selection of stories, and allowing for the age of the original series, the sound and picture quality was excellent!The studio should however, be releasing season sets rather than a sampler set(the same applies to F Troop).(...)"
5,Love Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie !,Loved the 1st season DVD series and can't wait for more to be produced. The 50-60's Western shows were the greatest but especially Cheyenne. I was and still am a fan of his calm demeanor and good looks.
3,"""War Party"" is not an episode on this DVD","I wish the episodes and the season that they appeared was available in the description of this item.I purchased this DVD because ""Kid Reviewer"" submitted a review of the episode ""War Party"" with stars Angie Dickinson and James Garner.I was disappointed to find that ""War Party"" was not an episode on this DVD.The 3 episodes included are: ""The Storm Riders"" (Season 1),""The Trap"" (Season 2),""The Young Fugitives"" (Season 6)."
3,Cheyenne - The First Season,"The basic show I remember and remember well from the 1950's and early 1960's and enjoyed it along with a number of the other so-called ""oaters."" It was nice to see at least one season again but these were disappointing in a number of ways and it may very well not be the fault of the current copyright owner. And that is they are all around 40 minutes in length and the theme was different than I had ever heard before, not that shows were beyond changing their theme. The old reliable theme which I was most familiar with was not there and at the very least there should have been some sort of explanation. There wasn't even an explanation that this show alternated with others and therefore was NOT on each week for some 6-8 months of the year for every week. Now, let's see the next few seasons along with the best of them all Maverick which warner has to know is a real gold-mine. If they wait much longer to release it, all who remembered it will be deceased."
2,Not Impressed.,"Although not an avid fan, I found there are some excellent Westerns out there made in 50's to 70's era. I watched this the following evening after I had watched ""Maverick"" the evening before. Maverick was most enjoyable, and was looking forward to another entertaining evening with ""Cheyenne"".The acting was terrible. Nothing wrong with Clint Walker, but I felt some of the key supporting actors efforts were a distraction to the extent that I could not tolerate more than 25% into the second episode."
5,Great cookbook!,Michael Chiarello is one of my favorites. His recipes are one's that you would actually cook! Not too fancy and very delicous.
3,Too detailed,"Book had many good recipes, however, it was not a simple read when trying to cook. TMI. Good browsing book, but not ""an easy to use in the kitchen tool."" A little too complicated if you just want quick directions while cooking. Love to watch him on TV, however, recipes seem easier, less complicated."
4,My first Chiarello cookbook,"Bought this some years back. I liked it then, I like it now. The minestrone soup recipe is 'the' one I use. It came out perfectly the first time and each time I make it. Recipes are for home cooks, no 'frou frou,' so the title is perfect--At home recipes that are not intimidating."
5,Exceptional!,"Our cookbook club used this book recently. Ten different dishes were prepared from this book and we enjoyed every one of them. The Roasted Tomato soup with sunny-side-up Croutons is out of this world. Made during tomato season makes it even more delicious. I could eat this soup every day! It is good cold, warm or hot.The book was nice photos and good descriptions to help the cook."
2,It was just OK,"This book is well-written, but it lacks sustainable interest. There's nothing special or memorable about it; the characters, the plot...just an OK read, no keeper."
5,Sad historic story,"After a visit to the French village of Oradour sur Glane in 1988, I read this book about the tragic event that happened there on June 10, 1944. A sad but good read."
5,"Read this before, during, and after ANY war",The author relates a factual time in history but lessons were not learned and so it has been repeated time and time again. I just happened to read it on the anniversary of D-Day but it caused me to remember Vietnam and most certainly Iraq and what is done by soldiers following orders.
1,They Wasted their money on this production,Halle Berry? Eye candy is about all. The production smooths the edges and takes all the poetry out Hurston's classic tale.
4,My daughter told me I'd like this and. .,"I did. It was a good movie. . basically takes you through what every woman encounters until she finds the one that makes her feel liberated. .it was sad though, which is another pearl of life. .sometimes you get something great and it's taken away from you. Good movie though, I'm glad I have it in my collection."
5,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"This was an excellent movie. The love between Janie and Teacake is all consuming. It will live with you forever and maybe searching for your own Teacake. I enjoyed each actor in their character roles. The quality of the DVD was superb. I would recommend reading the novel. The title is, ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"", by Zora Neale Hurston."
2,It's okay. It's not bad. It's ............ okay.,"I'd say the book is probably in my Top Twenty Favorite Books list. The thing that the movie's missing is the narration. In the book, there's two distinct personalities : Janie as she's growing and Janie as Narrator. It's the sheer presence of the narrator in the book that makes it. It's Janie looking back at her life and explaining the inner dialogue and why she did what she did, and what she learned from it. That's distinctly missing from the movie. They tried to blend the two and take out the narration for the majority of the story, and that was the mistake.It's.... okay. It's not great. If you haven't read the book, you'll probably like the movie. If you've read the book, well, you'll see what I mean. It's still worth watching the movie as Halle Berry's performance is very well done. There's just a lot missing in the production of the film."
3,Their Eyes Were Watching Goddess Halle Berry,"For those who love the book, this isn't too bad. While it follows the book it is very very good. At roughly the point where Janie leaves with Teacake, the story diverges from the book's tone and concentrates more on Halle Berry. While beautiful to watch, this concentration on her detracts from the focus on Janie and Teacake's relationship and how this relationship frees her. The migrant workers' camp is portrayed more like a peace and love '60's commune, and it appears that this is what makes her feel free. Disappointing."
1,Their eyes were waching God,I really can not rate tis product because It will not display - - -play the movie for me to watch...I sure would like to sent this item back and get another one....I really really wanted to watch and keep this movie....Bad
3,Movie,This was a gift that a friend had requested that she would like. So ordered for her birthday and was happy.
5,Lyrical,"There is a certain lyrical beauty about this film. A thinly veiled Hurston lives vicariously through Janie, who wanders through life looking for a man who will bring her fresh strawberries and go fishing by moonlight--and she finds him in Tea Cake.Oprah's intro to this film is telling when she says that a woman can die happy after being kissed by a man like Tea Cake.In short, the film is masterfully filmed, character-driven and true to the era of the story."
2,Their Eyes Were Watching God...NOT!!!,"I didn't enjoy the movie because I expected it to be more like the book which was way more interesting. The book had so much more detail it gave more examples, more to imagine. There's a part in the book were it shows a Ms. Turner, but in the movie there was no Ms.Tuner. Another part is when he has to bury dead bodies it shows nothing about that in the movie. The movie cuts out a lot of parts that were in the book. Maybe if i would of just saw the movie it would have been better, but since I read the book first I expected more scenes."
1,Disappointing.,"This is my favorite book of all time. I'm also a huge fan of Halle and Oprah, but I found this to be a very bad adaptation of the book on many levels. It was just bad. I have no idea how one would receive this movie without reading the book, but it left out so much of the book. It lacked the emotional depth. And the saddest thing is that when I first read this book in 1993 that Halle Berry would make the perfect Janie. I still think I'm right. And the fact that this was done in 2 hour movie was an atrocity. This should have been a miniseries. I still applaud Oprah for bringing Zora's work to the masses."
2,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"The movie wasn't a good portrayal of the book. It lacked details that were vital to the whole story. When you read literature you are able to grasp the whole story and a portrayal of it could have more details, but it should never lack details. While watching the movie I was able to point out the movies qualities and flaws and how different and alike they were. ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" DVD got the basic idea of the book , but the details that are missing give it a two thumbs down on my behalf. In the book when Janie Mae Crawford meets Tea Cake and they begin to become comfortable with each other , Janie leaves behing her mourning in black and starts to wear blue( being that this is Tea Cake's favorite color). In the book this was a way of showing Janies' change in attitude. These details along with many others weren't apart of the movie which threw me off and i truly disliked the movie. Some parts were exaggerated, others just weren't there!"
3,Their eyes were watching god,"In the movie their eyes were watching god there were a couple of differences and a couple of similarities. Like in the book and in the movie she had three husbands Logan, Joe and Tea Cake. Some diffrences are that in the movie she wasn't sitting under the pear tree like they described in the book. And in the movie tea cake did't hit her like he did in the book. In the book he didn't gamble the money, he spent it at a party and then got it back by gambling. And ms. turner was never in the movie. I think that the book is much better than the movie because it has more detail."
4,A Woman Figthing to find her True Love,"The movie ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" i think deserves a 4 stars even if it had some differences from the book like: they never talk about her trail to see if she was innocent or guilty, Tea Cake never hit her and didn't show jealousy in the movie. In the Movie they didn't have the Characters Mrs.Tuner or her brother. But even all these differences it still had the same feeling as the book. It showed all her 3 husbands how Tea Cake made her feel, how Joe made her wear a rag on her hair, and etc.. This is why the movie deserves a 4 star rating. It changed a few things but it never changed the theme. Thanks for listening to Angie and Beba."
5,Great Classic!,I bought the movie to show my English 3 (H.S. juniors) class after we read the book and they loved it!
3,Read The Book,"As movies go- this one is no exception. It is like many movies when they are translated from book to screen, most of the really good parts or explanations which provide detail insight are left out as if the viewers can't handle the deep rooted statements engulfed by the author. The actors in this film gave good performances. I will say to anyone wanting to purchase this film, if you have read the book forget watching the movie, it will only leave you hurt and disappointed. If you have not read the book then by all means by the movie, you are sure to enjoy it!"
4,Decent,This is a decent documentary but didn't stand out as one of the better ones. It's only 40 minutes long.Recommended: Animals are Beautiful People
3,Disappointing by 2009 standards,"Not bad, but the video quality is disappointing by 2009 standards. Some of the scenes are OK, but most are not up to Blu-Ray quality. Also, it is a bit heavy on wildebeasts and light on other animals. Overall, worth a look, as long as you are not expecting state of the art video quality."
3,ok-but more talking than promised.,ok video but there are less pictures than expected. I am ok with it but it seems like the person copied other videos.
3,Rated NOT,"This is not a comment on video quality nor producer's skill. Just a warning. Often folks buy animal stories - and now videos - for young kids. Indeed, one great naturalist recently bemoaned that in a test of identification, most young children cannot identify real animals - only the cartoons. This kind of video would seem like a natural remedy.But somehow the psyche of the producer is fixed on the 'cycle of life' (translation: one animal ripping another animal's throat out). We have to make a distinction between real educational value (How much land does a carnivore require? What is the ecology mix here? What weather or land qualities are at play?) vs. an animal snuff movie.I am not sure this video has made that leap of insight.Not for tots."
2,A glorified TV animal documentary,"Kinda boring. Like a nature show on TV.The IMAX experience sadly lacking.Even the scenery is sorta bland. Lots of savanna land, and aerial shots of savanna land, and animals running on savanna land. Animals mating, and eating one another in the savanna. Rivers flowing through savanna land. The director also goes a bit overboard with the fish-eye lens on the camera.Perhaps the film is mis-titled? How about, ''Gnu's of the Savanna?""National Geographic puts this one to shame."
3,Wildebeast frenzy,"This movie is ok for a documentary. It is meant to show life on the serenghiti and has James Earl Jones narrating. However, this movie showcases, primarily, the great, annual Wildebeast migratation. I know how important this migration is to all life on the African plains, but come on! It spends only about 5 minutes, randomly, on other animals. What about the display of male African elephants during breeding season? Or Jaguars carting food in trees to hide from other predators? How about the structured but seemingly chaotic feeding of Crocs? Nope, wildebeast dominate this movie. If you want a movie on migration, this is it. If you want a movie that showcases a variety of animals and behavior, look somewhere else."
2,Below National Geographic quality,"If you have seen any of the many National Geographic titles on Africanwildlife, you may find that IMax's Serengeti leaves a lot to be desired interms of story telling, focus on wildlife and scientific knowledge. IMaxmovies are shot on larger than normal film to achieve very high resolutionand smoother color transitions which will only be noticable when projectedon giant movie screens. When the film is transferred to DVD and viewedon your much more inferior and small TV (as compared to projected film),all of the IMax advantage is totally lost. This goes for all IMax titles.If you only want to see random scenes from animal life in the Serengeti,you might like it. Otherwise, first consider the many National Geographictitles about African wildlife (even on VHS) some of which have won awards."
5,Nice viewing,"A lovely spectacular work of a natural beauty Kenya and Tanzania offer a world.Nice music, interesting technical stuff, not so long."
3,Falls short for Blu-ray nature documentary,"I bought this Blu-ray product along with several other nature-type documentaries such as Mysteries of the Nile, Ganges, galapagos, Living Sea, and Planet Earth. The quality of picture falls short of others I viewed. I still enjoyed it as I love the Serengeti, but felt it does not rate a 4+ rating compared to others out there."
4,The book Cocktails and Punches,This book teaches your many new and common ways to makes drinks it tells you ever thing you need to know!
4,Quirky and original,"Lily Allen is fresh and exciting. She really is one of a kind. Love the song, ""Alfie"", which is very funny. She writes great lyrics. ""Nana, You're a Window Shopper"" is excellent, too."
5,A+++++++++++,"She has a soulful, reggae wonderful voice. I can't stop listening to her. she really sings from what she feels. The one thing I didn't realize when I bought it was that it said parental advisory. She does say the f. word a lot. So I recomend to buy the clean version. Other than that really really good. BUY IT!!!"
4,Great album...bubbly beats...overall happy tunes,"Such a great artist! Didn't expect much but really had to give it a listen and I am just absolutely in love with Lily Allen! Hope to see her in concert one day!If you give this a chance, the album is a great pick me up on a down-in-the-dumps day. Her bubbly ecletic beats with witty lyrics can't help but put a smile on your face. With songs such as ""Knock-Em Out"" and the American release ""Nan, You're a Window Shopper"" you can't help but laugh at what she sings about. Lily Allen definitely is not one to be subtle about topics as she sings much more then the cliche love song.Favorite tracks:THE WHOLE ALBUM...rarity to discover an album where you like every song..."
3,"Funky Hip - ""Pop""","This album is a genre blending cornakopeia. First and foremost is her roots in british hip-hop, some might say she is the female counterpart to Mike Skinner of the Streets, however I am not a huge fan of hip-hop therefore I will not wax intelligent about it.There are a few pure pop songs on here with ""Smile,"" ""LDN,"" and to some extent ""Alfie."" These are really good pop oriented songs that deserve more air play than what is actually being played. She even has some reggae influence in her music.It wasn't great, but then again, I'm not a huge hip-hop fan."
4,Cynical yet cheery,"As a cynical yet cheery girl myself, I really enjoyed this album. Catchy, pop tunes filled with thoughtful and/or witty lyrics really make you stop and listen. It's one of those CDs that I can play over and over again without getting sick of it."
5,Love This Album!,"Lily is a rare talent! She infuses wit and humor in a variety or styles making it eminently enjoyable to listen to from beginning to end.The current US mainstream acts are SO LAME, more about image and making a fast buck than any real substance. For this reason, I tend to look more into international acts such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Camera Obscura, Jens Lekman and Duffy, just to name a few. Even Amy Winehouse before rehab!"
4,Surprisingly entertaining and hugely enjoyable,"Being from the United States I didn't get blasted by the Lily Allen phenomenon that took over England after the ""Queen of MySpace"" debuted her first single ""Smile"" and debut album to the music world. Sure, MTV played the music videos and I heard occasional talk about the girl who came out of nowhere (well, the Internet is more like it), but I didn't really pay too much attention. But the infectious, albeit repetitive sounds of ""Smile"" permeated through my ears recently and I was drawn to the British pop star, and I ended up buying her CD. The album contains a good share of great songs, including the hilarious bro-bashing ""Alfie"" and ""Not Big,"" and although Lily lacks powerful chops her sweet coo suits her individual style quite well. Lyrically, you can't get anything more entertaining - or, at times, odd - than here, but, again, that suits Lily's personality perfectly as an outspoken, unabashedly unique singer-songwriter with an excellent debut."
3,Sweet & Salty,"Lily Allen's Alright, Still is a highly listenable debut album. The British singer juxtaposes bright sunny sounds with vindictive (although done with her tongue firmly planted in her cheek) lyrics. The song ""Smile"" stands out head and shoulders from the rest of the album. It is pure musical cotton candy, but a great single that has an extra catchy chorus about how seeing her ex-boyfriend cry makes her smile and a finger snapping beat. The rest of the album is made up of similar ex-boyfriend put downs, but none as catchy as ""Smile""."
5,This CD makes me Smile! :),"Excellent CD. Lily Allen is a truly talented singer! Her songs are a mix of pop, regagge, rock, and rap. The lyrics are funny and don't make any sense at all but that's what makes it fabby. I hope she comes out with another CD!"
4,Smile - (almost) Everything's Just Wonderful,"I found Corrinne Bailey Rae early on the same way: as a 2005 promising artist on the BBC web site. Lily Allen lives up to the hype with her creative, down-to-earth lyrics (the curse words are not just to jar) and creative head-bobbing melodies. The variety in the songs, including reggae and reggaeton influences (not sure how the latter would have reached her) and hints of Arctic Monkeys enthusiasm make this an excellent collection that should work it's way up the sales chart. It's much more interesting and captivating - ""Nan, you're a window shopper"", ""Smile"" and ""Not big"" for instance - than the predictable pablum from freshly anointed American Idols. Well done, Lily! It's not easy to produce a fresh sound these days and we all need a good chuckle to improve our day."
3,"No, it isn't your headphones ... it really is distorted","I like almost every song on this CD, but it can nonetheless be painful to listen to because the entire album sounds distorted due to the choice made when mastering to go with loudness over quality. A shame, really ... it's a great listen otherwise."
5,Lilly Allen's LDN music composed by colombian,"I was thrilled when I listened the ""LDN"" track from this album and I recognized the music from an old recording from Colombia, South America called ""Cogeme la caña"" loosely translated as ""Grab my sugar cane stick"" recorded in 1954 by colombian record label Discos Fuentes. [...].Jaime Jaramillo"
2,WAY TOO HYPED!,"I saw Lily Allen play a gig in Boston and I had never heard her music before. I thought she was cute and her music was very upbeat- i was glad i got a chance to see her live. After the concert, however, I went home and downloaded this CD and i HATE it. Her voice gets annoying and the songs all sound the same after a while. She is definitly better live, and that probably has to do with her visual appeal. Take that away and she has little."
4,Buying the cd,"The first I have ever heard or seen of Lily Allen was on Saturday Night Live last night and I thought she was fabulous. Lovely, lilty voice, cute delivery of some less than cute lyrics, without TRYING to be cute. I liked what I saw and heard and plan to buy this cd."
3,Fun bubblegum pop,"A fun CD from a cheeky, cute Brit. Most of the songs are about guys trying to pick her up, or guys she's dumped, or how she's going to pay the rent, or riding her bike through town - all things that I'm sure are high priority if you're a cute 20 year old girl. Still, even those of us that are older (or men, or not British) can enjoy this."
3,"Catchy, but I'd never want to meet her","Lily Allen has released a CD with a unique sound, and the 21 year old seems to have a lot to say... but nothing positive. She lacks tact and attacks everyone-- from random people she meets to her own brother""LDN"" documents a girl who is riding her bike through town only to see horrible things going on around her, and doesn't seem to do anything about it. ""Not Big"" and ""Smile"" are obviously about an ex whom she derives pleasure from demeaning. She even resorts to mocking her own brother in ""Alfie"".She can release a catchy CD, but this girl is really mean spirited. I'm not liking the youth these days and their negative attitude. Someone needs to remind Lily Allen that if she didn't have famous parents, she wouldn't have a CD out and thus maybe she should be grateful for what she has and stop being so cruel to everyone around her."
1,spice girls + kylie minogue - talent = lily allen,"insipid pop drivel at it's finest. i'd heard so much about lily allen that i decided to check this out. ranks right up there with dido & regina specktor. ugh. here's an idea, how about trying out two other new albums that are actually good, like amy winehouse or the cat empire."
3,Don't tell anyone?,"Yo. I got this album down in the city this summer after hearing her single..Smile.I liked that tune. It was like finding out about the Spice Girls before anyone else knew. But she is better than the Spice Girls. Kind of. In a way.So I bought the import. And popped it in with my bros riding out of town.They started making fun of me, calling a big jerk, and that I had bought a ""gril"" album. It was true. i'm a little embarrassed...but hey.It's got some killer tracks on it as far as pop goes. Maybe 3.the rest is plain awful. Mad bad.But USA get ready for Lilly Allen. We loves Bombs and Steve Martin, so this is just prime to take over the universe...Lilly never hurt anyone.But I don't pull the album out too much.I just bought it to be cool.And I found out I wasn't.I was just a big jerk."
5,Best in a long time,"This is a fantastic album; fun, original, great hooks and lyrics that make sense AND you can understand. There has been a lot of hype ( Blender magazine listed it as the #1 album to look forward to in 2007 ) THEY WERE RIGHT! If you don't buy this album, you are missing out."
5,Lily Allen Music,Lily Allen is a witty rage-filled artist whose music is both danceable and hilarious to listen to. The skanking beats are just what her lyrics are meant for.
3,"Amazing, fresh and lively","I don't know what it is about her she is bizarre, a mix between Macy Gray and Regina Spektor with a little bit or Tori Amos spunk and even with the slightly spice girl hint of attitude replication, lily is amazing. She isn't as fake as everything else out there and she is adorable which makes you want to squeeze her cheeks and say it's alright love. The tunes are just catchy."
5,Amazing - buy this album,"I love this album!(and I dont usually buy modern nor popular music)I listen to old school 1980s goth/punk/ska/electro and this sort of mixes them all in a great upbeat sound.Her voice, attitude, accent, skanin' beat, and social commentary, range from sweet to angry but is always fun!!I love the contrast of the serious lyrics with upbeat music.And every song is different, this is not the same song over and over with different lyrics.Warning - these songs get stuck in your head - but in a good way!"
4,"Cool, Ska inspired Britpop","This album is so much fun, her lyrics are catchy and the music is really good.Since she has such a pleasant sweet soudning voice you'll love it over the bass heavy beats and witty lyrics. I bought the clean version and it's been in the rotation ever since. Artists like her should be HUGE over here jugding from the success of Gwen Stefani. If you like Gwen you'll really like Lily, she's a few steps above her lyrically and musically but you'll hear a lot of the same ska influences."
5,like summertime,"I purchased this disc on a whim a couple weeks ago. I was feeling under the weather and stopped into Target for some cold remedies, but I walked by the music section and saw Lily Allen's CD. I remembered hearing a song by her that I liked on our local indie station, but couldn't remember what it sounded like. They only had one copy, so I picked it up. I am SO GLAD I did. The music is insanely catchy and upbeat, even when the subject matter is a bit more grim. The lyrics are clever - much moreso than most American pop acts offer. I'm also a female musician, so I tend to be very picky about music from female artists, but Alright, Still surpassed all my expectations. The best part is, the day after I bought this CD was the coldest day of the year here in Minnesota...but I popped in this album and was mentally transported to summer in the tropics. Lily Allen is fantastic!"
5,Freshmen album shows a fresh new artist,"The first thing you think of when listening to this album is The Streets. Witty lines, British accents, and plenty of self lamenting may get many listeners thinking it's a female brit hip-hopper. But listen a little longer, and you'll realize it's a fusion of both hip-hop and brit pop. In this album, the producer makes sure that the sounds are unique and the hooks stay lasting in your head."
5,fun music,"Lily Allen has an ""off the wall"" sense of humor in her music. The music itself is upbeat and very versitile. It is also easy to sing along with. She is just a fun vocalist to listen to."
5,AWESOME,"One of the best albums I have purchased in a long time. Unlike many albums out there, every song sounds different."
3,Typical BritPop,"The latest in a grand tradition of singa-a-long British Pop. This year's female version of George Formby. Harmless fluff and easy to tap your feet to but repetitive after a few songs. One more one hit wonder; for ""Smile"" think ""My Boy Lollipop"".My Grandchildren will sing it to me in my local pub 20 years from now!"
3,What is the Big Deal?,"Not sure what all the hype is about in all the magazines. They talk like she is the best thing coming since sliced bread. I am not trying to diss her, her songs are not bad. I just think the hype is a bit overrated and unwarranted. I bought this after reading articles in Entertainment Weekly. They love her music. I guess they got my hopes up too high and when it did not meet my expectations, I was disappointed."
4,"Alright, Lily Allen is just great!!!","The first time I listened to Lily Allen was this year, in her album It's not me, it's you. Loved her music, her lyrics and the rythm, not too slow, not too loud. Perfect for listening meanwhile I'm reading. Then I looked for more of Lily Allen here and found Alright, Still. She has her style, and doesn't lose it. Great songs, many of them already became favorites, and the cd has 4 stars in my itunes :)Amazing cd!!"
4,"Lily Allen - Alright, Still...","When I first put this CD in, I thought to myself, ""I've heard these first two songs before"". They sound an awful lot like most of the The Streets' last 3 albums, especially ""Knock Em Out"" (#2). So initially, I was a little leery of her trying to be the female version of one of my favorite groups, The Streets.Luckily, she mixes it up a bit after the start. There are a lot of good songs on here - there are no terrible must-skip tracks on here. Every song is entertaining. It appears that she writes her own lyrics, and they're quite good so points for that. The production is great on this album (better than The Streets). The beats are dub and garage with some pop thrown in.All in all, it's tremendously effective. She's very catchy without ever being corny. A very solid, surprising debut."
5,Surprisingly fun reggae pop,Didn't buy this for a long time and was very pleased with the pop reggae beat. Many more songs are actually much more interesting than SMILE. Very British in their own pop/club way with funny lyrics. Kind of the Katy Perry of the UK (in a way).
2,Possibly the worst remote I've ever encountered,"Okay, I got this to play DVD+R discs I'm burning from a DVD recorder. It plays them fine. My biggest complaint - and it's a deal-breaker for me, is the remote control is so poorly designed. It doesn't fit my hand at all & the button layout is awful. Do they ever actually test these products with human beings before they turn them loose for production?"
1,Colors washed out ! Whites are grayish.?,"Believing I was going to get a bit better picture from these cables to play Smash Brothers Brawl I got the colors washed down.I changed the settings to 480P, re checked all cables in proper spots, and all else. The sharpness did improve a bit however the colors were so washed out. Whites looked grayish.I popped in the original cables that came with the Wii and the colors popped up beautifully again. I am assuming I must have received a defective product. White colors should be white- not gray...Question- when I chose the 480P and wide screen settings- not sure why the Smash Bros Brawl game stayed in the square se3tting.. I though it was supposed to use up the whole wide screen. I made all necessary changes to the tv, console, game to use the wide screen 480P method. Who knows.I'll be asking for Amazon to re send me new ones however can't recommend because they're totally useless ."
2,Not necessary,"I was told by the manager in the EB Games store near me that this item was not necessary for my HDTV. He said they had the TV in the store hooked up to the system and it was not a noticeable difference. I don't know if that would be true for other HDTV's but mine works fine without it,,,I just figured it might be even better but i'm not missing anything."
1,Sadly Dissapointed,"My complaints have nothing to do with the quality of this cable but with the ""component"" image you receive when turning on progressive scan on the Wii. In my opinion while the image may be a little sharper on my 42 inch 720p capable display it actually looks worse than interlace because of the pixilation you can now see."
1,Wii HD Cables,"I would love to be able to use these without having to unplug my Cable TV on my HDTV. We have been able to get no support from the cable company on a splitter or how to use these.The company, seems like a decent company and I would look to them to buy other items, and I have to admit, I have NOT contacted them for support on this product, but at this point, this product sits on a shelf collecting dust because it's a major waste of time and energy, to move our 37"" tv every time we want to Wii in HD... When you work over 50 hours a week, and just want to Wii for a few hours when you get home, it's too much of a hassle."
5,Big improvement,"Wow - the image quality greatly improved through the use of this cable. I plugged in the cable, set the output of the Wii to 480p, and was impressed with the results. Images were crisper and there was a noticeable increase in color range.I have the Wii hooked up to a large (52"") HD, LCD projection TV and was not very happy with the original image. Shadows lost details and images had a blur to them. Switching from the included cable to this cable really seemed to improve things. Others noticed it too. I know others have mentioned about banding, I haven't noticed any of this. Highly recommend."
4,Good Cable at good price,"Unlike some other reviewers I definitely noticed a difference switching from composite video to component and changing the Wii setting to 480p on my 16 X 9 TV. While the cable length is good, those who might want to run the audio cables into an amp or receiver might be out of luck as they are no longer than the video cables. If you are just going from the Wii to your TV it's not a problem. Don't be swayed but other Wii component cable offers that cost up to 3 or 4 times as much."
4,"Sturdy cable, hard to tell the difference in qualtiy","The Wii runs in 480i mode when using the included composite cable. Once this component cable is attached, a new menu option appears in Wii Setup which allows you to select 480p mode. I really couldn't tell that much difference between the old and new cable using Sports, Rabbids and Zelda, but I'm going to keep the cable anyway. Perhaps it's just that 480i and 480p don't look much different on a large LCD monitor (which I have) or my set is somehow up-coding it to 480p already. The cable itself is quite heavy and sturdy and this price is about half of what it is offered for on other sites."
3,Wii Component SCAM,"Be careful when you order the Wii component by Mad Catz under this item that's under $10. I received a 6 ft-gray no brand name cheaply made cable in a plastic bag, which looks like the one made by HandHelditems cost $0.01. I had ordered this cable before $19.99 through Amazon and it came 9.8 ft-white in a factory sealed box by Mad Catz. I was disappointed with my purchase. I didn't want to exchange for another one because it cost me $4.05 shipping to send it back. Anyway using component, the picture quality improved a little. Make sure to change your Wii console setting to 480p."
2,Not a great product. I prefer the Nintendo brand component video cables.,"I used my SDTV's component video input with my Nintendo Wii connected via this MadCatz cable. Using this cable provided a significant increase in picture quality over the standard composite video cable however, the connectors are a little on the cheap side. The wire itself is also a rather flimsy high gauge. After about a month of use, the Cb cable developed a short. I've never seen a cable fail like this without being tampered with in some way.This MadCatz component cable is not the best solution available for the Wii. I recommend the Nintendo's own component cable. It's more robust and delivers good performance for the price."
3,One annoying problem...,The cable doesn't split out with much separation for the audio/video connectors making it impossible to plug the component connectors to my TV and the audio connectors to my stereo. I had to buy extenders for the audio pair to reach my receiver. Component does look better on my TV (Samsung DLP) so overall it was worth it. It would work fine if you are connecting the audio to your TV or your receiver accepts component video.
2,Didn't really improve things...,"These cables didn't really improve the picture after I upped the Wii's settings. In fact the text was worse. So even if the picture is better, the text wasn't.Save your money and just buy a new game."
5,Just like the real thing - only cheaper!,Works just like the Nintendo brand cable - only 1/3 the price!Highly Recommend!
2,WARNING: May create green screen problem.,"With proper settings enabled the cable increases the refresh rate of the picture and looks nicer. However, over random periods of time, the cable will cause the screen to appear in a green shade or hue. The only way to fix this is to completely unplug the cable and replug all of the components. During this time, the sound also becomes distorted. Its like it switched one of the color channels with on of the sound channels.Besides turning the screen green, which is making me buy another cable, the construction of these seems semi-durable. The only thing I don't like about it is the RCA plugs don't hold as well as standard ones."
4,"Great product, Great Price","After reading the reviews, some of which were negative, I was hesitant about buying these component cables. I'm glad I did. These cables improved the picture and video quality, which makes me question the reviews that claim otherwise?"
5,works well,"Cable suplied with wii gave a really poor picture - I suspect because it was badly shielded and I've got a lot of video/audio/computer gear around the wii. The Madcatz cable made a huge difference, and picture quality is now way better and sharper. Obviously not quite full HD, but definitely worth the investment."
4,NO complaints so far...,"I had the wii for over a year before purchasing component cables, but I have been pretty happy with the results...there is a clear difference in picture quality with the hi-def cables. Although, I do feel like the price tag is a little high for some of these cables, this madcatz product is reasonably priced."
3,Decent cables for the price.,"Picked these cables up when they were on Deal of the Day for $9.99. The difference in picture quality is marginal. Text does look noticeably better, especially in the Internet Channel. However, for whatever reason, Mii's don't look very good. If I would have purchased these cables for $20 I would have been disappointed, but for $10 I'm content with the purchase. I just don't think the difference in picture quality warrants a $20 purchase."
1,Durability Issues,The product worked out of the box and then died a couple of months later. And yes everything in the media center is surge suppressed and there was no trauma to account for the failure. I ended going back to the standard cables and haven't decided my next move. Will try and figure out how to get the cables replaced by MadCatz.
3,"Better, but not great","Obviously the Wii's strong point isn't graphics, so the component cable only marginally improves the image quality. I play the Wii on a projection system equivalent to approx. a 100"" standard TV, so any lack of image quality on that will be magnified."
3,Audio woe,"Do not buy if your analog audio ports are not directly next to your video in ports. My speaker is 1 foot away yet cannot connect it. I ended up taking apart a old dvd player, extracting it's audio inputs and wiring it into a old RCA cable to extend the wires.It's one long cable, then it's split at the last five or so inches, impossible to remove without splitting and splicing the actual wire. Otherwise quality is good. Nice sturdy and expensive feeling quality. Image quality is how I expected it to be."
5,These cables work fine,No problems at all with these cables. They work exactly as advertised. I'm not sure why you would pay more for other cables that do exactly the same thing.
5,Wii HD Component Cable,The Wii HD Component Cable works very well and as advertised. The cable is a good length and will be easy to hide!
3,Madcatz Wii HD Component Cable,"Works as advertised, nice packaging. The cable is a bit different than the picture shown. The cable pictured has all five connections going to one 'joint'. He cable delivered is separated into two, video and audio. This is a bit better if your audio video connections are separated from one another."
3,"Cable Works, Resolution Improvement Not Great","Wii HD Component CableIt is always important to use the highest resolution cable available (i.e. For video, HDMI / DVI is better than Component, Component is better than RGB etc.)HD is a misnomner for this cable because the resolution improvement is minimal compared with not using it. This is a Wii issue, not a cable issue. Consequently, was relieved that I choose this much lower priced component cable than paying more for a Wii cable and then being dissapointed.This resolution problem became even more obvious when recently viewing streaming Netflix over Wii on a 1980 x 1024 TV."
3,A Reasonable Alternative to the Official Cable,"Functionally, this cable has performed without issues on my Wii for a few years now. The build quality is great too so I have no worries about it lasting longer. Price-wise, it is half the price of theOfficial Wii Component Video Cablebut it is also twice as much as some other 3rd party cables with similar ratings on Amazon which have become available since I bought this one. For that reason, I can't really recommend this cable very highly nowadays."
3,Works but...,"The difference between component and composite is definitely noticeable on HD screens and this cable does it's job. But, it's kinda flimsy and I had to kind of bend the wires and twist the connectors sometimes to get the right colors to come out on the tv."
1,Color fades in and out,"Was really excited about these cables. My son and I were playing Super Mario brothers when about 20 minutes into the game the 'red' disappeared from the screen. I unplugged the cable from the Wii and plugged back in and it fixed it for about 3 minutes, repeated this several times. Finally got tired of this and plugged in the original RCA cable that came with it and no issues. When it was working the picture was definitely clearer. In good faith I am requesting a replacement. Everyone gets a lemon from time to time."
2,This is not a Karaoke CD,"In my opinion, this is a plain accompaniment track CD, not a karaoke CD. It is not recorded in the CD+G format used with a karaoke CD - it does not have the words on screen. I was very disappointed. However, it is a high quality recording."
1,The First song title is wrong,"the first song is called""No one mourns the wicked...""not THE... just FYIi dont know if that is what the label really says if so id write to them but i am still on the process of loking for their contact info lolbut just so Everyone knows it is""NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED"""
2,Not CDG. NO ONSCREEN LYRICS,"These songs sound good, but it's not a CDG. So you will not get lyrics on your karaoke machine or tv. You will have to know all the lyrics or have the lyrics printed. They should have that stated on the product description. Buyer beware!!!"
4,A better quality!!!,From the moment I played the cd I realized the improvements in the orchestration since the previous karaoke version!Well done and much easier to sing on!
3,Wicked cd,I found this cd a little disapponting. I was under the impression that it was a regular karaoke cd that diplayed the lyrics like the other cd that is not as good quality. I was going to use this so that me and my isister could sing at a karaoke bar and they don't except any cd unless its cdg. I can't beleive i spent $24 on this and i didn't get what i wanted.
2,No Cast to follow along with,"I am not happy with this version of Wicked. My mom took me to new york city to see the show and I loved it. I'm in middle school and I wanted to sing along with the songs for a talent show, but it was hard. This CD should have a cast to sing with, sometimes its hard to know where you are in the music. I will buy the other Wicked album from Stage Stars, they have both singers and just music. Its easier to learn the songs, when there is someone to follow."
4,Is this cd useable for auditons and talent shows?,"I'm singing ""The Wizard and I"" at a talent show next month, does the cd help with that?"
4,Great !,"I absolutely can't understand the bad 1st review:It's a AUDIO-CD (of course it has no lyrics) and the quality is overall impressive. OK, the orchestral soloparts (especially the Intro) can't compete with a full orchestra, but the songs are very close to the Original Cast Album. You can play both at the same time with almost perfect sync & tune.But you will have to buy the Cast-Album too, because it contains the right lyrics, the vocal selection is a completely different version!The only really negative point is the fact that 2 tracks are missing: ""March of the witchhunters"" and the Finale.It's not easy to sing without a conductor, but real fans gonna do it."
1,THIS IS NOT A KARAOKE CD!,"This product shouldn't come up under a keyword search for ""wicked karaoke"". It isn't a karaoke cd at all. It is an instrumental version of Wicked. Period."
2,didnt recieve,"I purchased this book for my step daughter and was very excited about getting it to her. It shipped out and according to usps, made it to the destination. Later I recieved an email stating that it was at the local p.o. But no one could find the misplaced item. Amazon wouldnt help because the post office said it was delivered and neither would the post office because they said it wasn't insured. Well it never gave me that option to insure it or it would have been. I don't know if the book is as good as it is said to be, but I know I was cheated out of my money."
5,A Blues Diva,"Lara Price is a smoldering, sexy blues diva with a great voice in the blues and R & B traditions. She and her former guitarist Laura Chavez form a dynamic duo on this CD, which features mostly original Price & Chavez compositions as well as renditions of older classics."
5,I Got News,"Lara Price has a Great Voice and She can Sing the Blues ... I recommend this Album and if you get to the SF Bay Area, you should see her in concert ... you won't be disappointed."
2,Showing Chickens,"If you, like I, are looking for a detailed instruction for caring for poultry, and don't care very much about the rarefied world of show chickens, this is not the book for you. It is spare on the basics that it proports to teach and seems to go on endlessly about the group itself that produced this film."
5,Very Entertaining!!!,"This was a great season. You don't even have to be a wrestling fan to like this show. I had one of my friends watch it and they hate wrestling and they loved this. When I bought it and started to watch it, I couldn't stop. I almost watched the whole thing all the way through that is how good this is. If you like wrestling or hate it, it doesn't matter because this is very good. It shows people how real wrestling is and how good of shape you have to be in to wrestle. For all of you people who say wrestling is fake, watch this dvd set and then tell me otherwise. I think that everyone should watch this and I guarantee there will be more wrestling fans out there to appreciate this sports entertainment."
5,Great Movie!,This is a great movie classic and the actors are wonderful! I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Natalie Wood so it was great to see them in a fun movie together.
3,Great Ingredients - but it drags :-(,"It should have had some skillful editing to spruce it up. The pie throwing scene, for example, could have had 1/3 to 1/2 the footage deleted and it wouldn't have suffered a bit. Many of the slapstick comedy bits are somewhat overdone and tend to spoil the effect. By the time one encounters the intermission, they may be ready to fall asleep (if they are still awake, that is :-)"
3,"Lots of fun, but not up to Blake Edwards' standard","THE GREAT RACE contains some of the greatest comic elements that can only be created by Blake Edwards. The first part of the film is really great, but when it comes to the imitation of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA, it becomes weaker. Jack Lemmon plays two roles, the mad professor and the idiotic king, the latter being the one I dislike. I just don't feel like laughing when I see him play the king. The most awful scene is the throwing of the cakes - a waste of food, and a waste of the audience's time. The entire episode can simply be cut, then THE GREAT RACE would have been among the best comedies."
1,Bad quality,Love this movie but had to return the DVD because it was of very poor quality. Sound faded in and out and picture quality not up to par. Very disappointed in the product and will try to find it someplace else where I can view it for quality first.
5,"""Push the button Max!!!""","I saw this at Radio City Music Hall along with The Easter Show back when i was a junior in high school. It was presented in 70mm 6 channel stereo sound. Being a music/theatre major it was the music in this movie that impressed me the most. Each character had their own theme music as well as each changing theme as the race would continue from location to location.Of course you could not beat the all star cast, wonderful costumes, great sets and the most unforgetable music ever written.Now i have this DVD and it is wonderful. It is wonderful slap-stick comedy that will never be seen again and this movie is presented in its Roadshow engagement format which includes an ""Intermission"". No matter how dated this film is, you'll still laugh at the wonderful comedy timing that these great actors had."
4,The Great Race,"Classis style humour of the 1960's with classic actors playing consistent character roles. One of my favorite early comedy movies. ""Push the button Max"" will always be in my vocabulary. If you like this one check out ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", another 60's classic."
5,Classically Entertaining,"This is one of my favorite classic movies. This is a very funny and interesting way to see the world and relationships grow between men and women, and even enemies. So many places and people bring this film together in classical style I'm so glad that it was made before big time computer generated action. The Great Race is clean and stylish from the language to the costumes."
5,The Great Race,"This is one of the great old movies. It is car race from New York to Paris around the turn of the 20th century. This is one crazy movie. It has Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Natalie Wood and Peter Faulk. It is 160 minutes long. If you do not like zany movies with lots of slap stick, you may not like this movie. I really enjoyed it."
4,Oldie But Goodie,"This title still holds up well today. It's good clean slapstick humor. I was skeptical when an older friend of mine recommended this one, but I came away from it pleasantly surprised. Reminiscent of a live action Dudley Doright episode. Also features Jack Lemmon in a great performance as Professor Fate."
3,Great Romp,"Very lighthearted movie. The whole familiy will find this entertaining. Good and Evil are humorously shown in silent movie style with Tony Curtis dressed in white with sparkling teeth and eyes and Jack Lemmon in black with Snidley Whiplash moustache and skulking ways. A race around the world is the challenge with many encounters with various countries inhabitants. Good supporting cast with Natalie Wood, Peter Falk, Keenan Wynn, and many other well knowns. Get it on DVD for improved color and sound and extras."
4,Classic,"The Great Race is a hilarious classic movie with Tony Curtis as Leslie. My husbands favorite line from the entire movie is the Professors 'Push the button Max!'. The only thing we weren't to crazy about was that it is a widescreen version. We both prefer full screen but have come to terms with the fastly advancing technology world and their need to sell their products(widescreen televisions). We miss seing these kind of movies on AMC and other channels that play some of the older movies. I is a family entertaining movie without watching for language and nudity or inappropriate behavior. We also purchased, Greystoke: The Legend Of Tarzan, another great classic with a very wonderful story line. It shows a lot about human nature."
4,Must-have for any Natalie Wood fan,"This is the other half of the knockabout comedy duo she starred in with Tony Curtis (see also _Sex and the Single Girl_, which has a multiple-auto chase sequence as zany as any scene in this film). Truth to tell, I spent so much time mooning after Natalie in her gorgeous 1900's costumery - some of the prettiest I've seen in any film set in that period - that I had to back up again and watch the movie to catch all the funny bits."
5,Love It,I have watched this movie many times and bought it so my kids could too. They love it and have watched it many times already. It's great
4,A forgotten little gem,"This Blake Edwards comedy is a wonderful little farce featuring an excellent cast. It may be a little too childish for some viewers. Jack Lemmon as Professor Fate is an obvious Snidely Whiplash surrogate, engaged in futile attempts to best or kill the obnoxiously pure Great Lesley, played by Tony Curtis. Unlike modern farces, The Great Race never veers into filth as filler, so it's suitable for the entire family. It is a long film however, with even an opening overture and intermission. For kids with short attention spans (e.g., all of them), it would be better to show only parts of the film on one viewing. Swashbuckling enthusiasts will enjoy a nice fencing scene involving Tony Curtis and Ross Martin. Try it."
5,I wish real-life crroks were like the villian in this film!,"I lost track of how many times I have seen this film. Fate's evil character combined with his (and Max's) incompentence score points with me. ""Genius Max, positive Genius. What's next?"" ""Car number 5, the engine falls out!"""
5,i like,i like the format it is like being in the theater when played on a big screen tv even down to the intermision
2,Nothing but slapstick!,"This was not as I remembered it from long ago. My wife and I started to view it ( I was especially interested in seeing those wonderful old cars). But we didn't get very far. It seemed to be nothing but slapstick. We looked at each other and agreed to turn it off. May have seemed funny way back, but is just too silly now."
5,Funny and Entertaining,"The Great Race is sure to make your entire family laugh! Professor Fate and his evil and stupid minion Max a Million try to ruin The Great Leslie's extreme dares, but always wind up being defeated by their own ideas. So when the great race from New York to Paris is announced, neither one can pass up the opportunity to win. Follow Professor Fate and The Great Leslie on their crazy and hilarious journey to see who wins, loses, and destroys the Eiffel Tower! I'd seriously recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedies that involve racing."
5,The Great Race,"A great 1960's Blake Edwards film with Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood, with one of many of Henry Mancini's scores! They don't make 'em like this anymore!"
5,True Classic,This is the best of old school comedy. I went to the movies to see this and remember the intermission stage that's actually on this DVD. That was totally cool!!!!
3,1960's Steampunk,"More colorful than the 80's Steampunk, but still the look. Music is vintage...special favorite: ""He Shouldn't-A, Hadn't-A, Oughtn't-A Swang on Me!"""
3,Lavish but stupid,"""The Great Race"" wastes a great cast and a huge budget on a silly premise. As light-headed as it is light-hearted, this is aimed at an audience that considers ham acting and a pie-in-the-face finale absolutely hysterical. If you like your humor to be funny though, look elsewhere."
5,sentimental favorite,The theme song is one of my all-time favorites. The cast is superb and the the whole famiy can watch the movie.
5,The Great Gaggle of Gags,"This is a fantastic video party movie! Fresh and funny even after almost 40 years. My family had the privilege of seeing it first-run in one of Chicago's fabulous theaters. Who can resist Henry Mancini's genius soundtrack, or the beyond-slapstick sound effects (especially with Max as a friar). And the sight gags: look for the mounted back end of a moose in Fate's mansion, and watch for Fate to light a match with his teeth. The way I describe this film to friends? It's like the best WB cartoons all mixed together but done with real people. What other movie can deliver a saloon brawl, a fencing duel, and a pie fight, as well as some of the funniest punchlines in film history? If you want your own variation on more than 2000 pies flying around, try watching the pie fight backwards. And be sure to follow the bouncing ball and sing along with ""The Sweetheart Tree."" (FYI: I own the VHS, not the DVD.)"
4,"""Well, Fiddledy Dee!!...""","For me, this is one of those movies that brings back such fun, wonderful memories from my childhood. This one was an annual favorite in my home, and everytime it appeared in the TV guide we always gathered around the set and had an enjoyable evening. This is certainly not a blockbuster movie by any means, but it is a good movie with clean fun, humor and slapstick. Performances by Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood are good, but my favorites are Jack Lemmon and Peter Faulk who really steal the show.The DVD picture quality is good with plenty of color saturation and contrast. The sound quality is also quite good considering the original audio format. I really enjoy the fact that this DVD also includes the original opening score, intermission, and exit music that was originally shown in the theaters. It would've been easy to cut that out, but it adds to the overall presentation as it was meant to be experienced."
1,Very Upsetting,"The Great Race is one of my all time favorite Movies. I can't see it too many times. But the DVD and the case it came in are very poorly made. You cannot hear the voices talking during the first 20 min. or so of the show. If you raise the volume to hear the voices, the music gets so loud you cannot stand keeping that way. The ""box"" it came in was not the Industry standard all plastic box. It was most made of heavy paper and is wider then my other DVD's, so it will not fit in my DVD file. To sum it up -- I give the movie a full 5 star rating, but I give the DVD and it's pacakging a 1 star rating. That makes me sad..."
5,Does the job!,Hard to find stores locally that still sell all the sewing supplies once in abundance. Thank goodness we can still order these essential supplies.
5,Excellent Recording -especially Poco Alegretto,"JOHANNES BRAHMSSYMPHONY NO. 3 IN F MAJOR, OP. 90ORCHESTRA FILHARMONICA SLOVACCACONDUCTOR ~ LUDOVIT RAJTERTRACKS1. Allegro Con Brio ~ 9:482. Andante ~ 10:203. Poco Allegretto ~ 6:004. Allegro ~ 9:00PLAYING TIME ~ 35:08"
5,Intelligent & Enlightening horse racing information!,Andrew Beyer has been a godsend to horseplayers. He has made it easy to understand and gave us an edge when making selections. Understanding horse race betting and the past performances of horses has opened doors to novice and expert handicappers alike!
4,Very Informative,"Andrew Beyer takes an interesting and analytical approach to picking winners at the track, while his easy style makes this a fun and understandable read. Beyer's biggest contribution is the use of speed figures - horses that show bursts of speed in their last race are usually good bets. There's also valuable information about track conditions and other factors. As one that rarely visits the track, I didn't realize that not every horse entered in a race is expected to seriously compete. This book came out in the 1970's, and the author has added additional methods for picking winners, but it still makes an interesting read."
2,Too much and not enough,"I wish that I could begin to understand the depths of racing that Mr. Beyers does. But alas I am stuck with 30 plus years of experience. I am sure that there is good information in this book. But for anyone that knows the depths of this game, knows it is all numbers and chance that get you. There is value in speed figures, but not much. I wish anyone luck in this game but this book is way too complicated and complex to have any real value to the average gambler.I Wish it were not true."
5,Great basic book for those intent on playing the horses,"Liked the book, covered everything I expected and then some. Would recommend it for those looking to get into betting on the ponies."
4,If you read no other horse racing book this year...,"Quality journalism, genuine passion and beneficial insight in the same book on gambling? Beyer is not only the preeminent thoroughbred handicapper in the world, but he's also an accomplished sports journalist. He wraps everything perfectly in his primer ""Picking Winners."" The book reads like a documentary (you feel his pain!) but teaches like Mister Miyagi (weight on, weight off). Anyone with a remote interest in horse racing betting will enjoy the experience, absorbing Beyer's sage advice all the while. While a beginner won't become a black belt handicapper overnight (like Danny), a new world of awareness will open. And actually that's the essence of this book -- no shortcuts, no easy answers. Become aware of the influences and gain proficiency in interpreting them. ""Picking Winners"" succeeds on many levels but primarily on where so many books of its genre fail. You can read it. Jax Berry"
2,Be prepared :(,"This book is from the 1970's. All the racing charts and related handicapping info/discussions are 35 years old. Meaningless with what's available to todays handicappers. There is some info on handicapping like class and condition. He writes about handicappers using a slide rule. There is nothing about trifectas and superfectas. Nothing written about pick 3's or pick 6's. However, I believe that in the 1970's this book would have rated ""10 Stars"". Today it should be considered a classic read, not a current handicapping book to help pick winners."
3,Picking Winners; A Horseplayer's Guide,This book actually goes above my head in handicapping procedures and so forth. If you are a seasoned handicapper then maybe it might fit your needs better than it met mine.
3,POSSIBLY A GOOD ADJUNCT BOOK....,"In general, I think this book might be helpful to give to older kid in preparation to a Trip to Disney. But, and it's a big but, I think most of the material is a re-hash of material available in Birnbaum's regular Disney book. I think that a trip to disney is expensive enough without thinking you NEED , yet, another ""official"" book. Birnbaum books are the official dinsey books and as such really spout the Disney propaganda. It is somewhat hard to feel that I got a balanced view of disney from these books, so I always buy ""the unnoficial guide"" as well. This year I decided to buy this book for my son... for some pre-disney excitement and to read on the plane. But I really think that this would be the only reason to buy it. The information is available in other books and this is a book that could really be skipped."
5,Great Brazilian Guitarist,"Baden Powell performs some beautiful pieces in this collection of ""waltzes"". It's a wonderful treat to hear Powell's touch on these sensitive compositions. I feel fortunate indeed to have obtained a copy of this CD. Some, if not all, of these pieces are on other CDs, but it is nice to have them collected on one CD. It's nice to appreciate fast, agile, playing, but it is also great to hear slower pieces interjected with strong emotion and thought. Baden Powell...another, truly, great guitarist. ""River of Waltzes"", don't miss the journey."
2,Amazing documentary,"One of the antecedents of Reality Television. Shot by the BBC as they accompanied the British climbing expedition into Nepal and up the mountain. The music sucks by today's standards, as does most of the narration, but it's what worked in the period. But the photography and the ordeal: amazing."
5,Work of Art,"A great one to choose from his past recordings. Prefer it over Dustbowl one only because I like the more bluesy choices included on this on like ""Down by the River"" and ""Just Around the Bend"". He really can sing the blues--great vocals. Someday would love to see some of those songs appear again on a new CD with his vocals enhanced--if you could imagine--with another singer (a.k.a. Bonnie Raitt, etc.). Love the Joe Man as he and his music inspires us all! A true giver to the arts and young musicians."
5,Joe Bonamassa - No Need To Cry Over This One,"Joe's 4th album is another killer blues rock disc. There is more rock than blues to be found on this one, which puts some of Joe's fans off a bit, but this is more really great stuff. Joe seems to incorporate more acoustic and slide elements on this one, and there is even a rockabilly almost country influence to be found as well. Some of these tracks remind me of Swedish guitar phenom Mads Erikson in style. I don't really have a lot more to say about this one other than it is another rock solid album from an incredibly talented guy."
4,Joe performs again,"Joe Bonamassa caught my eye at a Peter Frampton concert. What a fine live performance. Bought 2 cd's in the lobby of ""The Historic""Ryman auditorium in Nashville, Tn.Blown away by his talent both asa guitarist and writer. I know they brought in some outside help in the writing of ""Had to cry Today"", But I don't think Joe needs any help. He does just fine on his own. Therefore I say this album is slightly over-managed.Keep on keepin' on Joe and don't fall off the edge."
4,Very Good!,"This was my first time hearing Bonamassa, very good blues rock, you won't be disappointed with this CD."
2,"""JUMPING JOE"" WAS MEANT TO SING THE BLUES! NOT THIS!","If you're looking for some of ""Jumping Joe's"" classic blues (See Rick ""Shaq"" Goldstein's previous FIVE STAR review of ""BLUES DELUXE""!) this is not the CD for you. If you want middle of the road rock guitar, and not the full ""smoldering, cauldron, of thunder and lightning, guttural, volcanic, power, vocals, that ""Jumping Joe"", is capable of, this is for you. For a true ""Jumping Joe"" blues fan, the only thing this CD will do for you, is complete, your collection of his music, and you won't wonder if you missed something. In closing, a personal note to ""Jumping Joe: ""please record more classic electric blues! When you put out something like ""Blues Deluxe"" you are truly the greatest living electric blues man under 70 years old! This CD is beneath you and your loyal blues, ""street gang!"""
5,Joe is the man.,"I hung out with joe recently in his tour bus and honestly before i met him didnt like him. the fact is he has the chops (ive seen him live) and he is one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet. His band is one of the tightest ive ever seen, and he is in a class of guitar players that only the best will ever reach. I will support anything he does because of how great a guy he was. great guy, great player.this album is great but you have to see him live in order to appreciate how good this kid is.I truly believe he is the next big thing for blues."
1,Not a Blues CD,"If you are looking for blues, this is not it. Buy ""Blues Deluxe"" instead for explosive guitar licks while staying true to modern blues. This CD is a rock CD with no more than two cuts approaching the blues. And the rock? Uninteresting. Nothing new or exciting. A very disappointing purchase on my part."
5,the best,"i am a big reading fan, and this is one of the best reads ever. i love this book so much. you laugh, you cry, and it has a totally awesome story. too bad its not a series"
5,Really easy to relate to!!!,"I think this book was really good and really easy to relate to. Sidonie was a really brave and independent teenage. The stress and problems she dealt with is really common in teen years. It was a happy yet sad story at the same time. It really shows that when you're feeling bad, family is always something you could count on. It was a wonderfully moving story, it showed that you shouldn't blame yourself for someone's actions. I liked the way it described everything in a way that I could understand it but without TOO much details. I think it was a great book and I could probably relate to it later on in life."
5,Great book!,This book was wonderful! The emotions in it seemed to make me feel like I was there as well. It was so well written. I felt like it was real.
4,Not bad but not fantastic either,"I will be visiting Copan at the end of the month so i picked up this book to get some information about the place.Overall the book is really good with lots of pictures which deifinetly is a plus with me.The explanations are very good altough i found myself re-reading some of them often because the author uses a lot of technical terms.The book is to big so i will not carry it with me when i visit Copan.It would have been a plus if the book would have been smaller.One thing that i didnt like was the fact that the author spends too many pages explaining Copan's relationship with other cities in the area.I would have loved to read more about the people of Copan, their daily lives and their beliefs.But again, good introduction."
2,Disappointing,"The DVD was more a review to me than it was a behind the scenes. I wasn't really thrilled with it, though it did allow 'adult' language."
1,"Very, Very, Very Bad!!!!!","Okay Tough Enough did start out great. It showed the in's and out's of the business. During the first and second season. But, when the third season aired. It was appauling!!!!! Just flat out horrible!!!! I don't know what was worst, Big and Al Snow acting in a unprofessional manner or the fact during the third season. They managed to cause problems for actor Kelsey Grammer. Who was living in the area at the time. I thought, the whole thing was suppose to get more people interested. Not drive them away. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Right Light,Not sure if it is OEM but does look good and fits. I would buy again. The price is also right.
4,I like this knife,"I purchased this knife because I have been wanting a Santoku. I read a lot of reviews, looked at a lot of prices and researched for several weeks. I decided on this knife because of the name, reputation and price. I used it immediately and loved it. I can slice paper thin pieces of onions and other veggies. I think it will become an integral part of my kitchen, along with my Hinckels Pro Set."
4,Santoku 7 inch knife,"Bought this along with the smaller santoku knife for heavy duty use. It works just fine for sliding onions and peppers to make fried peppers for garnish. Work went much faster and easier than I expected. Finished much more quickly than I expected in far less time. Went through the onions like butter, was very pleased."
3,Good knife,"Knife looks fine, but I haven[t used because I bought it for someone else.. There was no ""hanging gift box"", however. It came in an ordinary plastic bubble package."
1,Not worth the time to listen to,"The entire CD is nothing but fairly lame covers of hits with no original artists on it. The mixes aren't particualarly good nor or the vocals. It is a very amaturish effort and I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the music. If you like remixes, I would suggest purchasing remixes of original recordings."
3,Not as Good as It Seems!,"My daughter was so excited to receive this toy for Christmas. Needless to say, being only the age of 4, it was very hard for her to play with. The directions were to complicated for her to understand and it is very messy! We have played with it twice and it is still in the box in the corner of her room. Not as good as it sounds."
2,A Real Disappointment,"This set makes a mess. There's really no way my 4 year old daughter could handle this by herself. She was dissapointed quickly. There's a limited amount of mix, but we have some still, because she lost interest when she saw she couldn't do it by herself. She has much more fun helping me make cookies and then playing with her Barbie while the cookies bake."
4,Great Dolls but ewe on the mess,I have to say cute dolls but the stuff they give you to make the cakes was worse than old cake batter my kids couldn't get to the sink fast enough to spit it out. I love Barbie and so do my kids but they should of put more thought into the baking stuff. Thankgoodness it only comes with a little plus the sprinkles were messy. I love the dolls but I would rather have my kids pretend she makes food than actually do it.
4,Barbie & kelly Fun Treats,The toy is fun but we are having a problem finding refills for the mix. If we could find refills the toy would be excellent.
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this set. It is very messy and once you are done, there are no more refills to make more cakes. My daughter liked eating the frosting and the sprinkles, but after she was done, she had no interest in the toy."
2,"Good idea, but....","My daughter received this Barbie as a gift. Good idea but not worth the money, in my opinion. When we were mixing up the cake mix it had a horrible smell to it. My daughter plugged her nose and left the room. Not a good choice if you have a weak stomach. Do not waste your money, good thought and idea."
1,Glad it was on sale,"I glad I bought this on sale! My five year daughter and I tried ""baking"" and all it turned out to be was a huge mess! The icing wouldn't come out of the pots and the sugar crystal were falling out the second pot before we even finished filling the pan at the first station. The taste was terrible! All that trouble and my daughter couldn't even eat it! The only thing my daughter uses now are the dolls."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"I didn't realize until we opened the box how messy this toy was. The icing mix smells awful and was a mess to clean up. I'm glad the mix is gone and I told my daughter she could pretend to make cakes in the oven. I would not buy any more mix even if it was available. The dolls are cute, but leave the mix out of the package, waste of money."
1,Just frickin' lame,"You can't jump, you fellow marines' AI is annoying as hell:""I can't reach the destination.""""I can't reach the destination.""""I can't reach the destination.""Why? Because-- oh my God-- there's a stray beer can in the way that they can't jump over. The movement is slow, the graphics play is loser-like, and the enemy is ridiculous. You don't get a backup weapon like a pistol or anything. This game is a total waste of $35. DON'T buy it."
5,cover my back!!!,"My dad pre-ordered this game I think this is going to be a fun game if your looking for afour player mutiplayer missions ,and go into a fire arenacall in more marines cobra gunship and more!!!lead your squad to victory!"
1,Close Combat,Here is the formula:Full Spectrum Warrior - everything good + a slow 1st person shooter with blocky movements = Close Combat: First to Fight
2,poop,I am 0352 US MArine and this game in no way represents reality by any means. every review that i have seen to date show me that this game SUCKS!!!!
5,Semper Fi--Devil Dogs,"Having spent a few years in the Corps and been involved in conflicts such as this ( served during the first Gulf War ), I advise anyone who like FPSG to get this one. I was hooked for sometimes up to 4 hours playing it.It brought back good and bad memories about what I had been through. Any of the previous geekoids who hated this game have spent too much time thinking other games resemble real-life. I say get out and experience life before passing judgement. This game was awesome in it's intensity, graphics and gameplay. Well worth the money. I am hoping for a sequel because I will be the first one in line."
3,There are much better games,"I really couldn't finish the game since it's so under the standards of the best current xbox games available, for instantce: any Ghost Recon game is far more realistic and fun than First to Fight. The graphics are so-so, but if you don't feel they're important to the enjoyment of a game, then you'll be ok. The control and movements of your character are not what one would expect from a war game, specially if they say is ""as reallistic as it gets"", first because you can't peek from corners, you can't get down all the way to the floor, and if my memory doesn't fail me, you can't jump. So, what kind of realism is this? Anyway, if you don't mind all the cons, you may find the game fun."
2,Great Bedtime Gothic,"If you need help sleeping, this is the book to buy. I hoped it would get better, it did not. I like a book that I can't put down,this one was easy to ""put down"" parden the pun."
3,TRYING FOR FIRST TIME,Can't say I've noticed much of a difference yet. Giving it more time and trying to mix with other things.
1,never recieved book,"Since I never recieved the book my review of it is not pleasant. Ordered back in August and still waiting, finally for my class I ordered it on my kindle. I wanted the book because sometimes it is easier to sift through for my test questions for my class."
1,Big Waste!,"Having trained in the martial arts for over 12 years now, as well as being familiar with Steve DeMasco, I should have known better than to waste money on one of his products. I have been suckered before by him and this will be the last time. I gained nothing out of the nonsense in this book."
3,A response,"In response to your review of REDRUM. I can tell you that my mother and I are doing fairly well. But the damage done by a botched Durham investigation has taken it's toll on me....I become increasingly frustrated day by day. It has been 15 years and the person who has killed my sister has not been found. This makes me fearfull as I too have a small child now, and I know the horrors that this person inflicted upon my sister.And the scariest part is that person still lives among us.Since you wondered in your review how my family was doing. I thought I would tell you.Sincerely Ken Jessop"
1,Writing one's belief doesn't make it Truth... Truth and fear are mutually exclusive.,"Could have been said in 20 pages or less. Forced erudition. Fraught with the vibration of ego. Subtle fear-mongering generously dispersed throughout. To use an expression from the book, it's ""tainted"" -- big time."
4,Does what its supposed to.,"It's decent, does what it's supposed to do and no fuss about it. Not much else to say, I'd buy more of these as I needed them, they are good quality. I do like the small plastic protective case it comes in, thats very handy for keeping it in your toolbox and undamaged."
5,Rosle Ladle,Bought this based on review on either Cooks Country or Americas Test Kitchen. Very pleased. Great piece of equipment. Would buy again.
3,"Good ladle, but....","This ladle does work well, but I have a minor beef with the hooked end. The hooked end is swell, I suppose, if you have a utensil rack. But if you keep your kitchen tools in crock or similar container, the hooked end always snags the other tools, causing them to dump out when all you wanted was the ladle! Again, not a big deal, but sufficiently annoying that I would not buy one again."
4,Solid drama about family and spiritual turmoil,"What makes this movie work is that the character who receives the strongest ""preaching to"" is a clergy-candidate. Many viewers are put off when the super-righteous spiritual persons speaks down to the ignorant sinner. The hero, Jeremiah, is torn with guilt over an incident that took place when he was 14. His twin brother was under attack and he froze. The guilt has scarred his life ever since. Mercy Street's primary story is Jeremiah's journey through this guilt to true reconciliation with the episode, with his brother, and with God.The frame for the story involves a criminal counterfeiting scam. Even the unsavory Rome, the chief ""counterfeiter,"" gets to preach at Jeremiah. The plot does offer suspense on this level, but also much light-hearted humor.Bottom-line: This is a solid drama that should lead to interesting discussion. It garners four-stars as an excellent film, with a strong ""Made For TV"" feel."
5,This DVD has extra features!,"This DVD has 12 deleted scenes on it as well as the theatrical trailer, director (Jon Gunn) and star (David White) commentary and a 43-minute documentary entitled ""The Making of Mercy Streets."" For fans of the film, there's plenty to enjoy here!"
2,David White,"David White plays a street character(s), which threw me off during the whole movie. I couldn't get into this, preferring a more Christian theme. The language wasn't raw, guess that makes it a family film. I cannot show mercy for this street movie -- too far of a stretch from anything that could occur in reality. Maybe I didn't understand the message; I'll try watching it again, just for the sake of David White. (smile)"
2,"Poorly done movie, not particularly Christian.","We heard this was a Christian movie, and were sorely disappointed after viewing it. First, the Gospel was never clearly presented. The church represented was the Episcopal Church, which is a mainline denomination where few claim to be ""born-again."" Secondly, the plot is confusing and silly, with the main character playing two roles (identical twin brothers) who essential change places. However, the good one is supposed to be a pastor, and yet he is willing to commit a crime for his criminal brother, and he also cannot seem to understand salvation, as he ends up in another church being preached at by Stacy Keach (actor playing a priest). The story is a non-sensical mess. Save your money."
3,I Gave It 3 Stars.,"It's definitely worth a one time watch I guess, and a share with others close to you who are struggling in their faith. HOWEVER, I am so tired of seeing David White star in like EVERY CHRISTIAN MOVIE OUT THERE. It looks like the mainstream Christian industry is struggling for actors, terribly. Goes to show how NARROW THE GATE IS, I reckon. I guess you'll enjoy this one otherwise. I liked the movie personally, don't get me wrong .. but Dear Christian Movie Industry, .. HIRE NEW ACTORS. When you've seen these people in like 50 other Christian films, it's just not so impacting as far as the Power Punch Delivery goes. Same with "" Facing The Giants "". Loved it ! Then I went on to watch "" Courageous "" , and again realized that there is a call for more Christian actors. Only proves that people need to get saved out there, and get involved in the Christian movie media. I for one, am personally getting bored."
3,"Was an OK movie, nothing to write home about.","Even though there are some notable actors in this, like Eric Roberts, this movie lacks a strong story line. I would rather has spent the money on another movie. Disappointing and somewhat lame."
2,"Well, at least its not End Times junk!","Acting is ok. The plot is a little generic with the twin brothers, one a priest and the other a two bit thug. Lawrence Taylor and Stacy Keach's roles are completely pointless. For instance, Keach has about a paragraph or two of lines as does Taylor. They are EXTREMELY minor roles, though the trailer would have you think otherwise. I think the producers got them in the film to just have a selling point of two big names.I'd say this is a step up for Christian films in that its not End Times and it tries to deal with real life though the ending is still happy but too sun shiney and flowery. Theres a good amount of Christian content in the film. Not too preachy but its not the most solid film, theologically or movie wise. Some violence and references to violence. Parents should probably view it first before showing it to kids under 13.Worth a rent."
3,Not that good,This movie was okay - not good enough to recommend to anyone. The plot and the acting were somewhat superficial.
1,Where's the logic ?,This is a poorly constructed thesis and serves only to display the typical weak minded headonism of carnivores. Perhaps a person so simple could only serve one cause. I would also recommend ignoring the false information provided regarding health issues of veganism.
2,Somewhat misleading.,"I bought this CD because another CD of Gene McDaniels I recenty acquired did not have the original version of ""A Tear"" on it. That CD had a remake of the song with a slighty different beat and surprisingly different lyrics at the end of the song. (I have a scratched up 45 rpm of the song so I know what it should sound like.)The advertisement for this CD read ""All tracks are digitally remastered from the original master tapes."" This could be but the track for ""A Tear"" is not the original recording from the 60's. It's the same as the other CD I have where all the tracks on it are remakes."
2,More padding per pound than any book I've ever found,"I'm sorry, but this book is a big disappointment. There are some pretty good suggestions (read the newspaper, practice your jokes, etc.) but you have to wade through thousands of words to find them. And the stories! I felt like I was being dragged kicking and screaming through story after story -- most boring. There is enough solid information here to make a good ten page magazine article. The rest is fluff -- filler. Granted, it's easy to read. It just doesn't say anything. Save your money and buy ""How to work a room"" by the same author. It has just about everything in this book and a lot of other stuff that's better. And it's not nearly so padded."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I listened to this audio tape and it was awful. I felt her suggestions were not practical (keep a notebook of funny things that happen during the day and then use those stories at a party) and her examples of conversations were very self-serving and not anything I would strive to attain. She bashed the advice of asking questions to keep a conversation rolling, and I find this to be a great tool. If you are dying to find what this is all about, go to your local library. Otherwise, don't bother."
2,Not a keeper,"I bought the audio-tape read by the author. I hope she is a better speaker than a books-on-tape reader. I found her delivery nasal and flat. It was unpleasant listening to her.The content was thin, included too many quotes, and came off at times as self-congratulatory. If I didn't think conversation skills were important I wouldn't have bought the tape. I didn't need to hear over and over how important being a ""conversensation"" (her much over-used term) is to social and business success.I listened to this tape twice (the second time to verify my impressions) and then got rid of it. It was a waste of money.I found a much better tape on the subject in ""The Fine Art of Small Talk"" by Debra Fine."
3,Nice book.,"Being it my first reading on the subject, I found it interesting. It is not a reference book, so it is not organized sistematically; sometimes it's a bit boring too. Anyway, it's an easy reading, there're a lot of useful ""how to"" and it suggests the ""right conversationalist's point of view and habits""."
1,Very basic and a lot of filler.,"This tape was a major disappointment to me. Not only were there very few tips, and unfortunately nothing new, but the author kept harping on them over and over in story after story. If these basic ideas helped some listeners, then great. But many of us have already learned and applied these lessons. The better objective is to be able to enjoy the event not just live through it!"
4,A confidence booster!!!,"This book covers the most basic elements of successful conversing; for example, what EXACTLY to do when walking into a room full of people. Offers good questions, comments, etc. to use when in various situations. And presents ideas on how to make others good conver""sensational""ists. I have yet to practice these skills (and there are quite alot outlined), but, am I excited about trying them out! Also, includes a chapter on ""net-iquette""."
2,"Good General Overview, Bad Specifics","This tape tells what a good talker is, but it only has a very few specifics and even fewer examples. It almost seems like an introduction to another tape."
5,Susan really knows what she's talking about.,I am basically shy. She's shown me that I can live with it and work through it. I got some techinques to break into conversation at social and work gatherings.
2,Very simplistic,"I found the book to be very simplistic. There seem to be a lot of words, without much being said. Her main advice seems to be, prepare a list of stories to tell in advance, and learn to speak about the weather.Most of the tips she has are just plain common sense. I guess, if you are having major problems conversing with people, (people leave when you enter a conversation, or the conversation dies when you speak) then you might get this book to find out some of her don'ts.I expected her tips to include more examples of conversations. Overall, I would look for a different book on the subject."
2,Rehash of previous book,"This is a skinnied-down rehash of Astral Projection cowritten with Melita Denning over a decade ago. Denning was the more educated, more experienced and better magician and writer of the two, and boy can you tell! It's a flimsy book, hardly worth the price if one has any prior experience, but better than nothing for the rank beginner. I'm very surprised it's even been published"
1,Really bad book...,"I believe this was one of the first few books I purchased and read on the subject of Astral Projection. Suffice to say it's anything BUT plain and simple... it's confusing and convoluted.Why? Because he puts so much stock in regurgitating the mystical, old world traditions and pseudo knowledge regarding astral projection... and attempts to label every little experience with his own (and mystical traditions) subjective truths that it not only didn't help me, it actually contributed to getting even more confused about the subject and kept me from projecting. It took me over ten years before I had my first conscious projection... and this book contributed to that length of time.This isn't a book for beginners. It's a book for nobody. It will do nothing but further confuse and frustrate you as to what Astral Projection is and how to do it.I wish I could get my money back for it now, but I had bought it many years ago from elsewhere."
1,Not Plain and Simple,"Spent a few hours reading this. Like another person said, I'm surprised it is even published. The author's writing style is annoying; his sentences and words are put together in a confusing way. His writing does not flow very nicely like other works by Monroe or Peterson. I've read several other books and this one is by far the worst. The author adds a lot of magical nonsense, perhaps from his other books on majic, and, well, nonsense. My advice, don't even bother. If you can't do his weird exercises, like see astral substance and even turn it into a ball, then you can't do other exercises that build on it. And where does he come up with ridiculous exercises like ""the watcher,"" and the astral substance ones. I've never read these anywhere else. Every time i managed to overlook his poor writing, I found myself wanting to skip his crass exercises."
4,Teknik yang bagus bagi praktisi metafisik,"Penulis buku ini adalah anggota sekte magis Aurum Solis, bersama dengan Melita Denning telah menulis beberapa buku metafisik. Sebelum menguraikan teknik untuk proyeksi astral / raga sukma / ngraga sukma, penulis menyiapkan beberapa latihan : menyiapkan tempat latihan, teknik dasar, bola astral, menciptakan pengamat astral dan mengirimkan pesan yang bermanfaat. Semuanya melatih kemampuan astral anda sebelum berproyeksi astral. Ada 4 teknik proyeksi dalam buku ini. Sebagai tambahan, anda juga akan dapat menyembuhkan dengan teknik astral, mewujudkan impian jadi kenyataan, bahkan astral seks pun dapat anda lakukan."
2,Not Appropriate for Young Children,"I purchased this book thinking it would be good for the children to learn more about God's laws. Unfortunately, the book goes into too much unneeded detail (where little ones are concerned) regarding certain matters such as sins of the flesh. For example, to ""look at bad pictures, or touch yourself or anyone else in an impure way..."" introduces subjects which are inappropriate for such young minds. Furthermore, the suggestion that children should busy themselves in ""work or play"" when bad thoughts arise is not the Catholic. This book disappointingly ignores the importance of prayer in overcoming temptation - especially temptations of the flesh.We have an obligation to educate children in the Catholic faith. This book is not the answer. That said, I do not recommend this book."
3,there is some problem with the basis,"the basis of this product, doesn't match with the slot of the camera, it is rounded and the camera's slot is blocked. my video camera model is dcrhac/42; so I have make it to match, because if I sent it back will be more cost. for me. But it works with the camera and takes beatyful photos."
3,Surprisingly Good Lewis Effort,"Originally titled ""Smorgasbord,"" this 1983 Jerry Lewis comedy never received an American theatrical release yet remains among his better efforts. The film is little more than a collection of sketches involving a suicidal misfit named Warren Nefron. Some routines are priceless (notably the pantomimic tour de force in a psychiatrist's office) while others misfire. Nevertheless, it's nice to see writer-director Lewis in relatively good form after the astonishing sloppiness of ""Hardly Working"" (1981)."
5,vhs,Got this for my sis who loves old jerry lewis movies. she loves it and is very glad I got it for her. good quality and fast delivery.
4,Nothing like an old classic!,My husband has been talking about seeing this movie for months. After discovering that we couldn't rent it anymore I decided to purchase it. I'm very satisfied with the used copy I purchased. The seller sent it quickly and it arrived in great condition. I highly recommend purchasing from this seller and if my husband is looking for another old Jerry Lewis movie I'll be shopping again!
2,Not made to play in all DVD players . . .,"I was really looking forward to finally getting this movie in DVD format (great movie). I was pretty disappointed when I received this DVD and found that the Warner Archive DVD's are very finicky about where they will load. It doesn't work in my main DVD player which is only a couple of years old. I have a small 9-inch DVD player that it will play in, but if you have a DVD player that records, forget about the Warner Archive DVDs, so now I have to watch this movie on a tiny portable player. Every other DVD I've ever purchased before works fine except for this one. For the price of this DVD, it should have been recorded like most all other DVDs."
3,Mixed,"As far as the Movie itself, I liked it and thought there were a few VERY funny scenes. My only complaint is with the DVD itself. It won't play on my best equipment because it's a player AND recorder. It says right on the back of the case that it won't play on machines that also have recording capability. That's a first for me. Very aggravating."
5,Since when I was 3,"The review who said this was a cult classic for his family must be in my family. Some key details of his writing tell me he isn't. But god is this movie good. When I was 3, my brother taped this off HBO, and we watched it every day. 3 times a day. I am not kidding. My family went nuts. They loved the movie, but cmon, 3 times a day, isn't that excessive? Yes. It was.But this movie is hysterical. And the caveat is, people will either love it or hate it, and you'll never be able to predict who will fall into which camp."
1,"You folks are kidding, right?","This movie was as awful as anything Lewis has done since the mid-60s (though a few have been worse). The opening title sequence, in the psychiatrist's office, is very funny, true, but unfortunately the movie continues after that. Part of the story takes place in France, an obvious bone thrown to the country where some critics take Lewis seriously."
4,Good not great,"Ladder is extremely heavy and awkward to move and height is closer to 18 feet after adjusting for tilt and standin height. Has a preset standing angle of 45* so it cannot really get close to walls unless you close one side. Good points are very stable, no swaying at full extension, multiple heights. Can be used inside as well as out."
5,GREAT FOR KIDS 5 TO 9,My daughter is 5 she loves this doll. The doll is very durable but the pocketbook rack is not and is easly lost and of course so are the pocketbook's. The dress display is not very durable easly cracked. Great for any kid who takes care of there toys...
1,Droped the ball,"I am unhappy with the fact that I never recived my order I purchesed it on June 6th then was informed that it would not be delivered untill June 12 to the 29 on July 4th, I had to ask for my money back I will never order from Amazon again it has been a bad exsperance that I do not wish to go through again it seems they dont have any control over ther vendors.Jack lee"
1,Not very impressive,Not a powerful flash.No significant difference between the on-board flash and this one.
4,Question,"Does this flash work with a Sony DSC S85 camera?I believe so, but there is almost no information regarding thison the web."
1,Worse Than A Flashlight,I bought this for a Sony DSC-F717 and it is atrocious at best.(I would still like to find a GOOD and ADEQUATE video light)I returned it as it was really no better than the flash unit that comes on the camera but it added weight up high.
3,Clips break to quickly,The leather casing stretched too quickly and the clip broke very fast.I guess I'm gladd I bought 2.
4,How to help avoid job burn out.,"This video follows people who know about high stress jobs,nurses and doctors in the ER. Their stories spoke to me and told me how they handle their stresses. I have applied some of their techniques in my job. I found it very helpful."
3,melissa and doug dress up puzzles,Was a little disappointed that only the tops and bottems were interchangeable. Very durable though. Kept my daughter occupied for a while but after she mastered all the poutfits they went away into a storage bin.
3,Adequate,"I've had this air conditioner for three years and it does a good job of cooling the bedroom. However, it is louder than I would like. Also, while it is indeed portable, it's not quite as easy to move as one might think. Not having to empty water it is a plus."
2,Have to change golf grips to utilize fully,"This book was very inexpensive and some of the principles described can be useful even if you don't adopt the core of the Natural Golf philosophy and swing mechanics. However, to try out the core techniques described, it is best if you replace your golf clubs' grips with Natural Golf grips. Personally, I'm not willing to go to that expense just to try out a new golf swing.I wonder whether the inventors / proponents of the Natural Golf swing were successful selling books cheap and getting consumers to buy their golf grips - like selling razors cheap and socking it to consumers on the cost of blades. If so, more power to 'em - pretty clever."
2,Not noticeable effects from it...,"Well, hard to tell it does not work, it is just that I have not notice any effect from it, and I am 64 y.o., could be that my hormone level is just fine while on some herbal supps. And Paleo eating / living for + 2 years now, anyway I guess sublinguals are effective. Lmb"
4,Very cute!,"My daughter got this for her birthday, she loves that it talks and she was laughing because it makes a kissing sound. She has the whole set of Rapunzel toys and she loves them..."
2,Subtly Urges Your Little Princess to Marry Well,"A fundamental tenet of good parenting is that one should ease one's children into life's deeper lessons at an early age. Some of our best tools for doing this come from fairy tales and their morals, others from the raw materials of play. To this arsenal the wizards at Mattel add a vital weapon in the form of Ken Doll Prince Stefan. A single glance tells it all - the fine Italian clothes, the solid gold accoutrements, the he-tiara - Ken Doll Prince Stefan is loaded. An hour or so of play with Ken Doll Prince Stefan provided the perfect segue to revealing the broad outlines of our fading financial circumstances to our young daughter, and to explaining how finding herself a real Prince Stefan might one day help her transcend this situation."
1,bad product!!!!!,"I have to go through the hassle of returning this Paper Punch as it does not work at all. I can't even feed one page at a time into it without a struggle, and even then the 7 punches are not aligned even enough to punch the holes, - the paper gets stuck and I have to tear it out. on the 3 of them, it doesn't even cut through the paper, alignment is absolutely messed up!!! waisted time, paper, money, and bunch of nerves on this one..."
5,The Next Place,This is a wonderful book that helps to put death in an explainable manner. It was read aloud at a family member's funeral. I plan to give it to everyone I know when the time comes.
5,Perfect!,"I purchased this book for my bookshelf after it was read at a childs funeral I atttended. Very nice quality,meaningful book."
5,Excellent gift for the bereaved,"This book continues to be my standard gift to anyone who has lost a loved one. I gave it to my children this year for Christmas in memory of their father who passed away this spring. I taped a childhood picture of them and their dad to the inside to make it personal. Recently a very good friend's 22 year old daughter died suddenly in a freak accident. I gave it to her mother to read the to all the current and future grand children to try to explain the loss and the idea that what is next is so good. It doesn't really fill the void of the lost one, but helps to see the beautiful place they may be in and know that it is good."
5,The Next Place,"I have purchased atleast 20 copies of this book to give to friends or family who have recently lost a loved one. The beautiful illustrations of several of the ""next places"" are comforting to those grieving. This is children's book,but is very helpful to adults who are grieving the lost of a loved one. There is no referance to God or religion, only beautiful pictures of the sky and places where there is no pain, but only the love which had been given. It is very comforting. When my brother died I gave a copy to each of his adult children, so they could share it with their families.This is an outstanding book!!! I always keep some on hand.DJC"
5,The Next Place,"I purchased this book to read to my mother when she was in a coma, the night before she traveled to the next place. I used to talk to her about life after death, and lovinly reminded her before I left her room to be sure to come back and let me know that I was right and she wasn't .... she leaves me dimes. I then read it to my family later that evening. I have given it to several of my friends - a psychologist, a nurse, a mom, and they all found it very loving and helpful. I don't think its ""new agey"" whatever that is supposed to mean. I certainly believe in God and that ""new age"" terminology is so biased."
5,One Of the Most Beautiful and Moving Books I Have Ever Read!,"This is a touching book for people of all ages. I came across it today at a school supply store. I was attracted to it first by the title and then drawn in by the art on the cover. Needless to say, after picking up the book and reading it I could not leave it in the store. I was so taken by this short read that it brought me to tears. It is a book I will be reading to my children and hopefully their children and so on, long after I make my journey into the next place."
5,Simple but true,"This story gives our imagination a place to go during the time of grief. The author lets us find a space where we can imagine our loved one. The drawings are amazing, the words simple but true."
1,Pass on this book,"People rave about the pictures in this book but honestly, they are nothing special and the wording is not all that great either."
1,"What a bleak, sad little book","I read this only out of curiosity. As a Christian, I have a much different knowledge of what happens after death. But even if I didn't have my beliefs, I'd still find this a discouraging book. The message seems to be that after we die, we just sort of drift off to somewhere, someplace, some kind of undefined existence -- like a balloon that's been released. Will there be joy? Others? Experiences? Growth? Who knows -- the author doesn't seem to.There are better answers than the abiguity that this book promotes. If you start with Jesus, you can't go wrong. With this book, you'll only become depressingly lost. There are plenty of children's books about death that are written from a Christian perspective, books that are vastly more reassuring and encouraging than this. They're based on truth, not on wishful thinking."
2,Not quite what I was looking for.,"I have been buying books for meself and my two boys for a loss of someone very dear to us. I have found some to be comforting, but unfortunately this was not one of them. It does have some intersting pictures? Kind of artsy. But, just not what I was looking for, and my kids didn't seem to like this one very much...."
3,Great comfort to my child,"My father died recently and our minister recommended this book for my four year old son who has a lot of questions about his grandfather's death. My son loves it. I like it, too."
1,Not worth the money,"Although this was not an expensive book, it still was not worth the money--unless your child is between 2 and 6 years old."
1,The Next Place,This book is an excellent book to help explain death to a child or an adult. It has beautiful pictures that are as comforting as the words. I have given this book to many friends who have lost a family member. I received the book myself after losing my son and I found the words and images very comforting.
1,Luke 16:19-31,"Just please read God's word, Luke 16:19-31 and then The Next Place. Then put your trust in, and find your comfort from God or man."
5,Grieving books,"I loved this book. This one I keep for me, but I immediately ordered another to give as a gift to someone I love, who suffered a great loss of her unborn 8 month baby."
5,Beautiful and emotional,"Having had my parents, my wife and (today) my sister pass on to a very much better place, I can promise that this is an exquisite book that has helped me over and over. But you will cry each time that you read it. God bless the author for his work - it is so comforting."
5,Absolutely beautiful...,"A family member gave my then nine-year old sister this book about five years ago when my father died very suddenly (at the age of fifty-one and with no apparent medical problems) on my birthday. At the time I myself had just turned twenty-three and upon reading the book, it helped me cry all of the tears held back by shock. When I moved in with my husband about a year later, I purchased the book for myself, just to have it on the shelf. To this day, I still pick it up and flip through it. I don't really cry, but I oddly feel very warm and closer to my dad."
4,Give a wonder pictures of life... in a simple way..,"It is wonderful for children of all ages...A wonderful trip to the ""other place"" ...with pictures and color.... Kathy"
1,terrible,"Hearing this poem read aloud recently at a memorial service reinforced the opinion I had formed earlier upon reading this picture book that the poetry is trite predictable and banal. I would never read this to a child, and did not find it at all comforting, having just lost my husband, and know he would have agreed. We both love literature and beautiful poetry that stirs the emotions and stimulates the mind and this does neither. I knew long before the reader got there, exactly what the next line would say. Wish I had the book in front of me so I could quote a few lines but luckily I borrowed it from the library and have returned it."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"The Next Place was recommended to me for use with families who have lost a loved one. As a Christian pastor, I would never give or recommend this book to a grieving family. Why? Because it presents an afterlife without God, without heaven or hell, without bodies. It's Gnosticism 101. New Agey. No comfort here for the faithful of God."
2,offends no one--means little,"The reviewer who stated this book is so ecumenical that it can offend no one is probably correct, as long as it's ok with you that it doesn't mean very much at all. I love the pictures and the idea of imagining what heaven would be like, but I hope there's a lot more to heaven than this book suggests. I would be bored stiff in this Next Place."
1,Ambiguous at best...,"This book doesn't seem comforting to me, nor would it comfort any child I know. And I run an early learning center! It's so un-offensive and lacks so much promise. If I were a kid, I wouldn't want to go there. No seasons? What?? Sounds completely unappealing from a child's perspective. It's like saying, ""When you die, you're going to go somewhere where there is nothing but a big bright light and it's really quiet. There will be nothing you've ever known, but maybe some people you don't know."" Weird. If I were five I'd give it two thumbs down and say it sounded pretty boring."
3,"No reference to ""Heaven""","I bought this book with hopes that it will help me to discuss with my children the approaching death of their Grandma. We are a Christian family and I was really hoping this book would directly regard Heaven as the place believers go after we die. There is no such direct releflection, but just ""comforting words"" that there is a better place. There is also no reference to God, nor to Jesus. I am happy that this book has helped others with this sensitive issue, but I have to say I am a bit disapointed."
5,book,"Superb ,inspirational piece for those who have recently suffered a loss or more importantly experiencing the slow process of dying."
5,mobear,A friend gave my daughter this book a few years ago when her grandfather passed away and we love it so much that we passed it onto another friend. He is 6 years old and his mom said he really liked it! Kids that age only grasp so much about death and I feel this book helps them to understand in a very pleasant way.
5,wonderful,"What a lovely little book.When my husband died last August,he was an organ donor.The Carolina Donor Society sent me one and I still read it every day.It really helps when the ""pity party"" starts.Since that time I have sent 4 to friends and they all have felt the same way about it.I now keep an extra(they can't have mine) one on hand.It doesn't offend anyones religious beliefs,but can really soothe a broken heart."
5,The Next Place,"I purchase this book for adults and children alike when they have lost someone close to them. It is such a wonderful explanation about going to the next place and as my 8 year old grandaughter said, ""that's not scary at all!"" It is beautifully written and illustrated and I would recommend it for everyone who is having a hard time dealing with the loss of a loved one and even those who are not. It is so comforting. My sister actually read it at my father's memorial service and it was especially helpful since he died of alzheimers. I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages."
4,The Next Place,"Beautiful pictures with soothing message. It is written for children, but it gave me great comfort when I lost my beloved pet."
5,Awesome service,Amazon continues to amaze me with prices and service second to none. I would rather buy over Amazon than ship anyday! Book came well protected in a box much larger than the books size. Thanks!
5,Help for grief,I bought this book at the urging of a relative who had received one from a perfect stranger. I gave it to a good friend who had recently lost her son. It is simply written and I cried the first time I read it. So simple and clear that even a child could understand it and comforting to adults. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I bought two so I could have one on hand should anyone need it.
5,more for adults or very young children-under 5,"As a grandmother who lost her 13mo old granddaughter this past christmas due to an accident I found it comforting and understood the wording more for an adult. My 8yr old granddaughter wanted me to read it with her,so I did. There were a few things that she seemed dissapointed with and that was not bringing a favorite stuffed friend to the ""next place"" or not being able to see faces of the ones that are left behind. Her perception is that her sister sees her from the ""next place"" and that her sister has her favorite toy with her, comforting her.Other than that, I felt if I passed away I would want my family to read the book and know how I feel in the ""next place"""
5,"Awesome, Comforting",I work in a critical care unit as a nurse. I have given this book to grieving families (young and old). It has helped them deal with their overwhelming loss. The pain of death is so deep. This book helps them feel more in control of their feelings and and gives them GREAT comfort. Kudos to Warren Hanson on having such tremendous insight!!
4,Good book for terminally ill,"I read this book with interest. I liked it but a well person would realize that NOBODY knows what the hereafter is. However, for someone looking at death in the face, it might be of some comfort."
5,A Gift Of Hope!!,"My aunt recently died after an eight month battle with a brain tumor. At the wake, her sister-in-law brought this book to my aunt's two adult daughters. What a gift! It harbors such hope and comfort. I appreciate the manner in which Mr. Hanson explains what we all have to look forward to. I know my aunt is somewhere else right now but also lives in all of our hearts forever."
5,A book which makes it just a little bit less painful,I recently received this book from friends following the sudden death of my 30-year old brother. Reading it brought combined tears of happpiness and sadness. This book was terrific with its wonderful words and vibrant illustrations. It made me feel a little more comfort in knowing that my brother would always be with me until the one day we would meet again. I know I'll always have a beautiful angel looking out for me. Now I'm sending this uplifting book to my bother's best friend - his wife.
1,"Inauthentic, cheesy, confusing","I have recently been through the difficult process of explaining to my three-year-old daughter her grandfather's death. I was given this book by a colleague, but I never read it to her, because it seemed to me inauthentic, cheesy, and confusing.I see this book as a well-meaning, but misguided, effort to distract children from the normal and healthy--and necessary-- process of grieving. It is full of bland bromides that are meant to be comforting, but would actually be confusing and scary to children. I would have felt dishonest and phony reading it to my daughter...at a time when she needed honesty and sincerity. ""Yes, Honey, Grandpa died. No, wait! He went on to ""the Next Place!"" Look how perfect and wonderful it is! Isn't he lucky? Yay! Grandpa's in the next place!""Instead of this book, I recommend ""Remember the Butterflies,"" ""Thank You, Grandpa,"" and ""Lifetimes."""
4,Hmmm...Beautiful book.,"I was looking for the perfect book on death and dying for my ""almost four year old"" grandson, since both of my parents, his great grandparents died within 13 days of each other; one in the south and one in the north. I read Amazon book reviews very carefully, but upon receiving and reading (a few times) I realized it was much to sophisicated for a younger child, even one ""above average"". This was my first book of this type so I can not recommend another at this time."
3,dress up my sammy,"This is pretty good if you like the old Bob's Big Boy restaurant sauce that went on hamburgers. It could use a bit more tang but is still a nice way to dress up your sammy. I use it as a dip for fried cod fingers, the adult version of fish sticks, but I add a little Woeber's Horseradish sauce to make it more zippy. Never write food reviews on an empty stomach, now I'm starving for Cod Fingers. LOL"
2,Intruder List & Applying Updates,When looking at the intruder list you can see that if you use the right slide bar you can display more info (click on the sidebar until End Of List). Noticing this: when looking at the list of Advanced Firewall Srettings you can determine that the Intruder Name only appears when the entire list of Intruders has been loaded (clicking on the slidebar until End Of List). If you remove the Intruder list there is no name displayed next to your trusted/denied list. You do not know who's IP is who's trusted or denied.Applying Updates: the entire trusted/denied list is wiped out and you have to reenter it thing to do Using the update option available withing the Black Ice Defender program: very difficult. making a copy of this list may not work as I noticed a change made within - it so placing Trusted or denied users in the list may be difficult.
1,But you can get the same functionality for free,Go to zonelabs.com and download their personal version firewall. I use it and it does everything people talk about here -- I was thinking changing it out and buying this product until I read these reviews -- plus its easy to use AND IT'S FREE.
1,XP/Norton AnitiVirus Users Beware,"BlackICE Defender is a good product. However, if you're using Windows XP and/or Norton AntiVirus with this product you should expect to have many contacts for support. I would not recommend this combination of software. Using no firewall at all will extend your life!"
2,reasons not to get black ice and save money...,"it slowed my cable service down so much that I am thinking about going back to the good old dial up. It was very hard for me to set up and to keep everyone out as the speeds that I have created took sometime to get to and only one second to slow down. from a 2 meg down load to a 33600 on the rictor scale of slow thats slow.. to tell you all the truth I really wasted $40.00 of hard earned money.. so now when it is not being used it gets turned off and thats it. if you want speed then try something else or just do what I am doing ,,turn the damn thing off.. this red alert thing got everyone so paranoid that they all want to get in side this old beast to see whats up..."
4,Is a firewall really necessary for you?,"In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, news reports about the internet becoming a potential ""terrorist"" target made me concerned that some protection in addition to my anti-virus software might be in order. After some research, I decided that Black Ice Defender would be the preferred product (over Norton and McAfee firewalls). After purchasing and installing it, I no longer believe that users who connect to the internet via a dial-up modem are at any significant risk of having their systems hacked into. In the two weeks since I installed this, most of the probes directed at my connection have been routine ones from my own ISP. If you use a dial-up modem to connect to the internet, RELAX. Save your money or use it to satisfy yourself with some more useful toy."
2,"RUN, HIDE, BUY SOMETHING ELSE","This is a case of tampering with a great product, and fouling it up.The original Black Ice was wonderful. It operated quietly in the background, keeping bad guys at bay. Then they ""upgraded it"". They made it obtrusive and a nag, interrupting all normal computer use with nagging messages and questions. The problem is, if you set it at the highest security questions, you get nagging messages at every turn. Even if you want to open a game, offline, with broadband disconnected, you get a Black Ice pop-up.To decrease the interruptions, you have to lower the level of security. Not a good trade-off.Then the other day, it just went crazy and seized control of my computer, basically locking me out. No matter what I wanted to do, it shut me down. Kind of like the Matrix. I finally had to reboot and restart in safe mode to uninstall Black Ice. I've gone out and bought a new firewall program."
4,"Cheap, Easy to Use, Lasts a Long Time","With DSL, a static IP and extended up-times, I felt it necessary to have some 'protection' on my machine. After reading all the reviews on Amazon, and the descriptive literature on Black Ice and its competitors, I was inclined to go with Black Ice. When I learned it was also the 'defender of choice' for my employer, I was pretty convinced. Installation was a snap; updating via their website is quick and easy; I have had no anomolous failures (Win98-based) of any sort since. The product's 'Attack' and 'Traffic' histories are interesting reading - I seem to be probed by web crawlers pretty frequently. In short: Black Ice does the job; highly recommended."
3,XP Not Compatible,"Black Ice performed fine for me under Windows 98, but with graduation to Windows XP, I experienced frequent crashes. Microsoft alluded to Black Ice as the problem and suggested that I update to Version 3.0 or better. Unfortunately, as of this writing, there is no V. 3.0 for Black Ice.A switch to the Norton firewall has yielded greatly increased stability.The following error analysis was received from Microsoft on 2/19/02:""BlackIce defender version 2.9 or earlier is installed on your machine. BlackIce Defender version 2.9 and earlier are known to cause this crash. Please contact Internet Security Systems ...to get an updated driver (3.0 or later) that should correct this problem.This event report has been processed and analyzed. We determined that this crash event was caused by the following module:BlackDrv.sysThis module was produced by Network ICE Corporation. For more information, contact Network ICE Corporation"""
2,Black Ice - minimal protection,"I had previously used Black Ice defender, and it blocked incoming probes, but it allowed outbound connections by installed programs (spyware etc). Not exactly what I had in mind. Then I got Zone Alarm Pro and it catches everything, inbound and outbound, which seems like a better solution."
2,End of Life! Finally!,"I bought this way back in 2001 after my credit card number was stolen off the net. It worked ok for someone inexperienced with security, but now that I know what to protect against, I found out you can get better firewalls for free. I use Tall Emu's Online Armor. Zone Alarm is another good free one.And now I read that IBM (who now owns Black Ice) is ending support and updates to Black Ice in Sept 2008. You've been warned! Get another firewall!"
5,Happy beyond words....,"I heard the song ""Ladder of Lovers"" years ago in college, and was unable to find it, since I had not written down the artist's name. I love this song, and am totally thrilled that it's been released. Thanks!"
5,Handy For Quick Draining,"Love this tool for fast draining for a few pieces from cooking pan. I do not use it a lot but it is always there when I need it and great for the job, easy to clean and lasts forever."
3,Surprised to see its made in China.,"The product description saysProduct Features* 4.7-Inch by 13.8- inch skimmer for removing froth, draining pasta, fried food* Made of 18/10 stainless steel with satin finish handle* Grooved handle for secure grip* Comes with a lifetime warranty* Safe to use in dishwasher; made in GermanyThe skimmer came with a sticker saying made in China. I'm disappointed in the deception; I thought I was paying a high price for a German made item. It is a robust skimmer though."
4,The Handy book for Genealogists: USA,Good book to have for reference while doing genealogist research. I find the state maps showing the counties especially interesting....very easy to read and gives one an idea where the area is. Also the county seat listings and addresses are helpful..Worth the money which is quite reasonable for a nice book like this. I purchased a used library copy which was like new and cheaper than new.
4,Handy Book for Genealogists,"I had an earlier edition of this book and Hurricane Katrina got it, so I knew that this later edition would be updated on all the information contained in it. I had no idea just how outdated my old one was! I have had reason to refer to this book several times in the short time I have had it.The only complaint I have is that it is very heavy, otherwise I am very happy with the detailed information it contains.I think this book is a must for any genealogist."
3,Not The Best,I would suggest the Internet or looking for another book to find better sources for and information on research/genealogy.
3,The Handybook for Genealogists : United States of America (10th Edition,I was led to believe it contained other information. Although helpful in a sense I didn't realize it was a list of places to go for information in certain areas. Not a list of geneological information.
5,Beautiful,For classic Music Lovers and Vampire Lovers this is a wonderful mix.The voice is Hipnotic. I have built a story board and Choreographer a number for it.
5,classical with a twist,"I've had the cassette for 12 years now, and I listen to it at least once a month, that I've decided it's time to get the CD (before I completely wear out the cassette). The best way to describe the music is that it is classical with a twist. The music, like most classical, draws the listener in, but Immmortal Kiss does it with its hint of sensuality. You cannot help but listen and become entwined within the music. It's some of the best mood music out there for reading or otherwise. For those who enjoy romantic, hot, candle-lit baths, this is definitely the best mood music there is."
5,Book 2 of 6 of a helluva Sci Fi Series,"Continues the story of a post-nuke USA run by the First Family (underground in a clean, safe environ). The surface is dominated by a group collectively called the Mutes (for Mutants) and the Iron Lords (Japanese that occupy the eastern US). Steve Brickman, the hero starts out as a shining member of the USA's flying force (called a Cloud Warrior by the Mutes), but finds himself in a number of intrigues that run a total of 6 books. Great reading. duellist@interserv.co"
3,A meticulous study of high-tech tyranny.,"If you are keen on exploring the tyrannical potential of high technology, you can't do worst than to start here. This is '1984' updated into the info-tech age, makes Winston Smith's life in Airstrip One seem like a totally relaxed seaside holiday in Blackpool! The definitive word in hi-tech dystopia novel, it ranks way up there with 'Brave New World', 'THX 1138', 'The Glass Tower', etc. It is also 1 of the all-time best post-Apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers ever written, IMHO. Cross Adolf Hitler with Bill Gates and Dale Carnegie, stir in Ph.D's for social-psychology and electronic engineering , and you get the 'First Family' of the book's title. A must-read!!! Anyone who knows Patrick's email address pls pls pls contact me - I've been wanting to compliment him personally for a long-while now!"
4,Not bad in a good series,"Good slice-em up action series.Book six ended rather abruptly and left you wondering?, well whats next...I expected book seven..."
2,Better alternatives out there,"I've used cable concealers of all types to help hide away hdmi and power cords, speaker cables, power cables, ethernet cables. Of all the different types I've used, including the very good Belkin hideaway cord concealer, this one is by far the worst. It's pretty cumbersome to install, the sticky tape comes off fairly easily, and it doesn't sit very cleanly on the wall. Plus, the whole thing is only 4 feet long, which really doesn't help when you're trying to hide away a cord from ceiling to floor. People also mention that you can only put in 1 cable cord on each side, for a max of two cable or power cords, and this is definitely true, as well as a huge limitation for home theater use."
2,"Not flush, not worth it.","Although all the pictures show the edges of the covers flush to the wall, and it advertises that you can paint the cover, in reality there's a very significant ~2mm gap between the edge of the curved cover and the wall itself. It's large enough that you can't possible cover it up with a liberal dose of paint, like I was planning to do.The shadow caused by the cover makes the gap very visible, and honestly it looks awful, like I've slapped a cheap piece of plastic over my wires.On the upside, it's extremely easy to mount, and the adhesive mounting means that when I take this off my wall to throw it away, I won't have left a mark."
1,Plastic junk,"3 pieces of plastic for $30. Totally not worth it. These pieces barely hold two wires, not nearly big enough if you've got a coaxial and some component cables. The pieces are flimsy and cheap looking next to a nice flat screen TV. Just junk. Don't say you weren't warned."
3,Ok wire cover,I bought these to hide a couple cables and that is all it will handle you could maybe get a extra one in there but that is it. The are easy to install and I would recommend screwing it to the wall because no matter what adhesive you have it will wear out especially if you are trying to hide cables from kids.
3,Ok wall cover,OmniMount CMK Mini 2-Inch Cable Management CoversI have a couple cords running from my living room TV. The bracket that secures the mount to wall does not secure that well and keeps popping off.
2,The cheapest way to go,If your looking for the fastest and cheapest way to cover cords on your walls I guess this is your product. You can only hide a few cords. Power cords are thicker and have a tougher time being tucked away behind these covers. You have the option of screwing the snaps to these covers into the wall or simply using their stickers to hold them up. You then stap on the outer cover you see in the picture to the brackets. Either way the covers continually pop off. You have to paint these if you want a flush look.
2,You get what you see,"This product does the job it says: covers wires, however the do not say it barely holds in the wires actually used for TV's and/or DVD players or other things. The covers are more to cover tiny, thin wires, ore just 1. I tried to use it to cover the TV wire and the DVD player wire and it doesn't work. So DO NOT buy this if you are trying to cover more than 1 wire at a time."
2,Not worth the money,"This is a nicely made product, pretty well thought out but they could make inside and outside corner pieces maybe as an option. Overall, you get very little material for the money. Three sections of 16"" pieces and one corner? It's a rip for the $$."
1,Bad discription of inside of covers.,"I ordered these covers for my RCA 5 cables.The cables measured 1 1/2in they should of fit.They did not say there was clips on the inside,with a middle support.They only allow for 1/2 cable on each side,That left one cable on the outside.Had to return this product & order the 4in, hope it works,did not want to go so big. Very disappointed with the info,should of showed better pictures of the inside with clips.Now have to wait to finish my TV. More to come after install...."
1,crap,"didn't work for me, i rent an apartment, so i can't put so many hole in the was, this thing won't stick if u don't drill it into the wall"
5,Worked great for a couple cables,"I was able to use this set for two places !! Our 19"" kitchen t.v. is above our hutch with on a swivel mount , you could always see the wires coming out from behind the hutch up to the t.v.. These were easy to put on , I used the screw method , put the wires in the track and snapped on the cover ....EASY !! Our walls are white ,so it hid them very well and I only used one section of it !! I did the same in our bedroom , however we have wood paneling in there.....so I went to the dollar store and bought some wood grained looking contact paper , cut it to the size of the cover and it stuck to it very well !! and its hard to see it !! And if I ever move it , just peel of contact paper and change the color ...they have alot of different colors o contact paper !! Only used 2 of the sections of track and made two t.v.'s look professional installed ....Glad I bought them !!!!!"
1,Junk,"Stay away, it's a piece of junk. The materials used are cheap and its probably a better idea to go to your local audio visual store to get a good look at what you're buying."
4,It gets the job done,"Package arrived intact, and all parts were accounted for.You can mount these using included screws and wall anchors, or they have included double sided foam tape.Pros:Installs quickCan be paintedSeparates power and VideoCons:No splice pieces (they just butt up against each other)Very flimsy flexible plastics makes for a lightweight product, but seems cheapDoes not lay flush to the wallOverall a good buy, I just wish it laid flush and had splice pieces."
4,Good Product,"Colour is off-white not white. Adhesive is pretty weak, you will be much better off with self tapping screws in the corners. Light weight and does not scratch easily."
2,You make me feel like Danson,"Ten years ago I saw COUSINS at the movies and wondered why, after the first wedding scene, how William Peterson got invited to the second wedding in the film.Lead actor Ted Danson does a good job in COUSINS and his performance alone makes it worth seeing, if only on cable TV. Danson could have played it safe in his career outside of ""Cheers"", playing only Sam Malone-type characters(which he does in A FINE MESS). But in work such as SOMETHING ABOUT AMELIA and, in this case, COUSINS, he's willing to challenge his fans with, to say the least, controversial subject matter.Despite the premise, COUSINS beyond the kissin' is not too compelling, except for the late, loony Lloyd Bridges, the above-mentioned Peterson, and of course Ted Danson. Give COUSINS a try on cable TV; perhaps you will like it more than I did. But if you don't, at least you will not have travelled to a theatre and spent money, as I did, to find that out."
1,Joel Schumacher's worst misfire,"While I have great respect for the director of St. Elmo's Fire and A Time to Kill, this box-office failure is truly a weak, meandering melodrama that does not deserve to be watched. While the plot may not be the worst part of the film, the saccharine aloofness with which the subject matter is treated is enough to bore and disappoint anyone who has seen at least one good romantic comedy in his or her life. The last five minutes of the movie may be redeemed somewhat by a lyrical musical score and a few beautiful scenes in Schumacher's usual style; however, you are still most likely to leave the room in an empty mood of deep disappointment. If you don't find The Lost Boys, Batman & Robin and 8mm sufficient proof that even the creator of some essential movies of the last two decades can have his dark hours, see this movie, and it is almost guaranteed that you'll change your mind. Otherwise, watch out and see Falling Down instead."
4,Romantic fun,Isabella Rossellini is so feminine that the other women in the movie seem ordinary. The story is different. It is a light movie to watch when you have a little time to yourself and just want to enjoy it.
5,Pure Romance!!,"What can I say about this movie except that Isabella and Ted create real chemistry as two people who have scored a big zero with love in their lives and suddenly find ""true love"" with each other! It is so much fun to watch their relationship develop from two people who are hurt by their significant others to a couple who find they are madly in love. Worth watching over and over again!"
5,Awesome Movie,"I love this movie, because remember some time in my life.Buy it's a really cute movie."
4,cousins,"This is a fun movie. It was great to see a young Wm Peterson, quite different from Grishom from CSI. Of course the story line of the two main characters was good. The web we weave while trying to deceive, they only wanted to make there partners believe they were having an affair to get even, and found themselves becoming friends, and of course falling in love, and of course everyone knew because it was always evident at the large family weddings they had to attend. Very intertwined, funny, romantic, just a good easy movie to watch."
2,A Disappointment,"Everyone told me how funny this book was but I didn't laugh once! I thought the main character was a bimbo who at her age, should have known better. It was hard to feel anything for her apart from pity at her being so thick!All the references to Britain being cold, miserable and full of hard hearted toffs I thought were very narrow minded, and sounded suspiciously like Kathy Lette had done the typical visitor to Britain's trick of never leaving London!It hasn't inspired me to read any more of her books, although if I come across one for 10p at a jumble sale back in the UK, I might buy it out of curiosity!"
4,Good Fun!,"I really enjoy Lette's style of writing, as well as her ascerbic wit. It makes me laugh out loud. Her writing reminds me of a cross between Carrie Fisher and Nora Ephron with an Anglo/Aussie bent. An entertaining read."
4,90's Love Story,"Very funny, definitely a true to form 90's love story. The ever trusting Australian girl and the upmarket married English gentleman. A laugh from cover to cover. Maddie's description of natural child-birth is a true to life, crude look at what realy happens before that ""cuddly-little-baby"" is born."
5,"Laugh a minute, love story of outcasts in the Nineties!","One of the most humourous books ever read by this very talented Australian author. A tale of a modern love story, it's ups and downs and inside outs!! An out and out laugh at real love and real life"
5,Ant Trip Ceremony - '24 Hours' (Cicadalic Records),"OMG! That was my first thought. Never even heard of this obscure psychedelic band made up of students from the college in Oberlin, Ohio. Album first came out in 1968 in a limited edition of something like 500 copies. Twelve mind-altering tracks to provide more brain damage for your time, effort and money. Tunes here I was digging the most were their unreal cover of the Leave's ""Hey Joe"", the seven-minute ""Elaborations"", the stunning ""Riverdawn"", the all-out psychedelic ""Violets Of Dawn"", ""Locomotive Lamp"" and their Willie Dixon cover ""Little Baby"". Ant Trip Ceremony successfully fuses together blues, psych, folk, jazz and improvisation. Line-up: George Galt - bass, harmonica, harp & vocals, Steve Detray - guitar, Gary Rosen - rhythm guitar & vocals, Mark Stein - guitar & flute and Jeff Williams - drums. Should appeal to fans of Ultimate Spinach, Peanut Butter Conspiracy, Afterglow, Neighb'r'hood Children and the Great Society."
2,Not very good,"Shanks's book provides a good argument for corporate election, which is, however, unconvincing. His answers to some of the proof-texts for Calvinism are very weak. For a theological defense of Calvinism, see Calvinism and Evangelical Arminianism by Girardeau. For answers to Shank's proof texts, see The Cause of God and Truth by John Gill. For a strong argument for the Calvinist doctrine of the sovereignty of God, read ""The Sovereignty of God"" by Pink. For a refutation of Shank's theory of the atonement, and his proof-texts against particular redemption, see ""The Death of Death"" by John Owen. I commend Shank for writing against what he considers to be error.However, I found his arguments weak."
2,Children's Story?,"A book about the world as the baby Jesus saw it after his birth . . . just shapes and colours. Seems to be a child's tale at first, but no child would probably get much out of it. Just a few words, and some pictures. I wasn't that impressed, but the story and method of presentaion may be charming enough for some readers. Not Vonnegut's best effort. Although, it is original! I've never seen an approach even remotely close to the one taken here."
2,Children's book,"I was kind of shocked to find out this is a children's book being that Vonnegut is a satirist. However, even thought it is a children's book I wouldn't have been so disappointed if I knew that the drawings to go with Vonnegut's story were no even drawings. Some pages are just all one colour. ex. all green then another all purple, then another all yellow. I tried to do research on this before buying it but because it is so rare I found nothing, that is why I am writing this for others."
3,Not a bad movie at all!,"Pretty okay movie - I must say! The plot was there and pretty easy to follow. The fighting scenes - not bad at all. There's always a white haired villan in most Kung Fu movies you have to get rid off. Well, this is one of these movies. The last fighting scene could have been much longer though. Come on, you know the last fighting scene is the climax of it all and it has to summarize everything. Overall, I've seen a lot worst. See my other reviews. Perhaps you'll know which ones not to waste your time on."
5,Can't Get Enough of the Magic School Bus,My grandson comes over my house frequently and always asks to watch the Magic School Bus baseball video. He's seen it so much that he has memorized most if not all of the words. There's barely enough time to rewind it before he wants to watch it over and over again. He's three years old and all of the videos from the Magic School Bus are great for kids to start learning about sience in and around his age level.
4,Not as secure as their other cases,"Unlatches rather easily. Still should protect your PDA from light to moderate splashing if you're careful handling it so it won't open. It's actually bigger than I thought from looking at the pictures (it easily fit my old Compaq iPaq). If you want a MUCH better case, look at the Otterbox 1900."
1,O-ring seal issues,"I've had my otter box 2600 stored in the box since july, 2009 because i didn't need it until the start of my softball season. we played a game this past tuesday, and the o-ring popped right out. since then, i've tried everything to put it back in place to no avail. Naturally, the whole purpose of the case, waterproof, is damaged, now that i can't keep the plastic face plate in place and water tight! Worse product i've ever spent money on! i would actually rate it zero stars!"
4,Perhaps the best carrier of WWII...,"As I'm sure most model makers and naval history buffs can atest, there is little information out there when it comes to the Graf Zeppelin. Breyer's work is an - perhaps thee - exception. Since many WWII Allied diagrams of the Graf Zepplin were flawed, the pictures included are a MUST for anyone trying to build their own scale model of Germany's only aircraft carrier. History buffs too will find a lot worth reading, from the ship itself to the flight systems to even the intended air wing. All in all, a good source of information, though there obviously isn't a lot out there to compare it too when it comes to this often forgotten warship."
4,"Excellent Chiller of A Novel, and Resident Evil to boot","For anyone who has played Resident Evil 2 whether the PlayStation version or the N64 version then this book may be worth only a couple of read throughs. For people who haven't played the game but love horror movies, or books then this is definitely worth the money. The reason that even those who have played the game to the bitter end and know the plot, it's nice to read the novel and be able to understand exactly how everything fits together. The only problem that I had with the book is that the author has side stepped the majority of the puzzles that are in the game, but this is understandable considering how long the book would be otherwise. Overall this book is worth the purchase and there shouldn't be a person out there that claims to be a Resident Evil fan and doesn't have this book."
5,New Found Fan,"I am a new fan to the 'Resident Evil' saga. The first RE game I played was RE2, and I found it very interesting. Just the other week I was looking through a Walden Books store and I found that the RE saga was also in novel form.I picked up the book and read only a couple pages when I was hooked. I bought 'City of the Dead' and finished it in one week. The book was excellent! I liked the way the author carefully detailed the zombies, the Re3 (the Licker) and Mr.X, the genetically enhanced creature that stalked Sherry Birkin and Claire Redfield. Shortly after reading the book I struck up a strong interest in the saga. By the way, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield are my favorite characters.Overall I fully enjoyed 'Resident Evil 2: City of the Dead'. The detail really outstanded me and I get the full effect when I read it at midnight! Great stuff...now I get to collect the entire novel series!"
5,Best In The Resident Evil Series!,Out of all the RE books this shapes up to be the best one. It is by far the longest out of the series by like 100 and something pages. It also has a very good storyline that tops off the other Resident Evil book. There's also some new creatures in this one that weren't in one and two. The details are by far the best in this one describeing everything with a passion. The details are still gory. The book will really drag you in and won't let you go untill your done reading it. This one is going to take you a little longer then the first two but it's very rewarding. If you like RE games or the first two books pick this up. After your done reading it your going to wan't more so why not go pick up RE 4.
5,The greatest video game novelization ever!!!!!!!,"This is a great book! I like the second game better than the first one, especially the villians, and S.D. Perry is a great author. Play the game, and read the book right after you beat it! (IF you can beat it that is....)"
2,If you played the game....don't read the book...,"I have read all of the Resident Evil novels and this one by far the longest...and dullest. If you have played the Resident Evil 2 game, reading the book is a waste of time. I was pretty much skipping every other word as I hurried thru the book to see if there was anything that the book told, that the game did not. There was very little and the little there stated in the book was not enough to justify reading it. It is a book to have in your collection and a good book for someone who has not played to game, to read and get a good grip on what is going on in Resident Evil 2 before actually playing game."
2,Perry writes for children and Capcom allowed it!,Only young readers who have no idea of what a good book is would give Perry's novels a good rating.I laughed more than anything at Perry's poor attemtps to interest me with her weak characters.
5,Almost as good as The Umbrella Conspiracy,This book was awesome! I read the entire thing in one day because i couldnt put it down. I could find no flaws at all with the book. I was espescially glad that the author followed the LeonA/ClaireB set up because i liked playing that in the game more than ClaireA/LeonB scenario.
5,The most addicting book and series you'll ever read!,"I have read 1,2 and now three of the series. I read each one in a day. Once you start reading you cant stop you have to keep turning pages to find out what is going on. I have played the games, but you dont have to have played the games to like the books they clue you in to everyones background and history so you know whats going on. The action is fast and exciting. you never know whats going to happen next (unless you have played the game). Very few books have impressed me that the way this series has. Cant wait to finish Underworld. This series is a must buy for Sci fi lovers."
4,Dreadfully Delightful,"With the third installment of S. D. Perry's ""Resident Evil"" series it comes as no surprise the the corrupt Umbrella Corporation is churning out all sorts of sick surprises. G-Virus, Tyrants and Chestbursters (a not so subtle reference to the ""Aliens"" line of books Perry previously penned) are among the offerings in this outing. A bit more innovative than the two previous entries, it moves smoothly with each chapter carrying the reader's interest along with an even flow from page to page. This novel proves an easy transition to Perry's next ""RE"" novel entitled ""Underworld""."
1,Not made in Germany,"For the premium price and history of this company, I thought it was Made in Germany. It is not so I have returned it. Please put the country of Manufacturer for all cookware items."
1,Anything but pleased,"I bought two of these cards to upgrade from my old 802.11b cards. These are used on two diferent brands of laptops within twenty feet of the wireless router. I experience several dropped connections per night with many requiring a reboot to reconnect. I am using the most recent drivers, so I think these are just poor units."
2,Mixed Results with SMC 2835w,"I was using this PCMCIA wireless card with an old SONY Vaio laptop with windows 98se installed, and it worked great. (I'm also using the SMC 2804WBR router as a WAP). Now I upgraded to Compaq Presario 2199US with AMD Athalon and WIndows XP (SP1a) and the board looses the connection every 30 seconds or so at a distance of 60 feet. I've tried installing the latest drivers, searchig the web for answers, but no luck yet. I have found the SMC router to work great and it was cheap, however, their tech support, manuals, web site, and documentation all stink. Personally, I would stay away from this card unless you like wasting alot of time."
2,Technical problems,"I've had the same issue as some other reviewers. The card worked great at first, but for a while now it will hold a good connection for 30 seconds or so and then lose it for a while. I decided to try it on a brand new machine with a clean software install and new drivers but had the same issue. You're best bet is to probably go for another card."
2,"Good start, bad finish","It was easy to install this on my Toshiba Windows XP notebook. The first dozen or so times I used it, the card worked fine. I didn't use it daily- probably about once or twice a week. But recently when I try to use it, my computer freezes up. It won't even connect before it freezes. My computer runs great otherwise, so I know that the freezing is because of the card."
2,Although Fibonacci tools,"can do a great job in your trading, this is not the way you can use them. The main concern is always what pivots you use to draw a spiral or to draw the fibonacci time goals. It certainly looks great in hindsight but what about the swing pivoz highs and lows you use. Where is the rule for using ceratin pivots or swings. Sorry, this is a very soundly written book, but what is the real deal when it comes to real trading?"
3,Ehhhh,Not what I expected. Was dissapointed by the book to be honest . I love cookbooks Ihave nearly 300 and still going... this one wont be a keeper.
1,piece of junk,"Do not buy this VCR. I had this one for six months, and had trouble with VCR not accepting tapes. Cover where tapes are put in came off. I sent it back to Circuit City, and bought a Sony."
3,Panasonic VCRS,"I had problems when I tried to get Panasonic to repair an old VCR but it seemed to fix itself. I have 2 Panasonic VCRs now, and I like the older model with easier VCR+. The newer one defaults to a different programming tool. I also hate the Commercial Advance which prevents you from changing the tape to tape another program immediately after."
2,Broken out of the box,"Unit has nice features for the price, but mine refused to accept any videotape--old or new--from Day 1. Panasonic Customer Service is difficult to contact, poorly trained, and generally unresponsive."
4,Works for me,"This is my third Panasonic VCR. It does everything it should. The commercial skip works about half the time, but I don't think that is the fault of the unit. I only wish it came in black."
1,PANASONIC PRODUCTS ARE WORTHLESS,"I purchased this Panasonic VCR mainly because of its price. A gear completely broke in under 6 months (with light usage), causing a tapr to be stuck inside the VCR. Panasonic's ""1 year warranty"" is really no warranty at all because they do NOT cover the cost of labor, and you can't just get a replacement, you have to take it to a service center, which costs more then the VCR itself. I have had other Panasonic products, including cordless phones, and the products and the company are terrible to deal with. A waste of money, and I will no longer purchase Pansonic products."
1,"While it does have nice features, it is not nicely made.","I bought this model and it died after less than 3 months. Specifically, the tape eject motor died and the faceplate fell off very easily. Their customer service was very unhelpful and it would have cost me almost $70 to get a replacement from Panasonic. Be careful buying this unit."
5,Hard to beat for the price!,"I'm very impressed by these set of speakers. For the price they are almost unbeatable. If you plan on using them for a small room, like me, they are perfect. The highs and mids are bright and vibrant and the bass isn't boomy like my sony speakers but rather nice and clear. Deserves 5 stars!"
