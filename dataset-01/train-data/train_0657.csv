1,Does much more harm than good,"If children are taught the inaccuracies from this book, they'll start life with a disadvantage. Science and history are not inconvenient truths that should be edited or whitewashed away just because they don't compliment an ideology."
1,What about the bible?,"I am just a little concerned about this book. Even though I am an evolution believing atheist, I am familiar with the bible and its stories. And nowhere in the bible did it ever mention dinosaurs. This author is perpetuating lies to his fellow believers in the fact that he is inserting dinosaurs into the bible story. This is analogous to mixing computers into Gone With The Wind, cell phones into Jane Eyre, or spaceships into A Picture of Dorian Gray. I guess if someone threw Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer into the Santa story, this could work, too."
1,Child abuse in book form,"It's sad that there are some people out there who would cripple their children's minds with this garbage.We laughed and laughed until we realized that there are some people who believe this junk.The ""author"" should actually learn some ""science"""
1,Epic lols,I think my favorite picture is the one of the raptor eating leaves. This book is insanity writ large.
1,"Grade level 4, Intellectual level 0","Zero stars. In a wasted effort, kool-ade drinker Ken Ham of the Creationist Museum has put together a appalling piece of farcical, propagandistic nonsense that completely disregards established science. In a blatant and ill-conceived attempt to indoctrinate children with falsehoods, Ham has concocted a specious fairy tale 'history' with no basis in reality.Attempting to pass off the absurd notion that the age of the Earth (and by extension that of the Universe) can be computed according to a chronological timeline of biblical personages as first proposed by Bishop Ussher in the mid 1600's is one thing, presenting such spurious hogwash in a picture book to brainwash little children is an entirely different matter. That Amazon actually posted this blurb (""this fun family book will transport you on a breathtaking journey through the ""time-gate"" of the Bible, the true history book of the universe!"") is an affront to any sentient being."
1,"This book is completely wrong. Funny, but wrong.","I thought this was satire.. honestly, it's hilarious!It's quite sad that people read this and believe it, they also have their children read it/read it to them and tell them to believe it too. This book is backed up by no evidence, it is a complete work of fiction and it should not be read and taken seriously by anyone. This is what is wrong with so many people, they are so eager to disprove science that they will accept even the most ridiculous arguments and then have the audacity to say the evidence is wrong."
1,I'm horrified Amazon considers this history,"Even if a person takes the bible as literal history, not the parables most mainline (non fundamental) Christians interpret it as, I question that person has ever actually read the bible. There's no mention of dinosaurs. Denying the fossil record and carbon dating as the devils work are we?Be my guest, buy this and read it to your kids as the literal truth of God. That will only make the children less equipped to compete with my children in this ever technological scientific world.Also be aware that you are creating a child who will never trust their parents to tell them the truth since that child has been lied to them about everything from Santa Claus to the Tooth Fairy."
1,"If only I could've given it zero ""stars"".","Outright falsity masquerading as truth; this book exists solely to poison the minds of innocent children. When we should be letting our children explore ""how"" to think about the world, books like this one (and other assaults against reason and logic like the Bible) are corrupting their minds and filling them with Iron Age garbage.Books such as this one should be in the Humor for Adults category so that the absurdities contained therein can be appreciated for what they are."
1,What a disgrace!,This would be hilarious as a joke book - if the author wasn't knowingly profiting out of filling innocent kids' heads with such misinformation and rubbish. He should be ashamed of himself.
1,Yellow bananas were created by man,"Ken Ham is a total con artist. The book is completely untrue - made up stuff so that the gullible will buy it.It's disgusting. Any middle schooler could do the experiment to prove that Earth has been her longer than Ken Ham says. People were doing metal working in Britain in 6000BC and were using boats to cross oceans in 10,000 BC. We even have art from South Africa."
1,PROTECT your children from these cognitive predators. Rubbish from the Lunatic Fringe!,"PROTECT your children from these cognitive predators. Rubbish from the Lunatic Fringe!1-star because there is no option for ZERO stars.This garbage is straight form the American Taliban.Kids are smart. If they are given half a chance, they will find the real world, the real universe wondrous and awe-inspiring, and they will feel a deep sense of belonging -- at home in the Cosmos that brought them into existence.This stuff written in this book is poisonous, irrational, anti-historical, & damaging to young minds.Stand up for those little people you know & love & RESIST the imposition of this foolishness on them.Buy a kid a real book -- then read it with them."
1,US Robotics V.92 (USR5686D) Modem,"This product IS NOT backwards compatible with 56KFlex or V.90 service providers even though US Robotics claims ""V.90 56K and x2 technology compatible"". It may function correctly if your service provider has upgraded to the new V.92 digital service but, if not, you'll be very disappointed and very lucky to connect as high as 28Kbps. US Robotics admits the modem has problems connecting at advertised speeds with V.90 service providers and I would not recommend purchase until US Robotics can prove they have fixed the flaw."
4,U.S. Robotics V.92 (USR5686D) Modem 2007 Update,"Most Internet Service Providers, today (2007), have V.92 digital support for this modem. Call your I.S.P. to find out if they provide V.92 connection capability, thus ensuring that this modem will work for your purpose. This is a very good hardware based modem from one of the best modem manufacturers in the world. :-)"
4,Rev up your cluncker,"I have been too sentimental towards my Dell Dimension XPS to chuck it into the garbage bin. So I thought I'd add some RAM to see how the performance would improve. I doubled my RAM by adding 32 MB of Viking EDO Ram. The performance is better, especially for surfing the web. ...."
5,must buy with your digital camera,"fyi, with my canon S100 digital elph at normal fine photo quality, this 64mb cf card stores about 108 photos. on my dell laptop with NT and Linux, both OSes recognize the adapter. on NT, I had to install the Softex PC card controller program downloaded from support.dell.com. After it's installed the Viking adapter becomes a hot swappable removable drive. On Linux, cardmgr recognizes the adapter, and fdisk recognizes it as FAT12. However, the default kernel doesn support FAT12, so you'd need to compile the support in yourself (2.2.17 is what I'm using)."
2,Nothing New ... Quite Disappointing,"While I have enjoyed the Family Manager series, I was disappointed with this the latest title in the series. It's simply a re-hash of Peel's earlier works. In a way I feel ripped off by the publisher for simply repackaging what I already paid for in previous books"
1,Oprah blew it on this Book,"I saw this book promoted on Oprah recently, so on her recommendation I bought it. My assessment is that anyone with a lick of common sense already knows everything in this book. I am very disappointed both in content and delivery and wonder what Oprah was thinking. Maybe she didn't read it but just took her staffs' word?"
3,ARMORED and DANGEROUS,"Admittedly, I'm not a huge mecha fan, but VOTOMS reminded me an awful lot of shows like G.I. JOE, one of my all-time favorites. So I felt compelled to give this book a second look, and I'm glad that I did.VOTOMS is jam-packed with action, mecha battles and stuff blowing up. The characters are rather hard edged, and you get a sense that the stakes they're fighting for are pretty high.The art is done in a more American style than an actual manga, and the full-color print job keeps everything looking slick. It'd be interesting to see an actual manga version of this story.However, the real treat for me was the bonus materials, which offered some interesting insights into the history of the anime show, the characters, and their world."
5,This is a great bargain for a beautiful bracelet!!,I got this for my birthday and love it. I have a pearl necklace and it matches perfectly. The pearls are of very high quality and good size. The luster is excellent in this item. I am very happy with this product and the price was a steal!!
4,Akoya Saltwater Pearl Bracelet,"The actual product, i.e. the pearls are terrific, but if you plan on giving this as a gift - the box they come in could use some improvement. Otherwise the quality of the actual product is good."
1,Where's the K&N??,"bought it here cause it's the cheapest K&N air filter i found. that was a mistake! i was sent a K&N box, but a FRAM air filter! thank God i was reimbursde, and got to keep the air filter."
3,Not for budget travellers,"I bought this book to use as we campervan our way around the East coast of Australia. I usually go with Lonely Planet, but based on some of the review I read, Fodor's seemed a better choice. However, I soon realized this book would be useless to us. It doesn't include any campsites or other budget accommodation, and doesn't have any information on hiking trails etc. I was also very disappointed at the lack of pictures - I wish I'd noticed this before I ordered. This book is on its way back to Amazon and I've ordered the Lonely Planet books - I should have stuck with them in the first place. Fodors would be great for anyone wanting to stay on the beaten path, staying at expensive hotels. For budget travel/back packing/camping, I think LP is the way to go!"
2,A little small but cute,I like these because they are so cute looking and nice and thick but they are just a bit on the small side
2,could have been designed and made better,"There should be grommetts in the bottom/ floor of the bag, so water drains out and the way the shoulder pad is affixed to the sholder strap (backwards) makes it impossible to shorten the shoulder strap by more than half, so that you cannot adjust the strap to fit snugly under your arm. Tthe best you can do is adjust it so that it hangs at or below your belt. Pretty stupid when you think about it, you are in surf fishing, so it pretty much guarantees that it will get water inside and you will have to empty the bag after each use."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this rain suit. I bought it, especially after seeing the above review, since I too bicycle to commute. I'm not sure if they sent me a different rain suit or what, but the one I got didn't have the overall pants. I bike an hour each way and, after the first ride, the pants have holes around the bicycle seat area and the material is breaking down at other points in the pants as well. The jacket immediately started coming away from the bottom snap. (Definitely not a ""rugged"" suit!) I didn't have a problem with being too hot, although perhaps that is because this is springtime in New England. I wouldn't bother buying this suit unless your commute is quite short."
5,Great Afro-Boriqua rythms.,"Plena Libre encompases PR's African roots and joins them nicely with the dominant Spanish influence of the island. As an avid colector of Caribean music, I recommend this album.Thanks"
1,disappointed,"The book got into too much extra hoopla. When I first heard about the book I was soooo interested, but it seemed the authors got into what they thought more than what the original authors thought."
2,Who says Latinos can't be discriminatory against Blacks!?,"Oftentimes, when the media discuss ""Black-Latino tensions"", they speak of the matter as if Blacks discriminate against Latinos, but that the reverse can never happen. This book shows how untrue that is. This book is supposed to be about a grumpy old man who learns about life through his odd interactions with a black youth. Instead, we get a patronizing look at how an old white man supposedly leads a dumb black kid to be upstanding. This book is not a great contribution to Latino literature as the character is practically portrayed as any other white ethnic, rather than a minority in the United States. I was generally disappointed by this book and I hope the author does a better job in his other works."
5,Very nice,"I am so used to hearing Horowitz play most of these pieces that it took me several times to adjust to these renditions. Now that I've made the adjsutment, I find myself really loving both. Klara Wurtz has a light softness to her playing that is refreshing and articulate. There is less heavy-handedness to the base as is typically heard in Horowitz recordings. I like her balance and clear comfort with the musical score. She handles the technicality beautifully without making an issue of it which allows a smoother flow and clearer attention to the expression. Bravo Klara Wurtz!"
2,good book for the Typical Male Type,"If you aren't a sports buff or into drinking beer- if you don't go out with the guys for male bonding activites, you will find this book sadly disappointing. We are saving it for another friend of ours-- she has a husband that fits the description of the dad in the book. Coach of the soccer team, football etc.My husband says it was a bit amusing, but mostly he had a hard time making himself read it after the first few pages.... we will keep trying to find something else for him, or maybe I can convince him to write a book instead!"
5,We thinks gold dust of 'em.,"Matthau's performance as Cpt. Bartholomew Red should have earned him a golden throne, and the supporting characters are just as good. This is a much grittier & more believable story than the popular Disney series, so its UNavailability on DVD is frustrating. The castaway captain & his long-suffering first mate (the Frog) make their way aboard a Spanish galleon and repeatedly attempt to pirate it. Its murderous first mate and beautiful passenger interfere with both the plunder, and Cpt. Red's control over the Frog. It's too bad Matthau couldn't reprise this role in the Depp series. Sadly, due to Polanski's felony warrant, this film will probably never be officially re-released in the US or on a region-1 DVD."
4,Reason why the movie is pretty much banned in the U.S.,"Because Pulanski was hit with criminal charges, and ran to Europe to escape, the Federal government banned his stuff. I saw it in the 80's and now I am a history teacher. The movie puts it an an authentic situation. The large chain that protects the harbor of Maracaibo, the ship, the costumes."
5,wish I could have found this on DVD,This was one of my favorite movies growing up and after watching it it still is a really fun movie to watch. I only wish that I could find this on DVD at a fare price and in english. I guess if you want to look at the bright side of it all the VHS reenforces the nostalgia. If you haven't seen it I recommend that you go over visit your friend who has good taste in movies and borrow it from him.
4,Good idea didn't fit her pan,"I wanted to give her a gift. She peradventure has not enough practice with them yet. Her pan is too deep, therefore the tines need to be bent so she can get it dipped. Didn't work as well as she expected."
1,Poorly Packaged/bad quality,"They came in an envelope and were all bent. The quality is extremely cheap. If I had it to do again, I would not buy these."
3,Read from Cover-to-Cover or Don't read at all!,"This book is just what the title says it is. This is not a book to learn Java from, and it is not a useful reference. It is a book to help the reader understand the mindset behind Java. It makes frequent reference to C++ (which I don't know and don't care about) and contains several multi-page examples that sometimes seem to go on forever.By all means, read this book from cover-to-cover but look elsewhere if you wish to learn Java or want a reference book to help you look-up Java syntax or ""how to"" type examples."
4,not for beginners,The book is absolutely not for beginners but the book is one of my best java books i have never seen. I think the book should be more good examples.
2,Gigantically Bad,"If you like the large-print version of Reader's Digest, then you might be happy with this book and it's gigantic text. Otherwise, I recommend avoiding it. I admit this more of a personal opinion that my other book reviews, because Eckel has written several books and has his own following. However, as I was learning Java this book was not useful to me whatsoever. In any case, a free, electronic version of this book is available on Eckel's website."
2,Disorganised,"I have a background in several computer languages. This book has a lot in it but is very disorganised. You keep reading phrases like ""you'll learn about it in future chapters"". It addresses issues like Garbage collection early on (if you're just trying to learn the syntax, why do you care about this so early in the book?). The example codes are long and tedious-trying to find the example buried in the code can be difficult.Definitely not a beginners book on Java...even if you have other experience. I'm looking for a more concise and simple Java book now..."
2,Sample Code Doesn't Work,"Mr. Eckel gets high marks for his comfortably readable prose. He also gets good marks for examples that -- in reading -- seem to explicate his points. He gets very poor marks, however, for the examples as sample code. After downloading the sample code from his web site, I can't get anything beginning with Chapter 3 to compile. It appears the samples make use of some custom utilities that the compiler can't find. I bought the book to learn Java, but it appears I have to know enough Java to interpret cryptic compiler codes so I can try out the samples. This is unhelpful and very, very frustrating. It also leads me to question the quality of the information in the book despite the clarity of the writing."
1,Not for me...,"I started out with a printed version of Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java 3. After some two hundred pages I decided to put the book down. Why?The biggest problem was the examples. They simple grew longer and longer and contained lots of code that had absolutely nothing to do with what Mr. Eckel attempted to explain. For instance, most examples were provided with code whose only job it was to prove that the program really produced the intended result (""see I was right?""). Not very interesting from an educational point of view.Another problem: Mr. Eckel is afraid of graphics. His book is full of text, but he hardly uses graphics to visualise a topic, thus making the information harder to memorise.The title of the book is somewhat misleading. Mr. Eckel is not thinking in Java at all. Mr. Eckel is thinking in C++ and projects his knowledge on Java. The continuous references to C++ are very annoying for anyone not familiar with that language, such as me."
4,Great except...,"This book was great. I cannot deny that the author seems intensely intelligent, but able to convey his Java knowledge in an understandable way. His examples, though, are freakishly LONG. This, for me at least, made the learning process somewhat labored. Worth the money, though. The book covers a LOT of ground very well."
3,Not for those new to Java,"After reading these reviews on Amazon I got the impression that this book was very good, and that having a background in Visual Basic 6 and PHP, it would be ideal for me as a Java beginner.Luckily I borrowed it from the library first, because that was not the case. The book is boring and I would have been lost if I hadn't already read a bit of Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 days. Also, the examples take too long to understand.My next stop will be Java 2: Beginners Guide by Schildt. Or, Head First Java by Bates."
3,Translating Issue?,"This story does not flow as well as some of Jacq's other work, but that may be less a fault of the story and more the problem of a disappointing translation."
4,Easy-Going Historical Fiction...,"I often find myself mentally escaping to Hatschepsut's Temple and the Valley of the Kings and Queens in reading this book...This is easy-going beach/holiday fiction. His descriptions of how the historical characters looked aren't the quintessence of accuracy, but it is readable nonetheless.If you fancy Egyptology, historical fiction or a just plain easy read, go for this piece. And if you are mystified by this part of the world and trilogies, it makes it even better."
2,dissapointing...,very dissapointing live record. groove? where? ive seen the band live and the singer seems to have little interest in engaging the audience/listener or interacting with the band for that matter. i found most of the performances on the CD stale and even pretentious at times. please forgive my spelling.
1,Inadequate Heat,"I already owned an oil heater that generally looks like this, one that has been very good for a few years, heating a bedroom plus adjoining bathroom. However, this Comfort Zone product that I recently bought is not adequate. I am trying to get it to warm up one room (30DegF outside), but here I sit in a fleece jacket and coat while typing this, and the heater has been in the center of the room for an hour with the dial turned all the way up. I'm not very hot on this heater."
3,"Worked well, but not for long","I bought two of these heaters one year ago, to the month. They worked well, producing heat without being overly hard on the electrical bill, throughout our Maine winter last year, which was a comparatively mild winter. We began using them again a few weeks ago, but one of them quit working yesterday. It was working, and then it wasn't. It doesn't even light up when turned on - and yes, I've checked the electrical socket. In comparison, I have a Lakewood oil-filled heater that I bought more than eleven years ago and, while the wheel assembly has let me down, the heater itself still works great. I am rating it three stars because one of our heaters is still working, although I don't know for how long, and because they do work well as long as they are working. I expect to get more than a year out of it, though."
2,gjskaife,I bought this 2 years ago & use it mainly in our finished basement once in a while. A week ago it quit working. Being an iquisitive type I took it apart to check & found a wire with a resistor in it that is bad. I am going to try to fix it when I find what type it is. There is no information on their site or any type of repair parts. For the price and the short lifespan of this product I give it a low rating. There are other heaters that work a much longer time for the price.
3,average,"I ran my heater nonstop so i admit I was hard on it, but this only lasted a few mnths and now it will not even turn on. I would recommend spending a few dollars more if you are looking for something you will use daily."
4,A good translation,"It seems to be a very good translation from Old English. The notes at the end of the book, show a good erudition and just sense of Literary Theory regarding ancient works. Ezra Pound used to talk about Beowulf and its complexities and Pound was a genius. Beowulf is indeed a difficult and marvelous poem, and for it its translation into English or any other modern language requires a serious linguistical and philological knowledge. This one that is being reviewd is a very good translation. I have several translations of this poem, but I prefer this one. I liked (I compared with the original OE text) the way in which the poem was put into modern English verses. A hard task, let me say. Translator is, no doubts, a scholar in this wonderful, fascination language. He deserves to be praised, because translation is not a joke!"
5,Important Concept,"In this wonderful audio, Dr. Estes treats an important concept--the effect in the psyche of Abandonment. The full extent of the impact of the archetype of Abandonment in the collective unconscious of the American people has yet to fully realized. There's a Stone Child in all of us."
2,"close, but not quite","I was looking for a book that had legends about orphans to which I might relate. This book only has 4 or 5 stories and I had already heard them in some form. I also thought there might be some therapeutic or life management benefit in listening to this book. However, the author merely lists the ""gifts"" (personality tendencies) and describes the emotions of abandoned children, but does little by way of giving ideas for healing oneself or dealing with the ongoing relationships between our relatives and others. The content and gentle delivery might be helpful to those still grieving or those still trying to put their feelings into words; but, it does little for listeners at the next level seeking solutions or strategies."
5,awesome,"This tape is not for the faint at heart. It deals with childhood, friendship and how it effects one as a mature grown up. Don't get discourage after one listen you got to listen to the tape at least three times without interuptions to get anything out of it."
1,Disrespectful and Shameless!,"Make no mistake - if you are a fan of ""Calvin & Hobbes"", this book -er pamphlet - is a attempt to separate you from some of your money. ""Author"" Mabel Barr (there is a distinct possibility that she is not even a real person) swiped the idea (the title) straight from ""Calvin & Hobbes"", and then fabricated a story to accompany it. The publisher is located in Gig Harbor, Washington, and - as another reviewer has noted - most of the positive reviews hail from Gig Harbor or nearby Port Orchard, or otherwise appear to be written by relatives of the publisher. One of the reviewers also runs the ""official"" (it's not) Calvin & Hobbes fan club website - the domain name of which just happens to be registered to the publisher of ""Hamster Huey"". Not coincidentally, most of the actual content on the site relates to the promotion of the book/pamphlet. The entire project, and everything surrounding it is a sham."
1,Funny coincidence,"All but one of the four- and five-star reviews of this 7.5-page ""book"" come from towns within 10 miles of the author's residence.I am surprised that Amazon is falling for this hack's shameful attempt to cash in on someone else's creativity."
1,The whimsy ends at the title,"My five-year-old son loves Calvin and Hobbes. In fact he reads Bill Watterson's anthologies aloud to us at bedtime. We are grateful not only for our son's advanced literary talent, but also that he shares Calvin's (and Watterson's) appreciation for both the ridiculous and the sublime. When we saw a book published with the title of Calvin's favorite bedtime story, we snatched it right up. Alas, we were disappointed by ""Hamster Huey's"" stodgy type, plodding prose, and generally square plot. Astute as ever, my little boy observed that the 'story just seemed to lead up to the Quick Order Form' at the back of the book."
1,A Shameful Ripoff,"My criticisms of this ""book"" are simple. It isn't really a book. It is a pamphlet, 6 1/2 pages, with large print and large illustrations on several pages. It is not hardbound. What it does appear to be is a shameless attempt to co-opt an imaginary book title from ""Calvin and Hobbes"" and make a quick buck for the author. Amazon should be ashamed for carrying this travesty."
1,Disappointing and potentially misleading,"I had hoped that the Hamster Huey story mentioned on Calvin and Hobbes had originated from this book, rather than the other way around.I was disappointed to receive (for $6.95, the price of a regular paperback) a booklet with very few pages and illustrations, with a so-so children's story with (to me) questionable merit.If you want to buy this items because you liked Hamster Huey in Calvin and Hobbes books, I predict you will be disappointed."
4,Not just for Calvin & Hobbes' fans,"You don't need to be a Calvin & Hobbes fan to appreciate the good humor and clever illustrations in ""Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie."" Mabel Barr paints a vivid word picture of our hero's ""most famous adventure"" that will become a family favorite. I plan to save it for my 16 month-old granddaughter. When she learns to read (I'm sure she is a child prodigy), we will have a story for both of us."
1,I'd rather read a North Korean kids story to my kids...,"I bought this on impulse while completing my Calvin and Hobbes collection. Probably the first time I ever bought something on Amazon without looking at the reviews and I paid the price. This 8 page thing is just about the lamest kids story I've ever read to my kids. After one reading they have no interest in hearing it again. They love to read Calvin and Hobbes comics and I thought they would get a kick out of hearing Calvin's favorite bedtime story. According to other belatedly read reviews this book has nothing to do with Calvin and Hobbes. I suspect North Korean kids books about ""Dear Leader"" are more imaginative and better written this piece of crud."
1,terrible and worthless,There's better for your children to read than a terribly written rip-off of Calvin and Hobbes ideas. This was a worthless purchase.
1,Do not buy,"this book wasn't even published until 2004 years after Calvin and Hobbes was finished. The author is trying to rip off Calvin and Hobbes fans. notice that most of the positive reviews in the editoral review are from ""Story tellers"" or organizations based in Washington."
1,Absolutely appalling,"A shameful attempt by the author and publisher to make an unauthorized cash grab off the work of Bill Watterson, and backed up by a fake fan site.Watterson went out of his way throughout his career to never dull the joy of Calvin & Hobbes by allowing it to be marketed and merchandised to death. This woman decided to do just that. She's no better off than the manufacturers of the ""Calvin peeing on stuff"" bumper stickers. Just awful."
2,Slots for shapes are way too narrow!,"My two year old generally has advanced dexterity. But this toy was too hard for him. The holes the shapes fit through are too narrow for your average toddler to easily put them through. My son would get confused when he tried to put the round shape in the round hole and he couldn't easily push it through. He would then grab another piece and try to make it work, getting really frustrated in the process. I (39yr old woman) had to make sure I placed the shape in ""just so"" so it would fit. Pushing the shape through triggers a song (by the shape pressing a button down as it goes through the slot)about the shape or number depending on your setting. I suppose this is why the slots are so narrow. However, the design team needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. It's hard to believe this was ever tested by toddlers."
3,shapes don't fit well...,"My son received this toy as a gift for his first birthday. He loved putting the shapes in through the top of the jar and taking them back out, and loved being able to take the lid on and off. The music is cute, too. However, now that he is a little older (almost 15 months) and ready to really sort the shapes, he gets frustrated trying to fit the correct shapes into their corresponding holes. The shapes are too big for their holes, which makes it a very tight squeeze. In order for me to fit, say, the star shape into the star hole, I have to hold the cookie jar tightly with my other hand and really forcefully push the shape through. There is no way my son could do that on his own, which he finds frustrating. Although I think this toy was a cute idea and is fun to use when just putting shapes in and out the top, I think it really should be redesigned to work better as a shape sorter..."
2,SHAPES DO NOT FIT PROPERLY,"My kids both like this toy putting the shapes in and out of the top but I have the same problem as the other reviewer,,,the shapes on mine are WAY too tight to fit thru the shaped holes easily. It is hard for me to do and unless they are lined up exactly it will not work at all. Impossible for any toddler to do. Maybe this issue is not on all of them as other people do not seem to have the problem but overall I am VERY disappointed and will probably be donating this toy to good will next time I go! Fisher Price usually makes good toys but this one in my opinion is not."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","My 3 month old son got this for a Christmas gift and I was shocked to find my 3 year old daughter struggles with it. While it says it's for 6 month to 3 year olds, the shapes are too large to fit in the holes (specifically the triangle and star). I thought it was odd that my 3 year old couldn't do it so I attempted and had the same issue. You literally have to find the perfect angle to have the shape fit. Also, once you put the lid on the top of the jar, there's no way a child would be able to remove it. I found this frustrating as my 3 year old asked me repeatedly to open it for her. Had I purchased the gift myself I would return it. Since it's a gift, i'll let it collect dust in the off chance one of the kids will use it again. Don't waste your time."
3,Too repetitive,"My 21-month-old has been playing with this for months and he doesn't have any trouble getting the shapes into their holes. It can sometimes be difficult to get a shape all the way into the jar if the other shapes are already in there. However, what bugs me about this toy is the reward system. If you get the correct shape, the toy says the name of the shape. If you put anything in through the lid area, it sings a song for you. It seems to be encouraging the child to use the large hole rather than the correctly shaped holes. It also sings when you insert your hand or dump the cookies on the floor. At this point I could sing that song in my sleep. It's not a bad sorting toy (my son definitely prefers it to Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks) but the educational part leaves something to be desired."
5,A go to Laugh & Learn!,We bought this about 4 years ago for our oldest.. we still have it in the toy box and my 18 month old loves it. It also was a great hit for my now 3 1/2 year old son. It lasted great through all three kids and even at almost 5 years old my daughter likes to play with it.We never had any problems with shapes not fitting right.
2,Entertaining - not easy to insert shapes,"We bought this for my daughter on her first birthday. She loved the songs and sounds (my only reason for 2 stars), but since there's only two songs they got to be incredibly redundant. The toy announces the shape as it's inserted, and will sing about numbers which is educational. The worst feature is the curved exterior. It is so difficult for little hands to insert the shapes. Even as adults we had a difficult time. We ended up donating the toy, it wasn't worth the annoyance and didn't perform it's intended purpose."
2,holes too small for shapes,"I bought this becasue my son loves his Fishbowl ( I think it's Fisher Price) and this is kind of the same idea with a container for things to go in and sounds when you drop things in/take them out, but I was very dissapointed that the shapes are really hard to get through their holes. Then, even if you can squeeze them through, once you get a few shapes in the jar you can't get the rest of the shapes though their holes becase the holes are at the very bottom and the shapes inside take up too much room to fit new ones in. It's cute if you just want to use it with the top hole, but the shape sorter holes weren't very well designed."
4,Kids love this thing!,"We have purchased this toy for at least three children including our own. She is 1 and loves the noises and putting the pieces in the jar, as well as making noise with the top of the cookie jar anywhere she can! I recommend this for a 6mos old and above."
3,Not worth it...,"This toys is cute and something a little different, but you baby has to be a bit older to use it properly. The whole idea of the cookie jar is cute. The jar can be used for storage and sings cute little songs. However, tyhe shapes just barely fit through the holes. My boys are not strong enough to push the blocks through the hole. When most of the shapes are in the jar (it's almost full) you can't get the last shape into the jar well... even I struggle with getting it in."
2,Shapes Don't Fit Easily or Well,"My 18 month old daughter received this as a gift and within minutes I knew it was a mistake. First of all, the shapes are on the side of the cookie jar, which make it difficult for her to put the shapes in. She would have to turn the jar at an angle to get the shape in. Also, the shapes just barely fit in the holes and you have to give it a good shove to get it in. Even I found it difficult. Plus, there's a button that gets pushed down when the shape goes in, which give it more resistance. The cookie jar shape sorter is going back, and we're in the market for a good old-fashioned wooden cube shape sorter. Suprised at Fisher Price making such a difficult toy and marketing it to toddlers."
4,"Great sound! Check out ""The Time Being.""","Sometimes I'm wary of CDs from obscure 1960s pop/psychedelic groups. Often they claim to be remastered, but they're simply digitized versions of the best-sounding vinyl copy that some collector could find (although this situation didn't hurt the Mindrocker series).However, this CD sounds great! There's a lot of good pop on here, but I think the Doors-inspired extended jam cut ""The Time Being"" is the best. But there's something for everyone on this CD.I only wish there was some information about the band. No liner notes. No discography. No band bio. It's a solid but undistinguished rerelease of a rare 60s group. Still, I'm glad it's out there at all."
4,Boston Tea Party - self-titled (Mason Records),"Originally released in 1968, as this was the obscure band's only record. Best described as psychedelic pop. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing [for the first time] ""I Found A Way"", the should-have-been a major hit ""We Have Already Died"", the happening ""Just Pretend You're Sherry"", the six-minute (CD reissue's lengthiest track) ""The Time Being"" [maybe inspired by the Doors to some extent?] and ""Please Be Glad (For What You Have In Your Heart)"". Line-up: Travis Fields - lead vocals, Mike Stevens - guitar, Richard DePerna - bass, Robert DePerna - organ and Dave Novogroski - drums. Recommended for fans of Yellow Balloon, The Move, Human Beinz and (maybe) Tomorrow."
4,Very Tight,"The quality of these Gaiters are great. Stitching, zippers and hooks up front to attach to the laces. All great! Except it's very tight, feels like it's made for a kid. Turns out mine is a Medium, but the Large is only taller, not wider. I'm a male 5'-11"", 190lbs, and my legs are normal sized.Zipping these up is pretty tough. Once on, all is good. It stays put and no snow goes past the bottom."
3,well written but needs another update,"Very well written, but could use more pop culture movies as well as more recent ones. I was really surprised when several people were discussing whether the Brooklyn or Manhattan bridge appeared in Saturday Night Fever and I had no idea."
2,"Forrest IS Koontz, and the writing proves it","Just to end the confusion, Forrest is one of Dean Koontz's pen names! Too many of these books seem like left over manuscripts, though. And he doesn't want people to know it's him, yet at the very top of every book it says, ""'I hope EF becomes a household name as she deserves to be' -- Dean Koontz."" He wants them to sell like Leigh Nicoles did, I guess. But this tale is too much like others I've read by better authors.."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ONE FOR WENDY,"This is the 2nd book i've read by Wendy Corsi Staub...She's a super author who keeps you guessing til the last page....Just when you think you have it figured out, she throws you a curve...great read...I'm already into the 3rd book, Fade to Black....another page turner...The Mary Higgens clark of the Millenium (if not better)..."
4,All The Way Home,"Excellent ""who done it"" mystery. Keeps you guessing until the end. This was out monthly feature for the Boyertown Book Club and got a 4.5 star rating from the club."
2,Not one of her better ones,"I have read a few of her books, enjoying all of them. This one drug on alittle long before there was much action. The ending was abit too ridiculous for me. I will keep reading her books, I just didn't feel this was one of her better more exciting stories."
2,"A dopey, convuluted plot written for Nancy Drew readers","Rory, the central character here, is a recent graduate of Cal Berkeley. Based on this book, she is probably the most gullible, guileless graduate of that august institution. Her italicized musings (everyone in the book thinks in italics when they are having deep, disturbing thoughts--that takes up half the book it seems) are those of a 13 year old girl. Nothing against 13 year old girls, but everyone in the book, except one character is way over 13, but that is the depth and maturity of their musings. The plot is incredibly convuluted and there are some things at the end that defy belief. Not recommended for anyone over 13."
5,"Wonderful content, fair binding","By reading this work, one sits at the feet of a great man of faith. Gregory of Nyssa is one of the great witnesses who have gone before us, helping to show the way for all who will follow. I highly recommend reading this edition of his works, alongside the works of the other church Fathers and Mothers. You get a delightful taste of Gregory's work as well as that of his sister Macrina, who he often simply calls ""the Teacher.""The text provides a brief introduction and pseduo-summary to each of Gregory's treatises. The introductions are mostly fair, but they are not intended as a critical analysis. Callahan's translation is extremely readable, if not slightly dated.I considered rating this book 4 stars instead of 5 because of the binding. It is not my favorite ""feel"" of a paperback. The binding is definitely worth the reduced price of a paperback so I decided on 5 stars. I have abused the book a little during my study and it seems to have survived fairly well."
5,Such a good bible.,This is such a good bible. My daughter loves it. Highly recommend it for elementary students. Very satisfied with quality of product and seller service.
2,false prophet of my youth,"This was one of the most influential books ofmy youth in the 60s. I accepted it as truth.The alleged success of Edgar Cayce's remotehealing led me to accept his other claims aboutthe mystical nature of human life, reincarnation,etc. The book made many specific predictionsabout future geological and political events forthe crucial years 1958 to 1998. Alas, as I rereadmy old copy of this book, none of the predictionshave come to pass. I am forced to conclude thatEdgar Cayce was not at all omniscient, was infact just another human with no pipeline to universal knowledge. I have no further reason to accept his statements about the nature of life and death. In fact, I have become a total skeptic on all things mystical. It will be interesting to me to see how the total failure of all the specific predictions is treated in a new edition of the book, I imagine there is a lot of tortured logic. Anyway, I gave him a 30 year test and he failed."
3,"Very Puzzling life and book, successful cures from trance?","Although there is impressive testimony that many of Edgar Cayce's medical treatments proved to be successful, and are still used today, in one form or another, it boggles the scientific mind to be able to accept that such cures were imparted to Mr. Cayce through a trance like state of sleep and that during his waking hours he had no knowledge of the meaning or methods of his prescribed cures.There is much mumbo jumbo in the book, involved with trying to explain the meaning of his various predictions about the changes to take place in the world. Due to the vagueness of most of his predictions, one could pick a year and find some thing to apply it to to prove that he had great powers. His greatest supporters in today's world would seem to be the osteopaths who have successfully used his prescriptions and natural alternative treatments to help ailing patients. Would be interesting to hear a report from their view!"
4,This is a great introduction to a great man. Unforgettable!,"Jess Stearn's style of writing may tend to be a tad sensationalistic, but he certainly makes you think. Especially now that it is l998, reading Ch. 3 on earth changes can be a bit chilling. I love the book because it set me on the spiritual path with both feet. Edgar Cayce, the greatest prophet of our century, the Father of Wholistic Medicine and simple man with a great heart and a cosmic mind, will be a truly ""real character"" for you, by the time you finish this remarkable book. Thanks Jess for making him so accessible!"
5,There's more here than prophesy,"The story of Edgar Cayce and other people with parapsychological ability is a most compelling and interesting phenomenon of mental capacity. That some people have this type of psychic ability demonstrates the vast power and perception of the human mind that warrants investigation. That this type of phenomena doesn't necessarily ""fit"" into mainstream psychological study causes severe conflict with generally accepted mainstream beliefs about the workings of the mind. As a consequence, the field of orthodox study tends to put people like Cayce into the catagory of fakes and charletans, at worst, and to ignore them at best. The study of this type of psychic phenomenon would go far in explaining the unknown regions of the mind. Scientific discovery necessitates following examples that are exceptions to the general rule. People with parapsychological powers ala Cayce provide great opportunity to track the great uncharted regions of the human psyche."
4,Interesting!,"This was a very, very interesting read. I caught a Cayce special on A&E; and became interested. After looking around, this book seemed to contain the most information. It's a great collection from early life until death and even contains some medical readings and advice.I will admit that going back and trying to find something is very difficult b/c the chapters are long and there is no index. For more specific medical advice and categorizing I bought The Edgar Cayce Encylcopedia of Healing."
3,Second album is definitely the better one,"An obscure one hit wonder in 1989-90 with the title track from this album, Tyler Collins (born September 1st, 1966 in Harlem) is a cute and fairly talented if not hugely distinctive singer, but both the dance tunes and slow ballads on this album are a bit lacking in creativity. Her 1992 album, ""Tyler,"" has considerably stronger material and a bit more of an edge, though it's restrained enough to the point that she's still her likeable self. The midtempo ""Second Chance"" and the duet with Grady Harrell ""You And Me,"" are decent if not outstanding selections from this album."
1,Not worth $20,"The book is only 50 pages so I did not expect much, but $20 is expensive for the minimal information in the book. The author does tell you how to read option price codes and the basics of how options are priced. However, the author makes light of any risks in options trading. The author's basic message is a pep talk to trade options. The book has $5.00 worth of information. If you can buy it used for that price, buy it unless you already know the basics from your broker or a dozen other websites."
5,What A Great CD!!!!,I saw these guys Live and bought their CD. I've been listening to it ever since. Very addictive stuff with Roots Rock/Pop flavorings of Van Morrison and the Stones!
1,Defective,I ordered this DVD to show to my students at school. The first copy played 3 times in the VCR and then wouldn't play again. I sent it back to Amazon who sent me another copy. The new one wouldn't play at all! I give up!!
5,Crime and perdition,"I love crime novels, and this is a great one. Mr. Overby is Falling is in the tradition of the work of Jim Thompson. It is a smart, violent, lurid tale told graphically. It is the story of two crazy killers who team up to terrify a city. It is also about the terrible way the world works.This book will stay with you a long time after you read it. You will be thinking about Overby and Walter for days. You may even find yourself dreaming about them. If you do, hope that you wake up quickly!A great book!"
3,Good Start,"This book is short, easy to read and very entertaining. It is a nice start from a first book writer and shows tremendous amounts of potential for future work. However, Tyree blatantly rips off several authors and other pieces of work. I would bet money the author has read Fight Club (and other Chuck Palahniuk books) several times and has no qualms not only stealing the themes and basic storyline, but the style in which the book is written. Most all art borrows and even copies from a piece that inspired it, but Tyree seems to take that premise too far. Other than that a good start from a new author."
2,Does not hold up,Bought this product a year ago and it worked well . The company must have changed manufactures because used on the same application it loosens up and falls apart right away.
2,Didn't work for me.,"Bought to wrap a/c clutch wire in car engine.Had absolutely no adhesive property, at all. Paper stuck together via static electricity sticks better, in other words.Also, this didn't come in a 'roll'. It came like you might fold a belt... and 3 feet of this really isn't much, at all.All around, was disappointed. It's possible, though, that my complaints are user error."
3,"Great bargain, but losing texture","I loved the color and feel of this cover, but am noticing a couple flaws as is is starting to produce small tears and the fabric is beginning to pillow slightly. Overall I'm happy with it, and it really is a bargain at this price. The size feels a little too large for my spread, but that may be due to its age and the body/feathers have lost much of their fullness."
2,What you'd expect for the money,"Well, it's a cheap duvet and that's what you get. It is much darker than the picture, like a slate gray. Also, it balled up after I washed it the first time even though I followed the instructions. And it really isn't that soft, so I really cannot recommend this product and have returned it."
5,a Must Read for truthseekers,"For those seeking the truth, Gaebeleins volumes are at the top of the list. The granduer, beauty, and depth of theGospel of the King will overwhelm the reader with its depth! One of Gaebeleins best!"
4,Really like it!,I purchased this because of the comments of others. I find that it is heavy so it stays on the counter when I pull off a paper towel. Love the chicken topper because it gives me something to hold onto when pulling the paper towel. Love the surface on the unit - very easy to clean. Only negative is that in replacing the paper towels sometimes the chicken topper is a bit hard to remove and the rest of the rod underneath ends up turning too. A bit awkward. Other than that I really like it.
2,It's ok. Color much lighter than pic. Rec'd slightly damaged,"The item is a much lighter blue than in the pic. Immediately upon unwrapping I had to tighten the screws in the bottom. The smaller arm still is loose, there are two chips in the ceramic. The only reason I am not returning it is because I'm lazy, it really is heavy and you can rip off paper towels with one hand. Its ok but it just seemed like it was used and not new."
4,Beverly Hills Supper Club Fire,"This is not just an excellent telling of the tragic fire, it is also a loving tribute to the memory of the BHSC as told by someone who grew up working there."
4,A precise account of the Beverly Hills Supper Club Fire,"This book is a must read for those of us that never really knew the exact time line of events that happened before, during and after the fire. Wayne Dammert, mythotically takes you through the truth and occurrences of the fire. This book answered a lot of mysteries I had about my parents who perished in the fire. Thank you Wayne for all your tenacious work to keep our loved ones memories alive. K.M. Brown"
3,Interesting...but,"As a disaster book fan, I was anxious to read a first person account of this deadly fire which, unlike most modern fires, killed a large number of people. The portion of the book devoted to the fire is alright, but spotty since it is, essentially, one man's recollections. I would have appreciated an overview. This did come later in the book during the inquiries but, by then, it had lost its dramatic impact. I also got a little tired of the narrator who, although happily married, seems to consider himself something of a babe magnet. Really, who cares?"
5,Excellent book on events at BHSC and its history,"The book provides an excellent resource for the history of the Beverly Hills Supper Club and the fire on May 28, 1977.The author provides useful floor plans that help shows the lack of exits throughout the building. The book includes many photos from the Supper Club along with employees and guests, etc.The ""Other Voices"" chapter has many disturbing stories (especially Bruce Rath) from those who somehow survived the fire or from police, firemen, etc.After reading this book I am more aware of fire exits whenever I am in a crowded building."
5,learning automata,"I'm just trying to learn to make automata. I find this book the best that I've found so far, for beginning to understand the complexities of gears, cams and levers used in making automata."
5,Brightened my day,Incredibly difficult CD to find in Sweden (Tekla is from Sweden anyway)So I was glad to find this disc
3,Not all there,"I saw this film on Animal Planet several times and loved it so I was excited to find it on DVD. However I was very disappointed that the company distributing the DVD chose to leave several very important scenes with Gordon Tootoosis. As he is portrayed as a Native American medicine man and I can only guess that the distributor is Christian based, they chose to leave out the scenes with Gordon journeying to find the young girl and then later changing into a bear himself. They were wonderful scenes and since I'm also a big fan of Tootoosis I was stunned that they would cut out the scenes. I probably would not have bought the DVD had I known this. A big disappointment to an otherwise very good film."
3,"Good Story, Weak Acting","This movie actually has a good story. It has an environmental conscious message and the scenery is very beautiful. Its main flaw is that the acting is not very good at all. Many of the lines are beyond predictable and delivered so unfeelingly. The best actor in the entire movie is the bear, named ""Masha"". Towards the end, there's a scene where I was just about to cry when I got worried about what might happen to the bear."
2,Not for beginners,"The writing style of Mr. Heller is very engaging and makes the text fun to read. But there are several flaws in his approach. I used his book for an Intro to C++ college course and soon had to run out to a store for another book to complete my assignments. This book starts out nicely but before you know it, he is talking multi-file programs and complicated class header files, etc. This book might be suitable to someone who already knows C and whats to learn C++. Too many basic concepts are left out. One example is structures which will help in the understanding of classes. Finally, the comical chapter titles are fun to read but make it difficult to find again, material for reviewing later on. A title that might be better is by Robert LaFore -OOP in C++."
3,Introduction to C++,I found this book exactly the same as all the other guides.Very good to start with then what the hell happend? Did I miss 2 chapters.Lately I have read quite a few guides and found them all the same. I always get the feeling I've missed something. Please can anyone suggest a book for the people who like to go on at a steady pace to understand C++.Thanks
5,Excellent book for a C++ novice!,The book is well written and quite unique. A best buy! There is one thing which bothers me a little -- the book does not include a very important topic: templates
1,A compete Scam !! should rate a minus 5 stars !,"I ordered the Sony Info-Lithium NPF960 battery but was sent a faux product. It is not Sony, nor is it Info-Lithium . Its a totally bogus li-ion (no mfr name is even on the battery). It does not work properly with my Sony Camcoder (no battery life monitor, etc). I wrote and asked the company to send me the Sony battery that I ordered from their Amazon ad, and was advised that the best they could do is a refund. so i'm returning the battery to them...the Sony ad isnt just misleading, its downright bogus !! Beware !!"
3,Coulda been a contenda!!,"I liked this book, but I didn't love it. Blaylock could have made it much scarier if he put more focus on Argyle and all the demonic/golem/black magic stuff and less on Uncle Henry and the doughnut shop, etc... Took me a little longer than usual to finish this one."
2,Not up to snuff,"As a fan and regular reader of Blaylock, I was a little disppointed by this book. It does a good job of being scary at times, but fails to enchant like ""The Paper Grail"" or to amuse like ""The Last Coin.""A disturbing trend I've noticed in this book is that Blaylock writes about himself; he is the main character in all his books. While this approach was tolerable the first few times, it's getting a little old."
5,Just Great,This is a wonderful yet sad story. This is one of my favorites by Lurlene. Its just Beauifully written. Love it.
4,bittersweet story,"Some parts of this book were excellent. I loved the whole story, until I got to the epolouge. Why did Jason have to die? And why is Darcey living in the mountains? Although the epolouge isn't the best, and the story is rather predictable (mom dies, Jason liked Darcey all along, Connors would develop) it was an all in all good book. I would recomend it to anyone who wants to know Lurlene a little bit more."
5,Regional Masterpiece,"If you want to learn about the flora and fauna of the PNW, start with the trees and in particular with this book. It is peerless among Northwest nature books--interesting to read and full of black and white drawings of the highest quality. You will quickly find yourself able to identify all of the native and naturalized trees."
1,Wrong Part,Whoever writes the description fails to specify front or rear. My search was for front pads and it led me to the pads which turn out to be rear but was not identified as such. This is why I am hesitant to order on line.
5,Awesome and motivatintg. Don't run a marathon without it.,I am running the NYC Marathon in November 99 and I picked up this book for a little motivation. I read the introduction in the bookstore and started to cry. I loved it. I lost the book during a trip to California. I wasted no time in ordering another copy. I am ready to run now that I shared with all of the poeple who told their story.
5,Will Power,"The different stories show how common people took up running. There is wide range of marathon finishers and therefore it is easy to find somebody in the book you can relate too.What this book does best is inspire those who contemplate running a marathon. I took up running a few months ago, slowly building up my mileage. The incredible stories in the book show me that indeed it is possible to run 26.2 miles, or even more for ultramarathons. At one point it becomes a matter of mind over matter. Beyong running, this book is about the incredible abilities that lie within each one of us if we give ourselves the right training and believe we can achieve what we've decided to do."
3,"Interesting reading, but gets monotonous","Interesting book for the first time reader. Not something that you will pick up and read over and over. As you get through several stories they actually get a little monotonous but it is still an interesting read. If you don't have to spend the money and can get it at the library, I would recommend that first.Also, the dates of some of these runners stories are quite aged. Much of the book is like a history lesson where marathon running has come from over the past 70 years. Again interesting, but didn't do much for me."
4,Good lessons and motivation for a monster marathon,"It's an easy book to read. Several stories you can select and read at your own pace. That's important because you might be bored by the repetition (and that's why I don't put 5 stars). However, it demystifies this monster: the marathon. The stories are written by people like all of us, not experts, not professional runners, of various ages. These made it ! So the message is why not you too ? In many cases, they provide information about what they did good and bad. Overall, good book."
3,Good idea..bad examples,"As someone who literally put my blood, sweat and tears into training for my first marathon, I was almost offended by the numerous stories of people who just decided to run, with little or no training. Kind of like not paying your dues. There were several examples in which people downplayed the seriousness of this undertaking. Sure, they paid for it with tough marathons, but that is besides the point. I bought this book to read on the plane on my way to my first marathon. It so discouraged me and trivialized my efforts that I didn't feel like what I was doing was such an accomplishment after all. I ended up leaving the book on the plane and trying to forget about the ease at which some of these people decided to run 26.2 miles."
4,Inspiring for FIrst-Time Marathoners!,"I enjoyed reading the different points of view about first marathon experiences. I liked the variation between novice and elite runners. There were some common threads, but other things were different about the experiences. Sometimes the writing (or editing?) seemed a little choppy, but it didn't distract me too much, since it's a subject of high interest to me. I'm thinking about rereading it, now that I've actually signed up for a marathon."
5,Strong Arguments,"Nasty, incisive polemic on the insidiousness of the State, whose nature changed over the years. The State is essentially an anti-social entity which provides the political means for a faction or factions to enrich themselves at the expense of others. All sorts of eye-opening arguments here, including a reexamination of American history. Astute criticisms that you don't always understand fully until you read them again and begin to ""absorb"" them."
4,The true enemy explained,"In this day of ever increasing government power both in the US and elsewhere, A. Nock's book is more relevant than ever. Written in 1935 at the height of FDR's new deal and with fascist and communist running most of the world stage, Nock explains why the notion of Big Government is a threat to freedom and the individual very life. The only reason I cannot give this book 5 stars is that the print is too large for a comfortable read. But since the message is so important, that can be overlooked and thus I strongly recommend anyone interested in liberty to pick up this now classic book."
2,"Good Principles, Bad History","To begin with, Nock makes an eloquent case for natural rights liberty and the criminality of the state. His principles are wonderful, but his historical analysis is horrible. He bases most of it off the perverted works of ""Progressive"" historians, among them Charles A. Beard, whose ""Economic Origins"" serves as the main basis of his commentary on the Constitution. Together with his mistaken history, he also devolopes a misleading and destructive form of social class theory. Despite this, the last chapter and essay in the appendix serve to redeem the book somewhat. I would recommend the work as a source of strong libertarian principles and a solid indictment of the state( remember the difference between the state and government). However, I would suggest that you might wish to supplement Nock's falacious historical view with those of historians as BernardBailyn, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, Carl Bridenbaugh, and Forrest McDonald for a true analysis."
2,Just plain bad.,"Like most libertarian works, Nock's work brims with an absolute contempt for democracy, a total cynicism towards the possibility of altruistic virtues and governance, exaggerated rhetoric, faulty history, and incoherent moral theory. He calls Roosevelt's democratic election in 1932 a ""coup d'etat"" , refers to the working class voting in favor of redestributive programs as ""subsidized voting power"", makes a totally incoherent distinction between government and state, and glosses over the role of the public sector's in any faction of the current order that he approves of. Also, he ought to heed Bentham's description of natural rights: ""Nonsense on Stilts."" Not recommended."
4,"Gorgeous photographs, interesting text","The text relates the history of the Blue Ridge Parkway, from initial conception through to completion, which actually didn't happen until 1983 with the opening of the Linn Cove Viaduct. That is interesting enough, but the real merits of this book are in the gorgeous photographs, which stretch all along the length of the Parkway and cover all seasons and moods. Organized in milepost order, they brought back fond memories of the places I've visited (Peaks of Otter, Mabry Mill) and hopes to visit all the rest someday."
3,Mouse-to-cradle connection flaw,"Except for the recharging issue, I have no complaint with this mouse. If you just set the mouse down in the cradle, the recharging light blinks a couple times and then stops. The mouse doesn't sit exactly right in order for the two electrical plates in the mouse body to line up correctly with the electrical prongs in the cradle. In order to get it to fully recharge, I have to hold it steady until the recharging light flashes consistently, then I have to wedge a paper clip between the cradle and the mouse to make sure the mouse doesn't slip down and break the connection."
5,Perfection is hard to find; this CD offers it!,"I certainly can't top the reviewer from Northampton, who so eloquently expressed what the Comedian Harmonists are about. But I do want to add that these are tight vocals, very seamless, smoothly melodious. (I'm not sure how the Elmer Fudd image came to Matt the reviewer, above, but it certainly couldn't have been from the SOUND of the Harmonists: overall, these guys are silk.) Also, the pianist that accompanies them has a deft way of supporting the vocals without overwhelming them or becoming underwhelming himself. It's a balancing act of pure magic. The Hannibal CD has superb sound quality (considering the age of these recordings)--it really sparkles--and great selections. This is music you can listen to when you're happy, when you're sad, when you want to do a little two-step for the heck of it, when you want to think. It's versatile. It's perfect. And, as the reviewer from Northampton said, it's sublime."
5,YOU GOTTA HEAR IT!!!!,"Sui generis is right!!! Six voices that blend so harmoniously - it's a joy to hear!!! Regretablly, the group broke up because some members were Jewish and migrated before Hitler's policies were enforced throughout Germany. Interestingly enough, the last surviving member of the group, Roman Cycowski, died about two years ago, and was the oldest living cantor in the U.S. at the time of his death. One can only speculate about the group's popularity and influence if allowed to remain together."
5,"A Soothing, Thoughtful Joy to Read","From the moment I started reading Yearning for the Wind, I felt the tug of my Irish heritage, and settled in to enjoy a renewal of faith with Mother Nature. Tom Cowan's gentle words blends historical legends and myths with the natural yearnings of our own bodies and souls to be united with the world around us. He puts the pieces of the puzzle together and does it in a magical way with excellent writing skills."
5,An absolutely wonderful little book,"This book is a true delight! Full of the light and magic of the world all around us, Tom Cowan's words are sure to make you think and to move your soul."
2,Not what I expected,"Despite the author's intentions in writing this book, it's more that evident that he feels it is justified for minorities to carry around a huge chip on their shoulders for passed wrong doings by whites, in particular Native Americans. In direct contradiction to the book, that we should all live in peace and harmony with the earth and each other, their is an undercurrent of resentment by the author, which contaminates the intent of the book."
1,drowned hamster,"My hamster was able to get up & chew intot he bottom of hte bottle, resulting in a mini-flood that left him & cage & all... drenched. OOPS!"
2,temporary fix,"I got black one to fix 4 small tears in a nylon down vest. It's very easy to use, applies nicely, smooth, lightweight, matched vest perfectly. I wanted to give it 5 stars until now. I just noticed that the tape is coming off around the edges and on some corners from the center to end (I did round them up and left enough space between the tear and tape edges). The vest was hanging in the closet all the time since repair, I did not wash it, and weather conditions were great, it doesn't rain very often in our closet... The tape does not hold to the surface very well. It sticks good and beautifully at first, but it looks like you will have to check and re-stick it constantly. The good thing is it's very easy to remove without ruining the fabric, there are no glue spots or sticky stuff afterwards."
5,Weekend and Summer jazz at its best,"This CD has been the mainstay for my jazz collection for many years. My girls are now grown up and after having lost my original Jazz for a Lazy Day cd, I just ordered a new one and my youngest (now graduating high school) came over for a night of online game playing. The next morning - which coincided with my having just received the new copy of this CD - I turned this on and she instantly lit up and said she remembered this CD her entire childhood and it made her smile because it meant it was Saturday and life was good. That sums it up - put this CD in and it tells the world - life is good..."
4,Good Book,"The book is easy reading and covers many topics. The ""in brief"" may be good for many meetings, but for major meetings the ""non-in brief"" addition is normally the book that is used."
3,"Good, but there are better summary versions of Robert's Rules","This book was good as a way to get started in becoming familiar with Robert's Rules. However, a better introductory guide is Robert's Rules in Plain English. If you are new to Robert's Rules, my suggestion is get the Plain English book and read it cover to cover. It's short and will tell you 95% of what you'll probably need to know. If you need any further details, then you should move on to the full version of Robert's Rules. In my opinion, this book (...In Brief) is a little more dry and with lower quality examples than ""Plain English."""
4,Easier than full edition,"This isn't your average book for entertaining reading, but it gives a much more succinct ""Roger's Rules"" reference book than the full edition. This is much more ideal for lower level meetings, such as local clubs, church organizations, etc. It's a valuable resource that's easier to read and yet contains the basics needed to run successful meetings efficiently."
4,"Never get pushed around in a meeting, again.","This is a good, easy to use reference on Roberts Rules of Order. As our formal education stops preparing people to participate in a democratic meeting, some people think they can throw around terms and claim it is Roberts Rules of Order they are relying upon. I have served on several non-profit boards which claim to operate under Roberts, and find this book very helpful to break the log jams and game-playing some people try to use the name of ""Roberts"" to get their way in meetings."
4,Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief,"This is a good reference to have on your e-tablet for quick reference on the go or at a meeting. It is especially helpful when there is some disagreement over procedure. This newly revised ""brief edition"" from Amazon.com is handy for checking on the latest changes."
5,A very nice informative book,A book I donated to an organization that needed guidance with their meetings. Very useful.
5,NIce cheat sheet,"Especially helpful when introducing people to official procedures and its an incredible quick reference guide for the ""senior moments""if you know what I mean."
4,Roberts Rule of Order,I was very pleased with the updated version of the Roberts Rule of Order. The book gives very observatorial information on conducting any meeting or setting with order. It has improved eminently through the years when I first had the time to peruse the book.
3,A little too basic...,"I found this book to be a little too basic...it's perfect for someone who knows nothing about Robert's Rules of Order...but if you have a little knowledge, then the book is simplistic."
3,You can't stop here!,"There appear to be any number of authors who feel the need to improve on and elaborate on the very clear and precise original in the field of Robert's rules. Get one if you feel you need it, but get the real thing as well. Robert's Rules, latest edition, preferably in the library-bound edition, is the one you'll be taking to your next meeting of your condo association."
4,Necessary for organized meetings,This comes to every church council meeting. It's like having a parliamentarian in the room - it is useful if necessary.
4,Easy to use,Still the same but much easier to read and put into practice. This new layout will help to move many meetings and decisions. JBF
3,It's OK,"As a quick ref, this is well written and easy to understand.But if challenging how an organization is run....I found I neededthe full edition."
5,Informative,I purchased this book to provide guidance and order for my Motorcycle Club meetings and to help provide some insight to making by laws for the club. It has everything you need to know and more. Very plain and easy to read and understand.
5,Roberts Rule of Order,"I love the little book, it is small enough tht a I can carry in my purse. Has all the information you need to carry on a meeting. I recommend this for every president or any one who conducts meetings.B Richard"
5,Robert's Rules of Order in Brief,The book gives a quick and easy methods of conducting meetings using parliamentary precedures. This book is much easier to read and understand than the previous versions and has allowed us to begin using the correct meeting procedures immediately. The majority of our attendees have purchased this low cost version and bring it to meetings with them. Great Buy!
4,Good briefing.,"It was good to have this consolidated brief of Roberts Rules (which, as you know can be overwhelming at times). I carry it with me all the time when I have to attend meetings. It comes in really handy."
5,Meetings Bible,This is the only guide to meetings you need. The brief version is great so you don't have to wade through pages of information. I have found it to be invaluable in planning for meetings and running them. Well worth it.
5,Makes life easier if you are running meetings,"I bought this book after I became president-elect of an academic society. I love working with my colleagues, but we constantly argue. RRNR In Brief helped me keep meetings on track, expedited much of the work we needed to accomplish, and helped reassure the Board and Committee chairs that we were moving in the right direction when someone asked: ""Can we do this?"". Just before my term as president began, I made sure that everyone serving on the Board of Directors had their own copy, that way I could refer to specific pages during email and face-to-face meetings. The book is concise (easy to read on a plane or in the bathroom - sorry TMI!), clearly written, and covered everything I needed to know during my term. I recommend it to anyone serving as a Board member or Committee chair."
4,Light Hearted Fun,"Buster Poindexter is certainly long on personality. He even has a little bit of talent as well. If you are looking for a light hearted party record, this one will fit your bill. Hit The Road Jack, Who Put The Whiskey In The Well and International Playboy are my three faves on here but the rest is pretty charming if nothing else.More of a novelty CD than anything else. However, it will give you a chuckle."
3,Do you wanna go berserk?,"Buster Poindexter was the lounge singer persona of former New York Doll David Johansen. He had a hit with ""Hot Hot Hot"", which isn't on this album. The best know song here is his cover version of Ray Charles' ""Hit the Road, Jack"", which was featured in that movie about escaped mental patients starring Michael Keaton. This is a decent album, but nothing spectacular. The whole album feels rather artificial, like the whole ""Buster Poindexter"" persona is a put-on(which it was)."
3,Johnny Suede,"Looking at Buster's hair I am reminded of the Brad Pitt movie ""Johnny Suede"". The music on this album is great but the limit of material makes me suspect that in was a rushed product in order to capitalize on the success of ""Hot, Hot, Hot"". The main thing that dates this album is the fact that it has musicians on it, which seem to be an endagered species in the age of sampling in order to steal the perfect beat.There are a few downer songs on this album (""Poorest People"") but it does have a good party vibe."
3,Amazing Transformation,"It's totally amazing that this is the same David Johansen that I just saw in the New York Dolls. They don't even look alike! This is the music that you would expect to hear on a cruise ship or Las Vegas except it's pretty good. This CD is mixture of Latin, gospel, ballads and party music...it starts off strong, but overall it's hit and miss. He has a 14 piece band behind him which Buster calls the Banshees of Blues. The one big cover is ""Hit the Road Jack"" which I never realized was originally a Curtis Mayfield song. I always thought it was created by Ray Charles."
3,Wolfsbane leaves you waiting for the next book,"I enjoy reading Mr. Johnstone's work, especially those in the horror genre. While ""Wolfsbane"" is not the best example of his work, it certainly isn't the worst either. My main complaint is that the ending leaves you waiting for the next installment in a series that never comes. This doesn't keep you from enjoying the book, but it does disappoint you somewhat at the end."
3,The Movie was Better,"After Reading this book, and listening to the Movie, I think that he needs to do A little more movie watching."
5,A very special tribute from a loving daughter.,Lisa has done a beautiful work with recipes of Moms who have succumb to breast cancer. The love and care she put into this book is very evident. I love it! I am so touched that she took the time and great effort to accomplish this very special book.For me it is a special keepsake for my children. It has recipes from both there grandmothers (Kathleen Zinkgraf and Sylvia Poad) that died one day apart in their early 50's. To have a treasure like this is just wonderful.Getting the recipes together made me think of my Mom and MIL as Mom's happily cooking in the kitchen rather than of the breast cancer.Lisa--I cannot thank you enough for this book. I thank you...my family thanks you. It was a beautiful idea and the result is a precious book. So many of us have faced that terrible loss of premature death of our Mom by breast cancer. It made me feel I was not alone.I can't wait to try the other recipes and read all the stories.
3,Hebrew and Greek,"This book is designed for the serious Bible student who wants to discover as accurately as possible what the Bible meant in its original languages but who is not in a position to master those languases. This manual introduces the alaphabets and the basic elements of Hebrew and Greek grammar. With this foundation, the student is taught to use the basic language tools, including analyticals, lexicons, interlinears, concordances, and commentaries. I found this book very helpful in helping me learn about the Greek and Hebrew language and alaphabet, though it would take extreme dedication and motivation to master the language, it was a good ice breaker, so to say. Thank you Zondervan for the review copy."
2,Not a good book for beginners,"This book starts off great in the first lesson and then goes down hill. The first chapter goes into the simple parts of the language; however, by chapter two the lesson wants you to translate a page and a half story from Greek to English and answers questions about the story. I think the author had good intentions; however, I am disappointed in the book.On another note, the book is not put together well. My book started to fall apart as soon as I started using it. Pages started to fall out before I made it to lesson three. Thank goodness the book was not that expensive.Thanks,Scott G."
4,Princess DOLL,My great niece loved the doll and since I live in San Diego CA and she lives in Maui HI. I was kinda of worried that she wouldn't get it before her B/Day but she received it on time even a little early.....Thanks
5,Retail Selling Ain't Brain Surgery It's Twice as Hard,"This book is the perfect primer and a great reminder for anyone in working in sales. It clearly states all the steps needed to complete a successful sale in with any product. These steps do become automatic,with experience, but it never hurts to be reminded. Jim Dion's created an entertaining book out of what can be a dry subject. I own a clothing store and give this book to every new salesperson I hire. It can be read in an evening or two.I highly recommend this book to anyone dealing with the public."
2,Too Basic for the Seasoned Sales Professional,"This book might be helpful to someone who is just getting started in the retail industry, but for a seasoned sales professional it was too basic. It is written more like a textbook, so maybe it was meant for a beginner, but I was hoping for more ""meat"" when I bought it."
1,Too Basic,"This book was much too basic and didn't provide me with any information that I didn't already know, nor where there any real ideas or steps suggested by the author on how to be an outstanding sales professional. This book is just simply made up of ""common sense"" knowledge."
3,The obvious works,"I recently read a book called, ""Retail Selling Ain't Brain Surgery, It's Twice As Hard - 9 Steps to successful sales relationships"", by James E. Dion. As the title suggests, it is mostly about retailing. He has nine steps that every retailer should use to treat their customers well. As an occasional retail customer, I know that retail selling etiquette is sadly lacking and I think most retailers could benefit from reading this very simple and quick reading book.His nine steps are:The greetingNeeds determinationProduct knowledgeSuggestion sellingTrading upAnswering objectionsThe closeMaximizing last momentsAfter sales serviceBest read the book for full details.This is a great read for any retailer."
3,GOOD BUT...,"If you're a fan of what back then was called ""power metal"", I highly recommend this band. Sword produced some of the best power metal I've ever heard. Having said that, this particular album doesn't showcase their best work. I highly recommend you buy ""Metalized"" instead. ""Metalized"" was a truly inspired piece of work. However, if you already like this band and haven't heard this album, I think it's worth a couple of spins. The only advantage it has over ""Metalized"" is that it was recorded at a later date so it's a ""hotter"" sounding recording. The production is crystal clear. My personal favorites on this album are 1. Sweet Dreams, 6. Caught In The Act, and 7. Until Death Do Us Part. This album stands well on its own when not compared to ""Metalized"" but I just can't help comparing it (it is, after all, from the same band!!!)."
5,"It was much better than I expected; and based on 'Metalized', I expected a lot!","To me, this rates as one of the most underrated groups and albums of all times!It is an incredible album! Sword has put out two elite studio albums!"
5,Great seller and great product,I was surprised to learn when I went to Paris last month that they did not have her music at the stores because without doubt she is one of the greatest divas in the world!
3,"Moderately enjoyable, but not a clear storyline at all!!","I read this book after reading a description of it on-line. This book was OK but the author was very unclear in her ideas. Jane is miserable in her present and her past; it seems she can find nothing happy in her life. The only parts in the book I enjoyed were the descriptions of Jane's pregnancy, the beach, Mr. Denzer, and her relationship with Bee. Jane was not a very likeable character, the supporting characters made the book worth the time it took to read."
1,This was a ride on a roller coaster that has no ending.,I did not like this book at all. I found Jane to be lazy and confused about Everything in her life. I didn't understand her father going in her room and telling her lies when she was young. Her mother must have been on her death bed for 20 years....and the sister was just beyond understanding her role due to the fact she wasn't nuturing just distant. The book made no sense to me at all.
1,Don't waste your time...,"From reading the summary I thought it was going to be a really good book. I was disappointed to find that it was boring, it didn't have a strong plot to pull me in. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Helpful but brief...,"A solid introduction to the Bible, this book has some good commentary notes that are informative and insightful. I gave the book only 3 stars simply because it's a little too shy on the commentary, in my opinion. I would've liked more info, but I should've seen it coming since ""compact"" is in the title."
4,BETTER THAN THE OTHERS!!!!!,"I only read this because I had bought it along with ""Nobility"". I did not like ""Nobility"" at all but I read this one anyway. It is much better, in my openion, than his last two. Clay Cole is again the hero. He is hired by Nigel Apperson and Dr. Jane Reeves to guide them to the lost gold of Cortes. BAM, who shows up but Major Miles Perry who has been chasing Clay through the first two books. They declare a truce until the search for the treasure is over. This small group has to fight off Mexican outlaws and Comanches. The journey is long and many things happen along the way. There is much more action in this book than the last two. This one will hold your attention through most of it. Will Clay ever be a free man? Doesn't look good at this point."
5,Saw Selah perform Sun. at church and had to get their CD's!,"What a powerful group! They performed Sunday at my church, Evangelical Covenant in Lafayette, and I could have listened (and watched) them all day! Their expressions and powerful voices are so inspirational. Can't wait for their new CD which comes out in May!"
3,Nice jeans but....,"They are MUCH darker than then the picture. They fit well, seem very durable but... are VERY (almost NAVY) dark blue which is not what I wanted."
2,not worth the hype,"I must say, I am severely disappointed with the D80. I ""upgraded"" from the Kodak 14n, sacrificing megapixels for speed, shadow detail, and ease of use. Yes, the D80 is better in these capacities, but it lacks in one area that is critical- focusing. I have tried this camera with four lenses, both pro and amateur, including the new 18-200 VR, and still have yet to produce consistently sharp images. I have tried these lenses on two different D80s, and still run into the same problem. It's not motion blur, as the images are frozen, but still have an unacceptable soft-focus to them, almost as if the focal plane is out of alignment. My wife uses the D40 with kit lenses, and doesn't run into this. Now, maybe I'm doing something wrong, and I'm willing to listen, but when a subject is out of focus, shooting in daylight at f16, there's something wrong. I got better focus from my original D1."
2,It's a defective item,"It's a defective item, the lens couldn't auto focus, I haeve returned it, but you charged me shipping fee, I don't know why."
5,great camera with great lens,"lots of great lens's for this camera. i got the rebel xti but returned it after lens issues, I now have the D80 and love it. I got a ""4 million dollar home"" from crumpler as a case, fits it perfect with the 18-135 and a 50mm."
5,great!!!!!!!!!!,What's not to like? It ups the ante considerably from my D70. Just the improved viewfinder and low noise at high ISO were enough to justify the purchase.
5,Great Camera,I researched several cameras for a few months and I finally decided on the d80. I have been very happy with it. I'm usually a point and shoot kind of camera person and the d80 has made my photos look great. There's a great difference between SLR's and point and shoot. I would recommend this to all of my friends.The menu is very user friendly and downloading doesn't take very long. I bought the body and 55-200 VR lens seperately and saved money rather than buying the pre-made kit.
2,Maybe for a pro,I bought an SLR to take very nice pictures without the shutter delay of a point and shoot. I was tired of getting pictures of everyone after the candles were blown out on the birthday cakes! This is not my first nice SLR but it's the first one that requires setting adjustments immediately out of the box and continual adjustment just to take good pictures. (Default takes really dark pictures) My previous cameras blew away my point and shoot but not this one. Reading on the web there are ways to account for this but they are a pain and should not have to be done.
2,DISSAPOINTED,I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BRAND NEW FROM AMAZON WITH THE LENS PACKAGE IT CAME WITH. AFTER TAKING ONLY 68 SHOTS IT STOPPED WORKING. I GOT AN F-- ERROR. I REMOVED AND REPLACED THE LENS AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. THEN I NOTICED THAT THE TOP BORDER WAS BLACK. I HAVE HAD THE PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2.5 MONTHS SO IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. I FOUND OUT THAT I HAD TO PAY $37 TO SEND IT INSURED BY UPS TO NIKON. I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. I WAS SOLD A BAD EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT FROM THE BEGINNING AND I STILL HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK SO THAT THEY WOULD FIX IT. I DECIDED TO TRY NIKON BECAUSE MINOLTA WENT OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT WAS A SAD LOSS FOR THE PHOTO WORLD. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER NIKON AGAIN.
5,Excellent,"It doesn't get any better at this price point. Excellent build quality, very easy to use, and intuitive. The optics are simply brilliant for a kit lense (135MM).Went from a Canon Rebel film SLR which I loved, but when I tried to move into the XTi, there was just no comparison between the XTi and the D80. You could immediately feel the difference in quality and functionality. And the auto-clean feature is absolute marketing crap from Canon. THe CMOS shakes off the dust, but then where does the dust go? Bologna feature, not to mention the Flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up on the Canon XTi.The D80 blows it away, and for it's price there is nothing out there better. If your in the market at this price point, or relatively close, just go for it. You WILL NOT regret this purchase."
5,A great little brother,"I bought the D 80 body to lighten my load when traveling. The D200 is a wonderful machine but bulky. The D80 has all the important characteristics of its bigger brother,especially the bright viewfinder, and with the the 18-200 VR lens it is the perfect travel companion."
2,Did not recieve all that was expected,"I ordered a Nikon D80 camera body. By the description the necessary cables and battery charger were to be included, which they were not. But, I will say that the camera body was in the condition that was listed. I will not buy from this seller in the future."
4,This camera just feels good...,"I bought the camera refurbished from Cameta Camera 2 weeks ago and I really like it. It feels great in your hand, even better than the new D90 to me. I also have a Canon XSi which feels great in the hand too. I like the controls on the D80 better. It is more of a shooters camera than the Canon. I think they are both great cameras.All the pros and cons have been listed in prior reviews. Check out the D80 review at dpreview for all the details. The only feature on the D80 that I probably need to check on is the compressed NEF raw file format. The camera saves RAW files in a compressed format, although the details are sketchy. Nikon claims it is lossless process. I usually shoot large JPEGs with low compression - but I will update this review after I try opening some RAW shots in both Bibble & PSE to compare the results."
4,"Easy to use, good quality images","I was a professional photographer for fifteen years and used high end digital cameras- this provides easy flexibility for large files or small. The auto feature works well, and auto focus is quick. I recommend this model."
4,All good so far,"I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the D90 and the newer D5000 series with video recording, because I really wanted something cheaper to get started with a DSLR. Bought the standard lens and a 105mm lens to go with it. So far I really like this camera. It has a lot more features than I can handle as a novice but there are several forums that are immensely helpful. I still have ways to go before I can consider myself conversant with these features, but so far so good. Picture quality with both lenses is amazing, battery life is good, does feel bulky but then they all are."
4,Solid camera,I bought my D80 in early 2008 and have enjoyed using it. It has many useful features and produces very vivid pictures. It does want to over expose in certain circumstances and isn't the best at high iso low light situations.
5,D80 review,"I have owned the D50 for about a year, and after reading a report by Ken Rockwell I decided to upgrade. One feature I opted for is the variable ISO setting. It operates exactly as advertised and was worth the trade by itself. The increase from 6 to 10 Mpixels alone is not worth the extra investment, but I love the camera and would do it again. I use the 55mm to 200mm VR zoom with this body and it works!"
4,Great!,"This item was shipped quickly!And I knew what I was getting when I ordered this camera! Nikon makes a great product, and the complicated simplicity of camera is great. Now on to buying lens, filters, and flash..."
4,A Great DSLR Camera Nikon D80,"This is my first DSLR camera, i just got it on Tuesday. I am very satisfied with my slr camera and it got every feature I need. I shot some pictures for testing. The quality of pictures are excellent.I think that it definitely got my money worth. I would definitely recommend people to buy the Nikon D80 camera."
4,"Fast & Reliable, Great Deal!","I ordered this product late Thurs evening (PST). I couldn't wait for the Free Shipping to arrive, so I paid the extra 2 day shipping for this and the Nikon camera bag also through Amazon. ~$16 extra total for both shipping. Recieved the camera on Monday and the case on Tues. Through research and debate between this and the Cannon Rebel XTi, I chose this due to the massive reviews. I didn't mind paying the extra $100+ because this would hopefully be the only dSLR I plan on purchasing for a loong time. I chose Amazon to purchase because the price is still less than purchasing it through the store. (Camera + case = $1190 less than store where it's $1299 for camera & lens only.)Hopefully this helps, g'luck!Have yet to use it yet. Played around with it. Will edit once taken pictures!"
2,Great camera but now obsolete -don't buy it new now!,"This is a really great camera and I have had it for the last 4 years. I have now upgraded to the d7000 and the difference is awesome. HOWEVER if you want to buy a digital Nikon SLR you have two better options: 1) at this price look around for a Nikon D90 which is already like 4 year old but it's a more advanced model; 2) buy this camera used or refurbished for half the price or less of what you find here (now above $700); with what you save you can buy a nice, good lens.(again: nothing against this camera, but really buying it new in 2012, when it's already out of production, doesn't make any sense)"
5,Nice step-up from my D50,"I loved my Nikon D50! and had no complaints. But Santa gave me a D80, and who wouldn't want a few more MegaPixels, another half frame per second, and the ability to add a cool vertical grip :) Now I love my D80, and have zero complaints :)"
5,Great Camera!,"Years ago... I used to shoot a lot of 35mm slides, and my collection included several expensive Nikon lenses; when I initially switched to digital, the pro camera bodies were too expensive to consider.The best thing about this camera was the low price point, and the ability to drive older auto-focus lenses. I've since shot several hundred pictures; indoor, outdoor, and even had someone else use it to photograph my own wedding. The 10.2MP is more than enough to replace my orginal 2.1MP camera, which I handed down to my kids."
1,Unbelievable oversight by Nikon,"My wife purchased this camera after much research and comparison with the Canon DSLR products. She has used Nikons for decades and had some lens that would fit so we went with this camera. The one major disapointment with the Nikon product is that you can not compose a picture using the LCD screen on the back of the camera. Nowhere does Nikon tell you that this LCD is for playback ONLY. All of the Canon products have real time use of the LCD to compose pictures. Heck, even cell phones let you use their screens for real time photo composition. The lack of this function and the lack of any reference to the lack of this function by Nikon make this product unacceptable. Shame on you Nikon."
4,unsatisfied,"oneCall was very courtious, after I received the camera a Onecall rep followed up and called (very polite) to asked was I satisfied with the camera, but I informed them that hadn't tested it yet. when I did test the camera it didn't work, I called Onecall since it was within 30 days I was instructed to return the product for a full refund (minus shipping cost) I prepared the return package, before I placed the camera in the return package, I took the cam to an experienced Nikon user to test and it still didn't work, so immidiately I placed the cam in the return package and sent it back, I forgot to retrieve my 1 gig of secure digital memory from the camera.the reason I""m unsatisfied- when I called OneCall to see if they received the returned cam,1. their test found no defect in the cam, true or untrue.2. shipping cost amounted to $40.00, camera defected.3. OneCall claimed no memory card was locate.three days later I bought the same model elsewhere and it works fine."
1,Really Disappointed!,"I agree with the other reviewer! I am terribly disappointed that a camera did not come with this set--as the manufacturer's description indicated it would! I am going to call the manufacturer to make a formal complaint. This is a christmas gift and I just received it--not exactly enough time to go buy a camera!!!! Boo, Kodak!"
5,Full of information and cheap!,"I looked around for a book that had a lot of information about the Titanic, her passengers, and witness account of the tragic sinking. This book has all of that and so much more. It has details, survivors accounts of the sinking, and even information about each passenger, who was rich and known, on the ship. It tells of a sons account of surviving and the last time he saw his father on the ship.. This book it defiantly the most informational of all of the Titanic books on here. It keeps you hooked if you are just looking for a book to read every now-and-then or if you are a Titanic-fanatic like myself. Great read!"
5,The Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters,"Very good reprint of the original book. I own the original, but it is in very poor condition, so this reprint allows me to read the book as printed in 1912, without further damaging the orginal. Definitely a good value."
2,not impressed,"I didn't like the wording. You practically have to read the book with a dictionary next to you. The story was OK, but could've been better and there weren't any pictures. I give this 2 out of 5 stars."
2,Blurbs masquerading as comments,"I usually find Amazon readers' comments valuable, but after buying this book, Setting Up Your Scenes, I noticed that several of the five-star reviews also appear word-for-word in the front of the book as blurbs, probably solicited as back-scratching by the publisher and author, which suggested to me that the only meaningful comments here are the negative ones. I returned the book and will more carefully consider any Michael Weise products I find on Amazon."
1,Settubg up Your Scenes,"I found the book to be disappointing in that the shot descriptions were not placed in the order of the edited scene. Rather, all the extreme wide shots were listed together, then all the wide shots, then all the medium shots, etc. This left the reader to guess how the shots were put together. In my opinion, that defeated the purpose of the book. A better approach would have been to list the shot descriptions as a caption to the still photos, and describ intervening shots that could not be represented by a photo."
5,Great for the Whole Family,"O.K. so it may not be an emmy award but it is still pretty good. I love it. I think it is the Olsen Twins best movie. With Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenburgh they really light up the screen and don't forget about the adorable twins. Veary much like the Parent Trap. Good for all ages, whether your an Olsen fan or not you will love it. I know I do. I don't see why some other people say there was really bad acting but I think the acting is really good. Very simular to the Parent Trap and I love that movie also. This would be the best Olsen movie."
5,incredibly cute,Mary-Kate and Ashley are adorable in this movie. The whole film is perfect and never stops being perfect no matter how many times you watch it. Even if you don't usually buy Mary-Kate and Ashley videos you will love this one - not all of the movie revolves around them. The other actors do an excellent job at keeping us entertained.
5,Memories...,I ordered this movie because it was one of my favorites as a little girl and this was the only dvd copy I could find that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. As soon as it came in I popped it into the dvd player and it works great just as described and it got to me in great timing. THANK YOU!
5,Great Movie! Not for kids under 8.,"This is a great movie. It is so good I watch it over and over. I am the Olsens #1 fan. And I am 10 years old. Kids under 8 wont understand. Mary-kate Olsen plays Amanda, the orphan. And Ashley Olsen plays Allisa, the tycoons (Steve Guttenberg) daughter. This movie is for Olsen and non-Olsen fans. If you are not an Olsen fan, YOU SHOULD BE! This movie shows how the two girls michieviously gets the two adults together when Roger (the tycoon) has another woman he is going to marry in a month. And how they got Roger to say ""I cant."" at the wedding with his date before he met Diane."
5,It Takes Two,"It's an excellent movie, but if you copy the language you hear on movies (and you're under the age of say, 20) maybe not. Amanda is an orphan heading off to Camp Callaway (coincidentally owned by Alyssa's father Roger) with her best friend and social worker Diane Barrows. Alyssa is a rich little girl who hardly sees her father at all, and he is getting married to an abnormally horrendous woman. When the girls bump smack into each other in the woods, they find that they are complete look-alikes. Together they scheme to bring Alyssa's father and Diane together before adoption and marriage break them up. A great movie, especially for fans of the Olsens. It's just a Parent Trap knock off."
5,This moive is just like the Parent Trap.,This moive great it is just like the Parent Trap but more like its owen. Sorry about my spelling after all I am only nine.
5,It Takes Two,"This is one of those movies that I would watch over and over every day when I was about 10. I love this movie, of coarse,I dont watch it much anymore, but I think its actually well acted and moste like a movie than all their other movies!"
2,Mary-Kate & Ashley remake Parent Trap [2.5 stars],"If you've seen Parent Trap (either verion), you've see It Takes Two. It is incredibly predictable. Even so, the girls are cute and the story line has plenty of fun and mischief built into it. Pre-teen girls will especially like this movie. There are some elements for adults - at least parents of children - to enjoy.One small note of caution: there's a subtle but questionable message in this movie. The wicked soon-to-be stepmother of one of the girls is driven away, giving the story its fairytale ending. As that plays out, the message is sent that its good to humiliate and embarrass those that have wronged us . Of course, the revenge exacted on the villainess is all in fun and somewhat deserved; nevertheless, the revenge message is fairly clear. It presents a great opportunity for parents to discuss with their kids the ""Golden Rule."""
1,It takes two,I wasn't aware that it couldn't play in the UK so it wasn't any good for me. Then when I tryed to contact amazon.com and the original seller they couldn't understand me and it just ran up the phone bill. So it would be nice for this to be highlighted for other customers.
5,IT REALLY DOES TAKE 2!,This has got to be one of my most fave mary-kate and ashley films and thats probably because it the first time i saw the olsen twins! But this movie made me a true olsen twin fan! Because of it's cute little scenes and dramatic story line it is so for the NO. 1 fans of the twins! It is sort of like the parent trap but with twist and loadz a fun thrown in! So if your a true MKA fan then you gotta see this film!
4,Great family movie!,I remember this movie from when i was younger. I really loved the olsen twins so i am purchasing all their movies to re-live my chilhood! They are such funand great to watch as a family! And if u don't have kids they're great to watch by yourself...they're corny but great movies!!!
5,Best movie in the world,This movie to me is one that I will enjoy for a very long time. I laugh so much during this movie. I love it.
1,"Yuck, Ew, Ick, Spew!!!!!!!","What words could describe the undue vileness which is this film. The story is a complete rip off of the parent trap, except that it lacks all the that movie's charm. Can someone tell me if there is an island that we can use to drop off Steve Guttenberg and The Olsen twins, so we can make sure that a travesty like this never ever happens again? Oh please say yes. I will pay money, big money.Otherwise, if you are lacking a cerebral cortex, you will love this movie."
1,ARE YOU JOKING?,Are you joking? Are people supposed to like this ick? The Olsen twins are so incredibly bad at acting it makes you wonder why anyone would want to hire thhem for any movie. THEY JUST CAN'T ACT!!
3,Brings back memories,This movie was a childhood favorite of mine. Made me laugh all the time and brings back Lots of old memories.
5,IT TAKES TWO BABY!!!!,"I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT IS A LATER ADAPTION OF THE PARENT TRAP BUT FUNNIER. I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT HAS STEVE GUTTENBERG, KIRSTIE ALLEY, AND THE OLSON TWINS . I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT WAS FUNNY. AND IT WAS GOOD AND THE TWINS DID A GOOD JOB AND HAD FIXED THAT MEAN STEPMOTHER GOOD. IF YOU LIKED THE PARENT TRAP WITH HALEY MILLS THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY ENJOY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"
3,Bad Acting,"This movie is a little funny and dramactic, but it has very bad acting. I don't know what people see in those bad acting Olsen twins anyways."
1,We have not received this order,"Sadly we ordered this Product over 8 weeks ago but have still not received it.We usually have wonderful service and our orders arrive promptly, just not this time.Hopefully it will arrive before Christmas."
5,This movie is better than Seabiscuit!,"Let me begin by saying I'm not an official member of the Olsen twin fan club, but I love those girls. Now that they're 18+ I can love them and not feel too dirty about it.I believe this movie is completely quotable. Come on, think of your favorite quote from the movie and use it on a daily basis. That's what I do! I burned a hole in the first VHS I owned from playing the same part over and over again."
1,cute movie ruined dvd,"WB ruined the dvd of ""It takes two"" by releasing it in full screen only. it was filmed in widescreen. re-release it in letterboxx."
1,Stupid,"The most retarded movie in the world. Can you say ""Parent Trap copy-cat"" ? The Olsen twins are sappy and almost to cute. They can't act and need a new job. I wonder why Kirsty Alley would stoop this low ? I guess she needed some pocket change. But I wouldn't take a million bucks to work with those two!"
5,So cool!,This movie is the best movie I ever saw from the Olsen twins!I'm a big Olsen fan!!!!!!!And this movie is my favourite one!I'll never forget how the movie goes!Because I watch it over and over again!You have to buy this item! Because it's a family fun movie!You'll love it! Mary-Kate and Ashley show the best of themselves in this movie! They're acting very natural!!!! It's the best movie ever!
4,very comfortable work shoes,This is my first pair of Dr.Marten's. They are very comfortable work shoes. I will buy another pair in the future.
4,An asana dictionary,"Hatha Yoga I serves as an excellent reference for some of the foundation Hatha yoga postures(asanas). The photographs and text descriptions clearly and simply explain how to attain the asana, how long to stay in the posture, and pranayama (how to breathe, a key feature of yoga). Some asana descriptions list what benefits the posture is said to yield. The book is meaningfully organized. It begins with a brief introduction, suggested manual use, what frame of mind to cultivate (mind postures), some terminology, and the physiology of breathing before getting into the postures. Hatha Yoga Manual I is a good beginning yoga text."
5,SUPERB,"The other day I picked up my old, worn copy of Randi James' marvelous, witty history of magic and detailed in his arch raconteuring about the profession that I once knew so well. The book endures. And that--poof!--is all."
3,Disorderly history,"The Amazing Randi is an amazingly versatile and knowledgable writer, conjuror and critic of pseudoscience and supernatural claims. His history of the honorable profession of conjuring is full of interesting material, but the presentation is somewhat disorderly and in parts repetitive. It looks like Randi wanted to present his wonderful stuff under all aspects at once - chronological, geographical, typological, personal etc - and this method simply does not work well. For all this, the book is very interesting and worth it's price."
5,"Once again, a beautiful book....","Hometown Tales is another book full of wonderful tales about life. Beautiful stories that remind us to sit back for a second, look around us, and take it all in. Philip Guelly truley understands what it means to appreciate the little things in life. His stories get you thinking about the all the things we take and have taken for granted...about memories long past...and how to make this life a little better for ourselves. And most importantly, he always remindes you that there's someone up above looking out for us."
4,Phil has done it again.,Another light-hearted look at life and growing up in a small Indiana town. I can really identify with a lot of these charming stories. Another great book by Phil Gulley. He can seem to find a good lesson in anything!
5,Excellent reading Hometown Tales,"If you seek humorous but wholesome reading, something to spend a few minutes doing when you're ready to konk out at night or while waiting for an appointment, Philip Gulley provides it and more in this selection. I love everything he's ever done, but this one is especially good because it provides personal glimpses of him. My only regret about this book is that I shared it with a friend and need to order another one."
5,Great Book,"WOW- This is a great book, beautiful cover, great info. A MUST HAVE for anyone working in Maternal/Child Health. Even after working with breastfeeding women for years, there's still so much more to learn, and this book really does cover IT ALL. It is also A MUST HAVE for anyone taking the IBCLC exam! Very helpful."
4,Pure Primitives,"This is one of those records that has that great, late 80's alternative sound to it. Yes, I do have it on vinyl. Though it does have a few moody tracks, it's really pop for the most part. I might say they remind me of The Sunday's, or Lush, but whatever they sound like, it's good. Some copies of this CD have 4 extra tracks that include a cover of The Velvet Underground's ""I'll be your mirror"". I'm sure you'll have to pick this up used, but it's well worth looking for."
3,Not bad,"I can think of a lot of other great games I woud of liked to have seen in this collection like '86 Nebraska, '75 Nebraska, or '77 Ohio State, but not bad."
1,LG Sucks!,"I have the forerunner of this item, and if my experience with it is indicative of LG as a whole, watch out! My set did not work correctly from day one. I had it repaired in less than 30 days, but the problem persisted, albeit, intermittantly. Finally, I was so tired of the intermittant problem, I had the set repaired again. Now it doesn't work at all! LG said the set has to be ""repaired"" yet again before they will authorize replacement even though the main board has been replaced 2x, and the power supply has been replaced. So I get to sit home and wait for repair people that don't show up on time, be without my nice TV for weeks on end, and get this, even if they do fix it or replace it, they will only extend the warranty 90 days. WHAT A CROCK! Oh, and by the way, I bought it at Ken Crane's and they refuse to do anything about it, not to mention the salesperson told me there was a 2 year warranty, although it was really only one year. Have fun!"
2,Don't buy it online.,Neither UPS nor Fedex will insure such an amount. Better go to Brick and mortar.Hook this baby up to a mac and watch MS go nuts. Again.
1,I would have given it one star,"While I have never owned this tv, it is underwhelming for a price of over $4mm, truly amazing for such old technology."
1,So boring...and still waiting for the funny part,I'm not sure what crazy person described this as hilarious. I am 3/4 of the way through and still waiting for one funny line.
1,very poor,"I bought this to do the inside of an oven in the seams as it said it was good to 450 degrees, but it started coming off at about 300 and was gone at 400."
2,Adhesive separates,I used this to shield exhaust heat from my transmission tunnel. The fiberglass portion separated from the adhesive tape after maximum 2 weeks of driving-- so now theres just clear tape attached to my car. Not very helpful
3,OK but...,I'd rather read her book than listen to her speak. She wears me out. Her background is Very interesting.My biggest problem with the book is: I'm in the year that MORE people DIE than any other year - according to her. YIKES!!!Maybe I'm spoiled by Colette Baron-Reid. I didn't learn anything new. (Except that this is probably my last year on Earth - HA!!)She is just ho hum for me but I'm sure she will strike a cord with others. I believe she's sincere.
5,"Take out your pencils, discover your Destiny Code!","A really great book. Dr. Harra provides us a very simple way to identify our soul code and determine which cycle we are in. The individual cycles allow us to make decisions about our future, tell us what to expect, which people are coming into our lives, and how to overcome obstacles.The second half really provides valuable information about manifesting our goals. Dr. Harra, a licensed psychologist, teaches us about Harnessing the tools of our mind, Creating our own realities, and Overcoming fears.Excellent book, excellent work! Take out your pencils!- Omar W. RosalesAuthor ""Elemental Shaman""Elemental Shaman: One Man's Journey Into the Heart of Humanity, Spirituality & Ecology"
4,Full Length Movie,"This is not your normal My Friends Tigger and Pooh (3 episodes/6 stories) put to DVD. It's one main feature where an asteroid hits Rabbit's garden, the Super Sleuths eat hyped-up veggies that result and get super powers. There is a bonus never-before-seen episode: Darby Gets Lemon, Makes Lemonade/ Dancing with Darby. Box says run time is 45 mins but I haven't paid attention to whether that includes the bonus episode or not, but I don't think so."
5,A good My Friends Tigger and Pooh,"While they did show this full-length (1 hour) new episode on the Disney Channel, it was a new episode and it's actually quite good - our 3-year-old loves it."
2,Skip this one...,"While there are some great ideas in this book, they seem to be too few and you have to read through too many generalizations and overstated guesses about the future of distance learning.It also seems that the book is intended for the person or training organization that wants to dominate the market and make lots of money in their field of expertise. It is NOT effective survey or current technologies or teaching methodologies.One section that I did find useful, were his tips on creating online interaction (Chapter 11) where he offered some useful tips for encouraging participation in an online course.*The book was published and there has since been a 2nd version, so if you feel inclined to read it be sure to pick up the latest version."
2,Not glad.,"My watch arrived and I was initially happy with it, but one day, suddenly, my watch fell and I realized that its wristband had become loose. I thought it might be a simple matter of placing a pin in its right place (as the watch had come with a puzzling addional pin of the type frequenly used in wristbands. But when I looked more carefully, it was apparent that there were no holes for the pin to go into. Therefore I am left with a perfectly working watch but no way to wear it... To top it all, I threw away the receipt, so I don't know where to send it, whether it has any warranty or what..."
2,sucky repair,"usually have good things to say about milwaukee tools, this one however reconditioned did not satisfy. the clutch was defective right out of the box, i sent it to milwaukee repair and on return is better but still the clutch won't hold for drilling..."
3,Typical for Architectural Monographs from Academy,"Projects of a British architect of Post-Modernism - James Stirling's partner until 1963 - illustrated by B&W and color photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line axonometric views, hand sketches, and short text descriptions; ISBN: 0856704083 (PB), ISBN: 0847801942 (PB)."
2,Daughter just not interested,"I thought this looked like a cool toy and it had some great reviews, but my 4 year old daughter is just not a bit interested. She loves puzzles and building things with blocks and magna-tiles and is pretty smart for her age, but she just doesn't find this toy appealing. I'm disappointed and hope she'll maybe grow into it. It is durable and educational and does everything is says on the box, but she gets bored with it after just a few minutes. No doubt it will work for others but this was a waste of money for us.***UPDATE*** Now a year and a half later and this has really never been played with. Just shows that however good reviews are, all kids are different and respond differently to things."
5,Block Buddies,"This is great for 5 year olds that don't need guidance. I used it in my 3 year old school class and found that the cards could be a little sturdier (bent, put in mouth, etc.) and that I had to help the kids more with the orientation of the piece. They were able to pick the pieces they needed, but weren't sure how to place them."
5,great toy,"I got ""block buddies"" for my 4 year old grandson. He loves it! This toy allows him to play quietly while developing his visual preception and attention skills. It is a great toy to play with a parent or friend or alone. As a special educator who understands the developmental learning process, I highly recommend this toy. The only negative I found is that the pieces were smaller than I expected."
3,I liked this better when it was called Just One of the Guys.,"She's the Man is pretty amusing and entertaining, but there are other movies in the same theme that are better, namely Just One of the Guys.I couldn't believe the similarities between the movies: even down to the ""I have to do this for two weeks in another school to prove myself"" theme.I remember Amanda Bynes from Nickelodeon, and I really liked her brand of comedy. She's pretty good at carrying the movie.Bottom Line: a decent movie but nowhere near great."
4,Really Enjoyed it,"I found the movie to be cute and refresshing. It's not Vulgar or sex crazed, therefore I would have no problem watching it with my nieces. Its a pleasure to see a teen acting like a teen, not a slut."
2,Disappointing,Classic Amanda Bines. Two or three music montages. There are some jokes on the level of American Pie. Wasn't expecting that. Wish I'd rented (or borrowed).
4,Fun movie,Quite the funny movie. Vinnie Jones as the soccer coach and David Cross as the school principal are icing on the cake in this comedy!
4,She's the man,This movie was hilarious. Amanda Bynes was very funny. The movie would be better if someone else played Amanda's brother and her roommate. The actor playing her brother was too tall and too big for anyone to mistaken them as the same person. Channing Tatum (roommate) just looked too old to be in high school.
5,she's the man,this is so funny i loved seeing this film and i loved amanda and channing together on screen that had such a connection
3,She was THE man!,"I bought this good natured DVD for my girls who are 7 and 9 years old. I am a child of the 80's and this movie reminded me of my all time favorite ""girl wants to be a boy flick,"" ""Just One of the Guys"". That movie was much more sexually advanced and had some nudity and profane language that I want to shield my girls from at this time. In any event, I LOVE Amanda Bynes and so do my girls, she is a real cutie and actually very funny. (Check out her old Nickelodean show, The Amanda Show) She reminded me of a young Carol Burnett, playing all of those skits. I do reccomend the movie as it is great for little kids and not to profane or sexually explicit."
4,See What You Will,"If reading classics hurts your brainAnd Twelfth Night seems too hardConsider watching ""She's the Man""Inspired by the BardSebastian and ViolaAre twins, but not the sameHe's the one that writes the songsShe plays at Beckham's gameWhen her soccer team gets cutShe puts on a disguiseHeads off to a competing schoolTo be one of the guysAlthough she doesn't look that maleAnd shouldn't fool a soulAmanda Bynes sure looks like she'sEnjoying this strange roleHer room mate likes OliviaWho likes ""Sebastian""And when she dumps her brother's girlShe proves that she's the manBut one day at a carnivalThings take a sudden twist""Sebastian"" falls for a guyThat as a girl she's kissedThis dizzy movie's Shakespeare liteBut is a lot of funAnd if you're over twelve years oldI think you'll like this oneAmanda Richards, December 17, 2006"
5,Great story line,This is an awesome story about a girl pretending to be her brother to play soccer. It all gets complicated when she falls for her brothers roommate and her brother comes back early. Please watch this movie for more.
3,fun to watch,"I just brought this for my daughter and she loves it. She took the DVD movie and started to watch it. It was fun watching Amanda to pass for a boy and play soccer. I liked the Head Master, funny guy."
4,She's The Man,"The acting, isn't the best of course and the comedy is a bit over the top, but it still makes me laugh every time. Love Amanda Bynes, Channing Tatum, and Robert Hoffman. Wonderful trio."
5,:),this movie made me laugh and was great. i recomend it to anyone wanting a new movie because its cheap and funny :)
3,Entertaining,"Yeah, I got dragged along to go see this with my eleven year old neice and nearly 5 year old daughter.I was entertained and give it a recommendation as a decent family flick, yes, there was some edgy humor and a bit of sexuality, however, for the most part it was tame enough for the older child and over the head of the younger one.When I can take the kids to the show and still feel like I'm being entertained while they are having fun, it's a good deal."
4,Fun To Watch,"Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a star in the girl's soccer team at school. Due to lack of girls who would like to join the team, the girls soccer team is ended. Viola's twin brother (Sebastion) goes to London for two weeks so Viola poses as him to get on the guys soccer team. The movie has a nice love triangle - or more than a triangle. It is fun to see how Viola copes with living in a guys dorm. The story is nice, and funny. The acting is good. Overall it is a nice, simple movie to watch."
4,Amanda Bynes lights up the screen!,"And gives us a wonderful performance as Viola, who after the girls soccer team is cancelled; she decides to become a guy and try out for the guy's team. now, not everything is explained in this, it's not overly realistic. but it doesn't need to be. this film is inventive and has alot of twists, it's funny and I think it's worth your time!"
4,Good Movie - 4.5 Stars,"I loved this movie. It wasn't exactly true to Shakespeare's play, but it's the same plot. Basically the movie is Shakespeare's play (Twelfth Night) based in today's world. I'm a sucker for secret love movies and I really liked this movie (I laughed a lot). If you like this theme (love in disguise) then check out Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. I enjoyed the Trevor Nunn's movie version of it also (starring Ben Kingsly and Helena Bonham Carter)."
4,Very funny,"This was a very well done teen movie, and it is watchable for a much wider audience. This is enjoyable entertainment that just about anyone 13 and up could enjoy. Amanda Bynes was a delight. I will say that Duke had to be a little on the slow side brain ways not to figure out that his roommate was a girl, but that is part of the cuteness of the movie, much like the part of Viola in Twelfth Night. You have to suspend reality a bit to go along with the premise but it's worth it. Also, the soccer coach at good old Illyria. He was a hoot. Good movie. Watch it. Have fun."
4,Hilarious!,"I have watched this movie a good number of times, but I still laugh every single time!! Definitely watch this with your friends. I usually do not care for Amanda Bynes, but she is really funny in this movie. I was also afraid that it would be one of those bad adaptations to Shakespeare featuring sports and teenagers etc., but I was surprised to find that I loved it!"
4,Alot of Fun! Great Acting! For Kids and Adults Alike!,"This film is ""clean"" and can be watched by the entire family and just as importatnly, ENJOYED by the entire family. It's a funny film. Recommended. Email:boland7214@aol."
4,Entertaining comedy,"This clever and funny comedy shoots and scores in many areas as a whole, but it also misses in bits and pieces as well. Headlining actress Bynes gives an over-the-top and somewhat unbelievable (though hugely entertaining) performance as a girl high school soccer star turned boy high school soccer star, but for some odd reason despite the obvious that she's, well, a girl you feel like rooting for her (or him?) anyway; of course, being a Hollywood movie it has its typical Hollywood cheesy moments, such as falling in love with her hot roommate. Regardless, the script is cleverly produced and manufactured brilliantly despite the oft-extreme acting jobs by many of the characters, but in the end that doesn't matter a bit. It's still an enjoyable, though flawed movie everybody can enjoy."
5,Great movie,"Very funny movie.I would recommended this for everyoneSome bad parts-swearing, but teens and up.I like it a lot"
4,Very Funny!,I had a hard time keeping a straight face while watching this movie. The comedic timing and nonsense is hysterical.
5,A Rogue's Proposal,I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Stephanie Laurens work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
3,DEMON'S SO INTERESTING,I HAVE READ MOST OF THE CYNSTER'S NOVEL...AND THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVORITE!YOU DON'T FIND MEN LIKE DEMON ANY MORE..SO STRONG AND SO PROTECTIVE OF FELICITY.
5,Another Cynster falls to Cupid!,"In""A Rogue's Proposal"", Laurens takes a tried and true formula and again provides a hot romance featuring one of the Bar Cynster. Her heroine is worthy of Demon Cynster and introduces a setting out of London. The reader is exposed to the world of racing and throughbred horses...a world that dominated Regency England. Fans of Stephanie Laurens will not be disappointed!"
5,A Very Good Read!,"I absolutley loved this book! It had humor, suspence, and of course the passion that these books revolve around. Stephanie Laurens (The author) has the ability to make you feel like you are the heroine in her books. I cannot wait to read the other books in this Bar Cynster series. I recommend getting the whole series!"
4,Best yet,"I found this book very entertaining. Where I thought the plotdragged on a little, the love scenes were some of the best I'veread. This was the first book in this particular series I had read, and I found it to be Ms. Laurens' best work to date."
3,try trilogy,"This wasn't a 'bad' book per-say...and it was at least a little different from the previous three where the Hero immediately gives up the idea of being a life-long-bachelor as soon as he sees the heroine...but I still wasn't as in love with it as I had been with A Rake's Vow or Devil's Bride.Lauren's is good for a light read but I found myself actually having to concentrate on finishing the book. Really now, what's the fun in that. Because of an anal-retentive tendency on my own part, I'll probably finish the series. I won't however actually buy the rest. It's off to the library for me. I've also started her Bastion Club series (I've only read the first). I can say it was very good, but I'm worried the series will fall into the same rut as this one appears to have done. Maybe she should try for Trilogies, that way the story line doens't get so tired."
2,What a snoozer...not as enjoyable as the first two novels,"I found myself leafing through the book to get the story to move on. Characters were not well developed, and the comraderie, humor and intensity that existed between the main characers in Devil's bride and and Rake's vow were missing in this book. The character Dillon seemed to be a side thought. Hope the next in the series is better reading."
2,I was disappointed and even a bit bored by this book.,"The first book in the Cynster series, Devil's Bride, was the best. The Romance was strong and while the secondary story was interesting, it didn't overshadow the love story. Unfortunately, each successive book seems to diminish in quality. I found A Rogues Proposal to have flat characters, a polt that overshadowed the romance with a mystery that seemed to never end. To make matters worse, Ms. Laurens' usually fantastic and frequent sex scenes were missing. I was hoping this book would be similar to Captain Jack's Woman, with a woman pretending to be a boy, but it lacked spontaneity of plot and the in depth charaterizations of the hero and heroine that Captain Jack's Woman had. I wish Ms. Laurens better luck next time."
1,Poor Quality,I have never purchased a used book that was listed Good that was in such bad shape. I had to even tape the cover and first page of the book. If this the the way this company rates their books on a regular basis I do not want to buy used books from them again.
4,I couldn't put this book down!,"I've never read any of Stephanie Laurens books before, but now I'd like to read everything that she has written, especially the ones on the Bar Cynsters. There was romance, intrigue and elements of danger both from the syndicate and from Demon himself and of course--undying love. I'm looking forward to reading the stories about the rest of the family."
2,not the best,"After reading many favourable reviews on this book, I rushed off and bought it almost straight away. Well, I was in for a disappointment. The first half of the story moved at a very slow pace. I was bored to tears despite the mystery, which is transparent and uninteresting by the way, obligingly thrown in by the author. Paragraphs after paragraphs of lengthy exposition just went on and on. And the sex! Well, don't get me wrong. I love plenty of steamy and well written love scenes in a romance, but 10 plus pages of boring, lengthy and repititive love scenes! Give me a break. The second half was slightly better, with a little more drama between the hero and heroine, but that couldn't save the whole story from being a boring and mediocre read.If you are new to Steph. Laurens, perhaps you'll find this book not bad at all. But having gone through the whole series of the Cynster clones, I find that the overused formula in these books just doen't work for me anymore."
2,Sweet beginning/Raunchy ending,"Maybe I am old fashioned but I like a little romance in my romance novels. The beginning was nice, interesting characters and a promise of a good mystery. But the character get so overwrought, it was a bit to much. And whew the sex scene were absolutely raunchy! I was afraid to take the book out of the house. The mystery part totally disappeared and the book fizzled to an end. If the writer pays a little more attention to the story line she might become a first rate romance writer."
3,what happened to Demon's father??,"The Cynster men are supposed to be faithful husbands, alpha males, handsome, strong, etc. Yet Demon's love interest stays in town with his parents and apparently has little interaction with her prospective father-in-law, who does not accompany his wife of 30+ years to social events, and only speaks once: at his son's wedding! There are no observations by Demon or Felicity on his parents' marriage, and Demon never seeks advice from his own father (despite the potential for danger in the horse-racing plot). As Felicity decides whether to marry Demon, she thinks of her parents' marriage and the General's marriage - but what of her in-laws' marriage, since she's staying in their home? Demon's father shows no interest in his son's life. This is what happens to a Cynster male after 30+ years of marriage??"
4,Little Spitefire....,That's what Felicity (Flick)is. She's young but doesn't let anyone push her around. She wasn't stupid or dimwitted. She was very knowledgeable. Stephanie has a great talent for love scenes and making her characters seem real. You just truely fall in love with them. Demon was of course nobody's fool. What Cynster is? Don't miss this book in the Cynster series you will not be disappointed.
1,...,"This has to be Laurens' worst one in the series. Besides the incredibly unlikeable heroine and arrogant hero, the plot was ultra boring. I was only about four chapters into it when I wanted to stop. Usually I give up about 3 quarters of the way through, because I like Stephanie Laurens but her books are always so wordy that I have to scan pages to get enough of an idea of the situation. But this book was so hard for me to continue, I just gave up not even a third of the way through."
4,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!! THE CYNSTERS ARE AMAZING!!!!,"This story was great! The Cynsters are so amazing I wish they were real!! The plot was good and the characters were great. The age difference between Flick and Demon adds spice and excitement to the story. The characters are well-developed and so much fun to read about! Stephanie is one of the best writers out there! Read this book now, Stephanie truly has a gift, you won't be sorry! Next thing you know, you'll be sitting down and writing a review on one of your new favorite books."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","After hearing so much about this writer, I was unbelievably disappointed in this book. Cardboard characters, a silly and plodding plot, purple prose, and a zillion cliches. There are some good writers still doing romances, but Ms. Laurens isn't one of them. Do yourself a favor, and give it a miss."
3,Lost in interest towards the end,"Thought the book started out great, but once they went to London, it got veeerrrry slow. Could hardly bring myself to finish it. I thought Devil's Bride and A Rogue's Proposal were much better."
4,How to safeguard your e-business customers,"The ubiquitous Internet is a double-edged sword. A major benefit is sharing information; a major detriment is the risk to customers of divulging private information. For e-businesses, therefore, privacy is a showstopper issue. This book was written to promote e-business success by helping organizations evaluate privacy needs, establish a privacy task force, use technologies to provide maximum protection, formulate privacy policies and procedures, implement and test privacy procedures, and monitor and modify privacy protection. This one's a winner--for companies that want to ""win"" at e-business."
5,A Must-Read for Information Technology Managers,"This book covers all aspects of internet security, from specific areas of corporate vulnerability to issues surrounding desktop privacy. It contains boilerplate implementation plans and timelines for these plans, which when taken together will help to make computer security a corporate reality. A must-read for Information Technology managers."
4,Where's that hit?,"The Hoodoo Gurus' first album for RCA provided a lot of hit potential that sadly never materialized (""Come Anytime"" was as close as they came to it on the college charts) but Dave Faulkner's guitar-jangly, hook-laden tunes never broke though into the pop mainstream. Too bad; virtually every song here could have been a contender. Self-produced, polished without being slick, and literate, the band never found a foothold in the tide of post-Nirvana rock that washed up on radio in the mid-90s. Star-crossed with a label that didn't know how to promote them (realizing RCA's less-than-stellar track record with its rock acts, they even needled the label with the baseball-metaphor ""Where's That Hit?"") even great songs weren't enough to get this album heard."
4,Memories,"A friend of mine in high school turned me on to this band, and this album. I even got the DJ to play Shadow Me at prom (1992). This album never got the notice or appreciation that it deserved in my opinion. Get a copy, slap it in and prepare yourself for some great sound and a good time."
3,Too different to other barbies,"I have bought quite a few barbies from Amazon recently, including the caligirl series, fashion fever series, and barbie loves micky mouse. This barbie is quite different to all above. She does not have a rubber skin like others, so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts. Her foot is quite flat; only the slippers in this package fit her; all other barbies' shoes do not. I guess this ""pooh"" might be made with the ""former generation"" technology."
3,sing america,I had this cd several years ago and it had been stolen with several cds. I have been looking in stores on and off and was never able to locate it again.I really enjoy this cd for the variety of artists as well as the songs of old and newer ones too. My children enjoyed listening as we would travel on vacations and to visit family. It has been used as a teaching tool as well.
4,One Word...CHER,"There is no one on this earth like Cher...she is incredible. After watching her sing the Star Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl, I knew that I had just witnessed a monumental moment. Her voice just soars, it is amazing. As for the rest of the album, there are a few standouts(but it is all about Cher!), LeAnn Rimes ""God Bless America"" is brilliant, and Judy Collins' wonderful ""Amazing Grace"" makes me cry real tears...oh Neil's ""America"" is still so wonderful after all these years. But of course, Cher closes the album and leaves you on the floor and bent over backwards."
3,Disappointing,"Great openning, good premise, good cast- poor execution down the stretch. I preferred Invasion, which had a similar plot line."
5,Deserving of a Better Fate,"I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on the characters and plot - that's been done more than adequetely by other reviewers. In fact, all I really wanted to say was that CBS did *all* science fiction fans a disservice with their far-too-hasty decision to cancel this show. I don't say that lightly, either. This one started out good, and every episode got better. There were literally years of viable plot threads set up in these few episodes, which of course will now never come to fruition... If ever a series deserved another shot at life, this would be the one. Are you listening CBS (or anyone else)?"
4,Not too awful for Normal Broadcasting in the US,"Carla Gugino just cannot make any series look bad, she is one of the most gorgeous women out there, and does it without being brassy, or ""Makes ya feel guilty"". My wife even likes her.THis series has many familiar faces, and there are some scenes that can be in the same vein of CSI, with their graphic effects of humankind at its worst (Read, VERY UGLY, DEFORMED HEADS, and lotsa blood)Lotsa violence, killing, etc., but nuthin' we haven't seen before, but not for those under ten.....The series runs smoothly, and there's enough continuity to keep a good pace.The ending seems to be one of, ""Well, looks like this is it, gonna have to come with some sorta ending....)Still, for a great summer at the beach house, or at the ski lodge, or ??? anywher ya wanna kick back and veg, but cannot stand for one more Reality Drek....My favorite scene(s)?Lettuce with Uggghh, Human Teeth...Really!"
3,Threshold,"It was already, but I really wanted to see the last episode, but it is not there!.So, No last episode ever been seen anywhere!"
2,Caution: Disappointing!,"Yes, the actors are well-chosen, the characters a little flat, the dialogues even flatter. Worst: The scientific background is ridiculous, nothing is close to credible. DNA-restructuring (into a triple-helix) is bad enough, but this happens via acoustic signals. Hello? Nobody seems to wonder what kind of crap they sell. The basic idea is not new, but OK. The way it is explained, scientifically, must repel anyone with a tiny bit of background knowledge. So: Save your money, rent the disks. And buy the 4400."
3,Still some episodes missing?,"The description of this product says it contains 12 episodes, yet tv.com lists 14 episodes (or 13 if you don't count the pilot as 2).So WHAT is missing? Why doesn't anyone list the episodes included on this DVD?As for my ""review,"" I didn't find this series to be as good as either ""Surface"" or ""Invasion."" I was bored by several episodes, and wasn't impressed with the way things were drawn out too long."
2,Why was it cancelled?,"... because it was bad.Granted, it did have a pretty interesting story model and was a little more inventive then the traditional ""alien invasion"" stories. I'll even go so far as to say that the network probably should have tried to hang in there with it a little longer. In the interest of fairness it probably WAS cancelled too soon (it was axed REALLY fast). Having said all of that, though, it was still bad.The casting was bad, the writing was way below average, the acting was bad and after a few weeks it wasn't showing any signs of getting better.I'm just curious as to how many episodes are on this DVD. From what I understand, 'Threshold' hadn't even shot a whole season. Are they just tossing out the eight or nine that made the air? Why would anyone buy what ammounts to (at best) 30% of a season?"
2,Poorly done,"Every minute characters in this series try to remind you of some plot point explained a short time ago. Watch this and your life will pass by quicklier than already does. Two or three nice ideas, the rest is very superficial and underutilized. Probably there was an exec there that keeped destroying the good work of other people. What I would do with a tenth of the budget of this misfire!!UPDATE: Thanks for the comments, not always my mind is at his best. The series is still pretty bad. Btw: phonetics in English are very different from phonetics in Spanish and Hebrew (and so ""couch"" becomes ""coach""). If I don't write in Word (with spelling capabilities) I'm pretty lost sometimes."
3,"Interesting idea, but plots were too much of a stretch","I generally am pretty forgiving of SciFi series, but this one... while based on an interesting premise was too prone to do the 'Star Trek thing' send in the top brass to dangerous situations with no back-up and never the right equipment. I found that simply too visible a fault to enjoy the shows."
4,Relegated to Fan fiction (sigh),"One thing that I liked about this show was that it had an interesting idea: invade the planet using sound to rewire DNA. Good ideas totally click or totally bomb. The delivery could have been a little better, but the writers never provided a sense of hope. There is a fair amount of fan fiction on the net which should help the die hard fan."
4,Good Story Line & Great Potential,"I enjoyed watching this series, but was disappointed to learn that it was cancelled after its first season. The potential of the series was huge. The story line was interesting with its twists and turns. Sci-fi fans should enjoy this season of Threshold."
4,never-ending saga,"Almost never-ending simply because this is just the first and the last season, hence the lack of proper ending. If this kind of thing bothers you then Threshold is not for you.It is captivating, especially at the beginning as towards the end it becomes too unbelievable. From time to time I caught myself wondering whether producers actually knew where it was all going or were they just making it up as they went along. Really, the kind of epidemic that this series is talking about cannot be stopped by the few confused scientsists, hence the struggle to come up with escalating threats but at the same time make them solvable. Its still very enjoyable but there are better alien-threat-related series out there ( for example Taken, although it has a completely different take on the problem )."
5,Hardly given a chance to bloom,"I'm not a real fan of science fiction, so I was suprised to find myself enjoying the show; I only watched it to see Peter Dinklage. The show was well written, the acters were wonderful, I enjoyed where the plot was going... it's unfortunate it was cancelled before it had a chance to really show it's stuff. Obviously, the ending isn't that great, since they had to rewrite it days before filming it, but I strongly recommend the show to any sci-fi fan out there, and to many who otherwise aren't."
3,A good extension of an established storyline,"I have to admit, when I first heard of the show it seemed like a blatent rip-off of the movie Sphere. Well, it is a rip-off of the story concept, but it remains a well done series. The same framework exists - a group of diverse scientists gathered for a first contact situation in the middle of the ocean, but the story is treated with a lot more development than Sphere. They had a season to explore various aspects of the alien site and develop the characters involved. If you're a fan of alien-based sci-fi stories, you'll enjoy this series."
5,Germinated in days and grows quickly!,"I ran out of this grass half way thru a large sandy ""patch"" I tilled over in my backyard. I had to purchase Vigoro from home depot to finish the other half. Let me tell you, it is night and Day the difference!!!! This grass is thick and bright green, the vigoro still hasnt even fully germinated in over 2 weeks, very thin sprouts and very patchy. I dont think I will use anything else now, especially if I need to establish a new area!"
1,"OLD, OUTDATED GRASS SEED","I bought this grass seed because I had not seen the brand before, and the description of it sounded great! Unfortunately, the grass seed did not grow - after many weeks, it is still sitting there, doing nothing. I checked the bag, and guess what? It is labeled 2010 - no wonder! very disappointed in this purchase."
2,"Disappointing, then a really awful climax","I thought the main character was different and sympathetic, but that the author was too heavy handed in her other characterizations. It really went quickly downhill in the climax, as the solution to the plot problem involves us suddenly believing that the super intelligent and powerful aliens are now as gullible as a bunch of 3rd graders."
4,Complex and compelling,The Fresco is both complex and compelling. Interesting concepts and characters kept me reading. While not my favortie book from Tepper it is still better than many other writers.
1,A painful read,"I am a big Tepper fan and so was even more disappointed in this book than if it had just been some random paperback I picked up in an airport. Wanting to put it down around page 100, I kept reading, thinking it had to get better sometime, but it just got worse and worse. Strangely, Tepper has the ability to make seemingly bizarre worlds and people seem completely realitic and believable, but when she tries to write about the ""real"" contemporary America, the results are stilted, dull, and don't ring true. I wish I hadn't read this book."
2,Here we go again,"I'm getting quite tired of the polemics getting in the way of the story, the new ideas, and the characters.Whenever I read one of Tepper's new books, I have to go back to 'Grass' to get the taste out of my mouth."
1,Bad,Didn't help I already knew all of these knots I did not like this app at all but it had good knots
3,Wrong title,"Ian Wright is the most fun host of them all, but it's not all him on these two dvds.The title is off, because by definition Scandinavia includes Sweden, Norway and Iceland.The coverage of the Baltic states is far too short, almost nothing shown. Just as you get into watching the Talinn bit, it's over. Norway and Sweden are covered well, I'm guessing. I'drecommend to purchase a separate DVD for the country of interest, instead of hoping that ""Ultimate"" Sacndinavia covers it all, which it only attempts to do."
5,They need to update this book for 1998,"This book is amazing! Full of info, pictures, however it needs to be updated as it is almost 20 years old."
4,Great ending for a great series,"I have read all the books in the Blood series and have enjoyed them all. I loved Vicki, Henry and Mike as characters and I think the storylines were interesting and well written. This final book in the series did a good job tying up loose ends and giving us some kind of closure for the characters. I think Ms. Huff has a great future as a writer and I look forward to more of her work."
3,WARNING! Kindle version cut off - incomplete!,"I've enjoyed this series - it's a fun, and often funny, set of paranormal mysteries.However, the Kindle edition has a more pressing mystery: where did the other half of the book go?? The Kindle version of Blood Debt cuts out halfway through the story, leaving the reader hanging.I submitted this to Customer Service when I first bought the book, but it looks like the problem still isn't fixed, 10 months later."
1,The Dumbest Book I have Ever Read,"I love vampire books as much as the next vampire fanatic but this book is atrocious. I have never read anything as stupid... as ""Blood Debt"" by Tanya Huff. A vampire being haunted by ghosts of victims of mysterious murders is the lamest plotline I have ever saw. What made this book even more stupid was the rules that Henry Fitzroy and Vicki Nelson has to follow. I guess not everyone can write as well as Anne Rice, and Tanya Huff is proof of that theory however is it so hard to write decent dialogue than the ... I read in this book? Is that too much to ask for? I think I'll go read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" again."
2,Very very bland...,"(Spoiler warnings)Although I enjoyed the past 4 books in this series, this book really grated on me. In the past, Victory's fights with Henry and the others were amusing and bordered at times on annoying. This time, however, they were exremely annoying.Secondly, Henry sounded more like an annoying [...] than the charming, delightful prince I'd come to love and admire.Thirdly, that a seasoned homicide policeman like Celluci would know less about forensics than an ex-policewoman was just dumb.Last, why do I have the feeling that the twist in the previous book(that is, the ending) was written so there'd be a second spin-off series? If so, clever marketing but what a horrible thing. It'd have been much better to leave Victory and Henry together, than drive them apart!At this point, I'm reading halfway through the book. I'm not even sure if I can finish it. And, I don't even know if I can finish the book without ripping the pages apart."
3,Only fair - too cookbook,"I was a little disappointed in this book. After reading the previous reviews, I expected something a little different. It was good for pointing out different situations that require setting boundaries (which adult children definitely need,) but it's very situation/response oriented which I found somewhat limiting in its usefulness. It does offer some tools that can give you strength in dealing with difficult situations. Some of their examples are pretty lame. For example, ""You know, Susan, that felt sort of shaming. Are you trying to say that my choice of clothes isn't classy enough for you?"" It was also somewhat cute-sie. Overall it was helpful but had it's limitations."
3,Not as good as i thought it would be...,A lot of good information but too general in nature... needs more interesting stories about the problems and how to remedy them.
4,very good but could be expanded,"This book is very good. I wish it covered a few more topics, but over all very helpful. I would most definately recommend it and plan to keep it handy in my collection."
1,"Not Useful, Barely Comprehensible Format","A year or so ago I bought a bunch of self-help books blindly online, with the hope they would represent their titles and be of some use to me personally.Of them, this is the weirdest. It consists of numerous chapters that are only one or two pages long each! That alone is a very strange format, but the content tends to be very uninformative and strange. I'm definitely of the opinion that self-help theories should be elaborated on, that's why one buys a self-help book, isn't it? But the author rambles, introduces new buzzwords at will, and there is none of the sort of elaboration or system here someone who is looking for help would want. Save your money and look for leading recommended books for your problems."
3,Not what I hoped,"These are okay but were a little cheaper-looking and more gimmicky than I hoped. I gave these as a present and felt a little funny because they almost looked like plastic. I think it might be because the metal is brushed. They look better when they are on the shirt than they do in the box (look like buttons), however."
5,Well Written and a Good Story.,"This was my first read by this author and I was impressed. It was well written with a good story line. I'll be looking for more of her books in the future. In fact, I'm anxious to get the next book, In A Cowboys Embrace, the story about Cliff. Can't wait to see his reaction to Ella and Bryant, along with hearing more about what's going on in their lives."
2,These are horrible..,"The bag it's self is very flimsy and the stitching that holds the cord is extremely sub par. The stitching is one stitch, and way too easy to break. The cord is okay but the piece that is supposed to clamp down on the cord sucks, it doesn't grip and it is also very cheap material that easily broke. The first time I used this bag it kept falling off of the stand since the clip won't hold the cord tightly and then the poor sewing broke and the whole thing was useless. DO NOT BUY THIS"
4,A little disappointed,"I purchased a necklace and earring set from Augustine Jewelry, so I thought I would buy this bracelet to complete the set for my wife. I'm no jeweler, but the quality does not seem to compare to the other set, even though they are both rated as AAA. The color of the pearls doesn't match as well as the necklace and earrings.AAA Quality 18 Inch Round 6.5-7mm White Akoya SaltWater Cultured Pearl Necklace & Earrings Set"
2,discretion,"The seller doesn't understand this, but the publisher printed this book in such a way that it can be played completely through with the piano alone (even though guitar & vocal are present).That seems fair, since the song breaks from the piano to guitar towards the end ... HOWEVER, they modified the true, original piano score. In many places, it bursts into redundant chords and fluffy syntax."
4,Their First Album,"This was Aaron*Jeoffrey's first album. It's not quite as strong as their other albums, but everyone has to start somewhere. Their harmony's are always spot on, and the lyrics always strong, but this album is probably only for big fans of A*J. Look for the original version of Some Kind of Lady on this album."
5,"Amazing music, beautifully played","Messiaen's music is a wonder, so complex and yet so grounded in its conception, and in its way, lyrical: it invites us to think of other worlds. In this recording, Jennifer Bate has done it yet again, with accurate, focussed and eloquent playing of this very ambitious repertory. Let us remember that these recordings have great significance as having been made with Messiaen's supervision and approval, yet as being of greater sonic quality than his own recordings of his music. Bravo!"
3,How can you know if its working?,"There's no way to find out if this filter is actually working, it's a matter of faith I guess. What I can say is that the article arrived in time and I had no payment issues what so ever."
3,filter,"not too happy with this product, no instructions, not that I really needed it but it would be nice to know about the o rings"
5,a product that works,The product works as advertised. It doesn't reduce pressure and it greatly lowers the chlorine content of the water so it doesn't burn your eyes or damage your hair.
2,Plastic Housing Springs Leaks,This is a wonderful filter if you opt for the meatal housing unit as the plastic unit is likely to spring a leak like mine did. I bought the unit in March 2011 and the unit sprang a leak in mid July 2011 - of course it is a total hassle to return now. The filter works great just remember to opt for the metal housing from the start and save yourself from wasting time and money and from the irritation of the plastic unit springing a leak.
5,So much better,My son and I noticed the dramatic improvement of our skin and hair with our replacement filter installed. We must have been way overdue on changing the filter. So happy the replacement filter arrived so quickly and works so well. Worth the investment big time! Changing the filter takes less than 5 minutes as our setup doesn't require any tools.
3,"Relative, everything is relative...","If I had this CD-ROM at High School, I would have been happy. It covers many High School level Biology such as meiosis, DNA and cell organels almost as good as Microsoft's Encarta Encyclopedia (if not as good as Encarta.) However, this CD-ROM provides more animations than Encarta does. Therefore, I would rate this CD-ROM as a 4 star for highschool.However, if you are interested in something more complex... biochemistry pathways, reaction mechanisms, etc. This CD-ROM is not exactly for you to learn new concepts... yet it would be a good product to review highschool biology; hence, it would be a 2 star for a college student.If you try the quiz, it is somewhat dissapointing at first (the first question was: ""Why are atomic number integers""); however, the last questions are good (topics on C4 photosynthesis.)I give this CD-ROM a 3 star because is the average between hs perspective and college perspective. =)"
1,Be very weary,"I have the last model, the MX35 and in the first year it had 3 motherboards replaced and various other issues that sent it to the shop over 8 times. This included random shutdowns. Since it has been just over 14 months since I purchased the computer, it is no longer under the 1 year warranty through Toshiba and now it is having an operating system failure which Circuit City will not fix even though I have the two year extended warranty. I've spoken with Toshiba multiple times and think I must have a lemon but they will not help. Right now I have a $1200 bookend. I will buy another laptop but it will not be a Toshiba. As a testament to the failure rate of the laptops, the Toshiba worker that I spoke to today let me know that there is a class action lawsuit about the computers and that a settlement will be reached soon."
1,Chances of getting a lemon are high,"I've only had my notebook for 3 months and in this time period I've had the notebook shutdown from overheating, drive errors, files constantly becoming corrupt, program failure, and drive failures. I've sent in the notebook twice now to be repaired only to recieve it a week later. It works fine for 5 minutes then all the problems happen all over again. What really bugs me is that whenever I call the support center the supposed ""expert"" has me go through repair steps I've done several times before I call them for help. I'm never buying a product from Toshiba again since all they sell are subpar products and refuse to acknowledge their poor performance."
1,DON'T BUY THIS NOTEBOOK,"I bought this notebook and it is completely broke. It went 4 times to the repair center indicaed by Toshiba and they were not able to fix the problem (it is under warranty). Since April, I have a total useless notebook. Problem: computer shuts dow, a blue screen appears saying that a problem occurred and windows was shut down to prevent damages. Do a Google search and you will see that several Toshiba computers have this problem. Don't buy it, you will have problems as I had and Toshiba will keep suggesting that you bring notebook to a repair center until warranty expires...."
4,Good value for money,"It is powerful, a good value for a price below $1500. Some minor problems with the screen."
5,Excellent Notebook!,"I always do a lot of research when I buy a new computer. Toshiba (and Apple) got the best rating for quality with the least amount of major repair problems. Beyond that though, I have owned a number of Toshiba notebooks and have had almost no problems. I considered Sony, but for the same power, I would have had to pay much more. Beside, why would I want to pay for something with less of a quality rating?As for this notebook. This is simply one of the most powerful notebooks for the money. The resolution is great, fast and quiet Centrino processor, the 1 Gig of RAM makes a significant difference, the video driver is powerful, the hard drive is maybe too big, the Super DVD drive is a great bonus too.If you are look for the best bang for the buck, buy this machine."
1,Too many problems for this price,"I would not recommend to buy this laptop. Here are the problems I got right after I bought my Toshiba Satellite M45-S355:1. Built-in network card freezes for 10-15 seconds every 5 seconds. Very difficult to download big files or listen to on-line radio. Techsupport recommended downloading and installing different network card driver. Did not help.2. CD/DVD drive does not read burned on HP Laptop TDK and some other brands disks. Any other old and new computers I tried could read those disks without any problems. Techsupport recommended using only SONY blank media. This is a bad advice.3. Sometimes, after staying idle for more than 30 minutes my laptop won't shut down normally. The only way to shut it down is just to unplug it."
4,Celtic Music at it's Best,"If your looking for a nice celtic cd, then this is it. Rankin Family does celtic music like no other. They have a balance of slow and up beat selections, and do them all with style. This is definatly a great CD to pick up."
5,At Last!,"I had purchased this album years ago whle visiting Nova Scotia and it immediately became my favorite. The entire album is absolutely awsome, not a bad song in the bunch! Alas, I had lost my cd while moving and FINALLY found it again on this site. THANK YOU!!! HAPPY AGAIN!!!"
5,celtic perfection,"The Rankin Family is the obvious choice for pure celtic music unadulterated by commercial input. If you love celtic fiddling and guitar, it is here as well! I cannot pick a favorite album of theirs. They are all truly wonderful!"
1,A great down-home folksome album,"Now boys and girls.. gather 'round the fire. It's chilly out there, so let's warm ourselves with our voices and fiddles. And Ukeleles. And Kazoos. And Harmonicas. And geeetars.The album sure left me speechless! Never before have I had the opportunity to hear such a wide variety of groovin' tunes. Here's an album that'll help y'all get down with yer funky selves. Now clap along everyone! The Rankin Family's a comin' and they're bringin' a trainload of goopy nostalgia and folksy yet weary melodrama. Tell my ma when I get home, I wish the Rankins would leave me alone!"
4,old dutch rooster twine holder with twine red,"i like this item, it is well made. i have it setting on the counter and covered the twine with plastic to keep it clean."
3,The heat is on,"Responding to the apparent lack of concern when a young black kid is murdered, report Lane Montgomery decides to write a little follow up article about him. Quickly she becomes entangled in the murder investigation as she finds that things just don't add up. As she follows the path, she keeps encountering Ann Alexander, her rival reporter. They still have feelings for each other and despite their professional roles as adversaries, they cannot deny their mutual desire. Both of the murder investigations they are investigating seem to have more in common than they initially thought, but who will scoop the big story first? ""She Scoops to Conquer"" is a fun and sexy romantic thriller in what is hoped is just the beginning of a new series."
1,How Bad is Bad?,"Pretty bad. This ""thing"" appeared to be raw footage captured by a rank amateur who could not (1) focus, (2) follow action, (3)zoom or pan, and (4) edit. At all.I have seen professionally produced videos of the Sambodromo and, until now, I thought some were a bit poorly produced. They were magnificent compared to this thing.Save your time, save your money, save your sanity. Amazon really needs a ""no star"" rating for something this awful."
1,Sambodromo 2008,Video images are good but sound is extra poor in quality. Sound can't almost be heard and there is a lot of noise around
1,MAN PLEASE!!!!!!,first off all the sudden bow wow can start saying that he is a thug on songs??????? this just aint right. homeboy is startin to lose it in his new album. The kid used to rap to this little kid stuff and can all the sudden release an album trying to act like he is from the streets?? he has been rich since he was 12 or something! bow wow needs to drop out cuz he aint cuttin itcop that chamillionaire joint if you want some rap for real
1,Worst album of the year,"Yep hands down. This album is by far the worst piece of garbage to come out of the rap industry this year and it may even be the worst album to come out of the music industry in general. People this isn't rap, this is crappy pop music designed for the under 10 audience. What is even more hillarious is that this fool is actually trying to act gangsta by crip walking and throwing up gang signs. This moron is far from gangsta and wouldn't last a second in a real hood. And how the hell is he gangsta with his bubblegum lyrics and corny videos? He's a joke and nothing but a joke. I don't know what Snoop was smoking when he put this clown on, and it figures that he'd be affiliated with Jermaine Durpri since he also sucks."
1,Awful,"This album is totally LAME! Anyone who likes this album is only into generic, boring sex rap we hear everyday. Only ONE good song, ""Let Me Hold You"". The only other okay song is ""Like You"", Li' Bow Wow sucks. Ciara's verse is amazing, tho. DON'T BUY."
2,not very good,"He couldve done better than what he did im losing respect for him not only b/c his attitude is changing and hes starting to become and arrogant cocky jerk but because he only wrote one song on this new album, co-wrote it at that how can you call yourself 'the best' and u aint even writing ya own material bw is starting to become a joke and if he keeps actin this way and doing what hes doin hell fall off in a couple years...bad album-not the best he couldve done weak lyrics alright beats-maybe 2 or 3 good songs..."
5,WAY better than Unleashed.....,"Yeah, this is a good cd, much better than his last cd ""Unleashed"". Now, I really think this should be an explicit cd, not that I care but....But yes, this was his break-through cd and I would buy it definitely. If he wants to be a very popular rapper, hes got it going for him.I would defitnely buy this, you wount regret it."
1,Wanted: For wack rhymes!!!!!!!,"I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a ""hip hop teeny bopper"". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should."
4,TO BE HONEST.....I THOUGHT THIS CD WAS GOING TO SUCK!,Bow Wow's cd was actually good. When it first came out and i saw the cover i seriously thought it was going suck...BIG TIME! But when i got it for a gift I was bumpin' that cd everyday. The only reason why I put four stars is because the album could use a couple of more songs and bow wow needs to lower the cocky level. BUT STILL BOW WOW IS SEXY AS EVER!!!!
4,My Review,"I like this cd, because it is crunk. I listen to it everyday when I have time. It is the best cd that Bow Wow has made. He has already sold many copies. He has alot of talent to make music, but mu favorite song is Like You feat. Ciara. I really rrecommend this cd to those that like hip-hop and r&b"
1,Bow Wow is garbage,"Bow Wow is nothing more than a big joke. True rap fans don't listen to his corny pop songs. This is garbage, all the songs suck and there is nothing good here. This isn't rap this is pop for little kids. If you want good rap, get yourself some G-Unit, Eminem, Dipset, Black Rob, Three Six Mafia, Lil Wayne, Chamillionaire ect. Not this pop non-sense. If you like listening to Hilary Duff or Ashlee Simpson, than by all means get this. If your like me and hate bubblegum garbage rap like what Bow Wow makes, than steer clear of this."
1,Proof of the dumbing down of music! No-talent garbage!,"C'mon! This dude is a grandiose gimmick, straight up. Most of his fans are kiddies and pimply tweens, and he is the hip-hop/rap equivalent of Britney Spears or Jessica Simspon are to mainstream pop music. Old school and other real rappers must be cringing at this bastardized, diluted crap! But Bow Wow is laughing all the way to the bank, livin' like a king with his bling!"
4,Bow Wow: Wanted?,"[Lil'] Bow Wow is back, but is it his best? Hooking back up with J.D. was clearly a wise move, from a production point of view, and Bow Wow still can put it down on the mic, however, he seems like he still hasn't ""found"" his style. To be fair, Bow Wow is clearly in caught in the difficult process of ""jumping"" from the teeny bopper realm to the adult realm. Personally, I think he will succeed, but for now, we have to settle for this: 2 excellent tracks , 2 good tracks, 6 mediocre tracks, and 1 poor track.I used the following rating system, with each song worth 5 points, for a total of 55 points:1. Do You - 3/52. Big Dreams - 5/53. Let Me Hold You - 5/54. Fresh Azimiz - 4.5/55. Caviar - 3/56. Like You - 4/57. B.O.W. - 3/58. Go - 2/59. Do What It Do - 3/510. Is That You (P.Y.T) - 3/511. Mo Money - 3.5/539/55 = 70.9% = 3.55/5 stars (rounded to 4 stars for rating purposes)"
4,Bow Wow best album,"I think this is Bow Wow's best album of his career. I couldn't wait until he grew up and stopped appealing to little kids. He has growed up and that is just something his fans and haters are going to have to accepted. No matter how much people hate on him I bet this album will come out on top, selling more than any other. So all you haters that don't like the album stop hating and GROW UP like Bow wow!!"
1,CIARA PLEASE BREAK UP WITH THIS LOOSER,"WHAT CIARA THINKS WHEN SHE GET OUT WITH BOW WOW ? CIARA IS OLDER,TALLER AND SHE CAN SING-BOW WOW CANT RAP!LET ME HOLD YOU IS OKAY AND THE ONLY TRACK I REALLY LIKE IS LIKE U 'CAUSE OF CIARA.I DONT KNO' WHAT JD DID HE MAKES HOT TRACKS FOR NIVEA,MARIAH,................!BUT THIS ONE IS shhh!BOW WOW TAKE PLEASE A JOINT FROM LIL JON ,THE NEPTUNES AND U GONNA BE HOT AND MORE TRACKS WITH RNB STARS LIKE CIARA!TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES BLACK MUSIC DONT GET THIS DONT SPEND UR MONEY AND TIME FOR THIS!BUY TEAIRRA MARI SHE IS HOTwas this review helpful to you ?"
2,Time to Get Real,"Okay, people might not undastand, but a good rapper and a rapper everyone wants to hear basically depends on his background, u know wurr he's from. I wuz like hey when he wuz young his album wuz cool for da smaller kids or whateva, but know he's grown, and the best rappin grown men come from da rough and grimy streets, and even if they don't they have had some sort of struggle to get wurr dey are today. I'm sorry but LITTLE BOW WOW comes from OHIO. He was on every since he wuz born, he knows nothin about real life. HE's been in da studio since he wuz a baby for pete's sake. Time to get real SHAD get out in da real world a learn somethin about life. Only songs to listen too are his collabos with O and CIARA, and he has one with J-Kwon on da hook, I really suggest u bootleg dis CD. Oh by da way I'm only 17 and I don't like his music, so don't think all teenagers do. HOLLA at Ya BOI"
3,He's not lil' any more,"When bow wow first started, he didn't rap about getting girls and stuff like that. But it has changed. Bow wow is 18 now and his rapping isn't terrible, but is not at the point of being a rapping legend. He has matured and is starting to rap like every other rapper, getting girls and having alot of money like what most rappers are talking about in their songs. People were wondering when he would rap about these kinds of stuff, and this is the album. Showing to the people that he's not lil' anymore"
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I never bought a Bow Wow Album before but when his first song Bow Wow (yippe yp yippie Ya) or whatever came out I loved it and the first single off unleashed was good, but not good enough to get me to buy the Cd. This time around I got the CD cuz i was convinced he'd grown up...Not really. The three good songs are ""Big Dreams"" ""Let Me Hold you"" and ""Like You"". If you want a good rap CD get Tupac, Nelly, 50 Cent, G- Unit, JA Rule, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Lloyd Banks, The Game. Save yourself $12 and just download these 3 songs on ITunes or Wal-Mart because they are really good but the rest of the album sucks."
1,Fake thug,"Bow wow is 18 and all of a sudden he is cursing on his records, got tattoos and trying to act like athug, but the problem is he not from the streets. But getting back to the album, the only 2 decent tracks are Let me hold you and Like you amd only because of Omarion's and Ciara's guest vocals, the 3rd single Freshazimiz is generic topic on which other people did a better job rapping, the rest of the album is garbage. How is he gonna say that that this album is on par with Illmatic i will never be able to answer, bottom line is bow wow never was a thug, if anyone is a bubblegum rapper its him, and what with all the people talking about him growing up lyricaly when he does not writes his rhymesP.S. Finally Ciara smartened up and dumped him"
2,Worse than i expected,"now im not a little Bow Wow hater, dont get me wrong i've actually baught all his albums, and at times i've defended him. but other than like you, let me hold you, and freshazimiz, this cd is pretty wack. His worse release yet. If you've heard his other albums but haven't heard this one, trust me, you dont wanna hear it. Not Bow wow's best work, but keep tryin lil bow weezy, keep trying to hold it down in the rap game. Also his respect level with me dropped since what he said about Will Smith, a dude of bow wow's calibur has no right to say what he said about an acting and hip hop legend"
2,parental sticker,"this album needs a parental sticker. ""bow wow? dont you know youre dating a man?"". save your damn money you foolish little girls."
1,commercial rap poser,"Bow Wow: How dare you call Will Smith a bubblegum rapper? Look in the mirror dawg, by the time you're his age you'll be forgotten, the only thing keeping your career alive from Ciara, go back to school and get a real job 'cause acting like you're a legit entertainer is failing you so far, if you appreciate the artistry of entertainment stay away from this junk...."
1,I think he needs a pad and a pen.,"As another person mentioned, I am no where near a bow bow hater. I remember feeling some type of way about liking him when he was younger because I seldom dig commercial rap. So now he's all grown up and doing his thing. He had a couple of hits.One day I'm online reading about this guy hating on Will Smith and I later learned that this guy doesn't even write his own music. WHAT?!Are you kidding me. No matter who the remarks was to, one cannot disrespect another rapper when they don't even write their own music.After hearing that I was just done. How can you rate his music when he is not writing it? What are we rating his sound over the music because he has no connection with it.I think it was just ok.""Fresh as I am"" was hot. I was really feeling that sound. I like ok, he's all grown up and showing people what he is made up but again later I learned he didn't write it....lol..that'f funny. Is this how Jermain Dupri feels?Can the real rapper please stand up."
1,bow wow is the tru bubble gum rapper,"Aight whats real is the fact that this album sucked. I think that i am now officially allergic to any bow wow albums. I have completely given up on the kid. That kid completely stepped over the line by hatin on will smith (who by the way won the first ever RAP GRAMMY!) and called him a ""bubble gum rapper"" thats funny, 4ft2in LIL bow wow is the most commercial and fake rapper out there. Freshazimiz yeah bow you real hard. You got tattoos, and grillz, if anybody is a bubble gum rapper its you. This cat comes out with the same songs on every single album he put out. you got two songs for the ladies, who only support him cuz they think he cute. you get 3 songs about him braggin bout what he got, and what you dont. And them the 3-4 songs about him tryn act hard. this cd is possibly one of the worst ive ever heard. Bow should have just sticked to letting JD write his stuff. Stay away from this album. its wack as hell."
1,wanted for making piece of trash,man this guy should be locked up.man what kind of garbage is this.all you girls in my school said this album beats all the g-unit cds. that i likewow g-unitwanna hear my rap against a young white bloind girlyo ever since the idiot on bet the 106 and bobut today im taking 106 and homan this trick is crazy wit them hips and she sickbut she look like one of the b*tches from white chicksdont trip.

3,Overall good,"There are no shockers here... the beats are alright, and the lyrics are good, he's always been good with them, but it's a bit redundant. There's only so much desire to hear about how good a person is, or how long he's been in the game. I like his desire to branch out a bit with Big dreams, and he keeps with his hip-hop ballads, which work well for him and his audience. Very LL in that sense. I think that the older he gets, it'll be better... usually I hate people mentioning his age, but the truth is that, at his age, what he's rapping about is appropriate... taking a semester or two in college might be good for him, give him a bit of life experience outside of the hip-hop recording world, give him a chance to know a bit more. However, good flow throughout..."
1,commercial rap posing,"It's funny how Bow Wow could call Will Smith a bubblegum rapper when he never has had a Grammy or an Oscar nomination in his career and he never will if he keeps on putting out garbage albums like this along with his cheesy movies!!! Please Bow Wow quit entertaining, you're an embarassment to the industry, just go to school and be somethin' else, from the famous words of Will Smith: ""Pump Ya Brakes""!!!"
1,Disappointment!!!!,"This CD is garbage. When i first heard (let me hold u) i thought it was a nice song. Then when he came out with (like you) Ciara, i liked that one to so i thought maybe the CD was good. I was wrong, those were the only 2 songs that were good on the whole album. All his songs are about what he got,(nobody cares). I'm just waiting for the day a ""REAL"" rapper blows him out the water and help him realize he ""can't rap""."
2,"He's got JD on his beats, so i couldnt just give him 1 star","Lil Bow Wow, excuse me, Bow Wow has shown a little growth on his latest cd, but it's still all but deep or influential in any way. His topics might a little more mature, but trust- it's still for the kids. It's basically for the same fans he has always had, since they've grown up with him (just a little bit tho). Other than that, the hit ""Let Me Hold You"" featuring Omarion and the next one called ""Like You"" featuring Ciara are cool- the rest are album fillers."
5,This book should be made a compulsory school text!,"I am a privileged owner of the 1961 edition of this book, having bought it in a jumble sale in 1984 for a mere Singapore 70 cents (less for U.S.). Open-ended & with great science projects, this book defies obsolescence and is a must for any parent/nation committed in honing young minds into the field of experimental biology and science.With this book, William Berman leaves a legacy which plays surrogate to any young inquiring mind wishing for the most inspiring biology teacher.To William Berman...Thanks!"
3,How To Dissect,"I used this book in my homeschool dissection club and found that it is a good reference tool, but lacks a thorough description of the internal anatomy. The diagrams of the internal anatomy are also very vague. This book is best used with online dissecton diagrams and instuctions. In a nutshell, this book came in handy every time I dissected, but only after I had a complete understanding of the internal anatomy of the specimen from other sources."
2,Needs Some Serious Updating,"I'm sure this was a great book for 2003 and while many things are still relevant, it is way behind the current wave of technology. It screams, ""please revise me!"". I ordered this not realizing the date it was written (my bad). However, if a new revision came out today, I'd be right there in line for it. I guess from now on I will need to make sure that the title has ""Ubuntu"" in it."
5,best travel item I've owned,"I've had this pillow for almost 5 years and bought another one for my wife about 3 years ago. I am in the military and have traveled around the world with this pillow and won't leave home without it. In my experience, the tempur pedic brand is by far the best memory foam you can purchase and far outperforms any other options. This can be rolled up into a neck pillow or opened up for a great sleeping pillow. The initial price may seem high but the overall value is outstanding and worth every penny. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,An excellent language method,"That's the second installment of the Pimsleur Language Program Japanese.There are two very strong points to the method. One, that distinguishes it from anyother is the fact that everything is done orally. I thought I could only memorise by reading. This method proved me wrong. And with nowdays technology, from the ipod to any PDA or Pocket PC, this turns into a huge advantage as you can practice while being in the taxi, the tube or department stores.The complementary quality of the method is the excellent choice of vocabulary. I have reach lesson 25 of Japanese II and I still do not know how to say the dog in Japanese, which pretty much any other method would teach you in lesson one. They teach you how to count, to express temporal and spatial concepts, to manage schedule, to speak about your family and they insist on collocial expressions. This proves to be the most useful vocabulary for the average corporate person and most of modern citizens. Well done."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought one in November 2004. Last week while I was in the room, carefully monitoring it, it started throwing sparks for no reason. I'm lucky that I was nearby to turn it off & unplug it or my home would have caught on fire.This one was very poorly assembled. The elements have also been loose where they connect to the ceramic fixtures. This will be the last one of this type, I will buy. If you need a portable heater, stay with a total ceramic type, or a radiant quartz heater."
3,Get it because it's cheap,"This CD is a good cheap collection of 80s songs. The unifying theme is that they were all released under the RCA label (""Nipper"" refers to the dog in the RCA logo), and they all made it into one chart or another. It's certainly not easy to listen to straight through. Songs were taken from country and pop charts, and the arrangement of songs seems to be specifically designed to alternate selections from the two disparate charts. Where else can you hear ""Funkytown"" lead into a tears-in-my-beer country lament?Let's face it. You probably would only want it because it has one or two songs you like and you can't find them anywhere else. So your main concerns are whether the sound quality is good and whether the songs appear in their entirety. On that basis, this disc is good. If you're making your own 80s collection for the car, this disc is a good source to record from. Its worth beyond that is debatable."
3,Track Listing & Comments,"The Amazon listing apparently shows the songwriter, not the group, thus this listing:1. 9 to 5 - Dolly Parton2. Guitar Man - Elvis Presley3. Jessie's Girl - Rick Springfield4. Love in the First Degree - Alabama5. Hooked on Classics I and II/Piano Canerto No. 1/Flight of the... - Royal Philharmonic Orchestra6. Just to Satisfy You - Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson7. Nobody - Sylvia8. Maneater - Hall & Oates9. Puttin' on the Ritz - Taco10. Dare Me - The Pointer Sisters11. We Built This City - Starship12. Broken Wings - Mr. Mister13. The Way It Is - Bruce Hornsby & the Range14. 80's Ladies - K.T. Oslin15. Funkytown - Pseudo Echo16. You Snap Your Fingers (And I'm Back in Your Hands) - Ronnie Milsap17. Waiting for a Star to Fall - Boy Meets GirlThis version of Funkytown charted in 1987. The original version, by Lipp's, Inc. charted in 1980 at Number 1."
3,GREAT 80'S POP WITH SOME NOT NEEDED COUNTRY THROWN IN!,"This is a very good cd. It features some of my all time favorite hits of the 1980's such as Hooked On Classics and Puttin On The Ritz and such pop classics as 9 To 5, Jessie's Girl and Maneater. all on one neat CD. It even features Elvis Presley's last hit to make the top 40 portion of The Bilboard Hot 100 Gutar Man. The Ronnie Milsap song should have been There's No Getting Over You not the one that is on this Cd! The Alabama song should have the Studio (hit) version! Waylon should have sang without Willie on Theme from Dukes Of Hazzard! and KT Osland Should have not even appeared on this cd. in summing up this cd the pop songs are some of the best of the 80's but the Country songs (the ones that didn't hit the pop charts) we could have done without!"
2,It's Got Those One-Hit Wonders,"This CD has a few great hits on it. I bought it because of Taco's version of ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" and ""Waiting for a Star to Fall,"" which at the time I could not find on any other compilation.As the other reviewers have said, the country songs were disappointing to me. I would have rather had more pop songs. When I want country music, I'd like a whole CD of that. Nonetheless, this is a welcome addition to my collection for the sole purpose of making mix CDs for those long car rides. It's better than buying an entire CD of Boy Meets Girl or Taco for those two individual songs. I also thought the ""Hooked on Classics I and II"" was a strange thing to put beween those two country songs. I think that should have been at the end. My two cents."
5,rooster string holder,Love the motif since I collect roosters and great organization piece in the Kitchen for my string and twine since I cook alot...Love the durability of the material being wrought iron and these are hard to find. I found it easy to assemble and compliments my kitchen nicely and my friends have even commented on this piece and the matching paper towel holder...Highly recommend.
4,Totable storytime,"Need a great travel toy for the car or plane. Your little one will love the Woodkins dress-up kids line. This toy includes fabric swatches in order to change the outfits as your little narrator changes the story. It also has interchangable faces to change the ""mood"" of the story. Comes in a cute little carrying tote as well. Definite must for the little traveler."
5,Elegance in a Can !,"This coffee is delicious , rich , smooth and robust ! Had it in Rome and was thrilled to see it on Amazon . This coffee does not disappoint !"
3,Not the same as in the cafe in Rome,"I have been addicted to Sant' Eustachio since I went to the cafe in Roma.I bought some cans there and brought home to the US with me and fortunately hadfriends who were frequently traveling to Italy and were able to continue my supply from afar.I would also find imports in New York City on occasion.When this became available online I was so excited and ordered 4 right away.I had a small amount left of my imported grind (hand delivered from Roma), and noticed that this versiondoes not has the same taste/flavor as the grind that I have gotten in the past.Just my personal observation. But, I am back to my Illy instead of this."
4,great toy,"My 6 month old daughter loves watching Jojo's circus so when I found Gloiath, I was thrilled. She loves to hold on to him and talk to him."
4,beautifully made,"I loved the seat covers that were supposed to fit my truck, but they didn't take into account that my seatbelts are built into my seat. I would have loved to have these in my truck! :("
2,"Looking for the vintage one, don't think so...","""Are you looking for devastator as you remember him from the good old times?? well this is not the one you saw. bonecrusher and scrapper are the same only different color, long haul and high tower as well, and in the original each and everyone of the were diferent. and there were six instead of 5. so if you want something that will wake your inner child don't buy this one."""
4,A REAL COWBOY,"FORMER DALLAS COWBOY RUNNING BACK WRITES THIS BOOK WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR AND SOME GOOD OLD BOY STORIES. WALT GARRISON IS A TRUE COWBOY (HE EVEN DID SOME STEER ROPING)IN THE RODEO. I ALWAYS REMEMBERED HIM DOING THE SKOAL COMMERCIALS WITH EARL CAMPBELL. WALT REALLY DOESN'T GO INTO ALOT OF SEASON BY SEASON RESULTS BUT DOES IT WITH A COLLECTION OF MANY FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING TALES ABOUT HIS FORMER FRIENDS AND TEAMATES. AMONG THE BEST ARE CONCERNING DANDY DON MEREDITH AND BOB LILLY. WALT WAS A FINE PLAYER AND I THINK HE DOES A GOOD JOB ON THIS BOOK. LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE REVIEWED THIS BOOK, I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL FOOTBALL FANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE COWBOYS OF THE LATE 1960'S AND 1970'S. A VERY EASY AND LIGHT BOOK TO READ."
1,Waiting Waiting... & more waiting.,"I had ordered Coaching to the Human Soul Ontological Coaching and Deep Change, Vol. 1Very excited to have this book and was willing to pay a premium to get it. Ordered July 26th with a shipping date of Aug 2-17. It is now Aug 21st and I have since contacted the seller 2x inquiring about the order and have yet to receive any reply.VERY DISAPPOINTED IN DENVER, COLORADO"
4,cute,"very nice and a year later still looks new...they look a little cheaper than i thought they would, but i get alot of compliments on them still and for the price it's a good deal...they're a little lighter than a london blue topaz, but still compliments my london blue topaz david yurman ring well."
3,works,"well what can I say; it is a plastic compost bucket.1 plus; if changed regularly it does not smell bad.1 bummer; if you wait till it fills up all the way, it smells so bad when opened you won't want to open it.works as promised nothing fancy..."
3,Nice Little Scrapbucket,"The service from the vendor was great, no complaints. The kitchen compositing bucket is alright. It's quite light-weight, and while putting the lid on, one of the little bracket-holders was nearly bent off (and I wasn't forcing it!). But it does the job so I don't have to make a trip to the backyard composter everytime I have scraps to put in! I didn't buy the biodegradable bags to go in it, either. I use regular paper bags which are compostable so when little bucket is full, the whole lot goes into the big bin in the yard!"
5,Great Gadget,"My wife loves this thing! She has recently got into Composting, and now we can keep all of our vegetable scraps, old coffee grounds, egg shells, etc., waiting to go to the Compost Bin, in the kitchen with out the odor! The Charcoal Filter really works, and we use the bio-degradeable bags which you can throw in with the compost. A really neat idea!"
4,Kitchen compost collector,This is working just fine for us. It is a bit large but the filters work fine and you don't have to run out in the cold to dump it very often. The lid is always attached which sometimes gets in the way but it's not a big deal.
4,No fumes in the kitchen!,"I am a city girl who has been transplanted to the rural Berkshires. I have a compost heap, the source of much amusement to my family, and hopefully the source of great compost for my perennials this Fall. My garbage cans are 60% less full than before and I love that this little bucket holds all the kitchen scraps until I can make my way to the pile and add them in. No fuss, no muss, no smells! Also, because I am so clumsy, I love that it's plastic and not porcelain!"
4,Great for a small kitchen,"This bucket is the perfect size for a 2-person household. We empty it about once a week, and the filter keeps odors under control.The bucket was easy to assemble and seems relatively durable."
4,Diamonds in the Rough,This is a very good book about different teams in the Alaska Baseball League. In talks about each team and their players and also talks of the history of the league.
5,A fantastic read,"What a book! Janet Brown's latest novel, A Kiss Is Just a Kiss, is also her best so far. A gripping story of relationships and discovery and conflict and maturation in the tumultuous 1960's, with a few paranormal elements thrown in as well. But the best part of Ms. Brown's novel is the enduring and bittersweet love story between a college student and her British professor. In fact, Plymouth Gardmore is one of the most complex and interesting fictional characters since Atticus Finch.This is a marvelous tale, guaranteed to keep you turning pages far into the night, and to stay in your thoughts long after the book is finished. It is one of those rare stories that is entertaining yet illuminating, fascinating yet believable.Whatever you do, buy this novel--But don't start it just before bedtime."
3,"Not a bad CD, but not a Great one either...","I absolutely love Avenue Blue, and was really excited that Jeff was going out on a solo project. But sadly I don't feel, in my humble opinion, the same sultry vibe as previous Avenue Blue cd's.The smoothness just wasn't there for me.Velvet Touch is a good track, but thats about it. Would I recommend this cd? Maybe...."
5,Excellent Educational book,"Book was ordered for a Master's course in Education. It is easy to follow and understandable. It is meant to be used with the other 2 books in the trilogy of ""What's worth fighting for..."". Interesting and practical, it discusses the subject of confronting current educational issues and how to turn things around in the direction that education has been going, in order for it to become what it is meant to be. It is also informative and to the point on how to get these possible changes put into place in today's world."
3,Yes ~ Live At Queens Park Rangers Stadium.......,Let me start by saying that it's always great to see such classic 70's rock bands such as Yes on video live in their prime... but why anyone would release a video of such a CLASSIC band such as Yes & not fix the flaws in the sound on here is beyond me... the sound problems on this video could have easily been fixed & done properly... Yes fans deserve better.... but it is still good to have...
2,"Good picture, bad sound","I'm not the first to mention this, but it is a real pity that this potentially great release is combined with a very band sound track. It should have been a warning on the sleeve. If I'm not mistaken, both disks have mono sound, and at least disk 1 seems to have only 1 stereo channel on both speakers. E.g. when Jon is playing some additional guitar parts, his notes are loud in the mix, while the interesting solo parts of Steve are hardly audible. And Alan is sometimes very busy drumming, but silent in the mix.For a true Yes fan, this is a must have, but it won't win new ones."
4,ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS!!!,ONE OF THE GREAT EARLY YES SHOWS' PART TWO WAS TOO EXSPENSIVE AT $34.IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE $22.
5,Return of a Classic,Elements is one of the best introductions to statistical inference and econometrics ever published. I still refer to my copy 14 years after finishing my degree. Can't say that about any other textbook
1,deceptive sales practices,"The seller's description stated that this book is a second edition. However, when I received it, I found out that it is a 1971 first edition which I cannot use at all for the class I am currently taking. I contacted them in order to return it. So far I have only received a partial refund and no instructions on how to return the book."
2,Nice piece selection but..,I do appreciate these works on the CD by a good technical player; however the inconsistant pitch and tone quality were a disappointment.
4,Hope for Peace among all People,"This human being, a Christian Palestinian, has through this biography given the world hope for what mankind has prayed for for over three thousand years, THE PEACE OF jERUSALEM. One should read it in bits and starts, taking time to examine present day circumstances and buried prejudices."
2,A little disappointing,"This book is a great, if you are not expecting to read about the actual conflicts that have riddled the middle east. But rather how one man deals with day to day problems that one faces if he is inspiring to become a priest, and happens to be from Palestine. HIS thoughts, HIS feelings, unfortunatly none of the true historical turning points are discussed in any depth. It makes for some great reading, and some nice biblical phrases are thrown in here and there."
5,Plano Choke Tube Box (Small),As always a Quality product from a Quality company. It will hold up to 6 chokes as described with room to spare. I only have 5 in this box right now- 4 normal length and my extended turkey choke which takes up almost all of 1 of the sections. The foam cushion at in the bottom holds the chokes against the lid so that they don't rattle or move. I think it beats my old system of putting the tubes in small bottles and then putting them in a pouch. And the lid snaps closed and stays that way. Over all a very good product.
4,Worth it!,Fits in jacket pocket and keeps the choke tubes and choke wrench lint free and available for use. Cheap insurance to insure don't get lost.
4,Good deal,"Needed something to put a few chokes in that wasn't too bulky. Fits extended chokes and the foam holds them tight, so no rattling around. I had to knock off a few of the edges of molding flash that were a little more sharp than I'd prefer. But, overall a great price for a compact case I can throw in my range bag and have multiple choke options for my 870 Tactical."
4,A pretty good buy,"For the price, this is a pretty good buy. I have 5 year old twins and one of them took to it like a duck to water. The other one had more trouble getting the hang of it. It's the perfect size for my kids and it's easy enough to pull back on the string. I especially like the arrows because they have a tiny notch on the end the keeps the arrow 'clicked' into the string. Since there is a lot happening at one time, having the arrow stay connected to the string makes it that much easier. I also like the fact that the bow can be used be both right and left handed children - since I have one of each. I was only disappointed with the fact that the bow only came with two arrows and to buy any extra ones seemed disproportionally expensive. I finally found a local archery store that sold extra arrows for a fraction of the price. All in all, I would recommend this as a first bow and arrow set."
3,No Target included,The description says there is a target include on the back of the package.No target was found on our package.
3,Alastair earns his living by writing.,"In this book Alastair Mars summarises British submarine operations in WW2. All significant actions get a mention. The book provides an interesting overview of the British submarine force during the war. Mars was himself a participant in some of those actions and he has added his own opinions to the text in several places. I find these interesting. It's not a bad book, but only someone interested in the subject will want to read it, and to such a person it will reveal nothing new."
2,Reliability and service problems,"I would echo the words to the wise from another reviewer here. I too bought a Slimtop. After 10 months the CDRW started acting up. I rang the Sony helpline, and from the voice prompt entered the model id, whereupon the voice system told me that it was out of warranty. Note - not just my machine, about which this voice system knew nothing (unless Sony are cleverer than their consumer products of course ;-), but the *entire model* was deemed out of warranty. And there was no way I could get through the system to a human being to discuss my problem. So I wrote them an e-mail describing this voice system weirdness, and my actual hardware problem. That was six months agho. Of course, I am still waiting for a response. So, my word to the wise is : if reliability or service are criteria in your purchasing decision, avoid Sony like the plague, because you will be on your own."
2,reliability & warranty problems,"A word to the wise on Sony's Vaio line: I purchased one of the Sony slimline computers a year ago and had a hard disk failure within the first 9 months. This was covered by the warranty, so Sony replaced the drive at their expense. The replacement drive failed in about 6 months (when it and the system were off warranty). When I replaced *that* drive I discovered that Sony had given me a used disk when it did the warranty work."
1,Ongoing H/W problems... non-existent tech support,"I purchased this computer in 2001 and within the first year the tablet/monitor failed totally... simply died. The warranty replacement was a poorly refurbished unit that was actually 'GLUED' together on a trim piece and the writing surface was marred by poor packaging. I did not accept that unit and the replacement to that unit was also a refurbished unit that remained intact for less than 6 months before faint random lines began to appear from the right edge of the tablet. Recently these lines grew very dark and to an unbearable total of 13. The tablet is now in for additional warranty service (fortunately, I purchased the extended warranty). I upgraded the PC to M/S XP pro and 512 memory. Aside from initial compatibility issues that have since been resolved, the PC has been stable... though there are dead spots on the HD for which the S/W has seemingly compensated. My advice... for the money or a lot less... you can do much better."
1,not a good buy,"This computer was obviously meant to appeal to those who are completely clueless about computers. My mom bought this computer i think because it looked nice. The parts are of poor quality, especially the video card, and you could buy a system with similar specifications without the LCD for about one third of the price. I have found no way to upgrade most of the parts, because they are non-standard, and I have not been able to get through to tech support. When i phone the line goes dead and when I e-mail i get an error. It's obvious Sony doesn't put much care or attention into their tech support."
1,Beware of product,"You will enjoy it, but not for long. I know at least a dozen of stories (mine included of course) of users who had problems either with black lines or lots of dead pixels on the monitor and also with their hard drives.If you want to draw digital style, you better get a professional pen tablet for a quarter of the cost of this computer that Sony just pretends never existed and ignores buyers complains."
4,Handy for Speical Purposes,"I use this light for spectroscopic work.When examining a potential purchase - wrap the specimen with flexible bluestik around the light end and you get an ideal projection through the material for analysis. Very handy, compact, portable - can be used on the spot at locations to verify you are getting what is represented."
4,flwx light okay,"I like the light, I use it for a back-up during road rallies. My only complaint is that the red lens cover (useful for maintaining night vision), one of the reasons I bought this light is easily broken and does not stay on as well as I would like, I have lost/broken both of mine."
1,Not Worth The Cost,"A junky product that is hard to maneuver and gives a poor light, stick with a product like Streamlight or any upscale lighting product."
4,Seems nice,"Bought this bow set for my son for Christmas. It seems very sturdy and easy enough to pull for a 9 year old boy. We haven't gotten to use it yet, thanks to the extra long winter. But I am sure we will have hours of fun with it when the clouds break and things warm up a bit."
2,Watch out for kids,You have to be careful. Don't shoot the bow and arrow when little kids are around. Don't let little kids around!! But otherwise it is a very good bow but don't shoot it at any kid or not even near.
5,glenn tilbrook one for the road,a very different type of music dvd-more initimate and thoroughly enjoyable
4,Glenn!,Of course I loved it! But then again how can you not enjoy clips of Glenn's concerts? Having seen Glenn Tilbrook live last year in Ann Arbor it brought back a lot of very happy emotions for me. Expected a little more music in the movie but enjoyed what was there. Would've liked to have heard more of his solo work instead of just Squeeze tunes. Also liked the interview with Chris Difford.
5,Cheers then!,"I was one of the fortunate folks to catch Glenn on this tour. The man is a legend, truly a crowd pleaser and bona-fide singer/songwriter.This docu takes you through a slightly obsessive (in a good way) history of 80's pop band Squeeze and frontman Glenn Tilbrook's journey of doing an acoustic tour of the states, in an RV. Simply charming, kudos to Amy for a job well done on the docu."
1,Ridiculous,From merely the cover of the book one can see what a charlatan Ashida Kim is. I am a martial artist and I can tell you that this book is a piece of junk. Ashida Kim is not a real martial artist. He cannot even spell the art he professes to study correctly. Its ninjutsu not ninjitusu. The moves he advises in this book are foolhardy at best and go downhill from there. Stay away from this book and all others by Ashida Kim.
1,I find this funny,"Ok, I will get straight to the point and say that you should NOT buy this book. Ashida Kim is not Asian, and his name comes from 2 different countires (Ashida=Japan, Kim=Korea). Now, Stephan Hayes is also not Asian, but has practiced NinjUtsu. Ashida Kim does not even say in his books how he got to be a ninja. He writes this farfetched stories that couldn't even get published in a fictional book.And this, this is the funniest. If you want a good book describing how a woman should fight, maybe a woman should WRITE the book?! I've seen females destroy this book, because of the lies he put in this book that will get a woman killed.Save your money. You want NinjUtsu, not NinjItsu, go to Hatsumi or Hayes. Not Kim."
5,Definitive text on self defense for women,"This book serves as a practical, easy to understand text on self protection for women. Valuable information is shared which allows even women with little martial art experience to defend themselves effectively. Escapes from stand up attacks and ground attacks are explained and illustrated clearly, as well as preventive measures for out-witting potential attackers. The origins of the female ninja explained in this text adds further to the richness of this work, adding an element of history that will intrigue the reader. Well done, Ashida Kim!"
3,The American Way,"This book does have good pictures. ....I bought this book hoping for much more. I am a huge fan of the womens game in America, and I know many of the players, but this book does not do them justice. The player biographies are about half a page for most, and they are not all profiled in-depth. The superstars are, but the lesser known players barely have a paragraph. ....It is only about 15 pageas of reading, the rest of the 48 pages are pictures."
4,Very good collection,"I loved this CD so much. My dad bought it for me when I was like 12. then I lost it and I almost cried. I bought it again because i coudlnt live without it. a great song for relaxing at night. WEll known songs and some not so well known stuff, but its all first rate"
3,Decent quality basket but size not as stated,"Had to send back ... basket is angled, much smaller width at the bottom than stated in specs. May not matter for some things but did for me."
3,This CD has to be re-discovered,"This album is one first that have been composed by Michel Berger for France Gall in 1977. The songs are beautiful, sometimes very naive, but so sincere and deep... France Gall manage to transmit so many emotions... If you like this CD, you can also buy ""France Gall - 1974"" and ""Il jouait du piano debout - 1981"". Maybe they are the best albums she has ever made, believe me!"
5,great find at Amazon,"La nostalgie, camarade... I was 13 when I bought the vinyl. Sadly it got lost. Beautiful songs."
5,A reality check,"Malcolm is victimzed for his kindness while his best friend is rewarded for being a bad boy. Jeanty did a wonderful job exploring the relationships between friends, mother and son and male/female. It's a great read!"
5,nice heart warming story,"This book is the urban version of ""When Harry Met Sally"". Dexter and Malcolm's friendship is a complement of most men in America. Wonderful book!"
5,Romance at its best!,This book is very refreshing. Every woman should read this book so they can get insight on the male psyche.
2,Disappointing,"From the look of the book cover, one would think that this book entailed a wild and adventoruos plot; but much to my surprise this book was just full of romance. Very disappointing if you're not a fan of romance."
4,A Different Kind of Love Story,"Interesting read! I was trying to remember the last time I read a book from a ""loser's"" point of view and realized it's been a while. Once you start reading, you have to finish it because you'll want to find out how or if the underdog will win. You'll find yourself all wrapped up in this one. I found myself thinking about the many guys in my past who were like Malcom and could get nowhere with me because they weren't (whatever) enough.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was the cover. It was a turnoff for me because I don't usually read sexually explicit literature. However, Mr. Jeanty recommended this book at his booksigning. I didn't get it that day but opted for another one of his books with a less explicit cover. After reading Hoodfellas, I was curious as to why he was pushing this one so I went back to pick it up. Nice move Mr. Jeanty because I am now anxious to read all of your books!"
5,Unique boxes for any occasion,"This is a wonderful book on learning to make your own beautiful & unique boxes. By varying the paper & decorative elements a stunning variety of boxes can be made based on few basic designs.The step-by-step instructions are very easy to follow. Both photographs & illustrations guide you smoothly through the box making process. Tips on construction & presentation for each box are also included.There are eight box types demonstrated. Included are triangle, cube, frame, magician, puzzle, heart, lotus, & a matchbox. For each one there is a one-page gallery of different design ideas.In the back there are templates for each box. It even includes paper elements you can tear out and use. I put a picture in a frame box with a pin inside & gave it to my mother for her birthday; she was delighted."
5,Amazing,After watching the IMAX movie I HAD to have the soundtrack. It's wonderfully peaceful and I listen to it almost every night when I'm going to sleep or whenever I just need to mellow. I do not recommend skipping track 10. Maybe it doesn't quite flow with the rest of the cd but it's a beautiful song all the same (it won 'Native Heart Song of the Year' at the 2000 Native American Music Awards).
5,soothing sounds,Great cd! Listen to it relaxing in a couch/bed as the subtle nuances of the music will be easier to hear.Playing in a noisy vehicle will cause you to miss too much.
5,Quilting the Black Eyed Pea,"...I must say this is the best work by nikki since black judgement black thought...I loved this book and just like the title sugguests they are poems and not quite poems...my favorite is ""rosa parks""....it was wonderful, simply nikki...vb"
5,Grand Poet,"Writer Carolyn Heilbrun recommended Nikki Giovanni to me and others at the Chicago Humanities Festival in 2002. I read Giovanni's poetry yesterday and was carried away. My favorite poem in Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea is the one about Richard Williams, tennis father extraordinaire. Read this poem to your father; you and he will smile together."
2,Would it be good for a scooter radio under the seat?,Would it be good for a scooter radio that sits under the seat? Cause it sounds like the knobs would adjust themselves from the shaking so the value of this item is questionable.
1,cheap and old,Symphonic WF104 DVD playerthis was manufactured September 2004Maybe this was an early releasebut I have noticed it will not play any burned discsI have tried DVD-R and CD-R (not high-speed) and mp3 cd-r and dvd-rsays cannot recognize discalso if you can email me[..] the link or file to the remote control manual I will be forever grateful!
2,"Great Value, if it Works","I purchased the Apex AD703 in June 2001 and only used it sparingly until January 2002. Up to that time, I only watched Blockbuster DVD's and put the blame there for the problems I had. I then started to buy DVD's and the problems continued, After my retailer acknowledged the problems with this model, I was given the 5131 in exchange. It worked great for about a week and then died. After reading reviews of these products on other forums, I decided to buy the Daewoo 5700 and have had no problems.The Apex 5131 is a nice machine for a great price - if you can get one that works..."
2,Question:When is a multidisk player NOT a multidisk player ?,"Answer: When it comes from Apex. Based on generally good experiences I've have had with Apex gear, I bought the unit a year ago, and it has functioned properly, playing disks with multiple formats, but it DOES NOT SWITCH from one disk to another by itself, let alone from one track to another on another disk. This a fundamental requirement of a multidisk system, IMHO. I've been waiting for a firmware upgrade, but none has been forecoming. In short, don't buy this unit."
4,What do you expect for [this price]?? Better than you think!,"The Apex 5131 is GREAT for value and function! What I did not find in a lot of advertisements is what it can actually do... probably because it has too much too offer. Find me another box that can do everything thing this can, including being able to read: MP3, CDR/CDRW, DVD/DVDR, MPG (automatically read w/o changing to VCD format, VCD/SVCD, JPG (auto scrolling), Kodak image format, in addition to 3 disc carousel, AND mic inputs for KARAOKE for [this price]or less!! It's not perfect, like the dinky remote but what do you expect for $100. To its credit, this [price]box works better than ANY or higher that I've been reseaching so far! Here's another point, MP3's are FREE on the internet and if this box can read DVDR's, imagine having over 700 MP3 songs on ONE DVDR disk! That's where your savings really begins!... and that's just a start..."
2,Poor customer support,"While the product itself is okay, a functioning remote control is very critical to using all functionality. Unfortunately, my remote didn't function well, and attempting to get customer support was very difficult. It's also difficult to find a universal remote that will operate the player."
1,high pitch noise,"when the disc is spinning in the dvd player, it makes a high pitch noise sound to the speakers.I would not recommand this dvd player."
5,Price/Performance - more features and functionality,"I was stunned on how well this DVD Changer works. I bought mine at Circuit City and was prepared to return it if anything went wrong. The reason I purchased this APEX product to begin with was because of some research I did on-line about the best DVD changers. I own a Sony DVD player which has all kinds of problems playing CD-Rs and just forget about DVD-Rs.This APEX AD5131 supports every type of CD-R I've tried: SVCD, VCD, MP3, DVD+R, Kodak Photo CD, etc. The Karaoke feature is kinda cool too.My only complaint is that you have to point the remote control on the exact same level as the front of the DVD player. Besides that I'm very pleased.The price is awesome - almost $100 cheaper than a Sony 3-disc changer that has less features and less Media type support.Overall, I'm very happy about this purchase."
4,"Great Player, Great Price","I've had two...first one was a dud. Gobbled up the first DVD I was watching about 15 minutes into the movie. Wouldn't rotate to let it go (I believe it may have been fried by a power fluctuation in my house, though).Second one, (on a new ISOBar surge protector), flawless. The presentation for MP3 CDs is great - presents in folder/file fashion like Windows Explorer. Can change two while third is playing, remote needs a little work, but other than that, you can't beat it for the price!"
2,Features but no quality,"APEX players DO sport some of the best FEATURES available; but some of the most inconsistant and questionable quality.The 5131 worked fine with 5"" discs for 8 months. The problem with the unit is that unless you hard power it off, the spindle motor runs ALL THE TIME. The part they used doesn't hold up to that. This is a common problem in the forums, and there is no easy way to repair or replace it.The tray has slots for the 3"" CDs; however, the tray jumps when it spins. Sometimes 5"" CDs will jam or fall back inside, but always with the 3"" CDs. I had a collector CD that was destroyed by the carousel (Scratched through the silver of the CD).As is common with most APEX players, this is of questionable quality. Some people have good luck. We didn't with this one or with a 1110W. Both failed in less than a year with only light to medium use, plenty of ventilation and no physical abuse."
1,An unhappy APEX customer,"I bought the 5131 last summer. It worked well at first, but then my DVD's would start skipping, even brand-new ones. Now the carousel tray will not always open. Sometimes I have to cycle power on it a few times before it starts functioning properly. The whole unit also often freezes completely so I have to restart the DVD and find out where I left off. It's been a while since I have been able to watch a whole DVD whithout the thing crashing."
2,Whyyyy???,"Why is it so expensive?!?! If it was less than $200 I would buy it! Please lower the price, thank you."
3,Ya get what you pay for... I guess?,I was looking for a U.S. Cavalry flag and saw this one for 49 cents plus shipping. I thought WOW...GREAT! My order got here in 3 or 4 days.... AWSOME! I opened my package expecting to see this great deal and was not disappointed until I unfurelled the flag only to see a silhouette of a DOG(!!!!!) not a horse. WELL NO WONDER IT WAS 49 CENTS!!!!! I had to take a sharpie to the Dog sihouette to make it a horse. Let's see if the modification passes muster. Kinda disappointed but then... ya get what ya pay for...!
1,Junk,"Our first unit went through batteries like candy- 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. We returned it and the replacement averaged about 3 weeks to a set of batteries. There are a lot of missed cars before the low battery alarm shows. Now, after 4 months (90 day warranty, of course) the detector is sending constant false alarms. This product is a waste of money."
4,Like this and like that,"After 'Face the Music' and the idea behind it (the launch of his own label and the desire to make non commercial music, but just music GD likes himself) I was very eager to hear what he had come up with this time. Especially after experiencing him liv ein concert twice within a year here in Amsterdam.Face the Music had blown me away, it carried some amazing tunes that I still play frequently and still freak out on it !It was a bit of bummer to find this new release is far more smooth. In fact the first time I played it I was really dissapointed and thought I was never gonna listen to it again....Fortunately I played it in my car a few more times, and now that I have heard it some more, it begins to creep upon me.My end conclusion therefore is: it's great and I love it !!Especially the R.Kelly rip off-alike Saturday Nite (it's just like Steppin but then with some more chords and a bridge :-)Really cool dudes ! lolKeep on doin' yo thang GD !I'm with you."
4,Classic George Duke,"Some of his slow songs sound the same. I have several of his cd's and this one kinda sounds like the others. I, nonetheless, enjoy listening to it"
4,Smooth Jazz with a Kick,"George Duke's second album for his own BPM (Big Piano Music) label isn't as memorable as FACE THE MUSIC, but it still has plenty of highspots. His take on Stevie Wonder's ""Superwoman"" cleverly mixes smooth hip-hop rhythms, a Chuck-D sample, enticing vocals and Duke's flashy but tasty tickling of the ivories. Duke's horn arrangement talents are intact on ""T-Jam"" featuring jazz great Hubert Laws, while the 18-minute ""Hybrids"" successfully emulates Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew"" period. Excellent mellow cuts ""Saturday Night"" and ""Sausalito"" sound like lost album cuts from Mr. Duke's late 70's album. However, Mr. Duke should give the lame ""Somebody's Body"" to one of the those R. Kelly soundalike vocalists."
2,"George, George, George ...","DISCLAIMER: I hate smooth jazz with a passion so if that's a musical style you like please discard this review.To me George Duke is one of the best keyboardist on this planet and after his excellent album ""Face the Music"" I was expecting something of that caliber with ""Duke"". To my disappointment this album is pre-formatted for your local smooth jazz station and to me that is such a waiste of Mr Duke's talent. I was expecting more tracks like ""Somebody's Body"" or ""Hybrids"" where Duke's creativity really shows, killer synth lines, a mix of RnB and fusion, great vocals ... in a sense the music of the George Duke we all know. Nice vibe in ""Sausolito"" too.IF YOU LIKE SMOOTH JAZZ THIS IS FOR YOU ... OTHER THAN THAT STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE SAVE A FEW TRACKS."
2,Save your money,I am a big George Duke fan. However this CD was weak. I played it once and nothing really stood out. Cookie cutter sound. Brothaman let down this time.
4,FANTASTIC,"I'm very happy with this computer, it really has all that I want in this moment, It's fast, small, lightly, anf very confortable"
3,Not their best but sure worth having!,"This is how it all started for Yesterday and Today, later known just as Y&T. If you're a Y&T fan you should get a copy as fast as possible since there is indication that it will be impossible to get a hold on this cd in the future... This debut album contains some classic song like ""25 hours a day"", ""Earthshaker"", ""Fast ladies"" and ""Beatiful dreamer""."
1,Long winded,The author is simply showing off his knowlege of the subject without considering his audience. He doesn't explain the material in detail for new users. Keep looking...
4,good value..return bar a problem,"this is a good turntable for the price. the cartridge has reasonable sound a lot of people would be happy with. i put an audio technica at311ep in to have an bi-radial stylus (to track deeper down in the groove). NOTE; i have an old test lp with a blank section to test anti-skating. with the stock cartridge the arm stays in one place. the audio technica skates towards the label! i reduced the tracking weight by removing the set screw that and fixed it. i thought all p-mounts were the same weight.........oh yeah, when i cue up an lp my big fat hand trips the stop/return bar. a little dab of hot glue fixed that (easily removable). you still have the cueing switch to lift the arm somewhere in the middle and manually move the arm without worry.i'd recommend this for someone who wants to listen their old vinyl. BUY A WET BRUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A DIRTY RECORD IS GOING TO SOUND DIRTY."
2,Good at first but not for the long run,"I bought this in 2003 to replace a Technics turntable purchased in 1979, expecting similar service. The 1979 machine played ALL my music until 1988, when I bought my first CD player. Even then, most of my music was on vinyl until the late 90's, and I still used the 1979 turntable for albums I had only in vinyl. This turntable seemed the perfect replacment until the last two months. It slowed, and then stopped working after only 6 years of casual use. The motor has gone belly up, since the post holds the belt and spins will not turn, even with the belt off. Fixya does not have a solution for this problem, and a new cheap (disposable) turntable for a seems an equivalent replacement for this disappointing product."
5,good,"I got this for my husband. He likes it. It works great. We haven't had any problems. We did need to order a pro amp to go with it so it would hook up to our system, but you can get that from the same place. Fast delivery also."
4,"Very, very good music, emotional, French, cute.","Her musique sounds a little like a French Stevie Nicks, without the attitude. The live album is very nice, perhaps a defining album of the French youth in the late 70's."
1,"I love Newtons work, but dont be fooled by Amazon","This in not what Amazon makes it out to be.. its is simply a notebook (or sketchbook - because its not lined) with a beautiful Helmut Newton photograph on the cover.I was fooled into buying this because that was not made clear any where.I don't regret buying it.. but Amazon should be ashamed for selling the ""notebook"" under false pretenses"
4,Nice basic every day glass,Update:I purchased three sets of these 2 years ago and not one has broken. Unlike other reviewers I had no problem with how the glasses were delivered. All arrived intact. I have ordered many glass products from Amazon and only once had anything break. Amazon was great about getting a replacement out.I love the size and the weight of these glasses. The glass itself still looks good after many cycles in the dishwasher. None of these glasses even have a nick on the rim.
3,Bells Best.,"Steve Bell is a Canadian songwriter/singer. I would label this a folk/blues type album. This CD has awesome lyrics and the instruments are very awesome. Great songs in ""wings of an Eagle"" (probably my favorite song of his) ""Burning Ember"" and ""Drumheller Circle"" (a great instrumental). He has some very worshipful songs that have very powerful lyrics that are sung to God."
3,"Comprehensive, but boring","I read Fetzer's ""Artificial Intelligence: Its Scope and Limits"" during an attempt to review as much literature on the philosophical foundations of AI as possible for my research. While Fetzer's book was quite comprehensive, I found it rather boring, and therefore hard to read! My advice to any prospective reader is to read only those sections which interest you and no more. The book tries to cover as much as possible about the scope and limits of classical AI and is refreshing in its consideration of semiotics (chapter 2 is devoted to symbol systems and semiotic systems) and the relevance of Pierce's theories to the design of intelligent machines. However, I found many discussions in Fetzer's book to be rather banal, and many of his arguments are poor. An example of this is the first chapter's discussion of Searle's Chinese Room and Rapaport's Korean Room."
3,Smell too strong,"My mom did not like the smell. Its too strong for her. My mom sneeze many times. I'm ok with the smell, strong but good, like perfume spilled. I think it is overpriced."
4,Analytical View,"This is the author's second book on the phenomenon of political correctness. He says he felt compelled to pursue the issue as he had become concerned that education had turned into a form of indoctrination. As a result, his writings are designed to expose some of the fallacies he's encountered. We're told ""This movement (i.e., political correctness) has had its crosshairs trained on the very heart of American culture and the traditions (the Judeo-Christian tradition, the work ethic, the traditional family, etc.) upon which that culture was founded"" (p. 6).His documentation is strong. His logic is solid. He makes a good case for his point of view. This is a book worth reading."
4,this is PWEI,"PWEI is my favorite band of all time. This is their first U.S. release. They have a great unique sound, which still holds it's own even today. If you enjoy stuff like Beastie Boys and Meat Beat Manifesto then you should definitely enjoy this. They combine all kinds of samples and loops with awesome beats and riffing guitars. This is an explosion of revolutionary music. I do not consider this their best album, but it is their first and it is awesome. If you've been alive for the past 20 years and never heard of the poppies then this is the place to start. This is the day...This is the hour...This is this."
3,Theory Light,"I applaud the authors' attempt to provide an accessible, easy to understand synthesis of student development theory, but they have sacrificed depth for breadth and left the reader with a text that, like over-processed food, provides some nutrition but ultimately fails to satisfy. The book is below the level of most master's degree students and practitioners in student affairs, though it might provide a useful introduction to theory for undergraduates or a useful reference book for administrators who don't have time to read original sources."
4,Student Development,This was a required book for my graduate class. It provides an excellent overview on a variety of student development theories. I will be hanging onto this text to use a resource.
3,"Readable format, but a yawner for me","This book was one of my textbooks in a class on college student development. The other one was the supposed ""classic"" by Chickering. If you have to choose between the two books, go for this one. It's much more clearly written and has much better research supporting the authors' claims. Moreover, each chapter is organized concisely with a vignette at the beginning, a section on theory, and then another on measurement and research based on the theory.I personally didn't like that book, but that's just because my interests are elsewhere. (It's more of a problem with me than with the book.) That doesn't change the fact, though, that this book is theoretically and scientifically strong while staying easily digestible for the average graduate student."
5,Very Pleased,Book arrived in record time...just in time for my class so I was very pleased. It was also in great shape and very well packaged. Thanks.
5,Great Summer of 1982,"This is a very good coming of age story. The narrative unfolds with the adventures of the boys. Though the plot is not so tight, this reflects the carefree life teen boys enjoy. Summer heat brings lust to the minds of young boys but more than sex, this book brings in the forefront the struggles of teenage boys tethering to manhood - relationships with parents, pressures from peers and social acceptance in the midst of multicultural differences."
5,Exciting,"I just finished reading this... this book covers everything in a city.. the secrets the dissapearances and friendships. I don't know how anyone could have a better bunch of friends than this, its not something I will ever forget. I have the names of the characters on the tip of my tongue - Aaron, Ben, Steve, Harry, Joe! Its as though they are alive and somewhere out there waiting for me to join them... You gotta love these guys. This is one book that just has so many good things in it its hard to put down!"
1,disappointing,"I purchased his hoping to keep rabbits and maybe squirrels from coming through my backyard fence to eat my lawn. This product is light bordering on flimsy and posed no challenge to the critters gnawing through it. It may be fine for other purposes, for what I wanted, it was worthless. I took it down and put up a thin gauge wire fence instead. Fingers crossed, it seems to be doing the job."
1,Rip Off,Huge rip off. Go to Walmart and buy this for under ten dollars. This will not keep dogs out.
2,Would be good if the rabbits didn't eat it.,This fence was much easier to work with than regular chicken wire. Unfortunately the rabbits found it much easier to chew through as well. It lasted about a week before I had to put regular chicken wire over top of it as the rabbits had chewed at least 5 holes in it.
5,How to Have Fun!!,"I loved this book. It invites a new player without forgetting the originals, which are the foundation to the group. My fav line is when ""Rig"" describes ""Rock"" as his lover and ""Pretty"" as their lover. The author knows how to write about emotions of three, how they manage to stay connected in the presence of two, keeping it real. That's the hard part with 3. How do ""2"" manage to love each other without someone being left out. The book is very erotic and the first installment of the three lovers, and maybe the best."
5,honest memories and knowledge,"i liked the part where she came back to NYC and lost her way and fell into the illness everyone, almost, had said she'd had and she was now 'mad' , but still she knew she wasn't and so did we"
1,Worthless Piece of Junk,"I've had this antenna actually an older version of this antenna and I've been fighting it for years. I agree with all the One Star reviews. Maybe ring toss is a great idea! The T-Wire included with most amps is better. I have an RCA indoor HD antenna that I hadn't realized does FM. I spit the signal and WOW so much better than this, or the wire.RCA ANT1450 Multi-Directional Digital Flat Amplified Home Theater Antenna (White)This one. Now I'm working on AM."
1,Good for ring tossing,"The only thing the Terk boosted was my credit card balance. It's really great if you plan to use it for a good game of ring toss or as a hat holder but as an electronic device, it's a joke"
2,No improvement on AM,"I bought this and returned it within 24 hours. I hooked this up to two different radios (Grundig, Boston) and tested it on AM stations that were weak in my area. There was absolutely no difference in reception with or without this attached. My future solution will be buying a house where I can put up a large outdoor loop antenna."
1,What a Waste!!,Don't buy this. I bought it to specifically pull in an AM station and I got better reception from the cheap little loop antenna that came with the stereo. Adjusting the gain dial did nothing. It's going back to the store tomorrow.
4,Better for FM than AM,"This is a good, reasonably priced antenna for pulling in weak or distant FM stations. I have one at home and one at work, both attached to Proton RS-330 radios. The Terk AM Advantage is better for AM stations, but the tower is OK if that's the only antenna you buy.Roz"
1,save your cash,I had this for over a year and it is useless...you'd be better off just using speaker wire.
3,This book is more for an owner who has had birds before.,"This book is good, It dosen't talk to much on one topic, however it does talk about almost everything such as feeding, behaviour, history, taming (training) and more. However if you want a more usefull book that tells you what to do and how this isn't the book for you."
5,Finally! Beethoven can rest in peace now.,This is the one that I have been looking and waiting for all these years. Maestro Herreweghe's understanding of this music is so fresh and crisp it finally quenched my thirst. This recording brings 'joy' back into the Beethoven Symphony No 9. Listen to it and you will know what I am talking about.
1,The most soporific prestissimo ever,"I've just downloaded and listened to this version of Beethoven's Ninth. All you need to know is that the prestissimo, which is the exclamation point of the greatest symphony ever written, is a disaster. It almost sounds as if the orchestra is about to fall asleep. How Herreweghe thought this tempo was appropriate is puzzling. And the timpanist plays like he is struggling with the last drum roll. And I've enjoyed Herreweghe's recent Beethoven symphonies on Pentatone. They are really first class. But for the Ninth, you'd be better off getting the recent Dausgaard with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra on Simax or the Skrowaczewski with the SRSO on Oehms. But stay away from this unless you want to sleep through the ending."
1,Disappointing recording,"Although HMC is a highly respected record company, I really have some trouble with their recordings. I tried to listen to it three or four time after I bought the CD and I cannot continue after 5 minutes no matter which movement I was listening. The sound seems to be highly restricted and unreal. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
4,A world you can step into,"I think I come to this book from a slightly different perspective, since I am not a reader of romance. However, having bought this book for its description of the Highlands, I was not disappointed. I recognized many of the characters in this book from my own visits, and the author's command of descriptive language made this a real pleasure. In fact, I feel that this book would have been complete without the love angle entirely. Not that I have anything against love, but what interested me more were Clare's own triumphs and travails. Even so, a worthwhile book."
4,Good reading!,"I have read approximately 20 romance novels with a Scottish Highlands setting, hoping to come across one that compares with Dianna Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series. This is the closest I have found. Although the story is totally different, the writing quality compares. Not everyone reads romance novels for the explicit sex, and I thank this author for concentrating more on telling a good story!"
2,Not my favorite facial product,"This is not my favorite Biotherm facial moisturizer. I live in a humid climate with very hot summers and find that this product - although it is a ""gel"" which to me suggests something cooling and refreshing - feels actually pretty sticky on my face when applying it.Once the gel is absorbed, the drier areas feel as if I put absolutely nothing on. More than once did I have to put on a second moisturizer over the Aquasource because my skin felt taut and uncomfortable. This is probably much more of a product for people in their 20s who still have issues with breakouts. But for my skin type with rather dry cheeks, this is simply not the right moisturizer."
5,Great little book - quick read info,This is a great little book with some quick reference to good information most people need to know. Great little stocking stuffer this year for our two adult sons. Dave Ramsey is our hero!
5,The Money Answer Book,This is a good book for those who want to get their finances in order. Great seller also. Thanks so much Vickie
5,The Money Answer Book,"This is a quick, to-the-point read. Really helps pinpoint questions and answers. A good guide to seek out additional information."
5,Dave,All of his books have been helpful in sorting out a better way to manage money. We took his course through church and it was well worth it.
2,Simplistic answers to money questions,"Like he said: ""Personal finance is 80 percent behavior and only 20 percent head knowledge!""This money answer book really only give me 20% answers to many money questions.I still try to find out his mutual funds that give him 12% returns (especially last 5 years.)"
4,SImple to undestand and well thought out,"Ramsey's book is aimed mainly at the novice and people who are just starting to explore the world of personal finance. For that, this is an awesome first step as he lays down a foundation for a better financial future.It isn't just that the book has sound money advice, I was pleased to see this as a common sense approach to questions we like to complicate.Although this book would serve as a valuable reference to ANYONE interested in their own financial future, it would especially be useful to a young person just ""starting out"" or to any person who feels overwhelmed by their own financial situation."
4,Shorter version of his other book,"I read this book because I liked the other book, The Total Money Makeover, by Dave Ramsey. This book is organized in a question and short answer format. What I like about it is that you can just flip to the questions you are interested in. The author is very strict about some of his rules such as never using credit cards at all. He says that there is no responsible usage of credit cards, not even for airline miles. While I can see why he thinks this way, I use credit cards, but I always pay off my balance.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
3,the Money Answer Book,"If you have not read any of his books, this is a great place to start. Without going into a great amount of detail, he highlights nearly everything that he stands for. It really can whet the appetite for some of his other books, especially The Total Money Makeover. The Money Answer Book is a perfect place to begin your journey down the road to financial peace."
1,Do Not Buy,"This book doesn't give you a strategy for building wealth. It is just a series of answered questions that don't add up. All the advice that Ramsey gives is information you can find on the internet. 1. Credit Cards are bad. 2. Spend less than you make 3. Invest. Mr. Ramsey also says that you can find 12% returns on your mutual funds, really, please tell me where and average investor can get that....that would be advice I would pay for!It is a very short book that will take less than an hour to read, however it is not worth the $13.00 price tag."
4,A very interesting book - answer to money questions,"Interesting book, covering many typical money related questions we all face on a daily basis. In his peculiar style, Ramsey answers our questions trying to guide us for a sometimes painful way to achieve our goals, but remember.. no pain, no gain.This book have a simple message: stay out of debt. If you are in debt, pay them all asap! Be free!- Book size: good.- Cover: oh no! another book with Dave's pic on it? Come on guys! let's be serious about that.. is that an ego problem?- Questions: most of them are good, trying to cover all ages and situations- Categories: could improve creating more categories, eg: related to children.- Several of the solutions (using financial instruments) apply only in the USA.- This review applies to the 2010 edition ISBN 978 1404 187795"
3,dangerous,"I thought this would of had more ww2 or at least all war but when you have an episode on stunt men which i don't think that would go under the title of dangerous missions.The ww2 episodes that are on this are good value and footage that i haven't seen before, so if you love knowing what brave men did to keep freedom for us to take for granted i would say this is worth the dollars that they are asking.They even have an episode on u-boats so they also look at it from both sides as they were only doing the same as us and fighting for their lives and mates.great value for money"
4,Very Interesting! Mostly WWII - & Oddly Connected Dangerous Jobs,"I read the other review and agree that it is odd that this set is mostly WWII and some other odd dangerous jobs. I dissagree that it promises to be all about WWII. I think they went by the photo only - and did Not read the episode index.I'm not a WWII buff - but found most of it to be very interesting.I also liked the epsiodes about Daredevils and the history of Ice Trucking.I found the one about Timber (dangerous logging) to be sad (as I love trees).Rescue swimmers is informative - but not my topic.Hostage Negotiators - I like - but was a bit general.Overall - a very good set. I find WWII amazing the sacrafic (a lot of that in here) and the tenacity to win.For me - I'd rather a set about very odd - different jobs - this is mostly WWII, but still mostly well done. Scott MacNeil."
1,"Old, cheesy projects","If you want a book of old, cheesy and ugly projects, this book is for you. Horrible photos, disappointing projects, it's all there."
5,Just in time !,We have no similar books in Physical Oceanography. It puts together the description of many useful techniques (including the modern ones) and it also considers pratical aspects of data collection and analysis. The text is easy to follow. The figures are very clear. Useful references are cited. Other geophysical areas can also benefit from it. Do I need to say something else !
1,Never received the item,I would never order again. To date I have never received the order. On a scale from 1- 5. I would give a zero rating.
3,Good but lacking,"Sun, Sin and Suburbia is an interesting, well-written and impeccably researched volume. As a non-Las Vegan I would have liked to read more about the Mob; the Culinary Union's struggles; Howard Hughes and Steve Wynn, and less about residential communities. Whilst the book added to my knowledge of Sin City, it fell short of its promise to be ""An Essential History of Modern Las Vegas""."
5,"Edge of the bed, with the lights on reading.",This is a first for deVere-Austin and very good. Hoping this lady keeps up the good work. Good luck Wendy.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book sight unseen based on the glowing reviews on Amazon. Once I received the book, was very disappointed and returned it. I've been doing goddess-oriented work for over 30 years and have read and published reviews of many books in this genre. While the writer is sincere, most of the time the book seems to be addressed to a five-year old. Lots of gushy, pep-talk writing. For the very very beginner, if anyone."
4,Instant comfort food,"These beans are the backpackers best comfort foods on the trail. Light, easy to prepare and delicious. A must for all light weight backpackers kits."
4,Good Book for Review,"This book is a summer review book before going into the [...]. I have twin girls that just finished kindergarten. Everything that is in this book was covered in their kindergarten class. Last year, I purchased the kindergarten Curriculum Book and that was also much review but it also had some challenging concepts that they had not learned previously in preschool. I would not use this Grade 1 book as a companion for their [...] learning but I think it is a wonderful source for continued summer learning and review before children enter the [...]."
5,1st grade curriculum,"I wrote one for 3rd grade that I loved it, Same goes for 1st grade! Its very helpful and fun for my child! I'll be getting the 2nd grade pretty soon!!!!!"
3,"Not As Pictured, But Functional...","I received an extremely old copy of this book (not even the same cover and the paper is whiter). With that said, my 6 year old step son loves this book! It's more appropriate for a Kindergartener than a 1st Grader, but it's still usable. Only a 3 star for not being as pictured, but overall happy with my purchase!"
3,A Little Better than the Bunch,"Most books on this topic are long on rhetoric, and short on detail. To an extent this book is just like the rest. Lots of glossy photos, and lots of gaps in the text. That said, this book is better than most - due purely to its length. The problem with most 'how to"" books, is that the authors assume that the readers can mind-read - it's what makes VCR programming guides unintelligible. I have done some car restoration, but I wouldn't want to rely on this book [anymore than any others I've read] as a starting point for a restoration, if I were a complete amateur.Some topics are adequately dealt with; but sadly, other important topics are glossed over."
2,Ok but not for begginers,Perhaps this book is out dated but one thing for sure is that it's for advanced restorers. I have been around cars for years(30+) but have never under gone a complete restoration and if I did I would not choose this book.
4,Girl's Sounds ...Almost,"You have to click on each song. Some are re-makes, which normally ends my consideration. But there are many many excellent original recordings. So overall, not a bad buy."
5,Great coach and teacher of baseball.,Good background on the life of Coach Garrido and the way he set his life goals early in life and worked hard to get to achieving his dream.
2,what was she thinking,This was really quite bad. I don't want to be hard on it because I like light movies. I just like to be entertained. I couldn't be because the male lead was so weak it hurt. I think the lead actress was better than this project. Don't bother.
5,One of the movies that will make you AWWWWWWW,"At first, I thought that the story is odrinary and predictable. Although, at some case it is, they were able to make it sweet and touching. I was very suprised in the ending, it was so unexpected ans ofcourse very sweet. It's definitely a good watch!"
5,"Light, romantic entertainment!","This is a great little screwball comedy about a farce of a romance perpetrated to bring in a desperately needed haul of household furnishings and cash to pay off a debt to the mob! Hey, if two desperate people need ""stuff,"" why not announce your engagement, register at department stores, and sit back waiting for the haul to arrive?What could possibly go wrong?For Milissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence, the sham romance turns out to be real, much to their surprise. This movie is tremendous fun, and not to be missed!"
5,Fun romance!,"Vince is the typical ""hasn't found his place yet in the world"" risk taker with trouble, aka The Monkey, lurking at every bend. She is the high maintenance bachelorette who's a conniving strategist. Together, watch out world! My Fake Fiance is a great romance for a relaxing dinner date at home. It is not a simple chic flick, my husband even got into it for the comedy aspects.Ps her wedding gown is simple yet gorgeous; the green adds a sleek elegance."
5,Great Movie,I love this movie! It arrived on time and in great condition. It is like I bought it brand new!
2,good player but radio has stopped working after a few years,had it for a few years now and It does everything it is meant to except the radio has went out and now I will have to replace it.
2,Bardot is adorable; the film's a dud.,"Bridget Bardot stars in this slight, ineffective would-be slapstick comedy, co-directed by Roger Vadim. The plot is slapdash, and while Bardot is a total babe, we don't really get much of a chance to take in her charms... she has a kooky, carefree dance scene, and wears some weird outfits during a dream sequence, but really none of it is worth sitting through the actual film."
2,A Dull Movie But a Great Bardot Feature,"If you're not a Bardot fan, there's no particular reason to watch this movie: the dialog doesn't exactly sparkle, the slap-stick is quite corny, the plot-line makes little sense, and the characters are likely flatter than the monitor you're using to view this. However, a young Brigitte Bardot stars in this film and manages to be effervescent, kooky and lovable all at once-- the original manic pixie dream girl, one could say! If you're a fan of hers, be sure to rent this movie. And the Amazon digital copy, by the way, actually is quite crisp and clear, with decent subtitles. It's much better than the grainy, ugly trailer makes it look!"
5,Sounds like his best album to date.,"I got into Bill Frisell after listening to this album. After listening to excerpts from his previous albums; I think this is his best work. It's not folk or jazz, but an interesting blend of both."
4,"A very interesting book, but a bit pricey!!",A very well researched and written book. This is the work of a very promising young scholar.
1,not a good hair dryer,This had one speed and temp - HOT and FAST. You had no time to style and it felt like it was really damaging your hair. Was not pleased at all.
3,Not worth the money,"The blow dryer did shorten my drying time and left my hair very silky but also very very flat - no body/bounce. Also had lots of fly aways. For the price, it's not worth it. Had better dryers much more affordable/better results."
5,Everything they promise it's true,"This dryer is the best one I had in my life, is everything it promises the only thing is that is a little bit heavy for me, but with the result it worth it"
2,Nice Blowdryer - But It's Not Worth The Money,"New Bio Ionic Idry Whisper Light Conditioning Hair Dryer 1400wI paid $110 for this blow dryer in Feb 2007. It lasted just over 3 years and died in Jun 2010. I've had cheaper blowdryers outlast this one.It's a good blowdryer, but not worth $110+. Buy yourself a cheaper ionic hairdryer and then you won't feel bad if it doesn't last."
2,"Tedious, 100 pages of story in 360 pages.",This trilogy would probably make one good novel. Both the first and second books are very slow and don't get very far. They both seem like they are from a novel that was stretched into a trilogy.
2,the texas chainsaw massacre,having watched this at the theatre my expectations were reduced from excited to disapointment i wanted the hammers busting skulls and saws chopping thrue bodies and some big sausage party at the end with some idiot screaming get her grandpa i guess after thinking more about it it was a ok movie 2 stars only because i got to see Leatherface my hero
4,"Scary in all the right places, with great 6.1 sound","I purchased this DVD used based on the 6.1 sound. The movie is what it is - Scary, Gory and Gruesome. The special effects are pretty intense and well done. The 6.1 sound is excellent. The rear surround speakers are effectively utilized and not just a repetition of the 5.1 surround speakers. The subwoofer rocks the house. So, if you are a fan of this genre film and are looking for a great DTS 6.1 sound, pick this movie up. Enjoy, j."
3,Disappointed...,"I am pretty big fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. I'm not going to go into what was wrong with this one or what it lacked. I just want to say, if you haven't seen this or are a fan it will probably be a let down. If you are a newcomer to the series it will probably be alright. If you want to see something real good take a look at the original. In my opinion this does not hold a candle to the original or even the second. As for the next generation one, this is better than that but what isn't... Rent It!"
2,Pretty Boring for a Slasher Flick,"I love horror movies. I love bad horror movies. This movie isn't bad it's lame. I watched it with a group of horror afficionados and we were quite bored throughout most of the film. It seemed to drag on and on. There was probably 25 minutes of interesting footage in the whole flick.If you are looking for a body count & lots of gore I'd say check out House of 1,000 corpses. The story is just as weak as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but at least it isn't boring.If you want a witty, freaky, and somewhat gory movie I suggest May instead of this movie.I'm glad I didn't see it in the theatre."
5,The Best Movie of The Year,"I got 2 words to describe this movie CRA-ZY, this is one of the best horror movies of the year. I loved every bit of this movie from begining all the way to the ending. They need to remake the rest of the old TCM movies. This is a must own DVD."
5,Better than the original,There is only one thing to say about the different versions of this movie....this remake blows the others away. The original is a laugh compared to this thrilling and terrifying new version. Definetely worth the money. Too bad I have to wait until March 30th.
3,Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 vs. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003:,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974:* This one is SOO MUCH SCARIER AND SUSPENSFUL!!!* The evil gang desing is SOO CREEPY!!* The settings are also scarier.* There are more screams here.* The story here is better.* The violence is more realistic.* The ending is SO MUCH BETTER!Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003:* Better budget.* Better acting.* More blood and gore.* More graphic violence.To my conclution, no need to say that the 1974 version is beter! But if you only want to see blood and gore then I recomend this one.adios."
3,Why did this movie get remade?,"The 2003 version was a good Movie but, a BAD REMAKE. It has nothing to do with the original 1974 version. The only thing that was in both films was the green van. Other then that the Two movie's are completly different. I didn't care for it"
1,Horror gone too far,"I decided to experiment with different genres of movies and I decided to venture into this movie. I understand that horror is about scaring you out of your wits, but seeing gore and arms flying everywhere is not the kind of scared I want to be. I want to be scared by the mind games that the director weaves into the story. It does not take much talent on the director's part to throw in as much gore as they can to get the rating of R. This story would have been much more effective if people could have left the movie and said, ""That was really scary, although I didn't think it had to be rated R."" I understand that this is the DVD, but I believe that the majority of the horror films coming from this day and age are usually filled more with gore than with chilling ideas that freak one's mind out. Overall, I think this remake was an uninspired move that used gore rather than ideas to scare. Not very good."
3,meh...nothing special,"well...as i hated the original movie (couldnt stand the 30 minutes screaming near the end), this remake was better that most remakes. It had alright casting, great effects, but boring story. This is one of those movies that lasts forever andnever ends, it has a boring beginning but get good just as u want to turn it off. Leatherface looked superb, but i didnt like the little noises he made, it seemed forced. But all in all it has very good gore and at (some) times is frightful. I would think twice about actually reccomending it to sombody, but u have to see for yourself.o yea... WHERES THE EXTRAS! there is none, they make u pay an extra $10 for some crappy extras, what a rip-off"
3,The Texas Time Travelers?,"How can this film's group of teenagers drive through Texas in 1973 & listen to a Lynrd Synrd song (""Sweet Home Alabama"") that wasn't released until 1974? Do they travel through some sort of time warp?"
3,A hard one to rate,"I really was not sure weather i should give the remake 3 stars or 4 stars. Becuase i really did not know, i stuck with 3. Now, i did like this movie, however, there were certain elements in the movie i did not like.One: they changed several names of characters(including Sawyer to Hewitt)Two: there is no franklin(where is sally or ""erin's"" bro franklin?)Three: a bunch of other crap i dont feel like typing.Now, don't blow this movie off. its still a fairly good and super scary horror film. thats all i got to say.-foward-2222222333444091whtevrr!!1!@"
1,Unessesary remake of a worthless horror film.,This is even worse than the original. Do not see it. Enough said.
1,Texas Chainsaw Blood-fest,"Okay, the whole point of the original T.C.M. was to create a terrifying movie with a low budget and no blood. Tobe did it. He did a fantastic job. The original T.C.M. is excellent. This new one is so terrible, that it falls just short of a teen-slasher flick. The only reason why it doesn't is because it involves characters that were once original (where's the hitchhiker?) and the story was original once. People who made T.C.M. 2003, you suck. People who liked it, you don't deserve it."
1,"""You're all going to die...if u watch this movie...","Lame.Predictable.And overall DISGRACEFULL!!! What has happened to Hollywood filmmakers? It's like their not even trying anymore! Wes Craven, Kevin Bacon(He directed the first Friday the 13th movie, remember.) Hell, Even Stephen King! But the screenwriter and director of this movie hav been kissing all of those misfit one night stand horror characters ass. And this film definetly proves it. In all ways's to describe this movie Lame(remember when Leatherface slashed that guy in the bathroom and the ring fell down the bathtub drain?)Predictable(Little girl puts gun into mouth and blows her brains out? Funny, but stupid.)Disgracefull(The director took Leatherfaces chainsaw and chainsawed a huge slice into the name of horror!)If you like horror movies, then DO NOT buy this movie. If you like Lame,Predictable, and disgracefull movies, then watch this movie and you have just kissed Leatherfaces ass! See U In The Future..."
4,Good effort after the original,"The 2003 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a well-done remake. Obviously it could have done better in some respects, such as the movie being a little bit longer but it was pretty damn good. I hope there will be a sequel. For all of you unfortunate people who think this is based on something that actually happened in Texas it did not. This movie is based on the crimes of Ed Gein, who killed and dismembered a few bodies in Wisconsin in the '50s. Gein inspired quite a few movies, such as Psycho, Halloween, Silence of the Lambs, the original TCM. So the footage at the beginning, not real. Just thought everybody would like to know that. This movie will chill you to the bone the first time you see it but after that it gets less and less scary. Anyway great movie and hope to see a sequel sometime."
4,TEXAS CHAINSAW,I WOULD GIVE IT 4 IN A HALF BUT I DONT THINK THAT IS AVAILABLE. GREAT MOVIE AND DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF MAKING A REMAKE OF THE CREEPY ORIGINAL. THIS 1 IS EVEN SOMEWHAT CREEPEIR THAN THE ORIGINAL. A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. AND A DEFINATE MUST HAVE FOR ANY HORROR FAN. LOVED IT. ITS ABOUT 5 PEOPLE GO TO FIND HELP IN TEXAS AFTER THEY SEE SOMEONE COMITT SUICIDE[SPOILER]. BUT WHAT THEY FIND IS A FAMILY OF VISOUS AND DANGEROUS CANNIBALS WHO WANT THEM DEAD!
1,More gore does NOT make a better film.,"I'm a big fan of the original, but this remake just did not have the scary atmosphere of the Tobe Hooper classic we all know and love. In fact, I was bored. Hollywood has no original ideas left. Buy a DVD of the original, and leave this bad remake to the kiddies who dont know any better..."
1,Gee All Poor Leatherface Needed Was Some Skin Cream and a Shrink,"There is a terrifying trend in modern horror films, villians with psychiatric issues. I for one find this to be a cheap pitiful cop out, and just silly. This movie although filmed dark and moody isn't really scary and Leatherface comes off as that weird kid in school who had a lot of acne who just finally snapped. Why filmmakers find the need to remake everything these days is beyond me, but this one was really unnecessary, the updating doesn't really help this time around. Maybe Leatherface was just crazy, why can't these villians just be sick in the head without the new personal self image troubles, c'mon people save that crap for the next Hilary Duff movie. Tobe Hooper this movie is an insult to what you created and I apologize for having even seen it."
1,Remake suck my ass,this movie SUCKED. I cant believe they can even slap the title on this piece of crap. The original was so amazing and even the sequels were better than this. I am going to go hurl at the defacation of this priceless gore treasure. Kiss my ass Jessica Beal!!!!!!!!!
1,Groooooooooooosse,"This remake of a 1970s cult cassic is not as scary as it is compleatly disgusting. The grosse-out fest begins in the first 20 minutes when the hitchhiker pulls a pistol out of her, uh, female genitalia. Right when the chainsaw starts up a youngster gets his leg hacked off. The phsycho with a skin disorder drags him to the basment and throws a hand-full of salt on the wound. There are very few truly scary part, and most of them are the glimpes of the killer's deformed face. I could'ent feel for the charecters that this town of hicks are bent on killing. Although, Jessica Biel is really hot. If you have a weak stomach, leave this one be. If you are a horror movie buff, rent the 1970s version and hold off until this one comes on cable."
1,"The sickest, most depressing horror film I've ever seen.","This film makes Friday The 13th look like a friendly Semeame Street sitcom by comparison. The way some of those young people were tortured before they died, the disturbing plot, the main person's (always seems to be the woman) judgement calls got her fiends killed made this the most awful, disturbing, sick, depressing, unsettling horror movie for me to ever lay eyes on.Yes, this was too much EVEN FOR ME!, and I enjoy those Freddy and Jason movies without being afraid. Just kill the victims and get it over with, don't torture them and keep'em alive, that's the worst thing you can do."
5,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Reveiw By: Jessie B.,"There was no stopping Tobe Hopper when it came down to making yet the 8th installmment of the 1979 ""Texas Chaninsaw Massacre,"" but the qeustion was--who whould be the one to direct it? After repetivly searching for almost a year, in the late summer (unbelivebly on AUGUST 18, 2002) Tobe had found his man-Marcus Nispel. The story is so different from the original but it gave the veiwers time to strech out ""character development.""""I wanted to bring out the good and bad quitlites that Morgan, Andy, Kemper, Pepper, and Erin had, than from the original 1979 one where they just jumped right into killing them--then of coarse they had the unrealistic features which made the orginal seem a bit jajun."" Marcus told me once before he casted Eric Balfour as the part of Kemper. I give the movie 5 stars because it scared me just seeing myself on screen like that--even though i wasn't scared of Leatherface @ all while we were filming!"
1,HACK & SLASH TRASH,"A vanload of 70s teens en route to a rock concert stumble upon a depraved backwoods house haunted by a chainsaw-wielding leper with a bad attitude and all hell breaks loose. Remake of Tobe Hooper's original cult classic and vastly inferior even to that somewhat dubious underground hit. The atmosphere is admittedly thick with doom and there are shocks and gore aplenty for those who like such things, but characterization, plot, and logic are all sorely lacking. Jessica Biel is a standout scream queen and R. Lee Ermey chews the scenery with gusto, but there aren't many other good things to say about this nightmarish movie. Basically just another teenage splatterfest, if neither the best nor the worst in that overdone genre. A great example of the barbaric nature which dominates modern horror. Not recommended."
4,Remake Better Than Original,"I'm sorry to say it, but this remake is better than the old 1974 version. This immediately gets to the action and doesn't drag on as bad as the old one does. Leatherface seems to use his chainsaw more and also it makes you feel like he is really doing this people, unlike in the original where he starts to skin the guy, but you can't see what he's doing. Jessica Biel makes a better leading lady, she runs faster than Marilyn Burns (1974 version), who was so slow that Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface) had to start cutting tree branches to keep himself from overtaking her. Either way, I like the new version better than the old. I'm sorry to say it. I truly am."
1,Terrible. Nowhere near as good as the original.,"Bad movie. I advise you to stay away, unless you enjoy watching Jessica Biel get tortured."
1,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (New Line Platinum Series),"If I could have given this movie a zero, I would have. It was just stupid. I mean, I'm at a loss of words....for me that's rare, as to just how poorly made this seemingly low budget movie is. DON'T waste your time or money."
1,the REmake of what movie?,"OK THIS IS THE STUPIDEST REMAKE I HAVE EVER SEEN.WHERE IS THE COOK,FRANK,CRAZY BROTHER/HITCH HIKER,OR EVER THE PLOT.. THE LEFT SO MUCH OUT OF THE REFAKE,IT IS LIKE WATCHING A FAILED SEQUEL.THE MOVIE DOESNT EVEN SHOW AND ""MEAT"" EATING WITCH IS THE POINT OF THE KIDS GETTING KILLED.AND THE GRAVE ROBBINGS WHERE ARE THEY AT? THE ENDING TO THIS ONE SUCKED ALSO!IF YOU WATCH PART 2 AFTER YOU WATCH THE REMAKE IT MAKES NO CENS,BUT IF YOU WATCH PART 2 WITH THE REAL TCM,THEN IT MAKES CENS...IN THIS ONE THEY ADDED SOME NEW/DUMB IDEAS TOO LIKE,HAVING THE TEENS TO BE POT HEADS,A HITCH HIKER SUICIDE,A LITTLE KID (A.K.A. A LITTLE BROTHER) A ""CRAZY COP"",KIDNAPPING WOMEN,AND THE MADE LETHERFACE REALLY SMART IN THIS ONE,NO TALK ABOUT CANNIBALISM AT ALL AND THIS REFAKE SUCKS!"
1,Yuck!,"What a waste of money this was! No suspense, no terror, no plot. Just your usual gaggle of brainless teenagers getting slaughtered one by one (As if we don't have enough of those already). Jeez, aren't there any *original* ideas in Hollywood anymore? Do we really need another movie with some dimbulb chick in a tank top and no bra is running away from a psycho? Endlessly grim, blood-drenched and unpleasant, this flick is as fun as driving rusty nails up your arms. It's a shame to see R. Lee Ermey and David Dorfman waste their talents in this mindless gorefest. Do yourselves a favor and skip this waste of celluloid."
5,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003),This movie is about five friends who drive through Texas on their way to a concert. They stop in a small Texas town to report a suicide. They spend the first part of the movie looking for the Sheriff. Little do they know that they are all about to die.The casting was perfect. Jessica Biel made an outstanding performance as the main character. Her fear was real. The hick townies were also believable.This movie was excellent. I saw this verion before I rented the original 1974 version. I was very disappointed in the orginial. I will definitely buy the 2003 verion. It is a movie I can watch over and over again.
1,An Insult To The Original,"This is an artless, unpleasant, and unnecessary remake of a horror classic. In most ways this film is the polar opposite of the first film from the 70s. Polished to a blinding shine, and full of pretty faces harvested from the WB, this mess is completely void of the atmosphere and imaginative charm that made the original so important. Cinematic dookie. Avoid like the Norwalk virus."
2,I Was Right,"This is exactly how I predicted it would be- an uninspired hollywood-ization of a true classic.Now, Hollywood is not all bad. Some of the recent remakes have been made well, with heart, like DAWN OF THE DEAD. TCM, however, is a typical modern blockbuster horror film meant to screen three or four weeks, bring in an easy 50 million, and that's that.It irks me that they had to do it to a classic. I gave it an honest chance, and it had its moments, but when all was said and done, it flopped. Using the TCM title means that you are to undergo more scrutiny then if you were to release something like this under a different name.Typical teen slasher flick."
3,Much better than the 1970's version,"When i watched the 1970's version of texas chainsaw massacre, I was very dissapointed because I heard it was insanely bloody, scary, and gorey. I disagreed 100 percent. If they were referring to the new one, I would have agreed 100 percent. Not too much humor for a horror movie. My idea of the perfect horror movie is Resident Evil 2. Enought humor, gore, everything, but thats not the point. Point is, this was a great movie. Much better than the 70's version, more gore, blood, and scarier. What makes it even cooler is that this movie was based on similar events."
2,Where is the special features,"Ok, good movie, very good movie, but no special features, with a movie like this, you need behind the scens stuff, [but] all they give ya is the trailer and commentary."
3,its okay,"If you like part 2,3,4 you will probably like this.The movie looks great,has awsome sound and has some cool moments.It has alot of gore,the original didnt and was a hell of a lot more creepy and scary,oh well.The movie drags for the first 50 mins with a billion chances for the idiots to leave. This movie gets annoying when they scream for help,then when they get it,they sit there and say nothing about the madman with a human skin mask and chainsaw! Bonus points for getting john laroquette for voice over."
3,nice,This was a great movie. If yuo loved the first one see this. Oh yeah I saw a reveiw that said this movie was way to grusom and discusting. Its texas chainsaw massacre what do you exspect.
2,Overrated,"I really don`t think that this film is going to be a classic one.I think it`s not scary enough,and personally in comparison with other movies like gothika or the exorcist i would`nt choose it.OK some scenes may be cool but,from this movie,i expected much more.don`t spend your money on it ,unless you don`t find something better"
4,A One Way Trip To Hell,"Being a HUGE fan of the original, I approached this with some hesitation & a certain amount of cynicism. Not disappointed in the least, I was overjoyed to see that this one was almost as good. As far as horror remakes go, it's an absolute winner. While not possessing quite the same feeling of shut-in violence the original had, there is still plenty to enjoy. The story has been beefed up some(there is a baby involved, there are female members of ""The Family"")and it is undoubtedly more violent(unnecessarily), but in many ways retains the same feeling of being trapped in one of the most frightening places on earth. Full marks should go to Jessica Biel(utterly beautiful)for being a wonderfully convincing ""last girl"" & Leatherface does a sterling job. Gloriously designed set pieces & some seriously good cinematography make this one a winner. I hope they don't compromise the good work on this one by making a bunch of cheesy sequels. Some things are better left just as they are....."
4,Not really remade just reborn.,"Needless to say, I'm a huge TCM fan, even when things started going downhill. Like everyone else, i was massivly sceptical of a remake. Like most people, I was pleasently surprised to find this movie as gruesome and grungy as the original, with some added perks.As far as the disc goes, its a must have. They're gonna spread out a steady supply of extras over two discs and theyre promising killer sound and picture quality. And its all kept in a sweet tin collector case."
1,its the worst horror movie ever,this might be the goriest movie in history. now i saw this movie at a friends house because we rented it. we had the t.v. volume all the way up and it wasnt scary at all.i think this movie is only good for people who like and play the game manhunt.if i could put negative stars i would.
1,Remakes don't work!,"Where to start? As long as Hollywood is remaking classic films. Why don't they re do Ben Hur and the Wizard of OZ? What makes movies classic and memorable is originality. Tobe Hooper's original film was no big budget film, but it stood out from everything else in that period. The remake veers from the original story and cinematic gore is used to replace it. For those who belived that it was based on a true story as mentioned in the beginning of the film ""that's the whole point!"" it plays into the psychological aspect. They want you believing that someone's tall tale can be that effective. It worked......view the original before you see this and then compare the two."
1,A HORRIBLE MESS,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. Go out and rent the ORIGINAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This remake is horrible! I can't get the image of the goofball guy who looks like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo outta my mind -- driving that minivan with Sweet Home Alabama playing on the radio. AAAAAAA! Scary stuff!One of the reasons given for the R-rating is ""drug content."" Uh-huh. Don't blink, or you'll miss the guy taking a quick toke.The original was a real horror film. This remake is simply a gross-out film. Nothing new. Nothing scary. Even ""Leatherface"" is a yawn. He looks like a bloated Elvis Presley wearing a Richard Nixon mask."
1,Hollywood destroys yet another classic!,"STOP ALREADY! What a terrible remake of one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It's been done before! Why do it again? You can't make movies like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" any better by throwing millions of dollars into the production.Loud bangs and CG effects don't make a horror classic and it certainly doesn't increase the effectiveness of a classic.Supposedly this movie takes place in 1973, yet Jessica Biel prances around in today's fashion with her low rider jeans, way to play the part(note sarcasm). Leatherface, played by a no named actor brought NO effort to his part and was a bore. Gunnar Hansen was actually asked to play the part but turned it down simply because he hated the fact Hollywood was creating a remake.This movie delivers nothing new and is an insult to horror classics and fans of the genre. Steer clear at all costs!"
1,MICHAEL BAY IS THE WORST PRODUCER/DIRECTOR EVER!!!,THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE LIKE ANYTHING ELSES MICHAEL BAY GETS HIS HANDS ON!!!!!The original is a masterpieceThe remake is a school kid coloring out of the lines
4,Here me out,"Ok before a die hard fan of the origianl movie clicks on the no box below here me out.Why don't you people who say that the remake was better see the new one as a diffrent series?You have to admit that this is a pretty good film.I know you're thinking that this is just some teenager who never saw the original,well guess again.I did see the original and I thought that it was good too.I think that the people who say that this one is worse than the original go into the movie with their minds set that they're going to hate it.Give it a chance.The directing and acting in the movie is really good,not acadamy award winning but some of the best i've seen in horror movies.At least they didn't make a total mockery of the series like Freddy vs. Jason.So come on people stop treating the original as the best piece of horror movies open your minds to new things."
2,Boring for a Slasher Flick,"I love horror movies. I love bad horror movies. This movie isn't bad it's lame. I watched it with a group of horror afficionados and we were quite bored throughout most of the film. It seemed to drag on and on. There was probably 25 minutes of interesting footage in the whole flick.If you are looking for a body count & lots of gore I'd say check out House of 1,000 corpses. The story is just as weak as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but at least it isn't boring.If you want a witty, freaky, and somewhat gory movie I suggest May instead of this movie.I'm glad I didn't see it in the theatre."
3,The movie is good but the 1 disc DVD sucks!,"Besides the cool cover and the music video, this DVD has nothing on it besides trailers and TV spots. I suggest that if you want real features then fork out the extra 10-15 bucks for some cool stuff. but if you thought the movie was okay and just want to own it because you're a horror fan, then just stick with the 1-disc because you probably don't care about features and just want to see Jessica Biel run around (nude scene anybody?) in a tight shirt and want nothing more than that. See the movie then make your decision!"
3,A good Halloween flick.,"This movie has a great Halloween atmosphere. It was a dark and somewhat beautiful film, especially the scences in and around the farm house. The acting somewhat lacks, and yes it is a remake. It is no where near a great film, but I will enjoy watching it around Halloween time."
3,Was this really a remake?...........,I saw the original and I loved it and I went and watched the remake. Was this really the remake?Though it was a good remake was this really a remake or a sequal?1.I dont remeber seeing a girl blow her brains out in a van.2.I dont remeber the main character saving a kid in the original.3.Were was the guy in the weel chair?4.Was this really inspired by a true story?....I dont get why they ruind a classic.They are ruining the movies reputation.And now there gonna do it with dawn of the dead.FOR SHAME!!!!!I enjoyed this movie in some bizaro way but how can werelate this to a remake? Cmon now.......Its a good movie but if it is a remake it doesnt live upto the hype. Well At least for me. But that girl from 7th heaven is hot!Check the movie out for your self if you want.
1,Jessica Biel -- ANNOYING,"My previous review of this horrible film failed to address the Jessica Biel factor -- a factor which so many of you have pointed out.I nominate this Jessica Biel character for most annoying actor of the year, along with Lisa Kudrow in WONDERLAND.The only reason I kept watching this film was to see Leatherface hang Biel from a meat hook. My bad judgement! Jessica Biel is the one responsible for all the problems. Smoke some weed? She can't! Leave a rotting corpse behind? She can't! Put the guy hanging from a meat hook out of his misery? She can't! Act?? SHE CAN'T!!Suffice to say that in the middle of a Texas chainsaw massakree Biel goes on an anti-marijuana crusade."
4,The deaths,"There is one death in this movie that I can't possibly think of right know, Pepper Harrington is one of the victims, when her and Erin(played by Jessica Biel) are in the van at night, Leatherface takes his chainsaw and puts it right through the top of the van and it cuts Pepper in the arm, thank God she's wearing a coat. So she runs out of the van, and Leatherface chases her by running with a 35 pound chainsaw and she picks up a barrel and Leatherface saws it into flames and Pepper runs and Leatherface slices her in the back and then she falls to the ground and Leatherface puts the chainsaw right through her stomach and feathers are all over in the air, because she wore a blue coat that had feathers in the lining of it."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"This is not an horror movie. There is no gore, no blood or violence in this film at all. You don't even see the death scenes only hear screams. Boring and stupid."
3,Not bad for a remake,"I just saw this movie and watched it on mysurround sound and with the lights off.To be honested,I don't get scared whilewatching horror movies.This remake ofthe 1974 original version is not that bad.I like the chain saw movies better in colorof course.However there was only 1 or 2 goodactors in the whole movie.The story line wasalright but could have been better.This is a must own for every die hardLeather face fan."
2,Buy the original,"I will make this simple.BUY THE ORIGINAL I think it was 1974 or was it 1972, im pretty sure 74'. Anyway for the person who said it was creepy, and also said jeepers creepers is scary, please dont listen to him cause he obviousley dont know horror.Im just not a fanm of new horror, on occasion maybe here and there a new one will come out thats good,ON OCCASION. the best horror is late 60's to late 80' even can find some decent in the early 90's. Horror since the early 90's on to 2005 has just really sucked bad.IMO.if you found the movie ""scream ""to be scary or ' I know what u did last summer"", or jeepers creepers or the new TCM or when darkness falls or the joke of a remake of 2005 Dawn of the dead. ThenI just feel for you."
3,not bad but not good 2.5 stars,I bought this dvd and have only watched it twice and the second time was to make sure. I was expecting way more gore than what i saw. The only decent gore scene was the girl shooting herself in the van. The only chain sawing you really see is from a distance shot from behind Leatherface. Movie should have been rated PG-13
4,Back to basics,"Okay. Jessica Biel in a tank top. Very nice. One unrealistic quality was Jessica in a meat locker, and then in a sprinkler system (after the meat locker) and no natural reaction under the tank top.....Great movie, tho. A few startling moments towards to beginning. Great camera work, and some of the effects (not to give anything away) were fantastic. Good old fashioned horror flick stuff. Hot chick running away from the bad guys, dark shadowy corners where evil things creep, and lots of gore! No one likes the thought of meeting the wrong end of a chainsaw! Well worth the 5 bucks I spent buying it used here at Amazon..."
3,Not As Scary As It Looks...,"I was terrified to see this movie! I DID NOT want to see it, but it's involving, and you get sunk into it, that's the upside about it! Now, Jessica Biel and her friends are on a roadtrip, They stop at a strange house, she greets an old man and he says she could use the phone. That's where the slaughters begin! It Is Not Scary! Even I wasn't scared, and I'm scared of everything! You know what the two scariest things are about this movie?! First, It was a true story!!!! And Second, Leatherface's mask, scares the hell out of you, recommended to new horror genre fans, but to those who have seen horror movies and love them, skip this, you've seen it before."
4,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(2003),"This Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake from 2003 is very good. It has good production values and slick special effects. Jessica Biel looks hot in a white undershirt, blue jeans, and boots. R. Lee Ermey's Uncle Charlie ended up becoming more popular than Leatherface. This remake is a period piece that takes place in 1973. Sally's name has been changed to ""Erin"". Some of the camera work is flashy. A camera somehow glides through a bullet hole in a van window! The same producers made a prequel movie starring Jordana Brewster, R. Lee Ermey and Diora Baird. A 3D remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out not too long ago.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a good remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 cult classic."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,This film is epic in every sense of the word. The actors did a great job. Very well directed masterpiece.
5,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,2003","This movie was far more scarier than the original. The special effects are gruesome, gory, bloody, and just plain awesome! This classic story remake gives an appeasing twist to the original. I recommend this film to anyone who's in for a scare!"
2,R. Lee Ermey ruins this remake for EVERYONE ! ! !,"Horrible idea casting R. Lee Ermey in this remake of Tobe Hooper's horror classic. He becomes the center of attention and it's almost like watching ""Full Metal Jacket Part 2."" Any attempts to distill Hooper's claustrophobia are absent. Not worth your time."
3,Texas Chainsaw Remake,"This movie holds its own. The cast was refreshingly good. Leatherface got a touch up and looked even more disfigured. However at the end of the film I felt unsatisfied. Then it dawned on me... it wasn't the original. The original just had a certain feel to it that this new one didn't acquire. Overall a good movie, as long as you haven't seen the original."
2,Leave what lies beneath alone,"I am going to be quite frank here...the original is still setting trends in Hollywood, providing they have vancant lots where blood gets splattered all around the set. This movie surprisingly, in it's original form...used a more Alfred Hitchcock approach...the horror in broad daylight. Ok, to give a nod to this version is to say that it have a dark underbelly...because basically it's that side of humanity that seems to run amok. This version here just runs on pure terror but runs out of steam, is it that we are so jaded to this, we accept it? I hope not.Well worth a view...but Ihink Tobe Hooper created something that made audiences gasp 30 years ago...this time we close our eyes...what was the point???"
3,Awesome,I just saw this movie last night at a friends house. It was cool and everything but it could have been more gorey and scarier. Im definately gonna buy it.
1,TITillating,"I'm only disappointed that this wasn't a musical. Jessica Simpson and Calvin Klein couldn't have done it better themselves. i suppose this is what happens when michael bay and tobe hooper join forces in producing a flick. tobe, sir, time has only made you smarter. i never knew ed gein didnt have a nose! maybe thats why he kept so many around the house. wow! so much new info revealed! this is a truly deep deep film. so faithful to the events which inspired the phenomena. the message about human evil that the first one conveyed was not very clear to me. they did such a good job at making the message of this new one easy to understand. for all you so called tcm fans who didnt really understand the purpose of the original, here ya go. problem solved. heres the action and gore youve been waiting for. who needs all the raw, organic, real stuff in the original when now youve got...well..uh..ya know. well anyways thankyou."
1,Stupid,"It's a story about a group of young people lost somewhere in the Texas and getting killed for no reason. It's just another mater piece of American style movie that makes American stupider.If you love movies such as 28 days, Bad Boyz II, and big fans of PS2 game Manhunt, go rent this DVD right away. This is the movie for you i guarantee. Other than that, stay away!!"
5,Loved it!,"Many people go in expecting this movie to be made exactly like the original. It is hard for any movie to compete with it's original but I think this one gave it a run for it's money. I think the new twists and similar storyline were good and damn scary. I can't remember the last time I left the theater thinking ""... that scared me"" and this did. With all the new teen slasher films out that are just poor and predictable this was definitely worth the watch!!"
4,Remake,I saw both texas chainsaw massacres and I thought the second one was scarier esp with the women who commits suicide in the beginning. I was a bit confused with the second one though. I had to watch it again to finally understand it. I would recommend a person to see both texas chainsaw massacres. I liked the second one better.
4,For All You Remake Haters,"Alright look, obviously most of the people who hate this movie are fans of the original. I agree the original was much better, but come on how can you say that this movie was not well done. I think that the casting, directing, and producing was really great. I like the fact that Michael Bay took out some of the things from the original, because it brings the focus on the best character, LEATHERFACE! In the original leather face was whinny and in the new one he is a straight up savage. He does not waste his time with a dumb little chainsaw dance at the end, come on that is a cheesy idea. The only thing that I really did not like about this movie is that the producer and director tried to stay away from the cannibal idea. I think that that idea adds extra intensity and makes the movie more scary. Trust me folks if you want a gory in your face type of movie then check it out, otherwise go rent that corny flick Freddy Vs. Jason. Peace!"
1,I cant stand it anymore,"THIS IS A REMAKE OF AN OLDER FILM! IT HAS THE SAME TITLE AS THE ORIGINAL FILM! ITS A REMAKE! SO IS ""PLANET OF THE APES""DAWN OF THE DEAD"",'PSYCHO"",""WILLARD"",""THE RING"",AND A LOT OF OTHER REMAKES.IF YOU MAKE A MOVIE INSPIRED BY ANOTHER.. THATS COOL,BUT..IF YOU CASH IN USING THE ORIGINAL FILMS TITLE,GUESS WHAT! ITS A REMAKE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS PROBABLY VERY POPULAR FROM THE PAST.IF YOU DONT WANT IT TO BE COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL CHANGE THE FRIGGING TITLE, ADD PART 5,OR COME UP WITH SOMETHING ORIGINAL.MOVIES LIKE THIS EVEN IF THEY TURN OUT WELL,ARE JUST MILKING SOMETHING THAT PROVED POPULAR IN THE PAST."
2,A dirty little film,"Oh lord these people are nasty...sick, sick to hell...!! This movie was effective in creating a grim atmosphere for the demise of those in it. I haven't really seen much of the original, but what I can say is that this one is sick, maybe good for you or not. I just wished they had tried to make it flow much better.Overall, you'll watch it and be happy when it is over, not good not bad, I guess it has its audience, but I still kind of like it."
2,2 STARS FOR THE LAUGHS,"First off, the only thing scary about this movie is the fact that its ""based"" on actual events.This movie was too funny! It is one of those movies where you think, ""oh my gosh, they really deserve to die!"" There is not a single charcter in this whole movie that makes a single logical decision.The gore was unnecessary and so was most of the dialogue. Very predictable even if you have never seen the first one or heard anything about these events. This is a classic teen horror film..""gee honey.. I don't want to ride with weed in the car but I will definitely ride with a dead girl with her face blown off"""
5,Love it,"Good horror movie fun. Sit back with some popcorn and watch Jessica Beil scream her way through the movie. Ok, she doesn't do that through the movie but she is fun to look at if you're not a fan of some sick fun."
4,Good version,"This movie is good, I am a Jessica Beil fan and she is the main reason I hunted this one down to buy. Jessica does great in it as well as her boyfriend. He is a great actor.Would defiently buy again.Great addtion to my collection!"
4,"Great horror film, but falls short of the original.","This movie was good for what it was. It had some truly scary moments that make you jump, however the was far inferior to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The biggest killer of this film was the fact that they had money when they went out to shoot it, and that really hurt the film. The oringinal TCM was shot on a very limited budget, which obiviously showed itself in the film. However, this made the original ten times scarier, because it made it seem like you weren't just watching a movie, but rather a home video of something that really happened. While I will buy this film, it will never hold the same palce in my heart as the original TCM!!!!!!!!!!1"
3,Leatherface meets Baywatch.,"This movie isn't bad but doesn't hold a candle to the original..It is way more graphic but, the original was more of of a psychological thriller.. The thing about the original TCM was that it was so fresh and unbelieveable..You really didn't have to see the up close penetration of a hook or something goin in a guy to get the point across..There's no mystery here and they even leave the door open for ""The return of the son of Leatherface"" The leading lady does have a nice rack and I guess if yer gonna pay the big $ for the actress you may as well use all her talents..get the original the real dis""fun""ctional family...."
3,Not as good as expected,"If youre a die hard original TCM fan, steer clear. This movie seems to strive away from the original, leatherface isnt even the same person. This movie seems more to be a re-make of Leatherface TCM3 then the original TCM in my view. All of the aspects are in this movie and TCM 3. A family with more than 4 members in it helping to slaughter people, Leatherface not even changing masks to show his emotional state, Ive only watched it once since purchase, and will probably not watch it again. Die hard fans steer clear like I said,and if youre new to horror I wouldnt suggest it to you even."
1,Totally Worthless Product,"This item was completely unusable. I received it damaged with several wire holders missing from it, but even if it had been in perfect condition, it wouldn't have even stood on it's own. Nothing is holding it together. The shelves just lay on the two end pieces. They do not connect in any way. Waste of money."
5,"Wayne Westcott, Ph.D., author Strength Training for Seniors",Rutstein on Fitness is absolutely amazing. It is miraculous that Jeff made such a complete and successful turn around in his life. This book details his fitness and lifestyle philosophy and will lead many individuals to physical and mental fitness.
3,Glorified Magazine Article,"I didn't find this ""book"" all that helpful. It's more like a high-level overview of security and common practices. I didn't really find any nuggest of wisdom or neat tricks or even recommendataions really.It's like a fancy ""about home security"" pamphlet and not really worth the money or shipping."
3,"Otto, or up with dead people","disappointing, to much junk and not enough flesh. this is not a good follow-up to his last film, Raspberry Reich. worth a 3 for all the hard work his actors did."
3,Otto Me Up,"It would have been great, except I paid 18 dollars for two-day shipping and the movie didn't arrive for a week. Halloween movie party didn't happen. Anyway, I enjoyed Otto. It is much slower paced and emotional than anticipated. It made me a little sad, but hopeful. It was funny and had some really great imagery. But, it was a little slow. Film- 3 and one half stars Two-day shipping- no stars"
2,"Interesting theme, boring movie.","It had my two favorite subjects, gays & movies. But lacked in interest. Zombies are supossed to be evolved version of what we are used to, but many incoherences appears during the treatment of this subject. Beggings and ends mostly the same way as the main caracther, doesn't know where it comes from, and doesn't know where it's going."
2,Scraping the beefheart barrel--for completists only,"Quite inferior to the Magic Band's official output. It consists of rough, often incomplete, instrumental takes of songs mostly already available in a more polished, presentable form. There's also quite a bit of silence, goofing around, session chatter, & filler. There are a few redeemable tracks which would have fit on a single disc with room to spare. The critical acclaim the set has gotten is most likely an effort to pay tribute to the retired Don Van Vliet (Beefheart). He deserves this. However, for my money, I recommend careful consideration prior to investing in this particular material."
2,Not to mention...,"...that the design is really, really irritating. Unreadable and user-hostile. Especially annoying was the b/w shot of Don, in action, at mike, where only his pupils had been inked in some silly metallic Pantone from perhaps the most un-Beefheartian pallete imaginable. My eyes hurt trying to get through the stories, and the Drumbo article was not nearly as compelling/revealing as the one in the recent Ptolemaic Terrascope. God, I'm a negative one, aren't I? But frankly, Revenant screwed us all. And I for one do not enjoy being buggered that way. And why are graphic designers so out-and-out AWFUL these days? Is it just computers, or the millenium, or depletion in the freaking ozone layer, or what? Because I came away from the visuals of GROW FINS with no sense of the man himself, the pontoopling enigma of Van Vliet. They shoulda hired Cal Schenkel, or Art Chantry, or someone who actually APPRECIATED Beefheart et son band magique."
2,$90...Are we crazy?,"I have been a fan of ""The Captains"" music for 30 years. No, I am not a super fan, but his music is my ""Music of Choice"". But going against my better judgement...I bought it. And I have listened to it all the way through. The only revelation for me was ""Odd Jobs"". I have never heard it and I like it. But, I am not one that needs to own 13 versions of ""Electricity"". Nor do I need to here him talk about ""whatever"". But it is beautifully packaged, the videos were defintely a plus, and the booklet was good reading. But with the creation of the CD, it seems if Jimi Hendrix snored for 50 minutes, there is a market for it. I, for one, think it is time for some restraint. I just wish I would have learned this prior to spending $90. If you are Beefheart fan, you will buy it anyway. No review will change your mind."
1,Worst...ball...EVER,"The ball was shipped extremely fast, ordered on a Friday and had it by Tuesday morning. That's about where the good feelings stopped. We throw and kick it on pavement when on break at work. It lasted about 7 minutes before it started to warp and become deformed. After 3 15-minute breaks, it finally popped. Worst $11 I ever spent. I should have known to not buy it since it is a McGregor product. We used them in elementary school until they popped and we went to Voit or something else that actually lasted."
5,high quality,I was just looking for a bunch of footballs for a themed party and didn't want to spend a lot of money. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice these are for the price. I would highly recommend buying this even if you only need one
5,Deeply intelligent and sensitive,"A sensitive and beautifully-written account of bringing up a child with high-functioning autism/Asperger's syndrome (who, now a young adult, adds a lengthy and moving account of his own), and of the agonizing problems caused by the lack of a diagnosis, and by bullying and social stigma. It raises the vital question of how you go about helping a child overcome their differences without making them feel that there is something wrong about being different. I have Asperger's syndrome myself, and also went undiagnosed as a child, and this book moved me (and my mother, when I lent it to her) a great deal."
1,Drill Questions have errors and book is too old to be relevant,"I bought this book in 2001 and thought I would review it 9 years later. Strange, I know, but I figured the practice couldn't hurt. As I was doing questions I realized that I was getting answers wrong that just don't seem wrong. Now I can tell that the answer key has errors in it. Further complicating things is that there are like 40 drill questions for each LSAT section, but no explanation for the answers is given.Another reason to avoid this book is the fact that it is too old. The LSAT changes and evolves over time, and a book that is a decade old will not be sufficient."
4,graphic design & rock-n-roll!,"...Had reservations initially paging through this survey of album covers - mainly because I was not familiar with a lot of the music of early rock-n-roll (I'm more of an `electronic music' kind of guy). But after perusing through this extremely detailed and interesting book, I was totally impressed (and sold).The reasons are simple - `100 Best Album Covers' is indeed very representative of all types of musics (including electronic!) from many eras and all types of graphic styles. The authors (experts and very experienced) approached the subject matter from not only a historical perspective (lots of really cool facts!) but from a graphic design perspective. If your interested in music and/or graphic design, this book is for you......."
5,Album Cover as Art,"100 Best Album Covers is a great book that details the stories behind some of the best album covers of all time. Storm Thorgerson & Aubrey Powell formed the duo Hipgnosis and they designed most of Pink Floyd's albums and others as well, so their opinions on what makes a great album cover carry alot of weight. Some of the albums you'll recognize, some you've never seen or even heard of the artist, but they are all visually interesting and the tidbits of information about them are highly interesting."
3,"Solid, Man, Solid","Another solid entry in the NGH series, with much cooler songs than Volume 2 of the 40s. This is a good mixture of standards (Glenn Miller's Chatanooga Choo Choo, Artie Shaw's Frenesi, Dinah Shore's version of Blues in the Night), classic novelty songs (The Hut-Sut Song and Spike Jones' Cocktails for Two), and one classic rarity that wasn't really a ""hit"" (Glenn Miller's Armed Forces band remake of Pistol Packin' Mama with lyrics about an eponymous bomber that need to be heard). Most of this is entertainment not art, but it is good entertainment of its time."
5,a five star CD from nippers collection,"this one i was really satisfied with. Ok i'm only 22, i didnt know many of these songs before i started listening, but honestly there are so many good tracks on here, it doesnt matter if you know them before or not! you will become enamoured! Stormy weather by Lena Horne, Spike Lee's Cocktails for two! Glenn MIller's dreamy selection ""moonlight cocktail"". To die for! Blues in the night by dinah shore - the best version of that song I have heard to date! And no one cannot be impressed with PIano Concerto in B flat! Perfection!"
1,Miss the Latin Touch,"These selections were before my time. But I've been researching Latin music for many years now and I discovered that Xavier Cugat and his Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra made a hit with Perfidia in 1941 just before he quit RCA. Why wasn't it included in this CD? Artie Shaw was a great jazzman and he recorded a jazzy version of Frenesi. Nice of Nipper to include it. Cugat recorded the Latin version of this number. The melody actually originated in Latin America. Didn't it deserve to be included too?. Don't blame Nipper though. Nice dowg, that. I'm sure the 12-year old producers of these selections did not consult him. Othewise he'd have protested with many a WOOF! Shame on you RCA!"
4,Good buy,"How can you lose with this stereo, good looking and great sounding. Plays CD-R and CD-RW CDs along with store bought music."
5,Read This Book in Awe,"This book I,ve read 3 times now in various langauges,Its a true story thats just Mind Blowing (I,ve checket it on the net,,And it is true)...I,m not going to name the content of the book..I,ll just reckomend you READ THIS BOOK and be AWE STRUCK....Mike Wilden"
5,An amazing true story about a miracle healing!,"I couldn't put down the book once I got started and I finished reading it in 2 hours one night! My faith was renewed through that book. When one is in his lowest moments and have noone to turn to, one turns to the Lord and discovers the greatest comfort, love, and refuge from Him, the Creator. Read the book and be saved."
5,perfect,it is nice steel and fit my flask perfect and never once failed me and for a great affordable price
2,Yeah it's stainless... yeah it's small BUT...,There is a lip in the bottom of the funnel leaving some of the fluid stuck up inside the mouth of the funnel. There are signs of welding going on here as the blue and yellow hue of the metal and flashing appear on the inside out of the picture's view. I'll try to post a picture so it can be seen.
3,Funnel for Flask,Did not need to order this. Just as easy to pour straight from the bottle to the flask. I'll keep it and hope I don't lose it.
4,"Too Small, but I was provided a refund","This funnel is apprently for a very small flask. I expected something three or four times larger. However, I was provided a refund when I contacted the seller. If you want a 3/16 inch (bottom)/ 1 1/4 inch (top) metal funnel, this may be what you are seeking."
3,Product Picture Now Correct,"I ordered the shorter funnel as originally listed; however I received a funnel that was much taller and looked like this:SE Stainless Steel Funnel for Flasks.I contacted the seller and they informed me that the picture is incorrect: they only sell the taller funnel.So, the 2 stars is for having an incorrectly listed product. Having said that, the company was friendly and more than happy to refund my order. I elected to just keep the taller funnel because it still suits my needs.Note: As of July 3, 2012, the product appears to show the correct, taller funnel."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!,"I finally got these on the bike and was very disappointed.Our 3 yr. old went down the driveway once and became so frustrated, I decided to take them off and return them.The bar is too large and the wheels are way too wobbly.There is nothing EZ about this set of training wheels!"
2,Not so EZ,Great concept but the wheels have too much flexibility and don't seem to keep the bike steady enough.
5,Because sometimes kids are angry with their parents,"I read this story as a child, and I purchased it when I had my own child. I remember a number of times not understanding my mother and father and not knowing how to verbalize my frustrations. This book made me feel better about those strong feelings. I think too much emphasis is put on not expressing negative emotions, but the reality is that it should be perfectly fine for a kid to be angry with a parent. I think this book's message on how to work through the anger is important because often kids don't understand parental motivation. This is not a terrible message about mothers... This is a message about children learning to understand how to appreciate their parents and all the good things they provide, even if -- from time to time -- they are angry with their parents for decisions they make in order to protect them and teach them right and wrong."
5,Loved this book.,"I recently purchased this book and have been reading it and rereading it. I am a mom who encouraged her bright kids to go to college only to have them return home confused and doubting their faith. Their friends told them I had brainwashed them. It was a huge blow. Was I a brain washer. Is my christian faith a joke. I found this book to be an electric charge to my faith. Maybe I wasn't the one doing the brain washing? God is wonderful. I was doing the right thing. I learned about bias and how it permeates science and life. Mainly this book inspired me to learn more about geology, radiocarbon dating, DNA, archeological finds and our earth's magnetism. I appreciate each of the essays and wish each of the contributors success in their current scientific endeavors."
2,Full of intentional misstatement...,"Start with the first ""essay"" by Jeremy Walter. He perpetuates the myth that the analysis of the sediments deposited by Mt St Helens after its famous eruption ""proves"" that the Grand Canyon could have been formed quickly. First, the ash and other sediments are a far cry from hard rock; it takes much less time to ""erode"" them than it did the Grand Canyon. Second, the volume-vs-time scale is grossly underestimated - using the correct volume for sediment removed, and assuming that the rate of removal is the same for rock (which it wouldn't be), it would still indicate a formation time for the Grand Canyon of at least a million years. Additionally, the Grand Canyon exhibits characteristics that can ONLY be explained by long-term erosive effects and would not occur if it was formed over the less-than-a-year period espoused by the Morrises and their YEC comrades."
1,Sigh,"If the second law of thermodynamics caused a constant breakdown of order everywhere at all times, nothing would grow. The fact that all the creationists were once babies and are now full blown...should indicate a problem with dismissing evolution because of the drift towards entropy. I can imagine some...argument that entropy only prevents evolution, not growth because Jesus wants us to grow(of course, said more ""scientifically""). Besides maybe offering something weak like that, creationists must accept that while on the whole (the universe is a big place) entropy is increasing, this would not prevent evolution.Has anyone else noticed that every creation ""scientist"" is a raving evangelist? If there is ever a book on this subject written by someone whose motivation is science and not god, someone let me know."
1,Are creationists really this ignorant?,"I suppose it is an indictment of our educational system that people can get through school and still have no knowledge of basic science. But this bit of claptrap, with it's endorsements of ""scientists"" who dispute evolution because they think it refutes their narrow brand of religious belief is a crime because people who may not know better will be led to believe that evolution is not a fact."
5,Great,Recieved in great condition. Would use this person or company again. The product was in good conditon and hardly looked read at all.
5,Great summary of Creationism,"This book os a good read to inform both sides of the Creation vs Darwin debate. It is simple and to the point but it doesn't dig deeply enough to confuse the normal reader. All topics are covered including Creation, Evolution, and Present Circumstances in biology and geography.All in all the book is great for learning the basics. It touches on everything without becoming slow and uncumbered by numbers and statistics. Designed to be a tool for helping make an simple arguement it is not the end all for an in depth research project."
1,Where's the science?,"It is not possible to give no stars to this drivel. Unfortunately it seems that the majority of Americans believe in this fairy tale. 50 scientists!, what about the thousands of others who would not waste their time with this religios gargage? Am I to conclude that the VAST majority of Paleontologists,Climatologists,arachaeologists etc are wrong. This is merely peddling religious fairytales aimed at the ignorant and credulous"
1,50 versus over 50 million worldwide hmmmm...bad odds,"Awful, trite, boring, and repetitive - this book insults the intelligence of the reader. A bright torch burning the way toward ignorance. Brings new meaning to the word dishonest.Most people with a college level education should be able to see right through this...unless of course you majored in communications or religious studies."
5,Refreshing!,Thank you to the scientists who contributed their time and thoughts to this book. Well done! It left me wanting more!
1,You have got to be kidding!,"The ""scientists"" in this book seem to have a high correlationwith the Answers in Genesis and Institute for Creation Researchhacks, who have been misrepresenting science for years.They have dragged out the same old tired arguments from personal incredulity and distortions of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics originated by the P.T. Barnum of Creation Science, Henry Morris."
4,Why Evolution does not make sense,"This is a great book for those that need a scientific answer to the question ""Evolution or Creation?"". It is a little hard to read if you only try to understand the technical jargon used to explain their reasoning, how ever if you analyze the different reasons given and compare them to what has been taught in school through the years you may be suprised with the resulting conclusion."
1,Other References,"This books just shows America's craze in the last century is more than just a craze, it's a retalition against science. This presents the views of few estranged scientists, try reading Larson's Summer of the Gods or Gilkey's Creationism on Trial for a more equitable view of the creationism v. evolution debate!"
3,"Solid, but they don't nest.",Pans have straight sides and bottom bowed inwards. The straight sides prevent them from nesting neatly. Product would benefit from a bit of redesign.
3,"Cute, but could've used more","Just bought the book...the role sheets seem a bit ""youngish"" for 8th graders. My thoughts are that these might be better for the younger sets. It says 4th - 8th grades, but my 8th graders would think the sheets were too childish. Perhaps someone could make one for high schoolers, without the cutie cartoons?"
4,easy start to book circles,This has many worksheets for students to use to help make them accountable for their reading. I love that it has the re-printable worksheets as well as examples of how to run literature circles. This is a very useful book.
4,classically written,"This isn't a page-turner. However, it is a great book. It moves slowly - not like most of today's novels. But the slow pace makes the book more provocative."
3,"Full of Information, Repeat of much information","First the positive:This book is full of useful information to help you in organizing your home, your time, your life and more. There are many hints and techniques as well as a encouragement. If you are just starting down the road to organizing, this is a good book to begin with.However, if you already have a fairly well run family and need to fine tune your organizing this is not the book to get.Much of this can be read in any women's magazine in any given month. Many of the ideas are very simplistic (not that this is all bad).Overall, I'd say that there are other better books out there that deal with organizing a home. I prefer Confessions of a Happily Organized Family or others by the same author."
2,boring and old book with a few good tips,boring book with very few good tips-very old !get the new version if your interested. i feel bad for not trying one from the public library before buying.
1,Must've gotten a defective pack...,"I must have gotten a defective pack of these or something, because the first one only actually burned half of my songs to the disc, and all the CD's after say that they aren't blank when I try to burn music to them. Is there something I'm doing wrong cause this has never happened when I've tried to burn music before."
4,Simple but it works,This is really all I needed in my six year old computer. I just wanted to back up some of my smaller shareware programs as all I have it is a CD/DVD Combo. I really don't want to put anymore into this computer so this was all I needed.
4,More space than you think.,"While copying information to CD, I didn't pay attention to MB used. I realised I could put more information that I previously thought. Really helped me store lots of info."
4,I love it!!,"I bought several months ago and wear it once a week at least. It's a little pricy compared to its quality (especially chain looks cheap), but still worth to buy it. The design is so unique!"
2,Star of David Necklaces,"These Artazia pieces are pretty, but if you're looking for Star of David necklaces that embody more of the mystical power and sacred symbolism of the Star of David you might prefer to check out David Weitzman's work (more info in my profile.) I find the Artazia pieces a little to ""out there"" and interpretive, not quite as magical and lovely as they should be."
1,Historical writing at its dismal worst.,"Without a doubt, one of the most boring books I've ever tried reading.This is virtually nothing but an endless litany of names, dates, and places, barely held together by nebulous chapter themes (ex: ""Monarchies in Equipoise"").My wife and I are taking a three week trip throughout Scandinavia, and I sought an interesting historical overview as background. This book is not it. I was a bit concerned since it originally published in 1977, but with 12 printings, I assumed it must have been updated (...wrong...) and was an interesting read (...wrong again...). There's only one illustration in the entire 400 page tome, and it's an out-of-date map.Definitely written by a scholar for other scholars. Perhaps this book would be of interest to someone willing to spend a year deciphiring some runic inscription ... but for anyone seeking an interesting understanding of Scandinavian history, peoples and culture, this is death by detail."
3,The only thing that's good about this cd is that it's rare,"I bought this last summer because it was only 5 or 6 bucks .It's a nice EP simply because I love all the songs on it. Sparks is one of my favorite songs from Parachutes, and Careful Where You Stand and See You Soon are both some of the most beautiful songs in the world. If you can't find this EP, be sure to get both of these songs on the Brothers and Sisters EP and the Blue Room EP.The ""Yellow"" video is just the MTV video and it only plays at about 3x3 inches. Pretty cheap, but I guess it's cool to have the video of Coldplay's first breakthrough single for my children to watch in 25 years."
3,Good but not their best,"Considering that this is a promotional CD and not an official release, we can't hold Coldplay responsible for putting out a bunch of songs that not only don't represent their great music, but could also confuse newcommers. I agree with another reviewer who says the best thing about this is its ""rare"" condition. ""Sparks"" is just a common ballad that does not shine like others. ""Careful where you stand"" is a bit better and one of their earlier works. ""See you soon"" is definitely the jewel of this single, a song that can also be found in the very hard to get Blue Room EP. The acoustic version of ""Yellow"" is good but still doesn't compare to the majestic performances maybe some of you have got a chance to listen to in other singles. The bonus video is also a plus if you are a fan. Overall not bad, but not great either. Definitely an item for collectors and true fans only."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my 10 yr old niece, the chain seemed to be the size more for a 3-5yr old, and the pendant was much larger than I expected."
3,beautiful pendant,My daughter got this necklace for Christmas and really loves the pendant. However she has been unable to wear it because the chain that it came with is way to small. We will have to buy her a new chain for her to wear it- haven't gotten around to that yet :/ .
3,"lovely pendant, necklace too small and fragile","My sister loves her new pendant, but she had to use one of her own necklaces to make it fit right. It is too small and too fragile"
4,above basic,I was hoping it would be a identical to the large flower. It wasn't. The necklace is not as open as it seemed but still pretty.
4,Good for flower girls,"We gave each of our flower girls this necklace (5 & 7 years old). The necklaces are very nice, and they seemed to like them."
4,Review,"Purchased this as a flower girl gift for my 7 year old niece. It's perfect for the occasion, and very age appropriate."
5,necklace,this is so beautiful and I did receive it in time for Christmas.. my niece love it and it was just perfect
4,Made a little girl very happy!,"Met all expectations on Christmas morning. perfect length for 6 yo. Chain is very fine, so it's worn for special occasions."
4,Entertaining,"The movie is very different from the book. However, I'm fascinated by the concept of time travel (which the book stressed this wasn't, but for simplicity's sake...). I liked that no matter what the main characters did which might screw up history as they knew it, everything worked out the way it was supposed to. A certain sense of destiny and fate.It's an action movie. Take it for what it is and enjoy it. Plus, Gerard Butler and Paul Walker aren't hard to look at... :)"
1,Never read the book. But the movie was still pretty bad.,"I only sat through this because my wife wanted to see it. Neither of us have read the book, she saw the trailer for the movie a few years back, liked the trailer, and so she wanted to see the movie.What a mess. It's an interesting story/concept, but one that is so poorly executed. It has a ""made in the 1980's"" feel to it--its production values are far below those typically found in movies from its time (2003). Stereotypical action flick characters, dramatic orchestral music for less-than-dramatic scenes (involving just a few dozen soldiers, rather than hundreds or thousands), cheesy dialogue. It feels like it was slapped together in a hurry.In the end...she still kind of liked it, I guess because of the romantic angle. I couldn't wait for it to end."
1,Donner ripped us off,"Director Richard Donner clearly cut his losses by doing very little in the way of post-production for this film. The sound effects and visual effects are virtually non-existant. During filming, Donner realized he had a turkey when Paul Walker delivered a vacuum-head performance along with the other jokers that dared to call themselves a cast. What an insult. And a ripoff."
1,Horrible Movie,"I am sorry I spent my money to see this movie in the theatre. The acting was stiff, the costumes and historic details were inappropriate for the time period portrayed and I dont even want to discuss ""night arrows"" as a legitimate battle tactic. Dont waste your time with this one."
2,"Low Budget, Racist Time Travel movie","adapted from the MC book by someone who has watched too many episodes of that old 60's potboiler The Time Tunnel.Still, having said that, there are worse films out there."
1,the worst adaptation ever!!,"I wasn't expecting very much, to be honest. But I never thought that Richard Donner, usually a fine action movie director, could make such a piece of trash like this one. It's the worst book to screen adaptation I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot of bad adaptations. It's unbelievable: none of the good things in the book were translated to film; The interesting facts about medieval way of life (costumes, ancient dialects, architecture, etc), the scientific explanation for time travel, the historical facts, whatever. It looks like a episode of Fantastic Journey (the seventies tv show) only less intelligent. It's already a forgotten film. If you didn't see it, don't bother. There's a lot of better things to do with the ticket money, like buying a six pack of beer and throwing the empty cans on the Donner's windows."
2,Use Your Time A Bit More Wisely,"I thought the concept behind this film was interesting so I watched it, only to be sadly dissapointed by the lack of effort behind a good idea.I believe 14th century France would be mortified at how it was portrayed in this film with just a bunch of cardboard boxes thrown together as scenery and badly sewn together costumes. Even the attempt at speaking French seemed somehow out of a French 101 class in high school! The battle scenes are puppetry at best and nothing close to what a good Shakespearean play would have slapped together. The script itself is just far too predictable for my taste.I hoped for more because like I said the idea behind this film is interesting. But next time I think I will spend my money on the book rather than a movie that has sadly run out of time."
4,Interesting and confusing at once,"I gave this film 4 stars because it confused me a little too much for comfort. I had to watch it a second time to understand the bit about how the people back in ""our time"" were trying to fix the wormhole. Aside from that, I hated when they made Francois say that he was a spy and then kill him for it. STUPID 14th CENTURY FRENCH PEOPLE! oh well. can't be helped. Anyway, I liked it because, of course, Gerry's in it. The genre does seem to be getting a little worn-out though, especially seeing as how almost all he does is period pieces. Good effort on everyone's part, but not something I'd recommend to someone looking for a time-travel film that makes decent sense."
2,Where to begin?,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It had everything I like (time travel, medieval Europe, a touch of romance, and Gerry Butler).BUT this movie was so ill-cast and so disjointed that it ended up being a mess on so many levels. I realize that in any time travel movie there will be plot holes that the viewer must be willing to overlook - it's the nature of the beast. But since the screenplay basically butchered the book and the movie run time was less that 2 hours, it was impossible to fill up enough plot holes to make the viewer willing to ""suspend belief"".Now to the casting: who was the creative genius who decided to give top billing to a wet-behind-the-ears boy instead of Gerry Butler? Hello?? Gerry stole the show and was clearly the male lead in this movie. Poor Gerry, so talented and attractive - yet given so little to work with in this ""time bomb""."
1,Buy the book instead,"The book kept me awake far into the night with its attention to historic detail combined with high-tech plausibility. This is something only Michael Crichton could do so well. Highly recommended.The movie .....a cure for insomnia. Billy Connolly in a dramatic role? Sad thing is, he's the best in the film. Horrible acting all around. Cheap sets; cheap thrills. Nuff said. Waste of time.Save your bucks - buy the book for 1/3 the price and settle down for hours of enjoyment."
1,Out of time!,"Boring adaptation of a Michael Crichton's novel in which a group of archaelogists are involved in a time travel adventure and find themselves obliged to fight in a medieval war between France and England. The movie is completely out of pace, although directed by a very known director (Richard Donner, who made 'Superman' and 'Lethal Weapon', full of cardboard situations and misses the point completely. In fact, 'Timeline' could have been a good time travel entry but is just a juvenile movie of sword fight."
2,just plain bad,"i did not read the book, but i am sure that it was decent and fairly plausible. is that a safe assumption? well, it would not be a safe assumption to describe this movie in the same way. it seems like the actors really wanted to come across as serious, but they just didn't. to try to cram in what i'm sure was a good amount of information in the book into a two hour movie was nothing short of disastrous. and if you didn't know that there was a book, this movie is still ridiculously bad. it's the kind of movie you'd see on one of the local tv stations on an early saturday afternoon. it's a notch below B-movies. don't waste your time watching it. not even for paul walker."
2,Read the book instead,"this movie was alright but it could've been a lot better. i didn't particularly like the cast. this movie really shows that paul walker can't really act. there are some intense moments but they become unmemorable and fade away. it isn't even that entertaining. just a movie to watch if you're bored or if there's nothing else good to watch. let me tell you though, the book by michael crichton is VERY, VERY GOOD. i got so much more out of the book than watching this movie. the movie lacks depth and meaning while the book actually brings you back to the midieval times and makes you experience hell. it is terrifying, gripping, and interesting. the movie is...not."
5,A different view on the subject,"This movie itself doesn't talk a whole lot about history as it is common knowledge in the world we live in that knights and castles, and ladies in distress existed a long time ago. What it does though it offers an exciting time with the family and something that you can show your kids (prefferably ages 13-18) and actually talk about it at the same time too. The movie does not rely on the book as much simply because some of the scenes in the book have been used and abused in current movies such as a Knight's Tale. If you wanna have some family fun on Friday night, while learning something new, or if you are a big fan of medieval movies buy this. If you are looking for a perfect screenplay that follows the book script to the letter you will be dissapointed."
2,"Ya, ya the book yadda yadda yadda","Ok so its not as good as the book... what movie is? So that said, the movie is somewhat well shot with good attention to detail as far as the year 1357 is concerned. The acting is something to be desired overall. The conflicts are somewhat sudden and seem overly complicated. This movie is forgettable, in that once you finish watching it you kinda wake up, shake your head and find out whats for dinner. Oh and as far as the character David Stern... um all I could think of was ""damn the man, save the empire."""
2,A poor adventure movie at best,"To put it simply, Timeline is just one of those movies where you're better off watching the trailer than the actual film itself. A sci-fi/historical adventure flick, timeline's plot involves a son along with a bunch of comrades goin through a wormhole to rescue his father from the 14th century. Of course they arrive at the exact date of a major assault by the french on the english garrason in the village of castle gaurd.This may all sound very exciting, but in practice it is not. The movie doesnt feel very exciting at all and in fact I lost interest half way through. The acting is well below par and the plot is just very uninvolved. The special effects too were not at all very stunning, and nothing about the movie rated all that well with me. Its too bad too, because the preview for the movie looked pretty good... oh well they already got my money to rent it."
1,Timeline stinks,"Well, I am the last one to say that a movie is bad because I look at movies for entertainment, not some deep purpose or meaning. I must say that Timeline is BAD! While bits and pieces of the movie are similar to the book, overall, this is one of the worst adaptations that I have ever seen. The main point of the story is the only thing that even comes close to the book. The rest of it, well, isn't even close.As far as entertainment value, I would have to say this movie has little. The only saving grace is the battle scene at the end of the movie. The rest of it was dry and very un-entertaining."
1,If I could only choose negative 5 stars,"This is the worst time travel movie ever made and may be amongst the top 20 worst movies ever made period. I am more entertained by reading, in disbelief, the reviews of those that actually liked it than I ever was at any point during this movie. It is atrocious. Do NOT waste any money only this turkey."
2,"Not horrible, but...","After having read the Michael Crichton book this movie is based on I thought I might enjoy it for an afternoon viewing. Well, I was wrong. The time travel idea has been done and redone and this movie adds nothing of value to the concept. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because Billy Connolly and Gerard Butler are excellent in their roles.P.S. Paul Walker is not an actor. Someone who loves him should tell him to embark on another career path."
1,A jumbled confusion of action with some beautiful panoramas,"This film could have been great. The incredible battle sequences at the castle and the detail on the medieval customs and architecture were wasted on the poorest adaptation of a book I have ever seen. This should have been split into two movies (ala Lord of the Rings) or at the very least run a half hour longer.Too much of the exisitng footage was wasted on implausible escapes and mindless chases, and not enough set-up was engineered to make the audience believe in time travel or what the connection was between the archeological dig and the medieval war. The concept of the little time-transport amulets idiotic and I found myself neither caring which side won (Emglish vs. French) nor understanding why they were fighting.There was nothing in this film to capture my imagination. Just a whirlwind of disjointed action sequences splendidly filmed and passably acted."
2,Watch This One on TV For Free,"Let's face it; some movies were just made to be watched on TV for free, and Timeline is one of them. If I had been sitting at home alone on a rainy day and this came on, I would have watched it and wouldn't have felt too bad. But instead I paid $4 to rent it and wish I had about 3 of my dollars back. This was a plain and simple action flick disguised as something deeper, which it wasn't. The story had potential, but too many important parts were glossed over while character development and plot development were both passed over in favor of fight scenes and more fight scenes. For a supposed ""historical epic,"" this one was about as shallow as they get. You'll feel like you're watching a bunch of college kids running around in costume at the Rennaisance Fair."
2,blah,"This movie is just flat. There's nothing here to really entertain that hasn't been done before. The storyline flows rather awkwardly, and the acting is wretched.Sure, the book wasn't SPECTACULAR, but it was at least entertaining, exciting, and still somewhat original. This movie isn't any of those. It's not so bad that I regret seeing it(hence 2 stars), and I wouldn't shrink away from ever having to see it again, but I certainly wouldn't pay money for it."
2,The book was so much better!,"This movie wasn't a total waste of time, but it didn't do justice to the book either. My husband and I were both riveted by the book, so we rented the movie. It glossed over so much of the fascinating beginning of the book, and simplified so much within the book, that we were left with a bare-bones story. Bare-bones was just not very entertaining. Michael Crichton should be more careful about signing away movie rights!"
1,Timeline with Gerard Butler Received Broken and Glued,I received three movies today and even though Timeline was in a sealed package it is cracked near the center and is tacky as it has been glued. Not real happy with this but I do not think I should pay the expense to send it back. The other two were fine.rip off and the seller was never even kind enough to replace this item or refund my account!
4,Timeline on DVD,Read the book before I saw the movie again.Of course the book has better detail and differs in certain parts from the movie adaptation but it is still an entertaining film to watch.I am a little on a Crichton trip right now (bookwise) and am trying to watch all the movies either again or for the first time.Crichton as a novelist is absolutely awesome and worth reading.
3,"Not as good as the book but not bad, either.","This movie was a bit dissapointing because the special effects of the actual time travel of the group did not live up to what was described in the book but it was probably a bit too technical to put in as written and probably would have detracted from the main thrust of the movie to the viewing public. Still, it wasn't a bad movie and hit all the main points of the book."
4,Timeline,I enjoyed the action and romance in the story and especially liked the character of Merek. If you like action and romance and a lot of sword-play and flaming arrows...enjoy!!!!
3,Pretty entertaining,"This is not a great movie. But it is one of those movies i find myself plugging into the DVD player all the time. Despite it's weak points, it's still a fun movie with some great scenery. Especially Gerard Butler w/o a shirt! ;)"
2,Okay...Book was way better,"I originally saw Timeline on DVD before I read the book. However after reading the book the DVD is not all that great. I recently watched the movie again, and was sorely disapointed. Michael Crichton's book was amazing. There were several details that could have been left out of the movie, however the movie could have been so much better if they chose to follow the book. Timeline is worth renting if you haven't seen it, but I would not go out and buy it. Although the one thing I enjoyed was the Scottish accents, those were awesome to listen to. If you really want a good story read the book instead of watching the movie."
4,Just enjoy the film,"Sure the book is better. Of course the premise is fantastic. And almost every book-based film ""could have been done better."" Just grab some popcorn, sit back, and be entertained. (Hey, it's a better Chrichton-to-film adaptation than Sphere!)I saw this at a friends house and enjoyed it. Would I rave about it? No. But it intrigued me enough to want to read the book. So I did. Now that I've read the book, what do I think? I want to see the film again!Don't try to rationalize scientific facts, just allow yourself to be entertained. I agree with an earlier reviewer that you will either love it or hate it. My family loved it."
3,MODERATELY ENTERTAINING BRAIN CANDY,"As much as I adore Crichton, this adaptation just does not do justice to the nailbiting book. Glossing over the comparison, the movie is still a pretty formulaic action/romance flick, so you'd do well not to expect even a half-decent tackling of the underlying scientific issues. The battle scenes are pretty well done, but after Gladiator, Braveheart or the LOTR series, viewers may be sort of jaded to such histrionics. The music with all its lugubrious piano is passable. Biggest mistake I believe was to have Mr. Walker in the lead role, it takes twice as much pizzazz to carry a movie! Overall, a moderately entertaining weekend-popcorn flick."
4,CD,The item arrived quickly but I do not know if the recepient will enjoy the movie. I chose it for her but she may not care for it at all. Only Christmas come and gone will tell.
1,don't,Richard Donner usually does good movies. Not today. This is another example of a good book that was made into a terrible movie.
1,it sucks,int he movie things happen almost randomly. Subjects are explained in a matter of seconds leaving viewers completely and utterly confused. If you like this type of movie you should read the book timeline. it is so much better. it explains everything. for example it takes about 50 pages to perfectly explain how the time travel works. in the movie things are also inaccurate. some of the guys in the movie were really girls in the book. events happened differently and it sucked. i repeat this movie sucked.
1,A severe disappointment,"I loved reading the book Timeline - I've read it twice and it is one of my favorite books of the last few years. I didn't expect the movie to be nearly as good - movies seldom are - but I didn't expect it to be terrible!From the first few minutes of the movie, I knew something was wrong. The acting seemed poor - the dialog unnatural, and they were cutting things out right and left. Not only did they cut too many scenes - they also fundamentally changed the plot.It's really disappointing when such a good book is ruined in such a poor movie. I actually had trouble watching it.Even though I am clearly biased by reading the book, other less biased people who watched it with me agreed that it was poorly done.What a shame. Don't waste your time with this one - read the book instead!"
1,How bad can a movie get?,"I do not have much to add, all my fellow reviewers that rated this movie 1 star and below have said it all. But i must say that no other movie that has motivated to the extent that i had to log on the internet after i finished viewing it and do the little bit i can to save the rest of the world from wasting there time on even considering this ""movie"" as as something worth there time."
1,awful,"I read the book and looked forward to seeing the movie. I was so disappointed. There was no depth to the characters, the story was week. Also, many things were changed from the book to the movie. They even changed some character's gender. It was just a terrible adaptation. The book was really good though."
3,Read the book!!,"Had I not read the novel first, I would have liked this movie more than Ido. Some very strange choices were made, characters eliminated, but others added for no appareent reason. The casting of Gerard Butler as Andre Marek was perfect. Frances O'Connor, a fine actress, was horrid in her role, I just wanted to punch her.Despite that I actually like this movie."
1,don't waste your time,"This movie is terrible. Half the cast can't act, especially Paul Walker. If you're looking for entertainment, READ THE BOOK!"
1,(Waste of)Time Line,"It's not often that a movie comes out that has good costumes and sets, and a fun idea and then is totally ruined by the worst acting you have ever seen. Not one... Not two... But ALL the actors were horrible. They even forget their accents often. Richard Donner should be ashamed. Don't waste your Timeline on this stinker."
3,A travel back in time and space,"Timeline is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a team ofarchaeologists who end up back in the period of history of the place theyare excavating. Having read the novel, I found the movie dissappointing.I liked the movie but only because of the romance between Gerard Butlerand Lady Claire. He solely seemed to grasp the essence of the role andbecame the part of Andre Marek. The rest of the cast never seemed to get it.Richard Donner has directed some very entertaining movies, perhaps this just isnt his genre."
4,Anything with Gerard Butler can't be all bad,"I read the book and loved it. The movie was pretty faithful to the book, but left out some details. This is not really a star-packed film, but when I saw it, I fell in love with Gerard Butler and his sexy Scottish accent.That alone made it worth buying for me."
4,Don't believe everything you read--this is a decent flick!,"After having read some of the reviews here, I did not expect much. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie! If you like history/action/time travel movies, this one presents a very watchable story. Yes, there are some plot holes here and there, but that's not unusual. I found nothing wrong with the acting and casting of characters. Of course the book was better, as most books are, but some liberties had to be taken when paring it down for a 2 hour movie. There are things you'll pick up when you watch a second time, especially if you did not read the book first.A nice bonus is the special features--four of them about the making of the movie that are fairly comprehensive and decently interesting. All in all a worthy dvd, except for the lack of a booklet/chapter list, which is a pet peeve of mine."
1,Time bomb!,"Richard Donner beats out Ed Wood for the worst director in filmdom with this cheesy effort.The movie combines a complete lack of directorial vision with stilted acting, inane dialogue, some hackneyed, cookie-cutter thrills and an infernal, non-stop music score. The overall result is a trashy presentation of what should have been a robust and entertaining sci-fi movie. Truly third-rate!Don't hold your breath waiting for any of the elements that make the novel by Michael Chriton such an interesting and exciting read. The film bears absolutely no resemblance.Save your money AND your time folks ... buy the book instead!"
3,Fair Movie,"The only thing besides the characters that this movie has in common with the book is that it is slow to start. This is a good movie to see if you like action and have no intention of reading the book. I have learned to accept that no one has been to be able to do a fair adapation of a Michael Chrichton book since Jurassic Park. Watch it for the sake of watching it, but don't expect it to faithfully represent the novel."
2,Stripped-down vehicle.,"The plot holes in TIMELINE are monsterous. To have sucessfully pulled off a filmed version of the highly entertaining CRICHTON novel, the final cut would've been four and a half hours long and budgeted at over a hundred mil. A mountain of useful plot info was untapped making the movie confusing for the uninitiated, and unsatisfying for readers of the book. Not a bad flick, but none too engaging either, TIMELINE is just kind of there. Read the book instead- it's far more cinematic and thrilling than the film."
5,I thinks it's pretty good,Great I finally got it. Wooh....oo. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. I would like to thank the customer service who helped get this.
4,Timeline is attention worthy.,"I bought Timeline for Gerard Butler, but got pulled into the story as well. the actors delivered truly believable performances and you were kept wondering what was going to happen next.The battle scenes were beautifully shot, you actually felt you were in the battle and could smell the smoke and the blood of battle. The photography and choice of locations left me spellbound. I had to watch this movie twice the first night."
1,just plain bad,"Ok so if you have never read the book then you might like this movie. However if you have read the book then you will hate this movie. i had read bad reviews about the movie but liked the book so much i said i'll give it a chance, i mean how bad can it be. Well Really bad was my answer. whoever wrote the screen play for this movie i dont think ever read the book. its more like he read the back of the book and said ok thats all the info i need. bottom line great book bad movie."
4,Rough cut or final film?,"In late July, I had the opportunity to attend a screening of this film while in L.A. The trouble with advanced screenings, you're never sure if you're seeing a final cut, a rough cut, or something which will be retooled based on audience response. Overall, my impression was that it was closer to a final cut than anything else.The plot finds several 21st century archeologists in 15th century France, on a mission to rescue their mentor. The Professor was sent back and left for dead by the Bill Gates-like mogul who stumbled upon the time travel technology.Director Richard Donner seems set on a low-tech approach to the special effects. A refreshing change in these days of everything being CGI. While a bit predictable at points, the story flows fairly well and makes for a fun time at the movies."
4,Fun movie,"""Timeline"" by Michael Crichton is one of my favorite books! The movie is just slightly different (due to time constraints), but it is a well done and fun movie. The costumes are awesome, and finding out they used a real castle and real trebuchets made the movie even more interesting for me. The acting, for the most part was good, but could have been better. I would like to see this movie done with a better cast...Brad Pitt as Chris, Sean Connery as the Professor, Cameron Diaz as Kate, Antonio Banderas as Andre Marek, and Seth Green as David Stern, would be my top picks to star in a remake!I thought the effects were great! This is just a fun to watch movie, with a great story and I could watch it many times without losing interest. Great movie for teens to pique their interest in history and/or science fiction too."
2,"Cool castle siege, that's all","There's some cool scenes of a nighttime siege on a castle with flaming projectiles flying back and forth and some interesting glimpses of Medieval warfare--some really well-done historical recreation in that department--but the rest of the movie is just plain silly, and some of the acting is pretty bad, and a lot of the acting is really bad, and obviously the director is pretty sad if he just let slide so much bad. Probably a movie for teenage boys. I probably would have liked it when I was a teenager and lacked an age-earned discriminating eye. For teenage girls? Well, that's for a woman to say. There's a cute, although preposterous, romance mixed in. Medievalists might like owning a copy for the recreations. My copy's going to the used bookstore if they'll give me a buck for it."
2,"Someone, Please Try This Again","I read the book first and loved it so much that I purchased the DVD. But there were so many variations from the book that viewing the movie was less than enjoyable. I'm not saying that a movie needs to be exactly like the book, word for word. But the entire theme and plot was changed around. An actual father/son relationship was forged between the professor and Chris that was completely unnecessary. In fact, it added a sort of cheesiness to the movie that I couldn't overlook.I was not happy with this movie. However, I am not writing this review to bash the movie. I hope that this review and others like it would spur another writing, direction and production team (or even the same team) to film this movie again and really do the book justice."
3,Watch the bonus features,"This is a curate's egg of a movie- an excellent cast, experienced and successful director and good action scenes meet up with a lame screenplay, dreadful script and mindboggling lack of credibility. Who wins? You'll have to watch it to find out whether, for you, the good outweighs the bad.A hint might be that I'd certainly have given it no more than 2 stars, maybe even only one, had it not been for the special features. The documentary on the making of the film is a riot, far more entertaining than the movie itself. Donner comes into his own as he interacts with the cast, crew and the audience. It made the few dollars I spent on the movie more than worthwhile."
2,Low budget and cheesey,"The only reason I could watch a little of this was because of the eye candy: Paul Walker and Gerard Butler. But the movie was low budget, horrible and cheesey."
3,Still worth watching,"Paul Walker is laughably horrific in his lead performance, but the presence of the ever charismatic Gerard Butler and Billy Connoly save the film from disaster. Kate's character is played very poorly by a good actress, a fact which disappoints on several levels. Of course the book is far better than the film, but for those of us who can't completely grasp all the scientific concepts alluded to in the novel, the movie serves the purpose of giving you the bare basics. The fact that the movie disregards the common knowledge that modern French and English are far different from their Medieval counterparts is further exacerbated by the pathetic ""Frenchman"" of their group. However, the historical romance between Marek and Lady Claire steal the show and bring this film from a taudry piece of poorly written scripting into a likeable film I'm willing to watch often enough to warrant purchasing."
3,They sure messed up the book badly,"It is still a good sci fi time travel movie,even if they parched the novel badly.The devil is in the details and they left outso many that a lot is lost.This novel with the archaeology was one of Chichton's best.He actually seemed to care about his characters and subject material.The lead character of the archaeologist who could use a long bow and a swordis truncated to a bit lover story without the backgroundof the interaction between Lady Clair and him.Changing history and the greed of the company back inreal time are sort of glossed over...I like the movie anyway, by halves."
2,Avoid this one...,"I must agree with most who say the acting in this movie was beyond sub par. The script made little sense and had so many plot holes that it was hard to stick with it to the end. If there is a God, Paul Walkers' movie career should end here. His ""whoa, dude"" style of performance was completely out of place in the film, and I really doubt that he has the talent to pull off any other type of role. Avoid [...] and hopefully Crichton will have the sense to be more careful when green-lighting adaptations of his novels."
2,tricked again,"i thought the ad made it look kind of good, but it ended up being very bad. the characters suck and it is almost 2 hours. There was some decent action though."
1,"For the love of God, avoid this movie","Dear God!!!! I don't normally write online reviews. Doing so just isn't my thing. But this movie was absolutely HORRID!!! The book was SO MUCH better. Now, Hollywood is pretty much known for butchering novels through movie adaptations, but this was relentless. The incredible detail and enlightening, thoughtful entertainment of Crichton's novel is WIPED OUT and PARED DOWN so that Paul Walker can have a starring vehicle. I have nothing against Paul Walker, but this just wasn't the movie for him. In fact, I envisioned a totally different cast for a story of this magnitude. This movie goes beyond oversimplification of the novel. On it's own, it's just BAD. It is a 1950's B-movie masquerading as a big budget studio production. I might have found it entertaining if it didn't try to take itself so damned seriously, which it was sort of doomed to do since it was SUPPOSED to be based on the Crichton novel."
2,Let's go a digging!,"Seeing snippets of this film on TV aroused my curiosity, but that was all.Billy Connoly's archaeology professsor character is a disgrace to the profession, claiming the Hundred year ended a century too early, and trampling all over excavation sites.Thankfully the good Prof goes missing before he does history any further mischief. Not that you actully notice anyway, until someone tells you he has been gone for 2 weeks.The characters are poorly developed, and are usually killed before you can get to know them.Those that aren't spend most of thier time climbing on buildings, and smashing up walls. One decides to rescue a French girl (Anna Friel with a very bad accent), from the nasty English who kill the French for sport (after having ran out of deer.)The film relies on non-stop action, as opposed to telling good storytelling.So for two hours the baddies chase peasants, stab people, burn houses and dangle women from battlements. All because they are English of course. Reason enough."
3,Great Story-Weak Actors,"Timeline sheds light on a team of archaeologists and marksmen sent back in time to recover the lead professor in a dig taking place in France. The new setting is now 1357, France, during the Hundred Years War between the French and the English; not the best time to be visiting the Continent...There are slight hints of Stargate and Timecop so the movie falls into the action/adventure/sci-fi type of category.In short, the acting and the dialogues are rather weak, while the plot and the setting, are really very good!Strangely, one gets the feeling that the film was made for television and not the big screen.In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it."
4,A trip through history,This movie is great. I enjoy it because I am 1) a history buff 2) a Gerard Butler fan and 3) I like the entertainment level. This movie looks corny from the previews but it is worth seeing it just to be entertained for two hours.
3,A good movie,"""Its not like the book! It's not like the book!"" Okay, Michael Creighton fans can stop crying, the film is not as accurate as it could be - but after all, when has there ever been a novel-based film that followed the book to everyone's liking?Anyway, its an energized film with great effects and a cool plot. Paul Walker's performance is predictable (lots of ""Woah""'s and ""Bro""'s) but, overall, convincing. This film is definitely worth having for the price. Gerard Butler plays a good Merrick, and there are lots of other actors that no one knows the names of but have seen everywhere (""Hey, isn't that the guy from..."")Overall, good effects, good story, and descent performances."
2,Simplfied Diet,"We had order Simplified Diet 10th Edition, The State of Iowa reguires ue to have one . We recieved it in a very timely manner. We didn't open it until last week to find out it was the 6th edtion. I realise we should of inspected the book when we recoeved it. My dietary supervisor makes out out menu's a month ahead so we didn't need it until the end of October.Last week she order the 10th edition which should arrive Nov. 2-3.Rosebush Gardens Assisted LivingMary Michelle Van Dolah Administer"
2,Poor engineering dooms this one.,"Much as a like Judy Carmichael's stride piano style, this recording is a disappointment. The piano is fine, especially on the solo numbers, though several of those are available elsewhere on her solo recordings. But the guitar is barely audible, especially on the Hoagy Carmichael medley, and the trumpet volume is all over the lot, sometimes about right, but sometimes nearly drowned out by the piano. Judy Carmichael should not have allowed this disc to be issued in this condition. Wish I had my money back."
5,The Adoption Mystique,"Because I am an adoptee who searched and found my biological family, I read Joanne Small's book ""The Adoption Mystique"" with great interest. Ms. Small has done a masterful job of debunking the propaganda the adoption industry spews out. We do not need or want the ""protection"" forced upon us by industry. In a country like ours that places such a high value on personal freedom, it is a shame that there is a necessity for writing such a book as this! This is a ""must read"" book for adoptees, birth and adoptive parents alike."
1,maybe good for kids,"I got this book because it was new and the author co-authored another book that was highly rated. Well, it is not for me. I figure I can't really expect much from 150 pages in large print that starts with what an option is. Too bad a preview or even a table of content was not available when I placed my order.These are what the book does not talk about:1. Pricing models2. Greeks3. Any form of formula4. Implied volatilityIt is meant for people who learn about options the first time, has middle-school level or lower math skills, and can read simple non-technical English. The most advanced math concept in the book is the square root. The book's idea is basically using leaps as an alternative to buy-and-hold."
5,Use LEAPS as surrogate,"I bot this DVD cuz it was inexpensive at less than $5. Since I do not want to pay $5,000 +/- for some of the fancy high tech, etc., classes, I have been buying these used and out of date info sources (books, DVDs, webinars)and it has worked well for me. This one was worth it cuz it showed me how to use a LEAP as collateral of a covered call instead of owning the stock itself. I have the idea and now I will play with implementation.Another plus for using Amazon is that now I have a product that I can view repeatedly and can share with friends."
5,This is a fantastic new show.,I love that it uses so many of the same themes as Mr. Rogers but still reinvents itself for a new generation. My toddler son loves the show and so do I.
2,Daniel Striped Tiger Videos,"Probably my mistake....I misunderstood what I was getting....I wanted a DVD and I did not understand that this would be sent to my computer. Would like to return it, but not sure how...can I send it to my daughter's computer address??? It's really for my grandson.Thanks, Pat Ryandrpatryan@gmail.com"
5,Best children's show in a long time.,"This is the best children's show out there today. As a parent who grew up watching Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, it is wonderful to see his legacy continuing in such a worthwhile show. Unlike Dora, Diego, or Max and Ruby, there is an authority figure with the children almost constantly and helping them learn valuable life lessons. The songs are very catchy and my 3 year old is often singing them. I have also found that this show deals with issues for young children that I can not recall being done before, ie separation anxiety. Also, Daniel stresses that you can imagine and lets you know that is exactly what he is doing.I wish there were more shows like this one!"
5,Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,"My little 2 1/2 year old grandson and I love these ""ride-a-longs"" with Daniel Tiger and his friends. When I want to begin or finish a 30 minute chore or project, I simply turn on Daniel Tiger.In addition to being extremely entertaining,the videos are also very educationalI believe Mr. Rogers would have certainly approved!"
5,LOVE it,Daniel tiger is a loved tv show and charecter in my family. I have 4yr old and 6yr old boys who love watching daniel tiger!!
5,Typical Good Western Digital,"Western Digital has remained my drive of choice for the past 10 years. This drive did not let me down, it is quiet and fast and has had no problems for past year and half. Installation was simple and quick. I also have a 30G Seagate and it too is fast and easy to set up but is more noisy. One advantage to buying the retail box version is you get the UDMA ribon."
3,Great Little Drive,"Western Dig has made great drives for the last five years. Prior years were questionable, but these new drives are just fine for the home user. The easy to use utilities make the hard drive switch a snap! Enjoy!"
1,Buy a Maxtor,"Piece of garbage. I tried to save a few bucks, now I regret it. The drive failed after only 6 weeks in my system. Had to reinstall my old drive while I wait 7-10 business days for a replacement I don't want."
2,Disappointing,I am a first time reader of Heather Graham and will not be ordering another of her books. The heroine was unlikable and I just couldn't get into the love story. How could he love such a shrew? This story would be better suited to a Harlequinn Romance instead of a novel.
2,disappointed,"I ordered this book in advance because I enjoyed Drop Dead Gorgeous and Tall, Dark and Deadly so much. I really couldn't wait until to read this book because I assumed it would be just as suspenseful and page-turning.I just felt this book was very slow-moving and I just wanted to be done with it. I really didn't get attached with any of the characters and the story line just seemed too predictable."
2,Very Disappointed!,"Not the usual great book from Heather Graham. The heroine was a complete ninny and the story line was very very weak. I really love her books, normally, but I had to struggle to finish this clunker."
2,Not up to par,"This story was not vintage Heather Graham. It was a weak story line right from the beginning. It was almost as though she had to write something, and this was the result. Heather Graham is a wonderful writer, but this story does not do her repetoire justice. It was weak and frankly quite dull. This reader is looking forward to the sequel to Ms. Graham's vampire series."
1,"Sorry, but this book STUNK !","This one was worse than the other Heather Graham romantic suspense novels I read, the title of which I can't even remember! Even more so than the other one I read, this one was written extremely simplistically, almost on a young-adult level. I don't like this author's style of writing, at least her contemporary-romance-suspense novels. And this one had a stupid story, with no development of the characters, so I couldn't care less about any of them. The twist at the end, while a surprise to me, was, well, stupid. The character who turned out to be the ""bad guy"" and why he was the bad guy were contrived. It seemed like the author wrote herself into a corner and ""had"" no choice when it came down to who turned out to be her ultimate ""bad guy"" and why. I would steer clear of this author for contemporary romantic suspense."
4,Lotus Guide Magazine Review,"Limitless Mind: A Guide to Remote Viewing and Transformation of ConsciousnessBy Russell TargISBN 1-57731-413-1, New World LibraryAs science validates such things as nonlocality and healing at a distance, it is interesting to read a book that gives you actual time-tested techniques. After reading Russell Targ's book, it's easy to see that we are just now starting to understand the limitless human capacity in the realms of conscious evolution. Whether you're a meditator, medical intuitive, or just interested in experiencing your own limitless existence, this guide will provide valuable information.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide MagazineTo Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social and Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems"
2,Misleading Title: Beats around the bush and goes nowhere.,"I thought I had purchased a guide to remote viewing. Instead 80% of the pages are brimming with personal experiences I could care less about, 101 methods on how to quiet the mind and an overview of 10 most spiritual men!If I had wanted a book on calming my mind I would have purchased something with ""YOGA"" in the title. If I cared for a biography on Mr. Targ I would have purchased one. And if I was into Hari Crishna I would have time traveled to the 70's!This book was a waste of time and money. The only ""method"" the author gives could be explained in a single page, 200 word office memo. ""Place a thing in a bag; go into the other room...""-What? That's it? -The title is totally misleading!"
3,meh..,"I heart the author on one of Jim Harold's shows and decided to check out his book. It's interesting to me that he claims that the remote viewing program in the military was a huge success, yet they most likely have it still disbanded. Let me tell you, if it worked, they'd keep it going. His stories, like getting the jackpot at Vegas, are in my opinion just that. I heard on a podcast earlier this year (2012) about how a group of remote viewers, supposedly the best of the best, claim that the US was going to have some economic disaster reemerge in March 2012. Never happened. Lots of things never happen. Then when one thing goes right, oh a miracle!The book is interesting and well written. I simply don't buy into it at all. Spend your money on something a little less fishy."
5,Live Bullet,I had this on vinyl when it first came out-I realize now just now much I really liked Seger. This album is so much better Nine Tonight. I have always enjoyed the song Ramblin Gamblin Man. I also like the tune UMC (United Mens Club) neither song is on the Nine Tonight CD. Beautiful Loser -Great Song. Bo Diddley totally Rocks!!!!! This CD is why they make 300Watt receivers. Play this CD and Crank it up.
4,"Very enjoyable, but...","I thought this book was very well written and entertaining. I do have two comments however. First, I thought it was at its best when the Ray and/or Jewel were actually at the casino, and less interesting when the plot veered away from that (although the John Larroquette scene certainly was funny). Also, I was somewhat confused as to what the author intended the reader to conclude as to the fate of the main protagonists. Was it: (a) they had overcome their gambling addiction and were going to live happily ever after? (b) they never overcame their addiction but were going to live happily ever after anyway? or (c) they couldn't overcome their addiction and were doomed to a life of misery and depression? Certain parts of the ending seem to point to each of these conclusions. Any thoughts?"
5,The Wall - The way it was meant to be heard,"Wow! I've been a Pink Floyd fan for many years and have listened to a few bootlegged shows of Pink Floyd, but NOTHING can compare to Is There Anybody Out There: The Wall Live. This is a CD which can be listened to without pause; every song is necessary in order to understand the story behind The Wall. Roger Waters' magical lyrics shine in each song and Dave Gilmour's blazing guitar work has never been better. Listening to the solos in Comfortably Numb and Mother made me feel like I was watching Gilmour playing a-top the wall. If you've never heard of Pink Floyd, purchase this album. If you're already a Floyd fan, purchase this album. I highly reccomend the limited edition box set - it comes with a hardcover booklet with pictures and commentary from Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason. A must in any music collection."
5,hey floyd fans,unbelievable. if u like floyd's wall or dark side of the moon you have to have this trust me. the original cd was amazing but this just adds to the excitement. the extra tracks are a must have and different versions of some songs were spectacular. so just sit down and listen. THE SHOW MUST GO ON!
3,Somewhat disappointed,"After hearing of this release, I was rather excited. While The Wall is not my favorite Pink Floyd CD (Wish You Were Here gets that honor), it contains some of my favorite songs. And, Pink Floyd stuff usually sounds better live.While the packaging is stellar (as usual from Storm Thorgerson), I found the sound quality and mixing to be lacking. For a live release, the crowd noise is almost non-existent. For example, after hearing live tapes of the Wall being played in New York in 1980, when Comfortably Numb began, you could hardly hear the music because the crowd was going insane. Here, the crowd isn't even there. The whole recording sounds very un-energetic to me. As I said, I usually enjoy live Floyd renditions better than their studio counterparts, but I can't say that for even a single song on this disc - I'd much rather listen to the studio version.Still, it is very interresting to have an official live CD of this - if only the sound was better."
3,ZZzzzz...I've heard this before.,"This was a good CD, yea. But you might as well just listen to the original and then watch the movie, and you're getting the same thing. Floyd doesn't sound nearly as good in concert. I recommend you get the original CD and watch the movie. Much better idea than buying a highly commercialized new Pink Floyd CD that is based on past recordings."
4,Pink Floyd the wall/is there anybody out there?,This is a great album!!!!!! a great representation of Pink Floyd's best stuff!!!!!!!! This and Dark side of the moon are my favorite Pink Floyd Albums...actually im over 13 but this format just seemed easier....cause im lazy
1,If you got spare cash-,"Ive listened to the wall so many times its become like background music since ""they"" havent released PF in SACD or 5.1 I thought maybe this could bring the thrill back- not really there are minute differances but if you have to work for a couple hours to pay for this it isnt worth it- if money (MONEY) dont mean anything then go for it otherwise there isnt anything to see here."
5,If you like Pink Floyd buy it,"If you like Pink Floyd this is for you. If you enjoyed PULSE and Delicate Sound, then you need this album. Its amazing, the improvisations really add to the music as you'd expect live Floyd to do. Its a must have if you're a fan of The Wall. Not my favorite album by them, but this owns as a live album."
3,The bootlegs are still better.,"As happy as I am that a live version has finally been released, I feel that they missed the mark. Having had two bootlegs of The Wall live for more than 15 years I cringed when I first read how the album would be assembled. By looking for the ""best"" performances from different years and doing so much work to clean up the sound, the albums sounds more like a studio performance, with some extra echo and noise, than a live performance. What always impressed me with the bootlegs was that you could feel the energy from the band and the crowd and that feeling is missing from a lot of songs on the official live version.Yes, the ""extra"" songs are great and the book is fantastic but I think they would have had a better product if they had just picked one show and mixed it differently.If you really want to hear The Wall live, track down a copy of the L.A. Sports Arena show..."
1,Careful what you get!,"The music is great, the bad rating is for Amazon. Although I've ordered the limited edtion, I received the ""simple"" editon. Of course, I got my money my money back (thanks for that) but I still wanted the limited edition. When I contacted Amazon, they've told me there is no way to ensure that I'll get the right edition and that it seems there is a problem with this product."
1,Get real,"I'm not giving The Wall one star, but I'm giving this release one star. The Wall is one the best albums in music history, but we've heard many The Walls: The original one (1979), a movie, different versions by different members from Pink floyd for more than 30 years. It's enough people. We cannot look at Pink Floyd through The Wall only and after 30 years. Will they try to come up with something new close to level of The Wall? Is it not more productive if they give a real effort for a new album instead of reissuing The Wall? Will you be giving them 5 stars for any version of The wall? Do you suggest (by giving 5 stars) that Pink floyd should continue to re- release The Wall for another 30 years? Get real, we do not need this one. Do not get me wrong. Pink floyd is my favorite band. A band which came up with many great albums is certainly capable of producing some new nice music. I'm sorry, this release is to deceive their fans."
3,commerz,"This released cd is also the same case like Led zeppelin re-released cd's. FLOYD had become on of the most commercial rock bands besides Zeppelin in history,...they needed money to support their calculation in the tax revenure office."
4,Live Version of the Wall a Good Choice,The live version of the Wall is a must have for advid fans of Pink Floyd. Seeing the group perform in years(decades) past gives me an appreciation for any of their music recored live on a CD. Its that simple.
4,The Live Show that Took Pink Floyd Aparted!,"The Wall live is by far one of the most spectacular live show ever produced by any rock groups. The stage show, and the sound are almost incredible. Pink Floyd tried to captured every sounds possible in the studio and put it out on the live stage. Well, The amount of works did take a toll of pink floyd. It is irony that Roger Waters hate the concept of live show. And You know the rest of Pink Floyd history.. Anyway, This album is very good but it is the album that remind me of Pink Floyd's darkest days.."
5,Fantastic- a must for Wall fans,"I just got my copy of the limited edition today and I'm listening to it for the second time while I'm writing this. The quality of the recording is fantastic; at times, it's easier to hear the lyrics here than on the studio album. It goes without saying that the addition of ""What Shall We Do Now"", which I've always loved in the Wall movie, makes this album a must have for fans. In other aspects, hearing ""In The Flesh,"" which addresses the band vs. audience theme of Roger's and know that there is actually an audience there gives a whole new dimension to the song. Treat yourself to the limited edition- the book that comes with it, which holds the CD's, is a definite collector's item, with pics and written takes on the Wall from all the band members as well as the production team. All in all, it's an excellent rendition of The Wall."
5,Shocking and awe inspiring piece of work,"We all know The Wall with it's memorable lyrics and enchanting melodies. Now take a step deeper into the music, imagine it played live. The live performance beats life through all the classic songs. This album is a documented piece of Rock and Roll History."
4,Unbelievable!,Pulse was great because it was Pink Floyd live but they were missing one thing: Roger Waters. This man's vocals on this cd are ten times better than Gilmour's on Pulse. This is one of the greatest bands ever and they really show it. And anyone that says that Pink Floyd is out of style... has no idea what good music sounds like.
5,Worth Another Car Stereo,"I recently had my car stereo stolen. I promised never, ever to get a car stereo again, specially not the kind I had, a really expensive one. Then, this morning, I got my copy of ""Is There Anybody..."" Let me just say: All in all it's just Another Car Stereo in the Works...It sounds as crisp as the original (I should know, I'm 30 already!)...But if you listened to this record for the first time when you were in high-school, you remain forever 12, forever pissed-off : Good!...Besides, they should put a warning label on this CD: ""Contains no ""Live"" simplification of ""Tricky"" studio sounds."" Unlike many bands, PF doesn't just play a ""sketchy"" live version of their studio work... listen carefully and they even manage to throw some new layers of sound, especially when they build up towards Part 1..."
4,A new look at an old classic,"This live album might be redundant (the track list includes a the live performance of ""The Wall"" and nothing more), but if you love the original album, the live version will have you hearing it in a whole new way. The most valuable thing for fans might be the two booklets that come with the CD featuring numerous photos of the stage show and interviews with the major players, including all four band members. Even the normally reclusive Roger Waters chimes in on what is, after all, his masterpiece. What would REALLY be valuable is a DVD of the show. That would be true entertainment for any Pink Floyd fan."
3,Stick to the Studio,"A live performance is never able to capture the true sounds of studio experimentation, Floyd is no exception. Is There Anybody Out There? is not as durable and lacks sound quality that is present in The Wall. Buy this album because it's Floyd, but don't expect it to replace the true essence of a studio Floyd."
5,The way it was meant to be...,Terrific! The Wall heard the way it should be... Don't get me wrong I won't be throwing my studio version out anytime soon but to hear the ENTIRE Wall soundtrack with both Roger and Dave is incredibly fresh. Will be in the top 10 very soon.. Not bad for 20 year old songs..
3,OK,Pulse and Delicate Sound of Thunder are better. A video of this would have added to the experience. A good live album though.
3,What happened?,"PF live sounds are usually much better than this. It sounds so close to the original wall without anything different outstanding. I was very excited when this album was released, but after listening to it, it just doesn't compare to ""Pulse"" and ""The delicate sound of thunder."" I was disappointed. My first disappointing PF album since ""Ummagumma"""
5,perfect gift,"This book and CD set is perfect. I bought it as a gift for a long time fan and it was a hit. If you truly appreciate Pink Floyd, then this is a must. You'll treasure it."
5,Yes there are people out there.,Over the years I have liked some of the Pink Floyd music but have never been a great fan; but I have really enjoyed this album. I first heard it played on the radio one evening a few weeks ago while I was sitting in traffic. Looked over to the car next to me and the guy driving was singing along with great gusto to the same track I was listening to..
5,Outstanding,"Great album! I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall and I love these CDs. Sound quality is just about perfect for a live album. If you like The Wall, you'll love this album."
5,Money Well Spent,Here I thought this was going to be a double CD in one of those cheap 2 CD jewel cases. And I thought the price was a little extreme! Man was I wrong! I recieved my copy today and was very impressed.The music is fantastic and the packaging unbelievable.This is money well spent!
5,Nice Item Nice Price,I never expected to get a 25' Networking cable for 3.48. It is a true real deal. Thank You Very Much for the offering. Pat and Barb. Pats Photography.
5,Perfect-exactly what I needed.,"It was exactly what I needed--perfect length, no problems. I am happy to have purchased it."
1,Laughable - don't do it!,"The case really is twice as wide as it should be, so it doesn't hold the phone by friction. The magnet on the clasp is very weak and very difficult to locate in the only location where it will wort of lock, but if you catch it on anything, even brush it, then it's open again. It has a tendency to then sag open and dump your expensive and shiny phone on the ground. I don't know what Motorola is thinking shipping a thing like this. Since there are so few decent solutions for this phone, none that I've found, I'm thinking of stitching velcro to this one to make it work.Useless. Pathetic."
2,Moto makes great phones and aweful cases.,"I'm starting to agree with the guy who said that Motorola makes bad cases so we'll break our phones and buy new ones. I bought this for my KRZR, but didn't like it, because it kept dropping my phone, so I got the vertical version of this case. It broke after about 3 weeks of use, so I went back to this one. The stitching is falling apart, the magnet is weak and doesn't line up, and the case sometimes seems like it was designed for a bigger phone.The elastic and stitching is almost complete worn out after less then 2 months of use.When I bought this and the vertical case, there weren't many cases to choose from for the KRZR. I hope that isn't the situation now, as I begin my search again."
4,21st Century power-pop,"I picked this up a few days ago and am just now getting into it.Favorites so far are ""Girl With X-Ray Eyes"" and ""Improbable Solution"". Great stuff for riding around on a warm spring day."
4,"A RICH SELECTION, BUT A POOR PACKAGE","Someone took the trouble to select some less obvious choices; for example, Eddie Cantor is accompanied first by Jay Wilbur, then by Ambrose; Bing is accompanied by the Dorsey Brothers, and Irving Aaronson, and duets with Connie Boswell; and Adelaide Hall is accompanied not just by ""Two Pianos"" but by Francis J. Carter & Bennie Paine. So it is a pity that the discography is somewhat skimpy, and that there is not a liner note to fill out the background."
2,Watch it to goof on it,"This movie is possibly the cheesiest movie of all time. The movie steals from Mission Impossible and the Matrix while adding glamour shots that are so hokey you get a little sick to your stomach.But if you look at this movie in its proper context: A ton of money and time and effort was spent on a movie that tries to be Dumb, then maybe you can enjoy it.It's too silly, ridiculous, and cheesy to take seriously. It's impossible to care about, but fun to watch. You'll probably be making fun of the movie throughout. It bugs me to see so much time and effort be put forth for something so absolutely stupid, but some people think stupid is great.Watch it on free TV."
1,Charlie's hair-flipping-obssessed Angels!,"This movie is one of the worst ever. Well, if you're a guy, at least you could possibly derive some satisfaction from ogling the girls. But if not, hell, the plot is predictable, the girls annoying -- much of their screen time is devoted to flipping their hair. I wanted to scalp them by the time the movie was through. The action sequences spells The Matrix. No originality, cheesy characterization, boring plot, and loads of hair-flipping. Eeeeew."
2,An old thought made over,"This movie seems to play off of the usual guy(expect this time its all chicks, to make its more of a chick action flick) action movies in which shows a lot of people being beat up, the usual main characters trying to figure things out, and of course explotions. But the storyline itself is hardly even there, which is very disapointing. Acting in this movie isn't very good but is good enough to pass as a character who doesn't know the camera is in front of them, but barely good enough. Directing in this movie is the only good thing that has come out of this movie"
1,Michelle Yeoh does it better......,"Bad script, bad action, and bad acting. What were they thinking? The best thing about this film was the opening when fans got to see the stunning Jacklyn Smith -- who still looks better than all the actresses in this film. Even Michele Yeoh does all her stunts while these ladies need a wire to hoist their heavy, out-of-shape bottoms off the ground. So much for reality in American fight films."
1,"""Oh....My....God!""","This film is so bad in every way it actually makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" look like ""Citizen Kane!"""
2,Pathetic angels,"Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are pathetics as clone of Jet Li.Give us back the real Charlie's angels...."
3,Angels On High,"An interesting, if not totally predictable take off on the television series of the same name. The acting was so-so, especially Bill Murray as Bosley.The action sequences were breath-taking. An art form in itself. Although totally unbelievable, the choreography was brilliant. This film and DVD are visually stunning. If viewed strictly for entertainment value and gratuitous sexuality, then a worthwhile investment of your leisure time. Also good for a few laughs."
4,GIRLS RULE!!...,"Charlie's Angels is a good action/comedy because it shows that girls can take care of themselves, AND THEY CAN KICK BUT TO!!..."
3,Action packed,"Action packed, but lacking in plot. This is a good movie, full of action... but quite a bit on the silly-side! The stunts are ridiculous, and so are the personalities and relationships. But all in all, it was a fun movie to watch. I'm a big Bill Murray fan, and this movie is just his style... except he's in a supporting role this time."
1,Worse than the TV show,"This is one of the worst movies to come out recently, but is that really a surprise? Drew Barrymore is in the flick and it was modeled after an insipid '70s television show. Do you need any more warnings?"
1,CHARLIE'S GOING NOWHERE,"THis is the kind of movie that will have s hort selling life. It has no mouth-to-mouth divulgation, because people soon realize it's an empty product,a mere vehicle to show the ""beauty"" of Barrymore, Diaz and Liu. It's a disgrace to Hollywood, an example of what a movie should not be."
1,I wonder ...,"I see the reviews of this movie and I wonder if we were seeing the same movie. Perhaps that worst movie of the year!! The acting was bad, the plot was bad, the humor was a poor attempt at campy ... just a big bust. Again, another movie that throws big name actors / actress and that should be enough to carry the movie. It was nothing like the original TV series and it was not even good on it's own merit. I have watched some bad movies before ... but they are usually ""B"" movies and you somewhat expect that. In this case, it was as bad as most ""B"" movies, if not worse. I cannot understand the 4 and 5 star ratings that people give this move. It was bad."
2,Tries *way* too hard,"This movie tries too hard to *not* take itself seriously. Obviously the TV series the movie was based on wasn't the height of cinematic perfection but was entertaining enough on a Saturday night to waste an hour. The movie spends too much time making fun of the series and not enough doing what at good movie should do which is tell a story. Some of the ""in"" jokes were fine but there were so many of them it was more of a distraction than funny. The action scenes tended to go over the top to the point where there wasn't even any hope of being believable. And while we are at it can we stop imitating ""The Matrix"" now? It's getting old.The actresses do a good job as the Angels and Bill Murray as Bosley was a good choice. Tom Green as Drew Barrymore's boyfriend was just plain annoying.This is a mildly entertaining movie that is worth renting if you enjoyed the series but nothing beyond that."
1,Bad,"One-half hour into this movie I guessed the entire plot - what little there was of one. Charlie swears his Angels are brilliant but there's nothing to back that here. Lots of cleavage and action, if you like movies like this, so be it. It was bad if you ask me."
2,Not Worth Buying!,"Entertaining fluff, worth one viewing but no more. That's probably why there are 40 used copies available as I write this review! Rent it at your local vid store, take it back, and move on to something better!"
2,WORST SO-CALLED REMAKE,"I finally gave in and rented the video and decided to be opened minded and give this film a chance. I grew up in the '70s so I knew the original ""Charlie's Angels"" t.v. show well. I normally like Cameron Diaz as an actor, But what was she thinking in doing this film?! The plot was unstable, the acting was poor and Bosely's part,played by Bill Murray, was turned into a mockery. Drew Barrymore could have ""produced"" a good remake or made a decent updated one, but she did it very sloppy instead. Why, was this film allowed out on screen? Especially considering most films,even the good ones, are often shelved before their debut. They should be forced to rename the title.The music was good."
1,Please Stay Away from this Film. Spend Your Money Elsewhere.,"If not one of the worst movies, near one of the worst movies I paid to see in years. Luckily, I avoided tragedies like “Battlefield Earth,” but I digress. This movie demonstrates everything that is wrong with modern cinema, asides from the cell phone and the idiot next to you who insists on talking into it during the movie.Rather, this piece of junk, and I’m being judicious, lacks all merit. It was not original. Not simply the title, concept or execution, but right down to the action and fight scenes. These scenes were a bad mixture of Mission Impossible meets Asian Martial Art films doing wire stunts.This movie lacked any sense of theme or cohesion. One second, I’m in a disco with Cameron Diaz and next with Lucy Liu and her death muffins. And yes, I got the concept that this is meant to be a bit campy, which makes it worse! This movie keeps asking am I a big action flick or a camp film."
4,Very light and fun,"Sometimes you're just in the mood to watch a movie and not have to think. I knew what the movie was about, so that's what my expectations were. I found it to be very light and funny. The scene where they were dressed as swiss girls delivering a singing telegram had me on the floor. I would definately recommend it."
5,Angel's Directly from Heaven,"Maybe I am speaking from the perspective of all shallow, easily pleased and lusty young men that may have seen this movie. But I am also looking at this movie as a dedicated film goer. This flick is mighty impressive, in every way. The plot is thin but who needs it?? Gorgeous people performing unbelievable stunts in an action packed movie that provides more excitement than a massage down at Madame Lou Lou's Shag Pad!!! Its great fun and if you don't come out smiling after seeing this flick you need to be ordering a hell of a lot more prozac from your therapist!!!The sound track adds to the excitement as a constant provider of wild thumping tunes that only adds the fast paced, insane and incredibly sexy vibe that this movie produces..Go see, go smile, go enjoy, go ogle, but just go...Buy this DVD and have a good time."
3,The Angels were not so good this time.,"CHARLIE'S ANGELS is the 2000 remake of the popular 70's TV show. Cameron Diaz (Any Given Sunday), Drew Barrymore (The Wedding Singer) and Lucy Liu star in the film.MY REVIEW:""This film is cheap and just a comic book movie of THE MATRIX mixed with girl humor. The movie can be fun at times, and even cool with the kung fu special effects, but otherwise it's just a plain MATRIX with humor remake.""..."
5,Angels soar!,"This movie was so,so,so great.Cameron,Drew,and Lucy are three of my favorite actresses and they really show off there talent in this movie.The movie is very fast paced and doesn't get boring in places(unlike most action adventure movies).The acting was excelent.The plot was briliant.What more could you ask for in one film?Also,the DVD contains lots of fun extras which is a lot of fun.Don't pass this movie up,cuz it is really good."
1,The Most Over-Hyped & Disappointing Movie Of The Year 2000,"Please don't believe all the hype about Charlie's Angels. The movie was weak and not worthy of buying ( rent only ). The movie was very unsatisfying and typical. Basically you watch 3 barbie dolls say catch phrases and beat up soft villians. The action in the movie was not like I expected. I am tired of movies trying to be like The Matrix & Mission Impossible etc... The movie clearly did not try to bring anything new to the action scene. Crazy and stupid plot twists (just like The Matrix/Mission Impossible/Art Of War etc...) also help make this film fail to bring any originality. Please, if you have not already seen this movie and you're going to see it, don't get your hopes and expectations too high. ( Rent Only )"
3,good popcorn movie,"Charlie's Angels had great sound and I didn't notice any pixilation. The only real downside, and it kept me from giving a higher rating, is that it lacked a scene selection. This has to be a must for any PSP movie"
3,Kicken it Angel style!,"tHIS MOVIE SIZZILES! iT HAS ACTION,COMEDY,and romance!Get some action with Charlies Angels!"
5,Why not but...,I was expecting a LOT in this action movie. It is a nice movie. Nothing more. You spend an OK 1:30 hours but nothing more.Look at it but not to buy. Watch it once not more.
3,Silly Sexy Fun,"I did not expect much when i put this DVD in the player and found myself surprised. No, this was not a great film by any means, but it was it silly, sexy fun. If you don't take it serious you are in for an ok 90 minutes.Once again, Cameron Diaz shows why she is one of the hottest females in film. Her charecter is silly and comes off as a ""dumb blonde"", but she is oh so easy on the eyes."
4,Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors.,He did a great job in this film. You never would have guessed he was actually the bad guy in the end.
3,'Angels' are Heavenly Creatures,"But are these girls real angels? Look at Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. Decide for yourself... They are secret agents working for an unknown man named Charlie and their new mission has to do with a computer programmer whose been kidnapped. The guy is a complete dork. There's also a tall, skinny guy who likes to smell hair and you know he had an obsession with Barbies. One of the girls eats a lot and orders way too much at a drive-thru. One can't dance or sing (Soul Train has a bad reputation now because of this girl). One can't cook muffins, which are deadly and can sit as a rock in your stomach, literally. Yet, they're all supposed to be 'angels.' Even at the beginning, an 'angel' was disguised as LL Cool J. Can you imagine that? The movie is deranged. They even threw in Bill Murray for some reason. Oh well, it's just entertainment."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected the movie to be somewhat like that TV show, but this turned out to be to comical with a weak and very unrealistic story line. In my opinion this movie made woman look like they are stupid and can get by on only looks and luck.The movie is about 3 woman ""Charlie's Angels"" who take on a client that needs someone found. The movie takes its turns through an investigation, love plots and some rescues, but none to realistic.I think if there was a lot less comedy and more realism this movie could have been a lot better. This movie was a complete waste of time for me."
4,"Okay Plot, Great Fun","Good Morning Angels....Charlie's Angels, if you don't know, is about 3 women (Diaz,Barrymore,Liu) who work for a mysterious man who know one has met by the naem of Charlie. They also have a sidekick, Bosley (Billy Murray) to help them. The plot is rather blah, but the action, comedy, and fun is at the maximum. The fight sequences are great! I love this movie and it is worth buying.Thank You"
5,The Angels are back!,"This movie is great. The action is amazing! The stunts are spectacular! Cameron Diaz as Natalie is hilarious! She's a perfect ditz. Drew Barrymore as Dylan is a tough chick who can take out several men with her hands tied. Lucy Liu as Alex is a smart tech-savvy woman who can bring men to her knees. Overall, Charlie's Angels was fun!"
2,not good,It reminded me of a mix between MI2 and Austin Powers! I am so glad I didnt spend 7.00 to see this at the theatre!!
2,"Spunky, but unrealistic","Although three hot chicks are in three hot uniforms pretending to be superheros, something about Charlie's Angels just doesn't click. Maybe its the pale villian, who licks hair (YUCK!!!!), or the plot itself. Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore are the brought back trio from the 70's know as Charlie's Angels. Women crime fighters, with very strange methods. The Angels are given an ordinary case, but it all goes haywire, when their communicator between them and Charlie(Murray)is kidnapped. Charlie's Angels is a good one time see, but its comedy is exhausted after the first view.Special appearances from Tom Green (Barrymore's Boyfriend) and Bill Murray liven the movie up a bit."
3,Very enjoyable for a once-only viewing,"If you're looking for a movie that's filled with light-hearted fun and harmless action, this is definitely a good pick. Bill Murray stars as Charlie's go-between and does a good job, in my opinion, of playing the humorous, cowardly-yet-corageous fatherly figure. Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore are well cast and work together on the screen convincingly, so that it wouldn't be entirely surprising if they had a real life secret ops gig on the side.The movie incorporates a good deal of ""Matrix-esque"" cinematography and borrows the kung fu style of the Matrix, as well as the ""secret and dangerous mission that requires lots of cool gadgets"" from the ""Mission Impossible"" movies. Here, however, the fighting and the cool gadgets are merely for effect to sell the movie, and don't lend anything new to the genre.But what do you expect? This is a fun movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who don't like cheesy lines or improbable situations, as this movie is full of them."
2,See Chicken Run or Titan A.E. Instead,"I wasn't impressed with this video. Some of the fighting and special effects were neat (though not always believable), but the plot was unoriginal. The computer break-in scene reminds one very much of Mission Impossible (1). The storyline jumps and shifts too much for comfort, without being surprising -- as if someone up top couldn't settle on this version or that. And the girls run on sexy scenes -- sporting skimpy clothes and conveniently unzipped water suits -- instead of showing some real personality. The skin plus some questionable language makes ""Charlie's Angels"" unsuitable for family viewing.Too bad; the crime-fighting team, backed by an anonymous millionaire, wasn't that bad of an idea. And the way the girls obviously loved him, unseen, was cute too. The redhead's glimpse of Charlie, near the end, is poignant; you imagine she'll treasure that forever. Anyone interested in a remake?"
2,Was this a joke????,"OK, I rented Charlie's Angels cuz I heard it was funny, and I love Lucy Lui, shes a great actress. Was this a parody of the orginal Charlie's Angels? The script was poorly written, and half the technology they had could never be made. It was very unrealistic. I admit, some lines were funny, and some of the music was funny(Caviar and Blink182). I wish I could have seen more of Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green and Tim Curry. It was cool to see women superheos kick guys butts, but the script was just so poor. I would not recomend this movie to everyone."
5,Awesome!,"This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. It's clever, funny, and has a great story line. All the actresses are brilliant, I can't wait to buy the video - but don't trust me, do yourself the favour and see for yourself!"
1,Script was Written by 13-year old girls,"Look I don't understand what it is about charlies angels. I've seen the original episodes and it's just as cheesy as anything else in that era. I can accept strong women beating up bad guys, that's fine. In fact one of my favorite actresses is Michelle Yeoh. What I can't accept is how a woman who has no Skill,muscle, or physical strength can fly around kicking, and punch guys in a way I've only seen in the Matrix! Without wires there wouldn't be any fighting....The Plot and acting were awful....BR> So bottom line, Guys will like the movie because of Cameron Diaz(She's not that hot, but that's another article), And Women will like it if they need some Female action stars and don't care about Plot. I still think it [was bad]. But hey that's just me, I don't like to watch [bad movies]."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","I don't usually do reviews but this movie is so bad that I felt I had to warn my fellow viewers. I have nothing against trashy, even stupid movies... they can be quite fun. I certainly have nothing against sexy movies either. This one however has no redeeming qualities. It was painful to watch and when I finally shut it off about 3/4 of the way through, I was angry at having wasted my time. My wife disliked it almost as much as I did. If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and rent it first."
1,Stupidest movie ever!!!,"This movie is extremely stupid! The only point of this movie was so Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz could show off some skin! Don't get me wrong, I like Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz, but this was the worst movie I have ever seen! I rate it no stars."
3,A bit trashy.,This was A good movie but it was really trashy.Drew Barrymore should not have played the rebel tough person what ever you want to call it.It did not fit her at all.On some of the fighting parts they just cept going on and on and it was like ok stop already.I thought that Bill murray played A good bosley.
2,A film for the less fortunate,"This film does not have a plot, the acting is weak and the script is cliché. This modern adaptation rips parts off several other box office hits. It unsuccessfully tries to be funnny, I thought it was a spoof film but then someone told me it wasnt, I cringed. I guess a 12 year old could get some laughs out of it but it stops there, this is hollywood at its lowest, a simple film for simple minds. If you think this is a 5 star film...then wake up."
1,A slap in the face to moviegoers!,"The reason I gave this movie 1 star is because the option of negative three stars was not available. This movie sets a precedence for all bad movies to live up to. Not only was it plotless, I was unable to find any character developement. The fighting scenes would have been better choreographed by a muppetier. At least Miss Piggy has studied some martial arts. In it's defense the ladies were very sexy but Drew looked like she wolfed down a couple of cheese burgers before each take. I was happy to see George Mcfly still working and I did enjoy Cameron in her underroos. If you have no class or taste in movies you probably own this piece of art and the cheesy sound track. This movie was an insult to all those who appreciate good action/adventure flicks. I gave it a galacticly resounding thumbs down!!!!"
1,"Terrrible, Terrible.","This was dishonor towards all the women who had played in the original series. Don't get me wrong. The Tv series wasn't the Golden age of TV, but at least they gave a decent effort. This was a waste of time of and money. It had the look of maybe, Drew Barrymore, saying, ""Hey! Let's make a movie.""(Gee, I wonder if that accounts for an apparance by Tom Greene?). Hiring a video director doesn't help.I was also tempted to walk out on this movie, and I never have walked out out a movie in say, nearly 40 years. It was totally stupid. Buy it at own risk to your good taste."
2,NOT WORTH TO BUY,This film is not worth to see. Because the scenario is very bad and there are scenes that lack of logic. I am fed up with such that scenes in action films but in this movie it is overloaded with unlogic.The good thing is the soundtrack and cameron.
3,Much better than I thought!,"I can't believe I'm saying this. My wife wanted to rent this movie and I thought Oh brother! We also rented Meet the parents. I'm telling you this movie is much more enjoyable and funnier than meet the parents. Lots of cool Karate style action, like Matrix, and a lot of laughs coming from Bill Murray. The story is pretty stupid, but the characters make up for it. Diaz is a dumb blond. Lu is the smart one of the bunch. Barrymore, is O.K. someone else should have played this part. The worst thing about this movie is that Barrymore's Husband, boyfriend,- Tom Green has a couple of scenes and they are really bad! It was funny to see Charlie, just like the TV show I remember, is trying to hide his Identity. Good not a great movie."
5,This DVD is AWESOME!!!,"This is a DVD that NO ONE should miss. Lucy Liu rules, Cameron Diaz is awesome, and Drew Barrymore just rocks. This movie is filled with action and plenty of laughs. If you want to watch a great movie, watch this one!!"
4,"Fun, fun, fun!","As I had heard that Charlie's Angels was dumb fun, I went in expecting less than I got. Charlie's Angels is action-packed comedy, with a woman's edge.This film was witty, fun, and full of action that any woman will appreciate. For once, women are the ones doing the rescuing!Barrymore is uproarious, Liu is devilishy commanding, and Diaz is silly.Don't expect a serious film, and you won't be disappointed. I loved the slow-motion hair-tossing scenes. It has to be the funnest movie I have seen since American Pie, or There's Something About Mary.This is a great film for girls of all ages--- and guys like it too, because of the action!"
3,Quite Angelic,"With all of the hype of the release of ""Charlie's Angels"", I had quite high expectations for this and I had to admit, I was quite dissapointed. The cast was great and talented (you could easily tell that they bonded off-screen from the way they worked together on-screen) and the stunts and the action was great but the script was quite dissapointing. Its still worth seeing though, because I wouldn't be surprised if this movie became a classic. It has its ups and downs. You can expect to laugh a few times and feel your heart beat faster with the action but there were a few things missing to this movie."
5,Don't pass this over--it's pure fun!,"What a fun movie!This pretends to be nothing more than what it is, a summer escapist film. Fighting, humor, innuendo, gadgets, and plenty of cleavage--it has it all!Cameron Diaz is a joy as the childlike Natalie, while Lucy Liu's Alex is all knuckles and know-how. Drew Barrymore is Drew through and through--sexy, streetwise, and sweet. Bill Murray is wasted, however, as Bosley; his character is all fatherly advice, costume changes, and pratfalls.With high-kicking Hong Kong style action and great visuals, if you are looking for a fun flick to pass a Saturday night, don't pass over this one. It's a best bet."
5,Angels KICK(S) (...),"It's great to see one woman in a movie kicking bad guy(s). It's even better to see THREE of them kicking it! HARD! Cameron, Lucy, and (my favorite!) Drew are all awesome as the karate chopping Angels. I'm not even getting into the plot that much...it's what you'd expect...the Angels are hired to save the day. There's an unexpected plot twist. Bill Murray is great, especially as a sumo wrestler fighting Tim Curry! Every scene is gorgeous and will stand out in your mind, hats off to the director, art director, etc. The extras include footage of the stars training in martial arts and cut scenes."
3,Cute,"I really like the lead actresses in this film. They're cute and fun. This wasn't the typical sleazy, foul film that Hollywood loves to put out so much these days. The film itself is corny and the special effects are sometimes silly. The plot is dumb. But I was never bored watching it. Its a lot of fun."
3,A Good Mix of Comedy and Action,"What more could you want from a movie? In Charlie's Angels you get everything you could wish for. The plot is thin and the lines are cheesey. But I just went with the flow and came out of the theatre with a smile on my face. Paying tribute to the Matrix, many slow motion shots were used during the numerous action scense. These did get a little old but they were interesting to watch. Just like we could all watch Neo from the Matrix dodging bullets, we can now watch Cameron Diaz flying through the air kicking bad guys to death. One of the most looked over things in this movie to me was Bill Murray. His part is very small but every scene he was in you had to laugh. It was also nice to see Tim Curry again, a very underated actor that hasn't been in much lately. All in all, I was happy with this tribute to the original Charlie's Angels. And any die hard fan should pay to seven bucks and enjoy."
1,Juvenile adaptation of the hit TV series,"Lacking completely in plot, characterisation and plausibility, this formula espionage picture, aimed at a pre-pubescent teen market, is the ""reductio ad absurdum"" of the millennial cult of Girl Power. The story, predictably enough, is a fifth-rate James Bond rip-off involving an evil mastermind with a plan to dominate the world and the fiesty girl-agents who thwart his designs. The film contains about as much humanity as a video game, and is derivative from almost the entire gamut of recent blockbusters, such as ""The Matrix"", in terms of both visuals as well as theme. Even the supposedly self-parodying and spoofy jokes backfire thanks to a bad script."
1,NOBODY'S ANGELS....,"Diaz, BArrymore and Liu managed to achieve the impossible: they lended no credibitily to the renowed TV Show original characters !! Their performance was so boring, lifeless, commercial, that after this nothing more could be saved from this movie. A total waste of time."
1,A Real Mess,"As a screenwriter, I find a story to be the most important part of a film. Without it, a film fails, at least in terms of quality. Charlie's Angels is one of those films, that has everything imaginable, but a story.Charlie's Angels features three beautiful, intelligent, and charismatic women. Respectively, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu fail at these qualities. While half of what fills the screen is interesting in a music-video kind-of way, the other half made me scream, ""What is this?!""I also had some other questions. Why does Sam Rockwell sing and dance? What's the deal with the impromptu race car chase? Why is Tom Green in this movie? And, if this is a comedy, why isn't it funny?Overall, Charlie's Angels is a mess and a bad movie, and not even bad in a good way. It makes me roll my eyes everytime I think that this movie made over $100 Million dollars at the box office, and I sigh in disappointment, ""Have audiences really come down to this level?"""
4,Good Movie,"Having been a Charlie's Angels fan from years ago, I do miss seeing Farrah from then, but, Drew, Lucy and Cameron are a very good update from the original. They are awesome in both features. You need to see it if you like the original Charlie's Angels tv show."
4,A HEAVENLY SPOOF...,"This is a funny, well executed spoof of the popular nineteen seventies series of the same name. At times, it is positively hilarious. Cameron Diaz showcases her comedic talents and is a standout. With that luminescent smile and perfect comedic timing, she is reminiscent of a young Goldie Hawn. The ever lovely and voluptuous bad girl, Drew Barrymore, is also very funny, as is the petite Lucy Liu. The droll Bill Murray as Bosley is likewise perfect, and with the addition of John Forsythe, who played the original, mysterious Charlie in the series, reprising his original voice over role, the casting is flawless.While the plot is, as it is with all spoofs, silly, it is, nonetheless, action packed and highly entertaining. Our trio of crime fighting beauties are a sight for sore eyes. The tongue in cheek action scenes, as well as the sheer campiness of the film, keep the viewer engaged. For sheer enjoyment, watch this fast-paced film. You will not be disappointed."
4,It's nice movie!!!,This movie is nice. It's fun and interesting. those 3 characters are best fit on this movie. I was laughing a lot. I like this movie. This movie is not boring. This movie was starting good.
3,see it,this is very good entertainment. iits one of those movies that is just slot of fun to watch. u get the sense that the gurls really had a ball doin this movie and that bleeds over into the veiwer. so if u want a fun flick
2,hot babes but not a hot movie,"it sparks only of teh sexual tension you get to see between the 3 leads and their prancing and their grinding of their bodys when they kick ass. but the story is way to slow and long, it seemed. Bill Murray is the standout here as Bosley. for fans of any of the actors. Sam Rockewell as the badguy is fun also. basically its worth while to see Diaz shaking her ass in those undies"
4,Fun and Fluffy!,"Never has fighting crime looked so sexy! The old TV show gets an amped up big screen treatment, and the three leads are every bit as sexy and fun as the original 70s trio. The plot is straight out of the 70s too!The super-bit edition of the DVD omits the commentary by McG. Odd that they do that!It's good-natured fun and not much more. If you like action and comedy blended with physics defying martial arts you are in the right place."
3,"Chick Flick With Too Much Hype, Not Enough Bite!","First of all I think C.A. is a start of something great. Finally us chicks get a movie where the women aren't whining and instead kicking butt! The actresses were good and C.A. is interesting to watch, but painfully overrated like many Hollywood films. I found the special effects cheap and at times boring. The best parts were when the girls got a chance to do the actual fight scenes themselves instead of just flipping in the air at 90mph. The plot was something you hardly noticed which is not good for a film. The film needed more Lucy Liu and less Drew Barrymore to really pull it over the top. Yep, it's a heck of a movie on a Saturday afternoon, but people who like more brains with their brawn will find this a bit...disappointing."
4,Cameron is so so so funny,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though I didn't actually intend on seeing it. The movie I wanted to see was sold out. I laughed through at least 3/4 of the movie. Cameron Diaz is a riot in her superman underwear. I highly recommend watching at least once. I'm glad I did!! I can't wait to buy it on DVD so I can watch over and over. The soundtrack was perfect also.
1,One star is too many!,"Talk about a bad movie! Not only was the dialog terrible, not only was the acting terrible, but they stole the FX from The Matrix! Special visual effects like that work on a film like the Matrix but not on every action film. These girls are supposed to be in ""the real world"" and yet they are doing unbelievable stunts and fight scenes, rivaling MI1 & MI2 (another couple of bad ones). I can't blame only them alone though, it seems that all of the action films nowadays are trying to see how far they can out do Bond. Now I hear that Angels 2 is going 1 further by changing the ethnic background of Bosley. I guess the films of today don't have to follow continuity, just whatever works at the time."
4,fun gift,"This was a gift for my significant other. I never watched it. She likes it, so that's all that matters! Can't really give details."
2,The Dumbing Down of Girls Gone Wild.,"This film if anything else comes off as pretentious and overdone. You end up not caring if any of the ""angels"" live or die. ""Charlie's Angels"" is yet another in a long list of action films where the viewer actually ends up rooting for the bad guys. With as much empahsis as they put on style in this film, it may as well been a music video. On a superficial level, this film works great, but the cutesey girls kick butt stuff was overempasisized and was not enough to carry the weight of this horrible film."
1,UH NO,"Unrealistic, lack of realism, do not rent or buy, waste of money, worst movie I have seen in a long time"
3,Blu-ray review,"I'm not going to review the movie as there are plenty of reviews of the movie already. This is more so a review on the Blu-ray itself. I must say that when the movie started I was greatly disappointed at the image. It lacked any real crispness that newer film transfers have. The image looked OK not great. The colors looked off from time to time. Some of the skin tones looked orange at times. The sound lacked any real ""punch"". The bonus features seem to be carry over from the Standard DVD version. All in all this movie was NOT remastered for Blu-ray. That's why I'm only giving it 3 stars. Thanks goodness I got it for cheap."
4,High-kickin' good time!,"The TV show was a bit before my time, so I really have no frame of reference, but this movie was a lot of fun to watch! The girls are a great team with their different personalities and expertises. The special effects are awesome (especially the alley fight scene) and the bonus features were cool to show the effects broke down. The plot kept me interested and didn't drag out and become ridiculous like some tend to do. The cast was great, the girls and Bill Murray especially. I could watch it again and again!"
5,a great spoof,this is a well done film. it pokes fun at itself and does it in style. and no movie can beat drew barrymore licking the steering wheel!
5,A must have!,"This movie is cheesy, at least that is what everyone says, but it is supposed to be! I mean, slow motion hair flips!?!? You can't take that seriously, nor should you. If you enjoy action and comedy this is a terrific movie to see. Just be prepared not to take it too seriously."
2,Labeled a Comedy!?,"I was greatly dissapointed in this movie. It identifies itself early on of being a parody of sorts and the self-realization of the Charlie's Angels TV camp....but then doesnt execute it enough as other movies such as ""The Brady Bunch"" have done beautifully. The script is pretty bad, but does follow the same pattern of a typical Angels TV episode. There are a few chuckles, but overall the dialogue ""jokes"" are tired and predictable. The Cameron Soul Train scene is overated and lame. I was suprised how well Lucy Lui is in this film and it was nice seeing Crispin ""George McFly"" Glover. However, everytime I wanted to just turn the movie off, I couldnt frankly because of the pure eye candy sex appeal that is the only thing carrying this film. Overall, its a fun stupid watch, but there's nothing rewarding or memorable"
4,Surprisingly good!!!,"I couldn't believe it i thought i was absolutly going to hate this movie but it was surprisingly sooooo- good.... after tossing and turning through MI2 with those stupid overexagerated slo-mo bs i expected the same here but the efx were done correctly just enough to entertain me, fantastic. i liked the way the original angels music was modernized and used but to keep this short i actually bought this and will watch it several more times!!!! excellent job and the babes are hot as well:)"
2,not my type of coffee,"Unless you are teenager (13-17), you will likely be disappointed, especially, if you like movies of the James Bond type. Charlie's Angels features three wonderfully shaped girls, but their performance (apart from martial scenes) leaves a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, a very poor plot complements this mediocrity. If you ask me, it's not worth spending money for, although your teenager may as well enjoy it!"
3,pretty cute,this movie is really cute if you like charlie's angels! but it is kinda a nothing movie too. i like it alot but not everyone will.
3,Fun!,"Charlie's Angels (PG-13)- Some people are Barrymore lovers, some Diaz lovers and some Liu lovers. I personally am a Barrymore lover. But no matter which of these vixens catches your eye, you'll be rewarded in Spades. While the plot was fun, the dialogue was dead, and the film was a little too 007 for an adaptation of Charlie's Angels the TV show, but one thing is for sure, these girls kick some serious tale! And they take it too!!! They get kicked in the face, and chest like any male action star and they take it!!! These are some women to love!! A guilty pleasure this movie may be but at least the film take the action movie stereotype of what a woman is and gives her some substance to go along with the beauty."
3,Both exciting and annoying,"The Angels are transformed into super-heroes. Why not? The action is so fast and fun that I didn't mind the complete absence of logic in the plot. Diaz and Liu pulled off their stunts with great aplomb, but Drew Barrymore just doesn't look athletic enough to accomplish those moves. I enjoyed the leaping and flipping, but hated the slow-motion and freeze-frame effects. Ditto, the relentlessly agressive soundtrack. McG directs music videos, right? The music was frequently successful at establishing just the right kind of loopy energy that fuels this film, but just as often it was intrusive and annoying. A little restraint would have been appreciated. But I guess a movie like this is not about restraint."
2,How could you mess this up?,"70's camp should be good for humour at least but the directors ended up with a bad farce. Apart from the occasionally succesful cultural references to Evel Knievel and Iron On T-Shirts - the directors got everything else wrong. Its unbelievable that they could take so many delicious pieces (need i say more) and bake such a flat cake. Surprisingly the only successful parts of the movie were the action scenes with the same kind of ""wire-fu"" seen in the matrix. If they had lightened up on the uh...comedy and made it more of an action movie it could have really been good..oh well."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"Horrible, mindless flick. Might give it 2 stars if they were naked. Just my humble opinion."
1,"No acting, no plot, and NOT entertaining.","Our country has been so obsessed with sex and the fact that sex sells, that someone came up with the idea ""oh I know what will be great, we can put three talentless actresses that are good looking in a movie that will be based on an abomination of a show so we can make alot of money fast."" I'm sorry but I'm above all that. This is just another trendy flick that teenage girls and boys will go see. If they had a mind of there own instead of doing what MTV and pop-culture tells them to do, we wouldn't have this crap in the cinema. I can't believe I got bored enough to watch this, well can't call it a movie, I'll just call it a thing."
2,Charlies Angels Is ...,"Not the best movie. It was disgusting how some of the unnecisary content was placed in this movie. The plot was alright, it wasn't as predictable as it could be but still I think most of the people knew there was going to be a ""twist"". I gave this movie 2 stars for 2 reasons.1- Acting was well done.2- The music was good.I dont reccomend this movie for certain people. It wasn't too my liking but I might still buy it - because it was colorful and fun. It really depensd on what type of person you are to determine wether you'll like this movie or not."
3,Entertaining but nothing amazing about it,"This movie was amusing. The plot itself was lacking. Then again, I never saw the original Charlies Angels series so I cannot compare. Maybe this movie was really a tribute to that series, I don't know. But I was expecting a real ""girl power"" flick. Yes, these angels may have the physical power but are lacking in the intelligence department."
3,A creative Difference....,"We are all familiar with the TV series.... The movie is better than the show. It has a believable plot and all the girls seem to work well together, instead of just jiggle (Though it is here). There is a lot of action in this movie. The girls look like they had fun in this movie, especially Cameron Diaz. The Martial Arts fights are campy, but done in the Chinese tradition of high flying. If you sit down to watch the film and take it as the fun that was intended, you'll love"
3,Charlies Angels,I was disappointed in this film as it was bit of a mickey take instead of the sincerity of the series. The hair flicking was overly put on and why do recent films have to use matrix fighting. I also found it difficult to see Drew Barrymore in this role having grown up with seeing her as a child actor but she proved she had other talents.If you want a film that doesn`t take much brainpower then sit back and relax and have fun.
4,BABs,"Bad A-- Babes. Watch sexy and strong Bond-type women beat the pulp out of several men (and women), absent the Bond-type chauvinism. These women are powerful, and gasp-not victims. The role of Bill Murray is odd, (as is he forever odd) and mildly amusing. Several villains threaten to subvert these beauties . . . starring Cameron Diaz, Luci Liu, and Drew Barrymore. A light film, sending no deep and profound message except for maybe that women can be strong and sexy simultaneously."
4,Fun and action-packed!,"For the old-fogies, ""Charlie's Angels"" 2000 may be a rip-off the 1970's hit series. But for me, it was a girl-powered a**-kicking manifesto! I loved Cameron Diaz as Natalie. I love it so much that my girlfriends and I have our own ""Angels""."
3,A MATRIX ACTION STYLE MOVIE,"The action in this movie is really cool,the acting was really great i liked cameron diaz alot in this movie she`s so funny . A combination of action/comedy style ."
1,UK BUYERS BEWARE,"This DVD will not play on non-original R1 players. There are no titles, just a splash screen telling you that this DVD will not play on a modified R1 player. This is the first DVD I've had problems with. Still, I enjoyed the film at the cinema."
1,And they're going to make a sequel...,"CARLIE'S ANGELS, the movie, is junk. WHen I hear tha Drew BArrymore was behind it, I knew it would be a bomb. At least, they had the decency of changing the characters names, because this movie has absolutely NOTHING in common with the TV series, except the names ""Charlie"" and ""Bosley""!!YOu may say that they ""updated"" the scenario for our time. THat's not true. THey simply used the title and concept and changed EVERYTHING, to make this a kind of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE with women. Of course the director chosen was a video-clip director, to make sure the movie hides the total lack of plot, and tries to survive only in the action sequences.I watched it. I did not like it. Barrymore, even with tons of make-up, is not a beautiful or charismatic woman. Only Cameron Diaz saves herself here.And they're gonna shoot a sequel... sad..."
1,Hollywod Fluff,I don't like this movie because these girls are to beautiful to be action hero. Cameron Diaz's legs are too long. It's not a serious movie. It was rather boring and I couldn't get emotionally involved with the plot or the characters.
1,Just Say Flop,"Utter surprise is what I felt when I viewed this film. The storyline is best described as comicstrip meets slap stick. If you do not like slap stick comedy, this is not the movie for you. The photography is beautiful, the stunts are entertaining but everything else is a bust."
1,WARNING: This movie may make you hurl!,"The movie may also cause you to question what planet the characters are living in with all the exaggerated gravity defying fight scenes. This is absolutely, positively the WORST MOVIE EVER. Dodge this movie like your life depended on it. Word to the wise"
1,Just awful.,This ranks with the worst movies I've ever seen. I could only stand to watch it for about 10 minutes before having to turn it off - it is that repulsive. The sad part is somebody spent a lot of cash making this turkey. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else.
3,ACTION FLUFF,"With all the bad press during the shooting of this big screen adaptation of the popular hair-tossing, 70s jiggle TV show, one might surmise that it's dud. Not so.Whatever the driving force (could it be the versatile, intuitive co-producer and co-star Drew Barrymore?) behind this rousing, hard-action comedy, the results are far superior to most other attempts at turning popular TV-series-into-movies (didja see ""Mod Squad""?).This terrific DVD diversion is packed with hours of entertaining extras. Recommended. Action fluff."
3,No sequel please!,"You will love this movie if: 1. You were a major fan of the TV show. 2. You love stop-action fight sequences. 3. You are a fan of Diaz, Liu, or Barrymore.Otherwise, this movie is only average. Good for a rent. Somewhat entertaining."
3,This ain't no godsend!,"Like most people, I can hardly stand still when I hear that a book,television show, old movie or others are being made or remade into a good ol' blockbuster! But once again, I am highly dissapointed. These films are nothing but a good cast, a monster budget and a helluva lot of hype. I do admit, it's fun to watch, some crazy eye-candy, but why is this flick any better than, dare I say it, The Avengers? At times, I was even hoping it would end... Now The Grinch, that was a fun time at the movies, all in all, it wasn't a great film, but it delivered what it promised. And maybe I just didn't get the whole Charlie's Angel thing. Maybe I couldn't connect. Or maybe I just have taste in movies.PS: I know, I know. Maybe it's not right to say I have better taste in movies, especially after saying I enjoyed the Grinch... but hey... all I'm doing is giving my opinion! :)"
1,BAD BAD BAD MOVIE,"I am a huge action movie fan and I have to say with out adout this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is horrible,the diolog if thats what you want to call it is so bad it makes me wanna... Idont know its just bad. The acting is god afall as well. You can tell the director did music videos first cause like music videos it has no substence or direction just style.The kung fu is so horrible in this movie you can tell they are on strigs. Not even T and A can save this movie. I was in pain watching this movie dont buy it."
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!,"Holy s***! How could so many people like this movie. This had the most idiotic plot and they couldn't have been cast more terribly. No offense to them, but the angels are supposed to be gorgous. Cameron can be gorgeous, but she didn't look it, and Drew's pretty, but Lucy Lui, sorry hon, you're very cute, but not gorgous. And did Cameron's acting ability just fly out the window. You'd think that she wasn't a real actress watching this. Sorry ladies, but this movie was just s***. Stick to the original Charlies Angels, its 100 times better than this."
1,You must see it to believe it,This is not only a bad movie but a stupid one tooI don't know if it's comedy or if it's actionmaybe both or maybe the biggest joke of all timeGirls falling down from a 120 feets buildings without a scratchor even a bad hairNon-Stop Silly Action whithout SenseCrispin Glover as a Villain is pretty [sad]and Bill Murray is wasted on this movie.What do you have when you combineJean Claude Van Damme movies style with Jhon Whoo Directionand Beverly Hill 90210 environment where you just asumming that everyone has to act like [people]?Oh I knowCharlys Angels
1,Next time hire a real director to make your movie.,"Wow what a waste,when I heard that the only experience the director of this film had was making music videos I was not expecting much and that is what I got.I believe the intention in making this film were true but you need more than style and FX to make a good movie.If this movie would of been directed by a visionary lets say...Russ Meyer or even a more plausible choice John Woo this movie might of been then end all be all action film. But what do we get here is another ""cookie cutter"" Hollywood film that is going to be dated in 2 months.Wow just what we need."
4,"Fast, Smart, Slick, Fun, Tour-de-Force!","I bought this DVD just because I think Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are gorgeous, but I got more than I bargained for. There is no depth to the plot, but there's plenty of action, and lots of fun. The special effects are great, and the best part of the film, is that it never takes itself seriously. Bill Murray is great as Bosley. I thought that was a curious choice, but he makes it work here, surprisingly well. If you're looking to be flat-out entertained, buy this DVD. You'll probably watch it more than once, I know I will, Cameron Diaz never looked better!"
4,this movie was OK,ok this movie was kinda good kinda bad first of all it was sooooo funny i mean i thought it was gonna be another 1 of those stupied action movies BUT i laughed the whole time u should get it u will NOT be sorry!
4,does what it should,"This is a good little brush. my hand gets warm when using it, but not hot enough to burn. Brissles seem to be holding up just fine after a dozen uses."
2,"Great album, not-so-great CD","I agree with Rodney - The Sound of Christmas is a wonderful album. My objection is with this CD itself. Most of the tracks are acceptably captured on this CD, however Ave Maria (track 09) and the subsequent medley (track 10) are garbled; my guess is one of the 1960's-era master tapes from which this CD was generated has some degredation - these were originally tracks 01 and 02 on side B of the vinyl which would've presented at the start of a new master tape, so someone probably carelessly stored-or-mishandled the outer-edge of the master in the years since - oh well."
4,Very nice,I was a little disappointed when I got this set and one cork was missing. I like the bottles and they hold my home made cordials very well.
3,Informative and Moving,Michael Goodwin tells us of the wartime fate of the father he never knew while at the same time providing us with a uniquely personal insight into the price paid by the victims of war crimes and their families. Especially worthwhile reading if you've been limiting yourself only to a birds eye view military history for a while and need a reminder of the ugly and tragic underside of war that rarely makes its way into works of a much wider scope. Also serves as a painful reminder of the double standard we applied to Japanese war criminals after the war in deference to politics over justice. A good job all around.
4,Shobun,"For a first time author, Michael Goodwin got it right. His in depth look at the father he never knew and those that flew with him gets you hooked in a personal way from the get go. His transition from before the war to the time the crew is captured is seamless and thoughtful. His story speaks volumes of how many of our american airmen were mistreated and brutaly executed. I admire Michael Goodwin for taking a big step in writing a story that may not be popular reading for most and making it thought provoking. Great Read!!!"
3,Japanese Hospitality Circa 1944,"This book tells the story of a US Navy PBY crew that was shot down on a combat mission in the south pacific during World War II, how they were betrayed by the indigenous population to the enemy, and the fate that befell them by the cruel and remorseless Japanese military."
4,Great service,"No problem with delivery. . . I chose surface delivery which took a little longer than expected, but these folks had it priced to cover shipping and even that price was competitive with others who would charge more and charge for shipping on top of that. Product itself is standard Chinese knock-off of GI ripstop waterproof poncho in German flectarn pattern. . . not as sturdy as the old GI types,but more than serviceable. I plan to get at least two more.This outfit wants our business. . . they also included a 5% discount coupon with the order. Not much, but still better than a poke in the eye. I will keep an lookout on their website. Hope they offer more military surplus."
4,This Psychedelic Pop is groovy man,This is a real good selection of Psychedelic songs from the sixties. The songs are the original recordings which is first and foremost when I buy CD's and the sound quality is good as well. The only criticism I have of this CD (and it's minor) is that there are only 12 songs on this CD with an 80 minute capacity. They could have put 7 or 8 more songs on here easily and I wish they did because these songs are great! Still I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking to buy this type of music and want to listen to some far-out groovy music!
5,new tricks comment,"The British series 'New Tricks', unlike most American Detective series, devotes as much time to the interaction of the main characters as it does to the actual solving of the crime. The casting is excellant and the stories are varied and interesting with a touch of humor. Much as I loved 'Inspector Morse' and 'Touch of Frost', I have to say I find 'New Tricks' my favorite. I highly recommend this outstanding series."
5,KEEP THE TRICKS UP,THESE ARE A GREAT GROUP OF ACTORS. THE CREATOR OF TRICKS MUST BE COMMENDED FOR THE IDEA. SEASON 8 IS AS GOOD AS ALL THE REST AND KEEP ME WANTING MORE
1,Had to return it,"I love New Tricks and have 7 seasons. I watch them on TV when they are one. All the actors and actress are fantastic.I gave season 8 a bad review because I received the 3 disk season with Disk 1,Disk 1 and Disk 3. Disk 2is missing. It is returned."
4,"Warm, amusing and thoroughly British",No violence - just good drama and excellent dialogue. Good mysteries for the team to unravel - each set in an interesting place. Good interaction between the characters. Fast-paced and fun.The entire series (from Season 1) is a must-view among all my friends.
4,enjoyable,"New Tricks season 8 is another great season. The characters were thoroughly enjoyable this season, as always. Great ensemble cast."
5,this is a fantastic show,I love this show so I was willing to pay the extra fee even though I feel it should have come free with amazon prime
2,Eh..,"Nice shoe, seems like good construction, but the thong part that goes across the top of my foot was really uncomfortable. It isn't made of a very forgiving material, so after a few hours of wear (especially getting them wet) was really digging into my tops of my feet, causing blisters/skin to wear off. And yes, I ordered the right size. Might be a better fit if you don't have big/wide feet?"
2,Nice but they broke within 3 months,"I purchased these sandals as they looked comfortable and were a good price. When I received the sandals I wore them pretty much every day I could. They were uncomfortable at first (as are all new shoes) but after a while they were great. That was until one day when I was leaning forward to pick something up and the toe divider snapped off the sandal. I felt pretty ripped off, especially from Columbia."
3,It's Deja Vu All Over Again,"Of Queen Caroline, Jane Austen said: ""She was bad, but she would not have become as bad as she was if he had not been infinitely worse."" Caroline of Brunswick is a fascinating person--part Fergie, part the injured Diana, Princess of Wales. The ""he"" in this case is George IV, the five times great uncle of the current Prince of Wales, whose petulant anger over his wife's greater popularity is so reminiscent of our century's War of the Waleses. Indeed, it is the similarities between the two that makes this book a worthwhile read. Still, this book is a weighty, scholarly tome. The author doesn't completely drown the drama but there are times (when she uses the stilted court English of the era) she comes perilously close to doing so. This material in the hands of a storyteller instead of a scholar could have been a best seller."
2,An ambitious biography which fails on several levels.,"Fraser has written an old-fashioned biography which merely traces the events of Caroline's life rather than place her in the context of her time. The exhaustive detail - often seemingly put in at random - may discourage the popular reader. Moreover, despite her extensive use of archival sources, numerous errors, misquotes, and incorrect and misleading citations from printed sources make this a highly problematic source for professional historians."
3,"Book OK, audio version annoying","I don't have the scholarly background to assess the accuracy of Fraser's work in this book. I've found it to be fairly interesting though not incredibly scintillating. What I do feel strongly about, however, is the reader on the audiobook version.The woman reading insists on affecting different accents and tones of voice whenever there is a quote from primary sources (e.g., a faint German accent for Caroline's quotes, French accent for quotes from French commentators, blustery tones for George III and IV, etc.). I'll admit this has some usefulness, as it does help the listener keep track of who is being quoted in this long book, which does rely heavily on primary source quotes. However, it gets on my nerves to hear a reader of a nonfiction work affecting different voices--it's all right for fiction, but it seems silly to me in a work of nonfiction. Just my personal opinion and a warning for those who feel the same way."
1,They can research -but- the Frasers can't write!,"Both Fraser Mother & Fraser daughter can research a subject to death. However, neither writes gracefully or entertainingly. This book reads like a compilation of notes. Yawn. I'd rather read a loosey goosey Mitford biography, as if I wanted sleep, I'd read dissertations."
3,OK for non-Yukon River,"Book is good for information on paddle trips in the Yukon Territory. However, for trips that are on the Yukon River and Tributaries, I found Dan Maclean's book, Paddling the Yukon River and Tributaries much more useful for planning next summer's trip."
4,Guitar for Elementary Student ROCKS!,"A very reasonably priced started guitar, my granddaughter is 8 and loved this Christmas present. She was able to hold it easily, the sound is quite clear and she was playing simple chords immediately.The only difficult part was changing the first string that broke rather quickly-- it took two adults with masters degrees quite a while to get the string restrung. Instructions would have been a big help.I recommend this guitar for a child's starter guitar.Fun Fun Fun!"
2,**False Advertising**,"Although Paul Williams' picture (the dude in the middle) is on the cover of this CD, his voice is not! I can only hear Paul's voice on ""Just My Imagination"" (which is BY FAR the best song on here), and that's it! Eddie Kendricks' rendition of ""Gonna Keep On Trying..."" is excellent, but other than that, this CD is played out. The psychedelic sound was never meant for a group of this caliber, and it really shows here. I can now see why Eddie wanted out of the group after this album. I mean, a 12 minute song, come on! Norman Whitfield was going insane! Save your money, or buy an early Temps CD because this one is not worth the price their asking for. A totally disappointing CD."
1,For the kids,"I don't see how adults could appreciate this movie-- the humor works only on an infantile level. If I'd never seen ""clay-mation"" before, I guess I could appreciate this on a technical level, but it really doesn't look very good.The worst part of this movie is the the movie itself-- any of us could've written this ourselves, there is nothing surprising clever or creative like one would find in a Disney movie (not that I love Disney cartoons, but this pales in comparison.) I suppose Mel Gibson and the other vocalists were pretty good, but overall they are nothing really special.This movie was recommended to me by 2 adults (""It's so funny"") but to me, there is nothing funny in this that an adult can enjoy. If you're looking for a movie for the kids- there are much better ones out there. If you're looking for one for yourself, don't bother!! Lots of yawns, not a single laugh or smile."
2,movies that take place in one small area usualy stink.,"this movie is all aout chickens living in a pen and awaiting execution.like there was some sicko animater who didnt want to get the facts to do a movie on world war 2 so he used imagery and symbolism instead.the entire movie is in a chicken pen.thats not very exiting.the kids watch it like they watch animals at the zoo.theyre cool for a few minutes then thats it.its done in claymation.a lot of people cant even stand to look at that stuff.anyhow,a stunt performer crashlands in the pen and instills the chickens full of false hope.they begin to belive he can really get them out before execution day.he doent know squat though.will kids like a ,movie all about death?i doubt it.i guess the upfront message is all about vegetarianism and the subtle animal farm rip off message is all about ww2.all in all this movie SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Chicken Run is the Next Generation,"Nick Park has done it again. One Chickens head gets cut off. Besides that, this movie is Outstanding."
4,"here chickens, chickens","a cute movie about a chicken who wants to escape a chicken farm with her fellow chickens. her attempts help her meet a handsom rooster. he helps her friends realize just want they are really worth. the movie is slow paced, but there is enough to keep you watching till the end to see what happens. a recommendation for children over the age of 5 only because it suggests a chicken getting killed and eaten."
3,It's OK,"It wasnt as good as I expected, but it was still enjoyable. This is one bizarre movie...it's kind of like they took the plot of 101 dalmations and substituted dogs with chickens. It's a dark movie actually, and if I had little kids I might think twice about letting them watch this. Overall it is enjoyable to watch, I just wasnt blown away by it."
5,Plucky Hens,"As a fan of the Wallace and Gromit movies, I was looking forward to seeing this full-length animated feature and I was not disappointed. Using the same sophisticated adult humour meshed with eye catching animation for the kids, the film is a winner. It tells the story of a group of hens trying to escape from a chicken farm where they are all about to be turned into pies. A rooster arrives on the scene making big, but empty promises of helping them to escape, so it's up to the plucky hens to save themselves.There are a lot of tie-ins to other movies that adults will recognize and appreciate the cleverness, but there's enough colourful action and adventure to keep the kids happy, too. The voice actors all do a great job bringing the characters to life.Of course, the animation is superb and very unique and a lot of fun to watch. The film is a real winner!!"
4,"Save the Chickens, Eat Pork","Nick Park has done it again. Straight from the brilliance of the much beloved ""Wallace and Gromit"" series, he's produced one of the finest, funniest movies of this season.In ""Chicken Run"" the brilliance of the story lies in its tenacious, headstrong heroine, Ginger, and her constant futile attempts to achieve her dream: freedom. That is the creative heart of this remarkable film, that through determination and sheer willpower, you can achieve anything!The DVD is well-packed with behind the scenes information as well as a running commentary throughout the film. Watch the making of ""Chicken Run"", and appreciate the painstaking details the filmmakers needed to go through to create this classic.I highly recommend this movie to everyone!"
5,for fans in the usa the menus is in French,First of all the movie is Eng Dub so us fans buy it now that you now is in English. The only problem is that the special features don't work. I click on the features and nothing happens it takes me back to the same place the top menu. anyways great movie and fast delivery
5,Clamation at its best!,"My kids (6, 4 & 2) wanted another chicken movie, but I convinced them to try this one. Result? They absolutely LOVE it. They've even watched the 'making of' info and are fascinated by the entire clamation process."
4,One of my Favorite Animated movies,"I just love good animated movies, and this is one of the best. The kids will like the silly but fun plot, but the creators really did well with all the ""Great Escape"" and other references that will have the adults rolling on the floor. when I saw this in the theater, my wife and I were laughing at things that the kids in audience didn't get and were looking at us like we lost our heads. Buy or rent this one."
2,Awful picture quality -good movie,Picture quality on Amazon for this movie was very bad. Story of the movie was good. Amazon can do better.
2,Way overrated,"I had heard so much about this film last summer that I couldnt' wait to see it on DVD (where I see nearly every film now). Perhaps if my expectations were lower I might have been pleasently surprised, but as it was it was actually rather tedious. It's basically a one-joke movie about the ""Great Escape"" re-written to be a story about chickens. This might have been hilarious as a short film on Saturday Night Live, but it is not worthy of a feature-length film."
2,overrated,"I didn't think Chicken Run was that great. Yes, I'm aware of the big numbers the movie drew on opening weekend at the movie theaters, and I'm aware of its overwhelming popularity, but the movie didn't do a whole lot for me.I think the main problem is that the chickens have an English accent, making it hard to understand them. The film was also very dark and hard to see what was happening (no, it wasn't my television). The claymation is nice, but that's the only thing the movie had going for it."
3,Sorry-Not that good,"Bought the DVD and watched with a 5-year-old and my husband. My husband and I chuckled maybe three times and the 5-year-old maybe once. I agreed with another posting that it was definitely dark and edgy and not appropriate for a child under 8 years old. Although I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't a musical, I found it slow and uncaptivating. The British accents were sometimes difficult to follow (it's not as if you can really read an animation's lips to help you along). I wouldn't consider it a ""keeper"" such as Toy Story or Lion King."
1,SO bad....,I bought this movie for my 2 year old daughter. Since it is rated G and she loves Chickens I thought it would be a win win. It was so bad. The movie coloring is dark and I think the rating should be higher than G. It over all creeped me out. I tossed it out.
1,It ain't Wallace and Gromit.,"This film epitomizes what happens when geniuses sell out to money-mogul-morons. Wallace and Gromit is to Chicken Run what Citizen Kane is to...what was it...Gallo commercials? Anyway, bye, bye, Nick Parks, you were good in your time. Oh wait, my beloved host won't publish this unless I actually discuss the film. Ok, well, Chicken Run lacked all of the sociological depth found in Wallace and Gromit. Rather than a twisted but profound exploration of modern consciousness, it was a banal and predictable yarn tormented by the voice of that...Mel Gibson. Like Jerry Lewis, they love him in France. But that's Como!"
1,Chicken Run,"Directed By:Nick Park& Peter LordDate Release:Friday, June 23,2000Length of Movie:1 hour 25 minutesRating:GIntroductionThis is a movie about a group of chickens that were captured bythe farmer and his wife who were very cruel and tried to turn the chickens into pop chicken pies.A rooster named Rocky(Mel Gibson), who literally fell from the sky and made the hens believed that he could teach them to fly out of there. Rocky was a rooster which ran away from a circus and had beenshot out of a cannon into the yard.OpinionIf you want to know how the chickens got out of the yard, please remember to watch the movie.i think it is a worth watching movie, as it is funny and the chickens are very smart!You must rememberto watch it."
1,horriblely stupid,stupid plot was stupid graphics were lame jokes were extremly corny even for a dreamworks movie
1,Don`t see this movie!!,This movie wasn`t very good. You will just sleep through this really boring movie. If you do want to see Chicken Run Do Not Buy It rent it!! Ignore all the reviews that say it`s so great. They`re over exaggerating. My two year old brother didn`t even notice it was on. My mother didn`t think it was funny.
3,Not as funny as I expected,Chicken Run didn't get funny until the end of the movie. It was very entertaining at the end. I recommend this movie for families because it is enjoyable for everyone.
4,"Great animation, so much fun.","While the chickens on Evil Mrs. Tweddy's (Voiced by Miranda Richardson) farm. The Chickens plan to escape, they failed. Every time, they escape, the situation gets much more worse. The lead chicken Ginger (Voiced by Julia Sawalha) is trying different ways to escape. Ginger saw a Rooster named Rocky (Voiced by Two Time Oscar-Winner:Mel Gibson) flyed. She believes that Rocky could teaches Ginger and the others chickens to fly. Before Mrs. Tweddy is turning the chicken into Hot Chicken Pie.DVD's has an clear anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an Strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound. An running commentary track by filmmakers-Peter Lord & Nick Park. DVD is Packed with Extras. This is One of the Highest Grossing films of 2000. An entertaining comedy fantasy animation is for all ages. An instant comic family classic. Grade:A-."
4,one of the best cartoon movies,Chicken Run is fine for children but much of the humor will only be caught by adults. This is one of my all time favorites.
3,Just average,"The claymation was brilliant, which is worthy of three stars in it's own right, but the plot and dialouge could of been better. Overall, it is a good movie to sit through once, but after that, you'll never want to see it again."
3,"A children's movie....not really for children, or adults.","I am watching this for the first time. It is November 10, 2001 and I am not interested. Perhaps I should have watched this earlier, and should not be comparing it to ""Shrek."" However, We have been watching ""Shrek"" for a week now, and the two Dreamworks pictures are miles apart.The British accents are very distracting for me, and my 8 year old daughter keeps asking me ""What did they say?"" The story is okay, but seems to go nowhere fast.My wife and I found that this movie did not hold our interest or the interest of our two children. I can safely say that we will not be watching this any time soon. This is a very strange movie destined to become a cult movie for fans of animation.Great animation, clever story, but on the whole, a letdown of a movie."
5,Have Not Seen It Yet,"I have not seen this one yet, Christmas came in between, but if it is anything like I suspect it will be, it will probably be watched more than once."
3,review,"Although I didn't receive the item by the promised date of Dec. 24th for the following day, I did receive it and would consider purchasing from them again."
4,Cock-A-Doodle-Do!,"There's very little gone fowl in this delightful tale that has enough legs, breasts and heart to keep old and young audiences interested.Seems Mrs. Tweedy's chickens aren't very interested in becoming the main ingredient of her pot pies and are scheming to fly the coop. So, Gibson comes to the rescue as a wannabe flying rooster, ready to show his feathered friends how to hop the fence to a world where they won't get their throats cut if egg production slows down. Of course, he's a bit of a ... con artist himself with designs on a comely hen. The dialogue is sluggish at points, but it's coming from chickens with British accents--sometimes, that's all you need.A fun animation film worth four clucks for the buck."
3,Not good or Bad.,This is the type of movie in my view which is missable. It is not a classic or an epic but just an ordinary movie. The animation like many have said is outstanding however the plot runs dry half way through the movie. The dvd itself has some special involvements which the normal video would not include and this is actually a very good dvd. Many people have different views and many of you may find this a thrill or worse than i have just stated. I do not try to put you off but just try to advise you with my opinionbut if you like Wallace and Gromit then this is up your street.
3,Mixed reviews,"While we did enjoy the lighter parts of this movie, there were enough grim scenes to make me wonder if there couldn't be another rating besides ""G"" -- maybe a ""GRR"" This isn't, in general, what I would call a delightful movie. It did have its moments but the general atmosphere was dark and edgy. Maybe I'm too old-fashioned to enjoy today's ideas of what makes a good children's movie. My daughter is 9 and there were some parts that she wished she hadn't seen. I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie for very young children, below age 8 and you're likely to be up soothing someone's nightmares for a while."
2,Decent Entertainment,"Another one of those witty, clever and all-ages animation pictures (like ""Toy Story"" or ""AntZ""), ""Chicken Run"" falls a bit short on expectations and doesn`t shine as it could and should. So the plot has multiple viewpoints and its interpretations can compare this to some situations in concentration camps, but for the most part this movie is lackluster. Yes, this animation style is creative and funny, but the story is entirely predictable and the characters aren`t really that memmorable or engaging.There are some interesting and innovative scenes and a couple of hilarious lines enjoyable to both kids and adults, yet this picture could have been more ambitious and surprising. Overall this is worth a few genuine smiles and laughs, but it ends up being not too remarkable. A passable family entertainment, worth watching once."
1,Not for animal lovers,I watched the first 5 minutes before letting the young ones aged 4 and 5 see it. Boy am I glad I did. A chicken is taken away from his friends for not producing enough eggs. He's taken to be slaughtered. You see the farmer and his ax. Then the silhouette of the chicken having his head chopped off. Then the rest of the chickens sad and scared. Needless to say I never showed it to the kids.
2,"The animation is good, but the movie is bad.","I gave Chicken Run 2 stars because of the excellent animation, it was brilliant. Unforunately, the movie's plot was bad and gloomy. I mean, there is a part when a chicken gets her head cut off, and that part is totally uneeded! And about 40% percent of the humor is lame. It is hard to think that such a good anamated movie, has a stinker plot."
1,Chicken Run,"First of all, I gave this movie only 1 star to attarct you because I never read the 5 stars. This movie deserves 100 stars! (I'll keep this short)Usually, I can just look at the preview for a movie and tell if it is going to do well or not. I made a big mistake thinking that Chicken Run was going nowhere. But when I saw this movie, I changed my mind. The storyline has never been used before (obviously), which makes it great.It has great humour, good storyline, and is appropiate for children."
3,misleading,"was marked as new, however, the package didn't look new and had a big blackpiece of tape over it. not sure why. embarrassed as i had to give as a gift.misleading.....thought ""new"" meant just that."
3,A little slow.,"This was mostly for my 6 year old, but I watched with him. I think the story was a little ""slow"", but he made it all the way through."
4,My new happy movie,"Well, I am fourteen years old, and I thought I had outgrown animated movies. I never planned to see Chicken Run. However, when I watched this with a film club at my church, the movie gave me that warm and happy feeling I used to get from watching kid's movies. Even the adults there seemed to love it. The whole plot was easy to understand and good for all ages, although some depressing scenes with an axe might be a little over the top for some younger kids. All in all, I really enjoyed Chicken Run and I will probably own it someday!"
5,The Best of 2000,"""Chicken Run"" is fantastic. The stop motion animation is smooth and fast, and the writer has placed tons of clever British humor into the script. This is a high for Mel Gibson, because he was also in my second best film of 2000, ""The Patriot"""
4,Nick Park does it again,"I thought the artistry was great in this movie, but it's definitely not for youngsters who like claymation. The subject content was pretty morbid, even though the movie ends positively. I was kind of shocked that it was so violently suggestive - it was scary, and I'm an adult. I felt uncomfortable, which is why I don't watch it that often. After seeing this, I am much happier watching his other works like ""Wallace and Gromit"", which is far more suitable for children."
4,Fun Family entertainment,"Great fun, a good family film. Definitely one that can entertain the kids over and over. The modeling/animation is really great (check out the earlier shorts, they're really good too).This is one of those kid/family movies that was written to entertain adults too, although I certainly wouldn't be entertained watching it more than a time or two. Recommended for family viewing right up there with most Disney movies."
5,Funniest Movie Of 2000!,"Chicken Run is a great movie for all ages. It's about a group of chickens that want to escape a fram before they get turned into pot pies. But Whan rocky a cocky american rooster shows up everyone thinks he could fly. He ignores all the problems around him insted of flying on his mind his mind is set on one thing winning the heart of Ginger a young British hen (but she knows Rocky is not to be trusted). Togher It's up to Rocky and Ginger to help their friends fly the coop before it's too late.I recomend this movie to Everyone, Still young kids might get scard in some parts overall it's a outstanding movie.!!"
4,Glorius!,"This recording was made at a series of AGO (American Guild of Organist) conventions. It is absolutely GLORIOUS! Sowerby's uses choir, organ, brass and percussion to create an inpiring setting of several biblical texts. His palette of harmonic colors is bold, beautiful, and sure to hold your ear throughout. This is what church music SHOULD be. If you're tired of all that ""contemporary"" TRIPE that is being shoved down your throat on Sunday mornings....buy this cd and remember the days when we tried to aspire to God's level......instead of bringing Him down to ours!"
4,Late Django at his finest,"A valuable corrective to the conventional wisdom about Reinhardt's post-war playing, which, so far from deteriorating, actually achieved deeper levels of communicative insight. In fact, I think his solo ""Ou est tu, mon amour"" is his finest moment on record; and you can't say fairer than that."
4,Redeemed Souls,"Richard Jeanty tells a powerful story in Neglected Souls, chronicling the lives of Nina and Jimmy who were raised in the slums by their drug addicted, prostituting mother Katrina. Katrina's downward spiral leads her to commit suicide leaving her two teenage children to fend for themselves. Forced with such a harsh reality Nina and Jimmy somehow manage to pull together and pull themselves out of poverty.Readers will root for Nina and Jimmy while they overcome incredible odds to become successful adults. Kudos to Mr. Jeanty for writing an urban novel that depicts what can be achieved through hard work and perseverance."
1,Terrible,"I thought this book was unreadably bad. It was poorly written, and full of spelling and grammatical errors. It didnt seem as though it had been proof read or edited at all. It seemed like something written by a high school student, which would be fine, but not when you are charging people 15 dollars to buy it and presenting it as a completed novel. I think its a sad state of affairs that a book like this is even able to get published."
5,heart wrenching!,"After reading his other books, I became a fan. I had to read this one and I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks!"
5,My Favorite Album,"Okay. I admit I am a huge Maireid Sullivan fan. However, having said that, fans expect that sooner or later the music is going to fade. I usually find that artists I favor have one or two bad cd's in which I wish I'd never spent my money! However, I'm happy to say that I've yet to find ONE bad cd by Maireid Sullivan. I'm so happy that she included ""All About Love"" on this cd as it hs quickly become one of my favorite songs. I've seen her live 3 times and she just gets better each time. This cd only further proves that Maireid has staying power! You won't be wasting your money! Highly recommended."
3,recommended by Harvard Prof,"I ordered but have not yet read this book on the recommendation by John Dunlop, professor at Harvard U, from The Harvard Guide to Influential Books (1986). ""In this work of dispute resolution, as well as in common discourse, interpreting what parties say and what they really mean is of fundamental importance."""
