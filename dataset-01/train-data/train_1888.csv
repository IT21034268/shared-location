2,It was for a younger kid,"When you buu this cart, they never tell you that is for a 5-6 years old kid, so the cart was too small for mine"
2,NOT a Cliqgear for your kid,"I have a Cliqgear 3.0, which is pretty much the best bag cart ... for grownups. I thought, ""Hey, I can get a cart for the kids and they can walk with me as we play - how fun!"" The problem with these little carts (my 11-yr-old has a different brand, but same problem) is that they give you webbing straps with those clicky connectors, and not elastic straps to hold the bag on the cart. Elastic would solve the problem with these carts, which is that the bag falls off the cart! Hardly an ideal situation. I think I can fix the problem myself, but don't expect to use it right out of the box."
5,"Great movie, great music!","I had seen this movie on TV about 3 months back, and thought this would be a good movie to buy. I gave it 5 stars only because of the movie and music, but I wasn't too horribly impressed with the platypult kit that comes with it, great film, great music. This I think isn't JUST a kids movie, it's a movie anyone can enjoy."
5,Phineas and Ferb 3-Disc Special Edition DVD,"This movie is one the but the 3 disc special edition is another. I bought my copy the day it came out for 14.99 specifically at Toys R Us. The packaging is great since it comes with a slipcover, blue case, platypult kilt, 150 DMR points, the digital copy, 8 bonus tracks, and the bonus disc. The special features on the DVD are cool and the feature that lets you change main menu dimensions. You are probably wondering whats on the bonus disc well this is it:-Ask a Foolish Question/Misperceived Monotreme episodes-5 Take Two with Phineas and Ferb interviews:*Jack Black*Taylor Swift*Randy Jackson*Tony Hawk*Andy SambergThe disc with the feature film includes deleted scenes and an episode aswell (Attack of the 50 Foot Sister) w/ optional commentary.You can still get the 3 disc on ToysRUs.com or in store."
5,Good movie for the family and fans of the show,"I have to say I was pleased with the movie. My son loved it, he seriouly sat and watched it like three times in a row. It is a good movie for the family and for fans of Phineas and Ferb."
5,Recent Phineas and Ferb convert,"Got into the series after finding it on Netflix, and the movie is just wonderful. We have watched it several times, and it entertains everyone every time!"
5,Contents of the DVD Set,"Disk One of this two-DVD set includes:the movieall the songs with ""Perry-oke""the movie with ""Perry-oke""8 deleted scenes, including one cut song (""Mysterious Force"")the episode ""Attack of the 50-foot Sister"" (with character commentary from Major Monogram and Heinz Doofenschmertz)several Easter Eggs in the menusDisk Two contains a digital copy of the movie."
5,Such a great film! Worth having on DVD!,"I'm a fan of the television series, and the film was just as good as any other episode! I cannot wait to purchase it on DVD so I can have access to this amazing film any day I want!"
2,Didn't like,Didn't like the DVD. Have others by this artist and really like them. It came quickly. The service of this company was excellent.
5,Excellent natural face cream,"Very simple yet rich, natural carrot base face cream that makes your face glow. Smells nice too."
5,great cream,i am 52 yrs old and have tried every cream possible. i love this cream! i am italian so my skin isnt dry but it does seem to fill wrinkles. it is a bit thick so i use it sparingly and truly found this cream makes my skin look great. it also smells fanastic! i wish they made this in an eye cream. ive been using it for a yr and this is my new face cream. happy face!
2,too thick,"I really like Burt's Bees products. This product would make a better night cream than day cream. It is too heavy and made my face break out (and I rarely ever breakout, because I have dry skin."
1,Too Thick and Feel so greasy,"The cream is way too thick and greasy. I don't feel comfortable after put it on in the morning... , because the thickness of the cream, you need to use a bit more than normal cream which makes it even worse..."
3,Too Heavy for A day creme,"I think this is way too heavy for a day creme. It goes on thick and greesy. It is very heavy. The greesiness subsides but I can still feel the heaviness. I feel like I have a mask on. It is not light like Burts Day Radience which I think is a much better day creme. However this creme seems to be good for really cold winters. If you put it on with some water and really rub it into your skin it seems to lock the moisture in, which is good for cold winter days that have a drying affect on skin. Also I think it's a great night cream. Once again, I rub it into my skin with some water to help my skin retain moisture. So for a cold creme or intensive creme to protect against cold weather I'd give it 5 stars but not as a day creme."
4,"Good moisturizer, but it's a little strange","I like this moisturizer, and it doesn't make my skin breakout. However, it has an orange tint that you can see on your skin. It looks fine on your skin though, maybe like a slight bronzer. However, it can also stain clothing, so be careful with it. It also has a unique smell--perhaps the carrots? It's not a bad smell, but I would characterize it as on the earthy side rather than on the perfumy side."
4,Wonderful Lullaby CD,"I first used this CD with my children over a decade ago. They loved it at bedtime. Now, I purchase it to have for my grandchildren and as gifts for new mothers. Joanie Bartels has a great talent for children's music. Highly recommend all of her CDs."
2,"Pure ""navel contemplation"" music!","Let me go on record as saying that Joe Lovano is one of my favorite sax players. He can swing and negotiate dificult chord changes with the best of them. However, his interests are so diverse and far-reaching that it is always with some anticipation that one does not know what to expect on his next CD. I had an idea what to expect with this CD considering the match up. There is some good tight ensemble playing (intonation is astounding) and a few good solos, most notably the alto clarinet solo taken in ""Tricycle"" by Lovano. However most of the the CD sounds like so much self-indulgent whining."
1,OVER INDULGENT CRAP! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I got caught out. I saw the stellar line up, heard the opening track and thought i was in for some real cutting edge jazz with the saxists battling it out and they do. For a couple of tracks and then that dreaded word 'free' comes in. Basically 'free music' means playing whatever you want, all at the same time, no changes, just making an indescriable noise for thirty minutes and laugh all the way to the bank. This makes 'trout mask replica' sound conservative. It's just a noise and i would expect some sort of acknowledgement to the mugs like me that paid out hard earned cash to buy it. The arrogance of the three men bears belief. All superior players what were they thinking of? That it was listenable? Save your money and look else where if you're expecting excitement. They even turn a classic like Coltrane's 'india' into dross. An insult to jazz."
5,bought a few pairs,"As my son grew out of one pair, I bought the next size up. They did not wear out, and he ran every where in the house with them. I have tile floors and these were the best, because socks just made him slip. These stayed on. Now that my son is to big for these, I buy them for all my friends younger ones."
5,Perfect size for young children,These hand pointers really come in handy in my 1st grade classroom. Students can use them to point when they're explaining their work to their class and I use it as well. I like the colors as well.
1,pointer,I started to order these and found out you can get them for a dollar a piece at the dollar store. I think it's kind of a rip off for what they are.
1,Do Not Buy,"We played two games with this set. Game one: A mallet head split with only the metal band holding it together. Game two: now with only three mallets one of the balls split into two pieces. This was one of the more expensive ""backyard"" sets but obviously has serious defects."
1,Poor craftsmanship,"One handle was bent,One mallet head has hairline crack,13 year old cracked ball on the third game, Good luck PS.Bend handle broke shortly after the ball"
4,funny,"There isn't as many stories as I thought I would find in here, but they are so funny. It isn't just funny things that happen during sex; there's a variety. It had me laughing out loud at how silly some people are. I would buy this used. $9.95 seems like too much for a small book."
1,not received,I have not received the product in the mail still! And it has was suppose to be here a long time ago.
1,boring...not funny,"I found this book boring and not very funny. Most of the stories seem made up, penthouse letters are funnier."
2,More for Administrators,"I'm taking a math teaching methods course and this book was on our recommended reading list. It is fairly short and an easy read. The book makes a few main points:1. Math education is important2. The US is not doing a particularly good job3. Therefore we need to change how we are doing it.However the book does not do much explaining of how we should change our techniques. The how part is what I am most interested in so I was somewhat disappointed. Also the book is fairly old ('89). If your looking for a good book on math education I would read the ""The Teaching Gap"" by Stigler and Hiebert. If you are looking for a book to convince people that math education is important and needs some reform then Everybody Counts might be for you."
3,BEWARE: You will be shipped the stainless steel model!,"Ordered this expecting to receive a black leatherman blast. Why you ask? Because the picture shows the black one and the title clearly states ""BLACK"". Well, I received the stainless steel model and I see I'm not the first person to have this issue. Hey seller! Do yourself and your future customers a favor and change the picture."
2,Wrong Item Advertised Here!,"This listing advertises the black oxide version of the Leatherman Blast with Molle sheath. I ordered and was sent a stainless version with a leather sheath. The Blast is discontinued from Leatherman's 2012 product line and most likely will never be seen again. I was very unhappy to say the least. Now I have to send it back and wait for my card to be credited with a refund. Meanwhile, finding a black oxide version my be harder now than when I placed this order, not to mention the black oxide version is more expensive and that is the price reflected here. You will be charged for a black oxide and sent the stainless/leather version. Minor error? Not to me it wasn't. They are lucky I gave two stars for extremely fast shipping."
3,It's heavy!,"I bought this thinking that I would carry it on my person 24/7, when really the sheath (even though I love it for it's molle capability) is kind of large. That's ok, but it is quite heavy for EDC. I guess that's what you get when you make a durable multitool. I love the black oxide finish. Sure, it comes off just a little bit, but not too much. Wear on a tool looks awesome anyway. Overall, I'm impressed with it's capabilities (minus the scissors, why are they so damn small?), but unimpressed with the weight. I use it quite often, but I would use it more if it was on my person, and that entails a light weight multitool."
3,Too Stiff,"I rated this as just OK because it was not the quality I expected. The action is too stiff (tight). It had a dark oily coating that comes off on your hands. It's just ordinary, nothing special."
3,"The plastic broke, but still the cable works","I've used this cable hardly 15 to 20 times and since you need to plug in the connector to the phone and take it out, after 10 times or so the plastic became loose initially and then the two pieces of plastic came which form the connector, came apart. The cable still works but you gotta be careful now or you might pull apart the wires."
4,"If you're interested in Irish ways, read ""The Missing Match""",A warmly descriptive story of life in rural Ireland. This book was very easy to read and I recommend it highly. I'm looking forward to a sequel!
1,Can't get the order right.,Ordered this item was sent the ears and the teeth. Could not get any response from phone or email about correcting the error. The packing slip was correct but not the item. Very disappointed.
2,book,"Deliver was very fast which is a plus. I had to buy this book to study for a test. It was extremely boring, but I didnt want to read it anyway so that may be why. Easy reading and well written just boring."
1,Yes it's true!,This book sums up the attitude that allot of Americans seem to have today. Live the life of gluttony and ignore what's good for our future.
4,enjoyable and informative,"The beginner just starting out as well as the intermediate angler will find this text a worthy companion. In my opinion, the most important thing to do is locate fish in a body of water. The authors have done this for us. All we have to do is show up and give it a try. WIth the knowledge gained in the book even the novice will catch fish if they put their time on the water. Best of luck! P.S. I live in Pa. now and still fish in Jersey. Don't let anyone fool you. Jersey IS the Garden State!!"
4,"Good Book for Technique, not Entertainment","New to Giant Tuna, I have been searching for books/articles that describe this sport. This is the ONLY book that describes the fishing methods used by top charter boat captains for bluefin tuna fishing. If you are a tuna fisherman, buy this book.If you are simply looking for an etertaining read, do not buy this book. It is poorly written and you may grow tired of the constant PENN, LEES, and ANDE commercials by the author."
5,a real winner,"if you want to learn how to catch,grade and sell a giant bluefin tuna this book is for you, capt. greg beacher does'nt hold back anything, he reveals the secrets that the pros use. this book is filled with pictures and illustrations and he passes on his 20 + years of experience. i highly recommend this book."
5,Layton Court Mystery; Classic Detective Story,"""The Layton Court Mystery"" is the first detective novel by Anthony Berkeley, one of the Golden Age writers. It is delightful! And this edition is quite nice."
3,Debatable,"Sure you got your edge, but for me, a typical 500mg dose was too much, and on a few days upped to as much as 750mg, in short, it's great to have the motivation, the power, but with great power comes responsibility, unless you're good at holding back your spite i wouldn't recommend this. A month of using it, i certainly notice the power-dive afterwards, but the attitude that came with it, just wasn't worth it for me."
5,Excellent Checkbook,"I've had gone through a lot different wallets and I have to say this is the best one, It's great leather material and very rugged. Its good to know great quality comes with a great price."
5,My personal guide,When I read this book I felt like Katie was personally showing me KC. It was like she was holding my hand as we explored the neighborhoods and hot spots.
1,Just buy some Purigen,"Waste of money. My tank water was not too bad to begin with, but I thought I would try this with some carbon for the extra polish, instead of buying moreSeachem Purigen 250ml(which makes water crystal clear). What a waste of money! From day one this has done nothing to clear my water, in fact it made it worse. It makes my AquaClear power filter stink after a few days (it was not clogged), and after 3 weeks of no results I threw out the filter pad and am not looking back. I have way too much of this stuff left, sitting in the cabinet under my tank, collecting dust. If you can't afford or don't like Purigen, polyester pillow stuffing (a.k.a. ""filter floss"") works better than this. Would not recommend."
4,Ch Joystick,"ProsLots of buttonsPliant springsAccurate, smooth inputsConsDesigned for big handsThe throttle, yaw and pitch adjust sliders need more pronounced detents to mark the center/neutral position."
5,CH Products are a good deal and so is the company that stands behind them.,"Don't believe anyone who gave the Fighterstick a low rating.I had my original for 4 years when it developed a problem with the hatswitch.4 YEARS!I read the reviews who claim the newer products don't hold up.I chanced buying a new one after reading the reviews.After having a conversation with a CH employee on their forum, I sent my old one back.It cost me $12.50 in shipping...Out of warranty for 3 years and they sent me a new/refurbished stick for $12.50.Now I have a backup stick so that in another 4 years I won't have to do without while CH sends me a new one :)The stick itself is a bit large for my hands. but it works very well.It is well made and is built to last.So if you want a stick that lasts a long time, but a CH Fighterstick."
2,Surprisingly poor,"Pros:Low resistance allows excellent precisionPlenty of buttonsGood calibration softwareCons:Base is too lightTrim wheels are useless and cause problemsNo rudderNo buttons near the throttleThe stick feels quite good but I wish I had gotten something else. The base tips over because it is very light (and I admit I probably jerk the stick too hard). The trim wheels on the base are not useful and I sometimes accidentally move them off center while I'm using the stick. That is very inconvenient. I was aware that the stick had no rudder when I bought it (I bought it with the CH Pro Pedals) but I didn't realize how complicated the separate rudder would make setting up games and sims. I used to use a Logitech 3D Pro which was a really lousy joystick but it worked perfectly the moment it was plugged in, with minimal setup.CH has a great reputation but this joystick was a mistake for me and I'm going to replace it with something simpler."
2,"Good quality, outdated design","I have no doubt this stick lasts many years, but it has been around for many years, and is now way behind the curve. The separate X/Y axis was the biggest con for me, as it makes diagonal/rotational stick movements rather awkward. CH needs to replace their aging product lineup."
2,Not Impressed,"For the price, stick feels very cheap... buttons have no range of motion butare merely short clicks if moved in any given direction.No software included for macs..... I think this product should have beenno more than 25 bucks.....Will probably return. I'm sure there are sticks out there with better responsivenessand a much more realistic feel......"
1,Program Specialist,"Programming the game controller, the Y-Axis wasn't responding as it pointed out in the huge Programing Manual. Sent it back for refund."
5,Very nice well made stick,"I have had this stick for a month now, and I love it. It was recommended by a friend that has had his for about 4 years now. It is very well made and it feels good, however, you must have big hands because this is a big stick. The trim wheels make a huge differance playing Lockon. Since this doesn't haven't a rudder, I use 2 buttons which works pretty well. The throttle wheel sucks cause it doen't respond right away (it's usable though)"
2,Bird cage,"I was looking for a different style bird cage and I certainly got it with this. The instructions were not the best and it was difficult putting the top cornice and turret on the actual cage. The first turret arrived broken and would not stay together, the replacement arrived and continues to fall off, so it remains off. Unfortunately the pull out tray does not seal enough in the front and feathers, seed shells are always coming out. I would not recommend this particular cage for the above reasons."
2,Beautiful Birdcage but with a problem,"The birdcage is a conversation piece in our home but we encoutered a problem setting it up. The short horrizontal wire to secure the corner turret was missing. A replacement cage was promptly sent but the piece was also missing and the base of the cage was not square, causing the metal drawer to stick out on one side. I was sent a part that was supposed to be the horrizontal wire but with no instructions. My husband ""Rube Goldberged"" the turret in place. I wrote a letter regarding this latest problem but received no response.Hopefully this an isolated occurance with this company.It's a beautiful cage."
1,Broken,This product arrived partly assembled with several of the plastic pieces broken. I contacted the manufacturer and after a month today I finally received the replacement parts which also arrived broken.
3,A Tale of Early Peru,"An early novel of Peru, written in the late 1800's and by a woman, making it an even more unusual work. It's an indictment of the way the newly-independent Peruvian elite replaced the Spanish in a deliberate conspiracy to keep the Indian population in conditions of serfdom. This serfdom included enforced days of slave labor for the town and work as personal servants. A share-cropper system assessed usurious interest rates a s high as 500%. The government officials, the military, the priests were all in on it, so much so, that they attack the home of a liberal couple from the city who try to work on behalf of the Indians. The book is written in a stilted 19th Century style. The plot is soap-opera-ish and husband and wife exchange conversation that reads like a newspaper editorial. The book has value for Latin American scholars, historians, sociologists and political scientists but I don't recommend it for the general reader."
4,A great camera under a different name,"This is indeed a great camera to use, full of features and provides high quality images. If you are having problems finding this model it is also available as the Fuji Finepix 4700 Camera. Fuji designed, and manufactures this camera."
3,Fuzzy Logic.,"Regardless of what the numbers say, this camera is a (roughly) 2.1 megapixel system that uses a process similar to television ""line doubling"" to effect its claimed 4.3 megapixel resolution. While that is true, it also true that the pictures it takes are plenty sharp without ""doctoring"" and will easily enlarge to 5"" x 7"" without becoming grainy. This is in no small part a result of excellent optics. In addition, the true (optical) 3X zoom is excellent, and its ability to shoot rather long movies (80 secs with sound) is a nice plus. Having said all that in its favor, it is still (IMHO) *way* overpriced, mostly because it has the Leica name on it. You can buy the same camera with the Fuji name on it (model 4700) and save hundreds!"
5,The Best of Pride,"This is a great introduction to Pride and the greater world of mixed martial arts. Unlike other knockout compilations, they don't just show knockouts, but good fights as well (a few end in decision or submission). There is also a fluidity to the presentation, unlike the UFC's compilations, which usually only show us a few seconds of the fight."
4,boring review to great fights!,"The fights were great like most pride fights, dvd's came with minimal scratches, and i recieved them within the time frame alotted to me."
3,Old but starting to get entertaining,"Pride 6-11 is where things started to get more entertaining. You can begin to see the progression from the ""tough-man competition"" days of old, into the skilled sport that MMA is today.Kazushi Sakuraba gets better with every fight... Originally just a grappler with great Ju-Jitsu skills, he really matures once he adds effective strikes to his game.As soon as Wanderlei Silva enters Pride, the quality of fighting improves drastically.The obvious drawback of this box set is that it doesn't include Pride 10... Shamrock vs. Fujita, Belfort vs. Matsui, Metzger vs. Silva, and of course the infamous flying Kimura Sakuraba used to snap Renzo Gracie's elbow.At any rate this set has some decent early fights with well known fighters."
3,bushido 4,"bushido 4 features good fighters such as mirko cro cop,takanori gomi rogerio nogueira, kazuhiro nakamura,hyato sakurai,paulo filho and akira shoji.But bushido 4 falls short and only have a few good fights.the other good thing about this dvd is the brazilian top team video in the bonus features.best fights:1)rogerio nogueira vs nakamura 2)mishima vs marcus aurelio 3)gomi vs mello 4)filho vs shoji"
3,Another typical event...,"for the most part this was a boring event. Most of the fights were of the slow paced, cautious variety that saw very few exciting flurries. There were a couple of fights that were entertaining so it is not a total waste of time to see. Overall though, this was an average Pride show at best. If you have a limited budged, save your money for 'Critical Countdown 2004' as that is one of the best events money can buy right now."
3,Wrong color shipped,Great skates thus far but I ordered green and got blue and black instead.My son really wanted green skates for Christmas but is still happy to have them.
5,Charger Splitter,Works great for me. Allows me to charge my phone on the mini usb and my HS850 bluetooth on the other.
5,Wonderful gadget for car or computer charging,This device is great in several situations:1.) when you're in the car and need to charge both devices off a single car charger2.) when you want to charge your headset using your computer's USB port3.) if you have limited space on a surge protector for charger adapters but need to charge the headset and USB simultaneously.I got this as a gift for a friend of mine and am getting two more for myself!
3,Motorola Y charger Adapter,"The adapter works great despite some work to get it to plug into the bluetooth side. Other than that, it is great."
1,Seller is Bad,I placed my order on Jan 25 and now it is Feb-2 and the seller didnot ship yet. they already charged my credit card.DONT BUY FROM THEM AGAIN EVER
5,Don't need this with an H700,I have a Cingular 2125 phone and bought a Motorola H700 headset. I thought I needed this to charge the H700 and my Cingular (mini-USB) with one charger. Not so. The H700 uses mini-USB too.
1,Only charges phone with mini USB,"This Y-adapter will only charge a phone with mini USB and not the CE bus. So, if you have a phone that uses CE bus and a headset that uses mini USB (as I do), you are out of luck. Looks like I'm going to end up returning this item. I will post a picture how the CE bus and mini USB plugs are labeled as a confirmation of this limitation--which should have been outlined in the product description or photos."
4,Y Cord for Car Charger,"Seller shipped promptly. I received the cord quickly. Cord works great! the only drawback is that it fits the power cord a little too loosely for my liking. Even though it hasn't happened yet, I worry that the cord and adapter may become disconnected when I least suspect it and most need it. So far, so good though. Good product!"
1,Good product to address a design problem,"It works, but why can't Motorola design bluetooth headset that takes the same USB charger as their phones? The necessity of a Y-adapter just denotes a bad original design. Ever heard of ""interchangeable parts""?"
1,Won't accept the AC mini-USB plug.,"I tried to use it. If I pressed the connctions together any harder something was going to break. I've tried three times. Then, if I get them together, I'm not sure ever taking them apart will be an option. I've yet to get it to work. I believe it's going to be sent back very soon."
5,Willie Wonka,My son hasn't put this down since he got it. He's 6 years old and loves this game. It's easy for him to understand how to get to the next levels and the animation on this game are really great!! Even my 12 and 10 year old daughters love playing this game. I strongly suggest it!
2,Standard....,"I have saw this movie 3 times at the theater now and I sincerely wanted to love this game when I bought it. I can honestly say the game feels ancient in it's gameplay. You basically go from point A to point B without much in between. Very repetitive I must say with all of the things you have to do. Graphics are excellent though providing lipsmacking eye candy. Overall though, the game simply feels dated and it could have been much better than it is. See the movie pass on the game, or rent it if you can for the visual feast."
2,"Despite Amazon's description this is NOT a ""ball bearing"" fan","Bearing Type: BallNo, this is just a sleeve bearing fan. Contact the manufacturer and ask them. In fact it is printed right on the box! ""SLEEVE BEARING"". The problem is that I purchased this fan specifically to be mounted in a horizontal position. So what is the big deal you ask? Sleeve bearing fans are not designed to be run horizontally! They will quickly wear out and get noisy if mounted horizontally. Use your favorite search engine to look up the details. Basically ball bearing fans last longer and can be mounted horizontally without any problem.I learned this the hard way by mounting sleeve bearing fans horizontally. They would become loud and die prematurely even though the same brand fan was mounted vertically in the same case and was still running just fine.However this is an excellent sleeve bearing fan and will work just fine in the vertical position which it was designed for."
3,NOT BALL BEARING!,"Amazon's description is WRONG! Because of that, I BOUGHT THE WRONG FAN! Amazon states that the fan is ball bearing, but the box (in which the fan came in) says ""Sleeve Bearing"". Huge inconvenience for me, even though it's just a fan."
5,Great product,"This fan turned out to be better than I expected.1.It is very quite.2.It has a great build quality.3.It pushes air efficiently.4.It's cheap.I recommend this fan to anyone but be careful it's a 120mm fan and that makes it too big to fit in most PC cases, so if you know what you are doing then buy it."
3,Louder than expected,I bought this to replace a Xigmatek fan that had red LED's (which I didn't like the look of in my new case). This fan made my PC noticiably louder. I may just cut the LED wires on the Xigmatek and go back to that one. Guess I should have compared the noise specs between the two before purchasing this fan. A $6.99 lesson in the value of careful forethought...
4,great fan but,This is a great fan but it does not vary RPMs very much. It's always around 1390 or so. It plugs into the 4 pin molex for power and has a 3 pin with one wire to plug into your motherboard but it the motherboard can't change it's RPM. It just reads it.It is a good fan though. It moves a ton of air and is very quiet. I think it's the best fan I have. I just wish it was controllable.
5,Nice fan and quiet,"This 120mm fan is really nice. It's pretty darn quiet, and very powerful. For a basic 1-speed fan, you can't do much better."
2,"Irritating, pretentious, and too precious for words","Stoddard's work is a mess of contradictions. In advocating ""paring down"" to get to what is really important to us, she encourages more buying! Her suggestions and examples are drawn from her life and the lives of her friends - extremely wealthy and very similar to her. If you're looking to find yourself in a way that's inexpensive, non-elitest, and grounded in reality, this isn't the way."
3,"I like Alexandra Stoddard a lot, but I'd skip this one.","This book was okay, but not great. Stoddard's books on interior design are her true forte, and I will stick to reading those in the future."
5,The Extended Version!!!,"This single cd version containes the extended version of ""Everytime You go Away,"" as a bonus track. This version was not included in the double cd special edition from a few years back. I had to go on Ebay to track this cd down. It's hard to find. If you're able to get your hands on a copy, you should go for it!!!!"
4,"The sophomore effort, the American breakthrough/peak","Although I knew Paul Young prior to The Secret of Association, when ""Everything Must Change"" made it to the American Top 40, everyone else began to recognize Paul. With a super soulful voice, and some great melodies, this CD captured 1985 for me. Although the hits were ""Everything..."" and ""I'm Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down,"" highlights for me were ""Tomb of Memories"" and ""One Step Forward."" If I didn't already pay full price for it back in 1985, it would be mine at this price for sure."
4,Pino Palladino's greatest hits,"Who cares about Paul Young, it's Pino that's important.This album contains more of Pino Palladino's great bass stylings than any other album out there.A true treasure, that should be stored in that Smithsonian's exhibit of funkiest fretless fabrications."
5,Review From CHK Communications,"If chicken soup is the medicine for our soul, this book is an elixir for our contentment. The author, Tarin Frances, in her second book, gently leads us to understand that small things make perfection. She is firm in her belief that perfection is not utopia but attainable, taking one step at a time.Tarin paints an unpretentious picture where ""WE THE PEOPLE"" live in peace with each other: A Magical Peace. It is refreshing that a young, contemporary woman cares sufficiently to make us aware, that despite fashionable political correctness, we are still ""One Nation Under God."" And so she urges us also to be ""One Nation Under Love."" Perhaps a trifle too optimistic, but doubtlessly stimulating and positive. Delightful graphics with short entries make this an artful and enjoyable read. Another inspiring book in the author's ""magical"" series."
4,Seems like decent cable,"I'm not a pro, but the cable works fine and I have had no problems with it. I used it to go around my living room to my computer."
3,Decent Drive for the cost,"I only purchased this older drive because I needed an exact match for a RAID configuration. I haven't had great luck with these drives, this is the third drive I have had to replace in 5 years. I can't say if it is my system causing the failure or the drives themselves, therefore I rated this product okay"
1,didn't get product described,"Ordered drives based on the advertised revision number - drives that arrived were not as advertised, when i called the company to figure out options, i was told they would find the drives and call back - a month later, i am still waiting."
5,Much needed exploration of diverse interpretation of Plato,"This book is an excellent reference point for the philosophy major interested in Plato's thought and an enlightening walk through diversity of interpretation. Its informative introduction initiates the serious philosophy student into Plato's extended influence on the Western Tradition. What folows is a series of the most diverse interpretations of Platonic forms possible. This text is a study of the variety of philosophical investigations that Plato has inspired without disparagement of any single reading; it recognizes the intent of the dialogues in this way. Thus, this text illustrates the literary-philosophic intent of Plato in a way the master would admire. I suggest this text for anyone interested in the debate surrounding Platonic forms and for anyone interested in a comparison of widely different interpretations resulting from literary-philosophic exegesis."
2,not good,"pros: it came fast and good looking.it can take a beating. good for close range.cons: the stock falls off every time im using it. it doesnt have a hop up system,(wich is when the system makes bb go straight and it doesnt dive.) it dives and it doesnt go far."
2,Strictly C Grade Stuff,Elmo doesn't put his best foot forward here and Thomas The Train is 1 of the most pitiful scripts I've ever seen put to celluloid. You might want to skip this 1 unless your just looking for a bargain on 2 movies for the price of one for your toddler.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The stereo seperation on the CD is totally BOGUS!This is what it is:Left Channel: Melody/Lead GuitarRight Channel: Rythem Guitar, Bass, and Drums.This is what it SHOULD be:Left Channel: BassRight Channel: Melody Guitar, Rythem Guitar and Drums.Unfortunately it's impossible to isolate the bass or remove it so that you can improvise with the CD.Don't waste your time or your money on this."
1,Skip this DVD it's a waste of time,"This DVD was a disappointment and I should have known from the cover that this would be amateur. The French Bulldog puppy was cute, but that was the only dog you saw the entire time. Alot of the same video was used over and over, the music will drive you bonkers, and at some moments you feel bad for the pup because he looks like he is being suffocated and handled poorly by an overly enthusiastic little girl. If you are looking for an in depth video on the breed, it's needs and how to train it PASS on this video. Alot of it was just common sense. You are better off learning from Ceasar Milan or picking up a French Bulldog book."
1,Totally Generic...,"I'm sorry, but this video was useless to me... Maybe it's nice for a small child... I could find better information on Wikipedia. I would have at least been happy with gratitous puppy video but I only got to see the same puppy in the same puppy shots over and over... I think it was like 15 mins long... If you can get it for like $5, go for it, if not, save your cash!!!"
1,The product was good. It malfunctioned. Support was sorry.,"I loved the TV until it developed a mottled horizontal stripe about 3/4"" at random vertical locations. I called Samsung support who said it was out of warranty going by the date code on the TV. I didn't agree. They told me they had no remedy for me other than a full cost repair estimated to be about half the initial cost of the TV. They suggested I write to the office of their President to plead for a concession on the cost of the repair. I got no response at all.So, now my attic is graced with a useless relic to remind me never again to buy a Samsung product. I guess they don't need my business."
5,Wonderful advice in this book!,"This is a wonderful book for parents! It's written in 2-3 page chapters so it's easily readable even if you just have a few minutes. It's full of important reminders and stories that emphasize the power of encouraging words, appreciating children's feelings and lots more! I only have a few parenting books that I've kept and this is one of them. I even bought an extra copy for a friend."
4,Kayak Surfing,Great content - With the limited amount of information on surf kayaking it was great to read and learn.Would have given the book 5 stars but it was necessary to glue my cover on after a very short time-book was printed in China. Printing in China just doesn't do for a book you'd like to keep as a reference.
5,Kayak Surfing - a grate book about surfing waves with a kayak,"This is a grate book.I enjoyed very much reading the book.very well organized teaching of the wave surfing, staring from the very basic,and advancing to the most extreme surf tricks.beautiful inspiring pictures.I can definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in Kayak wave surfing.It is essential for the beginner, and grate for the advance surfers.Bill, Hope to see you in Israel some day.We have nice waves, warm water and losts of kayaks.You can plan on a trip to Israel next winter, when the water in UK is too could for paddling.ari.schkolnik@gmail.com[...]Ari"
1,cheap tea kettle,"&#65279;three people in my family bought this kettle at the same time and within a year, each of the three kettles had broken. the plastic around the whistling spout apparently doesn't hold well to the heat of normal use. Though a lovely and smart looking tea kettle, I would not advise this for someone who wants a lasting use kettle."
1,Cheap crap,"I bought this kettle and I threw it in the trash within a week. Its very tiny and can serve two people at the most but thats not the real issue. The real issue is that its just very light as if they used the thinniest metal they can get away with and so it feels so unsafe and dangerous to use. It a hasle to open the spout and its a dangerous bouring water out of it. Also because its so like, the heat transfer to the water is poor so water takes much longer tp boil. Just a flimsy, crappy product!"
1,Bad Replacement,"I had a Copco small teakettle that after years of heat and use, finally decided to come apart. I gathered this was a replacement, and offered a copper bottom. While they are shaped basically the same, the spout opening lever is cumbersome at best. The metal gauge is MUCH thinner, and so the thing feels flimsy. Handle and lid design are functionally identical to what I had. So I got out some epoxy and repaired the handle on my old one, and returned this. And the search goes on..."
3,Good value at $5,"Lasted a couple of years, until the bottom delaminated (due to high heat, mostly).Good size, makes a mean quart of boiled water."
1,no matter for jokes,"I am not Christian but I think this is serious business, Abanes should not make fun from these serious people concerned about our dark future. Concerning the problems ahead of us, I recommend instead Duke's My Awakening, and The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration, and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor.)"
2,Too Many of These Shows--Enough is Enough,"I've watched all six seasons of Project Runway USA. I've watched two seasons of PR Canada, 1 of PR Australia and 1 of Project Catwalk UK. I tried watching this, which has the same formula and I could only make it through one episode. There comes a point where you can copy an idea to death and we are at that point with this reality fashion show tv show idea. I really can't say it was terrible compared to PR but it was such an obvious clone that it was painful. As Isaac M and his top model keep exhorting everyone to be creative and original, I thought, ""Why don't you two start by coming up with your own idea rather than copying Project Runway in every particular? I hope this doesn't mean I won't be able to watch PR season 7, starting this month, but every idea has its day and 7 years in......yawn."
3,Acceptable,"My biggest reason for giving three stars to this bar stool is that it did not come with assembling instructions. Assembly was not difficult at all but instructions would have definitely helped avoid mistakes that cannot be corrected later.I did not realize that the chrome ring at the bottom of the cone seating had to be unscrewed and footrest to be screwed in before inserting and permanently locking pneumatic rod to the base and seating.A few minor imperfections in the quality, see photos for notes."
4,Religious,"I am not sure what my motivation was when I purchased this book, but I have read it a number of times. It is so spiritual. I could identify with most of the subjects Juan touched on. I felt like he was describing my life, it was so real. I believe he is truly a kindred spirt!"
3,hard to understand,"The book is kinda boring, and hard to read. The content is limited, not very interesting history book to read."
1,Delicious but Disappointing,"I couldn't wait to get the cookbook - I love the show and the food always looks so delicious. I dutifully read the first part of the book and was amazed to find no nutritional information or even suggested menus. Could I eat all of one recipe - two or three recipes at the same meal - how much, how often? While Kathleen knows intuitively how many calories she's eaten at any given time of the day, I don't. And I definitely don't have the time to sit down with my calorie guide and figure out how many are in each recipe. One day, maybe I'll know the numbers too, but until then, the cookbook is being sent back. When I know my numbers, I can use the book. Too bad, though, the food looks delicious. Unforunately, her approach is very, very disappointing."
4,Delicious Reading,"I really like this book. True, Ms. Daelemans has left out nutritional information but as she explains in her book, moderation is the key to successful weight loss. I did not have a problem with the lack of nutritional information but could see that being a problem for people that need to crunch the numbers. The recipes I tried were delicious (the chicken patties were fantastic as was the homemade granola) and very easy to make. My only complaint is that many recipes call for only sweet onions and say that if you cannot find sweet onions, you should pass on the recipe until you can. That was unfortunate because where I live, they are hard to find. The book also comes with some great tips to make easy lifestyle changes to help the weight come off. All in all a very nice book but I've given it 4 stars due to the requirement of some very specific ingredients for the recipes."
1,Overpromises and underdelivers,"This should have been called Living Thin if You've Got Good Eyes. The book is half about her story and philosophy and only half recipes. Reading the white-on-orange text of the various hints and comments is extremely difficult. MANY of the recipes have comments like ""Not something you'd want to eat much of"" or ""You can take just a sliver."" Why put in recipes that are fattening when this is a weight loss book? The numerous tips on how to make something a bit fancier (""if the Queen is coming to visit"" is cute, but quickly gets tiresome) are useful but printed in a way that makes them difficult to read. The design sucks; the recipes aren't particularly great and the ratio of recipes to lifestory is very low. I applaud her success, but next time she should sell her story as a story, not as a recipe book. You might want to buy this book, just don't expect much."
5,Wonderful book!,"Cooking Thin with Chef Kathleen is a wonderful book! It eloquently presents many of the important ideas from the Cooking Thin television program on the cable Food Network, plus more. The recipes are excellent, and Kathleen is humorous, compassionate, honest, and real. Since I discovered the Cooking Thin television program and book, I have lost 50 lbs. in three months and I am approaching my ideal goal weight. More importantly, I have made significant maintainable lifestyle changes involving healthy, delicious foods and exercise. Kathleen Daelemans is truly an inspiration!"
3,Cooking Thin?,"I'm not really sure how this book would help you to cook thin, although I do like a lot of the recipes. The problem for me was that none of the recipes had fat or calorie content and that is a must if I want to keep myself from eating the whole thing! I suppose that if you have self-control, this book will work for you. Chef Kathleen seems to have a great sense of humor which shows through in the book, but having been overweight herself at one time, I would have thought she would know how important keeping track of portion sizes, calories and fat is. Having said all that, if you are looking for a good cookbook with healthy and interesting recipes, this could be it!"
5,"I've lost 50 pounds with this book, my husband has lost 75!","All we've done is cook from the book and stick to the portions in it. We both exericse now but never did before. I walk and he goes to the gym for weight workouts. The recipes are easy, the ingredient lists are short. Chef Kathleen has lots of easy tips and ideas that are really useful. She's not pushing a diet or counting calories so if you want a strict program this isn't for you. If you want to lose weight ""slow and steady"" and forever, this is the book for you."
3,Where's the nutritional info?,"I was disappointed in this cookbook. While I appreciate the writer's expertise, honesty and skill, I cannot get over the fact that this is a *light* cookbook without *any* nutritional information! How many calories are in a recipe? How much fat? You'll never know unless you take the time to figure it out yourself. People using a cookbook called ""Cooking Thin"" are probably trying to watch their diets. How can they without such information? Anyone who reads the labels of products that call themselves ""healthy,"" ""light,"" and ""diet,"" know that they aren't always what they seem. Neither is this book."
4,"Good, only one disappointment","I love the book for the variety. My only complaint is that my favorite thing in the book (apple butter) was a complete failure. The directions for the apple butter were either incorrect or just simply do not work. My APPLES TURNED INTO LUMPS OF COAL. Besides that, the book is very good."
3,Love the show but not the book,"I bought this cookbook after watching Kathleen's show on tv. I love the show, tons of great ideas and a lot of motivating factors. However, I was disappointed in the book. There are some good recipes, but I don't find any of them particularly quick and easy. And that's what I'm all about. I was also very disappointed to find that there is no nutritional information in any of the recipes. For ""Cooking Thin"", some of these recipes didn't seem too healthful. I will still love the show, but like others I have had this book for months and haven't tried one recipe yet. It will sit in my collection, but probably not be used much."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,I love Kathleen's Food TV show so I thought the book would be a winner. I have to count calories and nutritional values and found it disappointing that the recipes do not include values. I know the recipes are low-fat and low calorie but the values would have been nice. The recipes are okay but nothing real eyecatching. I guess I'm glad I bought it at a discount.
2,very disappointed,"I couldn't wait to purchase this cookbook, but was thoroughly disappointed to find out that no nutritional values were given. How can that be? I have never seen a weight-loss book without one, until now! I need to know this info if I choose to put together an entire menu from this book, I wouldn't want to exceed my alloted calorie/fat intake for the day."
2,No Nutritional Information!,"The text is witty, the recipes look wonderful, but there is absolutely NO nutritional information in the book! There is a full-fat cheesecake recipe in this book. Kathleen's recommendation? Make in a small pan and eat a small slice. For most of us interested in nutrition, this is just not enough. I will have to use software to calulate every recipe in this book before I cook it to see if it will fit in my plan. Really bad decision...I have to give this a NO recommendation."
1,No Nutritional Data!,"I was very dissapointed in this book as were some previous reviewers. I enjoy Chef Kathleen's show, ""Cooking Thin"" , so I ordered the book. There is NO nutritional data at all !! I was also sorry to see that there were also no pictures of the recipes. I returned the book. It would have been easy for the editors to include the nutritional info. I did like reading how Chef Kathleen got Thin, but save your money and invest in another cook book!"
3,Also disappointed,"I really enjoy watching her show on the Food Network, but like the first reviewer stated, I was disappointed in the lack of nutritional information. And so many of her recipes, while delicious, are not all that healthy and low-calorie! This would be a great book for someone who is new to dieting, because it's certainly healthier than most of us eat. But other than ""cutting back"" and ""deciding to do it"" there isn't much information about how the author lost her weight or information about how her recipes will help the reader lose weight."
2,No Nutritional Information in this book,"How can you write a cookbook with light/diet recipes and not include Nutritional Information, such as fat grams/calories/fiber/carbs. etc.? The recipes look good, but I don't have time to figure out the calories etc. I am on Weight Watchers and it is impossible to figure out the points value of these recipes. I am very disappointed, I never would have purchased the book if I knew this info was not included. I wish one of the reviews I had read stated this info was missing. I hope this review helps anyone else that uses nutrional information to plan their diet."
4,Excellent addition to any collection,"If you're looking for a book that not only offers recipes, but also has helpful tips and tidbits, this is definitely a book worth checking out. I enjoy watching Kathleen Daelemans' show on the Food Network, so I was very eager to purchase her book. It has been an excellent addition to my already huge collection of cookbooks. We've tried several of her recipes and have found them all to be tasty and easy to prepare. She offers tips on how to cook ahead, ""morph"" one meal into another, and some tips on planning your menus. I really liked the fact that Kathleen talks you through the process of losing weight - she offers a lot of insight, especially since she went through the process of losing weight herself. I recommend this book, even if you aren't looking to lose weight."
2,cooking thin?,"spaghetti sauce simmered with pork ribs does not sound ""thin""to me.Any cookbook could be called thin if you only eat a 1/4 cup of the final product."
1,Disappointing,"The recipes in this cookbook are just ""OK"" and won't be repeated. The nutritional information is not included either, leaving me to run every recipe through my Master Cook software to figure it out myself. Cooking Light and Eating Well cookbooks are the best weight loss cookbooks I've tried so far."
2,Cooking Thin with Chef Kathleen,"I saw Chef Kathleen during a PBS pledge drive and one of her recipes intrigued me - the Baby Back Rib's sauce for pasta.Anyway, that is really the only recipe in the book that I've tried that I will do again. I have tried 3 others, and the results were not fabulous, to say the least. Most tasted like they were lacking something - problably fat or oil...But the Ribs !!! were really delicious and didn't seem ""lo fat"" at all."
1,very disappointing!,"I enjoy Chef Kathleen's Food Network show. And I thought that as someone who had lost a lot of weight, I would be able to get a lot of good ideas from her book. The good about the book is that there are not too many ingredients per each dish, so most recipes are easy to make. The bad is that serving sizes are not very clear in many recipes (the brisket recipe says it makes 10 servings with leftovers - how many leftovers? How do we know how much is base recipe and how much for leftovers if we don't know what a serving is?). Also, she talks about the importance of calories on pages 8 - 10, and again on page 80, saying she likes to know exactly how many calories she's having for breakfast, but there are no calorie/nutrition counts for the recipes! Perhaps she wants the emphasis to be on balanced diet, with good tasting food, but I frankly only wanted to read this book to get recipes with calorie counts. Without those, this book was a real disappointment."
5,Gorgeous!,"Gorgeous book - another great on in this amazing ""ology"" series. Definetly a great gift for the Harry Potter kid. Beautiful enough for any grown-ups collection as well."
5,Dumbledore and Gandolf have this in their libraries I;m certain,Beautiful hard bound book full of gorgeous illustrations and information.This is a must for any Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings fan as a companion book.
4,Even for Young Adults!,"Books like this - Wizardology, Dragonology, The Wandmaker's Guidebook, and other ""ology"" books are the very thing a young person just starting to learn about magick and paganism needs to get started. Even a young adult (age 16-24) who is just getting their first lessons could benefit from books like these. They are very practical and well-written - much too well-written to be simply dismissed as books only suitable for children. I recommend all the books in this series to kids and adults alike!!"
4,Even for real mages and witches...,"This is a solid, entertaining read. The short, concise chapters are an enjoyable read filled with myth, fantasy, humor, and just enough real facts to make it all sound credible. The book itself is a beautiful thing. Large though it is, it's great to look at. And besides, the book name-drops Agrippa. Any childern's book that can namedrop him is cool to me.The many pullouts, notes, and trinkets are also worth the 20 bucks alone.As I said, you could be a follower of Buckland, RavenWolf, Dee, Barrett, Mathers, Melville, Agrippa, and even if you still have that child-like spark, Crowley himself and find something to enjoy in this volume. I did."
5,Magical,Wizardology is a great book. It seems like Merlin really passed it on to you. There are spells in the pages and information about differnent wizards and history. The pages have colorful designs and cool flaps. All of Merlin's secrets and magic is in the book. Every time you open the book you discover something new. I could never get bored of this book.
5,FABULOUS,You must buy this bookJust looking at it is worth the priceMy 12 year old grandson is fascinated with itHow can they produce such a beutiful book for this price
5,wonderfully entertaining book...,"I consumed this wonderfully entertaining book in a day. I smiled, as it is a happy book for all ages to enjoy. I like to believe that magic exists today for all us clever wizards and witches!"
4,Wizardology,The book arrived in time. It had a few scratches on the cover by otherwise all was fine.
1,A book just for fun!,My grandson is an avid book reader but this book makes you slow down and check out all of the envelopes and hidden agenda within the book. Fun to read and watch the children read.
3,"Looks good, but poor quality","I got this a couple days later than the estimated delivery date. The outfit itself looks nice, but the fabric is cheap and flimsy. The belt is literally just a piece of fabric, I was somewhat disappointed with this to be honest. I even debated on whether to send it back or not. The buttons come off too easily as well, this might last me through a few photo shoots but I don't expect it to hold up very long. I really wish it was worth the $40 I dropped on it. I hesitate to purchase anything from this seller again."
4,almost perfect,"It's really a great product. Very nice box art on all sides of the box (except the inside :P) and of all the CDs in the limited ed. Lucky Star DVD boxes, the one in this one is my favorite. My only problem with all the limited ed. boxes is that you only get printed shirts rather than the actual uniforms. I wouldn't mind if it was some cheap version of the real thing, but just a printed shirt is boring.But all in all, even if it didn't even include the shirt, i wouldn't think twice about buying it. It is well worth the money as Lucky Star is such a great series :3"
2,Don't buy this book if you want to do home study!!,"This book seems to cover many important aspects of linear signal theory. However, there are no answers included,nor any student study outline. I have found that personal study using this book is very difficult. Don't buy the book if you expect any answers to double-check your results."
2,Disappointed,"It is hard to believe that this book is written by Huibert Kwakernaak. In contrast, his old book ""Linear Optimal control systems"" has already been a classic."
1,"Garbage: Great concept, bad execution",Great concept and highly recommended on travel blogs. But don't buy this product. I huffed and puffed but couldn't inflate them. Why? There needs to be an actual opening for you to blow into. Both the hangers had openings that were completely sealed shut.
2,Unreliable,"First, let me correct a previous reviewer - the hook is hard plastic, not metal. Not an issue for going through a security check.I took 2 on a recent trip to Europe, and 1 of them sprang a leak I was unable to plug with duct tape. I guess I should have taken 4. Fortunately, most places don't allow you to do laundry in your room anyways so it usually wasn't an issue.The one that worked worked quite well, although it was tricky to inflate and deflate (you need to deform the nozzle a little)."
3,"Not sealed shut, but not especially compact either","A couple posters have said that these were sealed shut. But they are not, it just appears that way. You have to squeeze the nozzle before you blow into it. Once you do this, the inflate in one soft puff.My issue with them is that they are not especially compact. They do fold up so they take smaller *dimensions* than a regular cheap plastic or wire hangar, but the overall *volume* is the same or slightly greater. But, they are also flexible when deflated so this is a plus.I think the main benefit is that they inflate into a wide hangar that keeps the sides of shirts from touching so they dry faster."
4,handy way to hang drying slothes,This is perhaps the best solution for hanging drying travel clothes up. The fact that the hangers pack down to nothing makes them all the more appealing.
3,"If you want to learn mistakes and bad habits, this is the book for you!","The blurb hardly inspires confidence when it cites as an example: ""faire du gaffe"". ""Gaffe"" is a feminine word, so the expression ""faire du gaffe"" is impossible. The translations of other slang expressions are also fairly dubious.Caveat emptor!"
3,"If you get this, you better no French!","This book is OK. I am just learning French, and this book is only for you if you know godd French. I like how it teaches you French you would learn when talking to someone. You don't always want to sound formal, and this book can make you a master of slang and casual talk. I gave this 3 stars because I don't know too much French, and it was hard to comprehend. If you know a good amount of French, then this is an excellent book! But if you're not . . . there are other books for you."
4,A twist on the Indian movie 'Who wants to be a millionaire',"A twist on the Indian movie 'Who wants to be a millionaire'The movie is great but at the end it plays on the Indian movie, good to watch though."
1,Foreign film....English subtitles,"I have no idea if the movie is any good or not, however when I start viewing a movie that has to be read, I'd prefer that it be a book, not a movie. The product description did not indicate english subtitles....I just got off the phone with Amazon....hopefully they're correcting that."
3,Read with skepticism,"I've revisited my copy of this book, in preparation for another visit to Florence. I was surprised to read a reference to a Da Vinci sculpture: ""That same year, da Vinci's statue Judith and Holoferenes was placed in front of the Palazzo Vecchio to symbolize the end of Medici rule."" Huh? Never heard of such a sculpture, and can't find a reference to it when I searched Google. Another ""small"" historical error appears when the author mentions that Savonarola ""took over"" the city. Huh? I don't think he ever took over the city. Bottom line: read this book with more than a little skepticism, as it relates to the history of Florence."
2,I'd buy a skirt..,"The quality of my product was very poor, far lower than expectations. The belt was the only decent quality product. I'd definitely wear a skirt or shorts over this because the shorts not only left nothing to the imagination in the front but it also had different cuts in the back. The left back side was more bikini cut while the right was more boy short. The hat was laughably tall, like a mushroom. I'd avoid buying this product and go with something you try on in a store. If you do decide to buy this product, it goes better with a push-up bra, a short black mini skirt, and skip the hat!"
1,wedding dress bag,"Shipping was fast. However, this bag is too small for a wedding dress. The material is nice it is just too small. I would hold a regular dress but not a wedding dress."
4,Great for wedding dresses,"This garment bag is great! I had been searching for one large enough for my wedding dress without much luck. I found this and decided to give it a try, it's perfect. Plenty of room for large items."
1,Wedding Bag,Bag has already ripped just hanging on the back of our bathroom door. Not very durable and would not recommend this product to anyone else.
1,Disappointed,"The other reviews make this bag sound like it can accommodate any dress even with a long train, etc. I was very disappointed! My Allure dress didn't come close to fitting in this bag. This bag would be great for a VERY slender dress with NO crinoline at all."
5,seamstress' choice,This Bag is desired by seamstress' who work with wedding gowns and the delicacy of them. This bag is excellent and will keep your gown Beautiful :):):)
5,Great Bridal dress garment bag,"This garment bag serves its purpose. I needed a big enough garment bag to put my bridal gown in - I was so glad my dress fit! I recommend it, it's not too bulky of a bag so it does not take up too much space in my closet."
2,Too expensive,I expected much more than what I received. This is a low quality bag given the price. I would consider $10 will be the worth.
5,Great Price and Quality,"My wedding dress was actually an evening gown, so I didn't need a big, expensive garment bag. I am very pleased with this one. It arrived on time and matched the description perfectly."
2,Grinds too fine,"This chops your nuts quickly - in small amounts - but the fine grate creates a nut ""meal"" and the coarser grate is just one step up - not like the little nut choppers with the glass or plastic jar on top. I prefer the end product to be chopped, but still recognizeable as nuts.It is also hard to direct the product to a container. A bowl or dish slides around and if you put a sheet of wax paper - it also slides. The unit is stable on the counter top but that way you can't put the paper under it. As for cleaning - the rim around the ""cone"" traps the fine nuts and they are difficult to remove. If they are not removed carefully - the remaining residue will probably go rancid.I am planning on returning the unit and going back to the ""little jar""."
5,Excellent Set,I purchased this around Christmas moving up from a smaller Sharp Aquos LCD and was concerned about some of the comments regarding 'Green Push' mentioned both here and on AVSForum. Using my HD Dish Network receiver and several HD-DVD players (all connected via HDMI) i have not noticed anything out of the ordinary - perhaps the green push issue is limited to analog inputs? Blacks are black and colors are spectacular! If anything images are too sharp and turning down the 'sharpness' setting results in a cleaner picture with less artifacts. This TV offers a myriad of adjustments i am still playing with. In summary this is an excellent set which delivers a fantastic picture and above average sound (if your not using a separate receiver).
1,0 for 2 - both sets had same critical issue,"The first one I ordered had an issue right out of the box where the entire right half of the screen was very, very dark as opposed to the left side. I tried hooking up different sources and they all had the same problem. Toshiba claimed never to have heard of the problem and suggested that maybe the shipper dropped it on it's side.So I took it back and ordered another, and lucky me, I got another one with the EXACT SAME ISSUE. Same advice from Toshiba when I called -- and they couldn't even find my original problem listed anywhere as the person I spoke to called this ""the only time he'd ever heard it happening"". Nice to know they are hiding some problems from consumers.Taking it back now and will not reorder."
2,Flaw after one month of purchase,"I bought 47HL167 for a month. I just found a red line on the right side of the screen this morning. No matter what chennal or input I tried, the line had always been there. One hour ago, the line is gone. What should I do with the TV? Will the line came back?"
4,Regza - An Obejective Review,"It gets a lot of criticism from from audio/video files because they claim the TVs often carry a blue hue. You can callabrate, but this one was fine.Negatives: Remote is big and clumsy. Has one of the worst sound systems, but almost everyone uses sorround so no big deal. It doesn't have as good a contrast levels as Samsung and Sony's high-end. Customer service was a joke.positives: The colors spectrum is as vibrant as there is-the technology they use is excellent. Well built, a little heavier and more durable then even the most expensive. ABout as much bang for the bucka s you will find in a LCD.If you are a truley picky viewer that demands to have the best available -run as fast as you can because this is not on that level. However if you want an above average HD that is easy to use and has most of the features you will need at a fair price put this on your short list."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,I have a similar Toshiba 47LZ196 that I paid $3499.99 for in Dec. 2006 that is just under 1 year and 2.5 months old and the panel ($3400.00) crapped out on me. After being informed by multiple Toshiba reps that I was in the window to receive assistance I was informed NOTHING would be covered and I was responsible for the cost of the part and repairs. What a joke for a higher end flat panel. One year and almost $4000.00 down the old crapper. Such a shame since I really liked that tv.
2,Not Happy,"Ordered the tv and the shipping was great and ahead of schedule. The tv's H.D. pictures are awesome, however the other channels are poor at best not to mention there is this small black spot under the glass of the tv. I called Toshiba and they told me analog broadcasts will look somewhat blurred and grainy on this tv and in Feb. of 2009 all stations must be digital broadcasts and no more analog which means the pictures will be better. She also said there will be more hd channels as time goes on.I've checked the reviews here and most are good and with no mention of poor pictures so I called again. This time a diferent lady said the the picture shouldn't be blurred and grainy and gave me a number to call and have a service tech check it out. He said he would have to take it to his shop to get it fixed. Bad tv."
2,Good Price But...,"I have not had the chance to look at this TV too in-depth yet, but messing around with it, it is superb for video, gaming, but I found one very critical flaw that is yet to be seen if it was just an unlucky coincidence or not. We tested a computer's video-out graphics card (GeForce 7600 G series [go]) and using an HDMI it downgraded the computer's HD capabilities from 1080p to 1080i...if you know anything about operating systems there is a big difference between 'i' and 'p' when it comes to a computer's OS. Blurred and a little hard to read at best, I was severly disappointed to know an off-brand Westinghouse LCD tv of the same size converted the video-out to 1080p, and looked crystal clear. For me, this was a HUGE kick in the face as I mainly bought this TV as a sort of HD media center...I plan on buying another HD GeForce HDMI card and testing it out, but I don't recommend a 7600 GO so far...I'll keep you updated with what I find out. Hope this helps any potential buyers."
5,Toshiba Regza beats Bravia & Viera For Quality & Value,"After a lot of research, we bought the Regza 47HL167 from Toshiba. This is a terrific TV, with a fantastic 1080P picture and surprisingly good native sound. At just over $ 1500, it's a bargain as well. Highly recommended for living rooms."
1,Horrible Quality,"Main board went out after 13 months. No warranty. $700 for part alone to fix, $1000 to repair with labor. Basically the TV is now a big paper weight. Horrible quality TV if components can't last more than 13 months. Called Toshiba, no help at all - ""out of warranty"". Do not purchase Toshiba products"
4,Excellent choice with options,"[...]As with any tv, you will have to adjust the picture settings to get it perfect but I find myself cycling through different presents ""Sports, Document, Movie, Standard, Preference"" depending on what I am watching. It is annoying for others but I am always trying to get the best picture possible. There is never any glare like others complain about plasmas.I upgraded to this after using a 26"" Toshiba CRT HDTV. The sound-card on this is amazing! The same surround sound system I had been using sounds 5,000% better hooked up to this REGZA. You will not be disappointed if you buy this tv."
4,Toshiba REGZA,"Great buy, the delivery was simple and on time. I'd use the white glove shipping again. The TV itself has a great picture and is simple to use for novices who weren't in the A/V club in high school."
5,"Great TV, Great Price, Great Service",We were really scared to buy such a big ticket item on Amazon. But we did and were very happy with the TV and the service. It got to our home on time and in one piece. The only negative is that we had to upgrade to HD cable service and get a new HD DVD player along with a handfull of new cables as the regular signal looks like crap.
4,Looks Great!,"I think the picture is awesome. However I was watching a 27"" 17 year old tube type before I bought it. This is the only HDTV that I have or have owned so I can't really compare it to other HDTVs. I did go to some local stores and try to compare them but I couldn't really see much difference in them. I think only someone who has owned and watched two different sets for a while can really compare them. The sound isn't great but look at the size of the speakers. I also think the owners manual could be more detailed but this is true of almost anything you buy anymore."
2,Ehhh...,So I have had other Pony shoes and they were decent but this one was made with cheap materials. It also ate up the back of my ankle when I would wear no show socks with them. F- for me.
2,sweet design but low quality,"The title says it all. The shoes look cool, but are made cheaply. Their most bothersome aspect is that the mid soles are not rubber or some other type of material and are instead wrapped around with some sort of tape thing and sewn. crap."
1,Very dissapointed in the bag.,"Very poor quality bag this is. The seams are not well finished, with threads hanging off. The strap is shaped in a weird way andcan not be adjusted. The zipper comes apart totally and is a huge pain to do up. I gave it as a shower gift and my friend returned it to me saying I should return the bag as it such a poorly made design! Is it returnable?"
4,*AWESOME*,"Finally a diaper bag I LOVE!!! It was shipped the same day I ordered it, and I received it 2 days before the estimated arrival date(I used free shipping option). I love the pockets on the inside, and how you can easily remove the changing pad. The print is very pretty! With 2 boys, I would have liked the bag to have a pocket on each side for easy access to sippys and bottles (it only has one pocket on one side)."
3,"I thought I would love this bag, but I don't.","The shoulder strap is nice and wide but mine has a curl in it, as if it wasn't turned all the way inside out after sewing. Also, the bag was sqaushed down width-wize into a box for shipping, curling up the plastic or cardboard support in the bottom of the bag. I wish the shoulder strap was adjustable. The fabric IS very pretty and soft."
1,Disapointing,"After reading the reviews this book got here on amazon.com, I ordered it.When I finally read it I was very disappointed. It's actually an achievement that Mr. Tansey's writing style is so uninteresting that the very exciting subject of the book, drifts away in a haze of boredom.It's like reading about the history of Spain by reading a few postcards from a beach bunny at Mallorca. Save your money and give it a miss. Haraldur Hallgrímsson, ICELAND"
2,nice for someone who likes to look at pictures of quilts,"First of all, I am an experienced quilter who wanted some new ideas. This book has beautiful pictures. Most of the blocks are applique, and only 30 are actual projects, mostly not quilts! But my main gripe is that there are no measurements for the piecing. So if you wanted to make a square you see, you would have to either sit down and work math for a while, or you could trace the diagram that some blocks have (not all designs have a diagram) and add a 1/4 inch on each side, but then your blocks would be quite small. I was very excited when I ordered this book, and very disappointed when I recieved it, I am sending it back tomorrow. good luck, I am ordering Nancy Martin's 365 quilt blocks today, hopefully that is better."
5,Great Interviews & Commentary on Navy Male Bonding,"The engaging stories told by Zeeland's sailors accurately depict our lives in the Navy. I bought the book after reading the great excerpts on Zeeland's website. I wasn't disappointed.These sailor interviews are very revealing and remind me of similar sailor ""networks"" I've been a part of. (The San Diego stuff brought back a lot of fun memories, too!)Zeeland's book makes me glad I crossed over that line - - in a number of ways."
4,The most accurate picture of being gay in the U.S. Navy,"Through a series of interviews, Zeeland accurately captures the real-life stories of gay men in the U.S. Navy. This great book brought back many memories of my own experience as a gay Navy officer."
2,Disappointing and poorly edited,"From the author's website and the titles of the three books I purchased, I was expecting something both steamier and more insightful. OK- I admit it- a lot steamier. Instead, the reader learns that although almost all of the men interviewed seem to be former sex partners of Mr. Zeeland, there is amazingly little sexual charge in the book. Furthermore, Mr. Zeeland gives the reader little insight into the inner workings of these gay military men. Rather, the book is an insight into him- a self-confessed ""military-chaser-"". Finally, the book is a dry, slow read- the book is an interview format, which I found tedious. This is a book that might be worth borrowing, but isn't worth purchasing new"
4,Informative. Everyone in the [U.S] military should read it!,I enjoyed this book! It gave me an interesting insight about the gay military members I serve with. It only strengthens my support for keeping gays in the military.
3,I quit my job and join the Navy now!,"Zeeland's interviews makes you think you're not in the right job if you're not in the Navy. It's almost an erotic book but the author bias on Navy men is sometimes irritating. Then again, i knew those Marines knew how to have fun...."
3,A little too advanced for true beginner,"I really just wanted to learn some basic greetings and phrases for an upcoming trip to Turkey. This CD starts off a little too advanced for someone who doesn't know anything, and who isn't ready to take up really studying the language. Starting out with some basic pronunciations would have been helpful. I read a review of another CD that people thought was too basic (breaking down words into syllables) and boringly repetitive... I probably should have gotten that one, but I was afraid I would have advanced out of it too quickly. I bet it would make a good companion CD to this one."
5,"Peaceful, mellow....","Good album, filled with mellow vocals & excellent dubs. Highly recommended for classical reggae fans. *****"
2,simple,"Info and quality were okay. No as much information as I was hoping for. If you are a beginner, probably more helpful. I found it to be elementary and simple. Not enough info. I would prefer to see more advanced workouts."
4,Total gym video,This is a great and fun video. The steps are easily to follow and can be used for a quick strength training workout.
2,Head Ache on CD,This is just not for me. I thought there would be more to it. I found it to be quite agitating.
3,Tomcat,"This is an adequate stand but is not the Flip-it model as described in the title description. Guitars are held in-place by a vinyl strap which definitely is not as strong as the Flip-it models - I have a single Flip-it guitar version. Have tried to get this corrected through Amazon without success. I have several expsensive guitars, including a 1978 Les Paul, that I want well secured."
5,Excellent Daily Devotional During Trials,"This book is an excellent daily devotional,separated by subjects for quick reference. This book changed my life and kept me focused on God through a very bad marriage and eventual divorce. I was alone during most of my trials so having Kay with her wisdom in this book strengthened my faith and walk with God. I have bought this book for other women in trials and it has greatly helped them also. Kay discusses many questions we ask ourself during trials and shows us scriptually how to answer these hard questions and where God is during our trials."
1,What Is Truth?,"The author of this book states that Ellen G. White spiritualized away Christ's second coming. I would like for him to give chapter and verse for that because she was looking for His literal return just like every other Millerite and Seventh-day Adventist. She often refered to it as ""the blessed hope"". If this author is wrong about that what else is he wrong about? Christ said ""Few there be that find it."" Study carefully a good KJV Bible and use a good concordance and study history. Read the books of Daniel and Revelation side by side along with everything Christ said about his second coming and prophecy (including false prophets) and you can't go wrong. ""Every word of God is pure."" With a prayer asking God for understanding He will guide anyone. The Bible explains and defines itself. ""Man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.""The one star rating I have given is too high but there was no lower rating available."
5,Jessy Jess,"Dear people,At first, I bought this tape because I'm totally obssessed with Marky Mark a.k.a. Mark Wahlberg. It is a really cool workout tape. I lost weight and my body is more toned than ever. I followed his nutrition and workout advices and it works! And I use it all the time for my workout! I'd give to this tape 10 on 5 if I could. MARKY MARK ROCKS!"
5,Beastis Boys best alblum ever,This group has some great music out on the market at this moment but in my opinion this is one of the best alblums Beastie Boys ever made. It takes me back to a time when their music seemed pure. This alblum is a classic. If you don't have it in your collection then it is a must get. I am actually buying for my teenage cousin. I know he will enjoy it.
4,Politics and Mountains,"This book provides a good history of WWII Greece during the German occupation. It explains the origins of espionage networks in Athens and, later, the formation of guerrilla bands such as EAM/ELAS. The book's main strength is its detailed coverage of timely events and politcal platforms, making clear the often complex web of powers, policies, and factions.Personally, I would've liked more details concerning the missions, supplies, and tacticts of the guerrillas; equal parts warfare and politics, instead of the heavier slant towards the latter, especially concerning the British SOE involvement.Overall a good book of history, politics, and foundations."
1,fiasco in spades,Package arrived on time. It was previously opened and obviously handled. Attachment hardware to install on my gun was present BUT broken making installation impossible. Anyone who packaged this order should have seen this so I would not have received defective merchandise. Low price for this item didn't excuse defective parts. I ordered the replacement part directly from the manufacturer. I would never purchase anything from this vendor.Gerald Goldstein
4,Amazing... Once installed,"Agree with the other two posters. I recently bought the fancier Hogue wood grips and they went on super fast and easy and looked amazing, but didn't provide the grip I was looking for from a compact revolver. I was excited to receive this grip, but unlike similar S&W applications, this was more than particularly frustrating. It got to the point where I was beyond frustrated and just had to finish mounting them on principle. Took a full hour to work them into place. Now that they are on, I love them, and plan to never remove them. If I do remove them I will dispose of them and go back to the factory Pachmyr grip or the wood Hogue again..."
5,Excellent Tester,"This unit has already saved me several dollars and hours of frustration by testing batteries that I thought were good, produced a good current, but were not lasting very long in my camera. They did not have enough power, and were going bad."
5,Outstanding Product,What an outstanding idea! Why didn't I think of this? Within two seconds you know how much life is left in your batteries. It tests almost every battery imaginable.
4,Much better than expected,"I considered trying one of the gadgets that pop into a holder to test the batteries, but some reviews stated they were inconsistent in results. I ordered this battery tester and am very pleased. I'm getting consistent results almost every time. My problem is holding the battery still enough on the contacts while the results are determined. I'm also pleased that it measures the battery with a load test."
1,Very inconsistent,"I test mostly 3V lithium, AA, AAA, and D alkaline batteries. Unless they are new and at 100%, the readings go between 60/80%, 40/20%, and sometimes an 80% read will be followed by a repeat test of 20% or 40% or vice-versa. I'm beginning to think some peoples' recommendations that I get a multimeter instead of this tester are correct."
3,A bit of a trick to operate.,Holding a battery on the tester and the negative probe on the end and pushing a test button takes a little to get it right.Anyway it gives me a way to compare batteries and sort of match levels to each other. It definately lets me know if it is dead and will probably save me from throwing away batteries because one has gone dead.I would prefer an analog device but his will do.
5,IT WORKS!!,"This battery tester is great for testing all types of AA or AAA rechargeable batteries. It's easy to use and clearly shows the amount of ""power"" left on your batteries."
4,for what it's worth,"It's compact, easy to use, and works. I just wish there was an AC power option, instead of having to use 4 AAA batteries (sort of quixotic); but I knew that prior to purchasing. Satisfied with this purchase. It's nice to be able to sort out dead batteries from useable ones!"
5,Great charger,"Great tester. Needs 4 AAA batteries to run. Once I found those, it works great. Make sure to test your batteries two or three times in order to get the most accurate reading."
3,"Not Perfect, but not too bad","Do not think for a second that this device will give anywhere near an accurate reading. It gives results as a percentage (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) and it is very inconsistent. A typical battery, tested five times in a row, will give results of 0%, 80%, 60%, 40% and 60%. What's the battery strength? Probably around 50%. Who knows? The more you test a battery, the more you'll start seeing a particular percentage show up. That's probably the true strength of the battery.I don't think it is a defect with the product. It is probably due to the fact that testing a battery in this manner is not an exact science. That being said, I test each battery 4 or 5 times and I always get a pretty good idea of the strength of the battery.Take note . . . this battery tester does not work with button cell or other watch batteries."
5,GREAT TESTER,"I use this tester for everything. It is handy and a must have for checking toys,clocks,candle batterys,you name it if it has a battery it checks it and load test the battery, It will save you money in the long run not throwing out good batterys when one is bad out of the lot"
5,This does what is says it will do and made in the USA,"Really like this battery tester, if I'm not sure on the result, I just take another reading or two. This size is small enough to fit in a kitchen drawer."
5,works great...,"I went through a bag full of batteries that my kids had been putting ""dead"" batteries from their games in. A few of them tested out dead but there were a lot of them that were still at 80%. I like the fact that this tester puts a load on them, I think that's where the difference is between this one and the typical voltage tester. So far it seems to be working great because the once thought ""dead"" batteries are now being used and are working great."
1,Very Inconsistent,"I had high hopes for this tester. I tested a batch of 6 AA cells which were at various levels of charge. I cleaned the contact ends of each cell with alcohol. If I tested a cell 6 times I would often get 3 or 4 different readings! It could read full cells pretty well but if a cell was at 40, 60 or 80% it would get the very inconsistent readings including regular 'dead' readings but the next reading would be 60% then 40%. I checked the cells first on two testers that I have been using reliably for a long time."
5,zts mini battery tester,very useful and small tester for almost any kind of battery.I have ordered several of these for personal use and for gifts.
2,Faked Days in Roswell,"This film really belongs in the category of ""Mockumentary."" Most of the scenes are terribly contrived and our hero, Richard Kronfeld, comes across as a nerd playing even more of a nerd. You are constantly aware that he is mindful of being on camera and is playing to it. This is true of most of the performers--the word that best fits the people in this film. The outtakes you can view on DVD only further this observation (the scene with the luggage on the stairs is embarrassingly amateurish). As a result, ""Six Days in Roswell"" is about as funny as a government film of crash test dummies.I'd give this film one star for being just plain stupid, except that it introduced me to singer Suzanne McDermott, who gives us the most honest, genuine and professional performance in the entire film."
4,"Some of these, I just don't get","I got this for my husband. He kept saying, ""I think you would like this book...""So I read it, too.This is a book about power and speed and LOTS of cash and being a guy -- and that's okay with me. Do I understand why a bunch of broke teenagers want to spend every penny on decibel drag racing? Nope. But I can be glad for them that they have found a creative new way to be competitive and tinker around with stuff. That's what it's all about.Thanks, Stephan Wilkinson. Each one of these articles was interesting. We're a military family, and some of these military vehicles... well, I already had a huge appreciation for the guys who piloted them, and now that I understand the vehicles better, the prestige of these guys grows even more for me."
5,Excellent!,"I bought this book because as a Chem major, I frequently have to refer back to my General Chemistry text for reference. Mine was a paperback and falling apart. This came before the estimated date, and it was in excellent condition, with hardly any visible signs of use. Will definitely order books from this seller again when it's an option!"
3,"Good, but ....","In general this is an excellent chemistry book. I had just finished Linus Pauling's 1970s text and I wanted something a little more up to date.First, like most modern texts, I found it dummied down compared to the older text.Second, I find the format difficult to read. The extra wide pages make speed reading very difficult.Finally, like most American based chemistry books, I get a little bothered with the importance of the SI units, but then have a sectionof questions in feet, miles, teaspoons. If SI is important (and I believe it is), stick with it.All in all, good text. As good as Pauling's ..... well, they will be both on my book case, but Pauling might be a little closer to my desk."
5,a chemistry book for all science purposes,THIS BOOK IS A GREAT GUIDE FOR ANY STUDENT WHO WANTS TO LEARN CHEMISTRY AND ALSO A GREAT GUIDE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO PREPARE3 THEM SELVES FOR WHAT'S AHEAD AT UNIVERSITY.
5,Educational,You can't appreciate Passover or Easter untill you view these lessons. Very informational and inspirational. I learn something new each time I vew them.
4,good but more details needed,"DVD okay, but more details about the study book that is included should be given. Item was a little slow coming but this may be due to time of year."
4,"I've looked for the ""Pre""-quel for years!","I read Hellstorm many years ago and it sent me on a compulsive search for the previous book, Black School, that has lasted to this day. Hellstorm involves a small group of people who risk their souls by embarking on a mission into Hell itself to save humanity. I enjoyed it so much that I needed to find the first novel to complete the story. I'm beginning to think that I might have to go to Hell and back myself to find it. I need to read Hellstorm again to remind me how they got back. I'm looking forward to reading it again."
4,Very Good,"These shoes are great. They are comfortable and stylish on. You need to wear them like any shoe to break them in, then they feel like a tennishoe. Wish they had more colors, I'd buy them all!"
4,MY GRADE: B minus to B.,"First off, be warned this is a foreign film so you have to deal with subtitles which bothers some Americans. Tale is about a sociopathic female arsonist woman (Jeanne Moreau) in a village who uses superstition to her advantage and floods the town and then gets the foreigner accused of the crime. She does several other bad things along the way, including the destruction of eggs in a bird nest when the momma bird is away. Viewers may wonder if the psychotic woman a la mademoiselle is demonically possessed but it could go either way by interpretation. Look for the sexual themes every time she commits an ""evil"" act, especially in her makeup and what she wears. It won and was nominated by BAFTA for a couple of awards. It's a bit dated for our times but worth a look.STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY/TONE/SETTING: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of April 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B."
4,Milwaukee hammer drill,"Milwaukee makes great products... this is like most Milwaukee products, well built, reliable and plenty of power...."
1,Cottages for birds,I bought five of these bird cages in all the various styles. I thought they were adorable but as the other buyer stated they are impossible to clean. No pull out draw!!! What were they thinking. I don't know who designed these cages but I don't think they owned a bird. After the color of the pan started to peel off I threw them out. They enraged me. I know I should have sold them because they are very expensive. But if I sold these cages I know they wouldn't have been happy with me. I couldn't do that to someone else. If the manufacture reads this please design one with a pull out draw. Thank you. They are very cute and made very well and I love the cottage designs but being practical they are not. Sorry I had to give it only one star.
3,Pinky's house,"Cute but not too practical. There is a big gap at the front of the catch tray that allows debris to escape. The ledges around the perimeter that hold grate & tray are impossible to clean, seeds work into joints & it is very tedious to try to clean. The rear ""timber"" piece could not be attached & I ended up wiring it on.On the up side my parakeet is happy with her new digs and my 4 year old Great-Grand-Daughter loves Pinky Dinky Doo's new ""mansion"". It is quit roomy."
4,"A well-researched, scholarly tome with Leatherface on it.","Wow...I don't really know what I expected from this book, but it's certainly much more informative than it has to be. From instances of criminal and hunger-forced cannibalism in the 20th century to a look at the shared themes of horror movies and fairy tales, this book delivers again and again. There are quite a few typos that I found distracting, and some of the photos look like they were digitized to be put into the book, but not restored to photographic quality. This makes some of the photos look like old Atari graphics. Those minor yet annoying flaws are what keeps this from being a five star book."
2,Kept from brilliance by an amateur author,"MEAT IS MURDER contains facts and anecdotes that an ape couldn't make unintersting; however, Mikita Brottman sure comes close. I'm obsessed with cannibal culture. I love reading the horrific accounts of factual cannibalism, and I froth over any film using it as subject matter, from Italian greats by Umberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodato, to Bob Balaban's hardly related PARENTS. Therefore, I absorb MEAT IS MURDER's parables voraciously, but with extreme resentment. I don't know how Brottman slipped by Jack Sargeant's keen eye for brilliance, but her ""style"" borders on tedious, and is completely soulless and without voice. This one's for extreme fans only. A little creativity would've been much appreciated."
1,murder to read,"Creation Books went through a dry spell during the late 90s and have now pickedup a good head of steam. This book must be the low-point of their publishing agenda. They must have been handing out the PHDs on the day Ms Brottman got hers. This book is sloppy, contentious and pretentious. An intellectual who writes about trash movies and (yawn) taboo areas of the human psyche? Totally passe, darling! Compare this rubbish with Jack Hunter's 'Inside Terradome' also from Creation and it becomes obvious that Ms Brottman is nothing more than a jobbing deconstructionist shamelessly looking for somewhere to get her name in print.Don't buy this!!"
5,Wonderful ring,My daughter purchased this ring for herself and I must say it is beautiful. It is a very dainty ring so don't expect anything big but the craftsmanship is perfect and the ring sizes are spot on. It came nicely packaged in an adorable white ring box. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,A Renaissance Soap Opera!!!,"I had to read this in college for a Literature class and absolutely loved it. Before reading it, I assumed that I wouldn't be able to relate to it or enjoy it because it was written in the 14th century, but I was pleasantly surprised. The themes of the various short stories would fit right in with anything found on television today. This book is still a part of my personal library to this day!!by Kardia Williams"
3,The Howard Stern of the Middle Ages,"Yes, the Decameron is an iconic classic, and a fascinating and valuable piece of medieval literature, and I did find some of the stories funny and entertaining, but is it really of value today on its own merits or only as a historical/literary artifact? Most of its very predictable stories revolved around casual adultery, fornication and/or scatalogical humor, which doesn't necessarily condemn it as a piece of art, but I personally found the majority of the tales to be either silly or prosaic. Read it if you have the yen; it's divided into easily digestible tales that will enable you to put the book down for any length of time and not lose any sort of continuity when you pick it up again. Just try to read it without any preconceived notions of veneration, just because of its age."
3,A somewhat disturbing image of the human condition,"Either this book doesn't describe reality or does so with horrible accuracy. Your take on this precept will color the Decameron's perception. For me, it was heavy overdose of the human condition. Too much so, it left me sick at points with the backbiting, the lying, the scheming, the broken promises, and the general malaise towards covenantal bonds. The low points covered were many, perhaps reflective of humanity itself. There were high points, however, (Madam Beritola and Griselda come to mind) and many of these were later incorporated in the Canterbury Tales as well."
5,Forget everything you learned in catechism...,"...that is if you don't want to go to bed feeling extremely guilty every night. I had to read this over 6 weeks while studying in Tuscany. It is quite humorous and interesting, however it goes against everything that I learned in Catholic school. Ironically most of the dirty deeds being done are by those who've been chosen to ""spread the good word.""It is fabulous however when reading it one must forget their background and dive in over the top to be able to move through the book.Are the stories in the Decameron true? I hear the sequel is being relived right now all over the country."
2,No TOC,"This is for the Kindle version: Love the translation, it is far better than the free products. But, there is no table of contents. With 100 stories and a price of almost ten dollars, I figured that is what I was paying for. Really disappointed considering I got the print version for three dollars at a used book store."
5,Wonderful Tales of Itlay During the Black Death,"I can't emphasize enough how enjoyable this book is. It is similar to Chaucer in some respects because the collection of tales are supposedly told by seven ladies and three gentlemen when they meet in a Florentine church to discuss how to avoid the Black Death. Each tale is a masterpiece in its own right. The tales are as lewd as Chaucer's, but the wit is dealt with a very light hand. But Boccaccio presents a very human world with his tales, and through this we get to know each of his storytellers very well. I recommend this book highly. It's a lot of fun, and it will make you laugh out loud."
5,timeless masterpiece,"If you think the Middle Ages where a time of religious fanatism, this book will help you realize how incredibly varied life was. It is really funny and surprising to see how people haven't changed much. This book is not about the Middle Ages, it is about human nature. Wonderful, funny and a classic."
3,BUYER BEWARE/ NOT WHAT I THOUGHT!!,"When I purchased this item for my dad for christmas I bought it because the item desciption said that it was 1.3 HP. On Christmas eve when he opened it, the motor said 1/3 HP. The only reason I went with this one was because of the added power. I was very disappointed when I discovered that I had actually purchased the smallest horse power grinder available. If you still want this product the name is good, just beware that it is not the horse power that is advertised."
1,It is like a kids toy,The product fell apart the first time it was used. Within the first 18 holes of golf; the end of the scope came off and this scope doesn't really give you a excellent range to the flag stick. I would spend more money and upgrade to a higher quality of scope if your a serious golfer. This became a kids toy.
3,UNO Blitzo,UNO Blitzo is a fun game to play with your friends. The bad part is only four people can play at a time. Another thing I don't like about it is it is the luck of what they say and not what you draw. I personly like the cards better.
5,"Up,up Down is a great book for a kid.","The book Up, Up, Down was a good story and a funny one. I liked the part when Anna climbed the tree. My favorite character is Anna because she started climbing all these things and I thought it was fun. I think Robert Munsch is a very good writer and Michael Martchenko is also great illustrator."
5,A Recommendation by Jordyn,"Up, Up, Down is about a girl climbing up the tree. There was very silly things in the tree. The mom falls and bumps her head. hehehehehe! The same thing happens to the dad. He almost got it! hehehehe! The kids bring humongous band-aids so the parents can't walk talk or hold the kids or take their clothes off!!!! I like it because it is so funny. My favorite part was when the kids brought the big band-aids and they were wrapped around. I like all Robert Munsch books!"
1,Disrespectful to authority,"We received this book as a gift. After reading it, I promptly threw it away. It is about a little girl, Anna, who is disobedient, defiant, and disrespectful to her parents. I don't want my children or any children reading it in my home. In the end, Anna the naughty little girl wins. Not a good moral."
4,Good product,It seems to work and the magnesium is good for men anyway in various ways. Doesn't mesh well with an empty stomach though and can cause heartburn. Take with a bite of something.
1,wtf....,"WTf is having to dance and do stupid low-rider crap to music? GTA is supposed to be about fun missions, packakges, rampages, killing people, blowing up stuff....not dancing and low-rider b/s. But i guess they had to make one for all the crack-dealers and such, the ghetto warriors needed one to play too i guess...jesus, just please don't make a sequel to this...and i'm not saying this b/c you are a ""gangsta"", i'm saying what the hell happened to the old GTA style??? The missions do kind of suck in this one, i still love to play GTA 3 and GTA Vice City on XBOX...but this game ruined the GTA series...i should have known it was gonna be too ghetto-fab. What a waste of $$$..."
1,Did not Work!,"I bought this game and I inserted it into my xbox and it said ""ERROR"" The disc was scratched up bad and I wish it would have said it in the description. Never buying from Amazon again..."
5,Funnest game ever!,Its a great killer of time and fun to play (as are most of the GTA series). Violent games don't lead to violent crime - violent people do. So pick up the game and have some fun!
5,the good game.,"This game is great but there is languge,violence,and a strip club. Do not buy this for a kid!"
5,Amazing in all ways,"I have played both console versions of this game, and the only differences are:1) The loading times2) The graphics3) The first 10 minutes of gameplayThe first ten minutes of gameplay in this game shows the funeral for CJ's mother, and that is the only huge difference.The game is great, I'm not going to tell you any more so that I don't ruin this masterpiece. Have fun with it!"
5,BEST GAME FOR X-BOX!,"Grand theft auto San andreas is by far the best game for x box. I love the RPG type of feeling you get with this game with all the choices you can make such as your outfit, hair style and tatoos. The grapics are much better and now there is even a mini Co-Op version. This game lasts forever and almost has an endless amount of playing time. I highly recomend you get this game. This game isn't for immature kids though, I'm 14 but my parents know I know the difference between a game and real life. This game has lot's of swearing and blood but the game it's self RULES!"
3,Not as good as Vice City,"San Andreas was a huge dissapointment for PS2, so I had no idea what to expect when I began it for Xbox. It was a lot of fun, but a lot harder than Vice City for Xbox. In comparison of the two, San Andreas is much more violent and the language is unbearable. I don't necessarily regret buying the game, but if you are looking for a fun game, and don't have Vice City I highly recommend that instead of San Andreas.The pros of this game are that the city is much larger, many additions to vehicles, and creative original missions that don't get old.Between the violence and language; and the improvements since Vice City, I would say the game cancels out to be an ""ok"" game."
5,Fantastic,Game arrived in a timely and orderly fashion. It Actually arrived 4 days early :) very happy with this seller
5,Grand Theft Auto San Andreas - ROCK ON!,"I've been playing the Grand Theft auto series since part one was released. As each release comes out, they just get better and better. Rockstar gives me just what I want in a video game - and more. Videogames arent just for Kids. I'm 28, and I play this game several times per week. Thumbs up to everyone at Rockstar for this --- and people, be careful for letting the 'Hillary Clintons' of our country make their decisions for us. Parental control starts with the word ""No"" and the flip of a switch. If we're not careful, we're only going to be able to play games like ""Super Pope 5000"" and ""Sim Church."""
1,this game sucks!!!!,This game came today and I was mad what I found in it guitar hero world tour and I cant even play it DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB GAME!!!!!!!
3,Cool,This game is fun and maybe even a little too ghetto but I had a good time playing it. The graphics are old school.
5,awesome,i love classic games like this. I wish more ppl liked games like this. Thanks alot. keep it up =-)
2,SILENT PARTNER,"Audio is very clear, however within three months it stopped ringing. I have to be close to it when a call is coming through, because the front lights up indicating that it is ringing. I just have to put up with a lot of missed calls until I purchase a 'RINGING PHONE again.'"
4,black metal corner computer desk,"The desk does a fine job of fitting into a small space and holding many office needs. It is a bit wobbly, but very practical. The chair is also handy and fits anywhere, even as an extra sitting space when chairs are at a premium."
3,"Fantastic Show, but be careful.","This is a fantastic show, and I'm hooked on every episode. It's interesting to see what people have, and they stories they bring in with their piece that want to sell or pawn. That being said, be careful. This is VOLUME three, and not all of season three. If you take a quick look, you'll see ""three"", and one might think it's the full season of Season 3, it's not. It's just some episodes from Season 3. If you go into it knowing that, you should be fine.I really like seeing how Rick, The Old Man, Corey, and Chumlee interact with each other.If you've seen the show, or Seasons 1 and 2, you know what to expect and won't ' be disappointed."
2,only so-so,"I initially enjoyed this show but as I watched it, I found that it was repetitive and difficult to swallow. So many of the items that come in on this show are just not believable as just popping up for some pawn broker to buy. Also, as a resident of Las Vegas, I found that the people running this store are shockingly rude and full of themselves. Overall, fun to watch for a few episodes but lacks any real staying power. No idea how it has made so many seasons."
3,Arrogant,"After watching 40 or more episodes I have learned to dislike the characters/owners. Visiting experts appear biased; ""what are your concerns?""."
4,Outstanding,Me: I am not an expert in stars but I have a buddy that is. Let me call him over here and we can see how many stars Pawn Stars Season 3 is worth.Expert: This is a genuine good show. Definitely worth five stars.Me: So its worth 5 stars but the best I can do is 3. In today's market stars are not cheap. Plus I need to fix it up because it is in rough condition.Rick: How about we meet in the middle at 4.DRUM ROLLMe: Alright you have a deal.
4,Sixteen episodes of fun fun fun,"What I enjoy about the DVDs is there are no commercials. That seems to cut an episode down to about twenty minutes. And, I always like watching the good old boys wheel and deal in merchandise which is often a sight to behold. Unfortunately, this set is not the complete season and I have no idea who the fans were that made the selection of their favorites. I would have preferred the entire season with the option of skipping over a clunker episode. Still, you have to appreciate what you get."
1,False Advertising - Content Less Than Full Season,"Buyer Beware !The cover art says ""Volume Three"" - the text says ""The Complete Season Three""Episode count doesn't = entire season worth of episodes !"
3,Pawn Stars Volume 3,"Great show, Just beware that this is not the whole season 3 like the first 2 they came out with this is just a few of the shows. So save your money and look for the whole season else where."
1,Overpriced!,Not sure what amazon is smoking but these prices are CRAZY. Last month they were 8.99 a season for pawn stars. If you want to watch them I recommend watching on netflix as they have all the seasons and the price is 7.99 a month.
5,great show!,"wonderful show very entertaining, I have watched this show for years and will continue to watch as long as there are new episodes!"
1,Junk,"Broke first socket within secounds of opening package on 3/8 IR impact gun. Also bought 1/2"" set and broke that one also"
4,A fun little book about a dumb rabbit reading a public library book about wolves.,"Have you ever gone to the library to learn about something? Sure we all have at some point or another. Anyway, the main character in this book is a dumb little rabbit that picks up a book at the library on wolves and as the story unfolds the rabbit learns a few facts about the dog-like animal. Ultimately the little rabbit learns that wolves like to eat rabbits. I'm not sure the little rabbit found this out from reading the book or from the wolf he ran into as the story progressed. You read the book and find out.I found it kind of odd that there were two alternative endings to the story. I would have liked the book better if there had been just one ending, but having two endings didn't ruin the story.The illustrations in this book were quite imaginative. However, I was a little surprised that the rabbit was so small that he could walk on the bridge of a wolf's nose. 4 stars!"
5,Extraordinary -- maybe not for littler kids,"The illustrations make this book one of my boys' favorite books of the year so far. The different styles and the scrapbook/library book feel are original and clever. Your little readers, of course, are in on the joke as it unfolds.Be warned - there is a non-specific violent ending, plastered over with a fake happy ending - this means my bigger boys LOVE it, but little children may get a bit freaked out by the scarred and claw-torn library book cover and the unclaimed mail..."
1,Not for beginners,"Although the first couple of lessons on the CD are OK for beginners, the CD rapidly progresses to complex dialog. The CD would probably be more useful with the companion book or as an adjunct to another course in Slovak. By itself, it is not helpful."
1,Stay away!,"Not much to say, except - stay away! I got this book for my wife to learn some basics as I introduce her to my language... Not only have I found this book incomplete, it is full of actual mistakes and misinterpretations of Slovak grammar. It is unfortunate, that there is such a limited number of Slovak grammar texts in English, and the few available are this bad. I recommend obtaining Slovak middle-school texts, which are much more precise and correct. Slovak is a very grammar-centric language; one will never master it without a good grammatical foundation!"
4,Slovak pronunciation help for you,"To be used in conjunction with the book of the same title. Good pronunciations help with practicing Slovak. Moves pretty fast for a novice, though."
1,Too complicated.,We're planning a trip to Slovakia this summer and will be meeting relatives for the first time. The younger generation all speak English but we just wanted some basics in Slovak. We found this course way too complicated.I returned it.
1,Misleading description - NO book included,"I looked at all the reviews for this product, and at the product description itself, and there is no indication that it is only a CD (audio) but doesn't include the book. The title says ""[audio CD]"", but it also says ""the complete course."" Most of the reviewers made statements about the book. The description also states ""368 pages"" next to ""audio CD."" And there's even information about reference pages. It's all very misleading, and I ordered this item based on these statements, leading me to believe the book and the CD were included. I only received the CDs. I cannot use the CDs without the book."
1,Colloquial Slovak- A waste of time,"I am currently studying from J.D. Naughton's book and I have come to the conclusion that it is the worst text book I have ever come across. The conversations in the book are not relavent to every day life and so usually a waste of time. Also he puts words in the conversations which have no translation on the page and are NOT in the Slovak-English dictionary section at the back. After extensive investigation you find that the word was mentioned and translated in a conversation some 10-100 pages previously, and only once! So what you have to do when you come to these words is look back through EVERY conversation in the book until you find it! It's ridiculous! I have learned many languages in my time and have a lot of Slovak freinds who after being shown the book also agree that it is more of a waste of time than it's worth. Don't get it."
5,Awesome Experience,"I finally found the album I was looking for, and it got here in record time and is in great condition!"
3,A sorry piece indeed,"Julien Dedman, author, was a wonderful cartoonist and author, much loved ever since his early drawings published when he was a Yale Undergraduate in the late 1940s. If you ever go to Mory's Restaurant in New Haven, you will mounted in the front lobby a framed origi9nal of his cartoon of an inebriated Yalie tripping on the front steps of the restaurant and asking ""Is this the place that Louis dwells?"" If you don't understand this, not to worry. Inside joke for Yalies. But in THIS book, written 40 years later, the dark side of this much admired man emerges in this malignant tract against the progressive leadership of Yale University during the Presidency of Kingman Brewster. I didn't know Dedman. Almost all of the principals to this history have since passed on. But as a great admirer of his art, I am saddened by this dour diatribe."
4,tight collaboration,"While many cross-cultural collaborations produce uneasy truces that fail to retain my interest, this recording ranks among the best of the lot (like Hank Jones' ""Sarala"" or Fred Ho's ""Monkey Orchestra"" recordings). This edgy klezmer ensemble blends effortlessly with the North African rhythms of the drummers, and their tight improvisations in cuts ranging from 5 to 11 minutes allow the musicians the opportunity to explore the common frontiers of their surprisingly compatible muscial traditions. There's nothing canned, contrived, or deadened about this recording: ranging from the languidly sensual (in arabesque fashion) to the muscular straight-ahead (right from the city), this is the Real."
4,Intersecting Genres of Soundz ... I Like It,"These artists are evolving.This collaborative effort combing Electronica, Dance, Rap, Reggae and so on is refreshing.The music (melody & orchestration) is outstanding.The lyrics (though very reflective of the world today) are too politically based for my space.That said, there are at least six songs on this release that warrant a purchase.Their next compilation should be awesome."
4,Trip Hop at its best,"If you liked Massive Attack's ""Protection"" album, odds are good that you will love ""To All New Arrivals"". ""Protection"" hit hard by having ""Everything but the Girl"", this one fights back with ""The Cure"" on the second.This album always had a strong emotional impact on me. Any parent or parent-to-be will be moved by the lyrics. Listening to the lyrics on ""I Hope"" were for me unbearable today, the day following the Sandy Hook School drama:""I hope you outlive your parentsI hope you never bury your children""Music is excellent, I would have give a five star rating if it wasn't for one or two weaker tracks."
2,nothing like their previous albums,"Faithless is one of my favorite bands. Reverence and Sunday 3am have been on my playlist since i first heard them. But since then their works have degraded and with this release it has hit rock bottom.What's sad is that the music itself isn't even that bad (though it's been done before, and feels lifeless), what just drags it into ""terrible"" is the inclusion of the kid (i'm guessing Sister Bliss's child, i didn't investigate though the CD jacket includes info about the kid... simply put i don't care). I can understand the inclusion, but it breaks up the album, in terms of flow and since the music is already not great, the overall experience feels like you're listening to someone's time with their kid, and you're paying for it...But, on it's own, the music still does not reach the power and variety that the first two albums did, or the albums prior to this."
2,Green fuzz all over - Green fabric is terrible and doesn't hold up,This product does help keep the moisture from the floor but not 100% and the green fabric is terrible. It ball's up like and old sweater and this happened before it went through the washer. There are pieces of it everywhere. I don't think it's worth the money.
2,Worked Great... At first,"I bought two of these for a litter of German Shepherd puppies. My female had a very small litter, only two pups. I loved the whelping box liner in the beginning. It worked great! It was easy to use and washed like a charm. What was even better is that it was extremely easy to keep the box clean, and the puppies were able to move around easily. The bad thing about these liners is that even though they say they're machine washable, they really don't do well in the wash... After about 10 washes, the back of the liners started peeling and coming off. Whenever the puppies peed it would soak through to box, and even onto my carpet (as I moved them out of the box once they were older). I am extremely disappointed with these liners. They've very expensive for how poor quality they are. I wouldn't recommend getting these, unless you never put them in the washer (you can just hose them off instead, and that works great except for when you do winter puppies like I do)."
1,No fresh and dry!,"I'm not sure if my order is an isolated incident, I hope it is for other's sake. But I'm really disappointed, all 8 packs of cake I received have shelf life of 4 months but the cake is not fresh and very dry."
5,Excellent!,"I love this CD! RLB is my favorite of the North Mississippi blues players. Love the songs, the musicians are first rate, and the sound is excellent. If you like RL, you may also want to check out Robert Belfour's 'Pushin' My Luck'."
5,Just shut up and buy it!,"Powerfull, driving and gets under your skin. Buy it and play it loud.My favourite blues album in my collection."
4,"Ok, but I wish Father Barry dug a little deeper","With this book, Father Barry helped me to come to a deeper understanding of God. However, I feel that if this book was taken a step further it would have been a lot more worth the read."
1,It always registers 80 degrees,"I want this to tell the temperature in the attached garage. It arrived in 30 degree weather outside the house. read 80 degrees. I've had it inside at 70 degrees, at school. Always reads 80degrees F. Purchased it through Amazon. All I want is a thermometer that works."
4,great value,The first thermometer arrived broken. I contacted amazon through email and a second one was promptly mailed to me in perfect condition. @robably won't within-stand rough handling by kids. Hang up on the wall or handle by adults only.
2,Not great for kids.,Flimsy for classroom use. Capillary tube falls down so temperature reading becomes inaccurate. Numbers are large and easy to read.
2,Kate Capshaw's ranch boss role.,"Kate Capshaw can be so appealing, but not so much in this movie. Vince Vaughn is more than just the comedian, in this one."
1,Sickening,"Rarely do I read other reviews before I write my own. I want to focus on a careful expression of my thoughts before allowing the influence of the considered (and often excellent) opinion of others. But I just didn't care enough about this movie to try to think carefully and then express carefully. I wanted to dash off a review--and quickly check to see if others were also offended--to warn to avoid this film. So, first, these opinions from other reviewers:""Nagging and dragging"". . . Exactly!""Nauseating"". . . Exactly!It is sickening to see this level of cruelty and hatred in a film. Anything positive here--the fun and sexy relationships between the young couples, the camaraderie between workers, between drinkers, the attempts at compassion, at befriending--seems so shallow, so trite, so false. Anything evil here--the hatred of the mother, the sexual sin of the son--seems so real, so true. This is sickening stuff. This isn't a film; it is a pathology report."
3,For Vince Vaughn Fans,"A melodrama that must set a record for how many times the characters light cigarettes and sweat through their clothes. Vince Vaughn (an underrated and always interesting actor) gives another charismatic performance as a stranger who comes to a Southern town and stirs up the already disturbed locals. As you get toward the end, you can figure out what is going to happen, but the journey is bizarre enough to be interesting. For the female Vaughn fans, the steamy fully clothed ""romance"" scene between Vince and Ashley Judd's characters is worth the price of the video alone. Kate Capshaw's character is too over the top and there are some painfully obvious attempts at symbolism (bulls/steers). The DVD doesn't have anything extra on it."
4,interesting story,"this was different, i really enjoyed it. the story hada good twist to it. vince really looked great, he stilldoes for that matter"
3,Rated three stars,"Plot is good, but to me, it still needs more. I felt it is somehow shallow, though I liked many simbolic scenes."
5,One of Marty's Best,"Recorded in 1992, this one catches Marty and a stellar supporting cast of first call N.Y.C. musicians doing what they do best = swinging with glee on a bunch of pre-world war two numbers. Jazzology had thankfully started to record Marty and his small bands in state of the art studios where the magnificent sounds of the hot choruses and hotter solos could be captured for posterity. Marty Grosz collectors will all have this one. Shame on them if they don't. It's a dandy."
2,Sort of a let down...,"If you're expecting something like ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" out of this, you only sort of get it. Theres a masked killer murdering teens, but it doesn't have the actual fun of F13's or the scares of the ""Halloween"" series. For the most part, it's pretty boring, in the same way ""Prom Night"" was, but even more so. Theres a TON of boring build-up, with teens and teachers having conversations, and stuff. The kills are pretty lame, too. However, it's not completely bad. It's actually pretty well made, and the directing is pretty good. You also get to see some cool clothes and hair from the early 80's, which was very enjoyable for me. But, again, it's mostly a snoozer, but it really doesn't deserve less than two stars. I sort-of reccomend it..."
3,good movie...,"This is one movie that I'm glad I have in my collection. If you liked PROM NIGHT, and TERROR TRAIN...you'll like this one alot. It's one of those campy, suspense, who dunnit slashers...great find!"
3,A Fatel Suspense,"Of all horrors Ive seen this movie keeps you thinking and guessing.To all cult fans if you remember the toxic advenger this movie is done by the same people that did graduation day. Like it is presented at the begining the track runner student freaklishly dies when she races the other team.Her sister comes to vist the town area and the school where she goes.By that moment wierd murders begin to happen one by one each student is disapearing. There is a gym teacher involved (Christopher George)actor.and a strange guy student involved who was a good friend to the girl. So this goes on it gets you thinking ,is it the gym teacher or is it the student. Imbetween the film by seeing every one students the principal who is a bit of character as well takes the audience us watching this film start to get a good idea who it is! Graduation Day is a film to see if you love to pin point the plot. I enjoyed it you may too!"
2,No Diploma for Graduation Day,"Ah the 80's. A good time for horror movie fans and CGI wasnt a factor in the movies, so everything looked real. This movie sounded like a winner. Of course, you'll never read a good synopsis followed by all in all this movie sucks. Troma owns this film and it fits them good. A track runner dies because well I never figured it out. The first kill takes awhile and the pace of the film is slow. The first kill was horrendous and it looked really cheap. There was only one real good kill and the rest of the film felt like it was too long and way to boring. If you like 80's film then maybe check it out but there is much better themed day horror films out there."
1,A rip-off of Friday the 13th and Halloween,"This is your typical slasher flick with bad special effects and bad acting. A killer is killing students before their graduation and kills them with a machete,knife,sword,and a football. The plot is a rip-off of other better horror movies and the characters look like their 29 instead of 19. Please don't watch this junk and rent a better slasher flick. The only good part was when the teen asks for his football back and the killer attaches a sword to the football and stabs him through the stomach."
3,Graduation day,Well what can I say. It's probably more funny then scary. This 1981 slasher movie made a ton of money at its release years ago. Just one to have in the horror dvd collection. The clothes and teaching staff will make you laugh.
3,Um..Well...You Decide,"I was very excited to purchase graduation day, as I have not seen it in years since I was a kid. After watching it, well, I guess I never really thought much of the film since it was a slasher film. Now that I'm older, watching the film, I was a bit disappointed. While the film makes a attempt to become a great slasher flick, the technical aspects of the film fall flat on its face. The movie is cheaply made. Yes I know that all early 80s slasher films are this way, but this one is REALLY cheap! The plot is interesting, but in terms of who would like this film, well thats hard for me to decide. I feel you REALLY have to be an avid 80s slasher collector to enjoy this film. The general public will find this movie to be a joke!"
1,One of the worst slashers I've seen,"This is about some high school track team members who start turning up dead. As far as ""atmosphere"" goes, it's much more of a '70s movie than an '80s one. The characters range from banal to absolutely detestable. The pace is plodding. There's basically no plot at all, even by slasher standards. A little T&A;, which just makes you notice how poor the picture quality is. The soundtrack is a joke, it actually sounds like you're listening to an old album. There's hum throughout, and snaps and pops all over the place.There are a couple of interesting scenes, but that's about it. I was really looking forward to this movie, I mean, an '80s slasher with girls on the track team. But it took me three tries before I even finished watching it."
2,Okay....and thats about it.,"This case turns one of the best looking phones on the market into an ugly duckling. It does however cover the phone in a manner in which it will not be scratched. The case also is very tight, and hard to put on at first. The clip leaves a lot to be desired, make sure you wait for the actual ""click"" when you strap on your phone or it is not attached!!!!!! The case does the job, and thats about it. Not a pretty display of the phone."
1,Read additional reviews. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.,"Hard to fit on the phone. You cannot take pictures with cover on. Outside screen is not covered, so it will be the first part of the phone to get scratched. After only one month of use, the leather covering the clip-on insert in the back of the phone broke... because of the weight of the phone! (that's how flimsy it is); so I am unable to use the belt clip at all. Finally, the stitches are falling apart in two places. I bought two of these cases and both are having the same problem. Read other reviews in the internet and decide for yourself. Absolutely not recommended."
1,motorola razor v3 phone/case,I recently purchased the motorola case with clip and the top piece does'nt fit but the bottom part does so I was not happy with the purchase at all.
1,Not as shown,"Customer photo shows flat, leather-covered clip. Item actually has a clip thicker than the phone itself. It's useless to me. I bought it because of the flat clip."
2,Design is too tight,"This design is in deed too tight for the phone. It covers the ""side"" buttons of the RAZR V3. I had to be inventive and use a marker to mark where the holes on the plastic coverings should have been and use nail clippers to make the holes. Otherwise these buttons are simanteoulsy pushed down. Also I think the plastic converings should have covering all the buttons on top instead of 3/4 of it. Look at the images they provide- I would still buy it & make holes yourself."
4,Review of RAZR V3 Leather Case with Clip,"I am pleased with the product, packaging, and shipping. I would have preferred more detail on the receipt for company records."
2,Motorola V3 Leather Case,"I am very unhappy with this holster. It was extremely difficult to get it off your belt when you received a call and after one month, it has now broken. Never again! Poor product!"
3,It a good case to protect your phone!,The Motorola Leather Case with Clip for the RAZR V3 is a good case for you RAZR V3 phone. If you not worried about trying to feel the keys on your phone to dale a number then this is good choice. The case covers the keys and screen with clear plastic.
1,Can you hurt my ear now??,The case was very hard to put on and the clear plastic on the phone had split. The speaker for the phone was covered up because it would not slide up enough for the opening and could hardly hear when talking. The plastic was very rough and hurt holding it over your ear when talking. I threw the case away approx. a day and half of using.
1,Cheap.....Not worthless but fits poorly,I owned the previous version of this product which performed well but wore out. When I went to replace it they made changes to the product that no longer worked with the phone and fit poorly holes for buttons were place incorrectly and just didn't work the same. I'll try something different.
3,Poorly made,The belt clip is poorly made. Very difficult to remove the phone when a call comes in. I would have returned this but don't want the hassle.
2,Must be a better case somewhere?,"The phone is hard to get out when you need to answer it. The plastic clip was hard to release when you wanted it to, and at other times it will jump off your belt for no reason. This is a good case if you have a blurtooth headset. The plastic clip just broke this week. I wanted a better case anyway. Try to find the right case the first time."
1,Don't buy this,"The main problem with the case is the belt clip. Rightly it can be removed, but it leaves a big button on the back that you can do nothing about. If you buy this case you double the thickness of the phone!"
1,this cover sucks,I waited patiently for more than 2 weeks to get this cover and it turned out to be an absolute disappointment. It is very very tight and you might end up scratching your phone urself and damaging it while trying to slip it on. It looks great in photo but is not in reality. Its a damn disappointment that the most popular phone in US does not have a great cover available anywhere.
2,Topless works best,"So, I agree with most of the negative comments regarding the case. I also think that there is a way to salvage your investment. The bottom covers most of the important parts and does support a clip which allows you to keep the phone on your belt while using all of the cool bluetooth features. Topless does let the 'ex-appeal' of your phone show itself. It really is a beautiful electronic device!If the case were designed to cover all of the bottom then it would work for me in my fast-n-furious not to be bothered world."
3,Good product but I dislike because of personal preferences.,I don't use it much because it makes the phone big and heavy! I love the lightweight of the Razr so this case makes it less likeable. This is only my personal preference so many of you may actually like it. I used it only for the first week and then just put it aside.
1,leather case with clip for razr V3,The clear plastic screen cover slides up over the ear piece when opened.Can't hear caller.Trash canned case ! pressey
3,motorola leather case with clip,The motorola leather case with clip was loose by the clip area. I had to use super glue to attach it so that it would stay firm. Other than that it works. Especially since it is not loose anymore.
2,The Design Critic,"Clumsy design. The upper part of the case is too tight which causes it to depress the side buttons. Also, holes for one of the side buttons are put in the wrong place and miss their mark."
1,Very bad,The item has been sent to a wrong shipping address. I have sent an email asking to send it to the correct address. It has been 2 weeks I have not yet received the item.
2,Pass it up,Bulky and obstructive to using phone features. Keeps making the voice controls turn on. Junk!
4,Moderate Quality Product,"This product was fairly good for the price, but the quality was somewhat dissapointing for the brand it was from, the plastic sticks to the screen, also fibers from the leather stick to the plastic, causeing it to make the screen fairly dirty. Also the plastic on the earpeice end hurts your ears after a while since its dully sharp."
1,Doesn't fit well,"I just got this in the mail. I put it on, and the phone won't close completely. I deliberately bought the Motorola brand case, figuring it would be higher quality and fit right for their own phone. I am extremely disappointed with both the quality and the fit. If it fit right I wouldn't complain (considering I got it for $7), but it doesn't. I have no choice but to return it."
2,Motorola Leather Case for V3,"Theres not much to say about this case. When you open the phone to take a picture the case gets in the way, the case is poorly made, mine ripped the first time I used it. Sorry but this case just wasnt good enough to use."
1,Too small,"Can't slip this on, made too small. Not worth returning as shipping is half the cost. It is well made but just too tight to use."
2,cekk phone cover,Very hard to put phone into case then when wearing the clip easy for the case to fall off. Not Sturdy
5,Absolutely Fantastic Fishing Rod,I got this rod about 5 months ago and fishing as been great ever since. It has good action and is very sensitive to even the smallest fish bites. It has held up perfectly against some larger 5 and 6 pounders. All in all a very good buy.
4,Life Viewed from a Different Angle,"I recommend *Twilight of the Gods: Cinatis*. The book is like a fun-house mirror... approach with a sense of fun and curiousity, but be aware that some will see a reflection they don't like.The storyline and pacing are strong. It's mildly disappointing that the characters are allegorical (100% good or 100% bad... but nothing in-between).As of today, this book is the first of an as-yet incomplete series. More, please!"
2,Too hot and too many knobs for toasting,The outside of the oven gets too hot - and you have to make sure there is nothing in its vicinity - which is not practical unless u have this huge kitchen with tons of extra counter space. Also in order to do a simple task as toast you have to do about 5 steps instead of the usual one button push... and even then u may have to repeat the process or end up with burnt toast.
3,Good Oven - Lousy toaster,"Dont like the toaster function. Sometimes great sometimes poorOven has worked flawlessly, frozen pies et al."
1,why is this company allowed to sell ANYTHING?,"Oster sunbeam is a brand that should be put out of its misery. A few years ago we purchased a lawn furniture set that collapsed just months later. I complained, and as compensation they sent me a food processing unit. That didn't work even for the most basic functions. So both are in the local landfill. This weekend my sister gave us a gift of the 6 piece toaster oven, from Lowe's. She thought the design would fit in with our retro kitchen. We plugged it in and within seconds my husband raised a blister touching the side of the EXTERIOR.You could have broiled chops on high, on that surface!So,don't fall for the design, but consider the safety of your family and your household contents. Lowe's should know better too."
1,cut hand on broiler pan,"Problems -1. very sharp holes on broiler pan - sliced my thumb up badly2. brief, inadequate users manual3. door doesn't stay open at one inch increment for broiling as directions indicate4. racks hard to manuever5. plastic melting smell6. toast takes 4 minutes +7. Only used it for a fews days - so no more complaints!Pluses1. removable crumb tray"
1,Dangerous!,Do not purchase this item! I have 3 burn marks on my hand from this toaster oven and it gets so hot you have to make sure NOTHING is in the way of it. I called Oster about this and they will not do ANYTHING for you. Thank goodness target does!
1,FIRE HAZARD!! Actual flames...DO NOT BUY THIS. S/B RECALLED,"Several people have already reported having experienced FIRE coming out of this toaster-oven. This happened to me when I was toasting two pieces of bread. Turned around to do something, while I waited two minutes, and I turned around to see FLAMES coming out of the toaster oven and the toast was literally TOAST. If there had been curtains around they would have caught fire. I don't know how I managed to extinguish it, but OMG DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
4,Cook Book for Broiler,I would like a cookbook to tell me how many minutes to do pork chops and other meats. The book that came with the Toaster/Broiler doesn't tell you anything about this. Please let me know who has a book I can purchase for this information.
4,Instructions for Toasting,"This is the largest capacity toaster oven I've seen in this price range, which greatly increases its versatility; it also has two shelves that can be arranged in different ways. So far, the one thing I do not like about it is that ""on"" and ""off"" are controlled through the timer. Not only is this a somewhat confusing extra step, but timers are notorious for being the first thing to wear out. Whether this is a problem or not remains (at least a decade, I hope) to be seen. Another reviewer lacked an instruction book and asked for the directions for toasting. For most toasting, use the bottom rack in the ""up"" position. Turn the temperature control knob to ""Max."" Turn the function selector knob to ""Toast."" (Both the top and bottom heater elements will operate.) Turn the timer knob past 15 minutes and return it to the desired setting (for bread, I'd recommend starting with no more than 2-4 minutes and taking it from there)."
3,Looks great..but too complicated,"I find that this toaster oven is to complicated. You have to leave it on max and work everything through the timer. Then to toast you have to turn past 15 minutes, and back to the desireddoneness. I also don't like the fact that the outside gets very very hot."
1,Burns me...,"This Oster product is a big disappointment. Though the oven looks nice, it's quality leaves a lot to be desired. First, it gets very hot on the exterior and the handle on the front is too small and mounted close to the glass - I'm always burning my fingers. Secondly, the unit does not heat evenly. Items placed in the back are more well done then those in the front. But in any case, whatever is placed inside will get burnt! It loves to make bread into hockey pucks! The multiple knobs - a joke. I got burnt when I purchased this item - don't make the same mistake!"
3,Super Size,"I love using toaster ovens and when the one I had for tenyears broke I thought this one would be nice. It is veryspacious which is great for the amount of baking/cookingI do in it. The toaster aspect is pretty bad. It takes atleast 10 minutes to toast some bread, and like anotherhad said, you have to babysit the oven. The knobs aretoo confussing and you need to use all three of them nomatter what you are making, even for toasting bread. Ithink they could have simpified this feature."
3,Cute but flimsy,"Adorable design that made a good gift for my daughter, but the watch band is falling apart after 6 months of wear."
5,Vivid and Entertaining,"Four women enjoy a new-found friendship and the beginning of an adventure. But a man enters the picture, and the majestic surroundings lose their significance for some of the participants, as Laurie learns first hand when her innocent friendly gesture is misinterpreted and the harmony of female camaraderie crumbles. Astounded, Laurie finds herself accused in rivalry that she has no part of. For me, the complex and emotional relationships and the vivid images of the canyon made ""Side Canyons"" a delightful reading."
1,If You Have a Brain Don't Bother With This Movie!,"This movie is so poorly written (trite, trite, trite) and badly directed as to be almost laughable and all but unwatchable. And the insanity of casting Jennifer Lopez as a ""blonde American who doesn't speak Spanish!"" A waste of any thinking person's time and money."
5,One of the best !!!!,"A very disturbing movie that we all should take our time to watch.Outstanding acting and a story that we all should stop in front off and appreciate how luck we are that we leave in countries there we can take the ""bad guys"" to justices. There is so many countries where women are not protected in the society and this movie only shows as one country.Very strong movie that should touch us all at heart, man and woman."
3,Interesting Topic,"This movie only touches the deep-rooted problem in Mexico, that Mexicans find unpleasent to admit. Martin Sheen was not the best choice as the Editor of the Newspaper that allows the Hispanic Female Reporter to go to a Bordertown in Mexico to look into the Rape and brutal Murders, and Kidnappings of young female Hispanic Factory workers. The topic is never discussed by Hispanics in America. Few seem to be concerned. But in Mexican Border towns, hundreds upon hundreds (possibly over a thousand) of these young female factory workers either disappear, or turn up raped or tortured, or brutally murdered. This movie attempts to bring this taboo topic to the attention of America. This movie is Loosely based on actual events in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico. Another Movie called Juarez, is a poorly acted action drama cashing in on this dilemma, with a very substandard attempt to exploit the situation with a very badly acted movie. Avoid that one. I didn't, and it really stinks."
1,a rant,"I know this film is in service of a cause, based on true-life events that are horrific in the extreme. It's still a rant, and it goes on for far too long."
4,Exposing the Murders of Juarez,"BordertownI think this movie was great, if not for anything else but to expose the activities taking place in Juarez. I am sure that Juarez has a lot more to offer than the murderous ways it has become known for, but so many people are unaware of the goings on there and I was so excited to know that a movie was going to be released. Rather disappointed it went directly to DVD but like most movies with JLo as a main character they tend to not do very well at the box office. I liked her in this movie and she is not completely hopeless as an actress either. I think some tend to forget her phenomenal portrayal of Selena amongst other roles. I think she's an easy target because she's JLo. But this movie was good, informative, and an action packed eye opener."
5,Heavy build and adjustable,While it would not fit in my Kubota RTV 400 due to room I found that due to its ability to mount in many configurations it was easy to relocate to the bed and still be very accessabil.
4,Kolpin Gun Mount,"The Kolpin 20073 UTV Gun mount was used in my 2012 825i J.D.Gator, it works great, But I did have to make a plate to go over the top of the consol, and mounted the gun mount to it."
4,koplin gun mount,the gun mount holds the guns nicely but i had to build a bracket from the gun mount to my seat on my polaris side by side to brace it to make the gun mount more solid with out it it wobbled to much and it might start cracking the plastic floor boards
1,bad,This book is horrible. The action is laughable.The main characters are portrayed as near supermen. David Robbins must be stupid.
5,Two fun books in one.,"Once again the reviewer from New York has attackeda Robbins novel with a simplistic insult.The truth of the matter is that these two books are much more than the sum of their parts. Yes, there is plenty of action, and yes, as always, there is plenty of humor, and yes, as always, plenty of suspense. But both are some more. MEMPHIS RUN, for instance, is a scathingly humorous dig at 'Elvismania'.As with most of Mr. Robbins books, you have to look a little deeper than the print on the page to fully appreciate his wit and insights."
5,AquaJogger Deltabell - Blue - Medium Resistance,I use this product with the Aqua Jogger three times per week for one hour in our community pool. I highly recommend it if anyone wants to get an all-around great workout.
3,Aqua Jogger Active Bells,Information was not complete as to the sizes of the Aqua Jogger Active Bells. I would have liked to know how the different sizes performed. I got a small size which is less than adequate for the use I give them.
5,Love this product,I love these dumbells. They create nice resistance in the water and make your aerobic workout that much more effective. I have used them at our area aquatic center and decided to give them a try at our lake. They really work great at working the upper torso. I highly recommend them for anyone just starting out. I am thinking of ordering the next larger size to add even more to my workout.
1,It gets deformed shape after few uses.,"It arrived on time, looked like to be firm,but after a few uses in the pool,the short edges started to loose shape & became deformed.Is it too late to return it to AMAZON.COM?I did not try to find out,for up till now,the deformation did not make a big difference with how it performs.The bottom line is DO NOT BUY.I do not know if there are another factory that makes such unitswhich will keep its shape intact for as long as it is used."
4,"Good protection, and cheap!","I picked up the three pack of these skins to protect my 60GB 5G iPod, and am very happy with them. they fit well and install easily. The only very small gripe I have is that there is no opening for a dock connection. You have to peel the skin back to get to that connection. This could be a plus if you're looking to protect that opening, but it was too inconvenient for me. I fixed the problem in 5 seconds with a sharp knife. Otherwise, no complaints."
3,Porsche Cayman Thrill of the Chase,"A good book on the development of the Porsche Cayman. Plenty of information and good photos. I would have preferred a simple statement of the history/facts instead of the use of this weak ""animal hunting"" metaphor throughout... it was so poorly done it detracted from the real information contained within. Its about the only book available on the Cayman, compared to the multitude out there on the 911, so you're stuck with this for now.rgr"
2,"Ratings are like opinions, everybody has one :)","Did anyone use this before reviewing it? It is fairly good for doing onions, tomatoes, celery and such. For meats, cheese, nuts and other stuff, it stinks! Clean up involves messing with difficult to reach places (like the hopper). I prefer something to be much simpler, I want to save time not waste more. I'd rather use a chopping knife than this thing. For my money, the Black & Decker mini is much better for the same price, or even less.This micro food processor looks a bit like the big ones, but its always a kitchen event to break out a processor. You know its time to prepare a big meal, or some special dish. For that you need a big food processor. Choppers are something you want to use, rinse off and put back on the shelf. When it works, the direct to the bowl feature is nice, but you still have to clean up after."
3,Not dishwasher safe.,"This is a good little food processor and I was very pleased with the shortcut attachment. Unfortunately, one trip to the dishwasher warped the plastic and now it is unusable. I would recommend this product if you don't mind washing it by hand, which I would have been willing to do if only I'd known."
2,Pain in my ***!,"Usually, I reach for my knife when it comes to chopping. However, there are some jobs that's just much easier from a food processor.So I ditch my little food processor that I got (...), butlasted 3 years and got this one...seems bigger and have more features(...).1. Sure..everything can go into the dish washer...all 5 or 6 parts...just make everything so over complicated.2. The food chute doesn't really work that well..you always got stuff fell into the bottom...more stuff to clean!3. The worse thing is the blade - the blade is flat, which works for the chute...but when you need to use it as a traditional food processor, it simply lacks the vertical torque to move stuff around. Just the other day I have to ""shake"" my hummus like a jingle bill so that it will mix properly.I had enough of this, and decided to spend more money on a kitchen aid or cusine cart instead... Of coures, when I come across this product - just to have to give you my 2 cents"
5,Love this thing!,"This is my best kitchen appliance. I'm now cooking things that I avoided because they called for too much chopping, slicing, and dicing. I don't understand the one person's negative review. Hello! It only costs 19.99, what did you expect? Plus, everything can go into the dishwasher! Love it, and you will too."
2,Disappointed,"First off let me say I love Bill Moyers. It is because of that fact and the positive reviews that I bought this video. Unfortunately I have say that I am disappointed. It is an informational video to be sure, but it is quite dated(1990). So much so that it took away from my viewing enjoyment. I think the fact that it was advertised as a 2008 video set up the disappointment. Be warned this is a 1990 video, not 2008."
4,A Classic Film of a Classic Play,"I show this film to high school students and after they get past the relatively crude production values, English subtitles and strange music, they begin to sense the power of the story. The intensity of the characters becomes almost hypnotic and the fact that this is a really old film becomes unimportant. My only regret is the story is closer to the Sophocles/Aeschylus versions that show the traditional endorsement of revenge killings. The revolutionary antiestablishment undertone of the Euripides text is ignored despite the fact that it raises timeless questions these actors could have explored to great effect."
5,Old Thunder - Evangelical Catholicism,"For Catholic Converts, ""Old Thunder"" is a must read. I am certain it is not the most well researched nor scholarly work on Belloc or the period of Catholic literary rennasaince. But as an introduction to the period and the players it is an excellent book.Historians and biographers such as Joseph Pearce seem to be held in low regard by their peers. Nonetheless, in bringing charaters such as Belloc to the less well read they are invaluable.The value of this book is also multiplied by Mr. Pearce's prose. Few writers of non-fiction are so preasurable to read. Old Thunder is an extraordinary biography."
4,Dance Along,"I put this on when a friend was here and we were dancing and having a great time with each song that came up. I'm 56 and I felt like a kid again. There's the twist, the bunny hop, a great polka,the jitterbug and more. Personally, I was pleased that the songs were NOT sung by Disney characters....although the cover to the CD alludes to that. There are just a few quacks from Donald Duck and a tiny bit from Goofy and Mickey, just enough to flavor it. I can see it being fun for all ages. I use many songs with Dancing Hands hand taps, a fun percussion instrument that sounds like tap dancing."
5,Uplifting and Comforting,"This isn't meant to be an intellectual book. You can be an intellectual, come from an intellectual church background, and still appreciate this book. Sometimes you need a simple to the point message, to be encouraged, and to be refreshed. This book offers just that."
4,Excellent resource,"Despite a multitude of typos, some of which made for a comical read, this book was refreshing and challenging. In typical Joyce fashion, the author takes the reader on a journey through the key Scriptures on the subject of prayer, lifting the spirit and encouraging the Christian to pray in faith."
5,Old Time Physical Culture Still Completely Usable Today,"I have read several written works of Eugen Sandow( 1867-1925 ) and I must admit that his physical culture is rather usable still today. The first part of this book is dedicated to descripe the story of Sandow and only at second part the book is conserning the physical culture as such.This work contains anatomy, with details of anterior and posterior aspects of body and it's muscles. I consern this very important for phyical culturist or body builder alike. The book then proceeds to give some 46 different excersises with bodyweight, dumbbells and heavy weights that are completely usable today and I've taken various exercises to my own programs. I would like to recommend this very warmly."
3,A bit too biased,"This audiobook was well written and interesting. However, the book is extremely biased theologically, and really doesn't paint an accurate picture of Spurgeon's beliefs. Kathy Triggs clearly doesn't agree with Spurgeon theologically, and that shows quite clearly in the almost complete omission of Spurgeon's theological views. She attempts to paint Spurgeon as a proponent of ecumenism.In the last part of the book, she also openly advises the reader to ignore the views of the older Spurgeon, and focus on the views of the middle aged Spurgeon. I really cannot recommend this book because of the serious bias."
4,Nice Lamp,We ordered two of these for a guest bedroomand they are nice clean looking and pretty wellmade. Simple assembly was needed by it only tooka minute or two.
5,Great Lamp!,"I've received a lot of compliments on this lamp - it's great looking and does not look cheap. Although it takes a 3 way 150 watt bulb, the shade cuts a lot of the brightness, but otherwise, I don't regret my decision to buy this lamp."
5,cancer,Quite helpful on the subject. One of his better books as some of the are just to sell his products.
2,Is That All There Is?,"THE BOOK ALLEGEDLY won the award for best Australian book of 1991-it must have been a slow year... No matter how you try and dress it up with meaning and hyperbole, this is a book about an unemployed slacker having lots and lots of graphic loveless sex and getting drunk/high a lot. It gets pretty old pretty quick, and there's little to take from it. The subject of lost youth in the modern world has been vividly and effectively portrayed in Scotland by writers like Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner, and in England and America in countless novels, McGahan seems to be striving for the same effect here, but it's not nearly as well written or interesting. The loser slacker protagonist (Gordon) is introduced in 1988, which has a lot less sex, and is slightly more interesting as a whole."
4,You need a shower after reading this book...,"Has to be one of the more important pieces of Australian literature of the last ten years. McGahan's simple, but gripping prose sets the scene of a place where people have no dreams to realise, where sex,alcohol,drugs and cigarettes are thrown in together to create a recipe of despair, sadness, humor and loss. Definetely not for the faint hearted, this is unputdownable. A modern masterpiece."
3,"A fine product, I assume","I do not have an opinion of the product, but the bottle it should not have arrived open as it did."
1,Dreadful,Because there are so many established quality travel guides that serve as models I was disappointed when I received and read through this guide. As the most current guide available I expected it to be top-rate. It's utterly worthless. The maps are illegible and the information is presented and written poorly. One's curiosity would be better piqued by reading instructions on how to assemble an IKEA bookcase.
5,Great Book,"Simple, clever, elegant solutions. This book is a nice short read (I took my time and read it in less than a weekend). Reader should be reasonably versed in the topic. It's not for absolute beginners. But there's no rocket science here either. Many of the concepts are familiar. It's all sound advice assembled in a smart sequence. Stands as a classic on it's own. Also makes an excellent follow up or compliment to Cederholm's ""Web Standards Solutions."" The Author's style is conversational, pleasant and never condescending. Very well done."
4,For web standards professionals to improve their skills.,"If you're a frontend engineer who's already skilled in web standards (semantic markup, CSS presentation, unobtrusive javascript), this book may help you to the next level. If you're new to that stuff, then I recommend Head First HTML With CSS and XHTML."
5,New perspective on web design,"I really like this book. It makes me totally convinced that I should use ""bulletproof design"" for my future work. The book does not teach the basic CSS and XHTML. However, you will get the inspiration to develop your skills after reading the very good examples, explanations and suggestions. It is also possible to use the solutions right away to improve your design. I recommend this book for those who wish to reach a professional web design level. Some of those who make their living as professional web designers would also benefit from reading this book."
2,Beware - You need to ALSO know Photoshop,"I was disappointed - not because the CSS stuff is poorly presented, because it's on the better side of average, but because to learn this book's stuff, or try to emulate some of the examples, requires a knowledege of Photoshop. For example, you need to know how to create an image with a gradient applied to a canvas, or to create a 1 pixel transparent row within an image - something that your average person may takes weeks to learn on his own. Photoshop is not all that intuitive to just grab a copy and simply create an image that the author uses.And the author's website to support the book lacks the images we could use - just to get through with the book's examples.By the way, the images the author uses do not even specify their size, so even trying to recreate these images augments this inherent problem."
3,Handles CSS risks - But not deep enough,"I liked this book which helped me to understand the issues around rendering with stylesheets and XHTML. This is not helpful enough as the CSS and XHTML are rendered through JSPs and ASPs. The book falls short on explaining them and how these issues can be resolved at the web application level. If you are a JSP or J2EE developer involved with Web development, then you need to read ""Core Security Patterns by Christopher Steel"" that narrates the tricks, techniques and strategies for designing secure web applications."
5,A must-have book,"The book itself is a pleasure to look at and work with: it's nicely designed and in color. The examples are excellent, the writing is clear and enjoyable to read, and there are very few typos. Dan Cederholm demonstrates what excellent results a good designer can achieve when he or she is willing to master some code.This is not a book for absolute beginners, in my opinion. I think you'll get a lot more out of the tutorials in <cite>Bulletproof Web Design</cite> after you've worked through a basic book on CSS."
3,Pretty Good,"This book is great for those of you who have been learning and teaching yourself XHTML and CSS through experimentation and trial and error. It opens you eyes to concepts that many web developers ignore and clients don't even realize exist.It's sad how people just take websites for their face value and don't consider visitors who need to ""modify"" these websites (eg. make the text larger).This book shows you how to try your best to make the site functional for all types of users. However, it doesn't dive in the advanced territory. Andy Budd's CSS Mastery book would be a great next-book after this one."
4,Good book for beginners in HTML design,Just completed a few chapters of this book. The material is presented in a very easy to understand manner. A must have book for people who are beginners in HTML design.
4,Good INstructional Book,"This book addresses some aspects of web design that I had not previously considered. I liked the way in which the affect of each CSS change is illustrated, such that the reader can see the result when each CSS rule is applied, as opposed to simply showing the end result of applying a bunch of rules. I was able to glean a number of new ideas from reading this book and a better understanding of the construction of quality web pages."
5,Excellent resource!,I recommend this book to others frequently. The tutorials are easy to follow and cover a lot of everyday situations. Should be used in classrooms...
3,Recommended but...,"Most of the solutions are very good but the ""problems"" behind quite a few of these are non-existing or not important at the most.The rest of the subjects are OK and if you are prepared to skip about 1/3 of the book I can recommend it."
4,"Conceptos solidos, limpios y claros, aunque no muy tecnico.","El libro se enfoca más en conceptos aunque abstractos, importantes y bien ejemplificados sobre el porqué un diseño debe de ser a prueba de balas. El código es limpio, sencillo y dan la base a conceptos muy puntuales que son pilares para un desarrollo web portable, compatible y optimo. Sin embargo, no profundiza mucho sobre el CSS como lenguaje, y variaciones a algunos ejemplos presentados hacen que se deba buscar el porque de repente ya no funcionan. Lo recomiendo como un buen libro para formarse un criterio solido sobre diseño web."
4,The Best I've Seen Despite a Few Errors,"This guide contains a wealth of information not easy to find in other sources. It is good at providing historical individual stats, but particularly good at providing comprehensive historical TEAM stats, which I find surprisingly hard to come by. There are a few mistakes and a few stats that s/b added (like time of possession where available), but overall the best of its kind made. Too bad it appears to no longer be published annually. (Also, the cover of the last edition was thinner and less durable than in prior editions.)"
1,land of a thousand boo-boos,"in the mid-90s i bought this book.... i found over 600 mistakes, then quit... mistakes of every imaginable type.... and these were internal mistakes, where the same information in the book was different in 2 different places... especially bad were the all-time and single season category listings in the back.. i wonder if things have improved?...---stolf---"
4,What a find!,"Fantastic! I bought 2... one for myself and another for a friend - you always need a practice partner when you decide to start learning a new language! What a hoot! Has great words, expressions and a section on the correct pronunciation of each 'letter'. Also includes a section on syntax and grammar. More than just a 'dictionary'!!"
2,"Interesting, but not what I thought it was","I bought it after learning about the author's work with constructing this artificial language and as a fan of Star Trek. The words given are often esoteric, and I was looking for more of something like a ""Spanish - English dictionary"". I will have to check out the ""Klingon for the Galactic Traveler"" for that I guess."
1,I have this book but....,"I am a Star Trek TNG fan, loved DS9 but pass on Classic and Voyager. I have a copy of this book which I love to show off and I won't stop you if you want to buy it. But... here are some of my thoughts. You learn Klingon you can only talk to other Trekkers, you learn Spanish, French or Japanese and the world will be yours. It automatically gives you a few thousand bucks extra in your monthly paycheck, it will get you more callbacks if you put it in your resume. You will open yourself to more people and you will never get lost in Europe. If you speak Japanese you are guaranteed a job in JFK's Airport... guaranteed.I love Star Trek... a lot... but I am a realist in this planet.Thank you."
1,Extreme deviation from the series,"The author is a professional linguist, and as such he thinks he knows better than the tv series. So he's totally recreated the Klingon language to fit what HE thinks it should be. No hard K's, they are a linguistic cliche, so we have all kinds of strange Q's being used, and linguistic revisionism to tell us that they really aren't called Klingons, etc. So for someone wanting a guide to the Klingon language as shown in the original (and best) series, this is an extreme disappointment. If you want to invent your own language, fine, but don't mess with someone else's creation if you don't respect it."
5,A Cool Reference To Have For Fans,"This is a really cool book if you want to know what certain words are in Klingon, but to actually learn the language, it will take a lot of time. This book goes into great detail about how to pronounce words and where they belong in a sentence. This is like learning any other language, and it won't be easy to learn, but it is still really fun to have and read. I'm trying to learn, but it will take a while."
5,Awesome book ever made!,"I just got this book as a christmas present. I think it's the best dictionary ever! I now know how to speak a few phrases in Klingon, but I'm still learning to speak more phrases of the language to myself. If you don't have this book, Get it now. It's the best book that'll help you learn the basics and all the grammar of the language of the Klingon Empire. I rate this book 5x2 stars. It's the best Klingon dictionary Okrand ever made! Buy it and you'll learn the greatest language of the Empire! Qapla'!"
5,A fun book!,"This was a great book for budding linguists! I was a linguistics major at university when I bought this, studying AI among other things. I attempted to get a course created that studied how a 'constructed' language like Klingon, (which a practicing linguist designed!) would work, and how it was designed. We had a professor interested, and at least a dozen senior students, but couldn't get the department head to sign off on the idea, (she was very conservative, and couldn't see the sense in studying a non-natural language, even if it was built using natural-language principals!) Too bad, though, as it could have been really interesting. Anyway, the book is well put together, and as I mentioned, the language was designed around sound linguistic principals as a potentially 'real' language."
1,morally disgusting,"Hi folks. My name is Jerem... eh.. John Doe. I'm a lousy backgammonplayer and a lousier writer. I have absolutely NOTHING to contributeto the backgammon community, but I'm vain and I want to be known inthe community. So I decided to ""write"" a book slashing at the great players of the past, you know, those guys that played backgammon using only their grey matter(I wonder where I can buy that) without any help from bots, which didn't even exist then. Of course, as I told you, I'm mediocre but I'm a Snowie lackey, so I'll put down everything my master tells me to. So buy my book, ok? Go ahead, make my day!"
4,Fun game for young kids,"This may never go down in history as a great game, but my 7 year old loves it. I was hesitant to buy this game with some not so great reviews, but I am glad I did. It is just the right mix of fun and challenge to keep him entertained, but not overwhelm him with difficult levels. He has managed to play this game through by himself for the most part with some occasional adult help. The game is not scary or violent or have a lot of complicated jumps and such. So it does not overwhelm young players. It has fun candy powers that my son really enjoys and it gives him a chance dwell in the fantasy."
1,Cheaply Made! Incomplete Product Received!,"This product is very cheaply made! First of all the finish of the product that I received was nothing like that in the picture. I also did not receive all of the screws to put it together, either. I am sending it back tomorrow. Unfortunately, I have to pay for the return shipping and am also subject to a restocking fee as well. Since the error is on the seller's end, I do not feel that I should be responsible for either of these costs. I will definitely not order from this seller again."
2,did not work,"the product came a tad bit slow and when i received it , my battery would not charge , smhh"
3,doesn't work like new,"I purchased this product as a ""New"" item. It looks new but compared to my last one that I lost, this item does not keep the battery charged as long as the last one. The old one was 12 months old and in my opinon worked better. But this charger does work."
5,One of Cassie's best. I couldn't put it down.,"Storm's Angel is probably one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The story not only keeps you interested, it also pulls at your heart strings. Tanzy is so wild spirited, you wonder if Rolling Thunder will ever be able to tame her. I've read many of Cassie's books, she really knows how to hold the reader's attention."
1,Bad . . . plot! Cartoonish . . . characters!,"Tanzey Nicole is the . . . spunky heroine of this laughable and silly Indian romance! Her twin brother has . . . vanished and she's . . . looking for him and suddenly she . . . sees a handsome Comanche Indian!She follows him hoping he will . . . lead her to her brother and he . . . takes her captive!Boring, badly written and plotted, this book's sole purpose is to show people how not to write."
5,Great deal on a very useful clamp set,I got a couple of these sets to use as a clamping platform and they do that perfectly. The sets can be split into two clamps each for when you need individual cutting guides. They clamp very tightly and do not deflect.
2,You are buying only one set of clamps,"Even though the picture shows two sets of clamps, you are actually buying only one set of clamps. This makes the cost of the full set of clamps very expensive. You can do better buying regular clamps from your local hardware store. Misleading Image."
2,Needs improvement,"Looks nice, protects the i860 very well. But... I've only had it for 3 months, the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used. The swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets. The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera, it has to be held down away from the lense. Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers."
3,attention,"did not really like this product, the case was a little bulky and did not fit the phone like a glove."
1,This Body Glove can easily cause loss of your $$ phone.,"Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril."
3,An early HDT picture book,"This small volume recounts a humorous story set down by Henry David Thoreau in his journal on March 19, 1856. Said to be true, it tells of a sequence of events that occur when people hurry about during spring thaw weather. Each simple black and white illustration by George Overlie is enhanced by a selected wash of blue. This nearly-square publication from the early 1970s is a far cry from the colorful oversized children's books that are common today. Still, some amusement can be found in the narrative and the accompanying scenes. The devoted fan might track down a used copy of this book to save as an example of an early attempt to make Thoreau's words accessible to young readers."
4,Its not the same in the picture,It more like plates not what you see.. But I still like and use so all is good great colors !!! That's a plus
1,horrible experience!,i had thee most worst experience with this purchase! it was for a job that i was unable to do due to getting the wrong item i purchased..which put me behind in bills since i was unable to work & no not a stripper job!! it was a concert event! and wasent happy at the fact that i have to pay the shipping to return the item!! im basically paying for someone elses mistake!!! very unfair!! i dont think i will purchase through amazon again!
3,sized wrong,The wall border was very nice. Looks great and came in a timely manner but 1 roll was 1/2 inch wider than the other roll so i had to adjust!!! Whats up with that????
2,"Rehashed and repackaged - Been there, done that!","If you own BH&G's Halloween, Halloween Fun or (especially) Halloween Pumpkins & Parties, you've already seen everything this book has to offer. The material is mostly rehashed from Pumpkins & Parties. If you don't already own the above, this is a great savings on buying three books. The only new material I could find was a section at the back that had some cute invitation ideas, but that doesn't make this worth the price tag. Since the other books had some clever ideas, I was looking forward to this one. What a disappointment!"
5,Crazy About this book,"Rebecca Ward's ""How to Stay Married Without Going Crazy"" is written with wry humor and infinite wisdom. It's an easy read, and chock full of solutions to most relationship problems. It's suitable for anyone from newlyweds to those with 50-year marriages to roommates. Everyone can benefit from Ms. Ward's humorous wisdom. If you're going to buy one book on relationships, buy this one. You'll be glad you did."
5,Awesome,"This book is very insightful and not watered down with a bunch of filler. It is a quick 1,2,3 of how to not only enhance your marriage but also your life. It does not just need to be read by people in struggling marriages but anyone that is married or contemplating marriage. I would make it a prenuptial requirement."
1,"Go to the Source, Dr. David Schnarch's Passionate Marriage","I think Ms. Ward would be an excellent therapist. She is deeply caring and undeniably well-intended, and certainly the principles in her book are far more sound than in most marital self-help books. But alas, she is not a good writer: not well-organized, not terribly clear, with some tendency to hop around. Few such books are written really well, but this is exceptionally clunky. Better go to the source: Dr. David Schnarch's extraordinary Passionate Marriage. She credits him in her acknowledgement (""After my first workshop with him in 1992 I felt like I needed to put a 'Closed for Remodeling' sign on my door."" ---but not, in my view, nearly enough. The concepts are his. Basically, this is a well-intended, less articulate, somewhat dumbed-down, short-course version of Passionate Marriage. I guess its hominess and lack of sophistication might appeal to some --- didn't do it much for me."
4,cheap and effective,"After looking at different models and recommendations online, I decided to go for this model, since it was cheap, attractive, and had a removable water reservoir. I was quite cautious when pouring into the reservoir, and pouring coffee out of the carafe since some people have complained about spillage. I'm pleased to say that I haven't spilled a single drop, and that I am very happy with my first coffee maker."
3,Not for the forgetful,"The size, look and price of this product are great. Its downfall is in the lack of an auotmatic shut-off timer. I am a teacher and I had to return this product because if I were to leave school in a rush or without carefully going through my room, it would be very easy for me to leave this coffee maker on all night. This is something that I could not risk nor would I want anyone else that is looking for a small, quality coffee maker for their dorm, office, apt, or small space."
3,Compare Krups with Mr. Coffee,"A co-worker had this Mr. Coffee machine. I was always mooching her coffee so I decided to buy my own. I went with the Krups 4 cup maker instead, mainly because it has a permanent filter and a wide water pour in, as well as a water gauge on the side (so you know how much to pour in). My co-worker was always complaining about the small paper filters being hard to find. The downside to the Krups is that there is no programmable timer (but I don't need one at work) and the coffee down't come out very hot. So, I just let it sit on the warmer for about 15 minutes before I drink it. It's the perfect temperature then...hot- but not hot enough to burn my tongue. I bought the Krups at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $20- same price as the Mr. Coffee. It comes in both white and black."
3,Awkward water fill,The water resovoir is not easy to remove and replace. A handle would make things much easier. Mr. Coffee has models that are better designed. It is too bad that Amazon did not choose to list them. I suspect that the listed coffee makers are discontinued models...and for good reason.
4,They don't make them like they used to...,"I bought this model as a replacement for an older Mister Coffee four cup model, and I was sorry I discarded the older machine, especially since the only thing wrong with it was the difficulty in cleaning the filter holder.The new model has a larger footprint for no apparent resaon but style. It has a more specialized carafe design which seems to be designed to prevent purchasing a generic replacement carafe. The new carafe drips water and the plastic lid is fastened to the handle. Very annoying.Compare this model with reviews of similar coffee makers before making a decision. It may not seem worth it for a less than $20 appliance, but the avoided aggrivation may make it so."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this coffee pot in Dec 2004. My biggest disappointment is the clock/timer which is extremely difficult to set. If others are having the same problem I doubt it is ever used - so why buy this model when there is another model without the clock that is cheaper. <br /><br />To set the clock you have to press and hold down the ""set"" button. Then at the same time you press the up or the down arrowed buttons and the time increases or decreases one minute for each press of the button. Notice you are already using two hands to set the clock.<br /><br />To increase the time involves going through this 60 times and if you want to change AM to PM it requires 720 presses. Remember you have to do this while continuing to press the Set button.<br /><br />Not user friendly at all!"
1,Very disappointing..especially in the morning,"Had this coffeemaker 2 weeks. This morning it decided to no longer work. Water stayed in the reservior and did not drip through. Even the first time I used it, it took FOREVER to brew a pot of coffee. Will not buy again."
1,Plastic odor when brewing,Do not even consider this lowest end proiduct. The plastic smell while brewing ruins the coffee drinking experience.
3,"What to do if you're happy with the coffee, but not with the decanter.","I wanted to point out that Mr. Coffee makes two 4-cup coffee makers. The one you're looking at is about $5 more than the other because it has a one hour auto-off, a clock and is programmable.The less expensive coffee maker lacks these features, but it's decanter is a great improvement.I suggest that if you are unhappy with the pouring portion of your current Mr. Coffee, you purchase a decanter for the cheaper 4-cup coffee maker (Model TF4). The two seem to be the exactly the same except for the techie additions on the programmable one listed here."
2,OK coffee maker,The tabs on the lid that connect it to the pot are cheap and break easily. The small pot is also hard to clean.
1,Quit working after four months,"I received the DR4 Mr. Coffee Four-Cup Coffeemaker as a gift this past summer and the other day, mid-through the cycle, it stopped working. The heat plate turned cold and the remaining water in the unit stayed in place. Contacting customer service three times led to not so much as a form letter, so I'm done with this brand. I don't recommend it."
3,NO WHITE !!!??,"DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ONLY BRAND OF COFFEMAKER WE BUY WAS N/A IN WHITE, SO WE BOUGHT BLACK WHICH MATCHES NOTHING ELSE IN OUR KITCHEN"
5,Mr. Coffee / Amazon.com a Perfect Blend,"My recent purchase of the Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Coffeemaker was a replacement gift for my roommate since I dropped her coffee pot by accident. Just the right amount of coffee for a few cups to get you going in the morning; easy to clean; takes up less room than my make-up mirror. But the best part was the transaction with Amazon.com. If I had more money I'd furnish my life through amazon.Every purchase I've ever made w/amazon had no hitches. I can take a look around the site and find some goodies, place them in ""my"" basket and leave them on hold there until I decide if I really want and/or need it. Mr. Coffee was a no brainer. I've used the line for years.amazon.com makes me feel like I found a really good product at an acceptable price.Thanks for asking."
1,would not recommend,"I purchased two of these coffee makers from Target and I'm returning the second one now. It seems that they are defective, the first one I purchased the clock didn't work. Now the second one worked two times and now it won't go on, so I'm returning this one. I've decided not to buy another one from Target."
4,affordable,"I bought this more than five years ago when I realized that rare coffee drinkers that we were, we were still spending money weekly at Starbucks. This machine experiences bursts of activity every few months. It is exactly as it is pictured and operation is intuitive. Fill the little pot with water, pour all the water into the grey plastic part (the plastic parts are what I don't like about this machine), put the coffee pot in its place after wiping off the exterior, lift the lid and place a paper filter in the top with coffee grounds, close the lid and flip the switch. The machine will gurgle gurgle for a few minutes and then there will be coffee. I guess the alternative to this would be the bodum FRENCH coffee presses or the stovetop Bialettis but this is cheaper, doesn't break and is very easy to clean. The other reviewers are exactly right about the drips and leaks. My biggest concern/misgiving is the plastic and so far my cheapness overrides health worries."
1,Leaks And No Customer Support,"We are on our second Mr. Coffee AR5 4-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, Black. Both leak water onto our counter. No reponses to my emails to Mr Coffee 'nonsupport'."
1,Poor design then poor customer relations!,I used this product less than a month when it began to clog up when brewing. After cleaning totally it continued to have this problem. I emailed Mr. Coffee asking for assistance. They responded by sending me the directions for cleaning that were included in the original brochure. I have just pitched this lousy product that I purchased because of its reputation. I hope this helps contribute to their demise!
1,pain relief,I really am not yet certain if this works for my pain as i am only using it a few weeks.So far the pain is still with me but i do have many progressive and chronic health conditions that cause great pain.I do know that it is not difficult to use and the taste is fine.I had taken capsules in the past and was hoping to use this as it is easier on the tummy!
4,Planning to Fight,"I knew War Plan Orange and the Rainbow plans existed, and they involved advancing into the Western Pacific. This book provides the details on the evolution of these plans. It also discusses the deviations from these plans during WWII to both defend and invade the Philippians and the Japanese home islands. The discussion of planing is interesting and the overview provides a good context for understanding Pacific strategy."
3,Boring...,I thought the bible was boring and tough to read...until I read this one. If you have ADD stay away from this book. It is an absolute snoozer. I am sure it has some great info somewhere in it but good luck staying awake long enough to pry it out.
2,Superseded by Later Works,This book is well illustrated but tries to cover too much in too little space. When such as Shelby Stanton (c.f.) devote whole books to the WW II clothing alone and others to individual equipment it is no longer needed.The publisher has realized this and has brought out a new three volume set in this series covering the same era. The publisher should simply let this one go out of print. Its day is past.
3,"Nice tent, good size, not very easy to set up","The tent is a good size, 7.5 X 7.5 with a square floor, allowing us to set up in smaller areas but have good space inside. Good ventilation from the Cyclone vents. The tent leaked moderately in a heavy downpour. I did not seal the seams before the trip. I'm one of those people that believe you shouldn't have to. I've had other tents that didn't leak a drop with any seam sealer applied but I will for this tent for future camps. The floor is made up of the regular tent material... nothing reinforced like in a lot of tents. Looks like it could tear or damage easily as it's really thin. I would recommend something to put underneath. The four poles to set up the tent wasn't a big deal to use but getting them through the actual pole sleeves proved frustrating, even after 6 setups.Overall though, I would buy this tent again. Slap on some seam sealer and buy a tent pad to protect the floor."
2,Bad design!,"When this tent arrived we immediately set it up in our living room. This was the most frustrating tent I have ever tried to set up, even with 2 people. There are twice as many poles as should be necessary, they are cheap/poor quality fiberglass, and they barely fit through the ""loops"" on the top of the tent. It took us about 30 minutes to set it up (without the rain fly) and about 5 minutes to decide to return it to Amazon. I would never want to experience that amount of frustration while on a vacation.We replaced it with a Mountain Hardwear Light Wave 3. The day the new tent arrived, my wife was able to set it up completely by herself in 4 minutes."
5,great summer home,"I really like the tent for extended periods of car camping. I use it as a single person tent when I am camping for at least a few days in one place. It is my sanctuary when camping with family. It fits back into the bag with ease, and has great storage pockets inside. It is heavy and has a lot of poles. The mesh is great, but I have the rainfly on it most of the time for modesty purposes. That seems to be the case with most tents this size though."
4,"Totally unique sound, I love the CD","I really love this CD, As a trumpet player myself, I just love the way he plays, he took a sound that most music teachers would tell you not to make on a trumpet, and made it musical. If you are into interesting music, this ones for you."
4,Pud in his element,"Long acquainted with the jazz clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Pud Brown, from his days with Pete Daily and Jack Teagarden, I was slightly disappointed with this CD, primarily with his selection of tunes. Opening with his signature number, ""Johnson Rag Blues"" (which is better on sax with Pete Daily) Pud includes some goodies, such as ""Sweet Georgia Brown"", ""Yellow Dog Blues"", ""Tin Roof Blues"", and ""Riverboat Shuffle"", however, some of the other songs are not up to his normal standards. Still, with the Daily and Teagarden sides rarely available, this surely gives the collector a sample of one of the best Dixieland reed men, with Ernie Carson on cornet, a genuine bonus."
2,Do not buy if you use a belt clip,"The case itself is excellent. It feels good and looks like it could withstand a pretty good drop. However, the belt clip is cheaply made. It sticks out about an inch in the back, and allows the ipod to swivel too easily. If you run, dont be surprised if the ipod starts doing 360s on your waist. I was wondering why I could not find any pictures of the belt clip on the web, and now I know why."
2,Where are the juicy details?,"I bought this book because I enjoy watching ""All in the Family"" reruns on TV Land. It's a great show. This book tells the history of how the show was formed, written and produced, but you don't hear from the actors themselves very much at all.I want to know how the four actors felts about these roles, about their day-to-day adventures while filming and how they felt about each other as professionals and individuals. This book didn't answer those questions."
2,Weak Overview of Historical Series That Lacks Original Research or New Information,"The author of this book merely went through some old magazine interviews and pieced together this book about All in the Family. The author also wrote books on ""The Honeymooners,"" so it's no surprise that throughout the book she compares All lin the Family with The Honeymooners, though she never really makes her case. Other than one chapter near the end that analyzes the controversy over the such, this ends up being an enlarged TV Guide-style article praising the series without going into any depth. It does have an episode guide but the books is just the minimal that could be written on the subject and just about anyone who watched the show could have done it as well as this author."
4,"A solid, musical singer backed up by a wonderful accompanist","The name of bass-baritone Roland Hermann was unknown to me, but my eye caught the name of Geoffrey Parsons as accompanist, and since he could have his pick of the best lieder singers up to his untimely death in 1995, I gave this CD a try. What a nice surprise -- Hermann possesses a solid, mature, traditional voice (i.e., a bit burly as befits a German singer who might undertake Alberich or Gunter), but more importantly he's very musical. There aren't many collections of Mahler's wonderful early songs this good; there's a stylistic, folkloric rightness about it -- we're out on the village green in jolly or melancholy mood -- in no small part thanks to Parsons, who also plays on Thomas Hampson's early Mahler recital (Teldec). Hermann isn't as urbane or charismatic as Hamapson, but he can sing Mahler, and that's what counts. Recommended to anyone who collects these songs or loves to hear them as often as possible."
5,This is Beautiful,"Yolanda Young has written a memoir that will make you laugh and cry and think. It took courage to write this book because it's not all sweetness and light. Her father nearly killed her mother. Her uncle was killed and another uncle committed an apalling crime. She's frank about these things and her family's experiences with racism and snobbery. On the lighter side, she's not ashamed to admit some of the foolish things she did as a girl. This book is filled with light and love. The words of her great-grandmother, Big Momma will stay with you for a long time.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men"
2,shipping review,"Shipping this little item has taken a long, long time. Now I wish I had gone to Wal-mart and picked it up."
3,"Not the best of this genre, but...","This book will captivate you, disgust you, and you will not be able to put it down. It was a bizarre expose on the effect of severely dysfunctional and perhaps mental illness in a family. I had many questions after reading, but I will not spoil anything for other readers. I will also say, the statements about Josie being the sane one...well...I beg to differ.A better book than this on all levels is Forbidden by Tabitha Sazuma. This book has also been compared to Flowers in the Attic ""FitA"" by VC Andrews, one of two she originally wrote before she died and her nephew and several ghost writers took over. It does not compare to FitA on a character development level or a level that truly shows the deep and abiding obsessive love that is trying to be portrayed.But, I read it all in one sitting, it was a page turner, and I kept wondering...did they...or didn't they?"
2,It was OK; 2 and a half star-style OK.,"There isn't really anything too exciting or intense about the first 220 pages of Josie and Jack. It's well written, it has likeable characters, and Josie as a narrator succeeds at explaining why her brother is the greatest thing since sliced bread. But as far as a plot is concerned, Josie and Jack doesn't have one. It's a slice of life coming of age tale that has a fantastic ending. Life for the characters don't really get any better. But they don't get worse. It just is. As a read, it's quick, and it's a page turner in that you want for something to happen. But there isn't anything too recommendable about this novel."
3,Kept on waiting for something,"I thought this novel was very well written and I was drawn in from the first page to the lives of Josie and Jack. There was implied incest but nothing ever developed. This was a page turner for the simple fact that I kept on waiting for the excitement and ""shock"" to start. Well it never did. I could have skipped to the last 10 pages of this book and been just as satisfied as reading every page."
3,good for its type,"A good to pretty good coming of age novel, sustained through its weak parts by the elusive, ever-present possibility of incest between the two principals - just enough to banish the banality that some of the set-piece scenes might otherwise create. If you are boarding an airplane, or looking for light engaging summer reading, buy this book."
5,absolutelyl fabulous,I just loved this book. This was an absolutely riveting story that I couldn't put down. The author's style was different from anything I've read but it was a well crafted book. I can't wait to read her latest novel. This is definitely worth the purchase price.
5,Workstation Holds A Lot,"I bought this to try to organize my electronics. I have a desktop and put an HP All-In-One scanner/printer in the well, which fits perfectly. The flat-screen monitor I have fights for space with the keyboard, but I usually take the kb into my lap anyway. It is very sturdy and goes together easily. My only problem with this item was the top shelf was misdrilled, so the last two screws couldn't go in. It works all right despite this. After 3 emails to VisionDecor, I finally got assurance that my replacement shelf is coming. Despite the shelf glitch, I give this item 5 stars because it works so well and is so sturdy."
1,Dangerous to CATS!!!!!!!,"Please, do not use this product!!!! I have to warn anybody who will listen... This product can be harmful if not fatal to cats! My cat died because of a very similar product. I want to warn everyone. Do not use Hartz drops either as they are just as dangerous! The only safe flea/tick medication is frontline advantage available from your vet. Yes, it is more expensive but isn't your pet's life worth it? Please believe me, I am not making this up or exaggerating! I lost my female cat and my male cat is still recovering from this poison. Please Please Please be safe and listen to my warning."
1,If I could give this negative stars I would,"This product is extremely dangerous and I will recommend NOT buying it to anyone who will listen. First of all, it does NOT help get rid of fleas whatsoever. Second of all, it is NOT good for cats (or dogs) and can actually kill them! We used this product on all three of our cats and one of them almost died. Yes, it is cheaper than other flea treatment products like Frontline and Advantage, but it will end up costing you more if you have to pay for one or more vet visits. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,VERY TOXIC,DO NOT buy this as it can cause death in cats and dogs. Unbelieveable that it's still on the market after so many cats and dogs have either died or had severe allergic reations. Unethical!!
1,DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!,"We just got a kitten for our kids for the holidays, and unfortunately she came with fleas. Even MORE unfortunately, I picked Hartz flea product to try to get rid of them. She managed to lick the drops off of the back of her neck, started throwing up within minutes and was dead within three days. We did take her to the vet and she spent two nights there with them giving her every medication they could think of to help her, but she still died. I'm not sure why this product is still on the shelves, but if you look online you can see that I am not the only one that has had this happen. Use Frontline or something recommended by your vet."
1,Does not work AT ALL,"I wish zero stars was an option.I bought this product at Walmart after finding fleas on our two cats. We applied one vial of treatment on each cat, quarantined them in separate rooms for four hours (so that they could not groom the product off of each other), and waited for the magic to happen! It didn't. We've been combing them with a flea comb daily, and the number of fleas found on each cat has gone UP in the ten days since we applied the treatment. We were using Hartz in tandem with diatomaceous earth on the carpet/sofas, apple cider vinegar on the hardwood, salt on the counters and tables, and daily vacuuming. We haven't found any fleas on ourselves/in the house since we started our aggressive battle, but we continue to find them on the cats. This proves to me that the fleas are living, laying, and hatching quite happily on our felines post-treatment. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."
1,doesn't work,We followed the directions exactly and used this product on our 2 cats at the same time. Week later they both had live fleas on them.
2,Too much liquid,We bought 3 boxes for our 3 cats. 2 long hairs and one short. The product seems to work except it leaves a large area of fur coated with the product. The area gathers dirt due to the coating. The product stays visible for 10-14 days on our cats.
1,beware,i put this on my cat 5 hours earlier. he has lost hugh clumps of fur. i bathed him immediately. never again will i use Hartz. i am in utter shock.
1,This stuff almost killed my cat!,"He came in from the back yard about 8 hours after application, panting, heart racing. I thought he was overheated and didn't put two and two together until the next day. The veterinarians staff said they have lost many, many cats to this product. I cannot believe it is still being manufactured and sold."
1,Did absolutely nothing!,"I bought two boxes of the 3 mo supply for my two cats. I have used it for two months and am extremely disappointed with the results. I used it precisely as the instructions on the box indicated, but I see no dead fleas or any less fleas on either of my cats after the two times I have applied the treatment. It almost seems as if there are more fleas than before I applied it. All that this product does is inconvenience me and make my cats uncomfortable for days because it leaves an oily spot on the back of their necks that doesnt dry for about a week! Don't waste your money on this product. Spend a little more on something that actually works- like Frontline or Revolution."
2,did not work,"My cats continued with fleas after using this product and when I told my vet which product I used she said "" Oh, just throw it out"". She knew this product has unsatisfactory results."
1,Should have negative 5 star rating!,This is the worse product ever! When I bought it I figured it was the same as what I get from my vet as I forgot the name but absolutely not! I put it on one of my 3 cats and she instantly starting itching the area and trying everything she could to get it off of her. She started running from me and was so obviously miserable. She was itching so bad her fur was getting scratched off. That was yesterday and I have washed the area 3 times now. It finally looks better but a small amount of residue is still on her. I feel so bad as she went through H*** and know now to just wait until a weekday and get these kinds of products from my trusty vet. The rest of it is in the garbage and believe this company should not be allowed to sell this poison. I've learned a lot and care about my pets too much to go the cheap route ever again.
1,do not like this product,"I used this on my cat just like the directions said. For 24 hours any time someone would touch the area that the flea medicine was distributed, she would freeze, then run under the bed. This product caused her to be very sensitive, and definetely not acting like herself, so we washed it off with dish soap and the symptoms slowly disappeared. I read the other comments of what this product has done to cats and I guess my cat is one of the lucky ones.I am now currently looking on line for non-chemical, more natural remedies....after all my cat went through, this product didn't even get rid of the fleas."
1,Did nothing for the fleas,"I bought this product for my cat because I was trying to save money (I usually buy frontline). While it didn't have any noticeable side effects on my 15 pound cat, it also didn't kill any fleas. I noticed one flea was a little sluggish a few hours later, but none died. And over a week later there are more fleas than ever before. Don't waste your time and money, buy the good stuff."
5,"Regarding ""Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly""","This song is indicative of the growing patriotic sentiment in the U.S., and I for one appreciate Aaron Tippin and others like him for songs like this. It's unfortunate that it took a tragedy to remind Americans of how lucky they truly are, but better late than never... To the author of ""Fly This""--I think I speak for most people when I say that we are tired of self-proclaimed intellectuals like you that don't realize how lucky you are. Either get with the program or leave."
2,Beware...,I guess I really can't say if I like these or not because I didn't understand that they CLIP ON to an existing SPD or Look pedal. I thought they were going to be like the ones at the gym where there is a SPD clip on one side and a cage on the other. The bike I have at home has cages only so now I get to return them and figure out where to get the ones I want.
1,Toe Clip part is very painful,I bought three pairs of these for my indoor cycling studio. It was shown as a common pedal for indoor cycling classes and I assumed everyone cant be wrong......well....they were kind of wrong.As a SPD or Look pedal I had no complaints from clients.For clients who used their gym shoes I had complaint after complaint. I decided to take the class with the bikes with these pedals and my feet still hurt a week later. I don't think there is enough foot space for the shoe and and the whole class I felt like all my weight was at the very front of my foot.I am returning the three pairs that I bought and replacing them with the stock pedals until I find a spd/toe clip variation that is comfortable.
1,schwinn tr,The bike is very dificult to pedal I think the wheel is not balanced and was probably damaged while in delivery
2,Poor sound quality,Three entertaining movies but the sound quality is so poor that it greatly detracts from the experience.
2,Who' s afraid of Adam Smith,"I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me."
5,A blast from the past.,"We purchased the Inchworm for our grand-daughter. It was the same as the one we bought for her daddy 30 years earlier. He had so much fun with his that we had to get one for her. My son lives in Hawaii, so we had it shipped there for her birthday. The Seller did not ship the toy for several days/weeks. We contacted them and did not get a response except that it would be mailed soon. This was over a week past the expected delivery date. The price was the same as Toys-R-Us but we needed to ship it so it was bargain to order online.Quality of the product is excellent.Shipping & communication with seller is very poor."
5,Great Toy for small kids,It took no time at all to put it together and the boys were motoring around in no time. This one was a winner.
1,"Cute, But Doesn't Work Well","The only good thing I can say about this product is that it looks really cute and is visually appealing to my son. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work. There is no way a child could make it ""inch"" forward by bouncing. It is so stiff, I can barely get it to move. We received it as a gift, already assembled. I assumed that it must have been assembled wrong because it was so stiff, but based on the assembly instructions I can see that there is no part of the assembly that would cause it to be stiff. It is just the way the toy is manufactured. It would be okay as a push toy, but the wheels don't turn very easily, so my son can't really even push himself along without a lot of effort. Unless you just want a toy that is nice to look at, I would recommend you save your money."
2,"cute, but not practical","We have 3 kids ages 2, 3, and 6, none of them are able to make it move. It's too stiff and I even have to push it down really hard to make it move a little bit. It is very cute but impossible for young children to make it move."
1,Don't Buy It,"My daughter is 2 and a tall, strong girl. She rides a Radio Flyer tricycle all around our driveway. She could not even get this thing to move. It's horrible and a terrible waste of money. It just sits in our garage on the shelf since no one (not even our 6'2, 280 lb football player neighbor) could get the thing to move. It's cute, but that's about it."
4,Inchworm Review,"The Radio Flyer Inchworm is an adorable toy, perfect for a 3-year old. The advantages of this toy are that it's almost indestructible and requires the child to perform some physical activity. It works best if the child is heavy enough to make it go. Disadvantages are that it's difficult to steer and the noise it makes as it ""inches"" its way across the floor gets annoying after a while. Make sure you don't put the wheels on too tight so it can move freely."
2,"Cute, but that's about it","It's cute. That's it. It's tough to move along on the inchworm - it's intended method of locomotion (bouncing) only works with a lot of weight and effort. In the end, kids have to just scoot themselves with their feet. I'll get a trike next time."
1,Waste of money,"I read the reviews before buying this for my 3 year old granddaughter - and I should have listened. The inchworm won't bounce up and down unless I do it. It is most frustrating for both of us. My daughter had one years ago and loved it; we had such fond memories of it - but this model is a total waste of money. Sturdy yes; colorful yes; functional, not at all."
1,Don't Buy This Worm!,My 2 and 4 year old can't even make this worm move. I sat on it and tried to make it bounce and go. No luck! My two year old took it to the top of our steep driveway and it would not go down with her on it. Does not roll backwards and really needs someone to push the child who is riding it. Not a fun toy!
3,FUN BUT....,We had the original inchworm 20 years ago for our children....we bought this one for our grandchildren.....this version is fine but seems smaller than the original......all that said ours was a nostalgia buy
2,"Good for climbing but not for its ""inching"" purpose","Bought this inchworm as a classic toy, to share with my children -It is a fun product for the tots to climb on and push around - the wheels remaining static - but it doesn't inch with bounces from children that would be interested in making it bounce!It isn't worth the money spent. It is just a toy in the island of misfits here."
1,"A boring, sad, trite toy for my toddler.","This was giving to my 2 year old son for his birthday. It was easy enough to assemble and we put him on it immediately only to find he does not have enough weight or strength to push the thing down to make it ""inch"" forward. Now 4 months since having it, he still can not do anything with it but pull it while being off the toy. It's sad how this was ever considered a good enough product to be released to the public. We need higher standards."
4,Great Memories,"This brought back great memories, and , my son absolutely loved it. 18 months old and can not wait to get on it and push across the floor.My 6 yr old , keeps tryin to take it away, the only negative is shipping costs, would have been better to buy at store."
1,The Myth of Sisyphus Vividly Taught To Children By An Infernal Machine,"The greatest trick ""The Inchworm"" ever pulled was convincing the world that it was really a toy. My mother bought two of these contemptible devices for my two-year-old twins; how was she to know it was forged in the tenth ditch of the eighth circle of Dante's Inferno?""The Inchworm"" does not roll. It does not bounce. Nay, it does not ""inch.""It does, however, crudely flex up and down just enough to trick toddlers into believing that, if they continue pushing, jumping, rocking and leaning, the toy will at some point function.I assure you, dear buyer, that nothing will come of these efforts. If you, as a parent, have decided upon raising your children by way of the cruel tutelage of frustration, futility and fury, then, by all means, buy this product and teach your toddler early on to rage, rage against the immobility of the worm.Otherwise, I suggest you purchase a wagon or a tricycle."
4,My son loves it!,"We bought this for my 3 year old son who has massive sensory needs. He loves it, we love it, it is a classic. We were looking for an alternative to a tricycle as he is not ready for the pedalling motion yet. This is great. It does take effort for the child to move it forward and it does not move backards, but this was perfect for us as sensory input is supposed to offer muscles resistance. Your kids will get a workout with this, which is the whole point. It is great, simple, classic fun."
2,Disappointed,"I don't really have anything else to add that the other reviewers haven't already stated. My 2 year old was so happy to get this toy until he became very frustrated that it does not move. Even if I sit on it, a grown adult, it is difficult for me to get it to move. Needless to say, it is in our closet not being played with. Would not buy again."
2,Not as good the one I remember,"When I saw the Inchworm was back, I was so excited because I remember the one from the 70s when I was a kid. Radio Flyer should consider putting a weight requirement on this toy because you have to be adult-size to bounce it. My son got it for Christmas. He's a BIG 2-year-old weighing 40 pounds. My 4-year-old daughter also weighs 40 pounds, and she can't move it either. I believe it's supposed to ""inch"" along as you bounce up and down on it, but even applying all 40 pounds, neither my son or daughter can make it work. I, of course, can make it work, but I weigh 145 pounds! They scoot along on it using their feet, but it's hard to make it go, so they get bored with it pretty quickly. I'm so disappointed. I wish we'd gotten some other type of ride along toy for my son."
1,Would not Recommend,"We received this as a gift from my mother after a friend of hers told her how much her nephew loved it. Needless to say, it is almost impossible to move like other reviewers have stated. It was such a disappointment because I remember it when I was a child and I thought it was a great gift. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I don't have the heart to tell my mom that I will now be passing it along with the help of Freecylce. What a waste."
2,Streaks in weeks,"I bought these for both of my vehicles (an SUV and a coupe), and they all began streaking after less than a month of light use. It seems as though the force of the wiper arms is not properly transmitted to the full length of the blades. The edges are left clean, while the center is left with 2"" to 3"" gaps wherein the blade doesn't even make contact with the windshield."
5,Gunsights,"I love Raylan as a character. He has a dry insight into life & a black & white view of the rights & wrongs of life. If something goes wrong & someone dies or gets shot ""It's Justified"""
3,"Elmore Leonard's ""Gunsights""","It's worth a try for any western novel fan, but I thought that the plot dragged, & I didn't care for the prose. William W. Johnstone's books make for a better read."
4,Read the book,"Do the reviewers who write for Publishers Weekly actually read the books they review? Or is it just that their liberal bias won't allow them to give serious consideration to any book by or about a ""conservative"" Republican. Certainly the Author's arguments and the facts he presents made no impression on them. They simply brushed it all aside in order to reassert the tired old myths about W. G. Harding propagated by liberal Democratic historians like Arthur Schlesinger, jr.A little objectivity would make for greater credibility."
2,I Kept Waiting,"As a personal reflection, memoir, this book can be mildly entertaining. However if you like I were waiting for some guidelines about forging a way to a more intelligent dialogue that goes beyond the partisan mud-slinging, that passes as ""meaningful political discussion"" these days, I and probably you will be disappointed. I felt there were two chapters that hinted at what these guidelines might be, and then there was a great deal of what the author complains about in others-""psychobable"". As a pure memoir, if this book were described as such, I would had added a star, but if you read the prologue, and perhaps two chapters...the rest is a recycled idea that is never in my opinion flushed out fully. Too bad for the book starts out very promising"
1,Bought Item for my 13 year old granddaughter for Christmas,"I was so excited waiting for this notebook to come. My excitement turned to frustration and dismay when I received it and found that it was not as the listing stated. First starters, the harddrive is 5.58GB, not 12GB. The difference in size is a big issue. The body has a crack in it and there is a hole on the side like a piece of it was removed. None of this was listed in the description when I purchased it. The ""hole and crack"" makes it impossible for me to give to anyone. If there is anything else wrong with it, I don't know because I put it back in the box. The stated issues were enough for me.Dell Latitude CPX Notebook (650-MHz Pentium III, 128 MB RAM, 12 GB hard drive)"
1,Came with a broken USB,It came with a broken usb port and the computer is so old that is the only usb port there is. I bought this for my daughter for christmas and she cant even charge her ipod of download her pictures from her camera... Very unsatisfied...
1,junk,"this is a piece of scrap!, no internet connection its the oldest model of laptop ever heavier than three laptops put together i wasted my money :("
1,Poorest Customer Service Ever,"I needed to return a Dell computer based on their ""so-called"" customer satisfaction guarentee. I have now spent 3-4 hours on hold, been hung up on twice, and have talked to approximately 10 very friendly but completly unhelpful Dell customer service employees, none of which seem to speak english as a first language, who have bounced me back and forth from department to department. The only time I actually got through to the Returns Department......their computer was down! Absolutely the poorest service i've encountered in the electronics industry. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,SIMPLY NOT SO GOOD SALSA,"I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER HERE, THIS IS A FOUR CD COMPILATION, AND ONLY A FEW OF THE SONGS ARE REALLY WORTH HAVING, THE REST IS PRETTY MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD SALSA MUSIC, DOESN'T STAND OUT AT ALL. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD, AND I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT."
2,Acceptable,"I was a bit disappointed with the music on this four-cd collection. The muaic has very strong sentiments to '80s style with somewhat cheesy content. I would not play this for a serious modern salsa styled party as some pieces have that awful ""ewh"" response. I eventually only placed about 6 pieces onto my iPod out of the 52...not a good proportion."
2,Crappy blade,This is one of the dullest knives I have ever had the displeasure of owning! It cant an edge at all!
3,Well-Written But Mediocre Photography,"There is much useful information to someone learning how to photograph nudes. If it had sufficiently covered nudes in natural light, it would have deserved 4 stars. Although there is much useful information in this book, there are also some bad ideas, possibly explaining why many of the photos are mediocre or poor. The challenge someone may have is in determining what information to discount."
3,Good books for starters,"After reading I am now more knowledgable on the subject but it seems to not fully explain the subject. If the old saying,""the proof is in the product"" is true than this book lacks some proofo because some of the pictures are lackluster but for beginners it is a good book, but for photography i wouldn't rate as highly."
3,Very informative but leaves some information out.,The book is very good but the authors have stressed the artist nude which is good as opposed to the erotic of raunch of pornography.(Page 13) The authors have failed in one area in that where does one market such work. A photographer as anyone else has to eat too!
2,"Good advice, bad photographs.","This book has some good information. The authors seem to be knowledgable about the technical side of photography, but don't have the eye for it."
5,"THE BOOK WAS ""MESMERIZING""","I ENJOYED THE BOOK LEOPOLDVILLE,AND NEVER KNEW OF THIS COVERUP,HOWEVER I WAS NEVER TOLD NEVER TO MENTION THIS DISASTER.I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES TO HAVE SURVIVED,IN AS MUCH AS I WENT DOWN WITH THE SHIP. THIS BOOK WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO READ AS WITH EACH CHAPTER I RELIVED THAT TERRIBLE ORDEAL. I AM VERY HAPPY,THANKS TO THE AUTHOR,THE PUBLIC IS NOW AWARE OF THIS TERRIBLE COVERUP.IF ANYONE WHO WAS IN THE 264th CO.A AND WHO KNEW ME CONTACT ME AT.....wnadle@aol.com"
5,This book should be read by all World War II students,"The torpedo that hit the Leopoldville was an ""act ofwar."" But author Andrade brings out the real tragedy: thesubsequent 50-year coverup and the emotional, wrenching pain of the survivors and the intentional deception of families left in the dark for a half century. This book should be required reading for students of World War II history to see a darker, unknown side of warfare that they'll never see in textbooks. Allan Andrade should be commended for his perseverance and diligence in digging for the facts."
4,good product for the price,I like this instead of focus factor or other products. Seems to work and increase focus when I golf.
1,NOT MUCH HELP,"i am 44 years old. i should say that this product helps but very, very little in my case. i am now using another brand."
3,It's Ok,I have not received the results from thisproduct as I hoped. One time it kept me upall night. Take this as early as possible.Ginkgo works better
1,Dated,"As a book in the cycle of life it is a little dated. The information is not usefully presented. To use the material in classes I teach, which I did, I had to add a lot to make it functional for the students."
3,man i'm getting tired of this!!!,"ok -- the picture of this item was changed due to my dissatisfaction. they used to have a picture of an extended magazine, which i ordered, but they sent me this one, the standard one. i wrote some dissatisfied feedback almost a month ago, and the guy in charge of keeping Amazon happy called me and made a deal with me that if i deleted my feedback, he would send me the mag i ordered. well, its been like 2 weeks and it still hasn't come, i dont know what happened; i don't know if it got lost in the mail or whatever, but what i do know is that if the guy intensionally tricked me and never even sent me the mag that i will never order off airsplat again, and will discoredge anyone else from doing so either!!i'm sick of this !!all i wanted was a stinking maglol"
4,Product? Good. Editorial Review on here? Not good.,"Right up there in the Editorial review, it says ""Each of the four Kodak Max AA NiMH rechargeable batteries offers a 1,850 mAh capacity rating...""This device comes with 4 Kodak batteries - so it seemed to me that it was implying that this came with 4 Kodak Max AA NiMH rechargable batteries that were 1,850 mAh...But no. It comes with 4 1600 mAh batteries.Not a huge deal, but it is particularly annoying for me since I was going to buy something else and then switched to this specifically because of what that said.But I want to use this stuff now, so I'm not going to go through the trouble of returning it all."
2,So - So,"This charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully. I thought that my rechargable batteries were ""out of life"", but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully. My Daughter brought home a cheap Sakar overnight charger when visiting. I popped in a set of batteries I thought were done for, and found them to be just fine using her Sakar charger. What happens on my charger is that the lights (indicating that the batteries have been fully charged) all go off, and the batteries are ""cool to the touch"" (indicating that they have been fully recharged). Nope! Only about half way recharged."
2,Poor to middling quality - breaks under heavy use,I have two of these chargers that I bought directly from Kodak for about $10 each. Each of them came with 4 AAA batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package. One of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use. Battery charger technology is not all that complicated but Kodak doesn't seem to have mastered it yet. No wonder they were practically giving these away. I'd avoid purchasing these now at any price.
2,problems with springs and batteries,"I bought this charger 11 months ago. It came with 4 Kodak 1850 mA NiMH batteries. After a few months of light use, the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 mA batteries should. If I use the batteries immediately after charging them, I can take about 20 pictures (while my 2000 mA NiMH batteries can do >60). If I charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves, they won't be useful after only a week.The charger is capable of charging both AA and AAA batteries. But a few months ago, 1 spring for switching between AA and AAA stopped working properly. This was after very light use. I only charge AAA batteries once a month.The market for NiMH batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago. I would not buy this Kodak if I were to buy today."
1,Didnt Travel Well,While traveling in China I hooked up this charger to a Sharper Image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking. A much better buy would be the Sony charger with worldwide voltage and for 5 dollars less.
2,Does not wake up sometimes,"When the monitor actually wakes up, it works nice. The problem is, it sometimes doesn't wake up for hours. Cycling the power doesn't work, restarting the computer doesn't work, unplugging the monitor doesn't work. It just seems to have a mind of its own. It seems completely random. I did contact their help line, and by the time I got the response, it was working again, and they said they couldn't help if it was working. Overall, very inexpensive, but I wouldn't buy another one no matter what."
1,Monitor Fails twice after 1 yr.,"The image quality of the AL2416W monitor is very good, but it has a chronic problem. I purchased 3/21/2007. It failed to turn on on 2/6/2008. It was repaired and it failed again to turn on 5/17/2009. Each time I shipped this monitor back ACER failed to send a shipping box and said that any loss or damage due to shipping was my problem. The warrantee ends 8/2/2009 with commitment to extend due to this chronic problem."
3,This is 6 bit TN panel,"This is a 6 bit TN panel not 8 bit P-MVA panel. There are other 6 bit TN panels at better price than this one. The better Acer one to get is AL2416WD around four hundred dollars. If you are a photographer, skip this monitor."
4,Pretty good,"Ill admit, im not to big into mystery games and solving puzzles. But for some reason, this game kept my interest, and it still does, because I havnt beaten it yet.Im planning on succsefully completing this game although I have been using alot of cheats."
2,Too much for the Xbox.,"Without a doubt, Dark Corners is an ambitious game. The setting is wonderful, the graphics, sound, and level design good, the HUDless system innovative.Unfortunately, it's too ambitious for the hardware. In the early levels it's adequate, but by the end of the game Dark Corners becomes a sludgefest of stuttering sound and graphics. How does this happen on a console game? The designers had to know what resources they had available, and should have reduced the effects to make it playable.On a fast PC - with fixes for the minor bugs - this would be a 5 star game, but the inexplicable failure to tune the game for the platform is completely unacceptable."
2,had potential,"I gave up on this during the chase scene when those guys were chasing you in the hotel due to slow controls, blurry screens and slow movement. Very annoying, this game should have been alot better."
2,Great for a few months,"The remote died. Tried reset. Changed batteries. Seems there is a poor connection inside. It had similar temp readings as the nearby international airport, SJC, so probably accurate."
1,Eats batteries,"Can not recommend this item. Compared to other weather stations I have it uses batteries 3 x as fast. Does not update temps good even tho the sensor is less than 12 ft away. Same brand at Walmart, and was considerably less than the posted price here of over $25."
1,Not worth the price!,"I too had the problem of the remote reading -- after 2 weeks of tranmitting just 50' away in my greenhouse. After spending a fortune replacing batteries every 2 weeks like clockwork, I returned the item for refund. I have an earlier model which doesn't eat batteries, but the additional remotes are no longer available for it. Will be purchasing the Taylor 1458 and additional remotes to monitor all my greenhouses."
1,Very Unreliable,"Much the same experience as the other reviewers reported. The sensor would stop reporting temps to the receiver even though only 5 feet apart through open space. Bettery life seemed okay, at least for 3 - 4 weeks while I tried this product. I checked battery condition thinking that might be the cause of the problem, but all batteries showed GOOD on the tester. (See comments about battery life by other reviewers.) I am returning this product, and possibly going for a different brand."
1,Not worth the effort,"Pros: NoneCons:1. Display is very small with poor contrast2. Eats batteries!! (Outdoor sending unit batteries need to be changed every 2-3 weeks!)3. Weak wireless transmitter (would not go through wall to receiving unit 5 feet away (claims ""100 ft range""!), but would go through window to receiving unit 7 feet away.After giving up on this one I tried aTaylor 1456 Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer Large Readoutunit bought from Amazon. Much better!!"
3,Fred Nolan is one of the best...,"Fred Nolan is one of the most recognized and popular historians of the old west, but where he makes many of his mistakes is by repeating too many things written by previous authors without sufficient evidence. I find most of his statements impossible to prove incorrect, but there are a few problems in his writing. Also, the editing of his book has a few flaws in that there are many glowing contradictions within the book. But, if you can figure out where the errors were made, the rest of the book is interesting and appears to be factual. In comparison to the other books currently on the market on Billy, this is one of the better ones, especially if like good pictures.."
3,Just OK,"We got these as an office treat with a gift card we received from a client. We are all chocoholics, & love to try new brands. These got really good reviews, so we thought we would give them a try. These chocolates were....disappointing. There is nothing special about them. They taste like every other grocery store brand of chocolate. Ghirandelli has much better flavor than these do, & I can pick that up local. If I had to do over, I would have picked something else. The chocolate wasn't bad, just not as good as I thought it would be for the price."
1,Poor service.,I requested a cancellation soon after I placed the order and long before they shipped. Their procedures are obviously set to take the money and run.
4,the Lavender Cookbook,"It is comprehensive for all recipes, e.g. entrees, salads, desserts, etc. Have not tried any yet related to time and travel restrictions, but they sound delicious for those who really like lavender...as I do."
5,great and rear recipes,"Its not often you can find recepies with lavender since it is very difficult to combine it with other ingredients. really helpfull, even for professionals."
5,Exquisite!,"Last year I attended a cooking class at Sur le Table where Sharon demonstrated some of her recipes, and the entire class was in culinary heaven! Sharon's collection of recipes using lavender is diverse and unique, and will add a sumptuous note to your cooking repertoire. Elegant or simple, these recipes invoke images of France, and inspire me to invite friends over for special meals. This cookbook will be one of your favorites! Enjoy! Edible lavender can be ordered online from Dean & Deluca http://www.deananddeluca.com/"
5,Absolutely Delicious,"I have tried 3 recipes from this book since I received it and have loved each one. The lavender brownies were wonderful and my husband and I loved the polenta and mushroom dish. We purchased lavender from our local Penzeys spice store. I think the jar cost us somewhere between $3-$4.If you have never cooked with lavender before, I encourage you to try it. It adds a very subtle flavor and works with a variety of different types of foods.When you read the recipe titles in this book, you will feel as though you are reading a menu at a fine restaurant. The result...fabulous food! I am excited to try the other recipes. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Somewhat insulting to college grad's intelligence,"The book does cover all the basics, but it's painfully insulting in parts as it drones on about basics like avoiding passive voice. Didn't I learn this in high school?Ten years ago the books must have been pitched to a higher level."
4,still good after all these years,"just played it after 2-3 yers of sitting on the shelf, some tracks still rock."
4,could be better,I love the geared rewind. Comes back fast. A larger clip on the end would be a big benifit for real estate agents and appraisers.
4,Great Hits package,"A greatest hits collection from one of America's best bands. This is a two disc set contains some of thier mid to late 70s songs which are often overlooked. I think this is the best ""greatest hits"" type disc the Allmans have out. A fan of the group probably has most of these cuts on other lps, but its a great overview of thier 70s material for someone who is just discovering this great southern rock band"
2,Disappointing,"I purchased Rice N Shine the first time and started drinking this as a chocolate smoothie made with skim milk every morning as a meal replacement for breakfast. I found that it satisfied my hunger, and I felt more energy throughout the day. However, I stopped taking it after purchasing the product a second time because I noticed a significant amount of weight gain. It is a shame that this can't be produced in supplement form."
2,Causes weight gain,"RICE N SHINE by Patty McPeak (chocolate) ~ As Seen On TV ~I was unable to find detailed information other than marketing hype on this product and still do not know what the 120 antioxidants are in Rice N Shine. I mixed the chocolate flavor with skim milk for 3-4 weeks on two separate occassions, and gained weight both times. The product tastes awful mixed with just water.There was a definite increase in my energy level and improvement in diastolic blood pressure (I have high blood pressure), but I can't use a product that causes weight gain. Patty McPeak needs to make this in pill form or with less calories."
4,Tastes great!,"I purchased one bag of the Vanilla on Amazon. I love the taste and consistancy-nice and smooth. I mix it in the morning in a blender with orange juice, banana and frozen strawberries. I love smoothies so this is a quick way to make them and it's healthy. I try different things with it like skim milk and bananas, skim milk, a half teaspoon of cocao, and a few drops of vanilla extract and ice cubes to make a great chocolate shake. I love it. I neither noticed a weight gain nor weight loss, just gets me through the day without the hunger pangs. Off to class-in a hurry-can't eat-this is great."
2,Poor quality,"I used this board a couple of times, and it warped, split, and felt very rough to the touch after rinsing it in warm water. I am returning it."
5,VERY GOOD!,"Even though I'm only 20 years old I read this book when I was about 9 years old, and let me tell you this book is GREAT! I loved this book from the beginning till the end and I read it alot of times. I recommend this book to anyone- regardless of there age. I'm pretty sure they would enjoy it"
5,The Dollhouse Murders,I liked the book because it was really mysterious. There was a spirit in the house using a doll house. Once I started reading I didn't want to put the book down until I had finished it. It is my favorite mystery book.
4,Good and Very Creepy!,"I read this book when I was in like, 3rd or 4th grade, but thinking back about it, it is seriously creepy!!! Especially if you have a doll complex lol. But seriously, this is a really good book, it has a great plot with lots of points and is surprisingly suspenseful! I am 14 and cannot WAIT to read it again! So yeah, it is a really good book, and makes the hairs on the back of your next stand up! I wouldn't read it when babysitting or home alone!:)"
4,A childhood treasure,"**Spoiler alert**I wanted to re-read an old childhood read of mine, and this book is it.Amy goes to stay with her Aunt in a big country house that belonged to her great grandparents. She discovers a beautiful dollhouse that is the exact replica of the one she's staying in. She notices strange things going on with the dollhouse. She sets out to uncover the mystery surrounding the dollhouse...The one thing I didn't like about this book is the way Amy's mentally challenged sister is treated by Amy and the rest of her family. They treat her like she's a ""retard"" instead of just being mentally challenged. Kinda mean.The book did had a happy ending, and the family ""sees"" the error of their ways in the end.All clouds have silver linings. :)"
3,good first mystery,This book has a great premise --- a young girl stumbles onto a wonderful dollhouse which holds the key to a very old mystery. There are some suspenseful parts but not so spooky to be worried about nightmares (I hope).
3,Dollhouse is ok but has errors.,"The Dollhouse Murders is an interesting but flawed look at the workings of modern forensics. Anyone who is curious about how a crime scene is dealt with will certainly find lots of material here that is new and interesting.There are at least three flaws in the book, however. The first is right on the front cover. Instead of six crimes, there are only four. Two of the investigations were not murders.There are two other errors, but I will leave it to the reader to find them. One is in the bakery robbery scene and the other is in the hotel invastigation. Good luck!"
5,Very happy with this book,"I got the book in record time and in good condition. It was a great buy, too. I would heartily recommend this book and this seller to others!"
5,"Quick delivery, works great",Simple device. Received very quickly through standard USPS. Within just a few days. no problems with programming and worked right away.
5,"CUTE SHOES, GREAT PRICE",What else do you want? Cute. Skechers. Great Price. The baby will be stylin' in these!
5,i'm in prison and have a diesel mech. degree.,p.s. the auto-renewal ordering is a nice touch as well.i'm in prison and have a diesel mech. degree completed during my stay. keeping up w/the chg's in technology is much easier w/the mag's i have. this is one of my favorites.
1,Disappointed,"I received this item, used it once, downloaded the pictures to my computer, placed this item back into the camera and it would not work. I returned the item in August 2003 and have had no response about a new one being sent or a refund. I am very disappointed because I really do like this type of item. I am waiting for a response...and still waiting..."
3,Return To Something Else,"Despite moderate critical success and subsequent backlash in the mid-nineties, Bis has lately received most of its attention for its theme to the Powerpuff Girls. Whether you think these bug-eyed cartoon superheroes are too hip for TV or you don't get what all the marketing and hype is about, your opinion on the Cartoon Network's cash-cow is going to be the same as your opinion of this Scottish disco-pop trio. Spreading their low-fi Casio cheer Bis is new wave for the new millennium."
4,Wow,"The difference between this and Social Dancing: Social Dancing is highly offbeat pop with an inescapably cultural influence. Return to Central is offbeat with an inescapably cultural influence, and it doesn't even pretend to be pop. This is easily the grittiest, edgiest, and (yes) darkest work they've ever done. And all I can say, really is...cool. (""Hella"" cool, if you prefer.) Not for everybody and certainly doesn't fit anybody's definition of pop...but then, that's pretty much always been the point, hasn't it?Lyrics could be a *little* more understandable, and the ""filler"" tracks, Black Pepper and Metal Box, are just redundant. Outstanding work otherwise. Damn shame it ended up being their swan song."
5,Thought Provoking Lessons about Life,If Tony Franklin says it is true you can take it to the bank. This book is more than just an account of the Mumme Era. The approach that Tony has used to tell his story is set forth in lessons that apply to all walks of life. You do not have to be a football coach or fan to understand the valuable lessons brought forth in this book.Some will read this book and say there is no way that what is written can be true. I truly believe what is said in this book about the Mumme era is a correct accout of what happended. Tony Franklin is a man of character who as his book states is a stand up type person.Read the book with an open mind. Many will not know the names of the coaches and players mentioned but you can relate many of the lessons taught to your personel life. The things that happened at a division 1 SEC school will boogle your mind.
2,Re-Charger doesn't work either,"After many frustrating phone calls to customer support on my DX3900 Kodak camera, I puchased a quick charger for the batteries for my camera. The dock DOES NOT charge these batteries. I also puchased an extra battery so that I would never be caught short. Well the quick charger lights up , blinks then goes off...indicating a full charge. When the battery is placed in the camera it last all of 4 pictures...then shuts down. I am TOTALLY disgusted with this product and all it's accessories. I have spent OVER for a camera that doesn't work. Don't waste you money on the quick charger either!Obviously, I have a BAD camera and Kodak won't admit it!"
1,I agree with Peter J Moore,The exact same problem. The charger failed and it is now outside of the 30 day return period.
5,Hooray to The Insightful people At JSP for another great disc.,"JSP has so many GREAT disc's by up & comers who went on to stardom later. This one has ""Jr. Boy Jones"" doin' Two tunes,One an early version of ""Fast Woman"" one A great instrumental titled ""Stinky Dink"". Three by now legendary Guitarist ""U.P. Wilson"" [also one great instrumental titled ""Chankety Chank""]. Guitarist & Soulful singer ""Bobby Gilmore"" has Three here, [one a duet with U.P.

Almost an hours worth of songs that mostly you'll only find here! Highly Enjoyable And Recomended To those Blues Guitar Junkies out there.. This was an exceptionally enjoyable find!! Thank You ""JSP"""
1,Not satisfied,This ring was tarnished within two weeks of my husband wearing it. Where it was once silver it is now brown.
1,Batteries don't hold a charge,"I bought this set for my new digital camera and am highly dissapointed. The batteries do not hold a charge as well as other brands do. While the charger may work fine for other things, do not expect your digital camera to run for more than 20 shots on these meek things. Overall, I am very dissapointed and do not recommend this product."
3,A Django performer I never new about.,I read about Diz Dizley in the credits on one of my many Django albums.I never new he existed and never dreamt a Brit would be a big Djangoinspired guitarist. It is an old master and the sound quality is not up tothe quality of today. I bought this only because I'm a Django fan and itgives me one more album for my archives.
5,It touched my heart.,I couldn't put this book down. Not matter how I tried. It is a great short story and easy to read even for someone who doesn't like to read.The story touches your heart and reminds us how simple little encounters with people everyday affect our lives. It show how God touches every part of our lives.Reading this book has gotten me to read other Max Lucado books.
5,Beautiful thoughts to lift you up....,"Once again, Max Lucado manages to use elegant but simple words to imbed beautiful thoughts to lift you up.... Make no mistake, his works are geared toward Bible Believing Christians or those who want to learn more about God's Love and the Bible. His analogies relate to the ""common"" people as he assures us that we are all unique in God's eyes. It is nice to read, as it is separated into small readings - so you can read for 5 minutes or an hour - perfect for me before going to bed. Hope you enjoy too."
4,"Relaxed, enjoyable reading over a cup of coffee. Great book for a male for a change.","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was short but the kind of a book a man would enjoy. Talks about his personal events with his family and with lifes events. This book I bought for another person, I wanted to share it."
2,School Book,"Bought I for my son's reading in school. He didn't like it and from the description, it seems to be a pretty depressing book for middle school. What happened to reading ""To kill a Mockingbird"" and other classics?"
3,meg weir review,"Walk Two Moons is a interesting book. The end of the book was very sad,when Sal finds out her mom died then her gradma?! This story is a very exciting and sad one. I hope you liked it or will like it! I loved it!!!"
5,A great exciting story,"From the moment you open the cover of the book and start to read the first few sentences, this book has you begging for more. You never want to put this book down! By the end of the book it really feels like you know the characters' feelings. This is a great book and i recommend it for ages 10 and up."
4,Kayla's Enrichment Review,This book was GREAT! This has been the first chapter book I have read full since October. This is an excellent book. It's about this girl named Salamanca. She moved away and made a friend named Phobe. They became really close. Her mom moves away at the end of the story. That part is sad. I like the part when she meets Phobe. This book is very good.
4,Good.. very Good,I liked the book. One thing was I thought it took to long to get interesting. But when it did it was good. Sal is very brave and has been through a lot and I wish I had her courage. The book had a very surprise ending. It made me cry. I think this is and excellent book and everyone should read this story.
4,The Trip of Truth,"This is a story of a thirteen year old girl and her friend. This girls name is Sal and her friends name is Phoebe. Sal and Phoebe both loose their moms. I think this a story of love, mystery, judgment, hate, family, wonder, and friendship. This is a story that will touch your heart. Walk Two Moons is a keeper.By John Kaprian"
5,A Journey of Hope- by Haylie Thomas,"Walk Two Moons is a wonderful book filled with mystery, adventure, love, and hope. Sal, also known as Salamanca Hiddle and her grandparents are traveling from Ohio to Idaho to find Sal's mom. On the way there, Sal tells the story of Phoebe Winterbottom. Phoebe is a girl who is always stuck on herself and trying to act perfect, (along with the rest of her family). There are consequences to being too perfect, and Phoebe finds out the hard way. Along with Sal, Phoebe learns a lot about life. In the end, Sal is just a 13 year old girl fitting the last piece into the puzzle of her life.You should definitely read this book!!!!!!!!!"
1,bad bad bad bad bad,"This book did not make sense. The characters were horrible. Salamanca... by the way what kind of a name is Salamanca... Anyway Salamanca was basically a depressed teenager who's mom died, and then her dad moved them to ohio, and then her grandma died. This book was way to exagerrated and depressing and you could find a better book anywhere else. Don't read this trash it's bad bad bad. Your'e supposed to feel all emotional and you're supposed to cry and it's all just exagerrated junk.sorry to those who love this book... i know there are a lot of you"
2,walk two moons,Walk two moons was an ok book.I gave it two star's.It wasn't my kind of thing not a book I would read.Cause I wouldn't read it if i wanted to.It was a book about a girl looking for her mom.Who left and never came back now Salaminkathe moms doughter is looking for her to be there for her birthday.An shes on a journey with her grendparents.I think there wierd not like normal grandparents.One night they stop because its night and Salaminka wants to make it to where her moms at.So she takes her grandps keys and takes his car.and stops at a place it a ok book I recormend you to read it.
3,Not So Great,"Before reading this book by Sharon Creech, I had read Bloomability and Ruby Holler by Sharon Creech which were simply fantastic. However, I don't know how on earth this became an award winning book.In the beginning, it is really good but the interupptions by her grandparents are somewhat annoying. Phoebe, the girl who turns out to be her friend is sort of--well, off the wall.Also, Salamanca (the main character), to be a thirteen year old, has some dumb and immature ideas. At some points, I thought I was reading about a five year old.It is also stupid how Salamanca finds out about how mother died.It makes no since how her grandfather allows her to drive when she's just 13.Overall, I give this book 3 stars."
2,I was bored...,"This review is from my 10 year old son who just read this book at school:""I did not like this book at all. It had absolutely no adventure in it. It was basically this story of a girl driving to Idaho with her grandparents. The grandparents asked the girl to tell them a story and she tells a long story about this lunatic guy and it had absolutely no adventure. So if you like adventure books do not pick this book."""
3,Overall Satisfied,"The book was rated as excellant condition and for the most part it was. There was a name written on the book, opposite the spine on the pages that I wasnt aware of from the product description. Got the book really cheap so I am a happy customer overall!"
3,Sort of deserves a Newberry Medal,"Walk Two Moons is an o.k. book. The beginning is very interesting and the middle kept me reading. I found parts of it moving and inspiring. The numerous deaths definitely were unnecessary, though, and it felt like the author was trying to surprise you with a shocking ending, but I felt it was more like a depressing ending. Sal doesn't express emotion normally and too many answeres to the mysteries were held till the end, and because of this it did not keep me reading. The lack of answers to the mysteries until the end bored me and i probablywouldn't have finished it except I was required."
4,Walk Two Moons to Read This Book,"Walk Two Moons is a beautifully written book that captures all of your attention . Secret messages, disappearing mothers, and blackberry kisses are all mixed together to produce a Newbery Award-winning book that shares the humor, drama, and sorrow of thirteen-year old Salamanca Tree Hiddle's life. During Sal's long car trip with her grandparents to visit her mother, she tells the story of life in Euclid, Ohio about her best friend Phoebe Winterbottom. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great Book for Children and Adults,"This is a wonderful story of how a thirteen-year-old girl tries to come to terms with her mother's disappearance. Salamanca travels across country in search of her mother. As she travels with her grandparents she passes the time by sharing stories about her new friend, Phoebe Winterbottom. Phoebe has also experienced the loss of her mother. As Salamanca tries to help her new fiend deal with her fear and discouragement she realizes that she and Phoebe are very much alike. She understands that there are many who suffer from heartache and discouragement. she also comes to the realization that she can be happy again with the help of her family and friends. This is a wonderful book for all to read. But could certainly give hope and encouragement to children who may have lost a parent or someone dear to them."
5,Suprises In Store For You!!!,I'm a 11 and a half year old boy and I personaly loved and recomend the book Walk Two Moons to all pre- teens. The story stars a girl named Sal and she is on her way to visting her mother in Idaho for her birthday. The book is full of twists and turns and a shocking suprise ending.
5,Walk Two Moons:Creech'sbest!!!!,Walk Two Moons is one of my all-time favorite books! While reading it I felt as if I was Sal Hiddle traveling across the country in search of my mom. I understood how she felt about nature and her mother. I got so involved in the book that I cried when the sad things happened and the good things put me in a good mood! I could stop reading walk two moons cause it was so good!
4,Walk Two Moons is a book you don't want to put down,"Walk Two Moons is a great story about a 13-year-old girl named Salamanaca Tree Hiddle. Salamanaca is troubled by the leaving of her mother so she takes a wild trip from Euclid, Ohio to Lewiston, Idaho with her grandparents to keep her company. Sal tells a story to her grandparents about her friend Phoebe Winterbottom who lost her mother also. Phoebe likes to think that a lunatic kidnapped and she thinks that's the reason why her mom left. Phoebe keeps receiving strange messages but she doesn't know what they mean. In the end Phoebe and Sal have to face their problems and they finally realized that sometimes you need to think about other people before you think about yourself. I would recommend this book to mostly girls because this story is about a girl that goes through different struggles."
4,An innocently captivating book,"Walk Two Moons was recommended to me by a trusted teacher. I had heard of it before, but never felt the impulse to read this wonderful book. Once did start reading it, though, I couldn't put it down! It captivated me! The story and its characters are endearing to readers who enjoy innocent mysteries and seemingly trivial dramas. This book simply tells the tale of a young girl and her journeys, but the way in which it is told mesmerizes the reader. I highly suggest reading this book. Walk Two Moons satisfies the part of every reader that demands an excellent book."
5,A Truly Excellent Book!,This book was read to me in a college class and I instantly fell in love with it. I am now reading it to my fourth grade library students and they are equally enthralled. I highly reccomend this book
5,The BEST book EVER!!!!!,This book is by far on of the best book i have ever read!!! i recommend it to any who is wanting a good book!!!!
5,Best book I've read in quite some time,"My 8 year old daughter was read this book by her 3rd grade teacher and then brought it home from the library and put it in front of me. It was a wonderful book. I can imagine that the storylines are too complex and the topics too intense for young readers on their own. It's chock full of real-life events such as love, death, and all other facets of human life."
5,Best Read Aloud,"I have read this aloud to my students every year for the past 11 years. I cannot praise this book enough.Walk Two Moons has everything you would ever want in a book: humor, sorrow, wisdom, suspense, mystery, a surprise ending, unforgettable characters, and just good story-telling.My favorite part about this book is the characters. Sharon Creech has definitely succeeded in creating an amazing read aloud for any teacher or parent who likes to ""get into"" the roles of the characters."
4,Walk two moons-good book,This book is a very emotianal book. It is mostly about forgiving and forgeting. Creech does well describing the characters and thier feelings. this book is also about appreciating people and things. I would strongly recomend this book if you needed a new book.
5,Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover,"As Sal, Gram and Gramps travel to visit Sal's mother, Sal begins to tell the story of Phoebe. Through the story, she realizes that behind Phoebe's story is her own. While Sal is living next door to Phoebe, they have many adventures. Such as the Potential Lunatic, The Disappearance of Mrs. Winterbottom (Phoebe's mother), The Mysterious Mrs. Cadaver.I thought that the book was exciting, emotional, and teaches good life values."
4,Walk Two Moons,"""Walk Two Moons"" was an excellent book about thirteen year old Salamanca Tree Hiddle on a car trip with her grandparents in search of her mother, who left her father and her. Sharon Creech's words painted a picture in the reader's mind. On the trip, Sal tells her story and behind hers there's Phoebe's story. This book was wonderfully written and I recommend it to readers of all ages. I would gladly read it again. This book was a little corny. It seemed as if Sharon Creech ran all out of good ideas and just wanted it to end. I hope Sharon Creech writes a sequel or a prequel to this great book."
5,beautiful...,I couldn't tell you if I cried the first time I read this almost 2 decades ago but my tears are still going. this is my favorite book of all time. this was my first novel as a child...and hope to one day let my daughter read it. it's amazing to see what time does to our minds...and I can truly say that reading it a second time has me truly appreciating the skill of this author.
5,This is a great story!!,"I think this is a very underrated piece of work. I've always eyed this volume in my childhood, meaning to get around to reading it, and never did. I finally picked it up now that I'm 21 and I finished it in a couple of days. It's a very interesting story, and I don't think that it's slow as another reviewer has said. Even though the language is easy and is recommended for elementary and middle schoolers, I think that as a story in and of itself, people from all walks of life can find enjoyment in the pages therein. My parents are divorced, and although this story is not necessarily about divorce, it is about parental separation. The author touches on themes of grief and a kid's perspective in response to loss and tragedy. Overall, this is a touching story that explores profound life issues that is written in a quirky and enjoyable way."
4,WaLk TwO mOoNs!!!!!,"Walk two moons is about a girl named Sal and she is on a trip with her grandparents and she is trying to get to Idaho for her mothers birthday!!!! On the way she is telling her grandparent the story about her friend Pheobe!!!! Walk two moons is a GREAT book!!! It is one of the best book I have ever read!!!It goes back and forth between the story of Pheobe and what happens on her trip with her grandparents!!!I would recommend this book to children 9-14!!!! Walk Two Moons is a sad, adventurous, suspensful, exciting book and everyone should have a chance to read it!"
5,A wonderful book!,"I loved this book! There are only a few books that made me want to pick it up and read it again to see if I missed any of the clues. This book is at the top of the list! It is a touching book for anyone to read. The main character,Sal,is great! She tells the story of her friend, Phoebe Winterbottom, to her grandparents when they go on a trip to visit her mother. Phoebe's mother has gone away just like Sal's mother. Sharon Creech does a wonderful job putting two stories into one wonderful book. I recommend this book to pre-teens and their mothers. My mother and I both read it and we both loved it!"
1,A Disturbing Portayal of Women,"I am a graduate student preparing to become an elementary school teacher and found myself very disturbed by the portrayal of women in ""Walk Two Moons"", as well as the constant trauma that permeates this book. The main character's mother leaves her family behind after a miscarriage, followed by a deep depression which is glossed over in the book. The main character's best friend's mother also deserts her family as she goes to deal with the appearance of a son she had put up for adoption before her current marriage. And to add insult to injury, we find that the main character's grandmother went off on a three day affair with the ""egg man"" because the main character's grandfather was cursing too much. To finish off the list, another friend's mother is in a mental instution. There are no positive female role models in the book - something disturbing in itself. Add to that the never-ending stream of death and desertion and I can find little positive to recommend this book."
5,*I LOVE THIS BOOK*,"THE BOOK ""Walk Two Moons"" is an excellent book. It tells the story of a young girl's life after her mom leaves her and her dad gives her a new step mother. It also tells how she starts her new life in a new town and a new school with a lot of new friends and people. It will make you want to read it for hours non-stop, I promise."
5,This is a must read book!,"Salamanca Tree Hiddle's journey to Lewiston Idaho to see her Mother is not just about a car trip. As she tells her friend Pheobes story to her Grandparents she seems to tell her story too. This truly inspiring story is worth buying! I won't tell the rest, but you won't be able to put it down!"
5,Walk 2 Moons - Sharon Creech,"Walk 2 Moons is about a girl named Sal who goes on a journey with her grandparents to find her mother, who's left Sal and her father. On the trip, Sal tells her Grandparents a story about her friend, Phoebe. Phoebe's mother left her family too. This is a great adventure book. I would recomend it to anyone."
5,My Fave Book,"Sal was forced to leave her home in Bybanks, Kentucky, she left behind her home, her swimming hole, and most importantly the hope that Sal's mom would come back. When Sal comes to her new town she meets alot of interesting people, like Margaret her dads new girlfreind and Phoebe. Sal is telling you this story as she tells it to her grandparents while they drive her across country. She tells the story of Pheobe but in reality she is telling her own story. As Sal would say it's like how her dad found a fire place under some plaster in their old farm hous and after they received the news that Sal's mom wasn't coming back he started chipping away at it. Just like Sal finds her story behind Pheobe's."
4,Walk Two Moons,"For my last year in elementary school, our class read Walk Two Moons and Absolutely Normal Chaos. The two books sort of related to life as it is, but Walk Two Moons had a lot more adventure,friends,and family. Walk Two Moons was an excellent book to read.Walk Two Moons was about a girl named Salamanica who has to accept that her mother is dead. She had to move away from Bybanks Kentucky because her father has found a new job. Salamanica also has to go with her grandparents on a vacation and told her grandparents about her new life in Lewiston Idaho."
5,A Good Book,"One of a kind, for girls who like girl stories. A book for girls who know what it's like to think someone likes you, who have a friend who is a little strange."
5,A Book Worth While To Read!,"I loved this book! When Sal tries to find her mother she uncovers a horrible secret. This book inspired me to read more books by Sharon Creech.I know you'll love this book, too!"
5,WALK TWO MOONS WAS EXCELLENT,"This book was truly written well. It has a story within a story, which kept me interested. Sharon Creech does a wonderful job of creating Salamanca, and her Grandparents. They seem to just come alive. The content is great, and it has excellent conflicts, and resolutions. The young girl's search for her ""identity"" is truly heartwarming. A+++ Book."
2,did not spark interest,"My daughter is 9 and reads a lot! She loved Holes and would not put it down. I MADE her read 5 chapers of Walk Two Moons and she begged me to stop. She said it was not interesting. From the little bit I read, I tend to agree."
1,horribley wrote,this seemmed to me like a pointless book .it was long. this book was wierd.it was more interesting then my other book for summer reading.
1,What the does it Mean?,"This book was so pointless because I as soon as i read the 2nd chapter,i wanted to throw the book in the fireplace. This book was very boring and pointless. IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO BORING!!!!!I am sorry Sharon Creech but to me it is true."
3,A review of walk two moons by a 6th grade reader,"I think that boys will not like this book as much as the girls will. Despite this fact, if you can really read the book in depth you can begin to realize what the story is really about. It is incredibly moving and powerful even to a boy.Jonathan Oei"
2,"weird, sad.","I thought it was SO weird, and the end was SO sad. it was sort of boring to. The end, TO SAD!!!!!!!!!!! I think Sharon creech over did the deaths a little. It's not exactly my faverite book."
3,Walk Two Moons,Walk Two Moons is actually two books in one. The first book is about a 13-year-old girl named Sal. She goes on a trip with her grandparents to find her missing mother. They have a lot of obstacles to over come. They have 13 days to get to Lewiston for her mom's birthday.Sal entertained her grandparents by telling them Phoebe's story. Phoebe's story is about a lunatic. Then her mom runs away. Phoebe gets scared because she finds notes at her door. Then she goes to the park and she sees...I did not like it that much because there were so many characters. Another reason is there was such a big build up you knew what was going to happen. It was to confusing with all that was going on. It started out way too slow and that made it to boring. I would not recommend Walk Two Moons and I would only give it 3 out of 5 stars.
4,walk two moons,"Dylan O.Salamanca Tree Hiddle or ""Sal"" lives in Bay banks Kentucky and is moving with her grandparents. On this trip some amazing things happen to her, like some one is following her and she calls him a lunatic because he keeps putting notes on her door step. She also goes to a native pipe museum. One very hot day on the trip they went swimming in a river and the grand mother was bitten by a water snake and was rushed to the hospital. Then Sal and her friend Phoebe think that the lady across the street chopped up her husband and buried him in the garden. They saw their English teacher helping her in the garden and thought he had helped her. One year before her mom had died in a bus crash. The whole reason she was going to Idaho was to see her Mothers' grave and it was sad because she was searching for her Mother and at the end she found her moms grave."
3,Young Walkers,"Walk Two Moons, by Sharon Creech, was the Newbery Medal winner of 1995. This book is not a challenge of middle level readers, but would be for elementary readers. Sal is a preteen, taking a journey across the Midwest with her grandparents. The journey Sal is going on is to find her mother on her mother's birthday. Traveling with her grandma and grandpa, Sal tells stories about the year before and her adventures with her friend Phoebe. Sal and Phoebe suspected Phoebe's mother being kidnapped, Sal's father getting remarried, and a potential ""stalker"". Sal, Gramps, and Grams run across many road blocks along the way, making Sal a basket case because she is worried about making the deadline. In the end, things even out and evolve.We would recommend this book to readers of nine years of age to readers of eleven years of age. It will keep the avid readers glued to the book. While we thought it was a good book, it was not age appropriate for our reading level."
3,OK But Odd,I don't usually enjoy reading but I did finish this book rather quickly. I just thought it was odd. It was written in a 13 year old's perspective and that made it fun to read. It was mysterious and sometimes put you in suspense. I would reccomend this book for people to read but definitley for a one time read. I suggest to borrow it from a library because ou won't want to read it again.
5,A girl and her grandparents take a trip to find her mother,"This is the greatest book I have ever read in my entire life. The way Creech described everything- from the house, to the swimming hole, to her grandparents, to her mother, to her school, to her- was incredible. Not many authors can do what she can. Sure, many can write, but not like this. The wild adjectives, the vivid verbs, and the speech. This book captured me, and swallowed me in. I really thought I was in a car trapped between crazy grandparents. She would flip and toss the right ingredients, or words, in the griddle we call a book, so they tasted not bitter, sweet, sour, or salty, but just the right amount of all. Then she sprinkled with a georgous cover, and served. My compliments to the chef, Mrs. Creech"
4,O.K. book not neccesarily the best book but very good,This book is ok but I think Sharon Creech tried a little hard tomake it funny. But it is humorous. It needs a little moreseriousness. It gets much better as it goes on
5,Parents--this is a MUST read!,"I had avoided this book because I wasn't into ""Indian"" literature, then I took a class that had it as required reading. Boy, was I wrong about putting this one off! I could not put it down! I spent an entire rainy afternoon engrossed in this story, and used a full box of tissue to boot! I had students read it this year in literature circles. The boys thought it was okay; the girls loved it as much as I did. Be sure to read Creech's other books as the characters do a cross-over, but maintain their own seperate stories as well. I bought a copy to keep on my library shelf at home and multiple copies for my clssroom library."
4,A Tapestry of Stories,"Walk Two Moons is a book of stories. Carfully woven into a beutiful novel, each story is a thread that makes the book stronger. You will like this book if you don't mind being a little confused. You are in for a very special treat if you pick this book up. Every page reveals more information that leads you down a path where you only realize that there is a whole other conclusion. A tale that brings together people who think they are very similar but turn out to be very diferent."
5,Very thoughtful twisted,"Walk 2 moons was a very thoughtful book adding details everywhere. and the book misleads you in a good way which i not going to give away how and why. its also twisted but in a good way as well. for example you think one thing and you are so sure its true but then at the end it hits you ""wait! thats not right."" and then BAM the next sentence tells all. and it just surprises you. I would recommend this book to and boy or girl grades 3-7.you are never 2 young or old to read this book."
4,Walk Two Moons,"Salamanca Tree Hiddle, Sal for short, a thirteen year old girl, really gives Walk Two Moons a twist. This book is about Sal and her grandparents taking a road trip to Lewiston, Idaho. She is going there to find out exactly what happened to ""Sugar"" her dead mother. Sal tells two stories to us in Walk Two Moons. She tells her Grams and Gramps a wacky story about Phoebe and all the rest of the gang. One thing that happens when she is with her friend Phoebe is, Phoebe thinks she has a stalker. On her way to Lewiston, happy and horrific things happen to poor Salamanca, such as, her grandmother gets bitten by a snake, and something horrific happens to her, as in a result of the snake bite.I thought this book was a very well written piece of writing. I would recommend this book to practically anyone. It is one of the few books that I have read in my lifetime that I would definitely read again. Sharon Creech did a fantastic job with this wonderful book!"
1,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grade Class,"I would give Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech one star because it makes no sense. At one point the main charecter Sal (Salamanca) Maple Tree Hiddle is at her farm house, the next minute she's moving. Then she's with her grandparents on the way to Idaho, while telling a story at the same time. The book goes on like that. Sal tells about a friend named Phoebe Winterbottem. The Author confused me by having too many events at the same time and I couln't keep them all straight. I found this story to be a blur. But... I would recommend it to middle school readers and up. They may understand and enjoy this book more."
1,Uhhhhh,I did not like this book. A lot of people like this book. It isn't that I don't like her books. It is that I think the book was to old for me so I didn't get most of what see was talking about. If you are 10 and below I think this is to old for you and you won't get. If you do good for you.
1,really really boring and stupid,"This book is about a girl named Salamanca Tree Hiddle. She is going on a road trip to visit her mom. On the way she is telling a story to her grandparents. The story talks about a deranged paranoid girl who thinks her mother has been kidnapped. She also talks about how she likes to kiss trees. It is really borring. I don't reccomend this book for boys. It was an easy read and it was dumb. No one in my class liked it. I would not read it again if my life depended on it. Whatever you do don't read this, ""Book,"" if you can call it a book."
3,I thought that the book was O.K.,"I thought the book was O.K. because at some parts I lost intrest and at other parts I thought that the book was O.K. but, i was never hooked into it. I liked how there were three different stories so that if I ever got tired of one story there was another one comming right up. I thought that it was sad when Sal's mother passed away and then how Phoebie's mother came back after a few weeks."
3,Funny and Mysterious,"I think this book was O.K. Some others do not agree with me I know, but I just got lost. The story was boring.I thought the funny parts were cool though.If you need a bedtime story,this ones the best."
3,Walk Two Moons,"I have read both Walk Two Moons and Absolutely Normal Chaos and compared to Absolutely Normal Chaos, Walk Two Moons is a joke. Walk Two Moons keeps you guessing when you want to know what is going on. The story line is good but it is poorly told. Walk Two Moons is about a young girl whose mother died in a bus accident when she ran away from her family to find herself. Salamanica Tree Hiddle is the daughter of Sugar(the one who ran away) and she won't let herself admit that her mom is gone. When she and her dad moved away from their farm, Salimanica meets a girl who believes her mom is ""kidnapped"" by a lunatic and will not admit that her mom left on her own. The story line often goes off course. This book did have some good in it but I would only give this book a two stars because of the way it was told. I learned not to jump to conclushons and to be awere that everyone is not perfect and just to be myself."
3,Sal's Adventures,"When I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. It is about a girl,Sal who moves from Kentucky to Ohio. When Sal arrives she meets Pheobe. Through Pheobes wild imagination Sal has many adventures including meeting a potential lunatic and learning that Pheobes neighbor might have murdered her husband. Sal can relate to Pheobe because both of their mothers disapear. Towards the end of this book though it gets very sad and I thought that it took away from the book. Although some people like dramatic books like Walk Two Moons."
3,On The Road Again/ JARED age of 10,The reason i did two stars was because of at the end. when (gram) and mom die. That just made it bad in my opinion. my opinionon what the best part was. the story of pheobe witterbottom. if you dont know who that is you will find out early in the book. Pheobes storys take up about half of the book. Pheobes mom goes away for awhile. the reason she goes away is because she went to get her long lost unkown son. pheobe calls him the lunatic when she didnt know him. his real name is mike. thank you for taking the time to read my review!
5,One to read over and over,I cry every time I get to the end of this book. I have read it numerous times and I am still moved by the ending. READ THIS BOOK!
2,didn't like it,I know this is a very popular book that has won awards but I'm sick of sad books with dead mothers. So this wasn't for me.
5,Amazing,"This book is a book we have been reading in my school, and I know to most it's terribly sad, but for me it brought so many memories and created a very interesting discussion. I suggest you read it"
3,Salamanca's Secrets Unraveled,"A young thirteen year-old girl trvels to Lewiston Idaho with her Gram and Gramps and along the way tells them the story of her friend Phoebe Winterbottom who recieves messeges from a potential lunatic and whose Mother mysteriously disappers. Under Phoebe's story, Sal slowly and painfully dicovers her own. The two friends' stories are very similar. . . execpt Pheobe's has a happy ending."
3,walk two moons,"This book is an o.k. book.There is only one little problem towards the end when sal's grandparents started to cuse.I liked it when in the begining when sal started talking about her friends.One thing that the author did on some of the chapters ,left you in suspence. I thought it was funny when Phobe thought everyone was a lunitic.I also liked sal's other friend. I thought it was mean how people made fun of Phobe.It has a good plot.I like books by Sharon Creech.I can also relate to sal."
4,It's unique but it's for required tastes!,"Salamanca has a lot on her plate. Her mother has taken off to Idaho and nobody will tell her anything. During the course of the book which is easy reading for adults as well, this Newbery Award winning novel displays a girl seeking the truth to rectify her life at the moment. There are revelations and the book is used in middle school classroom as an approved material. There is nothing objectionable about it though.The author does a very good job but I thought it could have been better and more dramatic with the revelations in the end of the novel. I felt the book needed another revision in order to succeed and really capture the essence of the story. Apart from that, the novel is interesting but it's not for everybody like myself. I felt at times that I was dragging the novel along but I did finish it and I enjoyed the story but would have enjoyed it more with better writing."
3,Great Children's Book,This is one of my favorites from when I was a pre-teen. Great quirky characters!
4,walk two moons,i loved thih book.it is confusing at first but keep reading.If you do i know you will love it to.
2,Well-written however hard to get into,"As a huge fan of Sharon Creech's work, I was rather disapointed by this book. As well-written as it is, Creech failed to ""loop-me-in"" this time. I found myself uninterested in the plot and the character and eventually just had to stop reading all together.I would not reccommend this book. Not to say that you might not like it and it wasn't me, but the plot seemed dragging. Instead, I might read Creech's Bloomability or Absolutely Normal Chaos: two books where Creech really hits it right. Hope this was helpful! -Lia"
1,"Hated it, my mom did too","None of the characters seemed real to me, so I read this book not really caring about them. I thought the grandparents were very annoying. If I were Sal, I would be very angry that my father would not tell me the truth about my mother's death. And why include Ben and his icky blackberry kisses? EWWW I'm only ten, give me a break!!!"
3,Walk Two Moons,"I found ""Walk Two Moons"" a good read for a child between the grade levels 3-5. The story is about our main character, Salamanca Tree Hiddle and how she is off on an adventure to Ohio to find her mother, who left Salamanca and her Father. Sal (which is how the narrator refers to her throughout the book) is driven by her to grandparents, Gram and Gramps. To occupy most of the book Sal tells the story of Phoebe, her friend from school. Phoebe's story leads up to her mother and her secret. When you're not hearing about Phoebe, Sal and her grandparents and some crazy predicament that they have gotten themselves into. The ending provides and incredible twist that I would have never expected. Enjoy your reading!"
5,This book is a great read-aloud for upper elem students.,"As fourth and fifth grade teachers, we have read ths book to our students for several years. Every class has enjoyed the book immensely. This layered story teaches many literary elements that are useful throughout the school year as a reference point. It integrates with social studies and other subject areas. This story teaches the importance of relationships and appreciation for what you have. Today's students relate with Salamanca's and Phoebe's situations. An interesting aspect of this story is that students enjoy reading it the second time on their own, and as they do the story takes on new meaning for them. Read this book to your students. They will love it!"
2,Weird graveyard story,"Not that I think the author can't write, I know that there are many readers out there who loved this book... but I didn't. Several of my friends had read this book and absolutely loved it, so I eagerly checked it out from the library. I was pretty dissapointed. Though it was kind of entertaining at some points, I thought the book had strange characters, a wandering plot, and way too many deaths. I think that this book is more of what my mom calls a ""slice of life"" book. That's not really my type of book, I usually read science-fiction, so this was quite a change for me. Again, not to offend any Walk Two Moons fans, but I really didn't like the book, (judging from the general star ratings I guess I'm one of the few)."
2,Flaws spoil what might have been a good book,"A Newbery Award usually signals a book whose characters are killed off by the author. I have been looking for books that might help restore a broken relationship between a troubled thirteen year old girl and her mother. Out of the Dust was one such book and I had high hopes for Walk Two Moons. My daughter likes intertwined plots and the early messages were ones I wanted her to hear. As the plot became transparent and the book became another tale of adult dishonesty, disappointment filled my heart. Another Newbery Award winner, I should have trusted my instincts. Those characters not killed off were relegated to mental institutions. My only ray of hope is that contrary to the experience of so many blind people I have met, I may yet emulate another character in the book and read Braille within a short time if I should lose my vision."
3,Walk Two Moons Review,I thought this book was very strange. A person who likes fantasy or sci-fi books might not enjoy it as much as someone who reads realistic fiction books. A person like me will pick up this book with an intention of putting it down soon and find that they can't. It is if a magic force is glueing your eyes to the page. It's like this with Sharon Creech's books. The part I liked about this book was when the main character tells about her english teacher.
3,Not best of series,"When I read the book,''Chasing Redbird,'' I really liked it. When I read its sequel, ''Walk Two Moons, ''I was was kind of disappointed. I really like the author,Sharon Creech,and enjoy her writing. So after I read ''Walk Two Moons'' and was disappointed,it discouraged me from reading another of her books. I think that if the author got to the point quicker and made it less confusing, a lot of other young people would enjoy this book more. --JJ"
1,too confusing,Sharon Creech's Walk Two Moons was way too confusing. It is so confusing because Sharon Creech tells you all this stuff that you can't understand without knowing things that Sharon Creech tells you at the end of the book.
5,Walk two Moons,I found reading Walk two Moons a pleasure and very touching. I found it exciting and moving. I t is oneof those books tht makes you wonder what is going to happen next andone of those books that you can not put down. I know the age group is 8-12 years old but I always tell people aboout this book over 12 year old and they loved it. Everyone should readit!
5,I walked the best FIVE moons!,"The book Walk Two Moons is a mix of things. It is humorus, touching, and sad. It's the kind of book where you get a headache from turning the pages nonstop. It can have an impact on your life, and can learn a lot from Sal's personality. She is a girl who has had a lot of bad times, and is persistent all the way through. I would not have been that strong at all!Sharon Creech is a very talented writer, and once you read the first page, you will finish the whole book in a day! This isn't just a regular book to read, it's very special, and the best."
4,Walk Two Moons,"Walk Two Moons is about a girl named Sal and a girl named Pheobe Their both moms have left them and Sal and Phoebe both decide to go and try to find them. Sal is going to look for her mom with her grandma and grandpa. Sal's mother is missing so they move to a different town with her father. One day at her new school she meets a girl named Phoebe. After a while thy both became really good friends. After school one day they both find out that her mom is missing.I'm giving this story 4 out of five stars because it was fun to read and there were lots of excitement. The bad stuff about it was too long of a book. Their are too many people dying in the story, some times when its excitement it becomes not that exciting. After all it's still a good book."
5,Favorite book of all time,"I read this book with my 6th grade classes four years in a row. While my students generally found the beginning of the book to be a bit slow to develop, they were captivated as the book continued. By the end of the book, they wouldn't close the book-we always had to read the last ten chapters or so straight through! I loved this book because the ending caught me totally off guard, as it did my students. We laughed and cried and gasped in shock as we read this book together, and most of my students agreed this is a great book. Also, many of my students went on to read many other Sharon Creech books because they enjoyed Walk Two Moons so much. We also read Love That Dog together, and they really enjoyed that title as well."
4,Salamanca Hiddle,"Join Sal, Grams, and gramps on their journey to Lewiston Idaho. While Sal is in the car, she tells her own story while including it in Phoebe Winterbottoms. You will find out how phoebe has a thing for a potential ""lunatic"", and how sal has a grudge against Mrs. Cadaver. Find out why sal travles to idaho, and if she finds what she came for. See how it ends by reading this book. I would recommend Walk two moons to anyone! its a little rough at first, and quite boring. but by the end, you will absolutly love it, just like i did! i give it 4 stars, and 2 thumbs up!"
5,A Story I Will Never Forget!,"Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech is a story about pain, sadness, and realization. Salamanca Tree Hiddle and her grandparents set of on a roadtrip to search for Sal's mother, who has left Sal's family. Along the way, Sal tells her grandparents the story of her friend, Phoebe Winterbottom. As she tells this sad story, Sal realizes how she has suffered in the same way.I enjoyed this book. It has certainly had an effect on myself. I hope all readers read this book. You wouldn't regret it!"
5,and it all started,my friends allie epstien jillian freeman stefan apple dexter jarach and madeline or maddie lane read this book for bookclub as i looked at the cover it bored me half to death and i heard good reviews. then i had a book reaport come up and i chose this and i loved it. never judge a book by its cover. lesson proved. u should all read this book.
1,Don't waste your money.....,"There is a reason why this is an unauthorized account of Janet Jackson's life: it's so horrible that Janet would probably think her life actually sucked! The production of the video looks like it was copied/pasted on someone's home computer into a power-point presentation. The dry, uninspiring narrative reminds me of when I was in high school and had to watch a documentary on the chemical reaction caused by ammonia interacting with bleach. In fact, this was probably produced by the same company that creates those incredibly boring movies we had to watch in high school. I don't know what I'm more angry with: the lack of quality that this movie contains, or that I spent a whole $2.99 renting this. BE WARNED!!!! Save your money!!! There is so much more you can do with $2.99!!!!!!"
1,Broke quickly,"I liked this when it arrived. However after a few uses the pestle broke in two. The pestle is hollow and apparently quite fragile, making it of little use."
1,not what I thought it would be,stuff still shoots up at you . You have to put very small amount of herb in bottom or it's all over you. Donated to goodwill store
5,Little known chapter in WWII,Fascinating chapter of history I didn't know anything about until seeing this movie. I must for anyone interested in furthering their knowledge of WWII.
3,Interesting topic but not enough depth.,They told the story but did not delve deeply into the philosophy and rationale of Bose. It would be interesting to know what the consequences of Bose success would have been for India. No critique of Bose's approach or methods!
2,Mistaken again,"Broke my rule again, didn't get it from the library first. Very little I'd make in here and I'd have to be really bored. It's headed for ebay."
3,Sports Music,This CD was for a good cause and has a variety of music on it. The best part is Harry Carry the cubs announcer sing take me out the pall park at the end of the CD.
4,Great for kids,"My sons (age 8 and 5) love this CD - don't ask me why, but they get a big kick out of rocking out to it."
2,Weird,"I'll resist the temptation to choose the introductory voiceover from sports announcer Bob Costas, ""Music and baseball: A perfect combination."" Major league baseball players did this to benefit MLB's Trust Fund for Children, so I'll try not to sound snide or heartless. But rock songs about baseball make me wince faster than a Randy Johnson brushback. Yankee leftfielder Paul O'Neil drumming on a Kenny Rogers-style romp is something worth smashing a water cooler over. To their credit, most of the ballplayers who dare sing do it about as well as the scores of other singers in this world who try, unsuccessfully. But where's the John Rocker version of ""New York, New York"" I'd like to know?"
4,"Short, but very interesting","This book doesn't just talk about the logo design process, it gives the readers plenty of space to figure it out for themselves. It is a very specialized book, but also a very good book. Small, or big, business owners would be very well advised to read, and use, this book."
1,Save your money and buy something useful like toilet paper!,"To say that this book is a rag is to do injustice to the cleaning industry.This author is clearly not a logo designer, as 1) there is scarcely a logo in this book, and 2) the book is filled with archaic-looking illustrations out of a children's book from the 60's. If that wasn't enough to make this book completely useless, the text is irritating, and this already-tiny book is 50% blank space for you to write on your own! Ten cents at Walmart will get you a pad of paper to write your own half-baked excuse for a logo design book.If you want a real, professional logo design resource, may I recommendLogo Design Love: A Guide to Creating Iconic Brand Identities."
1,Not even worth the low price,Poorly manufactured product is unstable and one of the legs broke off the first day. I would give it more stars if it was sold as firewood which is what i used it for not three hours after delivery to my house.
2,Disappointed,"I bought two of these so that I could have a full size and half size stand (you can leave out a middle piece to make it shorter). It wasn't difficult to assemble, but the base is not made well. Some of the base pieces fit snugly and felt sturdy, but others wobbled and wouldn't stay in on their own, right from the start. The place where the base pieces fit in is not well made and it doesn't take much weight or pressure and the wood splinters and then the base pieces fall out and the stand won't stay up. I really liked the look of the stands and how they assembled easily, but it was a disappointment that they were not sturdy or very well made."
1,Coat Tree--CHEAP QUALITY,Purchased this coat tree for a small office where 3-4 ladies hang their coats on it. 2 weeks old...one of the legs broke. It is made from cheap wood and doesn't hold much weight at all. I put 2 nails in it and it has held together for a while since then.
2,Duong Nguyen,"The product has fine outside and its price is not expensive. But I'm disappointed with its quality.I have 2 problems with it:1. The product is made from an inferior wood.Yesterday, I had some friend visiting, I moved the stand from my bedroom to the dinning for my friends' coats. Soon after I put this product on the carpet, the track which is created at the bottom of the long stand in order to fix the three legs was broken. Noting that at that time, the stand was carrying some loads which I thought not heavy (a leather coat, a warm coat, 2 trousers).Today, when I tried to fix the problem, I realize that the wood is quite low quality. It tears easily when you put a nail on its body. Maybe only specialized equipment works.2. The product is not very stable. In order to keep it balance, I should arrange the load on its different hands symmetrically.Recommend other product if looking for a serious one."
2,"find another coat rack, dont waste your money","cheap product and quick assembly. but just poor quality. the day i got it and put it together my wife came home and picked it up to inspect it i guess, and the legs fell off (the legs dont stay on @ all, u pick it up and they slide right off). my wife put one of the legs back in the slot and the slot completly broke!! i had it about 6 hours!!!! i think this is a very simple product, but i most have got a really crappy one, so im saying dont waste your money"
5,THIS IS AN AMAZING CO TO BUY FROM!,"This tree stand was so easy to put together, shipped immediately and they also follow up with a phone call to see if you are satisfied.Love it and use it all the time. Wish it came in black and white.....I'd buy them again if they did! Email me if you ever decide to produce them in other colors.THANK YOU!"
3,ummm,"It came in great time. No hassle. Thanks to the seller! One leg did break last week and I used wood glue to repair it. It was my fault for putting too much weight on one side. Otherwise, I love it."
1,Piece of garbage,"I accidentally knocked over this coat stand a few weeks after purchase, and one of the legs at the bottom broke, and is beyond repair. You get what you pay for, I suppose."
1,don't buy this!,"i ordered two of these. one cracked the minute i tried to put it together. the merchant was kind enough to send a replacement, but it cracked soon after i had assembled it. the one i thought was fine cracked too. i did not put much pressure on - the base is defective. please do yourself a favor and give this a miss!"
5,tree rack,Product is very easy to assemble; well constructed and sturdy. Makes hat organization trivial. Shipped on time and packed securely. Would order again from same manufacturer.
1,Broke in a month,"Looked good on arrival and it was easy to assemble. However in a month or so, one out of three legs broke and the rack stand is uhm... not standing anymore. Now I need to buy a new one. What a waste."
5,I don't know what anyone could complain about.,"Sure, if you use a hammer to put the legs on, they will probably crack. Just be carefull, take your time and slide the legs into the slots made for them. The bottom cap will screw on over them and they won't fall off.If you're not smart enough to put this together without instructions, don't buy it!"
1,Poor quality product,"The finish was scratched. One leg was broken and in pieces. Another leg was broken and had been glued back together. Yes, it's cheap, but they should not be shipping broken merchandise that has been glued back together. It wasn't even a good glue job."
2,"Good quality, bad workmanship","I ordered this product only about a week ago and was very happy with the finish and quality of all the pieces. After assembling the legs, and pole part, which all fit very snugly, started assembling the arms that hold the coats. Everything went well until one of the pegs couldn't screw in as the metal part that accepts the peg was put in at an improper angle and is impossible to screw in. The product was very easy to assemble and look great, but with that missing arm I feel like we were cheated. It's a cheap product so you get what you pay for, just unfortunate as it would have been perfect accept for the one defect."
4,It Racks!,"One of the pegs is broken after a few months of regular use. Not a problem, there are several more pegs. Cat knocked it over once. A good rack."
1,TERRIBLE COAT RACK,"This coat rack is terrible. 1st off they sent me the wrong color. They sent natural coffee color instead of the oak finish. 2nd off the coat rack fell over and all 3 feet broke off, spliting the wood so it was unrepairable. This item is cheaply made and did not even last a whole month before breaking. Trust me, do not waste your money."
1,Terrible,"Fell over all the time! Then broke a leg 2 weeks later, useless terrible garbage.dont waste your money. Seriously, junk."
3,You Get What You Pay For...,"This coat/hat rack is tall and looks just like the picture provided. The wood is solid and has some good heft to it. However, the central post comes in three separate pieces and mine would not screw on completely straight. Instead, each section of the post is about a half millimeter off the one beneath it so that the it looks sort of like this: -_-Okay, I know that wasn't the greatest illustration, but that's the best I could do.The bottom legs' joints were also a bit long so that the wood piece that screws into the bottom of the post to secure the legs would not screw in all the way.It's all still perfectly functional and not bad looking, especially from far away. So, I'm going to say you get what you pay for. It's a relatively cheap rack and thus equally cheap construction."
2,Unstable base,"The wood is plenty nice looking. However, the base for the coat tree is unstable. The whole things falls over easily. Within 2 minutes of putting this together, wooden slit @ the base where the foot attaches cracked on both sides. I returned the product the same day I bought it."
1,Be prepared to get your Elmer's wood glue out,Before I had even finished assembling this product the base split putting one of the legs on. I used wood glue and finished assembling the next day. After finishing the assembly and placing in the foyer with the hats and coats on another split occurred. Now I am going to glue all three legs to the base. Thank goodness for Elmer's ! The low price is evidence of the quality.........however due to a Master Gluer at work this guy may stand on his own yet !
1,review hat rack,"I ordered two hat racks in a darker oak finish. One was in perfect condition, but the other was weak, splintered, and not acceptable. The company sent a replacement product that was in a much lighter oak finish. I give up. I would never go back to this company or purchase any product with their name to it. Substandard product and lousy customer service. Prompt reply did not mean customer care or satisfaction."
3,Coat Tree,"The coat tree is pretty, however, one of the wooden pegs that hold up the coats broke on the first night I used it. It was not a heavy coat, it was a light jacket. About a week after I got it, the top section that screws in to the lower section cracked. Again, it did not have an excess of weight that it had to hold, and it was not tightened too tight to make it crack. Maybe I just got a really bad one. I almost wrote to ask for another one, but it wasn't worth the shipping I would probably have to pay. It was shipped very quickly, so the seller was good in that regard."
2,Good product for price,"We enjoy this coat rack. It is pretty stable, seems durable, and can hold many coats, jackets, and sweaters. I even put my purse on it. Would recommend, especially since the price now is a few dollars cheaper than when I purchased it.*edited: This broke. I wouldn't recommend it. Spend a few dollars more for a coat rack that is more stable and doesn't tip over when holding coats."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The item arrived with no instructions but assembly was a snap. After all the pieces were screwed on, the rack was looked very nice. After I put 2 winter coats on it, the bottom literally splinted and broke before my eyes and the rack fell over. Spend an extra $25 and get a good-solid metal one which is what I intend to do right after I click submit for this review."
1,Missing Critical Parts!,"The box arrived well packaged. Has a nice smooth finish and is well built. Unfortunately, it is practically unusable as a coat/hat hanger. Its missing all the parts that you hang (stuff) on to (Part B, all pieces missing). ;-("
3,Coat Hat Rack Stand,"I purchased this product for my bedroom. We wanted it to hang our robes on. Upon opening the box, we were disappointed with the quality of it. When we attached the pegs that hold your coats, or whatever you wish to hang on them, they did not line up correctly. They finally did screw in all the way, but look cheesy when all assembled. The holes are very evident after being assembled. We hope that it will hold up for awhile, at least. It would not hold up to being used for heavy coats at all. Maybe light jackets. Not good quality for the price. We are not real happy with this purchase, but decided to keep it instead of returning it."
4,Very sturdy,I bought this back in January and it is still standing. I had up to 10 coats on it at a time and it still held. Very sturdy and came nicely shipped and is very practical especially for a dorm room.
1,Broke,"The rack broke at the base after having it for a week, granted there were several heavy winter coats. Still disappointed in the quality but not the money lost."
2,Poor quality,"At first glance, this coat rack was exactly what I wanted. It was a traditional design, lovely color, and not too expensive. However, when I received the item and opened the packaging, it already had scratches on it! Then, as I was putting it together (according to the instructions provided), the base cracked. I am returning this item."
3,Simple,"Its ook lighter in person than in the picture, bought this for my granny as a x-mas gift ummmm its just ook"
2,"Alright as background music, but it really cut it","This is alright music for background during Christmas parties, but when you listen closely there is nothing technically great going on here, just simple music played in the simplest way. A little mundane for my tastes, however fans of easy listening and elevator music may enjoy this as background music to be talked over."
1,Too bad Chris Rice doesn;t have a clue about Christmas music,"Chris Rice can't touch these Christmas songs, he is a horrible musician, and this is a horrible cd, the WORST christmas cd ever!!! In Poland, we don't like Chris Rice at all, we don't stand for bad musicianship here. A bad cd, don't buy it PLEASE i beg you. you just end up throwing it away anyways."
4,Chris did a good job of bringing Christmas memories to us,"Our local radio station keep playing cuts of songs by Chris Rice and I keep on hearing a sound that I enjoyed hearing time after time again, so I decided to jump on the bandwgon and buy one of his cds. Well the verdict is in and i'm pleased.For a moment I would like for you to imagine what Christmas would be like without the beautiful tunes that tell it's marvelous story. I fear that Chritmas would be very dreary without it's wonderful story of song.For this project Chris a pretty good job with his piano. I do however feel like he should have used a little more complex approach to these arrangments. The arrangements as they stand are a little weak. I feel they need a little more pep. Even at this present level this cd is not too far from being great.As far as the repertoure goes, it was a great one. I really liked the songs performed. They were all my personal favorites.Do yourself a favor and add this cd to your other Christmas cds."
4,Great indie music,"Don't shy away, listen, and listen again, let it seep into your special place for music. It's acoustic and creative."
4,Simply Beautiful,"Just happened to listen to this right after ""Four for Trane"". A stark contrast to that CD, this REALLY IS a series of ballads performed beautifully by Mr. Shepp and his band. The feel of this album is what one would expect from a ""ballads"" compilation, but there is no lack of inspiration. The whole band remains focused throughout, and they put enormous effort into every phrase.Highly recommended."
2,Hogue faulty for 1st time,Over the years I have purchased several Hogue Monogrips and this is the first time it did not fit properly. I have a Taurus model 851 revolver and the grip would not fit until I removed the washer from the screw. When you do this the head of the screw digs into the rubber and will not hold securely. I am now stuck with a grip that I cannot use on the revolver I have.
5,Perfect fit,"The new handle was perfect. Much better then the stock handle.It was very easy to install and came with very good instructions.My wife, who just started shooting, even mentioned that she will most likely like shooting it better now that it has the larger handle."
5,great product,"grips fit perfect,wish i would have got these when i was seven years old.okay good by,have a good day by."
3,Hogue rubber mono grip for Taurus 85,"There was a pin missing from this product. I called Hogue and they said I needed to use the pin that originally came with the revolver... Well, there is no pin with this gun. I had to go out and buy a pin at a hardware store.I'm not ever buying another Hogue product again!"
2,Hogue has Quality Control Problems,"I bought 2 grips for a Taurus 357 mag. and a model 85 38 special.The 357 was just as good as expected,however the grip for the model 85 did not have a small stirrup pin included with it.I sent it back to Amazon and it was replaced with another package and no stirrup pin.So I then got a refund.Also I contacted Hogue and asked for the part.They sent me a stirrup and sure enough no stirrup pin.I will look elsewhere for pistol grips"
5,paris,"Great album, I have played this over and over it never goes of date, I only wish there was a part two!"
1,Misleading,I was very disappointed in this book. The information I read on the back cover was not what was actually presented in the book. Do not waste your money.
5,Pokemon Postcard Book,"These cute, colorful postcards make writing letters more fun. They can expand ideas of what you want to say or just make your writing more figurative! They'll probably make a Pokemon Postcards 2, so if you like this look for that, or maybe you'd like a Pokemon Sticker Book or Let's Find Pokemon!"
4,Good selection,"There's a good selection of cards here. The cards are of light quality though. Not the same thickness as most postcards nowadays. There's four on a ""page"" so that means you will have the little perforated edges on two sides of the cards."
4,I hope you like pink....,"There are several different ways to approach a book about color, and this one takes a fun, rhyming way! Each page has two lines of text, the last line rhymes with the last line of the next page, making each ""verse"" 4 lines long. The lines are illustrated with bright, close photographs, including a pink ballerina, a pink piggy bank and a pink pile of candy hearts. Almost every page has a small fact box with additional information about what is described on the page (e.g. cotton candy used to be called fairy floss). Though not directly in the way, and quite interesting, I would have preferred these not to be in the middle of the story. There is also a glossary, a ""read more"" section, Internet sites and an index. Overall a good book (and series) and useful for storytimes, classrooms and solo reading."
2,Paper Tray Does not Work,"I bought this printer with the intent of using it for business documents and printing design drawings that are 36x24 inch on the roll feed. Forget it. The roll feed works great, but after having them ship me two replacement printers, I gave up on using the paper tray. This printer will not pick up paper from the paper tray without jamming the printer. Keep in mind they REPLACED my printer twice and it still doesn't work. I did find HPs phone support to be outstanding, but after several hours on the phone trying to troubleshoot this monster I could not give it any more time.I now use the printer for its roll feed to do the drawings, but have a different printer to do the 8-1/2x11 to 11x17 documents.What a disappointment to pay $1450 and not get what was advertised."
1,A ridiculous thesis that furthers euro-centricism,"Jensen's thesis is that the concepts that later Neo-Confucianist scholars and philosophers attribute to him are later interpolations of Jesuit missionaries is insulting and inaccurate.One need only read the court documents from the Tang dynasty (618 to 907 CE), far before any missionaries (except Buddhist missionaries from India) travelled to the lands of China, to see the monumental impact that the ideas of Confucius had on imperial Chinese culture.This should go along side the many texts of historical revisionism (such as those scholars who believed the Jewish Holocaust never occured).If you want to read the truth regarding Confucianism read professor Wing-Tsit Chan's"
4,Warning item pictured is not what you get,"Ordered from gigabargain and the item was not the same model as shown in picture (gigabargain did not take responsibility for it, and blamed Amazon for the picture).The one pictured is a much better lens than what (at least) Gigabargain is selling.Waste of 49.00 for me.The lens in the picture is a really good lens however and is what my rating comes from.C"
5,Great Gadget!,"I bought this camera to record our daughter's first Christmas. We wanted the flexibility to take both stills and video. The camera has far exceeded our expectations with regards to its video quality and ease of use. However, we are still trying to maximize the quality of the still photography. I am hoping it is just a goofed up setting somewhere. I will say that I have never owned something that turned more heads. I took the camera to a college basketball game and had multiple people approach me to find out what the hell I was using. I would recommend this camera for the following reasons:1. Video quality2. Ease of use3. Well priced4. Coolness factor5. Flexibility"
5,very cool,"I bought this camera over 2 weeks back and its been working so well for me so far that I had to write this review! Its really a cool looking gadget that works even better, still pictures are as good as other Sony ones and the print outs are awesome at 8 x 10 size BUT the mpeg4 is really something to show off.I have owned Panasonic Dsnap ones in the past just because I have always wanted something that would take pictures and serve as a camcorder too, the Dsnap quality doesnt even come close to this Sony M1.I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definately recommend this to anyone who is on the go like me or going on vacation etc so that they dont have to carry digital camera and bulky camcorder seperatley. Buy this eye-catching camera, it fits in the pocket and yet is too good at its job!"
5,sony cybershot DSCM1,"The sony cybershot is fairly easy to use as camera's go. This was my first ""real"" camera and in no time i was taking ""PRO"" shots. The way it opens up is a real ""grabber "" for me. The screen rotates ""360"" for easy self portraits."
3,fairly good camera,"This one replaced the DSCT-1 I had because the screen had cracked and the cost of repairs was equal to the cost of replacement. The other reviews of the M-1 are accurate. The major problem I found was the ""upgrade"" to MPEG4 videos. Yes, they are better, but they are, also, useless to send in e-mails because the recipents would have to have MPEG4 software in the computers to play them, and to quote another reviewer, ""What's the point of shooting video if you can't e-mail it to friends&relatives."" I preferred the T-1!"
5,Fine Pocket Digital Camera/Camcorder,"A professional photographer I know showed me her Sony Cybershot DSCM1 5MP digital camera at a photo gallery opening recently. I was quite impressed that a camera that is as large as your typical cell phone can produce outstanding image quality. She mentioned that this has become her principal camera now, replacing her venerable Leica M 35mm rangefinder camera. I must credit both Sony and Carl Zeiss for producing this fine little camera, which I suspect will be an admirable digital camera replacement for those who've relied upon pocket point and shoot film cameras for much of their photography. I would say that the Carl Zeiss Vario Tessar lens compares quite favorably quality-wise with the Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar lenses I have seen for several film and digital Contax compact cameras."
1,Carbosticks,"Not any good for acoustic set's. One stick lasted a couple hours, the other about 2 days. May last longer used on electronic drums."
1,AWFUL!,"These sticks chew up easily during rimshots and cymbal work. That in itself is a deal breaker. Add to that poor balance, and vibration transmission and you have a total loser of a drum stick."
3,Decent overview,"At least Dick Clark cooperated with this, so you get his point of view. The author is unsparing about Clark's money making ways, but the book is a bit too padded with historical perspective about what was happening in America when this TV show ruled the airwaves. If you've watched the show - and it's been hard to miss for many decades - then this music bio/history will fill in the background. It's just not as well written, or richly nuanced, as it could have been."
1,Tough to get through,"This is a very tough book to read as the author seems only to list endless, meaningless, facts without organizing them in to an interesting narrative. The role American Bandstand and Dick Clark played in the early days of television and rock 'n roll is a very interesting story. Unfortuneately this book fails to tell it an enjoyable way. Also, the author seems to have an unjustified vendetta against Clark."
5,Hilarious stories for kids who love to laugh,"My kids are in high school and they still remember the antics of the Golly sisters, siblings with funny adventures and fancy dreams! Along with Amelia Bedelia books, the Golly sisters encouraged my kids to begin reading at a very early age just to relive the antics on their own without Mommy's help. Highly recommend the Golly sisters with a whoop and a holler!"
5,Great for Kid and Adult !!,"My son and I have been reading ""The Golly Sisters"" books as part of his nightly first grade home reading. They are very entertaining, easy for a young reader, and wonderful illustrations. He enjoys reading them over and over and as a parent I don't mind listening again.They are delightful characters who find themselves in such unique and Hilarious situations with their horse and wagon. These are not like other sappy kid books,... very clever!!!!!"
4,"A wonderful find, if you can find it.","I stumbled upon Curtain Society much like you stumble upon most great bands, by complete accident. Being a west coaster, I never heard of this noise-pop group that churns out gut wrenching melodies the likes of adorable and slowdive (though not half as British.) As well, their distrubution doesn't quite make it out to Washington state. But once I heard the first couple of tracks from this album, I knew I had discovered a great addition to my CD collection. Check them out before they blow up and you're just a follower."
2,Noisy,Music is not well done and it's so noisy when the carousel turns that it drowns out the music. Will be returning the product.
2,disappointed,It was much smaller & chincier than I expected. I expected a much larger & bettter made product. Have seen much better products.
2,stopped working within weeks,"We bought this music box for our granddaughters to use as bedtime music. Their mother put it on a shelf and turned it on at ""lights out"". The unit inexplicably stopped working within 3 weeks. It had not been touched except to turn it on -- the girls have no way of reaching it. They loved it for the time it worked, and want another one, as their friend has had one for 2 years and had no problem with it. Buyer beware and keep receipts for possible return. Fortunately we purchased through Amazon, which is cooperating with us in resolving this problem."
2,Not worth the price,"When we received this item, it seemed very poor quality. Cheaply made, even. Mirror pieces were off centered, one was missing entirely- not even fell off during shipping, just not there at all. There were strands of what seemed like hot glue from attaching pieces between several carousel figures. This shoddy construction does not justify the price, and we are returning it."
2,Music stopped in 2 months,My grandson loves this carousel and goes to sleep by it every night when he visits us. He especially liked the different everyday tunes along with the Christmas tunes. The music inexplicably stopped with 3 months use. No guarantee on it because we misplaced the receipt and had thrown away the box after a few weeks. The construction for the $130 it cost is cheap. Buyer beware.
2,Gold Lavel Animated Musical Carousel,This was listed as new but it was not new. The packaging was partly missing (I have the complete one and bought this for a friend). The regular songs do not play but the Christmas ones do. I notified the seller but heard nothing back.The music box was mailed in it's box and not packaged into another box. Very disappointed in the gift I was so excited to give. Would never buy from Mr. Christmas again!!!
2,Ugh.,"I try to have a lot of tolerance for bad music, but this... oh, man. Their worst song is ""Snake"", it sounds like they're DRUNK. Their voices are horribly out of sync, and it just totally destroyed the music. I listen to black metal, gothic, I hear the hardest stuff on the planet, but this garbage just makes my ears bleed."
2,goth yodels,"When merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from Switchblade Syphony, one can only be disappointed in Diva Destruction's music. The positive aspect is the better production on this CD compared to their debut."
2,Works good at first,"I bought this for my Ram 2500 that was in need of some new wipers. They installed easily enough and seemed to do the job fine at first. Less than a month and very mild use, I began to notice them starting to skip across the windshield even when it was very wet. I pulled them off and noticed that all the joints were very flimsy and this was causing the problem. I guess you get what you pay for because these are cheap."
3,"Prima and Maione swing through peppy ""Poppins"" score","This 1965 curio arrived on CD as part of Disney's short-lived Archive Collection in 1998, and though officially out-of-print, it's still plentiful if you know where to look (there are tonnes of ""cut-out"" copies floating around). This is a charming album for ""Mary Poppins"" fans and jazz collectors alike.Louis Prima and his then-wife Gia Maione teamed their talents for this jazz/swing re-imagining of the MARY POPPINS score. The album as a whole is fun, with the emphasis naturally on the upbeat with such tunes as ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"" and ""Step in Time""; yet the crown jewel of the set is Prima's beautifully poetic treatment of ""Feed the Birds"".Gia Maione has a charming if basic voice. She doesn't have the biggest range but serves the material well; her best number on the album is ""Sister Suffragette"".Fun fun fun!"
2,It's very clear to see.,"This old Disney album features Louis Prima and his last wife, Gia Maione, singing songs fromMary Poppins. Unfortunately, most of these songs don't translate well to Prima's style of singing. And while Maione could carry a tune, her singing style wasn't very exciting. This is just a curiosity for collectors of Disney music."
5,"Innacurate Description, Know your USE!","This CBL-SFF8087OCF-05M is a forward cable. This means it is intended for the interface card to have the SFF-8087 connector and to breakout FORWARD to mulitple SATA drives.Be careful when purchasing, there are two types of breakout cable.Use this cable to go from the RAID card (like a 3ware 9650SE-12ML) directly to a drive.DO NOT Use this cable to go from a back-plane to the RAID card, that is a REVERSE cable."
4,Nice cables,Works great with my LSI 9260-4i. Nice durable cables. Feels sturdy and well made. I wish the price was cheaper tho.
3,Works,This item works as describes but lacks the latching clips on the drive ends. With time I have to keep pushing the connectors back onto the drive. So unnecessary.
4,"Super fun, but watch out for little brothers.....","Super fun for Tinkerbell lovers!! There are 2 tiny teacups shaped like flowers with a teapot to match - just the perfect size for the Tinkerbell doll (and for my girl's little brother to poke up his nose - ewwwww, watch those!) The only minus is the ""vine"" used as a ""seatbelt"" to hold Tink on Brother Dove's back is too short, and fits around her knees when she's sitting in the flower ""saddle"". But my 5 year old doesn't care,"
1,"Wow, how can anyone actually read this book!?","All I can say is, when you enter an area and the book tells you to go left, when infact you should be going to the right.. that is a problem. This book is a waste of money.. get the Dimension Publishing Wild Arms guide... it's much nicer, completely detailed (maps too ;) and more worth your money."
2,Get an online FAQ instead,"I'm not sure what book this other reviewer is raving about, but it can't possibly be about this one because it isn't a ""fantasy book"" - it's a guide to the Wild Arms Playstation game. Anyway, the book isn't terrible - it has a useful walkthrough to get you through the game. But I thought it was misleading when the title said ""Unauthorized Game Secrets"" and I didn't find any secrets in the book at all. Just a walkthough and monster list - things I can easily get online for free. You're better off saving yourself some cash and get the info online."
3,A decent book for beginning researchers,"If you are learning about complexity theory for the first time, I recommend you read Papadimitriou's excellent book on the subject. One aspect about this book that I did not like is it's lack of combinatorial analysis, and its more generic, structural apporoach (i.e. focusing on robust sets of problems). Some may prefer this, but I think the combinatorial approach is more in line with mainstream computer science."
5,Works fine in my jeep,This was cheaper and looks much better designed than the jeep one. Seems to work fine so far. Only time will tell.
4,Works but be careful,I purchased this item to replace the pump in my 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse. I needed to replace the pump for my front windshield so i bought this. Well it doesn't state anywhere that this pump is for the rear windshield and there is another part number for the front windshield. Trico 11-603 is for the the front windshield.So please note that. Don't make the same mistake i did.
2,Phone case,The case is nice. Fits well. The swivel belt clip sucksDoes anyone know of a similar case with a regular belt clip
4,a poignant story.,"I think ""White Tigers"" of The Woman Warrior is a poignant story. The thing that was the saddest to me was that she chose to sacrifice being with her family for 15 years but I think it was worth it because she could now defend her family."
4,LOVE this book!,I reread this last month and still found it a very entertaining. Things are a a little different now for Asian Americans in California but it's good for perspective.
1,Take your time and read something else,This book opens up strongly enough. The visual images and the story at first propels and urges the reader to continue. Then it drops dead. On or around the 70th page the book begins to get repetitive and useless. The images of white people as ghost is weak. The connections drawn amoung social classes and class consciousness is useless. For the time it takes to read the book and the effort a different book on this same subject material would be advised.
2,"Worth the Read, but not Again","Because of the title I orderd this book. I thought it was to be about War and Immigration, and yet it was half that. I thought M.H.K. covered too much in to little time. I would've liked to have her explain in depth a little more insted of rush right into the next sentence or paragraph. Although it is worth the read, it isn't something you should spend your spare time on."
1,I wouldn't even give it a one....,"My ninth grade english teacher made me read Woman Warrior this year. I do not understand how so many people found this book to be interesting in the least....In fact using the words irksome and tiring would be the best way to describe this book. I found it to be quite dull and incomprehensible at times, and I do not appreciate my english teacher for making me read it. The author's depiction of chinese men as being bossy and sexist is not, as far as know, accurate. I would not recommend this book to ANYONE. Please save yourself the anguish!"
1,The worst of the worst,"This is simply a terrible book. Including myself, my poor Ashley had to read it and suffer the horrible stories contained in this book. To put it simply, all Kingston does is continuously insult non-Chinese people and spread ideals that should have been lost in the void of time. She also continuously complains about America, without any ideas for fixing her ""problems."" The story has no sense of organization, purpose or time. It continuously jumps around a terribly written story that noone could make heads or tails with. This book is not worth the $8.80 or even a blue light special at K-Mart, with mail-in rebates for the entire prce. Infact, people should be paid to read this book. Nonetheless, even with ANY knowledge of the Chinese culture, all this book paints is propaganda for barbarians.Frankly, I'd rather stuff wild weasles down my pants."
2,A Driveling Story of Self Pity,"Despite my profound love of literature, I could not bring myself to enjoy ""The Woman Warrior"". The monotonous writing style as well as the bland anecdotes did nothing but block me off from being immersed from the story. I felt myself yawning everytime I had to start a new chapter, and would have been estatic when I finished the book had I contained the energy to feel in such a way. I closed the book feeling drained, bored, tired, and unfulfilled. And if that was what I was aiming for while I read, I wouldn't enjoy the skill at all."
3,"the book needed a little help, but it wasn't too bad.",I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK FOR MY ATL CLASS AND IT WAS OK. IT SEEMED MORE LIKE A MOVIE THAN IT DID ANYTHING ELSE. I WENT AND SEEN KINGSTON TALK AND I THINK READING HER BOOK WAS A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.
3,difficult to sit through,"The Woman Warrior had a captivating beginning, but it was very difficult to finish. The writing style was clear and simple, but little action took place throughout the length of the novel. I finished it not really understanding the ending because very little happened. Some sections were interesting, however, but as a whole, the novel was not very engaging."
5,The first of this genre,"I didn't know beans about Chinese women when a friend put this book into my hands about 20+ years ago. Talk about a revelation. The Woman Warrior preceded Amy Tan's novels by at least a decade and went on to win several awards. It's about growing up Chinese American in California's Central Valley, working in the family laundry, and having to listen to her mother's stories that were designed to scare her into ""good behavior."" Some of these ""talk stories"" depicted women as fierce and strong warriors, while at the same time they were enslaved by their culture.This memoir is intense, mystical, introspective, and full of marvelous and unexpected twists and turns. If you haven't yet read it, now's your chance."
4,A girl trying to survive chinese culture,"The Woman Warrior tells of a chinese girl who comes to America with her family. Despite being in a new country she must deal with the old traditions from her homeland. Her parents were brought up in a country in which it is better to raise geese than girls. If you enjoy a book with dramatic events and suspense than don't read this book. If you like a book which nicely portrays the depth of its characters than by all means, read this book."
5,Remarkable Tale by a Woman of Insight,"I was very moved by this account of immigrant Chinese family life and a young girl's internal struggle. Maxine Hong Kingston has established herself as the leading Asian-American woman writer of enduring, serious fiction. The only other writer I find that comes close is a Chinese woman writer living in the U.S. who writes in Chinese. That writer, Geling Yan, recently published an English-language book called ""White Snake and Other Stories."" I think Maxine Hong Kingston and Geling Yan, coming at similar circumstances from different directions, are the shining lights of Chinese-American women's fiction in our generation."
4,"Absorbing, moving and very personal tale","Judging by the extremes of the other reader comments, it appears that this book is either very much your cup of tea or absolutely not - there's not much in between. However, given that most of the negative (and, tellingly, ungrammatical and misspelt) comments seem to come from school students, this is perhaps understandable. I remember having D.H. Lawrence's 'Sons and Lovers' forced on me at school and loathing it. I guess the moral is that this is not a book for teenagers -- it's rather too deep; I almost certainly wouldn't have enjoyed it myself at that age. However, for anyone who has spent any time abroad, or has any interest in Chinese culture it will be a fascinating and moving experience. If you like this, you might want to try 'Talking to High Monks in the Snow' by Lydia Minatoya, which covers a similar theme but from a Japanese-American point of view."
1,The Woman Warrior,"Do not waste your time to read it. I should give this book 0 star, no matter what kind of rewards this book got."
4,women warrior,"The book by Maxine Kinston is based on five different stories about different Chinese women. The novel is filled with Chinese folktales and culture. This is a story that one as a Chinese or any other culture could relate to because throughout the novel shows ancestry and tales about myths and legends. The novel will take you through stories of deception and haunt that is told through the eyes of Kingston herself. Starting with long lost aunts followed by so-called ghost warriors and ending with stories about her mother's life back in china; this book will keep you reading until the end. I recommend this story to anyone who is interested in story tale and culture of a different sort, that of Chinese. I enjoyed reading the novel myself and it kept me reading in interest on the twist and turns of Kingston's life."
3,Only read it if you have to.,"This isn't a memoir, it is just a bunch of crappy stories. Some parts are entertaining and well written, others leave you wishing you were reading something else. Most of my classmates found it pretty crappy. If you aren't force to read it for a class, spend your time on something else."
1,Infuriating,"I don't know about everyone else, but I don't like reading novels that anger me. I had to read this for a class and absolutely hated it. Avoid it if you want to sleep after reading."
2,Boring book don't read it unless you have to!!!!,This book is boring and bad. It is about a girls daydreaming and one has trouble trying not to daydream with this book. I had enough by page 10 but because of school kept reading. This book is not worth my two cents.
4,Cofusing yet shows the importance of an ethnic background,"After reading this book, I found that it was quite confusing because it was not chronological and skipped around a lot. This book also got its point across about immigrants and the need for a person to have an ethnic background. As a 9th grade student, I found this book to be challenging since there were so many metaphors and images that were hard to grasp"
2,"Don't waste your time with the book, watch Mulan.","I'm not going to recommend this book to anyone, at least not any of my friends. If you are interested in reading about the Chinese culture go ahead and read it. But if I were you I would just watch the Disney movie Mulan. The following quote from the book is mainly what it is all about, the Chinese woman. ""Families are glad to be rid of daughters. Girls are like maggots in rice. It's more profitable to raise geese than daughters."" All throughout the book the Chinese women struggle and it is made clear that women aren't valued in their culture. You will all have a better time watching the movie Mulan and you will get the same thing out of the movie that you do from the book, women have to work a lot harder than men do to be respected in their culture. The best part in the book is the second story, White Tiger. It has most of the action in the book and it is just like the movie Mulan. So you should just watch the movie."
3,"Very readable, lots of great themes","I began reading Kingston's book thinking that I was going to absolutely hate it, but I really didn't. In fact, I found the book very enjoyable. It's very simply written and easy to read. As long as readers persist with trying to understand the chronology and the relationship between the portrayals of the different women, they will realize how wonderfully designed this work is. If you read this book, you must understand that even though she is speaking from the first person point of view, in many cases, it is not really her voice; rather, in a sophisticated narrative technique, she takes on the identities of her relatives and role models, perhaps to relate their experiences to her own. Readers should also pay close attention to ghosts. They play an extremely important role in the point of the stories. Overall, I think this book is certainly worth reading...it sends a good message about the human struggle."
1,Too much pretense to actually be decent,"This book was written just to jump on the bandwagon with Maya Angelou and Amy Tan. It was written in a popular style, about a popular topic (cultural diff. between America and China and the problems that arouse because of these differnces between the narrator and her mother). Full of pretence. Save your money."
2,"Well Written, Bad Representation","Although the book was written well, it does not represent Chinese. I couldn't get over the fact that Kingston made Mulan a victim of Chinese male misogyny. Look up the Ballad of Mulan yourself and see if there is anything about Mulan being abused. Bear in mind, Mulan never had a tattoo. And, the Chinese character for ""woman"" and ""slave"" are not the same. And, there is no ""forbidden stitch"" in Chinese literature. And, Kingston misuses the word ""ghost"".Many feminists like this book, but don't forget, Kingston is doing this in spite of Chinese people (specifically, males)! Sure, this isn't a book of history (Kingston says she is not perserving Chinese myths and fairy tales), but I don't think it's fair to ruin the Ballad of Mulan doing it and making up phony stories about Chinese. If anybody uses this book for a term paper or a dissertation, beware! You are using a book from an author who doesn't know Chinese literature."
2,"Well-written, but boring and mind-numbing.","I am a ninth grader (so you probably won't take me too serioiusly) and I just finished reading this book for school. I found it to be well-written, but it just couldn't keep my attention for long. I found it to be boring and all of the characters seemed to be in a strange mental state, especially the mother. Also, the book greatly confused me, espically the purpose of all the ghosts and the ""talk-story"" that her mother kept telling. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys contemplating the meaning of books for hours and getting really confused, but otherwise, it seems useless to read this book."
1,Waste of Time,"Kingston shouldn't have written a book about Chinese identity when she's not at all in touch with it. Her ""experiences"" are equivalent to those of a white man's claiming to be an exploited, underprivileged black woman. I dont' see why she got rave reviews, and I REALLY don't understand why her resentment for Chinese men makes her a ""feminist"" while Frank Chin's works challenging her false renderings of Chinese myth and history makes him a misogynist.A note to teachers: If you intend to endorse cultural sensitivity and understanding, Do not use this novel as a part of a ""minority"" or ""cultural"" unit. ""Woman Warrior"" is representative of a psychotic mind, and not of authentic Chinese culture."
3,Interesting but ultimately confusing,"This book is a very interesting memoir of Kingston's life and provides valuable information about the Chinese culture and the shock of adapting to a new country. Yet, it is very confusing and at times rambles on and on. The author switches narrators a couple times throughout the novel without alerting the reader. Also, a lot of speculation is made in this novel about the lives of her family. Seeing as she has no way of knowing, I disliked those parts as well. All in all it is an interesting read but don't expect too much."
1,A tale of total distortion,"I had to read this book for my English 11-AP class presentation. I picked the novel because I thought it would have interesting stories about my Chinese culture. Instead, I didn't find any! What myths she wrote about I knew and she completely distorted those myths into a vulgar, nonsensical mess. As a Chinese-American, I am horrified that such a book is out in America. It portrays the Chinese in an awful light that we don't need. If you haven't read this book yet, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."
4,A Woman Warrior: Review,"""A Woman Warrior"", by Maxine Hong Kingston opened our eyes to the traditional Chinese lifestyle and culture. It focuses on the tight family ties and strict values trying to maintain certain traditions in America, and expressing conflict between the races. ""A Woman Warrior"", demonstrates the horrible conditions that women had to overcome since birth. Not being wanted or desired, babies killed or stoned to death just to name a few. Once they began to grow, their feet were bound,and many other aspects to put them at the bottom of the social triangle. As far as the actual reading of ""Woman Warrior"", it moved slow, with too many details. The plot seemed to move in circles and be repetitive. However, this book was a cultural lesson and we now feel informed on the chinese values."
1,Irritating,"I was quite irritated by how Kingston seemingly tried to use Chinese mythology, but did not stay true to the story. I don't want to hear her life story! The only life story I would ever want to hear about would be of my own, my pet gerbil Foo-foo, and possibly the Dukes of Hazzard. I was forced to read this for a Writing class at UC Santa Cruz whose writing faculty most likely consists of a bunch of zit-brains. My suggestion to anyone who is required to read this book is to pretend you've read it and make stuff up as needed."
1,Poor Communication,"Books communicate. This book communicates very poorly. At first I thought it might be ""stream of consciousness"" but it kept on and on into such a jumble that I wanted to abandon it. But, it is on the College Boards list of books for college bound students so I plugged along. The stories in each chapter were interesting but the writing made me work for understanding rather than helping me understand. If you consider what the Chinese accomplished and are accomplishing in America, surely this portrayal can't be typical. Woman Warrior should be on the College Board reading list only as an example of poor writing."
4,The Woman Warrior,I think The Woman Warrior by Maxine Hong Kingston was a good book. I liked this book because it shows the adventures and the hard work the girl had to do in order to become a warrior. If i was her i would not have done the same thing she did and she left her parents to train and become a warrior. Throughout this whole book it makes me want to read for more because of the different training she must do. The author also describes the characters so good it makes me almost feel like i can see them right in front of my eyes. I think this book was a good book and it catches the readers eyes right from page one. I wold recommend this book to anyone.
2,I'm sure there are better books out there...,"I was forced to read this as a summer reading assignment for my AP English class last summer. I'm an avid reader and usually enjoy the assignment, but not this time. The plot and character development are truly lack luster in this novel. There is a surprising lack of insight in this book which makes reading this book an even more painful experience. I literally tossed the book into the swimming pool in disgust while reading it. I wish I knew of better books available about the Chinese-American experience, but I do not. I'm sorry, I hate to complain unless I've got something to sugest, but this time I cannot keep quiet. Avoid this literary disgrace if you can."
3,"A good, yet confusing piece of literature","I thoroughly enjoyed Kingston's novel about how difficult it was growing up Chinese-American in both time periods. If you're torn between a reading list for school, like I, think about reading this book. It's not the easiest book to understand, but will teach you something and help you to shape you opinions on certain criteria. I have only read this book once through, and probably won't read it a second time, but if you have to fully understand this novel, then I suggest you read it twice so that you can catch something if you missed it. It's not the best book that I have ever read, but it was enjoyable enough for school and for writing a report on."
3,The Woman Warrior a worthwhile read,"""And I have so many words-""Chink"" words and ""gook"" words too- that they do not fit on my skin."" I believe that this quote encompasses the meaning of the book. I found that most of the limitations of the book were in the way the author wrote it, and in the way it jumped between the past and the present. I enjoyed the way the author showed the difference between the Chinese and American cultures. I liked the book a lot. I thought that it was worth my time, and I might read it again."
2,"It was alright, but pretty confusing","I thought that The Woman Warrior was an okay book. I learned a lot about the Chinese culture. At first I was pretty interested but it took a little getting use to because it was told in a strange way. I thought it was kind of jumpy and hard to follow. Towards the end of the book it seemed to drag on, and it was tough to stay focused. There was a lot of stuff that I didn't know about the Chinese culture. I learned a lot about the beliefs and the way of life. I think the author did a great job expressing both of these aspects. I don't think I would read this book again, because it wasn't too interesting to me. But, anyone wanting to learn more about the Chinese way of life, this is a great source."
2,Random and boring,"I found this deplorable book to be a mesh of random occurences in the life of a young chinese american girl. The book has no uniformity and is confusing and boring. Also, there is absolutely no plot and no suspense. If you want a good and interesting read, do NOT buy this book. On the other hand, if you're looking for something with many ""hidden meanings"" and ""motifs"", but no relevance to anything whatsover- buy it."
1,Very boring and inconsistent novel,"I was practically fighting with this book, not wanting to read it, but I had to for my college english assignment. I found the book not interesting at all, and it took me forever to finish it. I didn't like how the author jumps from one place to another at all. I just don't think the transition from her life story to her tales was smooth at all. Thank God I finnally finished the book. Don't read it if you don't have to!!!!"
1,This book was horrible,"Although it is a uniquly written book with much to tell of life expieriences it had nothing interesting and involving. I cant think of a more boring book it has to top my list of books NOT to read, with Amy Tan's the Joy luck club right behind it."
3,"Back Off, All of You","It's hard to imagine that a book with a serious intent would be trashed by one group of readers and idealized by another. But that's American education today.If you back off from the politically correct nonsense and the right wing attackers, this book tries to explain what it is like to be a Chinese-American woman through mythic input, the realistic stories balanced against the Mul-lan legends. Like all great literature, it tells one part of the story. Do you really think sane, mature readers take this as the only truth of the Chinese diaspora?I learn something from every book, and, unfortunately, never everythng. Take this as part of the subjective truth of Chinese Women in immigration, and you can enjoy and learn from this novel. Or you can make a fuss about an evolution of cultures which will pass you by in any case."
3,exercise advice,The book arrived in great shape. The actual contents I have glanced at minimally. The line drawings were a real turnoff. It made it difficult for me to understand how to do some of the exercises.
3,Very Very Very Basic Info,"This book would be fine if you've never used a computer and know nothing about the Internet. Then, if that were the case you wouldn't be reading this.So, while the author is complimented for taking the time and effort to write this work, it does not seem that the information content is enough to justify the selling price.Hoped is that later revisions will have more useful content. For now, the book is inspirational in that it demonstrates that it can be done."
4,this is great!,"This easy to understand book is excellent for the internet sales newbie. Stephanne tells it just like you had sat down across from her desk and said ""I'm thinking about starting to try to make some money on the internet...what do you think I should do?"".It moves right along and gets straight to the point. I will refer back to it oftem!"
4,minor canopy issue,"The boning in the canopy is not supporting it properly when it is opened (or being used) however it still works, it just flops down on one side a bit. I believe it is an individual issue and probably not commonplace among these. I can easily fix it by replacing the boning. Other than that, It works great, fits my car seat (which wasn't one of the ones listed) and has a nice thick feel to it. The material is quality. I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Bob The Builder-Top Team,"I bought this for my 4 yr old son who is an avid Bob the Builder fan, and he loves it!! We watch it together...over and over......"
2,Please change the tiltle!,"...It is fair to say that the author has a good story to tell and gives a good description of USAF bomber crews during WWII. However he never saw a Lufwaffe fighter during all his raids and fails to give any credible explanation for this. Also there is not one thought for all the civilians that were killed during Allied bombings. Jackson's first missions were over France and although he does mention USAF bombing US army positions, there is nothing for instance on the bombing of Caen where 5000 French civilians were killed. Later during the bombings over Germany there is no mention on the death of hundreds of thousands of German civilians. ..."
4,"Ethereal, yet very listenable with pop overtones","This is my first experience with Siddal. They were recommended to me by a European e-mailpal who said that if I like Stereolab I might want to try Siddal, Tortoise, and the like. Siddal reminds me of early- to mid-career The Cure. Aside from the vocals, I suspect others will pick up on the layering and guitar-strumming-like effects and how much they remind one of the Cure and other Brit bands who surfed in to the US during the New Wave. A good mood CD to have around when you are feeling like no one understands you. Siddal does...."
5,impressive and compact introduction,This is a very nice and lovely done view into ancient craft. The tiny but nevertheless greatly powerful amulets give us an impression about their owners. After reading the book and consider the colourful pictures you feel very close with them.
3,It was ok,"I think this book didn't hold enough information. There should be more books about the same subjects, but with more info."
2,Out of date,"this is my own fault, I didn't read the publishing date before purchasing. It is old enough that it really isn't worth buying. Too much has changed since it was published. Internet reference books need to be current to be truly useful."
4,Maheu is a master,"Here's a guy who blows his life through his horn. ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee"" here touches the holy. The cost of the CD is worth it for this one alone."
4,Simply wonderful...,"Taped during her highly-evolved ""Post"" tour; highlights include ""Headphones, ""Hyper-ballad,"" & ""I Go Humble."""
3,Interesting,"I have 3 other DVD's of Bjork - Volumen, Greatest hits and Cambridge. These are absolutely brilliant. I was dissapointed with Shepherds Bush. My reasons are:1 The engineering of the sound is poor. Often I struggled to hear her voice over the instruments.2 The choice of instruments - even though bold and daring did not pull it off in my opinion. I much prefer the previous arrangements of these songs. Mind you the use of the piano accordion was very novel.Despite these negatives I still enjoyed this DVD. Had I not purchased the other Bjork DVD's I probably would have given this DVD a rating of 4.The 3 Bjork DVD's I own are truly special and perfect in every sense."
5,hmmmmmmmmmmm.,"Last time I checked, the book comes before the movie......so the movie would be the one changed, not the book.......correct me if I'm wrong......"
1,5 stars for the nostalgia - 1 for the contents!,"I was infatuated with Hayley when I was 13 and this was one of the first albums I ever bought. I found it a bit weird at the time, with its mix of classic numbers (Side By Side), 30's style throwbacks (Jeepers Creepers, Sentimental Sunday), ""rock'n'roll"" (Ding, Ding, Ding) and ""cute"" (Cranberry Bog, Jimmie Bean Song). Let's Get Together was great however!! But all are characterised by Hayley's total inability to sing a phrase in one breath, hold a tune, or inject any sort of personality into the music. The arrangements are ghastly. I've toyed with the idea of buying it for old time's sake, but basically, it's unlistenable! You can share her pain if you're brave enough to shell out for it."
1,1 broken on arrival,"Beware - whoever packs these does not care about obvious risk of something like this breaking. The box was thrown into a larger cardboard box with no padding at all. Extremely frustrating - and not worth going through the return, etc. I'm going to live with a set of 5."
3,"Nice, basic product","...but arrived with one ramekin broken. This item was packed safely enough, but it could not withstand the rigors of a trip on a USPS truck during Christmas week. In the future, I'll order something this fragile during a less hectic time for package deliveries or use an alternative carrier."
2,Not Broiler Safe - Made in China,"There are no use and care instructions included in the box. The BOX says Made in China. The bottom of the ramekins are just stamped: ""Una Porcelain by Norpro-Dishwasher, Microwave, Oven, & Freezer Safe."" (No oven temp limit is listed). I contacted the company and received the following information: ""Norpro Porcelain Ramekins are only heat resistant up to 392F/200C and are NOT safe for use under the broiler or with a culinary torch."" I guess they are still useful for 'mise en place' preparation (4 oz. ramekin measures 3 1/2"" x 1 5/8"") but look elsewhere if your needs are for higher heat resistance or something that is NOT made in China."
5,Nor Pro Porcelain Ramekins,"These are cute little ramekins. I use them for prep. Put chopped garlic, herbs etc. They are really handy for that. They are sturdy and well made. I haven't tried to make custard in them yet, but I am sure they will do just fine."
5,Great value for the price!,"I love these, they are just the right size and much cheaper than I had seen them in the store."
3,BROKEN,Purchased two sets of Norpro 6 piece Porcelain Ramekin Dishes. On arrival four of the twelve pieces were broken because of the way they were packaged. These are fragile and the pieces of thin cardboard used to separate the products cannot work. Amazon should ensure that these suppliers package their products properly. Also bought a Braun food processor which arrived in good condition FULLY intact because it was properly packaged.
2,broken,The reason I gabe 2 stars is because I am a little upset that one was broken when it got to me. These ramekins are also often used to make creme brulee but the company says they are not safe with torchea or under a broiler which are the only two ways to get a good topping to it. I personally used a torch anyways and they were fine and arent safe for temp over 350 in the oven i believe it was.
2,Should have looked closer,"These are MUCH smaller than I expected. I should have read the product description, because it clearly says .5 cups. I'd seen french onion soup served in bowls that look really similar to these, and it is hard to get a sense of the size of these by just looking at the picture. They looked ok, but they are completely unsuitable for soup. Frankly, I don't think you could serve much of a custard in them either. Condiments might work. I could see loading them up with blue cheese dressing and serving with a mess of buffalo wings, but that's about it."
4,Nice,"They are cute and do well in the oven. Good for my pumpkin custard. They are smaller than I thought they were, that's the only reason I gave 4 stars, but that is my own fault for not seriously looking at the measurements."
3,Small,These were much smaller than I expected. I should have read the description better. I would have bought a bigger sized set.
3,part of order broken,Two of the ramekins were broken when they arrived. Packaging could be much better. I needed the remainder for a gathering I was having and did not have time to get more before it so I didn't send the broken ones back.
5,Ramekins,"I ordered these little dishes for leftovers and my diet. They are so very handy as I cook. They come in handy when I want a small snack, too."
5,Ramekin Set is what I expect,"These are not extraordinary ramekins. What would extraordinary ramekins look like or do? These arrived intact, held my custard while cooking in water in the oven until done, cooled as expected, were attractive enough to use as single serving dishes and then cleaned easily and completely.What's not to like?"
5,great quality to go from freezer to hot oven,"i use these to make ""make ahead chocolate souffles"" from ATK's recipe, and these work really well. going from freezer to a hot oven is no problem, and these are the perfect portions not too big, not too small. i've also used them to make creme brulee and those turned out well too. i like them so much that i just bought another set as the soufflee recipe is too much for 6, now i can probably make 10 servings."
4,fast shipping...great product...low price,"Very pleasant experience. Product arrived earlier than expected. The chairs arrived in perfect condition - no shipping damage. They are easy to assemble and for the low price (about $40/chair when shipping cost is factored into the total price), they are very good quality. I bought a similar product several years ago from a local vendor at a cost of $60 per chair. I'm very pleased with this item and the expedient delivery."
1,Not good....,"Sorry Mr Georg, but you missed the boat with this offering. Truly disappointing, aside from the great illustrations by Mr. Shestakov, is all I can say about this book. Most of the pictures were of MODELS, yes, plastic models. It appears that the purpose of the book was not to inform, but to display the authors models and give the paint schemes for other modelers! The text is almost all speculative, and the entire book gives very little hard info. I was hoping for a definitive work on the interesting topic, but felt quite let down. Save your $38 plus shipping and buy something else......"
1,This is science-fiction!,"I do not pretend being a great specialist of WWII, but still I have some knowledge of history, and EVEN FOR ME it is clear, that this thing is pure fantasy. I bought it encouraged by the title and illustrations and I returned it some days after to the book club, at my own expense - I just didn't want to have this thing at home. The author should be ashamed - some people will read this book and some will even believe it, which will give them a false vision of history. DON'T BUY IT!"
2,Not easy for kids,"Although beautiful to look at, this book is VERY difficult to put together. It's listed as being for ages 4-8. NO WAY. Both my 8 year old granddaughter and I (Grandma) had a VERY difficult time cutting it out and putting it together."
1,Not worth it. I wouldn't buy another!!,"The activities in this book were nearly impossible to put together. We bought this for our [...] who loves the movie, but there's no way he could have done this alone. In fact, my husband and I could barely put the piece together neatly. It took superglue to hold the hold thing together. And although some pieces were made so you can punch them out of the book, the more difficult shapes, like the people and parts of the boat had to be cut out by hand. Needless to say, our end product didn't look all that great, and my son lost interest in the process as soon as he was unable to participate.I wouldn't recommend it at all."
4,Nice story about sugaring,This is not the complete book to maple syrup however there are some useful time lines and info. Mostly a story of collecting syrup.
5,Wonderful companion to Angel Cards,I am very impressed and satisfied with the Zen Cards. Pick one a day and in a short time you will be thinking like a Zen Master
2,Pretty Cards But No Instructions Leads to Confusion,"I got a set of these cards and they are beautifully done but the lack of directions leaves me stymied.To Daniel Levin: I don't know if my cards were just lacking the instructions or not, but any help would be appreciated. I read your review and you are not very specific about how to use these cards -- please help!"
3,"This book might help some, but not me","At times, this book was more complicated than my main textbook for the class. The practice problems in this textbook were actually way harder and more complicated than anything I came across on my exams. The way I would work through this class was read the chapter in my text book, then read this book for clarification. After 4-5 chapters, I realized I was ending more confused than I started and just quit reading it. I think it's really hard to buy a good supplement for your text book when every professor teaches organic chemistry differently. Maybe this will be great for you and the way your professor teaches...but it didn't work out well for my class. But I got an A, so I'm not too bummed out."
2,It didn't fit inside my saxophone :(,"When I got this cleaner, I had to remove part of it so that it would even begin to fit inside the instrument. Also, since it is not made of cloth, it gets jammed a lot in the saxophone, and it takes too long to clean the instrument."
3,Excellent movie - pity about the transfer.,The previous reviews have said all that I wanted to say except that this is one of my favourite movies and normally I would give it 5 stars. I live approx. 50km from where it was filmed and it shows the beauty of my little corner of the world perfectly.However I was very disappointed with the DVD transfer which is the worst I have ever seen. All movement in the film results in a mass of mpeg artifacts which reduces the image resolution to sub-VHS quality.
4,A rural tragedy,This a pleasant and moving little film. Its strong points are the sence of place and the landscape. The sountrack is the Lark Ascending by Vaughn Williams. Although English music it captures the feel of the Australian country side wonderfully.The hero of the film is a young boy of 15 who fall in love with an older girl from a poorer family. She is involved with an older kid who is always getting into trouble. The 15 year old watches the tragedy which unfolds from a distance. Around him live adults who have lived damaged lives.
3,Interesting Survey of Confederate Generals,"The familiar Gary Gallagher format, this one containing 8 articles by 8 historians, each of whom writes about one of the full Confederate generals, each choosing one about whom they are not considered to be an expert. As might be expected, the articles about the less well known generals, such as Edmund Kirby Smith and Samuel Cooper, are the most interesting to a Civil War buff, and worthwhile for that alone."
1,Don't waste your money,"This recording is flat and overall just lame. From an orchestral performance standpoint... it stinks. If you are looking for a good rendering of the antiphonal brass choirs, get the ozawa/boston symphony recording. It is truely antiphonal brass choirs. You can her the differance.."
4,"Well built and as pictured, though smells of plastic",Well made and colors are as pictured. Latch is a little tricky. Strong odor of plastic which starts to decreases with time.
3,"Box is nice on the inside, but a cheap latch ruins it for me.","Latch mechanism is very low quality and it took me almost 10 minutes to get it open. Also, the lock does not work, nor do I imagine it would deter anyone over the age of two for more than 3-4 second as I was able to pull mine open regardless with surprising ease."
2,box came locked,This product looks nice from the outside. It was delivered locked with no key. I don't know how to open without a key.
4,My first accessories case.,"Good for beginner watch collectors. The only problem is that the cufflinks area doesn't hold more than three sets. Which is okay, but I assumed it would hold more from the picture. This was purely my fault. It also has a lock like the ones that come on suitcases. All in all good product."
5,Very Nice,"Very nice case for not only watches, but also has compartments for cuff links and other items, cash, tie clasps, etc. The material has the perfect amount of softness to not scratch up the watches or other stuff. It's not going to fit 5 45 watches comfortably, but will work great for 5 slightly smaller size watches. I have 3 45 and 2 40 sizes and it works fine for me. Plus for the great price, I would definitely recommend this box over others on Amazon."
5,Great product!,"Although the box is small, it is really nice for my items and at a good price. I would recommend it!"
4,Mens Watch Box,"Beautiful product, great price, lock did not work but do not have time to send it back before the holiday."
5,Excellent Customer Service,"After I placed the order I noticed it said the item was blue, not what we wanted so I was going to cancel the order. The seller contacted me and asked if they have the red available do I still want the car otherwise they would be happy to refund me the purchase. They had the red and it arrived well before Christmas so my Grandson had his new car, just like his Grandpa's."
2,Disappointed...,"She is supposed to sound a lot like Vanessa Carlton, Tori Amos, Jewel and Fiona Apple in a mixture. She plays piano- driven melodies but obviously is not too famous yet. I finally got to hear her online and I must say she was kind of a disappointment. The songs I heard from her did not sound too good and she really does not even go near Vanessa Carlton. She sounds somewhat like Jewel but no I did not like the sound of her. Others into piano- driven musicians may love her, but I did not personally."
4,Good Product,I received everything I ordered. Would recommend this product to anyone. It is probably the cheapest value plus you don't have to pay for gas to go get it so even if it cost the same at your local music store you will still save some money.
5,I very much recommend this book,"It's a fun, easy read and you get something out of it. I could totally relate to so many scenarios too, especially the one about being up at 3:00 in the moring and then the father/daughter part. Everyone should read this book."
2,Book is falling apart,"I'm a few chapters in. The information seems to work out ok, more examples would be nice. I bought this brand new and its already falling apart :( I tried to flatten a section to get it to stay open and the binder glue is letting go, now I have pages on the verge of falling out. Sad construction."
4,Nothing bad to say,I have nothing bad to say about the service or product I received. Everything was in order.
4,"Pretty functional, a little bulky","Got this a couple weeks ago. The rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so I am confident that I won't be getting any scratched. And it flips open a ok. You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched. You can't access the TF card.There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isn't going to fall out.3 minor qualms: The see through plastic has a little glare on it, especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suit. Also, it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock. (noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt). Last, the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera. You already know the v710's camera is crap for its specs, but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap. I got used to it real quick."
4,Defenitely not Prada,"I Just want to make something clear...the windbreaker is NOT Prada, the tag reads MIU MIU, a very good brand, but definetely not Prada. I found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket. I layered it with a black Yohi Yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect..."
3,content good but....,"I like the content of the book as it kept to what it advertised, that is it focused on the social, morale, and emotional decisions that must be made to implement genetic technologies into a democratic society. The points were well covered and unambiguous.However I was definitly not pleased with the propensity towards extreme repetition. The same good ideas cycled through the book over and over again. This bothered me enough that I question the writer's motivation behind writing the book. Hopefully we're not just out there to fulfill our writing contracts? It makes for poor results."
5,Cautious and responsible,"This is a credible and sober work. Kitcher considers the expansion of gene- testing which is about to come , and its implications. He relates primarily to 'negative eugenics ' and the possibility of preventing disease and human suffering. He does not really speak about the more fantastic kinds of ' genetic engineering ' which would enhance humans.The work was published ten years ago, and there has been great scientific progress in this time, including the mapping of the human genome. But most of the problems and questions here are still of great importance. And this book can provide valuable insight into them."
5,amazing mix for kids and adults alike,"This mix is catchy and familiar... those old wholesome tunes from our childhood... kids and adults both love it! (I often find myself putting it on even when the kids aren't home!) Of our entire music collection (and it's pretty extensive), this is the kids' most loved."
5,Great children's CD,My sister and I had this record growing up and we would listen to it on road trips with our parents all the time. I remember most of the words and I love being able to share these timeless songs with my 16-month-old son. He's already singing along even though he can't say the words yet! I definitely recommend this CD (and the others in the series) for all children!
4,Good songs,Songs are great. it's a little slow for my kids. They loves the the beats. But they still love to listen to this CD.
3,Walt Disney CD: Characters Do Not Sing,"I'm a little disappointed. I purchased this CD thinking The Disney Characters would be singing the songs. My son was all excited when I showed him the CD and asked me to play it. When he heard it he said ""this is not Mickey Mouse"". He was very sad. The songs on this CD are sung by children. The CD is ok."
1,Not my type of disney... :(,I am a huge disney fan and collector. I have the other cd's from baby einstein to the cd of songs from the movies and my whole family loves them. This cd was recorded in 1979! It is a old man whom I don't find very pleasant. I prefer the 'normal' childrens cd's. I bought this cd and returned it within 15 minutes.
5,The hot new star Joshua Jackson ! !,I think this book was great because it brought out a lot in his home life as well as his personal life. I kno we all love gossip gals! ! I also think Josh Is the HOTTEST guy on the planet and that also makes this book great ! ! !
2,Broke right away.,"It was a little difficult to figure out how to take it apart to get the batteries in, and the light never would come on. It is made cheaply of plastic parts. However, my son didn't seem to mind that it wouldn't light up and loves it anyway. It looks pretty good, just doesn't light up."
1,MY SWORD WAS PACKAGEd BUT ALREADY BROKEN. DONT BUY!!!,"this guys sent me a sword packaged but already broken, it seems that is a bad thing to have this kind of providers anyway im angry that i spent more than $10.00 in garbage plus shiping etc.etc.thanks for nothing hope you enjoy my money."
1,THIS DOG DON'T HUNT!,"Want a phone that is off the hook without you're knowing it? Want to call customer support 6 times in one day until they finally tell you their system is down, please call back tomorrow? If so, this is the phone for you! I've owned it for 24 hours and that's long enough for me. What a waste of time and money."
1,Stink-o-rama,"Don't buy this phone. Yes, it has lots of really cool features - you can program it to recognize who is calling and play a pre-recorded (by you) message telling you who is calling - but after using it for about 6 months, the handset is barely working. Doesn't help much to have a cordless when you have to hit the speaker button on the base to answer your calls."
5,"Well, I don't know what all the fuss is about","'cause, I've had excellent service with this telephone. I purchased the unit over three years ago at Sears for $99. The voice is clear, the messages are clear, the range is good, callers hear me the instanst I answer the phone, and it has been very durable. I have a (now) 4 year old, so this phone has been dropped NUMEROUS times on hardwood floors, and has even fallen off the base a couple of times, which is 5 feet off the floor. (And yes, my wife and I have dropped it a few times, as well)With all that abuse, it is beginning to show problems after 3 years. Thinking seriously about keeping the answering system (base), retiring the handset, and buying a new cordless without an answering syetm.This unit has been discontinued. You see it is listed for half of retail.Maybe I was lucky, maybe I wasn't, but I must say this phone has been a very good one."
2,Answering system cuts off caller!,"I recieved a 9355 phone & answering system for Christmas. When the answering system took calls, MOST callers where cut off after 7-10 seconds when speaking at a normal speaking voice. I returned it for another unit and the same thing happened with the second 9355 phone system! If the caller talks very loud or virtually yells the message in the phone, then then it doesn't cut the caller off. We gave up on the 9355 and returned it for good!"
1,cheap hunk o'plastic,"This phone IS NOT user friendly. Complete pain to set up, and then if you DO need more assistance than what the jumbled instruction book gives you, they ask you to call an 800 number....an AUTOMATED help line.....a little robot woman tells you her best guess on how to fix your problem, then if that doesn't work, you're to call back on the same 800 number and press a certain number to shoot you straight to a live customer service rep......then a recording comes on saying ""sorry, our office ours are blah blah blah, please call back another time"".......ha ! We're taking it back and buying another brand of phone."
1,Junk!,I'm only giving this phone one star for its decent answering machine. This phone has the worst reception of any phone I have tried. I bought it to replace my aging AT&T which I've owned for eight years with no problem. I could not believe its cheap quality and poor reception. I am so disappointed to see the quality of AT&T phones go down the drain.
1,Watch out! I had bad experiences.,"I bought a 9350. I've gone through TWO warranty exchanges after problems, and even the third phone is now malfunctioning. The first two allowed callers to record messages -- and then every so often retained nothing. A couple friends asked why I never responded to their messages. Those are the ones who thought to ask -- who knows who else is out there thinking I didn't return their call. 3 phones, 3 sets of problems. 3 strikes. ATT is out."
1,This Phone stinks,this phone stinks because it has a messed up ringer. It takes 10 seconds for it to pick up you cant hear the person on the other line and if you go like another room away it knocks out so if i was a person looks for a new phone definetly do not buy this product because it sucks!
1,A real disappointment!,"I always purchase AT&T/Lucent phone products because they are durable and longlasting. But this particular phone had one problem after another. I agree with Portland entirely. Quite a disapointment! I ended up with a terrific Vtech model, less expensive, same features, more versatility and NO PROBLEMS!"
1,Great answerer horrible handset,"Love the answering machine, tho it's got so many functions it's not easy to use them all.Hate the phone - not rugged enough and audio is lousy. Using a headset helps but it doesn't hang in the cradle with the headset plugged in. Slow to answer when you hit the button, and sometimes I have to pull the battery to reset the handset to get it working again.I expected better from AT&T;."
4,pretty good cd.. worth the bucks,"quitened down since science and make yourself, but is definitely worth the bucks. not as good as science (classic) or make yourself.. nuff said"
2,"Not bad, just not my style","I got into Incubus with S.C.I.E.N.C.E. which is by far their best album, and though I was disappointed with the direction Make Yourself took, Morning View just made me not care at all about the band anymore. They went from a great hard rock/metal band into a soft rock/pop band and to put it bluntly it [is bad]. I'm not saying the CD is bad, just bad compared to everything else they've done. If you're into the slow boring poppy music then this CD is great, if you're expecting the Incubus of old, don't bother."
3,I just wish we could get a little of the old incubus back.,"I first became a fan of incubus back when S.C.I.E.N.C.E. came out. The song that made me think they were the greatest band was New Skin, then I got the album based on that and loved it. A Certain Shade of Green and Redefine were some of my favorite songs. So when Make Yourself came out I picked it up right away. I was somewhat dissapointed because there was only Privalege to satissfy the heavy side of me, but songs like Pardon Me and Drive were still really good and I was satisfied. Unfortunately, when I got morning view, there was still none of the incubus that got me hooked. I'm not asking for a hardcore metal album, just a couple songs along the lines of New Skin and A Certain Shade of Green. I appreciate the fact that they're trying to evolve their music, but just one or two songs can't be that hard to pull off."
3,"Good, but not that Good","Actually 3.5.When I first listened to the CD, I did not like it. I must admit that is growing on me, but I expected a little more. Don't get me wrong, the albulm is good, they just seemed to melllow out a bit."
4,The View ain't half-bad,"A more mature album than Make Yourself, Morning View manages to be introspective and insightful just enough to make you think these guys had some actual talent. At the same time, the album can kick some serious butt when it wants to, as in ""Blood on the Ground"" and ""Have you ever?""There's an Asian/Middle Eastern influence in some of the string arrangements. And what's up with the violins? The thing is, believe it or not, it works. It adds a sense of drama to the work, an innovation to metal(?) that's been sorely missing. I mean, it isn't as experimental as a Radiohead or a Bjork, but it's definitely something new to the genre. I've only had the album for two days, and it's all ready one of my favorites.There first single, ""Wish you were here,"" is a pretty good barometer of how the rest of the album plays out. If you liked that song, you'll probably like the rest of the CD."
1,Morning View- the worst album in rock history.,"Let's see, where do I begin? Apparently I can't look the other way without Incubus being all the rave now. I have a little secret to say to all this Brandon Boydites: GET A LIFE! Incubus is not orignal at all. The Cure has been doing music like this for 24 years. Incubus is nothing but a lame version of The Cure and Red Hot Chili Peppers (a band I absoultly hate), and no, they are not rock. This is music for 15 year old girls who got tired of listening to Backstreet Boys and wanted to listen to Incubus in order to seem smart. Well, no. If you want intelligent music, try The Cure's Disintegration, or some early Pink Floyd. Avoid this at all costs."
3,ok,"I find that this album is not as good as make yourself because it is a lot softer. I have both albums and i find make yourself is a lot better and heavier. Morning view is still pretty good because all of the heavier songs are good but all the other songs are soft and not that good. So, if you liked make yourself a lot you may not like this album this much, i was alittle disappointed, but it' s still good."
2,Faith No More for people who like to play hacky-sack.,"That pretty much sums it up. So does the fact that this sounds like if Sugar Ray went to Graduate School. To be kind, this is actually a lot better than most of what's out there. But that's not really saying much."
4,"Yea, it's good, but nothing special","This CD has some good moments, but Incubus seems to have finally gone more mainstream. Drive was a great song, and this CD has a bunch of good songs on it, but it is nowhere near the masterpieces of SCIENCE, Make Yourself, and A Crow Left of the Murder. I like a lot of these lyrics, but the whole sound is a lot more mainstream and less Incubus-like."
3,"5-star CD, but...","Well, I bought this album in October 2001, three days after it came out because it was a ""LIMITED EDITION CD, Includes exclusive video footage of the making of 'Morning View' in CD ROM multimedia!!"" (Direct quote from the sticker on the jewel case). So after a couple months I saw that my version of the CD was no longer in stores, so then I could say that I have CD with bonus features while you have the regular version. But now I'm angry because they released this with the bonus DVD, which I really wanna check out, but I'm not gonna shell out 15 bucks at a store, unless it's really cheap, for a CD I bought because of its Limited Edition-ness. The CD is great, but the record company is making me mad b/c I'll never see the DVD (none of my friends like incubus)."
5,Oh goodness!,"I get such a kick listening to Incubus...Morning View is great...I listen to it all the time in my car, in fact it's all I've been listening to ever since it came out. Yah it's that good! So get this CD if you are a fan, if youre not get it and I know that you will become one."
5,Dreamy,"I love this album. All the songs seem to just go together, flowing like the water. It's like they have a dreamy quality to them. Not that they're soft, but I feel like they have that sort of element to them. Favorites are Nice to Know You, Wish You Were Here, but the entire album is great."
4,Incubus' best album,"This is by far Incubus' best album. Each song shows alot of growth and maturity. People are calling them a ""sellout"" band because they changed their sound. Just to let those people know something anytime you sign on the dotted line you've sold out. Anyway back to the review I think they grew up from the Fungus and SCIENCE days. Which is a very good thing. I liked the older stuff but this new stuff has so much promise. Plus they're alot more focused on their writing. They're trying new things and making great songs. Anyway I think you should give this album a try."
4,incubus,"Incubus is new to me. I am exploring their sound and continue to find reasons to continue. This cd is intelligent, as well as inspiring. Very very talented band."
5,Floored and Impressed,"I had never heard of this band from Calabasas. I picked up the disc on a whim and was absolutely floored. Tracks like ""Aqueous Transmission"" and ""Echo"" are phenomenal on every level. It is rare to hear an album that is so well crafted, especially from such a young group of musicians. I look forward to the next release with anticipation. This is truly impressive."
3,"Good, but not science, or even make youself...A let down","As i counted down the days till the new Incubus cd release I was imagining how great it would be. I figuired it would be like science or make yourself, the two best cd's i've ever heard, but when i picked up their new cd I was bitterly disappointed. It took a long time to get over their change in style. Personally I hate that they have changed, they should have stuck with what got them this far. Hard rock was their thing, and now they turn a new leaf and go to soft rock...I dont care how hard rock cirlces is, none of the songs on morning view can come close to the awesomeness of songs such as vitamin, idiot box, a certain shade of green, pardon me, and the list goes on.. I really hope they return to the right path and stay clear of this soft rock [...junk] they are pushing now...AS a huge fan i think it is safe to say STICK WITH THE MUSIC THAT GOT U HERE...FOLLOW SCIENCE AND MAKE YOURSELF.."
4,Theyre sill making theirselves.,This album is a good follow up to their Make Yourself release. Its not as heavy but still has its kick. I dont know why everyone is saying that they sold out. Theyve been a band for almost 10 years they have matured down the line.
3,Just seems to be missing something,"After having been unexpectedly overwhelmed by the sharp lyrics, the intriguing melodies, and strong production of Incubus' ""Make Yourself"" album, I couldn't wait for ""Morning View"" to hit the stores. Unfortunately, this album doesn't quite reach the standards set in the band's previous release. The songs are still a little more literate than most bands out there today, it's just that there doesn't seem to be as much here to pull you in and grab you until the final track, ""Aqueous Transmission."" While die-hard Incubus fans will enjoy this, I don't think this album is as destined to be a classic as ""Make Yourself"" is."
1,not the best,"I had come to expect better from this band, but this wasn't so in this last album. This album was a great disappointment compared for the last album released."
1,Buncha liars,They ad is a lie and insead of a vinyl record they sent me a cd. not cool guys not cool
4,"better than the last, but could still use some improvement","Well...I JUST bought this cd and I can only say one word: awesome. I have liked incubus since they put out S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and own all of their albums. The reason that I like incubus is that they have all of the great stuff that limp bizkit and rage against the machine have, but they actually know how to write great songs that make good use of their talents. My favorite song on this album is blood on the ground. Other great ones are circles, nice to know you, and just a phase. I highly recommend this album to any rock or metal fan."
4,Dang good CD,"I believe that the reason I first started listening to Incubus is because I like to imitate their guitarist, but as I heard the CD more and more, I learned that the lyrics to are very poetic, something you don't hear much nowadays. Like in Under My Umbrella, I was utterly blown away by the power in those lyrics.And the other aspects of the music are very good, like the guitar, numerous trills and fast paced strumming, purely Incubus.It's classified as Rock but, I have to admit, sometimes their songs sound a little too much like Pop(e.g. Aqeous Transmission), but hey thats my opinion.The only thing that kept me from giving this CD a 5 is that they seemed to have kept to the rock genre more in this album than in Make Yourself and there just isn't that diversity of music that they had.If you like Rock, great guitar and powerfull lyrics, pick up this album right away, it won't dissapoint."
3,Well...,"You say what you want to say, but c'mon, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is eons better than this music Incubus is pumping out. You want mellow?, listen to Anti-gravity Love Song. You want hard?, listen to New Skin. You want funk?, listen to Calgone. It's ridiculous that Incubus has made such a paradigm shift and gone into this mellow territory. Sure, they're trying to please their ""fans"", but who are their real fans? Those of us who have been listening to them for a few years or those who think Make Yourself hasn't even been out for a year. I hope Incubus brings back a mixture of all of their styles in their next works, that's what I was hoping for here, I thought Incubus might try to recreate Certain Shade of Green or Favorite Things. It's too bad they didn't, I hope they try."
5,it doesn't matter,"""Incubus is selling out! oh no what will we do"". try shuting up!! Here is what you do: Listen to the CD, If you like it, great. if you don't, that is great too, it doesn't matter, just don't listen to the cd. don't tell people is not like them because nobody knows what incubus is all about, only they do. ""i am scared it will be beat to death by the radio"" IT DOESN""T MATTER. I don't care because i don't listen to the radio. I have all of incubus's cd's and think everyone of them is awesome. morning view is nothing like make yourself, it set apart in it's own way. It sounds to me more like a mellowed out s.c.i.e.n.c.e. with out the funk, which i do miss. If they wrote it when they was stoned, then this was written when they was coming down, but still great incubus."
4,Awesome,"This album deserves four and a half stars, so I put four. It is incredible, they have beautiful melodies, incredible guitar playing, brandon boyd has one of the best male voices out there. Not quite as good as Make Yourself, but so different that it is still really good. I love how each and every album they put out is different from the last, excellent and musically tight band."
4,A New Page for Incubus,"Over the last ten years Incubus has gone through a variety of sounds and styles, but Morning View's melodic patterns are the most different yet. Unlike their previous albums Incubus took the rap out of their metal and replaced it with angelic vocals and a hollow body sound. I am a fan of the bands earlier work and I have to admit this album did not appel to me at first. However, within a week I was singing along to songs like 11am and Just a Phase. This album is definitley a change of pace for Incubus and some might accuse them of selling out. Nevertheless, this is a well done album and I commend them for trying something new."
4,very good album...,"Incubus is likely one of the only important bands that will survive the rise and fall of the vastly overblown ""rap-metal"" genre (along with perhaps the other great band of this genre...the deftones). This is a great album which shows the bands range and maturity. The last song ""aqueous transmission"" (sic?) is an amazing rock song. Clearly the best Incubus album thus far..."
5,Incubus Puts out another good cd,"I have been a incubus fan for awhile now (just about 3 years). Make Yourself was the Incubus cd i got (and the best), but Morning View is a great followup. While Morning View is a little lighter than MY, it is still a great cd, and shows off the maturity of the band. Anyone who thinks Incubus is ""selling out"" should open up their eyes, because incubus has always been about doing different things with music. Incubus will always be a great band no matter what they do. Oh a just a personal note: the best song on this cd is Under My Umbrella"
5,Another great piece of work,"I was very pleased with this album from the very first time I listened to it. As usual, Incubus has offered well performed songs with meaningful lyrics. I agree with everyone else who says Aqueous Transmission is the best song on the album, even though I fell asleep during the one minute ensemble of crickets that trails at the end of the track. Morning View has not left my CD player since I put it in for the first time, and I'm sure it will hold it's place there for quite awhile."
4,They Just Keep Getting Better!!,"Morning View was released. I ran down to the local cd store and bought me a copy. At first i was dissapointed, felt a little let down and again very disappointed. I heard it as Make Yourself Mach 2.A couple of listens later i gave the lyrics a read along with the music. I found that the cd was definately a ""grower"", but it was also lyrically better than Make Yourself. Although, SCIENCE is my favorite Incubus album i feel as though musically Morning View is superior. The best example of this is Just A Phase which is a brilliant song.The lyrics follow the same type of message to oneanother, it seems as though someone has affected Mr Boyd emotionally at the writing of the album as through every song he refers to you. His lyrics really hit home and this album is his lyrical best as the emotion really hits home.This album reminds me of Silverchair's Neon Ballroom. Best tracks are Nice To Know You, Just A Phase, 11AM and Under My Umbrella."
3,Incubus is back but i miss the old them,"This is a good CD but the problem is that the CD is too soft and incubus is trying to repeat what they did with their last single drive. The harder songs on this Cd are excellent and so are some of the soft songs but alot of the soft songs are boring and repetitive. I have grown to miss the old incubus and their old sound from their past albums. This CD is good but it just doesn't seem like the incubus that the orginal fans (before everybody liked them because of ""drive"")learned to like and love. Hopefully the next album will be better."
5,How is this selling out?,"All these ridiculous nu-metal bands(Staind, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit etc.) suck. That is what the radio friendly sound has been for several years. Wake up! All of those bands are the one's that have sold out making uninspired noise with lame lyrical content capitalizing on teen angst. Now on to Incubus. To make a record like this would be the exact opposite of selling out. There are some great experimental tracks on this album with clever and insightful lyrics, which you don't hear on the radio much these days. On a final note I would like to say that you can't make the same album twice. Why make a record that sounded like Science all over again and never develop. That would be a waste of valuable creative energy and would get old after a while. Incubus is a great band and this is a great album."
3,Not as Good,"This c.d. is no where as good as S.C.I.E.C.E. or Make Yourself. They slowed down a lot. There are only about six good harder songs. All the rest are just too slow for what i'm used to by Incubus. You could say two words ""SELL OUT"". I hope they pick up the pace for there next c.d. instead of changing into a pop band. There not there yet, but they are close enough. On a better note songs 1 2 3 4 5 10 and 12 are pretty good. If you like the old Incubus don't buy this c.d. if you don't like the old Incubus then buy this c.d. and i'm 15 years old."
1,You knew it was coming,"Long time Incubus fans (as in before they were popular) no doubt knew that this would happen after the ""Drive"" single from the mediocre ""Make Yourself"" shot Incubus to never before thought of heights. And, what do you know? Incubus has gone from a unique sounding band (check out ""Fungus Amongus""), to one of the new wave of post grunge sensitive pop rock in the vain of Nickelback and Creed. ""Wish You Were Here""?, gimme a break, where have we heard that before? I think they were called Pink Fl...something or other. The ""heavy"" songs sound like the Backstreet Boys adding downtuned guitars, and it is a real shame because Incubus was once a great band, but as with the times, they've just gone with the trend. Skip this."
2,Pants,"Oh dear, once again instead of maturing the band have simply lost their edge and degenerated into a lame attempt at something new. This is no where near as refreshing as SCIENCE was and manages to land them perfectly on planet medocre. Poo."
2,this album [stinks],not that damn good of a album.only track they have that is good is they're first single off this album and that's it.i regret buying this cd.
1,Morning View (Morning Spew!),I am a hardcore Incubus Fan and I hate this CD. After hearing S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself you'll use this CD for a Beverage Coaster. The Lyrics and music of Morning View seem thrown together without much thought. I give This Album A -1 out of 5. They really let me down with this one. Otherwise one of my favorite bands.
1,Boo Hoo Hoo to the girl tired of this album getting picked o,"Well here's what I think of the album.... It's a sorry excuse for any of Incubus' work. And to the guy saying that Incubus changed mainstream. Heck no. I still talk to people everyday that have no idea who Incubus is. And when they do they usually just know one or two songs. Yes there is a few Incubus circles around, and thats probably how they'll stay. I could best compare it to the Insane Clown Posse. You have your fanatical listeners that live and breath it then everyone else will listen to it when they are forced to by those ""fanatics"".Thats it."
5,Absolutely brilliant,"After first hearing 'A Crow left of the Murder',I decided to listen to what my friend called ""a staple of everyone's music collection"".I was pleasantly surprised by this album,because the style is so subtly emotive on some on the beatiful melodies of 'Aqueous Transmission' and 'Echo'.This effortless lyricality contrasts well with the louder, more energetic tracks like 'Circles' and 'Nice to Know You'.The asian instrumental influence on some of the tracks only adds to the interest and infinite variation of this amazing collection of songs.Each one is individual perfection,except 'Are you in' which for some reason I hate."
3,Not as good as Make Yourself but nice album.,"I was kind of disapointed by Incubus' latest album Morning View. I guess they can never make an album as great as Make Yourself but this one was a good try. Wish You Were Here, Mexico, and Warning are my favorite songs. This album is one for only true Incubus fans."
5,The new psycedelic sound,"Sounds of erie beauty, bass, and insane sound effects makes up the newest incubus ablum Morning Veiw. This is there most unique album and by my view it's there best. If you like nice sounds and just laying back and sparkin a fatty this is a taker!Get the CD"
5,great cd!!!!!!,"first of all I heard about incubus in a hoobastank review, (im a hoobastank fan). people said hoobastank was a rip-off of incubus, and that they sounded alike. so I decided to get one of their cds hoping they might be as good as hoobastank. THEY ARE BETTER!!!. there is a bunch of awesome songs on this cd."
4,well I liked it...,k so its not like old incubus and thats ok. not as good as science or anything but i mean come on not much can compare right? if youre more into the really old incubus tho like fungus amongus incubus its not like that at all. its a lot more mellow. and ok some of the songs lyrics aren't that great. the music is good but sometimes the lyrics get kind of un-climatic like...goodbye nice to know you over and over. but when i'm in certain moods i really like this cd. i mean thats why i love incubus so much is cuz they always have SOMETHING from one of their albums to offer when youre in almost any mood. its great. but depending on your taste it might not be for you.
1,This CD has no flavor,This CD has no flavor. Every song is just one meaningless piece of trash after another. I really would like to know what happened to the band because they didn't sound like this before. This CD is just dull. I just don't like it that's all. I would recommend their earlier CDs though.
1,WEAK,"this cd is so freaken WEAK. I listened to it while I was on a road trip, and I nearly fell asleep at the wheel! They've definately lost their touch. I no longer enjoy incubus because of this cd. Their lyrics have gotten to be repetitive--almost as much as dance music has gotten these days! Thanks to incubus, they've turned me back towards better bands like Adema, Primer 55, Blink 182, and Green Day.I don't recommend this cd to anybody going on a long road trip-- not only will it make you fall asleep at the wheel, it'll make the trip seem LONGER than it actually is."
2,Not Worth the $$$$$,This album is not all that great.My favorite track on this albu mis the only track that they made a video for.This album isn't worth buying.I was very suprised about this album sucking so much.
2,Needs to go back to the Incubator.,"This needs more heat and maybe then something good could hatch. This is a disappointment after their last album because none of the songs are memorable in the least. This is generic, commercialized garbage."
4,"Good, but not better.","Morning View is definitely an excellent recording, but to me, it's not quite as good as their earlier stuff. Incubus has kept their weird, original sound, but used in an overall softer context. It kind of sounds like it at first, but no, they did not sell out, which I worried they might do after Drive became a hit on pop radio. A few listens and it's clear that their sound is totally different from anything else out, including their past efforts. If you liked Make Yourself, you should like this one. All in all, Morning View is just the next evolution of Incubus from Fungus Amongus to SCIENCE to Make Yourself and onward. The differeces between Make Yourself and Morning View are pretty much the same differences as between SCIENCE and Make Yourself. You'll understand when you hear it."
4,Heavy in doses,"Firmly there are six songs you will play over and over again. That's six, not the full album. But what does that mean? Girating pleasure for the full mix. Though I haven't heard the acclaim I hoped it would get, take it from a pleasure seeker that Morning View does its duty, and will show a face to modern rock that has lacked; heavy-headed structure. My personal pick is track 8, Warning. These guys are something that few others are; smart. They're not System of a Down or GnR (also Los Angeles), but maybe an advanced eightees band that never found their sound. If you want your ass kicked in modern music, and you have a system loud enough to entertain them, go for it."
4,Letting the sunshine in,"Filled with high energy and with descriptive lyrics, Incubus' third album ""Morning View"" comes out to be a joyful and uplifting scene. With acoustic tones and with a slow style of Nirvana, you get ""Mexico"". In ""Aqueous Transmission"" has very nice twangy guitar tone that'll give you a nice exotic feeling towards the album. ""11 am"" a detailed with a depressive mood but beautifully played. An unexpective song would have to be ""Are You In"" a nice song that gives the album and nice jazzy twist. Besides the slow acoustics tones and depressive lyrics, the album also comes with the normal accressive thrashers like ""Circles"", ""Nice to Know You"", ""Blood on the Ground"", and ""Have you Ever"". Without rap or screaming vocals found in most bands, it's nice to find a band that experiments and tries new styles without using the rage or aggression that much. Great album for all Incubus fans and traditional music lovers."
5,Greatest Damn Album This Year,"If you haven't heard the new Incubus cd (Morning View), then you are just not cool. It is one of the greatest albums of the year and deserves recognition as so. I bought the cd for the songs ""Nice to Know You"" and ""Circles"", but I now know that it is much more than that. It has the hard rock songs that brought us to the band in the first place, but delivers a punch with the soft songs of ""Mexico"" and "" Aqueous Transmission"" that bring us even more to being a Incubus fanatic. Then they really give you cold shivers down your spine when you turn on the TV and see one of their videos. It makes for one great experiences. The only thing that is better than buying the CD, is buying the DVD AND the CD. It has it all. If you buy one CD this year, buy Morning View, you won't be disapointed. There are some songs that you can listen to only on the radio, Morning View possesses none of these! It is the Greatest Damn Album This Year!!"
2,not much excitement or originality,"If you want this cd, i owuldnt argrue with your opinion or anything, but if you're reading this, i would recommend with a passion tht you dont take the time or money needed to buy this. I mean really. In my opinion, theyve odne anything but matured since the early days. I'm a S.C.I.E.N.C.E. fan basically, and after that i could perosnally live without this band or thier brothers audiovent. Warning and Nice to know you were the ony songs on the album i ever really liked. Break away from the mainstream and listen to filter or something"
2,Nothing Special,"Honestly, this album is nothing special. There are no real great songs on this album. Still I do respect that Incubus has continued writting ""different"" sounding songs. If you want good Incubus music, get S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Make Yourself or Fungus Amoungus. This album is probably thier worst."
2,way to acoustic and weak,"this album is totally different to the others where as the others where more heavy and more fun to listen to where as this album makes you go to sleep. The only song i liked from the album was nice to know you and the rest where just way to weak and the lyrics are ... boring and if you are thinking of getting the album i recomend that you look for another album for example albums by system of a down they have never let me down in years and they have much more interesting lyrics which are about very interesting social issues and they are much more talented than incubus and there album toxicity has sold much more copies than this album, so yes i am really disapointed with this album and it was that bad that i returned it and got my money back and i learnt a lesson always listen to an album before you purchase it."
3,A Step Down...,"A notch below ""Make Yourself"" and the brilliant ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E.""Popularity and corporate radio kills another great band..."
1,A load of tripe!,"The only good song on this CD is Circles. Every other song blows. If you want some good Incubus, listen to their earlier CDs"
1,A bad example of maturity,When did Incubus turn into Creed? What a [terrible] album. It's so bad that I can't even listen to their old albums anymore.
1,Sell Outs!,"After seeing them live about a month before this cd came out I was pumped up and ready to hear it. Expecting S.C.I.E.N.C.E 2 I got ""Brandon sings the blues"" instead, it makes me sick that the band iv'e followed for over 5 years have sold out to a bunch of teenage girls who will have forgotten them when the backstreet boys bring out their next single. Hope this CD made you rich fellas because the fans of your early cd's will be more wary when they buy your next one!"
3,rocker?,"I'm not a real old fan of Incubus, I do like S.C.I.E.N.C.E but I think new Incubus is not that bad. Drive and Wish you were here are freakin pop songs. Brandon cut his hair and they become a boy band. Thet're still ok for me. But their music video ""Are You In?"" is really make me sick. Weak is ok, but yuppie is not ok.Don't wear damn suit you Brandon boy!!"
2,Why so great?,"You cant deny the true pure talent shown by Incubus, but lately, the focus on the band seems to be more at Brandon's body, than the music. The last reviw i read was from some chick talking about how she liked that he took off his shirt. This completely pisses me off. This is a great band, and the music can just melt into you, and become a part of you, and these brain-dead little twelve year olds only see him, i bet you they dont even own S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Which is by far the best album. All i gotta say is if your gonna be a fan at least be a fan for the right reasons."
1,SELLOUTS....learn how to write lyrics...again,"This cd does not even compare to any of the first three Incubus albums. It all started going down hill with ""Make Yourself"". An apt title to preceed this album since ""Morning View"" is exactly like every other main stream rock album out there. Brandon used to have so much lyrical talent. Now all he does is sing ""I wish you were here"" over and over in the choruses. Or ""good bye nice to know you"". I guess it has a lot to do with doing too much drugs. But if I were you I would purchase an older Incubus cd, where the music is structured and the lyrics were actually thought out before they were recorded. If I could have given this cd half a star I would have. [...]"
5,new CD rocks,I think the above summary from Amazon sums up very well what this band is all about. I think they put together a GREAT album and I will play it a lot and never get tired of it. The slowness of some of the songs is what makes the CD great. They are Good enough as a band to be able to stray away from all their songs sounding like the Radio hit. I love all the songs...it just depends on the mood i'm as to which songs i want to hear at that moment. ENJOY the CD...you won't be disappointed.
4,BUY THIS CD!!,"The new Incubus CD ""Morning View"" is a great album. If you're a fan of ""Make Yourself"" you'll definitely love this one too. Even fans of S.C.I.E.N.C.E and earlier Incubus will probably like ""Morning View"" too. This album doesn't have a lot of their earlier funk sound, but it's still great nonetheless. I bought this CD yesterday when it came out and I've already listened to it a couple times through, it keeps getting better. All the songs are good, but I really reccommend 11am, Are You In, Wish You Were Here, & Warning.Definitely check out this CD - you won't be disappointed!"
4,New Sounds From Incubus,"I felt that Morning View is the kind of album that grows on you the more you listen to it. When I first listened MV I didn't know quite what to make of it. It sounds much different than their previous albums. I listened to it a couple times, reading the lyrics as I went. The songs are very deep in an emotional way. The new rhythms and melodies are excellent and I like it more everytime I listen to it. If you like Incubus you'll like this CD."
2,Big Disappointment,"what happened??? Fungus Amongus, SCIENCE, make yourself all of which are incredible CDs. They are hard, they are innovative and they all have something to say. Morning View is just easy listening crap. With the success of Drive, and all of the fans that just hopped on the incubus fanbase because they heard that song without even hearing their older work, i beleive incubus has changed. Morning View is an example of that. If you listen to SCIENCE and than hear this CD, you would think its a different band. I just hope the next CD they plan to do goes back to the sound that their earlier CD's were representing. All in all if you are an early incubus fan... dont waste your money, but if you hopped on the bandwagon this will be your number 1 CD."
4,"Great CD content, average DVD","Hello:It is not a mistery that Incubus' Morning View is an exellent piece of work, such as Make Yourself or S.C.I.E.N.C.E, still innovative and creative. Their music has evolved to better rythms and lyrics, and they still have a great variety of styles to play, not just common rock. Take, for example, the difference in style between Just a Phase and Have you Ever.The DVD is very limited. It includes the video of Are You In and a backstage that finishes with a live presentation of ""Warning"". It also includes the discography of DVD's."
5,Incubus is rock,This is my favorite Incubus CD. The mellow sounds of the band and the trippy riffs are the heat.
4,Excellent,"An excellent CD. A friend recommended Incubus to me and within a week of downloading Incubus mp3s from the net, I decided to buy the album. It's a great album. The only down side is that it *isn't* one of those albums which you can just carry on listening to. If you want one of those types of album, I suggest you take a look into Counting Crows or the Smashing Pumpkins. Anyway, I highly recommend this album. Buy it!"
5,Super...rocking yet mellow chillout,"This disc is one killer piece of plastic and foil. It just rocks so nice. It's got some action pact tracks, but also a few mellow chillout songs. That's the only word you can use for the quiet songs, ""Chillout."" I had some friends over and it was like 2 a.m. and we just listened to this and it was...great. And with Aqueous Transition at the end there, it nearly knocked me out with its super soporific qualities. (for those not in my english class, soporific means puts you to sleep).This album is very uplifting, no depressing, soulless garbage that most bands are shoving down the throats of the unwashed masses ....Oh, yeah,...Get it. right now."
3,Worst Incubus CD yet,"Incubus is one of my favorite bands and I was pretty dissapointed with this CD. The majority of the 13 songs on this CD were main stream or soft. There were a couple good old Incubus songs like #1,2,3,11 and 12. The rest are pretty boring. Overall, it wasn't too bad, but too mainstream and different from the other Incubus CDs."
4,Good.,"Morning View is a good CD. But when I purchased an Incubus CD, I wasn't expecting something that sounds like Dave Mathews. Anyway, I really like this CD. But it doesn't compare to SCIENCE or Make Yourself, which I do give 5 stars to. If you're an Incubus fan, you will probably be dissapointed. I got to like this CD, so I'm not dissapointed, but its not as good."
2,Eh.,"This CD is decent. Really, after the first three tracks it takes a dive. The lyrics are pretty weak, the music is all right. Nice to Know You and Circles are their best efforts on this. I know it was overplayed but I Wish You Were Here isn't that bad, it's all right. The rest of the album isn't bad, it's just boring and bland. Their previous works (even Make Yourself, because the music was still active and interesting and the lyrics were still great) were fabulous showcases of their talent and ability. Morning View is just a bland attempt at trying to have melody. Maybe a 12 year old thinks this music is profound, amazing, and/or hard, but not anyone who knows what those words mean and what this band is about. As people have stated before, buy all their albums, then buy this. It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good."
5,really good cd!!!!!!,"this cd is so awesome. at first it wasnt one of my favorite cds, because it was so different from their other albums, but the more i listened to it, the more i liked it. my favorite songs on the album are mexico, echo, are you in and aqueous transmission. i HIGHLY recommend this cd to anyone who likes incubus or who just wants to listen to good music. it is still in my cd player and i bought it a day after it was released. it is one of my all-time favorite cds."
3,pretty average,"i am not a huge incubus fan although i think fungus amongus and science are both brilliant albums! i have tried listening to this album a few times and just haven't been able to get into it at all really! i mean theres a few good songs, but compared to the other albums i mentioned it's crap! if you are a big incubus fan you are obviously gonna buy this, if you are just catching up with incubus, which im sure is happening now they have become a lot more mainstream recently especially with the wussy 'wish you were here' then buy their early albums first! still worth a listen though!"
5,Best Incubus Cd to Date,"Awesome cd. I bought it for the radio hits, and soon found that I LOVED all of them. The best incubus cd out there, can't wait to get my hands of A Crow. All the songs are great. BUY NOW!!!!"
5,The Telephone Rings True,"This is a fascinating documentary, one that is both entertaining and culturally enlighting at the same time. The tape follows Bells initial introduction of the Telephone in 1876 to the first coast-to-coast phone call. The interviews are engrossing -- including descendants of both Bell and Watson -- and the modern photography quite beautiful. Highly recommended."
4,Take Two,"This album is one of my favorite ones for relaxing. I love the danceable fiddle tunes, and the songs all tell a story. My favorite track is Silver Spear because it makes me want to dance. Also the song, ""Hardly a Sound"" is beautiful and very sad. I heard these guys with their band, The McCabes, when they were in Portland. Their live show is very high-energy, while this CD is more acoustic. I wish they had put even more fiddle tunes on it!"
3,"Some Relevance, but Outdated","I cannot really recommend this DVD. Most of what is in the DVD is relevant, but there are so many better places to go for the information. In 1996, this would have been an amazing video, but too much has happened since then. This DVD is in big need of an update. The Biblical message is accurate, and that's the best part, but any Missler, Stone or other DVD on Biblical prophecy that is not as old is a much better investment.Lastly, I was stunned to see Al Gore and Encarta used as references. Haven't both of these sources been debunked? Even in the 1990's, most of us knew these were not reliable sources of information. Today, most know them to be unreliable."
2,Another promo for Al Gore,"As soon as they started quoting Al Gore as their main reference regarding man-made ""Global Warming"" (now called climate change because of the negative connotation attached to the previous term due to bad and corrupted data that had to be shredded), I had to stop taking it seriously because anything attached to Al Gore cannot be trusted. They also totally misrepresent Revelations, just as every other new age attempt to interpret scripture without knowing the culture at the time, knowing what they knew (the ancient Jewish scriptures), and knowing how to actually read the Bible for all its worth."
3,Good Info But not recent,i guess i was expecting more than old facts. I was looking for more actual facts but it is my fault because the DVD was made a while ago.
5,One Of The Best,"This is maybe one of the best movies made. If you liked A Better Tomorrow, you'll like this."
1,Leaks Leaks Leaks,"I purchased this iron 8 months ago, and treated well with regular cleaning, and when I pour water in for steam, it pours right out of the side of the iron. and it not pleasant to iron your cloths with water pouring out all over your clothes, so I have to use it without steam...so what's the point? I thought it would be a really nice iron."
1,Horrible Iron X820,"When I bought this iron, I was happy for 2 months, then it started to leak water, now every time I hit the steam button I don't get steam all I get is a water leak... I agree, if I could return this, I would, problem is they no longer have this model and won't substitute another. I will stick with Rowenta...."
1,THIS IRON SUCKS,"I just bought this iron today thinking that it was good, since it held a hefty price tag of $40. As soon as i used it, water started leaking out everywhere. This iron is going right back in the box to be returned."
1,Does not work at all.,"This product is worthless, does not record the number to call when the alarm triggers, just redial the last number you dial so you cant use it as a regular phone if you dont remember allways that, and worst of all... it does not work at all, as soon as you put the alarm on, the phone start dialing the number no matter what, sad thing for what could be a very good product."
2,"Contemporary History, Sort Of","This book tries to give a bit of everything, but ends up doing nothing very well. First, the book is not very large, which is not a good sign when you are trying to cover two thousand years worth of history. The biggest section in the book discusses what is going on in the modern Orthodox world in the various Orthodox jurisdictions. Unfortunately, even this information is not very helpful as it was not especially accurate. The author's claims, for example, about the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia are exaggerated; the author essentially take the statements of a few firebrands within ROCOR and projects them onto the entire jurisdiction as though the statements are ROCOR's official position or dominant belief. Readers would be better served reading The Orthodox Church by Bp. Kallistos, or even Fr. Alexander Schmemann's The Historical Road of Eastern Orthodoxy."
4,late to the party,i just picked up a used copy of this cd. i am in my 50`s -i barely recall the flick. i think it was ok...........i have been playing it in my car continuosly.someone else mentioned throwing out the VIC DAMON track. no way!!! a hilarious bit of comic relief in a lineup of sold tracks to be certain.................
4,"Great songs, but this collection has many country-style songs","This CD is tolerable. We own Volume 1 and love it. I bought this one specifically for one of the songs it contains.My son loves it, but a note to parents - this CD has a country music feel to it."
5,Great fun!,"My daughter (11) and nephews (8, 1) all love this CD. The older kids have fun singing & dancing with the baby, and the baby loves to listen to the CD by himself as well."
2,"Boring and lifeless music, and no Disney characters.","First of all, don't let the ""Disney"" in the title mislead you. None of these songs are sung by Disney's animated characters except for a few brief seconds of Mickey Mouse speaking during the first song. This was a big disappointment for us.All songs are performed by a rather bland sounding singer accompanied by a bland bluegrass/folk band and an even more bland group of young backup singers. Are you catching my theme here? Childrens' music is supposed to be fun and playful, but the performances here are too polished and completely lacking in real gusto. There's just very little here to really engage the young listener's attention, and adults will find it pretty dull as well. There are plenty of better choices in the category of childrens' music."
1,Nothing New Here,It's not a bad book. Well written and easy to read. But it's all been said before in other books and other places. You'd be better off spending yor money elsewhere.
2,Stating the Obvious,"As a job coach, I read many of these business self-help books. It seems we're in this period of endless repackaging of the same material. The information in this book can be found in many others...no doubt one that the average businessperson would already have in their library. Might make a useful graduation gift for someone you know."
1,Less then 1 star,This book was a waste of time & money with nothing new or even interesting. It contains information that JHS student would know
3,Huge! But has flaws,"I got this for my mother who has not a sharp knife in the house from years of glass cutting boards. This keeps the blades sharp but shows scarring and more importantly has physical scarring (you can feel it). It doesn't seal as well as some other boards.It cleans well enough so I'm not worried about cross contamination but it's not as nice as an end grain model. But for the cost and for the size it's great.I think it could use a sanding after every few months and that would restore it but I think a board should hold out longer then a ""few months"" (4 or 5) between sandings.It's perfectly flat and after numerous cycles in the dishwasher has proven it's dishwasher safe. Though not dishwasher friendly as it's huge."
5,Great book!,"I loved this book, explains the muscular system in full detail. I wish all specialized educational books were as easy to read."
4,Excellent lightweight field-guide,"An amazing amount of useful information packed into a booklet not much bigger than the average camera manual.This is one book that is to be found permanently stashed in my camera bag while out in the African bushveld.Particularly noteworthy are the chapters dealing with lenses, exposure, film types and composition. When in the field, I find myself often referring to the chapter on exposure, which is one of the clearest most concise expositions I have ever seen on the subject."
3,Suited for experienced film photographers only.,"I'm looking forward to the other Arthur Morris books (ie. I've got his Shorebirds book which I think is AWESOME). This book, however offers very little value if you are a digital photographer. It's poorly printed, has little useful information for a budding bird photographer, and isn't (to my simple ways) very useful. That said, I think there are other things out there by Mr. Morris that are useful. Compare this book to Bird Photography by Steve Young - that's a book that inspires, coaches, and educates - which I believe Mr. Morris does a great job of in his own classes.In short, avoid this book unless you're a film buff, but do buy other Arthur Morris books."
4,Very useful,This book is particularly useful for the exposure information - especially important in photographing birds.
3,Kind of makes me wish I'd paid more attention to Seventeen,"Subtitled Life's Most Embarrassing Moments and How to Deal, this is recognizable to all Seventeen Magazine as a regular feature in the magazine. Culled from the letters to the ""Most Embarrassing Moments"" column, from teen interviews, and the author's own horrific (are there any other sort?) teen memories, Trauma-rama promises to both titillate and inform. The stories culled feed the necessary schadenfreude of teen embarrassment (""My misadventure was bad, but hers--!!!"") but also describe how to deal with or dodge ""traumas"". Despite my gut feeling that ""trauma"" is a flailed chest or parent dying, I do recognize the appeal of common sense social advice wrapped up in teen-friendly packages (""How to talk to guys in 4 easy steps"") and organized around the sort of mishaps that make ordinary teens sick to their stomach, such as ""Love Bites"", ""Friendship Fallout"", and ""Bodily Dysfunctions""."
4,The Real Deal,"As not only a high school student, but also as a former clutz, this book made a big impact. Dealing with embarrassment and humiliation is a difficaul task for teens. Wearing the same dress as the most popular girl in school can ruin a girls' self-esteem. In this book there are detailed ideas in which teens can face up to there problems. Being that I am a former clutz, I know how it feels to be humiliated. But within the bindings of this book you can find ways of dealing with those humiliations. I completely recommend this book."
5,Texas Specials Rock!,"I have wanted to put a set of these pick-ups in my Strat for a long time now, I'm talking about, well, over ten years (I have a 1983 Fender Standard U.S.A. Strat). They are not as over-wound, in appearance, as I expected them to be; say for example as a Seymour Duncan SSL-5. I do things a little differently in my guitar. I use the bridge pick-up in the neck position, the middle as usual, and I have a Seymour Duncan SH-2 Jazz Pick-up in the bridge position. This is a dream combination. My guitar is clean, but with edge and articulation."
4,Let's shoot straight!,I've had these pickups in my american strat for 2 years and I love these pickups but heres the deal. They have noise issues. Because they are such an aggressive pickup for aggressive players like stevie ray they create a buzz no matter what you do. I've read many reviews and other ppl experiencing the same thing. And its not a ground issue its just the way the pick ups are made. So if your playing blues or rock or doing something with alot of soloing then these bad boys are great! And I love the blues but I primarily play in church so for my setting they are little to aggressive even when im clean and little too noisy for the FOH when they are mic'ed up. So be aware of this but if they fit your style and genre then rock on!Thanks!
5,Fits Like A Glove & Feels Good,"5 Stars all around great deal. Fits my S&W; Model 66-6 like a glove. Had no difficulty installing and am looking forward to enjoying a smaller, low-profile grip for occasional use.If you have a 4"" barrel or longer, I would not suggest getting these grips or the gun will feel too front heavy."
4,"Great book, good reflection","It arrives quickly,and it's in good condition as described. It is as good as it's completely new even though the previous owner kept it for 30 years."
3,shabby,"it said the book was used, but this book was very old and very used! i will have a hard time now deciding to save a few dollars by purchasing used products from amazon."
4,"Good deal, slow delivery","These are nice and inexpensive and fill the bill for a student kit, but if you need them, order them WELL in advance, because they are not always in stock and delivery is slow."
2,Bent fork,"Though I did get this product quickly, the fork was bent when I went to use it in class for the first time and did not make noise because of it. I had to go buy another tuning fork before my practical later that week."
1,"Painfully boring, luckily, it is short","Reading this book is like reading dry after action reports. All I got out of it was how much ammo they expended on a daily basis. The print is huge so it is good for those who are half blind. It is only about 60 pages so I read it in about 3 hours. It's like they took a chapter from a book like ""Panzer Aces"" and made another book out of it. Don't waste your money."
5,Great Quality,"I bought three of these shelves for my daughters room and I'm very happy with them. I didn't want to spend lots of money on shelves but I was hoping to avoid the particle board type of tacky looking shelves and these shelves were perfect. They are high quality, strong and stylish."
4,The bookcase is sturdy an meets my needs,"The bookcase was easily assembled. It is not bulky. All of the space occupied by the bookcase is essentially available for book storage. I resisted saying ""I love it."" Even though it is highly functional at the five star level and well worth the cost, it is not a showpiece."
5,Funky Bookcase,"I needed 2 bookcases. I was cautious. I figured I'd order one and see how I liked it, then decide whether to order another. It arrived early. It had the exact dimensions the listed in the product specification section. It had all the pieces. None of them were damaged. It had instructions. It was EASY to put together (from in the box to filled with stuff inside an hour). It's holding everything that used to be on two smaller (and much heavier) wood shelves. It's pretty spiffy looking too. I guess it's time to order that second bookcase now. :)"
4,Nice Bookcase,My daughter has a bunkbed in the same type of black metal as the bookcase. she loves the bookcase. Was fairly easy to put together. At the bottom it looks a bit twisted and can't straighten but other than that fine.
4,"Good range, limited features","The phone has good range and clear sound. However, accessing some of the features like turning off the ringer and switching from tone to pulse operation is difficult. Also, although you can change the volume of the earpiece for calls, the ringer volume cannot be changed and is a bit on the louder side (you can change the type of ring it makes, though). It's decently priced and has good range, and that's what really counts."
2,AT&T quality is getting worse,"I just bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and so far I have not been too impressed. Twice now I have put the handset in the cradle for a recharge, the recharge light will come on and ten to twelve hours later I will find that it has not charged. There is an infernal hum that I cannot get rid of and people complain that I sound hollow or distant. The small size makes it uncomfortable to cradle so I got an AT&T headset to use with it and that was even worse. If you buy this save the original packaging so you can return it."
1,DOA,"I've always owned AT&T cordless phones due to the high quality of the phones. I decided on this phone with the same thoughts of AT&T quality on my mind. Boy was I disapointed. The phone was DOA out of the box. I charged it up for the required 12 hours but when I went to make a call there was no dialtone. I plugged in another phone to make sure that the line was ok and it was, plugged the new phone back in and nothing. I tried serveral steps per the manual but with no luck. I returned the phone and bought another make/model."
4,Good Phone,This phone is a great value. The clarity is superb and I have not run into any range problems. My only complaint is the dialing pad. The number buttons are on the small side and the display does not light up. But don't let those minor problems deter you from purchasing this phone -- IT IS A BARGIN.
2,"Tinny, hisses.","I was very disappointed with this phone. The sound is tinny and always has a lot of hissing. When I first speak there is a startling echo.So far as the range goes, I live on a 4000 square foot lot, and there is noticable drop-off (the sound becomes choppy and incoherent) at the edges of my small property. I would have expected much greater range from DSS.I returned the phone."
1,"Simply an awful, awful product","After a two months, the phone started dropping calls. Then the battery charger stopped working. After complaining to AT&T, they sent me a new one under the warranty. Guess what? It drops calls too. You're continually having to remove the battery from the handset and/or unplugging the base unit to ""reset"" the phone. I'm currently shopping for a new phone to replace this piece of garbage."
1,Low quality control,"We bought this phone after a previous Lucent 900MHz digital phone died after about 2 years of good service. After about a month with this phone, it has lost charge on both batteries, there is signal interference (that we never experience with the previous digital phone), and the range is flaky. This is a bad phone. I'm really disappointed with AT&T and Lucent. I now understand why their stock prices have taken such a beating."
1,Bad phone,"I bought it because I like the 900 analog phone of AT&T. I like it size & shape and light weight. I expected that 900 digital will be better, well, I was wrong. I has been working for almost a month then it'd just gone blank, no signal of any kind. The telephone set is very warm while charging makes holding it quite uncomfortable. The dial buttons are very hard to press & insensitive, I have to used extra efforts to press them frequently. Clearity is no better than the 900 analog, I recived lots of compaints from the person whom I called, espeacially when I used it in front of a computer, I had to change to speak on a normal phone. Keep your money to buy something else, it's just a waste of $50."
2,do not buy this phone,The major feature that I wanted was volume. It gave me that and that is about it. There is a static that will not go away when the phone is in use. The manuel tells you to do several things if there is static and if none work then you are out of luck. None worked for me. I will never buy an ATT phone again.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this phone when Amazon. com was running a rebate special--the phone's final price was ($$$). Well, the phone is worth about ($$$)! It does have some nice features such as digital spread and speed dial. Plus, the design is rather compact. However, the sound is not too clear and calls get dropped. Furthermore, this phone constantly caused my phone line to stop working (granted, I also had a computer and answering machine hooked up). After a few months, I decided to buy a Michael Graves phone from Target (also available through Amazon)--that phone works perfectly and my phone line is in tact!"
1,2 purchased 2 bad,"I purchased 2 AT&T 900 Mhz DSS phones and was disappointed that after 2 months, both handsets were not communicating with the base unit.The handsets establish an open connection and tie the line up, but I can't get a dial tone. Its nice to hear the phone ring, pick it up, and get nothing. I would stay clear of this one."
1,BAD PHONE,"This phone was bad from the start. It had an ecoh sound and the range was only 50 feet before it started to have really bad audio. It refused to connect with the base often (BEEP BEEP). The power plug would spark when plugged in to the base. Then it would refuse to charge. I charged the battery manually for a while but now it won't come on at all, it just gives it's familiar ""beep beep"" error sound. I spent [alot of money] on this thing new and I'm [mad]."
1,Keep Away from AT&T 900Mhz phones,"I purchased this phone from a national electronics store thinking that AT&T would make a good phone. Wrong! After a couple of months, the line buzzes when used, it occasionally doesn't pick a channel when used, and after a while it stopped disconnecting/charging when the phone was placed on the base. I replaced it with a 4 year old Panasonic 900Mhz (and bought a new Panasonic as well). I have owned 900Mhz phones made by AT&T, Panasonic and VTech and Panasonic phones seem to have the best range, sound and features for the money (especially in New York City where there is a lot of interference)."
5,The Best of Sarah Vaughan: 20th Century Masters,"Legendary, beautiful, smooth and so lovely. If you love Ella you will love Sarah. I highly recommend a listen to this cd."
5,Soft,"I love this old school music, everyone should own this cd..I always buy the old school music and will keep looking for these types of CDs."
2,They Oz Man Gone'eth,"Do you like the traditional Ozzy sound? Well, you sure won't find it here. To be honest, some of the songs do sound pretty good, but it's just not Ozzy! It sounds like Ozzy has come ""down to earth"" too much; he needs to go back up and start ""flying high again."""
3,To all the naysayers...,"I don't know why everybody's slamming this album so hard.I think ""Dreamer"" is one of the best songs Elton John has ever done."
4,"Great, but Ozzy has done better","I just recently bought this album, and I really like it a lot, but compared to Blizzard of Ozz, Diary of a Madman, and No More Tears, this one isn't quite as good. But, then again, heavy metal had a different style at that time. The band has a really strong sound, especially with Zakk Wylde's guitar. My favorite songs are: Gets Me Through, Facing Hell, Dreamer, That I Never Had and Black Illusion. A great addition to a heavy metal collection or if you just like Ozzy."
4,respect for ozzy,"although I have never been a fan of Ozzy Osbourne,due to the fact that his ""reputation"" seems to get more play than his music,and he can be excessive with his showmanship...after hearing some cuts from this CD,I have to admit the man does have talent....especially liked ""Dreamer"" which also shows that Ozzy does have some feeling,not just a ""madman""...."
