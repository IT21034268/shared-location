3,The school is still out,The belts have not been used yet but I'm glad to have been able to purchase them.
4,Good deal on belts..,"Who doesn't hate breaking a belt and driving all the way to sears or wherever just for a lousy belt? Stock up on these, tuck em in the closet, and fugeddabout it. you will be glad you did."
4,Great company,"I ordered these belts from Killdirt and initially was discouraged to see that amazon charged like $5 for shipping and the shipping actually cost 65 on these belts. I left a bad review (2 Star) and was contacted the very next day by the company asking what they could do to make me satisfied with my order. I was very pleased with the woman I spoke with who really seemed like she wanted to help. Just talking with her was enough to make me realize they are a caring company.The belts, I have not actually used yet because the vacuum is still brand new but They look perfect."
5,Exactly What I Needed,These belts were an EXCELLENT deal and they work great! I got two of them for only $3.50 and FREE SHIPPING. VERY PLEASED! Thank you! :)
3,Didn't fit,"I ordered the replacement belt using the vacuum's model number. I do not recall which site I got the information for the belt from other than it was replacement parts for Hoover Vacuum parts. The belt didn't fit, it was way too small. Being it didn't cost much I didn't try to return it (my bad). I don't imagine they would have given me a hard time but I needed to get the belt ASAP so I found something that fit close and used that.The part was quality, just the wrong size.""If the belt don't fit, you must acquit!"""
5,Good Deal,"These belts came quickly in the mail, they fit properly and the price was right, I would do repeat business here."
4,Latin Fun,"I'm not one to jump on the ""Pretty boy of the hour"" bandwagon, but after his performance on the AMA show, I was intrigued. This CD is a good blend of Bonbon shaking fun and oozing romantic ballads. It's easy to listen to and a great way to put a little latin spice in your life!"
3,Uninspired and under-achieving,"This is a disappointing album to say the least. Aside from ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" and songs from his previous albums, the rest are generic and formulated.After looking at the credits on the album I came to realize why. The writers that made ""Vuelve"" such a huge success had minimal contributions on this one. Robi Rosa & KC Porter are the brain child for Ricky's success, NOT these new writers (Emilio Estefan and Desmond Child).Ricky, Ricky. You've got great potential, but don't forget your roots. Don't sell out.Boricau baby......."
4,"Good album that says ""I can do more if you ask me to.""","Verdict: Great, but not quite Awesome. Commercially sensible. Very competent to excellent musically. Surprisingly subtle in places. A couple of lyric sets let down the side, but, hey, he's not trying to be Mark Knoffler. Needs to be a little more careful of the point between class and crudity / sexy and just sex. A good album that shows RM is capable of more if only someone would ask him to give it."
3,Ricky Martin,"Ricky Martin's 'Vuelve' is a better album than his self-titled Spanglish album. Albeit, I enjoyed most of the songs on the new album, I've come to an inevitable realization that there really is nothing spectacular about the album. Sure ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" is fun; but is that all this album has going for it? Well, not exacly. I thought ""Spanish Eyes"" was alluring and grand; and the Madonna/Ricky duet commendable. However, ""Shake Your Bon-Bon"" is laughable and the Spanglish version of ""The Cup of Life"" seems muddled. ...And is there a reason that the fairly boring ""She's All I Ever Had"" had to be sung in Spanish at the near end? All in all, the album isn't breakthrough or totally original, but it has its moments."
2,disappointing,"When I listened to this CD, I just went back to listening to 'Vuelve'. There is nothing that really grabbed me in this CD except for Vida Loca. I think Ricky sings with more feeling in Spanish and the lyrics in English just don't sound as meaningful. The song with Madonna was SO BORING, what with all the hype, I really expected it to be a smashing number. Please go back to Spanish, although I am from India, I love the Spanish songs. I think dance songs really go well with Ricky's voice and body, the ballads were pretty wishy washy."
3,because of 'Be Careful (Cuidado Con Mi Corazon)' ...,I actually bought this because of the much talked-about duet of Ricky Martin and Madonna. It wasn't a waste of money. 'Be Careful (Cuidado Con Mi Corazon)' alone was worth it. It eventually made me listen to some of the songs in the album. It wasn't bad. Ricky Martin sings like Jon Secada. Some famous composers and arrangers collaborated with this album.
4,Rickey Martin impresses us with 1st CD,"This CD is not the best thing I've ever heard, but it is very good and it will get a 4 star rating from me. I think that this man is a good example of good latin music. My favourite songs on that CD are: Livin' La Vida Loca, the duet with Madonna, The Cup Of Life, and Maria. Those are the songs that were very good on the CD. But the rest did seem quite unsatisfactory. I had very mixed feelings about this CD but I'll give it 4 stars because of the voice that Ricky Martin had throughout his songs, and the dance beat towards most of the songs. It was a struggle for me to decide whether to give this CD 3 or 4 stars but I gave it 4. I guess I'm being nice. Thanks for reading my review of ""Ricky Martin""."
5,this cd is awesome!,"Ricky Martin has a lot of talant, and he shows it in this cd. He has a #1 single for a reason: his sounds rock. His latin music brings pop to great heights!"
4,Great CD!,"This is a great CD with beautiful lyrics and good beats... I love 'She's All I Ever Had' and ""Shake Your Bon-Bon"". It's an awesome mix of Latin and American beats! I recommend this CD to anyone who loves to dance and who loves the sweetest voice and man in the world...Ricky Martin! This is a great way to start everyday!"
2,it was a'ite,"Okay..well Ricky Martin is hot, tasty, super spicy and all that...but his english album was a little disappointing. I suppose maybe because I was in love with his other Spanish CD's/ Vuelve was the ultimate for me. I mean this album isn't terrible, but he really should stick to spanish. His lyrics, the beat are just too trendy. Too ""pop"" for their own good. I love Ricky and I feel he is super talented, but he wishes to venture into the english world, he should get better wlyric writers and...well.....just different people to work with. I did like his song with madonna. Too bad not many wors were in it"
2,I Expected Better,"I've known/heard Ricky Martin's music for quite some time now.Even when I understood 1/5 of what he was singing about (my spanish ishorrible), I loved the music and the sound and I knew the lyrics were probably comprable. So, imagine my enthusiam when I heard he would be releasing his (inevitable) English album. But, much to my dismay, the album disappoints. Maybe it's that whole ""it loses it's meaning through translation"" thing, because in English, he does nothing for me. Even his catchiest tunes like ""Livin' La Vida Loca"", are made with predicatble manufactured pop lyrics and hooks. The only reason I give it two stars is because there are a FEW songs you can't help but tap your foot to, but you won't remember any of the forgetable lyrics."
5,There isn't one song on this cd that i don't like!,"After hearing la vida loca for the first time, I knew the song would be a hit, and I was pretty sure the cd would be good- I went to the store two days before it was released to reserve my copy and they gave it to me right there! I was already happy, I put the cd in and sang to la vida loca and haven't taken it out of the stereo since!!! I like every song on the cd, his song with Madonna, his three big singles, his semi-ballads--its all great. I keep thinking that i will get sickl of at least one of these songs- BUT I NEVER DO! Buy this Cd now! You won't regret it and you will know exactly what everyone is talking about."
2,??,"This is a pretty average album. I can't understand what all the hype is about. Ricky's god-awful duet with Madonna proves that the Queen of Pop shouldn't sing with people of a lesser talent than herself, which would be, of course, no one. He only brings the potentially beautiful duet down with his album. Otherwise, this mediocre collection has a few high spots, but I really feel as though I wasted my money. ..."
4,"a decent cd, pretty good","Being a fan of ricky for over a year, I had to go out and buy his new cd the first day it came out. It is ok. Livin in (spanish and English) is good, Spanish Eyes is ok, bella is nice, teh duet is pretty nice, I still like La Copa De la vida and Maria, but they are old songs, and I think people need to realize that."
4,UPDATE REVIEW...GREAT CD BUT LACKS LATINO INFLUENCE.,"I reviewed this CD last week, and well I have to say it gets better and better. The CD of course features the #1 smash ""Livin La Vida Loca"", but has other treats as well..my all time favorite ""Maria"" which is featured on his CD ""La Medio Vivir"", and also last years World Cup anthem ""The Cup of Life"", also Ricky does well in ballads with ""You Stay With Me"" which should be the next single, as well as ""Bella"" and ""Private Emotion"". However being an Italian American and liking all kinds of music, I have been a Ricky Martin fan for 6+ years and I have to say this album steers away from his Latin culture, which is the reason I liked Ricky in the first place. One song however ""I Count the Minutes"" sounds so much like Jon Secadas ""Just Another Day"" song and voice it is eerie.... ..."
4,A MARKETING ATOM BOMB!,"The fuse has been lit and now watch out for the explosion! The hysteria surrounding the release of this CD is the wildest I've seen in a long time. Is it deserved? Well, yes and no. The choice of material, production and special guests is flawless. The pacing is right on and the entertainment value soars through the stratosphere. Will this CD change the world? No. But then again it is not meant to. History will probably remember this album not for artistic content but for the shear sales volume. This album will be remembered as The Phantom Menace of the music industry. We'll be hearing hit singles from this CD well into the next century and dancing to remixes of those hit singles for just as long. So don't try to fight it...put your dancing shoes on and give into the rhythm. You will have more fun than you thought you would."
5,Ricky Is Awesome!!,"I love Ricky Martin. He is so talented and his music makes you want to dance and have fun. I have the Vuelve CD and I love it!. I am so proud of him, and how he has shown to the world the talent that comes from my little island Puerto Rico. He makes me even more proud to be Puerto Rican. This CD is great it is fun, romantic and over all AWESOME!! Love you Ricky!!! SAC"
5,Ricky Martin CD,"Ricky Martin Cd, this is an older CD that Ricky Martin made. It is great one of his best ones. I love his music and his salsa style songs as well as his ballads.A+++++++++++++++++++++"
2,We should expect far better from Ricky Martin!,"I know Ricky can do better because he already has. I could listen to ""Vuelve"" all day, every day. But this CD, I want to turn off as soon as ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" finishes. ... It's boring. ....nd like cheesy 80's love songs most of us want to forget. Even the duet with Madonna verges on boring. Unless you're a die hard Ricky fan I suggest buying a single."
4,Ricky can shake those hips!!,"I love this album & VUELVE. I love the song SHE'S ALL I'VE EVER HAD, BE CAREFUL & especially THE CUP OF LIFE. His presentation at the GRAMMY'S was incredible. I literally got goosebumps after he performed. LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA has great rhythm & all, but the words are horrible. I didn't pay much attention to the words at first (probably b/c I was so amazed of his good looks & dance moves) but now I listen to them & they make no sense. Ricky, Ricky, Ricky...I hope your next hit song has some better lyrics!"
1,cheapens latin music,this album does to latin music what pat boone did to rock'n roll -sucks out all the soul in order to make it more palatable to a wider audience -a disgrace!
3,IT's JUST okay.,"My rule of buying a CD is there have to be at least 3 songs that I like. In this one, it just made the bare minimum. Living La Vida Loca, Cup of Life, and Maria. Maria is an old song but since I don't have his other albums so I bought this one. This is why I give it 3 stars."
3,It was okay,"When I heard that he was coming out with a CD I was so excited. When I got it, I was dissapointed. I thinoguth that some of the songs weren't that great, but, he has some songs that are okay. I wouldn't have got it if I heard it before I brought it."
3,i don't think it was as good as it was built up to be.,"Ricky Martin put out another great album! However, I feel that it was not as good asit was built up to be, and I found the duet with Madonna (whom I LOVE!!) was not what I thought it would be! Understand I am not putting down the album, i give it nothing but praise. I can't wait for his next release!"
2,Stick to the spanish Ricky,"I admit the world cup song is very hip but the rest is very flat. I have heard so much about him & was looking forward to this album, but was very disapointed. The Spanish vertions of the songs are great, but the english vertions sound like there is no heart in them."
3,Latino Ricky rocks! (but unfortunatley lacks in pop),"I loved Ricky Martins first song Livin'la vida loca, and I love Ricky Martin. Unfortunatley I must say his album does not live up to Livin la vida loca standards. This is the best song on the album. You'll like this album depending on your taste. If you like Livin' la vida loca for the latino in it you'll love this album, but if you liked it for the pop this album probably isn't for you. Nice try Ricky, hope to see some more poptastic tunes from you in the future."
2,Over Rated,"Ricky Martin has been around for a while, but his first English album leaves much to be desired. Except for the already know hits, ""Livin' La Vida Loca"", ""She's All I Ever Had"", ""The Cup Of Life"" and ""Shake Your Bon-Bon"" the CD doesn't offer much else. Besides these songs get old fast, after a few times they become annoying. The duet with Madonna is horrific in my opinion, and the rest of the album lacks conviction. Looks aren't everything when it comes to good music. He has the looks but lacks in music intensity. Money would be better spent on Enrique Iglesias' new CD Enrique, looks and good music in one. Ricky Martin's CD isn't a total wash, but there are definetely better works out there!"
2,Caviar at McDonald's!,"The problem is not with Martin;the man can sing with inspiration and conviction,he is truly talented,but rather with the ludicrous and dubious market-oriented vibe of this album where the beautiful,passionate and sensual Latino music is butchered and packaged in unsuitable forms.Check out 1998's'Vuelve',a much more honest and emotion-filled Ricky Martin album."
2,Excuse me while I throw up..,"The cheesy hit ""Livin' la Vida Loca"" was kinda of cool, but the rest of this cd is such a nightmare. ""She's All I've Ever Had"" is incredibly sappy and ""Shake Your Bon-Bon"" is rather embarrassing. Diane Warren's contributed ""I Count The Minutes"" isn't much better. Even worse, my mom has a crush on this guy! Argh, stop the insanity!!!! ;)"
3,GOOD TRIP TO FIRST BASE BUT EXPECTED A HOME-RUN....,"RICKY, CORAZON- QUE PASO CON ESE SONIDO LATINO TAN ESPECIAL QUE TE HACE UN CANTANTE TAN DISTINGUIDO, I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING SOME ENGLISH LYRICS WITH A MIXTURE OF LATIN BEATS. I MUST SAY THAT I'VE ENJOYED ALL HIS ALBUMS BUT THIS ONE IS STILL WORKING ON ME... I DONT KNOW IF ITS THIS WHOLE CROSSOVER HYPE,BUT I DID EXPECT A SPECTACULAR ALBUM. SO MUCH WAS BUILT UP FOR THE RELEASE OF THE ALBUM, BUT MY EARS ARE NOT ATTACHED YET. MADONNAS SONG WITH HIM ... THIS ISNT WHAT IM USED TO HEARING FROM TWO ACCREDITED AND RESPECTABLE SINGERS..... OVERALL THE ALBUM WAS OKAY, I THOUGHT THE CROSSOVER WAS GOING TO BE ENGLISH SPOKEN BUT WITH THAT LATIN BEAT THAT MAKES HIM AND HIS MUSIC SO PARTICULAR,ENERGETIC AND AWESOME, INSTEAD I FOUND MYSELF WISHING I HAD JUST KEPT MY SINGLE OF *LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA* AND RECORDED SOMEONE ELSES CD ONTO TAPE.... ..."
1,Maybe I'm missing something...,"but this was yet another Tommy Mottola-inspired move to capitalize on a large Latino population by overhyping a product that can't even stand on its own merits but instead has to rely on its singers looks SOLELY. I'm sorry Ricky, but no, this is the worst album I've bought in a long time. Talk about dispensible, disposable pointless pop music. I'm completely disgusted, and if I could get my money back, I would. The ONLY decent song is the one with Madonna, and really, that's not saying much either."
2,Big disappointment,"I love Ricky Martin and ""Vuelve"" is THE album. Why couldn't he stick with what he's best in, Spanish, latin music? The good beats and the feeling he puts into the Spanish songs are completely missing on this CD. The only good song is ""Livin' la vida loca"". I really hope he's gonna go back to his roots again on the next CD, it would be a shame if he didn't."
3,English pales in comparison to Spanish excellence,"I was expecting more from this CD, as used to I am to the great music of ""A Medio Vivir"" and ""Vuelve"", both of which I love. This album, however, was definitely disappointing. The translation of ""Copa del Amor"" wasn't nearly as good as the original, and the other English songs on the album don't flow as well (either lyrically or musically) as Martin's Spanish songs do. It seems like he's trying too hard to fit into what he thinks American music should be. Stick to the Spanish albums if you want some great music."
2,Vuelve was better,"This one lacks the energy that Vuelve had - He would have been better off sticking to his old style that made him famous in the first place - Only Livin' La Vida Loca comes close. I don't think he will have another hit from here - maybe the Madonna duet as well, but more because of the hype than the song itself."
5,an Awesome cross-over...,"All I can say about this CD is that the album is worth buying even though some of the songs are repeated from singles. Although I give him 5 stars for this english album, I think he should make another spanish album with the same par as vuelve... A music fan from the island of Guam. If you are reading this ricky martin, You did visit guam with your group ( menudo ) in the eighties. I hope sometime you make a visit here and perform for us. Thanks again for the excellent music. Later..."
2,What a disappointment,"In contrast to Vuelve, this disk comes up short. Yes, there are some fun tracks on here, but the overall presentation seems flat and uninspired. Maybe if I were better versed in Spanish, I would find his Spanish language songs as insipid as the English ones on this disk. I was really prepared to like this disk, but while Vuelve will get played over and over again, this one will probably collect dust."
4,"Ricky, ""generate more energy"" Please!!","This is the first Ricky Martin album I've owned. The Fast songs like, ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" and ""Cup of Life"" really boost my energy and make me want to dance and run all day. But the slower songs like the duet with Madonna are just that, too slow. I would have liked to see more fast songs on the album. The slower paced songs should be on a love song album maybe recorded in a few years. Hey Ricky there can only be one Michael Bolton! But, hey for a starting point, Ricky gets two thumbs up!"
2,"i like it, but he can do better","i thought that all his songs would be as fast and cool as ""here We Go', and ""Livin LaVida Loca"" and ""maria"" but those were the only ones (and i already knew them upside inside out..hahahhahahahah lol)"
2,Great Looks Don't Make a Great Artist,"I'm happy to say that I don't own this CD. A friend of mine does, and even he only bought it for ""Livin' La Vida Loca"". He plays the English version and then skips to the Spanish version before ejecting the CD from his player. And that, ladies and gentlemen is the best way to sum up this CD. At best, there are 3 good songs on here: the aforementioned, plus ""The Cup of Life"" and arguably the Madonna duet ""Cuidado con Mi Corazon"". The rest of the CD are run of the mill ballads with about as much lyrical depth as a kiddie pool. And ladies (and gents) if you could stop being fixated on his good looks for more than 2 secs, you'd see there really isn't much to his voice either. I'm not saying he has not talent, but his voice is in no way distinctive and he manages to show little range on the album. This flavor of the month doesn't taste that good in the first place."
3,Better borrow it first before you buy.,"There's too much hype going with this release, there are definitely some other Latin music with superior salsa moves, but I admit I liked ""She's All I Ever Had"", considering Jon Secada contributed in the songwriting. The Madonna duet was alright, too. ... exposure to Latin music with depth, passion, soul, and cultural relevance, I urge listeners to try Celia Cruz, Mark Anthony, La India, or even Luis Miguel (who's pop, but better than this fake crap). When will the youth of today realize that looks do not translate into good musical talent. PLEASE SAVE US FROM FUTURE PAIN; PRODUCE REAL SINGERS LIKE IN THE 50S AND 60S (long live Nancy Wilson, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Dinah Washington, et al.)!!!"
3,RICKY MARTIN IS UNIQUE AND TALENTED!,"I have been a fan of Ricky Martin's since his days with MENUDO. I think he has talent and a lot of charisma. His music is infectious and makes you want to dance. I'll be the first to admit I don't like all the songs,but I like more than half the CD. This CD is worth buying because Ricky showcases his versatility and passion. My son is 4 years old and loves Ricky Martin! I'm 30 years old and I love Ricky Martin! My mom is 58 years old and she loves Ricky Martin! His music appeals to all ages and all races. He is terrific!"
1,"An absolute mess, overrated and what a disappointment!","This album is just boring except for ""Livin La Vida Loca"", and I was not happy to hear old songs from previous years like ""Maria"". In his duet with Madonna ""Be Careful"" his voice sounds awful- off key what an embarrasment. Forget this one, or buy it just for the cover.....Ricky you are hot in the looks department but your music has freezed over."
2,Ricky Martin isnt really a latin,"This album isnt a real latin album. I am embarrased, when people classifised this as latin! Its sounds more like American to me. I am from Norway, and I am fortunate enough, to have discovered REAL latin music on my own. The songs here are redicilus in my opinion, like ""Livin la vida loca"" ""She bangs"" ""shake your bon bon"". The only 2 good songs here(good compares to the rest ...) is Maria and cup of the life.The lyrics doesnt have any depth, and only ""love songs"" or more ""Sex songs"". None political,Poetic songs. NONE! And the music is the same over and over and over again..."
3,Ricky Martin,"If you would have asked me to rate this cd a couple yrs ago, I probably would have givin it a 5, but Ive passed my big Ricky Martin phase, but hes still a pretty good latin singer. I think his best songs are ""Cup Of Life"" wich is a real fun motavating song you might play b4 a football game or something, ""Livin La Vida Loca"" that one, I know youve heard, ""Shes All I Ever Had"" which is a really great slow song, and ""Shake Your Bon Bon"" wich is a good dance song. Youll probably like Ricky Martin if you like No Mercy, Marc Anthony, Enreque Eglasius, or hey, even young Ricky in Menudo!"
2,Truly Disappointed,"In all honesty, I was looking forward to this CD. I remembered him from Menudo (even though I was barely out of diapers), I watched him on General Hospital and thanks to a close Puerto Rican friend, I was familiar with his Spanish works, including his much buzzed about ""Vuelve"". So written from the perspective of someone who was never out to get ""the flavor of the month"", I have to honestly say this was disappointing. The slow songs are boring and the lyrics are so cliche. In ""She's All I Ever Had"", he states, ""She's my lover; she's my friend."" How typical is that? But lyrics and bad melodies aside, the only reason I give it two stars is because there are only 2 half-way decent songs. ""The Cup.."" and ""Livin'..."". The rest of the album is honestly (poorly) manufactured cross-over latin pop. ... But please, look past the pretty face ..."
1,one trick pony,this guy has no musical substance what so ever.his voice is average at best and that's a reach.but the music is pop it's not Latin or African.it's mind rot music.he will be on what ever happened to real soon.
3,Disappointing I like only two songs,"Once again, this is an album that will be purchased for the two hots songs and the rest are duds. The style that makes the two popular ones hot, is not carried through the album. I paid too much for too little."
5,I think this cd is great to play and the songs are beautiful,I think The cd is great! the slow songs are beautiful and they take my breath away. The dance songs get you moving too. Ricky is a very talented singer who has a beautiful voice. You should buy this cd!!!
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I WAS ONE OF MANY WHO WAS MESMERIZED BY RICKY'S PERFORMANCE AT THE GRAMMY'S...WHEN 'VIDA LOCA' WAS RELEASED I WAS HOOKED... I LOVE SPANISH MUSIC & EXPECTED MORE SALSA BEATS AND CONGA RHYTHMS...I WAS TRULY DISPAPPOINTED...I DONT MIND LATIN MUSICIANS CROSSING OVER TO INCREASE THEIR AUDIENCE BASE BUT GIVE US A TASTE OF WHERE YOU COME FROM
5,"It's better than caffeine, after a hard day at work!","So you've had a long, tough day at work -- and the last thing you want to do is sit in traffic? Don't worry! Pop in Ricky Martin's CD and your head and shoulders will begin ""grooving"" while driving home -- not to mention the fact you won't even notice the traffic!"
3,It wasn't what i expected,"I had high expectatives with this CD. What has made Ricky Famous around the world has been that rhythmic melodies with great latin flavor more than the ballads. This CD begins with ""..La Vida Loca"" and quickly puts you on a dance mood then it loses momentum with slow songs..then it tries to catch you again with ""La Copa de la Vida"" and ""Maria"" but at least in the U.S. Hispanic Market those are old songs from previous CDs..The Madonna duet dissapointed..they got the talent to make an smash hit..I wonder if the song was recorded in a rush. The Meja duet is better. After all is a good effort but it's important not to lose focus. Give people what they want."
1,As Chris Rock said...,"""Ricky Martin needs a another hit, like a crackhead needs a hit"". And Chris Rock wasn't lying. He knew what more and more people are beginning to realize is Ricky Martin is a joke. Songs like the patheic ""Private Emotion"", the lame ""She's All I Ever Had"", and the silly ""Shake Your Bon Bon"" are enough to make him my generation's Tom Jones. These songs do NOT stand the test of time and it makes you wonder what was happening in the world during 1999 to make this guy a success. The only good song is ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" and after a while, its gets tiring. Trust me when I say, this album is NOT worth your time."
1,Ricky Martin go home!,"UUGGGHH! Why do people buy this cd? Ricky Martin has no depth, and his lyrics are shallow and meaningless. Words cannot describe how much I hate his songs. Whenever ""Livin la' Vida Loca"" comes on the radio, I just want to reach out and punch somebody. ""The Cup of Life"" is the same few lines repeated over and over again, and ""Shake Your Bon Bon"" has the worst lyrics ever written. For Gods sake, what kind of a title is ""Shake Your Bon Bon""! The only good thing about Ricky Martin is that someday he'll be gone, and that America can turn its attention to some deserving musicians. If your'e a teenybopper loving masochist, then this cd is for you. For all of the rest of you out there though, save your money and get some real music."
5,"great dance beats, sweet love ballads, mix of latin sound","when you hear the songs, you can't help yourself from dancing because the beats are great. i like the latin sound, and the slow love ballads are very good"
4,"Good, but getting away from the latin beat he is known for","I have other CD's by Ricky and this is definitely the one for the US market. It is good, with a good variety of songs and music. Balads, and fast pop music. Too bad he is detouring from the latin beat he had in his last album Vuelve."
5,Ricky and his music is hotter than ever!,"This CD is fantastic. It is upbeat and happy and has that same European taste as the last! ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" is his best song ever, it makes you dance and wanna play it over again. ""Spanish Eyes"" is good too. I think Ricky's best music is on this CD. The fast and vibrant songs are definatley him and are something that he is recognized for. The slow songs I think I have a little bit of getting used to, but I think I'll get there. The use of English on this album is great. We could sing along to his other songs, but not really know what he was saying, so the English is a fantastic idea. Looking forward for a concert in Adelaide Ricky, I'll be first in-line for a ticket! Rock On! Love you!"
2,This is NOT what I expected,I bought this cd thinking it would be a great dance cd. I was wrong! There are only a handful of upbeat songs and the slower ones SUCK! I wish I hadn't bought it....sob....
4,I think Ricky's CD was very exciting,"I really enjoy the CD Ricky Martin. He is so good looking. In fact the best looking guy I've ever seen. The music in his CD is unique and great for having a good time. Livin La vida Loca is my favorite but I also like the Spanish songs as well. I'm an english speaking American girl and I enjoy listening to different types of music. I also think Ricky Martin and his music was such a good idea, America definitley needed a culture pick up! I am 18 and I would like it so much if I could meet Ricky Martin and meet this world wonder!"
5,It is the greatest CD in the world !!!,This CD is probably the best CD I ever had !!! I used to listen to Chinese songs and Ricky's songs are so great that I start to love Latin music !!! I can promise that everyone will love this CD !!!
2,Oh Man...No Way,"I am a fan of Ricky Martin, but I am very disappointed in this CD. The only saving factors for this CD are ""You Stay With Me"", ""I Count The Minutes"" & ""Be Careful""...although I do have reserves using that as a saving factor. I still hold ""Vuelve"" as his best CD...better than ""A Medio Vivir""."
4,Vive La Ricky!,"This is my first ""ricky c.d."" and I love it. It is full of fast paced songs and slow ballads. After reading other interviews that dissed him, I had second thoughts about whether or not to buy it, but I am happy I did! I have to say that the Madonna duet disappointed me. But that might just be because I had expected it to be faster. The duet with Meja rocked. All in all, the whole c.d. rocked!"
1,Very disappointing!,"Living la vida loca is an excellent song, but the rest of the CD is pathetic, if not downright irritating. I am a DJ and buy music to complement my collection of music. The only song that I can see myself using is the above-mentioned song. If that is the best that Ricky Martin can do, then perhaps it would be better if he stayed overseas."
1,IS THIS THE BEST YOU CAN DO?,"This CD is not what I expected from Ricky. The quality of it is very low. Only trying to impress the Anglo, and dissapointing your true fans. Repeating Spanigh songs that made you famous in your ""NEW"" english CD makes me so mad. It was a waste of my money buying your new CD. Last comment: Ricky Martin nunca seras tan grande como Luis Miguel, que si es verdadero cantante. Tiene mejor voz que tu y es mucho mas guapo. Y sera simpre el Rey."
5,This CD is a must have!!!,"Ricky's Cd is a must have for any music lover!!! Uptempo songs like Livin' Livida loca and Shake your Bon Bon are wonderful, although my choice track is She's all I ever had. The music and lyrics to it are awsome"
3,"The established hits were great, the new songs, only so, so.","I was really looking forward to this album. I love his hit ""La Vida Loca"" and have enjoyed his previous latin hits, including Vuelve. I was glad to see that the CD included ""La Copa De La Vida"", and ""Maria"", they have great rythm. I was, however, completely unimpressed with all of the love ballads, they left me cold. The duet with Madonna was not what I expected either. It left me wishing they had considered other songs before recording it. It was boring and uninteresting. Madonna has a great voice, Ricky however, doesn't. The music arrangements for most of his previous releases have been complimenary to his style of singing, this time Ricky could not deliver."
5,Hes the best!,"Ricky Martin is the hottest, and one of the best singers ever! Everyone needs his CD! His music is ful of excitment, and its great to dance too."
2,Buy the maxi-single instead!,"If you're expecting this album to be as good as his first US single ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" you're in for a disapointment. It definately lacks the energy of that single or any of his older stuff like ""Cup of Life"" . It's full of a bunch of cheesy ballads any one of those boy bands have probably already done and lacks the latin flavor of his previous stuff. However, the ballad with Madonna and the booklet alone (for the yummy pictures) make it a must have for any gay boys out there."
3,A pretty decent LP,"It's not quite what you expect of a much-hyped album. ""Ricky Martin"" is good, but an obvious rebuttal to the American bubble gum pop that has been clogging the airwaves since the ubiqutous Backstreet Boys debuted. Only this time, we get a more spicy-cinnaminy flavored ounce of bubble-blowing fun! Eh, all-in-all the album is basically what anyone would expect of a Spanish-English crossover. Some tracks are not quite up to Martin's standard, especially the hastily recorded track featuring Madonna. The techno-electronica sounds of ""Ray of Light"" blatantly overshadow the upbeat-salsa sounds Martin has to offer on the track. Other songs are in the usual Ricky-format most of his fans have come to know and love; and that would be the energetic, fast-paced tempos that evoke a feeling of ""getting jiggy wit' it"" - latino style."
3,The hot latino is on fire!,"I have to admit have been a fan of Ricky Martin back in the day, and those of you who are just starting to like him you missed out in his past. This cd has a totally different pace (slower) than Vuelve, which i think is a caliente cd. I love it how he brought his culture into this album being a latina i am very proud of him. VIVA PUERTO RICO!!!! Mi amor, felicidades."
2,I guess you have to like spanish to love this CD.,"I'll admit Ricky Martin is sooooooooo fine, but not his music. Sure you here Livin La Vida Loca on the radio all the time, but that and Be Careful are about the only good songs you'll find. I expected more upbeat songs like Livin La Vida Loca on there, but most of them were slower, way slower songs."
3,Refreshing,This album is once again proof that refreshing music can still be heard and written in the style of those 70's and 80's artists. Invigorating and meaningful.
2,Ok..... But....,"Well, this CD is okay... BUT the music is too noisy....! When I first listened to it, it nearly drive me nuts....! Too much background music I supposed. But luckily, there are a few songs which I really like and they are ""Spanish Eyes"", ""She's All I Ever Had"" and ""Cup Of Life""... Generally this CD is nice except for a few negative points which I had pointed out earlier."
2,Well what can i say,"This Cd doesn't worth ur money there are good songs there few livin la vida loca,siaieh,maria,the cup of life and the song with meja the other songs he sounds like he's singin far away from the mic good thing i borrewed it i thought about buying it so i made good choice"
3,One song grows on you...,"and that one song is ""All I ever need"". This one song saves the album from being ordinary. Lyrics and music go hand in hand and make this number one of the best in recent times. Ricky is in his elements for this number. I could listen to only ""Maria"" and ""Living la vida loca"". The rest of the songs just seem to be there to fill empty spaces between the good ones."
1,VERY disappointed!!!,"I was expecting a better album by Ricky although I alredy knew that his voice is limited;nevertheless with proper songs He can sound great. Unfortunately the songs in this album aren't the appropiate for him,all the ballads sound boredspecially the duet with Madonna(a totally waste of time)something like Ray of light would have been better.I hope his next album emends all the mistakes made in this one because He is a good performer full of energy and Livin' la vida loca isjust SUPERB!!!."
3,Not exactly what I expected!,"After listening to this CD I was a bit disappointed and wasn't exactly sure if it was worth all the hype. I really like ""La Vida Loca"" and ""She's all I ever had"" but other than that the other songs are not exactly his style. The duet with Madonna was more Madonna's sound than his and that kind of bothered me. I own a couple of his Spanish CD's which I think are great so I may have to give this new CD another try before I make up my mind but the first impression was not good."
2,What a huge disappointment,The excitement and beauty of his music falls so short when translated into English. His upbeat salsa music sounds flat (compare the two versions of Livin' La Vida Loca and you'll see); his ballads sound like bubblegum music--more from his Menudo days than from his last CD Vuelve. His duet with Madonna is remarkably boring. ...
1,Don't judge a video by it's...,"If you're expecting a video on primitive hunting, look elsewhere! The video shows no actual hunting at all. It is simply another discourse in hunting apologetics. A disappointing piece of work interviewing guru-like ""professional hunters"" on how it ""feels"" to hunt. If you don't already know, then you are in the wrong section of the video store."
3,Disappointed,"Though the graphic is great, the size is not. Did not expect it to be so small. I would not call this a poster. This is a graphic printed on a nice piece of paper."
3,Was fun to assemble,"My 5 year old son received this for Christmas of 2004. He was very excited to put it together and did so by himself. We ran into some problems though. The clear panel on it won't stay in. The pre-drilled holes on the base were a little too far apart and the panel falls out, making it useless for putting food in. We have yet to fix it. There is also no way to hang the feeder. My Husband says it won't take much to put hooks on it. I think it should have come with some. The quality of the wood and tools are wonderful. Perfect for kids to use. Our kit was just a little off."
3,Great story with mediocre writing,"There is no doubt that the story of Charles Mulli is intriguing and captivating. I had a difficult time putting it down for the most part. However, the largest contributing factor to my wanting to stop reading was the incessant sentence breaks. All too often throughout the book, I was distracted from the amazing story by sentences placed awkwardly for - dramatic impact. Yes, impact. So frequent, and unnecessary. Why was it there? It had to be. But why? Because. Just because.That was my only complaint about the book. I got the impression that Paul Boge was telling me about a great man and his work, but he was doing so with crayons and stick people.Again, if you want to know about Charles Mulli and his foundation, the book is good. If you're looking for solid writing structure and a well written story, the book falls short."
5,Couldn't stop reading!,"I read this book in one evening. It was so good I couldn't stop. Powerful!!! If this doesn't show what God can do through a surrendered life, I don't know what will."
3,A Great Kids' Dictionary,"This dictionary is beautifully legible. However, there are no children in our household. We are just two Scrabble-playing, college-educated adults, and almost none of the words we look up in the ""Oxford American Large Print Dictionary"" are there. Based on the ""Oxford American Minidictionary,"" 2004, this large-print edition offers no etymologies. I bought this dictionary for my very nearsighted husband, but he never uses it. When he wants to look up a word, he does what he's always done: he pulls the ""Webster's Collegiate"" down from the shelf and reaches for the magnifying glass."
4,Good dictionary with limitations,"It's just the nature of the beast, a large print dictionary would be gigantic if it was truly comprehensive. The Oxford American Large Print Dictionary is a reasonable choice. considering the inherent limitations. The font is large and crisp, the layout is clean, the paper is decent quality but the definitions are brief and you won't find every word you're looking for. Not every word used in the definitions are defined themselves."
4,Just the book we were looking for,The Oxford American Large Print Dictionary is just the book we were looking for. We are losing our eyesight and need all the helps we can get.
4,i stumbled upon this 1...,"i was on iTunes (as i am most of the time) and stumbled upon this album due 2 a ""referral"" and i have 2 tell u, it's completely worth every penny i spent! i've been a huge fan of bossa nova 4 a few years now and this guy's sound is very close 2 the original stuff (or the closest i've heard thus far). his voice seems 2 melt over the music like butter (ok that was corny). my favorite song on this album is ""Pousada"". so, check this out if u're up 2 hearing what the new sound of brazil has 2 offer!"
3,Lady Day is to Madeleine Peyroux as Caetano Veloso is to...,"This would be Caetano's best album since ""Livro"" if it were really him. Nothing ground breaking here, but as usual with Brazilian music, it's the subtleties that make this a pleasant listen. That is, if you can get past Mr. Fonseca's voice sounding exactly like Caetano Veloso's. On his previous albums, it was nowhere near this pronounced. I liked Jon Faddis a lot better once Diz passed."
3,Almost paper thin,"The mousepad is almost paper thin. It's functional and will work for my purposes ... but it is not like other mouse pads. Since I paid less than a fiver, that's OK.I didn't hit the lottery like the previous reviewer -- only one was in the package. The pads are so thin, maybe they can stick together?"
1,What the.....?,"This guy can't even put words together to from coherent sentences, so you can imagine just how wretched his excuse for music is. Avoid at all costs."
2,The CD isn't all that good,"Jesse is deffinately the best VJ on MTV, but he really isn't that great of a singer. He's like a mix of Metallica and Britney Spears. He should stick to MTV, doing his little rock n' comedy bit. I don't think we'll be seeing this around much longer."
2,It's like dental surgery,"The only thing that tempted me to buy this album is the duet between MTV boy Jesse and legendary Stevie Nicks...which is definatly the best track on the album. However Stevie's voice is not flattered by Jesse's ""sense of harmony"". The album itself consists of Jesse screaming at the top of his lungs emiting a not very pleasent sound...some songs are written deciently and sometimes the musical arrangements are tolerable but for the most part...go buy a Stevie Nicks album! :)"
1,what a joke,This is nothing but hype - If the guy wasn't attached to MTV the disc would never see the light of day
2,Not totally tooth-grindingly bad,"While marshmellow'd to the core, most of the songs in this CD are not terrible. They are very sophisticated little nuggets of ruminations on coal miners and Welsh Artic seals. My favorite is the one about Jesse dreaming of going to heaven with all the creatures in the forest. Jesse is an OK person, if maybe a little short."
1,Too bad I couldnt go lower,It breaks my heart that one star is the lowest you can go. This is easily one of the worst cd's I have ever heard. I hated this guy as a VJ and now I hate him as an artist. Shame on anyone who has purchased this album.
5,JESSE YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jesse, you are so awesome!!!!!!!! i love the song ""See You Around"" and i cant wait till the cd comes out!!!! Jesse if your reading this I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"This stapler requires daily oiling, which is not stated in the Amazon description nor on the DeWalt website. The better tools in this class are oil-free.This tool comes with NO air fitting. You need to go buy an air nipple before you can use it. Again, the better tools in the class come with a swiveling air fitting.The better tools also have a belt hook, which the DeWalt doesn't.Yes, this tool is inexpensive. And for good reason. Do yourself a favor and buy a better tool.DeWalt also did not answer my email and does not have a phone number listed for customer support/information."
4,How to design electoral districts to win,"Creating electoral districts to aid the party controlling the state legislature is a practice that goes back in U. S. history at least to the early 19th century. Monmonier gives a simple, easy- to-follow example of how it can be done, using simple diagrams."
3,packaging different only,"This dvd is the exact same one as the 1998 version. The only difference being the cardboard sleeve pictured. Once you take off the sleeve, it's the same dvd case as the earlier one. So beware, this dvd for collectors only!!! Those willing to pay 18 bucks for a piece of cardboard!!!"
5,Pandora's Box,This is a puzzle that the whole family can play. It is a 3-d game.It is very good for hand-eye coordination as well a thinking game. My grandsons and I play this and we each come up with a different way of solveing the puzzles. I just hope I can find another game that is as riveting as this one is.
4,Mind Exerciser,"I like this game. The puzzles get a bit repetitive in that they are variations of the same type. But the content is so interesting, and you get to travel all over the world and visit places while challenging your mind. The graphics are quite beautiful and varied."
3,"mediocre, grows tiresome easily","For twenty bucks, I wasn't expecting the world. I was expecting more than prettied-up jigsaw puzzles, though. This is the try-to-exhaustion kind of game, not much strategizing involved. Get the ancient ""Ishido"" instead (if you can find it), it's much more creative."
5,Best Game I ever owned !!!!,"Absolutely fascinating puzzles,, most unique and best game I ever purchased....."
4,Enjoyed it enough to give as a gift - twice!,"This was the very first ""puzzle game"" I had ever purchased for the computer and I personally enjoyed all the different formats the puzzles came in as well as the fact that many of them were beautiful works of art once completed. I wish that there were more computer games such as this for adults that do not wish to just partake in military or sci-fi styles of computer games. I love the old ""load and go"" type of games that don't take a year to understand and play. Bought it for my Brother-in-law as well as my Father and they too enjoyed it throughly."
5,Give me more!,"Our family has delighted in playing this game for several years. We've enjoyed the variety of puzzles and the various challenges offered at each of the levels. And beyond that, we've enjoyed the photography and art that is featured in the games. I have looked in vain for other computer games that are as enjoyable...until I saw that there is a millenium edition of Pandora's Box with 40 more games. I am so disappointed that I can't find a copy that I plan to search for a used one. After 7th Guest and 11th hour games were exhaused, we revelled in Pandora's Box. I long for more of these challenging types of computer games."
4,It was fun!,"Pandora's Box is the type of game that starts easy and ends hard. If you don't mind having to sit through the easy levels to get to the hard ones, this game will definately be worth your while. If not, then you can just do the puzzles and not the game. Either way, I think everyone will be satisfied with this product."
2,I found this book very introductory.,"I'm new to car audio and this book doesn't teach me anything more than what I've learned from articles on howstuffworks.com, sounddomain.com etc. Besides, his overly use of not-so-funny jokes really drives me nuts (even the author admits his jokes are corny). I also picked up ""The Car Stereo Cookbook"", a book along the same line but a little bit more up-to-date and informative."
3,Good Book for a beginner- intermediate,"Good book but still there are some questions that may remain unanswered. The book does not explain that good the various ways of conecting speakers to amps meaning the total watts that may come out of a channel, that sort of thing.More diagrams of actual conections would make an even nicer book. On the other side for a beginner is a very good book, for someone who just really started on this hobby. And still it gives a good tecnical explanation of crossovers, but as the title of the book mentioned is a book for beginners."
3,Good book for building speaker boxes.,"This book has an excellent section on designing speaker boxes, wich is going to save you money. I also liked the section explaining impedance, and connecting speakers in patterns. I did not like the chapter on shortwave radio. I thought the section on crossovers was too technical."
3,Technically poor,"I think this book is technically poor. The author seems to concentrate on installations which he has carried out for friends and family, about four in all."
5,Spellbinding,"One of the most satifying interpretations of early music I've ever heard. Maria Lafitte's vocals still chill me after many listenings, and the instrumentalists' performance is outstanding.Try samples #5 & #2 for particularly good tastes."
2,Caveat emptor!,"The musicians are swell here. HOWEVER, the soprano or whatever she is really grating. Listen to Track 3 if you don't agree. She pretty much ruined an otherwise nice record. So, I can't recommend this early music CD. I expected men singers, as noted in a review above. If you want to hear a woman who can sing well, check out ""On the Banks of Helicon"" by the Baltimore Consort. Unless you like shrill French words hurled in your direction."
2,I was disappointed,"If I buy Troubadour music, I expect listening was to men's voices. Well, I was disppointed because the singer on this album is a woman, so it was not what I expected."
2,It's like listening to a catfight!,"Ugh! I'm a big fan of Medieval music, but this has got to be some of the worst singing I've heard on such a CD. I'm guessing the lady was thinking of how, with modern rock music, often the singers will wander from the original melody and rythm a bit. But I stress here A BIT -- that doesn't mean these should be turned into pseudo-rap, or bad poetry. She totally just starts SCREAMING certain songs -- trying maybe to communicate the emotion?Also (and I noticed in the liner notes that the group often does Middle Easter music) there was a sort of unpleasant Turkish/Indian style to the improv that I didn't like.My final complaint is that it is a woman singing all these songs -- these songs were meant for men to sing. I don't think the lyrics were even altered to match."
1,do not buy,"Don't waste your money by buying this small pamphlet. It isn't a book but rather a few pages stapled together probably costing only a few cents to make. It attempts to cover far too much information in its few pages and therefore the techniques aren't explained in any detail and are therefore useless. What's more, psychologists have pretty much proven that photographic memories do not actually exist and therefore the claims are bogus. The first two reviewers are in all probability part of the group of people trying to rip people off of there hard owned money so they themselves can afford to live in pacific palisades where the supposed company is based."
1,...,"Not only does this book show you the INSTANT MEMORY technique, it also covers the following topics:""How to release your photographic memory""""The secret of passing examinations""""How to play any musical instrument""""How to win at sports""""How to overcome timidity, self-consciousness and lack of confidence""""How to overcome stage-fright""""How to conquer fatigue and depression""""How to win at card games, chess, etc""""How to overcome unwanted habits""""How to unlock forgotten memories""""How to find lost articles""""How to awaken without an alarm clock""""How to give a speech""""How to increase your powers of observation""""The secret of speed reading""Yep, these are the actual chapter titles. Does this sound a bit unrealistic for a 60-page pamphlet stapled together with the isbn stamped on the front cover? Answer: yes.Let me be more clear: This book is complete BS (and HS)."
2,this is not what you think....,i ordered this thinking it would be a lot more about Harry Potter but it's sort of a pseudo documentary that's not very good. There are a couple good segments and it's a little interesting but i would have MUCH preferred to hear about JK Rowling and the Harry Potter characters more than the 'possible' places and people she might have been writing about. i thought it was okay but my kids thought it was super lame!
4,The Real World of Harry Potter,"I did like this DVD but do wish it had been close-captioned. Sometimes the Brits are hard to understand, especially when one has hearing problems, even with hearing aids!"
2,Maybe not the best,"I got this DVD for myself and my 4 obsessed children, hoping to see more of the real places mentioned in the books - like a little travelogue perhaps, as well as more about the author, and some discussion of the myriad references to mythology in the books. There was some of that, but there was also a great deal of a fellow in robes calling himself ""The White Witch"" talking about wicca and how his wand works, etc., which was not at all what I was looking for. I wound up not letting the children watch it at all, as the good did not balance out the bad."
1,Rented from the library and still feel a bit cheated,"I was hoping that this video would have done 2 things: 1, given me a bit of a tour of the filming locations, like Christ's Church, Gloucester Cathedral, Glenfinnan Viaduct, and more and 2. given me a bit of history that led to the book, both mythic in telling and in real locations like Wookey Hole Cave. Basically, I wanted a fan tour without having to pay the 2-3K it costs to actually do that. Instead, I was given sort of ""this is the junk we have in our pocket"" presentation. It's not worth your money, unless you're REALLY interested in listening to some guy who calls himself the ""white witch"" babel on about proper broom flying technique. I suppose the author date should have clued me in that it wasn't likely too be all that useful, but I'm still disappointed (to the point I signed on to author this review), and I watched this for free."
4,consigase un diccionario,El libro es MUY MUY MUY MUY BUENO pero solo le di cuatro estellas porque para los que vivimos en un pais donde el primer idioma no es el espanol y uno no tiene un vocabilario muy nutrido el libro en muy dificil de entender y tiene que leer un parafo dos o tres veces para poder entender lo que el autor esta tratando de ensenar. Pero la verdad que aprendi mucho con este libro y con la clase que tome en el instituto. Lo recomiendo pero NO OLVIDE COMPRARSE UN DICCIONARIO DE ESPANOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
5,"If you like D&D style games, this is a perfect spoof.","This was one on my favorite episodes for two reasons. One, it made fun of the D&D style computer games on the market. Two, Mike the T.V. had a bigger role than in some of the other episodes. The two mixed together was hilarious."
1,Don't let this one be the first episode of Reboot you see...,"Don't get me wrong, I love the TV show Reboot, but this episode was stupid and rediculous, it seemed like the producers were just try to take up time by making this episode... If you want to see a good episode, watch the Medusa bug, that one it much better."
3,A Fly in the Ointment,"This recording has much to recommend it: Mirella Freni at her freshest - her later von Karajan recording may show the character of Mimi better but her voice absolutely soars here. The Rome Opera orchestra under Thomas Shippers is superb. The sound is excellent for a recording from the early 60s and the supporting cast is more than adequate. So why not more stars? The reason is Nicolai Gedda's Rodolfo. He sings well but his characterization sounds more apropriate for one of his famous operetta recordings. There is no pathos in his performance and his sincerity doesn't come through. Granted, it's one flaw in an otherwise superb recording but it's a big flaw!!"
2,Mine Doesn't Whistle!,"Very disappointed. I really wanted this housewarming gift to work...because the color and design are beautiful. Unfortunately, this tea kettle does not whistle.If you are looking for beauty as well as Function, I would not recommend this. Any pot can boil water!"
4,Cute Little Teapot,"Looks great on my stove, not too small, not too large. Great bright white color. Looks cute in a country cottage kitchen. Heats up quickly. Just be careful not to touch the lid sprout. Boiling makes it very hot. But you can pour the hot water without touching it. Its perfect for me!!"
2,Poor quality eventhough its pretty,I agree its looks real good.But very poor quality. Mine I received with a small whole in it and the manual says you have to keep it wipe & DRY after each use otherwise it will RUST!!! if we can't keep water in a tea kettle then whats the point!!..I bought it to keep the boiled water since I can't do that I returned.
1,This teapot doesn't whistle- just looks pretty MOD,"I 'm writing this review the day after Xmas 2005. We wrote on a family pollyanna we wanted a ""whistling tea kettle"". A relative gave us this. I just used it to make my favorite tea- Barrys Irish. The person who wrote the last review was right- it DOESN'T whistle! Also the lid doesn't go down after you press the lever. I had to manual squash it down. I followed the directions- I mean this isn't rocket science. The whole point is to get a sound so I know the water is boiling. I am going to be donating this to the thrift store and buying another brand that DOES work. We previously had a Revereware kettle that worked until the whistle part fell out and down a black hole in the stove. I am sad because this clearly is a defective product and should not be sold as a whistling kettle. I wish they had a no star option on this review. I let it pass for one star because I liked the chartreuse green color."
4,4 stars for shape and color!!,i love the shape and the color....unfortunately my son boiled water one night for probably one hour before we figured out that the whistler did'nt work!!! this was the first time it was used....so what to do????i can handle the whistle not working only because i love the shape and color and i'm dreading the post office line to return the item...this is so cute!....maybe i should have purchased the le creuset kettle for about 40.00...it was red too!!!i think red is so hot!if you have to have a whistler.....here's hoping you will get one that whistles away your first use!!
2,Material sloughed off--buy with caution,"This tea kettle (which I purchased in white) served us well for about a year; it was fairly durable and did not rust on the inside. The handle and pour spout were also well designed. We often used it several times a week to make coffee and tea with no apparent problems. However, I recently discovered, to my dismay, that whatever material this kettle is made of/coated in was sloughing off on the inside. In other words, when I touched the inside of the pot, it felt grainy, as though coated in fine sand, and my finger came away looking like I had dipped it in white paint. Needless to say, I promptly threw it away. To me, this does not suggest a reasonable standard of craftsmanship. I don't want to use a kettle that might endanger my family's health."
4,"Red HotWhen I needed a new kettle, I looked in the better Malls","When I needed a new kettle, I checked out the better Mall stores. Anything that impressed was also overpriced. The collection on Amazon was truly impressive.I choose by looks and function. It sits there in all its red, round glory. It sits on my glass top stove like a piece of art. The fit of spout cover does not allow it to whistle.The steam comes out and runs down the kettle, to the stove. Be very cautious when refilling. Wait till it cools down or the steam rises up to the handle - with you hand on it.I still love it but you have to be really careful or you will get burned. Not for kids."
5,A thrilling performance!,I've been waiting for years for this version of Die Fledermaus to be available on DVD. I've seen countless performances by various artists but this is by far my favorite. Eberhard Wachter IS Eisenstein. Otto Schenk is masterful both as the jailor and as the director. It is a joy to watch!
5,A pleasure to see & listen to,"This is an uplifting opera that I could watch over & over again. The subtitles were an added plus, but the music, singing and theme of the opera made it enchanting. This is asolutely one of my favorites, and is very helpful when lending to someone who wants to get interested in opera."
3,more early music style than polyphony,"I love Latin ecclesiastical polyphony (Palestrina, des Spres, Byrd, etc.), but this has much more the early music ancient folk sound than the transcendent ecclesiastical style. Whether this is a plus or minus depends on your preference: de gustibus non est disputandem. The cover is rather captivating in an entirely concupiscent sort of way, too."
3,"Good, but could have been better.","The video and audio quality of this collection was excellent. The videos included in the Desktop Collection were very entertaining, even though I'd seen most of them before. It was the 2nd Wind Recording Sessions which left me disappointed. All the commentary before each song, explaining a bit about the song, was interesting. The disappointment came when the performances of the songs were cut to about a minute or less. I was looking forward to seeing and hearing how each song on the album was performed. Thus, if you are a fan of the 2nd Wind CD, don't bother buying this DVD."
1,Is this a Joke?,"Live?!Well that's what the packaging says. There is a complete setlist written on the back. The description says its a live performance. But, they failed to tell me there was only 15 seconds of each song. Thats right, 15 SECONDS.Each track begins with a loose explination of the song by Todd. The band starts to play the song, then, out of nowhere it 'fades' into the next track.I don't really know the reason for selling a live performance that is missing the performance. I think I just got ripped off, and if I could get my money back, I would."
2,Welll,"Spare me all the political commentary. I got through about 1/3 of this disc and gave it the shepherds hook. I'm a life long musician and have a large collection of concert DVD's and have been listening to Todd for over 20 years, but this just turned me off."
5,a really interesting work,"The book centers around a thesis that revisionism has overshadowed the actual in the telling of the stories concerning the orgins of Blues music. It also presents factual historical citations concerning how overrated the legacy of legendary bluesman Robert Johnson was actually contrived and begat from the revisionism of the white blues revivalists back in the sixties. It sheds light and presents many interesting details concerning these performers and their environment at the time. One of the most rewarding things is getting my hands on some of the artists referred to in this book: Ma Rainey, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and others mentioned and discussed in this book.Read it cos I haven't been able to put it down!"
5,Really nice flute case!,"I purchased this flute case for my daughter, whose old flute case was literally falling apart! This Slimline was as nice as any I'd seen in the stores but so much cheaper through Amazon! She loves it!"
3,Good but can't fit gizmo key? Manufacturer also makes candy?,"Sturdy and lightweight, but the height is too low for my footjoint's gizmo key (dangerously under stress when case is zipped closed) and it's also uncomfortably small for my G# key. The interior also smells strongly of malt balls and chocolate candy. The fragrant's stuck to my flute and now whenever I play I think of Hershey's Whoppers melted with Kisses, whilst salivating copiously over the lip plate. Has anyone else had these issues?"
4,Resister test,"I purchased this resister due to the fact that I purchased a blower from an Amazon competitor that stated that the reason their blower failed in basically less than two weeks of use was due to a short in the resistor or some other area. I removed the resistor and tested it as well as this unit. This unit is slightly out of the manufacture specifications listed in the manual and my old resistor had no shorts and was closer to the manufacture tolerances. Needless to say that I purchased the blower from a competitor because Amazon stated there would be weeks before their blower was available. Regardless, it was already a hot summer so I went the quickest route. The second time around, Amazon had them in stock and I purchased the blower from Amazon. No complaints and we have been using blower almost every day for A/C. Check out the review for the blower in that section."
2,Not instant.,I bought this earlier this month and wanted to use it for baking one day but when I put it in the temperature changed VERY slowly. It took about 2 minutes before the temperature rose to around 145. I do understand that I may have received a defective product and I hope Amazon can address this issue but at least for my purchase it did not live up to what it advertised.
2,Stopped working,I was very happy with this thermometer until it stopped working. I liked the large numbers on the easy to read face but it stopped working after only a few uses. It got stuck and is now off by about 50 degrees. If the needle is twisted between two fingers the dial can be moved. Just too cheaply made.
2,"So far, not so good...","We've only used this a handful of times so far, but it's had mediocre results in both speed and accuracy when used on meat."
2,internally fragile,"Within the first couple of weeks of using it as a tea thermometer, I found that tapping on the dial lightly will cause the needle to jump by up to 20 degrees. It still seems to work somewhat, but it's hard to really trust a thermometer that can be so easily convinced to adjust itself by 20 degrees one way or the other.As other reviewers have noted, it is also fairly slow, even in water (which conducts heat pretty well)."
3,Easy to read Dial But READ the Specs Before using,It's accurate and easy to use. Problem is if you don't read the specs you will fail to note it's plastic not glass and melts pretty quickly if left in th eoven for several minutes!
2,Incredibly slow!,"The unit we received takes a long time to register, far too long to be useful. And, it needs to be inserted too far to, for example, check a hamburger or a chicken breast. It does seem accurate or it would only get one star."
3,It's ok...but...,"I have another CDN Insta-Read and the movement on this one compared to my older one was surprising...This one jerked its way to the final temperature reading, while the older one exhibits a very smooth movement. It might be just the one thermometer that I got (wouldn't ya know)...but I thought I would post this as a potential warning."
3,for cooking,"You cannot leave this in the meat while cooking, it will melt. However it is accurate but you have to open the cooker to get the results."
2,Look Elsewhere,"Duane Crowther is styled as an LDS Scholar, but his books amount to little more than paraphrasing, prooftexting, and list making- ESPECIALLY list making! His penchant for lists and endless quoting is taken to the extreme. If you're looking for academic critical thinking you won't find it here. If you're looking for inspiration you're better off (as is almost always the case) in sticking with the scriptures. A perusal of the Topical Guide in any set of LDS Scriptures will give you what Crowther gives you. However, ""Life Everlasting"" isn't as bad as some of his later books, for that I give it one extra star."
2,"interesting to watch, less interesting for your ear","The first violin concerto by Prokofiev is a great masterpiece. It is very virtuous and hard to play correctly (interpretation). It's interesting to watch somebody play it owing to its difficulties but I don't like the way Repin plays it at all, it's not very intelligent and sounds like he learned very well technically from his teacher but without any personal thoughts, feelings or empathy for the piece itself. Saw him live once play #1 by Shostakovitch which was little better compared to this one but still played in a very rough way. (Compare to recordings by Mintz or Stern that you'll find on CD).Another thing I have to criticise: When the soloist plays the most interesting parts of the concerto, the camera goes to the tubas and other members of the stage to show them or tapes Repin from his back where you can't see a damned thing!"
3,Nice pack for the money.,"I needed a medium size pack for all my snowmobile riding stuff. Pack shovel, probe, spare gloves, snowbungie, etc. I had already spent a ton of cash on those items, so was a little shocked to see that a pack like the North Face Patrol is $150 retail, and only $95 on sale.This pack is not really in that league, but it seems to be well made. Plenty of straps, loops and buckles on the outside to strap down whatever you could imagine.Pack has one large main compartment, and an outer expansion part with a partial divider. There is a zippered top compartment which will be great for keys, wallet and GPS.Some day I hope to be able to afford the patrol pack, but for now I'm styllin' with this cheepo."
1,not for backpacking,"this pack fell apart on first use, webbing pulled off, zippers broke. i bought it back in 2007, cant believe it is still for sale!"
2,an okay start,although i had stretched the limits of this bag by taking it on a 15 day backpacking tour of europe it did not hold up very well. i had only filled the bag with 3 days worth of clothes and essential survival necessities. being a soldier and veteran of deployments i am not exaggerating when i say bare essentials. this bag had a ripped top handle within 3 days and would sustain many more rips in seams as the trip progressed. it did make the tour but barely. if your looking to do something as rugged invest the money for a tougher pack. this is ideal for a quick hike through some woods that you might spend the night. much past that its weight capacity to size ratio is deceiving
1,Not worth the money.,I think I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $25/$27 for this....definitely not worth it. I thought perhaps it was something special and that my life and language would be enriched by reading it...but I was mistaken. WAY overpriced and overrated.
4,Rarely heard music from Great Britain,"Sir Arthur Bliss is also given a trilogy on 8.553698: Discourse for Orchestra (revised version), Miracle in the Gorbals (complete ballet score), and Music from ""Things to Come."" None of these versions have ever been recorded before and these scores are very interesting. The ballet and film scores, however, are in a sort of artistic limbo since the music makes little sense without your knowing what visuals are attached to it, so to speak. Although we are told the scenario of each movement of ""Miracle,"" the music does not stand as much on its own as do ballet scores by Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky. For collectors of the rare. Christopher Lyndon-Gee conducts the Queensland Symphony Orchestra."
1,misleading information,"Your web-page is misleading. It quotes, and the image displays, the Middle English original of the poem. The inside pages shown are from the Middle English edition. However, (and the modernized title should be a giveaway, but it wasn't) the edition on this page is in modern English -- a translation, not Chaucer's poem. You need to clean up this page, take away the Middle English quotations, state that it's a modern translation, and refer the prospective buyer to the actual, modernized edition -- which the buyer may or may not want (in my case I did not), with assistance in finding the actual Middle English masterpiece."
1,funniest tales censored by omission,"the miller's and reeve's tales are missing from this edition, probably because of the coarse nature of cuckoldry, etc. consequently, this edition is severely lacking in humor compared to unabridged editions."
1,This guy is a complete fraud,"This guy is a complete fraud. If you want a sample of his writing, read the first three reviews written as he wrote them. Note the consistent spelling errors and broken english, [...]If you want to read the concepts in clear english, go pick up any Anthony Robbins book as this is where Christopher Howard copies most of his information from... and who he models his life after. Unfortunately Christopher Howard is at best a cheap imitation of Anthony Robbins."
4,The Tv Series Patlabor the Mobile Police,"Patlabor is a funny old tv series decipting the personal relations and the cases that the mobile police go through. The first episode on this tape introduces the character Takeo Kumagami. It is it's own little story the second episode is about a training op in an old building that they stay at. The house is creepy, the Ingrams (their big robots) are sluggish, and voices are heard in the darkness. the third episode starts a small story that is not concluded in the tape about a new labor that is designed and built, but not for constuction purposes. the fourth episode is a funny one about the plight of the special vehicles devision caused by ordering chinese takeout the last episode continues the story started in the third one. Not much happens. a long tape and a funny tape"
5,Great Movie,Great movie the scene about bread and how to butter it is beautiful full of suspense and wonderful music
4,Sometimes you have to let art just flow over you...,"If you focus entirely on the story, the intertwining plots occasionally cause Diva to drag a bit, particularly when it focuses on the political intrigue. That's the wrong approach to take to this film.Instead, what you should do is sit back, enjoy the music, the visuals, and the characters, and let the film happen. Do that, and Diva is captivating.I was fortunate enough to find a copy on laserdisc last year, just before most of the places that carry laserdiscs started phasing them out..."
3,A great film gets a so-so transfer,"This beautiful, exciting movie gets only a so-so transfer to DVD. It's far better looking than any VHS presentation I've seen but still--the audio is mono, the print is sometimes scratchy, pixelation is evident in darker scenes and not ONE stitch of supplementary material (not even a listing of chapter stops!) makes this a relative disappointment."
5,DIVA is Devine,I loved this film. DIVA has the most amazing chase scene that I have ever seen - on a motorcycle in the Paris Metro.
1,Don't waste your money!,Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD. It's a travesty of the DVD medium. Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously: they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy. Don't waste your money on it.
1,Dreadful,"I recall this movie fondly--Unfortunately, the DVD quality is so poor, this cannot be watched. Pity Amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings. Don't waste your time until someone cleans this up. But it makes a nice coaster, though."
4,Fox Lorber DVD,I purchased one and it sounded pretty bad which was sort of strange in view of the Cesar Award it won for sound. Then it occurred to me that it was also a pretty old DVD. It was stamped at a time when nobody was sure about TV sets.In this case how many channels for sound were available: one or two? You must go to the menu and adjust the audio. Otherwise it sends all the sound down one channel and it simply sounds horrible. After I made the adjustment for two channels and played it again there was a substantial improvement in the audio of the DVD.
1,Wish I'd listened to the warnings,"Horrid sound that gets worse as the movie progresses. I'd read the customer comments and bought it anyway. The sound is so bad at the end of the film that I had to turn the volume up to 9/10ths to hear anything at all. Instead of enjoying the film I was constantly reaching for the volume control. By far this is the worst transfer of a film to DVD that I've seen/heard. If you're thinking of buying, think again or go get a video copy."
4,Unusual but pleasing,"The Bottom Line:A flashy and fun thriller with a rightly-famous chase scene through the Paris Metro that heralded (for better or for worse) the advent of the Cinema Du Look mini-movement in France that went away from realism and steered Gallic cinema towards the slickness of directors like Luc Besson, Diva is winding and twisting in a good way, always interesting to look at and follow; though some of the supporting characters remain ambiguous because they're reoccurring characters in the novel the book is based on, there are few other flaws in this unique film.3.5/4"
3,I LOVE THIS FILM!!!,"This was the first foreign film I'd ever seen (back in the early 80s)and I've never forgotten it; it's a complete masterpiece. It opened my eyes to foreign cinema and can't get enough of films from other countries. I gave this product review 3 stars because I love the film, but hearing from others that the sound transfer is horrible, I was completely destroyed! I really wanted to buy this, but now that I know about the sound and picture quality, I'll wait for something better. The films sound is SO important to the overall experience! How could the DVDs distributor not know this?! Talk about ""out to make a buck"" and not worry about quality! Sounds like a job for DTS to take over!"
5,stop your eyes watering!,"In 1981 Beineix made a great debut as a director: Diva was an instant cult. Twenty years after Diva is still a fine movie. The plot is always absorbing while tells the eccentric adventures of an opera- lover postman.The DVD release presents a good video track - fine work with the many dark scenes, too - and a clear audio track.Buy this DVD: you'll love the movie and - for sure - onions will stop making your eyes water!"
1,"Great film, but the worst quality DVD I have seen","An excellent French thriller, just starting to show its age - I love the film. However, the transfer to DVD is appalling. I saw the film on public service TV in France recently and the quality of that was vastly superior. The DVD quality reminded me of some pirate videos I have seen taken by a handheld in a cinema ... that bad."
4,Great film ... bad DVD transfer,"Shame on whoever rushed DIVA's transfer to DVD. It's a truly phenomenal film; it deserved a thorough remastering before being forced to make this leap into the digital domain. Even with its sometimes jerky pixilation and somewhat muffled monophonic sound, it's still worth buying."
1,Did It Backwards-Ordered Diva-Read Reviews-Canceled order,"Will someone PLEASE produce a DVD/VHS re-make of DIVA with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film!? I was so excited to finally find this movie, but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans, that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it. I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon."
4,DIVA - the DVD,"This French thriller/drama has stood the test of time. I originally saw it in French with subtitles, but the English voice-overs work pretty well. The ""darkness"" of the storyline is beautifully offset by the naivete of the main character, and the offbeat friends he has. It is beautifully filmed... really masterfully, with many scenes being worthy of still-frame masterpieces on their own. The soundtrack recording of opera singer Wilhelmina Wiggens-Fernandez is, as far as I can ascertain, the only recording this real-life diva has ever made. It is worth seeing the film just for her voice alone!"
2,"Great Movie -- Bad, Bad DVD","One of the main characters in this wonderful, quirky film is music. Full, amazing glorious sound weaves in and out of both plot and subplot. Well, it does in the movie, anyway. The truely awful mono sound on this DVD is like blacking out the image of one of the stars.It's still a good story but if you've seen/heard this movie in a decent theater the terrible sound on this DVD will have you screaming in frustraition. Where's a Criterion Edition when we need it?"
4,"Beats FoxLorber, but only a so-so print. Why?","Much better sound than the (awful) Fox Lorber version, much better DVD recording quality, and widescreen, too. HOWEVER, the Fox Lorber guys started with a much better print (they just messed it up); this version (Anchor Bay) used a grainy and somewhat faded print. A shame for a movie that relies so much on the visuals. When, oh when can we have a competent DVD recording struck from a high-quality print?Five stars for the movie per se, three for the technical execution of this DVD."
1,Please do it over!,"I've seen 'Diva' on public TV and on VHS. The story is wonderful, lyrical and exciting. The DVD version is terrible simply because the sound was so poorly transferred. Please do it over, with the speakers turned on. Then, it will deserve at least 4 stars!"
1,"Terrific movie, ruined by horrible sound",I was trying to replace my copy of Diva taped off the television with the DVD. That copy was infinitely better than the DVD. The sound was like an AM radio stuck under a pillow. Pretty ironic for a movie about some quality sound recording equipment. It is definitely not worth the money. Do not buy!
2,Bah,"This is a pretentious damn film, with an utterly absurd plot which they attempt to disguise with all sorts of slow-paced artiness."
4,Very Diverse French Cult movie,"This movie was recommended to my by the NY Times 1000 best movies of all time and it's certainly not bad.The story is a little complicated to tell since there are two plots that are intertwined, leading to misunderstandings that are sometimes funny, sometimes a little shameful.Acting is of course superb and very laidback, except for the Diva herself, who is American.The two henchmen of the mob however are portrayed dumb and have some characteristics that could also belong the Three Stooges. One of them hates everything and will always say so. This to me brings the movie down a bit.The music is diverse too. Some of the classical and of course the opera stuff is really good. Unfortunately it was made in 1982 so it also included really bad synthesizer music that never really stood to the test of time.See it nonetheless, it's a great classic."
1,I'm one of the few who didn't like the film.,"Sorry, but I agree with the fellow who says that this filmis overrated. To those who love it, ""I'm happy for you."" I saw it on TV - beautiful music, lush photography, but by the end of the film, I felt that I was wasting my time -- at the end, it reminded me of an ordinary TV thriller climax. Sorry - once was enough for me."
2,"Award for worst sound, ever!","I have to agree with Mr. Hodges; the film is very cool and a lot of fun. I have shown it over the years in my French classes. But, the sound is extremely inadequate. I had to turn my tv monitor all the way up, and we could still barely make out the conversation and sound effects. Until they clean up or restore the sound, don't waste that valuable money!"
4,"Stylish, charming, and always original,","A wonderful combination of many genres - Action / Drama / Mystery / Romance / Thriller / Music/Art, this tale of two tapes may actually change the way you think about opera.Wilhelmenia Fernandez as Cynthia Hawkins (Diva) who always refused to be recorded - is a revelation; her voice, a magic mixture of melted pure gold and crystal is a miracle.There are so much more in this absolutely unique film - just to mention a certain shoplifting technique, or the coolest chase which started in the streets of Paris and ended in the subway's car.The most fascinating thing for me is that Diva was released about twenty years ago in Moscow, I remember the title - but I never saw it back then. Better later than never.Highly recommended - 4.5/5"
5,We Still Love It!,"Back when I was teaching French in high school, I used the French version. For some,it was the first encounter with opera; they loved it all, the music, the mystery, the chase scenes. My husband and I decided to make a collection of films we want to see again and again, and ""Diva"" was #1 on the list."
4,At the Top,"Diva is one of my all-time favorite movies. I have been looking to replace my very old and very worn VHS version with a DVD, but alas, it seems that the quality is not up to par for this excellent film. I still remember the first time that I saw it. I was transformed. I have seen it probably about 25 times and it never loses its impact, its freshness, its greatness.I hope that another version is released soon. I plan on having some type of version for the rest of my life."
1,Horror,"This DVD is an insult to DVD technology. I have never heard such a bad sound, not even on video tapes. The movies worth is at least 50% sound (who ever saw it). Besides the fact that laguage is french (what I oversaw) this es my worst DVD experience ever. 1 star is too much."
3,Recommend for NT / 2000 users,"I agree with the ""A Disappointment"" review. Their chess game is not even in the same order magnitude as ChessMaster 8000. Their other games will also fail in comparison with their full-blown 95 / 98 / ME counterparts. But ChessMaster 8000 wouldn't run on my Windows 2000 computer and neither will many of those counterparts. 95 / 98 / ME users have an abundance of game software. This is not true for NT / Windows 2000 users. I am going Classic Board Games three stars and recommend it for NT / Windows 2000 users for two reasons: it will run, and a full Classic Board Games install does not require a CD to initiate it. This is convenient for gamers who simply want to play off their hard disk. If you are a 95 / 98 / ME user, skip Classic Board Games, and buy those counterparts."
1,useless,This software can't process the info you enter from your w2 correctly. When it comes to capital gains and losses you may as well read the IRS instructions.
1,I'm afraid I will have to put TaxCut down,"I am afraid that this will be the last year I will use TaxCut after using it for at least the past six years. The program added over $6000 of extra 1099-misc income into my return. It was just there out of the blue. No entry, no name from whom it came from just an extra $6,000 of income out of thin air. Not a good thing. Luckily, I caught it."
4,Thumbs Up!,"I'm a big fan of Steve O from Thumb Wars, Kung Pow, and the Blair Thumb. Of the thumb trilogy, I'd put Thumbtanic at #2 behind Thumb Wars. This is a good flick and well worth the purchase if you're a fan of wacky humor and talking thumbs with goofy facial expressions. The music video spoof had me rolling. I also own the original Titanic, which helps in getting all the parody elements. Definitely recommend this."
3,Spend your money on a better flick!,Thumbtanic is one of about 5 film shorts with thumb actors. Out of the 2 that I have seen this is the one lacking in humor. I highly recommend you buy Thumb Wars instead. I got MANY more laughs out of it than I did Thumbtanic.
5,I never saw the 3 hour long 'Titanic'...,"and if God is willing, I never WILL. But I did see 'Thumbtanic', a lovely picture of an event that never happened, about a ship, a giant piece of ice and a big spider. The hero, Jake, and his true love, Geranium, fall in love, do the nasty, learn to spit and escape the ship all in about 27 minutes. The rich thumbs make fun of the poor thumbs, the Captain is ALWAYS wearing a life-jacket and there are LOTS of funny accents. What MORE can you ask for?If you liked this movie you will LOVE 'Thumb Wars'."
3,i don't know about this one,"let's just say of all the thumb movies we have, this one so far has been the least watched. But you'll find that out for yourself. Not sure why all the 5 stars for this review. Compared to the other thumbs this one was just ok, not great as one would expect."
4,The Kobayashi Report,These two movies are really nice. Though I only have the first one at the moment.
1,Never received my items although I was charged for them,I haven't received my items nor have I gotten any response from the emails that I have sent inquiring about my order.
4,Crib set,"This crib set is as described, but I would have expected the bumpers to be slightly more plush for the money. Shipping was fast."
5,Never let your dream die...,"What can a person say... Rudy has shown me what it means to never quit, to never give up. After reading the book (and watching the movie) you realize that no matter what others say, no matter what the obstacles, no matter what the odds, the only thing that keeps you away from your dream is what's in your heart."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I had been looking for Millstone's Vermont Maple Coffee for months, only to find out that it had been discontinued. I was hoping to find a replacement, but this coffee tastes nothing like it. I guess it is just not a popular flavor, but it was my favorite weekend coffee."
2,"Annotations very good, but it's still Austen","The annotations in this volume make it worth buying if you must read Austen; they give P & P more depth and interest. On the other hand, it is still Austen (though probably her best). Given that the Bronte sisters wrote only a few decades later, and managed to have characters with depth and stories with plot turns, Austen appears really overrated to me. So I give the book 2 stars for the annotations, but keep it low so Amazon will quit recommending Austen books for me, and save them for those who do appreciate her."
5,The Annotated Pride and Prejudice,"Absolutely superior! It allows the reader to fully understand the snallest details of the novel that would otherwise be missed due to changes in the meaning of many words as well as the mannerisms and social structure of that time. If you have read Pride and Prejudice before and enjoyed it, you are in for a special treat. You will be amazed at how much more you will get from it by reading the annotations along with the novel. The layout is exceptional because the annotations are on the page opposite the corresponding page of the novel--no referring to the back of the book. The annotations flow with the novel. It is an exceptional work which I very highly recommend. A++++++++++"
5,a tour de force,"The author's command of the life and times of Jane Austen is indeed noteworthy. Many annotated versions of literary works are content to clarify obscure or archaic vocabulary. This book not only explains word usage; it offers brief but remarkably detailed commentary on the society, manners, transportation, architecture, commerce, entertainment, politics, values, religion, and every other conceivable aspect of the background which Austen took for granted and without which the novel cannot be fully appreciated. Dr. Shapard's Introduction to the volume does a thorough and succinct job of placing the novel in the context of Jane Austen's own life and relating it to her other works. Both students and Austen aficionados should be very grateful for this first ever annotated version of Pride and Prejudice."
5,Great book!,"I really enjoy reading the ""Classics"" but sometimes the language is hard to decipher. The annotated version is just great! I understand what the characters are talking about and I can imagine life back in those times. I bought the book for leisure reading, but I'm sure this would be helpful for a student."
4,Transformative!,"Mr. Shapard does a fair amount of gushing, but he gets it out of his system after about a hundred pages. What's left is historical context, balanced literary interpretation and elucidation of the subject matter. Overall, he's done a wonderful job.Years ago, I read P&P; and thought it was alright but nothing worth getting excited about. When I read this version, suddenly it wasn't just two people talking; it was Darcy digging himself a hole in front of the oblivious Elizabeth. Talk about something worth getting excited about; I couldn't put it down."
5,Must Have for P&P Fans,"After you've read Pride and Prejudice over and over, it is time to read this version. The annotated version provides key insights to life during the early 1800s as well as interpretation of antiquated phrases and references. I found it an excellent companion and gave me a new view of P&P with more assurance of the nuanaces that I might have missed before. I heartedly recommend it."
4,Essential,"Face it, you are not typical landed genteel aristocracy of the period. Jane Austin assumed her readers would understand her references. Books like this level the playing field (they also make for a slow if rewarding reread). Imagine Miss Austin trying to follow your tweets..."
2,Terrible Kindle rendition of a wonderful book,"I have read Pride and Prejudice at least six times in print, including the print edition of this book. For my most recent re-read, I started with the free Kindle edition, but was put off by the many typos, so I thought that I would just buy the Kindle edition of The Annotated Pride and Prejudice. Unfortunately, this book ALSO had many off-putting typos. I guess that for books that were originally published in the pre-ebook era the process of conversion to Kindle involves scanning with an OCR reader, which would be fine if someone actually went back and proofed the result. That obviously did not happen here. Since I'm re-reading the entire opus this summer (done with Emma and P&P, on to Northanger Abbey), I'd be very interested if anyone could point me at a high-quality set of Jane Austen books that I could read on Kindle. I haven't found any, yet."
5,Self-title,"Killer, just killer, i bought into the abyss before this, loved it, got this after, loved it even more, buy it."
4,No one can match Hypocrisy,"This is agreat album. It's perfect both in music and lyrics. Great production and sound. The songs are amazing and Hypocrisy shows why they are the best nowadays. So,you are maybe wondering why only 4 stars? This album offers different variations of styles and it's really heavy and these dudes display their musical skills and talent(with mastermind Peter Tagtgren), but there are too many slow and melancholic songs and less heavy-blazing fast songs(only two; ""Apocaliptic Hybrid"" and ""Time Warp""). As I said before, the production is great. But this ""Hypocrisy"" sounds too refined and polished which, to me, rests strength. ""Abducted"" and ""The Final Chapter"" sound heavier. Despite this, Hypocrisy is Hypocrisy and won't let you down. Anyway, I love Hypocrisy and all of their albums. This album is great and is a must-have, for Hypocrisy fans and death metal fans."
5,"Great Tracks, Mixed Album","Another great Album from Peter Tagtrem & Hypocrisy!The band aren't afraid of experimenting and this recordis much more melodic & synth / keyboard driven then earlier work.The opening track Fractured Millenium is one of the best songs I own.Just perfect. Guitar solo kicks into a belting ending and you'll probably repeat it 10 time before listening to the whole record! Fusion Programmed Minds is also very good.I don't like the rest of the Album! but these 2 are more than enough for 5 stars alone. That Good! After this the album is more of a melo rock album. Quite slow & easier to listen to then Death Metal. Almost 'Emo'Credit to Tagtrem they are all good songs. And this would please a Metal Fan who doesn't only like really heavy bands. But not quite my thing.But they are growing on me. The Fourth Dimension is a very solid death metal album. And there latest Virus, is also good If you like heavier stuff."
4,Stunning album by one of the greats,"This album was my introduction to the vast world of Hypocrisy. After listening to it, I didn't quite know what to make of it. At the time, my favorite bands were At the Gates, In Flames, and Amorphis. I was told that I would like these guys since I like death metal, and boy were they right. Hypocrisy is brutal, yet melodic, angry yet soothing, fast yet strangely slow. This album kept me guessing the whole way. A total unpredictable album, which makes it fun, yet scary to listen, because you never know where Hypocrisy will take you next. One song might be like thrash, yet the next might be atmospheric, and the next comes with the screeching vocals whereas the next song brings the growling vocals.I kid you not: Hypocrisy is one of the best death metal bands around. My only regret is that I didn't discover them sooner."
3,Sappy!,"I live near the DeLand area, and our local paper really hyped up this movie so thought I'd order it for my 2 yr. old granddaughter who loves the circus. This didn't hold her attention at all. There's no more circus footage in it than there is flashes of local signs and businesses and Stetson Univ. The story is insimpid and simplistic; at least there's nothing objectionable in it, but the little boy is a tossed-around foster child whose father was killed in a motorcycle accident. I hope the proceeds of this movie went to help either foster kids or the circus animals and not to help any of the old fogeys that starred in it finance their golden years."
3,The First of May,Another good family film. One finds it hard to get good moral family films that touch the heart and teaches at the same time giving the family a time to talk about the film and how it applies to our life! Thanks
4,home town,"the reason I bought this is because it was made in our city of DeLand, Fla. and our nexy door city, Lake Helen. I bought 3 and have loaned them out to friends.this is a fun movie for Grammas and young children. however teens aren't interested."
4,"Irreverent, but also gripping","I'm not a mom, nor do I live in San Francisco, but I found myself not only relating to these characters, but wanting to find out how all of their stories came out.I think we can all relate to reaching that point in your life where you wonder, ""How did I get here?"" And this book explores what happens to four very different women who have reached that point.Plus, I think it reveals a side of San Francisco that few of us even know exists. There are many books that do a similar thing for New York and its high society. Not so many for San Francisco."
1,waste of paper,"This was selected for our reading group...we saw no merrit in itat all. vacuous shallow characters, no plot, no development, gramatical errors throughout. Aparently there is another book with the same title by a different author which is worth the paper it is written on. I cannot imagine how M Elizabeth Clark got this published... maybe she was friends with the publisher... not any more I think: I can only imagine Sales must have bombed."
4,The Mother's Group,"I thought this book was quite entertaining and well written. It is especially good if you happen to have kids and live in San Francisco, but even if you don't but you have been part of a club at some point in your life, the book will probably resonate. I think this is the first book that Elizabeth has written and thought it a terrific first attempt. I hope she will take writing up as a career."
4,A Fun Read,"This is a droll yet ultimately generous examination of the meandering path to fulfillment charted by many mothers who leave the workplace to raise their children. Unlike many recent articles and books to address this subject, this book neither castigates nor exalts the career-woman-turned-stay-at-home-mom. It simply presents her honestly, with all her insecurities, vanities, hopes, and earnest fumbling toward balance intact. As a lawyer who chose to stay home six years ago, I saw myself in many of these characters, and enjoyed many a good laugh at my own expense as I flew through the pages. Well done."
1,"Characters with no depth, poorly written, no excuse for grammatical errors","I really wanted to like this book. The cover looked fun and as I flipped through the pages at the bookstore decided to plop it into my basket.I was completely disappointed in the writing. Between improper use of punctuation, poor grammar (did anyone bother to edit this book?), shallow characters, useless name-dropping of San Francisco landmarks and no plot there was little left to enjoy. I forced myself to finish the book hoping there would be some redeeming qualities but none ever presented.I'm sorry I spent the money on the book. If you really must read this book, at least get the paperback version or buy it used. Personally, I couldn't even give this book out to friends as I didn't want them to waste their time."
3,The Catholic Study Bible: New American Bible,I started reading from the beginning of the bible and noticed that revisions made in the updated versions have left out details of Scripture in lue of simplicity. How can you revise the Word of God? I don't believe you can. I want to return this version of the Bible do to this reason.
4,Good Catholic Study Bible,"Originally I purchased this for my son who is going to Iraq. I was going to give it to him for Christmas. However, I noted the print was so small and he had asked for something bigger than what the Army issued prints are, so I ended up ordering him something different - not a study Bible. With all of the good study material included on each page, it is necessary for the print to be the smaller size - so it's a good Bible if you want a study Bible with all of the extra information in it - the references and maps, etc. However, for a praying, casual reading, type of Bible this may not be the one that you want."
4,Bible,This Bible is a good resource when studying the Bible.There is interpretations of passages that allows you tobetter understand it.
5,Great bible,Great condition. No scratches or sticker marks or bent pages. Lots of great study hints and explantions in the book...hence the name 'study bible'
4,More than I expected,This Bible contains a wealth of information both within the Bible text and in the articles providing historical background to the text. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to have a better understanding of scripture and consider it essential reading for anyone who reads the Bible literally.
1,Missing Exodus and part of Genesis,"Ordered it while in Iraq, and had it shipped to my home. Return a couple of months ago--eager to begin using it--and found it missing all of Exodus and part of Genesis. According to Amazon, it's too late to return it. Waste of money :-("
5,The Catholic Study Bible,This study Bible is amazing. The commentary is found on the same page as the original text making it very easy to cross over to the study portion. Our entire family really loves the indented black tabs that are incorporated in this sacred book as well as it being well-bounded leather literary treasure. The print is clear and very readable.
4,Good Resource for Catholic Bible Study,"For any of us to pick up the Bible and think that we will understand it on our own is both folly and arrogance. The Bible was written in languages (Hebrew and Greek) foreign to most of us, in a location thousands of miles from us folks in the U.S., and thousands of years ago. The Catholic Study Bible provides readers with reliable assistance in unpacking the meaning of God's Word and provides Catholics with outstanding Bible scholarship by Catholic scholars who, like Fr. Donald Senior, are among the best in the world. This is an excellent resource for Catholics who are learning about the Bible on their own or are involved in Bible Study.Joe Paprocki ""Catechist's Journey""God's Library: A Catholic Introduction to the World's Greatest BookThe Catechist's Toolbox: How to Thrive As a Religion Education TeacherLiving The Mass: How One Hour A Week Can Change Your Life"
4,from a Protestant,"This book was purchased as a gift for a Catholic friend of the old school who was discouraged from reading the scriptures,and is forever asking me questions about the Bible but is often appalled by what I tell her is written in the scriptures. I hope she will read and believe this ""Catholic"" version of the Bible and be able to accept the truth of God's word for herself. For me, I was very impressed by the introduction and in reading excerpts from the various books of the Bible, found no difference in this version and the versions I read as a Protestant, so I sent it to her that she may know our Lord and His Christ for herself."
3,OK,"Substance is good. Paper quality is not so good. Very unhappy that the text of Jesus' Words is not differentiated by use of another color, e.g., red."
3,The rating is for the study guide part of it,"As another reviewer said, the Bible itself needs no rating. However, I am disappointed with the study guide as it seems to reduce study of the Bible to a dry history lesson. This is a living book and I was expecting to see more down to earth, practical application of God's word in today's world. The lack of a doctrinal index IS a serious omission, in my opinion. Still, I think it's a nice book to have because it gives the historical context of each of the Bible books. In some places, it also mentions archaeological support for the existence of people and places. Although I gave the book a rating of 3 stars, I think it's worth having and can enhance the spiritual growth of serious Catholics"
3,retraction,"I would like to retract the last 2 star review that I gave, it is somewhat excessive. I stand by my comments from the first review that I gave, and I would suggest that those interested in the Catholic Study Bible also consider purchasing the St. Joseph's Edition of the New American Bible instead. The Doctrinal Index and Dictionary are very helpful, while the information in the reading guides of the New American Bible can be obtained in an inexpensive introduction to the bible. The Catholic Study Bible is a fairly good edition of the Bible, unfortunately it lacks the excellent Doctrinal Index of the St. Joseph's Edition. Also, in some of the reading guides, there is perhaps, I slight tendency to overemphasis the distinction between the Bible as lived in the Church today and the bible in the history of the Tradition."
5,Read the whole thing on a plane,"My mom gave me this ""book"" to read on a plane ride to Bucharest. I've always read the Bible on a regular basis but this time I also liked the essays and commentaries in the front part of the Catholic Study Bible and we are not even catholic. On our plane ride I would read one Book of the Bible at a time and then go back and read the commentary: I did it this way for the whole Bible, though some Books (Ezra-Nehemiah) I could do a few at a time. Thanks Mom for buying me this!"
5,oooooooooohhhhhhhhh aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh,I finally have a Legolas toy and seriously this is awsome he is my favorite one out of everybody one problem though one hand is so wide I can't even put his bow in he comes with a rohan long knife two elven knives and a bow and 5 arrows cape is removablebut heck about the hand I just adjusted it a bit and then it was perfect this toy is worth every penny
5,Sun Damage,"We bought our pool last year, and it barely made it through the summer. The only problem, aside from the pump being too small to adequately clean the pool, was the fact that the sun deteriorated the ring around the top. By the end of the summer the pool was ruined. It was impossible to protect the vinyl because using the cover made the water too warm.There are much better pools available for the money . My friend bought one with the PVC ring, and still has it four years later. I think that I will be purchasing one this year."
4,New ladder design is Dangerous-no top platform!,"We have purchased two of these pools. This year we purchased the 18 X 48 as the 18 X 54 was not available anymore in this easy set design. The ladder that came with the pool is very dangerous! There is no top platform, only two rungs on each side and you can see the top blow up ring and a child can step on it and slip down between the ladder and pool. Warning!"
1,Air Ring Problems!!!!,"After one season of use the vinyl air ring developed numerous pinhole-size leaks that could not be repaired. As soon as I fixed one hole another one was created somewhere else as the vinyl slowly deteriorated in the sun. The customer ""service"" section at InTex was not at all helpful. All they could offer was to sell me more ineffective patches. They had no other solution and actually stated that the deteriorating vinyl was MY fault because I used their pool in Texas. I strongly advise against buying one of these pools if you intend to use it anywhere the sun shines."
4,Good luck finding the B filter needed for the 18' pool,"Beware: If you purchase this pool, you will have a very, very hard time finding the filter necessary for the 18' version. Lots and lots of A filters; almost never B filters.What good is selling the item if you cannot find the filter which does need changing every two weeks. Otherwise, the pool is easy to set up and provides a lot of fun. Plus, save the outrageous shipping charge and go get it at your local WalMart or ToysRUs."
1,leaks,"purchased pool in 08/05, after season stored unit in clean plastic & placed in heated basement of my home. unit devoleped leaks afted 2 weeks of use in spring of 06. please do not purchase pool store or company will not stand behind product"
1,Terrible durability and inadequate pump,"Like others here I bought the Easy Set pool from Intex because of limited space and dollars, and I thought if I got 3 or 4 years out of it that I would be satisfied. Setup was easy as could be, I didn't level the ground but I should have. Still I could fill it up to the top ring and it wasn't off more that a couple of inches. Bought all required chemicals, test strips, etc., balanced the water and shocked it every week, ran the pump at least 4 hours a day, cleaned the filter once per week.Pool water still turned green from algae, so contrary to directions I bought a vaccum attachment and hose and used the pump to vaccum. Found out filter would not catch the algae, so I would vaccum water out in the yard wasting 25 to 40% of the pool water each time. Then after 1 month the top ring starting a slow leak, then after 2 months the seams started splitting and leaking near the bottom of the pool.This pool was a complete waste of time and money."
2,I don't like it.,This pool was nothing but trouble for me and my family.We had the ground professionally leveled and then it still wouldn't stand up right. It would get about half full and then it would fall right down to the ground.This isn't a good product to me.I took it back and got my refund. Make sure you keep your receipt if you buy this product.We took all the right precautions but it still didn't work right. I don't really know what was wrong with it...but I Know that it wasn't our fault that it kept falling down to the ground.And the pump to the pool was horrible as well...It wouldn't even filter the water correctly..The water was nasty because the pump was not doing it's job. Think about it before you buy this pool.
1,not easy at all...,"I bought this pool because it was the largest inflated above ground pool and SUPPOSIVELY, it was easy to setup. That was wrong! For starters, it advertises as ""no tools needed."" Wrong! I was upset to find that it did not include an air pump to inflate the pool ring, so count on spending more money for that if you do not have one (and a bicycle pump will take you forever...so plan on purchasing a more commercial air compressor). Also, a screw driver is absolutely necessary to tighten the brackets for the hoses. Another thing wrong is that it advertises that this pool can be setup in 30 minutes....wrong! Plan on a full day....and that's if you are lucky and have lots of help...I am personally still having problems setting mine up due to the pool ring leaking and the hose gaskets leaking water. I am disappointed in this pool...would not have purchased it if I known the difficulty,etc. For a little more, get a professional above ground installed."
1,What about holes???,"I'm surprised that no one else has had a problem with holes! It's a little hard to locate a hole in the top of a swimming pool. If you try to put it under water, all of the water comes out. You could walk around with a spray bottle, but that's like finding a needle in a haystack! I spent $100.00 on one of these pools and had to throw it away at the end of the summer. Also, no one has mentioned anything about rain. Several times our pool would fill up so high that ALL of the water would overflow onto the ground. This wouldn't happen with a metal pool. It seems like these ""Easy Pool Sets"" are taking over all of the stores, and it's almost impossible to find a metal pool, unless you want to spend $1,000.00 or more!"
5,Be Careful In Your Pool ! Wave Girl,"Since my friends are coming over for a pool party I tell them to hold your breath before going in,because you go under water.The friends that I'm inviting knows how to swim.My friend Julieth is bringing her sister to my party so I'm kind of scared that she might drown but Julieth will keep an eye out for her sister thats why I'm not that worried.I have advice for you to watch little kids in big pools."
4,Our town requires this pool to have a fence,great pool and lots of fun. Can't use it now because our town requires a fence for this pool because it is over 24 inches of water and the side make it easy for a child to climb into. You might want to check your town codes before buying and setting up. Towns are getting much stricter on these pools now that more and more of them are being put up.
2,"great fun, but only lasted one season","We purchased this pool last summer and had a wonderful time all season. We packed the pool away in our heated storage room for the winter and just brought it out again yesterday. First, there was a rather large hole in the inflatable ring. It looked like it was due to sun damage. Still, no big deal. We patched it with the repair kit and filled the pool. This morning, we woke up to discover that one of the seams had come apart and we had a steady stream of water coming out the side of the pool. When we called Intex to ask about possible repairs, we were told that the seams are not patchable and that we're basically out of luck.I would never have spent $400 on the pool if I had known it would only last one summer. Instead, I would have purchased a sturdier (and more expensive) soft sided pool that had a better warranty. Of course, Intex ""kindly"" pointed out that we can purchase a new liner for a mere $299. I think not."
1,Don't get taken by the great hype and reviews...,"This company has a list of complaints on the BBB. This pool has cost me hundreds of dollars in water bills, and headaches due to leaks and cheap motors that consume tons of electricity. This year, I had it up 1 week, and already lost 2000 gals of water due to defective plunger vales. The list goes on. Beware... Disregard the hype. Review the BBB instead."
2,This pool is a never ending investment!!,"I have 3 children 7,4,&1 and bought this pool to teach the kids how to swim & it's enjoyable for adults too. You have to watch the little ones because they can climb on anything and fall in very easily!!!! Setting up this pool is horrible. You need to set it up perfectly or it will slant causing water to gush out over the side!! We've used the pool with no problems for about 3 weeks and then the water turned green. The filter is awful. We have used a ton of chemicals, ran the filter all day, vacuume constantly and eventually we had to drain about 3,000 gallons of water and fill it up again. One time my 4 yr old leaned on the side and the whole side collapsed and he fell out along with 2,000 gallons of water. The parts wear easily & need to be replaced too! It's a hassle & a money sucker!!"
1,Leaky product,"This is our second run through with this product. After buying and filling the pool twice, both times it had leaks."
1,"It is not an ""easy pool"" set","I bought this pool due to it's size and advertised ease of setup. In contrast, it is anything but easy to setup. The instructions are vague and minimal. Also, it is implied that everything you need is in this set.....but be warned that I was shocked to find that an air pump was not included. Thus original installation of the pool was delayed (we could inflate the ring), until I ran to a nearby store and spent 40 additional dollars on one). It is suggested on the box that this pool can be setup in 30 minutes....it has taken us days to install it and the pool is still leaking around the filter pump. It does not suggest long-term outdoor exposure, so winterizing it for storage will not be easy. I fear that the filter pump is fragile and does not do well when exposed to outdoor climates. If I had known this pool was so difficult, I would have avoided it."
5,Awesome value,"I upgraded from the 12x36 to the 18X48 that was on the corner of our patio this year and had to move it to the center of thethe lawn. I spent a day leveling the ground by removing all the grass and using a yard of sand to build up the low end. After that was complete we rolled out the tarp, pool and connected the pump. A day later we were having fun and it was up for the better part of 4 months. Keep the 3 inch chlorine tablets in the floaty and keep it covered at night and run the pump for 5-8 hours a day and have fun!!! At the end of the summer, empty it, wipe it and put in the shed!!! This will be the fifth year with one and it has been an awesome value for the amount of enjoyment it has brought our family!"
2,Easy Set Pool - A Pain To Clean,"I thought this pool was a great alternative to putting in a big pool. However, we can't find filters anywhere for this bigger size pool. (...) I had to order them from another online company and still don't have them. The vacuum system is a joke. It does pick up little solid debris from the floor, but it does nothing for pollens, algaes, and those sorts of things. The filter bag just pushes those things right back through. I went to the pool store to buy a real vacuum only to find that you can't hook one up with this kind of filter. I like the idea of the pool and it was exceedingly easy to set up, however I'm not sure if we'll be able to continue using it if we can't buy filters or get it clean."
4,arrogant reviewers,"I happen to of had the luck of seeing the entire dragon ball series, and while these three episodes may be lacking in some of the characteristic fighting as seen in most of them (they are running and hidding most of the time), if you are trying to get the entire majin buu saga, then it's worth it. Alot happens in the these episodes which are very important to the story as a whole.now that i'm done with the review, i feel i need to vent about a pet peeve. One thing i can't stand is when arrogant children write reviews on something which they have a natural hatred be it lack of inteligence, or maturity, and then feel the need to share these in a public forum, so please primedmaiden, stop reviewing till you have some real insight"
1,the fusion of gotenks,mr.boo[fatboo] split into parts and it in too two types one is completely evil and one completly good then the bad boo beats up the good one the good one looks just like mr boo and then the evilbuu abzorbs the good one and becomes superboo.
5,Good Prose Rendering,"Mascaro's translation, while widely acknowledged as not the most accurate, is a very good introduction to the Gita. The style is prose throughout, which brings out none of the Gita's beauty, but as for as understanding goes, there few deficiencies here. This should probably not be one's sole resource in studying the book, but fortunately, ther is no commentary so that the reader is left to make up his or her own mind about the value of the book. Nearly all the Sanskrit words have been translated, so that the feeling or reading something ""foreign"", common to students of the Gita, is noticeably absent. The introductory essay is helpful, but not essential to the understanding of the Song. All in all, a good attempt, but for a better rendering, try Ramanand Prasad's translation, as it is a bit more modern and moves easier than this one."
1,NOT Laurie Patton's translation,"While it says that this is Laurie Patton's translation on the main Amazon page, this is actually Juan Mascaro's translation, done back in the late 1960's. This should be corrected immediately."
1,gita,all i want to say is that if you want to interprete gita in its fullest then don't go for any translations.first study sanskrit and then read gita in its original form.that would be the right path for knowing the truth.
2,biblical gita,"full of mistranslations of key concepts..there is just so much of this that it forms an underlying structuralorientation of the translation, starting with the [long] introductionwith bible quotes to justify translation choices..the last words of krishna are changed to ""thy will be done""lifted straight from mathew, luke and the lords prayer..a translation by an academic bible scholar, shows its origins..and ruins the subtleties of this timeless discourse..carlnamaste"
3,Buyer Beware!!!!,"I have not read this book yet. But I want to save everyone the surprise I received when I opened the package. This book appears to be out of print. It seems that as a result Amazon does not show the book's list price. I had heard good things about this book and thinking that the used price ""must"" be less then the list price I ordered a used one at $75. I received a copy of the book directly from the author herself. Much to my surprise and dismay the list price on the inside cover was $22."
2,Cabbage is cabbage,"I like the old recipe better, but this should give some people who were intolerant to the limitations of the old recipe a choice. It is okay. Cheap book worth buying for what it is."
2,Save your money.,"Not much has changed from the original diet. You might be able to stay on it for a week and loose some water pounds, but you will not be able to survive on this one. Look for something else if you want to loose weight that will stay off."
3,intersting book...but,"I didn't get this book from amazon, but I did buy it from B&N. The book was interesting and reminded me of the funny cabbage diet my Nana tried when I was a kid...the only problem with my copy is that someone ripped out the pages that had the instructions not only for the old and new diet, but also for the instructions of making the soup. You gotta laugh at that one!! Not sure how well the diet would work if you A.) had the info and B.) Followed the info, but the rest of the book was pleasant to read through."
2,never received book,"I never received the book. I contacted them, got a quick response. They were unabale to find another copy so are refunding me my money. I want to give more stars in rating due to their quick response but seeing I didn't get my book - will stay with two."
5,Excellent book on Charge Pumps,"Great and unique book on charge pump circuit design. This book has done an excellent job is combining the basic aspects of charge pump circuits, backs it up with thorough mathematical derivations, discusses various charge pump circuit and different associated circuit technologies and finally gives a practical design example by taking the reader through a detailed step by step approach and then analyzing the results."
2,Charge Pump Disaster,"The book is incomplete with regard to design. Little, if any, AC and transient analysis is presented. Information on closed-loop regulation techniques and analysis is missing"
3,"The details are great, but there are quite a few typographical errors in the equations, and errors of notations in the figure.","The details are great, but there are quite a few typographical errors in the equations, and errors of notations in the figures.The authors and the publisher McGraw Hill could have done a better work.I think this is a useful book for practicing engineers.Beware of the little mistakes a little here and there."
2,very disappointed,This is not a good book about charge pump design. The spelling mistakes or typos are very misleading and even confusing. Some points and explanations are repeated too many times and the content covered in the whole book could be compressed in one chapter.
5,excellent raw CD,"A friend of mine got me into these guys. If you like the beattles or radiohead you will LOVE this CD. They are working on a Studio album soon. This was recorded in their apartment on a 4-track. Raw and Excellent! Standouts are Sunbathing, Above, Crush Oubliette, and 2 studio tracks, Disillusion and Queue, but all the songs are great."
3,Another Human Resource Book with no Business case,"I was disappointed by the lack of real world examples. Most of the examples were ""human resource groups"". Now, to be sure, there are many really fine checklists for managers included in this book. Although they are basic, most managers find them useful and thought provoking.Unfortunately, as with most books on virtual teams, the authors have not focused on the critical operations which use virtual teaming: marketing, sales, program/project management. This book also neglects to leave the reader with a future focus --like: what is the new work and how will the businesses have to 'virtually' restructure or lose the ""command and control"" model of management."
1,Note the dates on these reviews...,"I was about to buy this book when I noticed that ALL of these five star reviews were written within a week of each other, many on the same day. To me, this says one person submitted all these reviews to boost sales. Maybe I'm wrong, but buyer beware."
5,Fired! -- A Must Have Career Guide,"A lifesaving publication, enlightening and insightful. Not only does it provide a step-by-step guide toward realizing goals, it will assist in that all important process of defining those goals and refining the techniques needed to go from point A to point B, point B being that all important career opportunity. I studied the material, applied it to my personal situation and was able to get that interview and ultimately an offer ""I could not refuse."" The author's straightforward approach makes it all fall into place. Believe in yourself and apply the methodology laid out for you in this book."
4,The process worked,"I know that a job search is really like working at a job. But, it's lots harder than working at a real job.I really liked this book. It helped me polish my resume and helped a great deal in both getting the interview and conducting myself through the interview. Bottom line: I got a better job!"
1,The libretto is all fouled up,The words in the book don't match the music. The scenes are out of order and some arias are missing from the libretto.
5,GREAT MUSIC FOR KIDS AND FAMILIES!,"I am always searching for great children's music. This CD is proof that there are great artists out there who are not getting the exposure other children's artists are. Our family absolutely loves this CD. Kimmy Schwimmy's music is incredibly well written. We found out by checking out her website that Kimmy Schwimmy Volume One are all songs Kimmy wrote specifically for her new preschool music curriculum. (check out her site and learn so much more about her! [...]). If you and your child are looking for great songs that teach preschool subjects, songs that are great to listen to and sing along with, and songs that you'll want to hear over and over again, buy this CD. It is AMAZING!"
3,Puzzling,"Not having been familiar with Joni James, I found my interest peaked by great reviews of her CDs both here and on other sites. I wish I could say my response was like that of apparently everyone else, but I can't.The band arrangements for JONI SINGS SWEET are incredibly good - among the best I've ever heard, actually, for these songs - and that's really the only reason I gave this CD three stars. (BOSSA NOVA STYLE is not as pleasing acoustically - very echoey vocals and kind of demure arrangements.)But, Ms James' vocals are the big problem for me. I found her phrasing unremarkable and her tone mostly colorless and sometimes even flat. I really don't understand all the rave reviews, but I wish I did. I wanted to love this CD."
4,Cute,"I enjoyed most parts of the movie. Since I have never done instant messaging, those IMs threw me off. Not to mention I have never seen or heard of an overweight cheerleader; during the competition there were several that appeared. Other than that, the main cast were great, I give thumbs up to the main performers."
4,So bad it's good.,"If you are a fifteen year old girl at heart or just a big dork you will enjoy this movie. Marcy Rylan steals the show from Hayden Panettiere. You should see Marcy in the movie ""Armageddon for Andy."" That's a movie you will never forget."
2,Difficult to root for either cheerleading-squad,"Root for the obnoxious rich kids?Or root for the poor kids who are even more obnoxious?Spoiler below10987654321At the end of the movie, when the rich kids are performing a cheerleading routine on stage and the poor kids take the stage in the middle, it was rude.The poor kids won by cheating.12345678910Spoiler above"
4,bring it on all or nothing,"This movie was great! The whole cast did a marvelous job. My favorite parts was just when they did all the stunts, it was so cool!! you've gotta see this movie."
4,GREAT BUT NOT THE BEST,"I loveed this movie. I am 14 and I was a cheerleader until I didnt make it onto the High School squad. Anywayz, I loved the characters and how it used many similarities to the 2 Bring it Ons. I especially watched this movie because it was filmed at my High School. El Segundo High School was the set for Pacific Vista High School. Well Thanx"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Upon delivery I assumed this slow cooker was built for longevity......heavy durable looks. Oh and I was very happy with the large size, auto defrost function etc.. After about three months on the high setting it began to overheat, so I used the low .....perfect. Needless to say thereafter the cooker worked every now and then. I really wanted to like this slow cooker but it failed to perform. So glad that I didn't get rid of the old faithful ceramic cooker."
1,too small,"This does not hold 8-1/2 quarts. It's comparable to the seven quart slow cooker that I have. I'm really disappointed. I never return things, but I sent this back."
1,8.5 QTS? NOT!!!,"Got this last week, cooked a first batch of chili yesterday, and this thing is going back. Why?1. When you make a batch of soup, have a known amount for dinner and put the rest in standard containers to freeze, you find out the actual capacity of the slow cooker. This thing is between 6.5 and 7 quarts max.2. The crock is a loose fit in the base and has to be carefully centered or you get ""hot spots"" where the crock is too close to the base. On the ""hot spots"" you get boling and sticking.3. I don't know what this fad with brushed stainless steel is about, but my experience years ago in a commercial environment was reinforced by this cooker. Brushed stainless steel mars easily and is difficult to clean without marking. And this thing gets hot!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS - DANGEROUS,"This is my 5th Slow Cooker. If you're going to buy one, buy one by Hamilton- Beach, they are the best and safest. I needed a larger pot and Elite was only one I could find. I'm a small caterer and this product should be recalled.It boiled at both High and Low temps, and continued boilding 1/2 hour after it was unplugged. It's handles are useless. H-B, have ""open"" handles for ease in carrying.The lid is useless. It doesn't fit, they even say that in their manual- what a great thing to be proud of. All slow cooker lids should have firm suction fits and latches like H-B's Stay 'n Go Slow Cooker has.This is the first Amazon product, in years, that I dislike. Amazon is good, this product is bad."
5,It's great,"DON'T LISTEN TO NEGATIVES THEY HAVE BUYERS REMORSE ITS A GREAT POT..I have had this crock pot for almost 2 years and use it weekly sometimes daily. I have never burnt food or had a blotched meal from it i don't know where any negative comments are coming from other than maybe there cooking on high all day long. I just recently took first place in a chili contest which was all cooked in this pot. I cook roast,chicken ribs and much more. My family is big i have 6 people to feed and this thing will cook enough for left overs. DON'T LISTEN TO NEGATIVES THEY HAVE BUYERS REMORSE ITS A GREAT POT"
3,Not bad for the money,I love the large size and cost of the unit. The removable center fits almost anything I cook and is easy to clean. The negative aspects are that the aluminum outside unit is thin and dents easily. It also gets hot to the touch so I have been leery to leave it to cook when I am not in the house.
4,"the not so slow, slow cooker","As others have noted, this particular cooker isn't slow at all. We use it frequently and have simply learned to adjust the cooking times accordingly. It works great for us, and we've had many a great meal thanks to this product. It isn't really what you want if you have the need to put something on before work and leave it for 7 or more hours. It literally cooked a 3lb roast in less than 4 hours on the LOW setting. It also does get extremely hot, so have plenty of counter space to set it up on."
4,Big slow cooker,"I have only used this twice, but so far, I love it. I made meatballs and beef stew. I made a ton of food and didn't even come close to filling the thing up. My only concern is that when it was on high, the food was boiling pretty fast. I will probably mostly use it only on low."
5,Fast cooker,"Bought this for my dad and he loves it!! He cooks his soups, it's true what everyone says it's really hot and fast for a slow cooker. So if you want it for slow cooking don't buy it a pot of soup will cook under four hours."
1,This company is not to be trusted - highly recommend you do NOT PURCHASE their products,"When I used this product the very first time, the entire plate around the control knob MELTED! I contacted Amazon, who told me I must contact the manufacturer. So I did! They immediately gave me a return authorization and instructed me to return only the damaged part, which I did and I confirmed they received via UPS tracking. They too agreed, after I called them that they had received it. Told me it would take a while for the replacement. It has now been over three months and every time I contact them they tell me they will call me right back, etc and still nothing! I now have 2/3 of a crockpot that I can not use as I have been duped into returning the damaged pot."
1,Big...but not good quality,"This crock pot is junk! It gets way too hot on the outside, it cooks way too fast, chicken just gets tough. It is big which is why I bought it. Within the first few weeks the sticker that says hi lo ect. Now it has detached from base and I can't get it back in! I am going to return it."
4,8.5 Qt Slow Cooker,"We gave it as a Christmas gift to our daughter who has five children. This large family needed a large slow cooker. This is one of very few available. The others are Roasters, and not suitable for this kind of application. I would like to have seen (as I recall) more auto settings like 2-4 hour timer and auto shutoff like the Rival has which we have."
1,My wife loved it now that it's cracked. Not so much anymore.,I bought this as a gift and my wife loves it. I'm not sure what the people who have said it cooks to fast are doing but everything we have cooked has come out perfect. It does need to be on low or auto if you are using it as a slow cooker.If you put it on high its going to cook faster. This is an update to my last review on this product. It has cracked right down the middle and now leaks. I wouldn't recommend this crock pot to anyone. Unfortunately for me it is too late to return.
2,You get what you pay for!.....,"I know the price on this was low and I didn't expect this product to be top of the line, but I did expect them to be in one piece when I got them. I ordered 2 of them and they were fine. So I ordered 4 more as they worked great for cooking the roasts for a job I have. But the next 4 were all damaged and I needed to keep to of them as I needed to use them that week. I sent 2 back and ordered 2 more. Those 2 also had dents in them but not near as bad. I am just not very happy with this purchase at all. I didn't expect them to be top of the line as I stated, but not all damaged when I oepned them up! Also, the first 2 I ordered seemed to be a little different and made better than the next ones I ordered. And they WERE a little different after closer inspection. It was like they pulled out the bad stock just to get rid of them when I ordered more of them. I am still contemplating sending the last 2 back since I haven't used them yet."
1,The lid shattered!,"We purchased this slow cooker and as others have said, it seemed to cook really fast. We had an 8 pound pork loin and according to everything I saw, it should have taken about 9 1/2 to 10 hours on low or 7 1/2 hours on high. My husband put it in around noon and checked on it about 6:30. It looked done so he removed it, and cut it up. It was all dried out. He turned the cooker off, put the meat back in to keep it warm and put the top on it. I came home about 30 minutes and went in the kitchen to take a look. As I was leaning over to view, I heard a noise and all of the sudden, the handle on top of the lid blew off like a shotgun and the entire lid shattered. The bulk of the lid stayed together but shards of glass did drop into the cooker ruining the entire dinner. We called the company and they had never heard about this before. They are sending us a new one so we'll have to see on the next go around. I will update my review when I try out the new one..."
5,"Excellent ! Great size, does what it is supposed to do perfect!","I needed a large crock pot so i decided to order and try this elite 8.5 quart crock pot. i have used it about six times now, it does exactley what it is suposed to do and it does it well, the ceramic portion that holds the food is very nice heavy and thick, everything i have cooked in it comes out excellent, so far i have cooked 3 pot roasts, and 3 soups, they came out beautiful, it has been very ez to clean so far, i would definatley order another one."
1,Way too hot!,"After the first use the adhesive on the ""off high low"" came undone and slid off. I made soup and was ladling the soup into the bowl and added a little too much and my entire thumb blistered. The second time it was on the counter next to our butcher block and started melting the knife handles."
3,good size but the low cooking function is still too powerful,"I bought this cooker last year around Thanksgiving. Now, almost a year later, I still like this cooker despite its shortcomings:Pro:Very large pot. I cooked soup for the entire family and still have enough for leftover.Con:The settings aren't as you would expect. The low cooking function is still too powerful. Had to lift the cover almost every few mins after my soup reached boiling because the steam and liquid kept bursting out. I ended up leaving the lid open a small gap to avoid steam splashing.Because of too powerful low-setting, cannot really have it cook my meal overnight."
3,only 1 complaint,this slow cooker really cooks hot so it is meant to be at least 2/3 full or use a shorter time frame for cooking....the only problem I had was after the first use the control panel (High.low) peeled off from the heat.
2,The marketing hype is a lie. Pot gets too hot!,"The marketing hype is a lie - or at least a gross misrepresentation of reality.1. The Hype: ""300-watt"" Reality: It is either 355 watts or 260 watts.2. The Hype: ""slow cooker"" Reality: It is a ""fast cooker"".3. ""8-1/2-quart"" is really 8-quart. No big deal to me.4. ""dial for selecting Low, High, or Auto/Defrost""Reality: It gets to boiling/simmer regardles of the settings.--There is no internal thermostat that turns the heat down when it gets too hot.High = 355 watts of power. Low = 260 watts of power. FOREVER! NO AUTO SHUT-OFF.--Auto/Defrost has a mind of its own. A piece of frozen meat that does not sit flat on the bottom (where I think the sensor is) will switch from 355 watts to 260 watts prematurally.--NEVER EVER LEAVE POT UNATTENDED ALL DAY OR OVERNIGHT."
4,8.5 Quart Crock pot,This crock pot fits the quantity I need and heats up quickly and brings things to temp in a relatively short time. I love it and the price was right.
3,Fair .- good value for the money.,"The instruction does not have a picture or a section to tell you what are the functions of the switch.Good value for the price, large size, poor instruction manual, too hot even at low or defrost setting.Fill it up to about 1 inch from the rim or it will over boiled and make a mess.I wish it have a keep warm function.(wamrm only - not over boiling)I use to make Vietnamese soup ""Pho"".. cooking overnight."
1,Don't walk - Run from this product!,"We purchased this product 10/09 and by 1/10 the crock developed a hairline crack. We use two other crock pots several years older and there are no cracks on them, so we know how to care for the ceramic pot. Customer service points out that non-electric parts are not covered and provides a price list. A new crock shipped is almost thirty dollars. What a rip off when a new unit (that does cook too hot, even on the lowest settings) is forty dollars. Spend your money elsewhere, I know I will."
2,Bad quality,"Bought this crock pot because it was the biggest one out there; however, during the first use as the crock pot heated up, the label around the temperature knob peeled off. Now you cannot tell which setting is on, off, high, low, or med."
1,Junk - burns food on low setting,Received this for Christmas and I am stuck with it. I have used it twice and both times set it to cook on low setting with the end result of a burnt meal.
1,Product does not meet specifications,"It claims to be an 8.5 quart capacity slow cooker, which is 34 cups. I was only able to get 29 cups of water only in to the cooking vessel which makes it a 7.25 quart capacity cooker.I also verified the temperatures and found they are way too high for slow cooking. When set on low, the temperature reached 250 degrees whereas when tested against my older crock pot, the temperature was only 225 degrees, which is optimal for slow cooking. Water boiled away quickly on low. When tested on high, the internal temperature rose to 350 degrees where my old crock pot only went to 250. This item can't be considered a slow cooker with cooking temperatures like that.I had to return it the same day I received it."
5,replacement slow cooker,"This is my 2nd Elite, love it for the large size, perfect for large family.. Holds a large ham for cooking as well. Per other reviews, yes it does cook hot and fast, but I knew that and it is the only slow cooker I saw with a defrost button, we really like that option. I would buy it again."
1,Unethical Substitution,"AMAZON, please find another source and provider of this item.The original crock pot held a crock that weighs 9.5 lbs.The replacement sent to me (and that I paid for when the original crock cracked after 6 months)weighs 8 lbs.The heavier a ceramic product, the stronger it is and more clay is required to produce it. It's fired at a higher temperature (hence the strength) and the crock shrinks in size accordingly.I asked Maxi-Matic to extend the warranty on the new crock since it was a poor substitution. They would not. Patti told me to ""take it up with the Better Business Bureau,"" and that the owner would not speak with me, plus he was 'out of the office' anyway.I really hope AMAZON finds another source for this item, even if it costs more. Ethics in business is a trait too difficult to come across these days, and the companys that conduct an ethical business should be rewarded generously."
4,"Good product, beware of lid shattering to pieces","I had mine at least 3 years. It worked great. My lid shattered today while I had ribs in the crockpot. I think it is a rarity, but it happened to me. I always hand washed the lid and pot."
3,liers,it said it was 17 x13 x10/3/4 its not its 15.5 x 11.5 its the same size as my 6 qt only an inch deeper i was looking for one that was longer and wider to cook down deer heads for skull mounts it will work.. better than paying 80 bucks they want for the buck boiler
1,we need an english-speaking manual sent to us. you sent us a spanish-speaking manual asap.,"you sent us a spanish-speaking manual for this product. we need an english-manual sent to us asap. we don't want to have to send this back; but, will have to if you don't send us an english-speaking manual."
3,What we found out,"We already enjoy several videos by this same publisher and were hoping to seemore GREAT scenes. However what we found is that this video is 50% cut and paste from videos we already own. Overall the video is short too. Thus, the 50% that is new footage to us is very brief. If this is your first purchase of this series, I think you will give it 5 stars. Just know that if you are coming back for more, there are not alot of new sights to be seen."
3,okay,"these swords are okay, they're just cut pieces of steel, but they are sturdy and sharp, but the handles suck. for the money though, great swords."
5,Finally a shade that fits!,"I couldn't find a shade that fits, and was concerned that the hefty price of this one wouldn't be worth it. Almost three years later, and I am still very pleased!"
5,Riviting,"After reading ""The Sigma Project"" I have to say I found it right up there with ""The Da Vinci Code"" in that it was fast moving, informative and an excellent medical thriller. Dr. Stern brought characters to life right from the first page and wrote medical language that could be easily understood by any lay person. An excellent fast moving read that I highly recommend."
3,"fast, brutal and still black","I was a bit skeptical about how this mcd would sound like. I do not care for the new trends in Black Metal such as the electronic dabblings of new Dodheimsgard or the overproduction of Dimmu Borgir. I am pleased to say, however, that Satyr and Frost have stayed evil. Not a must have, but a nice taste of the new album due out in the fall will be like."
4,Good Stuff,"People keep looking at me like I'm weird, but I find black metal relaxing.. Anyways, this is very pleasent to listen to. I enjoy it, especially the last track, which is particularly relaxing."
3,"OK, I guess.","I didn't spend a lot for this, so I guess I'm getting what I paid for. I wish I had saved my money and put it toward a metal one though. As far as function, it works. I just don't see it lasting very long or staying accurate. It is supposed to be held against the edge of a table when you use it by a lip in the front. Mine wouldn't lay flat because of 2 blobs of plastic from the manufacturing process. I was able to easily saw these off with the included hand saw. It now lies flat, but I'm worried the plastic will get distorted with normal use. I will probably use it to draw lines and score the wood and make the actual cuts without it."
1,Don't buy it,It's plastic and the saw cuts through the plastic. Buy one that's aluminum! I wasted my time and money. Don't buy this product.
4,Good for small projects,"This miter box was very useful for my wood aerial model of Lower Manhattan. My radial arm saw was too much for a lot of the small pieces I had to cut.Saw is sharp. The only issue for me was the plastic body of the box. After several cuts, a groove is forming inn the soft plastic. The plastic feels just like the wood in terms of hardness so it's hard to know when to stop cutting.Jim"
1,Don't use this vendor,"Have been waiting for over a month. Never got the item, and never got the credit back this vendor stinks."
3,Good book; pics a bit fuzzy,This book was a gift and they loved the content and info in the book. The only criticism I heard was that several or many of the pics are a bit fuzzy and should have been clearer. Good book otherwise.
4,KATELAND,"GREAT PAGEANTRY..The Red Earth Festival. Indians proudly representing their native tribes in Dance. Seeing all the beautiful colors in their fantastic costumes was a spectacular sight. Many of these costumes are made with beads and feathers as they demonstrate their many kinds of dance. There is the CHICKEN DANCE which is a jerking action of the neck, The womens SHAWL DANCE preformed in their very beautiful colored shawls, and there is the JINGLE DANCE. This is indian CULTURE, TRADITION, and BEAUTY. You will also see a competition display of Indian Art, BASKETRY, SCULPTURE, JEWELRY, and PAINTINGS. I have given this documentary just 4 stars, I think for a fine documentary such as this, the picture quality could have been a little better."
4,A Most Pleasant Surprise!,"I was quite familiar with Mr. Yan and his recipies, because the cat next door keeps me up nights with her howling and I watch his late-nite infomercials. From watching him I used to think Mr. Yan could not tell a water chestnut from a walnut, if you catch the meaning of my drift.So then I find his book at a church rummage sale, and I think this is good toilet reading for sure. I try his recipe for Flaky Szechuan Tofu Patties on a dare, and what do you know, it is delicious! It was so good it cost me a bet with my fry cook!So now I use Mr. Yan's recipies every day in my kitchen. I have a month's worth of specials thanks to this book, it has made my life that much easier! Can you too cook delicious Chinese food? Yes you Yan!"
5,I know Martin Yan and Martin says...,"this is his best book.I am a pro cook, and have met and talked to Martin on several occasions at professional conferences. He says this is his best cookbook. I have used it, as well as a couple of other of his cookbooks. I agree, it's his best.Besides, who am I to argue with Martin!"
5,Islands,"To have the gift of a group of friends like the one in Islands is a blessing. Read about them and share their lives. If you don't have friends like these, try to make at least one really close friend who'll share your life with you."
2,Slightly Depressing,"The characters in this book were very strange and sad. The happy parts were overly gushy, reminding my of when I was young and naive and still believed in the abilty to really live happily ever after. I don't mean to sound like a pessamist, but really, this book carries an unrealistic idea of what life is like. There were no middle areas where things were just okay, it was extreme happiness or extreme sadness, which isn't realistic. The happy parts reminded me of the end of a romance novel gushing orgasmic joy over things being ""perfect"".On the other side of things, I definately give Anne Rivers Siddons credit for the ending - with the way the book was going I was never even remotely expecting the ending. It was a real shock to me and it left me feeling puzzled and thinking ""what just happened!?"""
4,enjoyable,"Although Islands is by no means as good as Outer Banks, Colony or some of ARS's earlier books, I do feel that this is better than her last few. I bought the book because I love ARS but I was worried that I would not enjoy based on several of the reviews. I found it to be a very enjoyable read and more true to her style of writing."
2,Past her Prime?,"I've read and enjoyed several of Siddon's other books, and her descriptions of places, customs, climate, food often make you feel you've been there, but to this book I often said, ""Blah, blah, blah-who cares?"" As I was trapped in airports and airplanes I read the whole thing in a day. Actually I skipped over some of the descriptions because her writing was unimaginative, methodical, repetitive....boring. I think I'll go back and actually count the number of times she used the word ""obscurely""as an (obscure to be sure) adverb. Doesn't she have an editor? Do writers get paid by the page?"
4,Good light read,"The newest novel by this talented author takes place in the Low Country of South Carolina - Charleston and the islands of her shores. While the plot is somewhat predictable, the descriptions are quite good. I could ""see"" the scenes. The dialogue moved the story along. I was pulled in from the beginning and read the entire book in record time.This is a wonderful for an in front of the fire or by the pool type read. It doesn't take much thinking power, but is enjoyable none the less. What I really like in a story is well defined characters who stay true throughout the book. I found this with Islands. I also enjoy strong relationships, which I also found with this read.Ms. Siddons' fans will surely enjoy this latest effort. I would also recommend it to those who enjoy reading about the Low Country and beautiful, wealthy people with strong relationships. This was my first read by Ms Rivers Siddons and I enjoyed it as a good light read."
3,Slow Starting,"I'd been wanting to try Siddons, but maybe I choose the wrong book. I've started and finished 3 other books while trying to get going on this one. After 83 pages, I'm going to give it up and try another of her books.It just feels like the characters are drifting. The descriptions setting the scene appeals, but Anny Butler seems so low-key that she is almost a nonentity."
1,A disappointment,"A friend recommended this book to me as a treat in preparation for my vacation to Charleston with my mother. So I sent her a copy for us to read together. It was not a treat. I was disappointed there were not enough descriptions about Charleston and the Low Country. I've been to lovely Charleston and Beaufort and this book didn't make it recognizable. I agree that character development was shallow. What was that mess in Mexico that made no sense? And, nothing is more aggravating than reading a 'professionally' written book with TYPOS! And repetitious descriptions. The ending was implausible and a rush to have some closure. PLEASE do not compare this author to the talented Pat Conroy. So we waded through the 'pluff mud' of Islands, and are giving Siddons another chance with Peachtree Road, but my mother has finished it, calling it 'bizarre'. Gee - can't wait."
1,My favorite author seems to be losing it.,"I have read every one of Anne Rivers Siddons's books. Some I have read twice because I like them so much. I have even finished the last page of one of her books and turned back to page one and started over again because I didn't want to leave the characters. When I started to read Islands, I had just finished reading Low Country and was very disappointed with it so I was hoping that this would be the work of the author that I loved. It started out badly. The quick way she met, married the doctor and was accepted into his old childhood group was not believable. After that I wondered at times if I was reading a novel or a travel brochure. Since she had no plot, she filled the pages with descriptions of the beach, the ocean, Charleston, the food they ate, ad nauseum. And I won't even mention the ending which was totally unbelievable. That's two in a row that I didn't like. I wonder if I will buy another one of her books."
2,Not One of Her Best,"I have been an avid reader of Anne Rivers Siddons books since ""Homeplace"", written in the late '80's. Her last three books, have been very disappointing to me including ""Islands"".While Siddons still has a ""feel"" for the Carolina Lowcountry, where I live, she has lost her ability to make her characters seem plausible and alive. Her plot in this last book is disjointed and boring. I almost put it down without finishing it but then read about the strange ending so I perservered and sure enough, the ending was terrible. Upon closing the cover I had to pronounce it a waste of time and the ending disjointed from the plot. It made no sense to follow these close friends through years of ups and downs only to find out one is a murderer! I sincerely hope Ms. Siddons can and will return to her writing style that was present in ""King's Oak"", ""Colony"", and the ""Outer Banks"". These, to me, are her best efforts."
3,More Low Country,"Anne Rivers Siddons' Islands is set in the Carolina Low Country.It's the story of a group of life-long friends who share a beach house and become closer to each other than they are to their families. The narrator of this seemingly idlyllic tale is Anny, who, at age thirty-five, marries Lewis, and becomes enfolded into the group. There is, however, a serpent in their Eden, and what begins as a lovely reminiscence of times past turns into a suspense story.As usual, Siddons characterizations are strong, and, with the addition of the suspense element, her plot moves along nicely. However, she's a bit more impressed with the glories of the Low Country than I am. I find her constant repetitions of local color to be a bit tedious and intrusive."
2,Pure Torture,"I have read this author before, but this book was pure torture to read. It was excruciatingly boring, with little plot. The main character, Anny, was sickeningly sweet and naive. The only good thing I got from the story was the friendship of the couples, but even that was shallow. YUCK."
2,"Gentle read, but you'll end up depressed","Anny joins the Scrubs, a group of self-indulgent, self-absorbed folks, who just can't grow up. Without realizing it, she morphs from confident, caring, community worker to a skittish, selfish, Scrub. When tragedy strikes, she elects to lie in bed, rather than attend the funeral service of one of the group's members. Thankfully, the member's daughter blasts her and tells her how selfish she is, especially since her mother liked Anny best of the group. (That zinger was my favorite part of the whole read.)Great details, but I did end up flipping ahead to get things moving along. The ending was abrupt and felt like the author knew she had run out of gas and needed a big finish.I didn't like any of the characters and was wishing for their comeuppance until the end of the read."
2,How much to sacrifice for the sake of the story?,"One more plea for better writing or editing.... I live in Charleston and found several of her facts to be a bit ""confused"" now and then, but when that sailboat was found lying on its side in the water, I just had to consult my own sailboat expert. He assures me that this kind of sailboat (with what's called a weighted keel) could *never* end up like that! -- unless the keel is removed, and if that was the case, the story should have included that information. A sailboat like this is like a kid's tippy cup: it will right itself.Running into such flawed writing is just like running aground in our beloved pluff mud. A sad situation."
3,Yawn........,"This was one of the most borning and slow moving books I have ever read, and was extremely disapointing. There was no action or plot until the last 10 pages of the book!!!This story drifted endlessly with no apparent plot into the lives of a clicky group of rich upper-class couples who happened to have associations with the medical community. The couples were snotty, uppidity, and definately set apart from the average citizen. They called themselves ""the scrubs,"" and shared a beachhouse on one of the islands near Charleston, NC.Happines and tragedy befall these couples. With each event, page after page of boring recovery left me feeling ""All right, all ready, lets get on with the story!""I gave it a 3 only because the author was able to give the reader insight into the beauty of the area: however, she could have said it in 1/2 the pages.Only l member of our book club enjoyed the story."
3,Sad and a bit unnerving but inspiring at times,"The character telling the story is at least 15 years younger than the rest of the individuals that make up the close-knit group of friends. One member dies and then the narrative jumps 10 years. In time there is another death. I started to get worried that all the characters other than the story teller were going to die before the novel ended. I'm happy to say that wasn't the case.I found that through the story, events would happen, and I'd expect each event to be followed by some sort of tragedy. Sometimes that was the case, but often life would just continue to happen. It was a little unsettling.Although tragedies do occur, it is a bit inspiring to read how the lives of the living continue and the support they have for one another. There are also characters who are truly good people at the core. On the flip side, there is a bit of a sinister twist at the end."
3,It didn't grab me immediately,"I actually haven't read this yet - but I started it. It does not seem to be the strong start that I've experienced with her other books. But, I'm reading it on my Kindle, and I'm new to the Kindle. I have read other books on it, and got right into them. I haven't been able to just get right into this. The character development hasn't grabbed me yet, so I actually put it aside and I'm reading something else right now. I do love the other work I've read of this author so I will eventually finish this one too."
2,Not her best work!,"I usually love Siddons books. I was excited to find one that I had not read yet at the airport a few weeks ago.This book had me either crying or stumped the whole read. The character development was good to a point. But, i agree with a previous poster that says how unrealistic it was for the doctor to own so many houses. Yet, they never set up a home.The 'evil' character by the end of the book had me wondering where that idea came from. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not read it. I found the plot turn with the fire to be too much.Not one of her best books. I had liked it up until the point where a dog goes missing and a fire is started."
2,Too much!,"Although I have enjoyed ARS earlier works like Colony and Outer Banks, I find myself getting more and more impatient with each successive offering. I found Islands to be nothing more than one overlong description after another of the too, too wonderful southern climate (even though it is laden with unbearable humidity and mosquitoes), landscape (can pluff mud be mentioned one more time?) cozy houses (all main characters own several, of course), furnishings (lots of rump sprung sofas, whatever that is), wonderful dogs and over privileged people who manage to look like teenagers well into their golden years. All of this puncuated with an occasional death, disappearance or discovery of infidelity thrown in to keep the reader's interest. I, like another reviewer, found myself skimming over some of the more unbearable blather in a desperate search for a plot!"
1,Terrible!!,"In my opinion, ""Islands"" is an unreadable piece of work. I found it completely contrived, the characters one dimensional, and the dialogue ridiculous.I have read and enjoyed every Anne Rivers Siddons book written, with the exception of this book. I can't really put my finger on it, but this book made my skin crawl!!"
1,BORING,"Before I left for the holidays, I picked up a few books to read. I remembered one of my relatives highly suggested Siddons' ""Colony"". The store I was in did not have Colony so I picked up ""Islands"". While I love to read all kinds of books and relish the different writing styles, this book was an absolute torture. It's about a group of spoiled, completely self absorbed adults with no aim in life except to 'be'. The story is incredibly shallow, yet with an enormous amount of silly details that don't tie into anything within the story. All along while reading, I kept saying to mayself this has to get better, NOTHING can be this bad...folks, it NEVER does. Actually, I found it got progressively worse with each page turned. If, indeed, Siddon's other works were decent perhaps this one was simply written to ride on the coat tails of the previous successes for nothing else but quick release and quick $. Not worth folks. One of the worse reads I ever spent time on!"
4,"History, from an economic perspective ...","Miron Burgin is an european who studied in Harvard, and who wrote for his doctorate thesis this great book, ""The Economic Aspects of Argentine Federalism, 1820-1852"".Truth to be told, it is not overly entertaining, but that is not its aim. Burgin's ambition was to shed come light on the importance of the economic aspects of Argentine Federalism. He writes quite fluently, and even though he gives lots of data, he somehow manages to surprise the reader, from time to time, with an appreciably good remark. He thinks that there is a noteworthy connection between the original institutional problem and the deficient economic structure of the country, and supports that belief with facts and intelligent considerations.On the whole, a very good book, that I can recommend to those that are interested in Argentina's history."
2,Not really that good...,"Like those stirring Nazi propaganda films, this movie has it all: chiseled cheekbones, black&white film, chaste love, sacrifice for country. And likewise, it uses all of those to cover for shallow plot and shameless please-don't-shoot-me-Stalin sentimental storylines.I'll admit it's hopelessly romantic and a good waste of 90 minutes; the scenery is beautiful, the camera-work is great, and the story is calculated to tug at the ol' heartstrings. But at the same time, realize that the emotions you're feeling aren't genuine - they're delivered, from Russia, without love."
5,A small masterpiece,"I've seen this film about 30 times (now that it's on DVD from Russia, and from a gorgeous print, a few more times). Each time there is something new, something more profound, some small piece of action or shading of character that takes on new meaning. Of all the ""war"" films, I think this and ""The Cranes Are Flying"" are two of the most remarkeable to come out of the former Soviet Union during the Cold War period. I was mesmerized by this film the first time I saw and continue to be almost 40 years later. I'm not sure how many other films can make that claim."
5,Venerable masterpiece!,"The Soviet Cinema produced two unforgettable filmic gems during the Fifties. Ivan's childhood (Andrei Tarkovsky) and this one.The narrative pulse, the visual aesthetic, the stuning landscapes, the employment of the camera are a feast for your senses.Chuckhrai made his masterwork with notable assertiveness, a film that could have fallen into a simple account of the affective memories of a teenager at the Fornt of War. But the narative thread supported a movie that grows and grows before our eyes with organical flow and genuine artistic commitment.That's why this movie is included by Facets as one of the 600 Best Foreign Films ever, without including the nomination as Best Foreign Film for the members of the Academy.This is without discussion a towering masterwork. Don't miss it by any pretext."
4,The best known Soviet film about WWII,"This review id for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Ballad of a Soldier, released with the Russian language title of ""Ballada o soldate"" is one of the best known and most loved films of post war Soviet Russia.In the film, a young soldier on the front lines fights off two enemy tanks al by himself. As a reward for his heroism, his commander grants him 6 days of leave to visit his mother and repair a leaky room at their home. On his way hom he encounters many people who have hope of victory. He meets a young woman and falls in love with her.The DVD only has one special feature which is an audio interview (accompanied by a slideshow) of cast & crew fillowing a screening in New York.There is another edition of the film released on DVD by the Russian Cinema Council (RUSCICO) that has other good special features.I recommend both versions!"
3,Good content - bad presentation,"When it was listed as spiral bound, I expected a spiral bound book. Instead I received a three ring binder filled with poor photo copies. I bought it because of the reviews and still expect to have the same success with the content as the other reviewers, but it's a bit pricey for a bunch of photo copies, some of which are barely readable."
1,I can't believe Cannon STILL makes these crappy towels!,"I bought several Santa Cruz towels, on a recommendation from someone I knew. Those towels were the worst towels I have ever had; they frayed like make and became horrible looking. They are long since gone from my house. Anyway, I have other Cannon towels that are still very good and usuable, after almost 16 years(they were wedding gifts).Cannon products are ones that alot of us grew up with, and many have last thirty years or more. These Santa Cruz, though, are mistakes that Cannon has made and should get rid of the line altogether."
3,Madness,"Badibi tells the whole world that if Goten,Trunks, and Piccolo don't show themselves, Babidi will destroy the Earth in five days.Speaking of Piccolo, he is not a weakling Piccolo still got the same power he did whent He fight Andriod 17 and imperfect Cell (After he fused with Kami). The creaters just want Goku and Vegeta to destroy the bad guy, not the others:Yamcha, Tien, and krillin.Thats what i dislike about DBZ. Piccolo Fuses with Nail and then Kami. Why dose only the saiyians destroy the villian? Ther's some other stuff, Gohan becomes S.S2 and releashes the Z sword and Buu destroys cites bumping Babidi into walls. (Preety funny!) Goku asks if Goten knows what Semutirey is and Trunks say's that Goten dosn't know what it is and Goku and Piccolo demostrates the Fusion dance with Piccolo. Like i said funny! But enough. But Goten beter hurry up becase Buu took away 2/3 of the earth's population. Not even the national Army can stop the pink flub."
3,Supreme Kia?-uuuuhhhhhhh........,"This movie offered very little action, and was somewhat sort of boring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,well, they didn't fight. They only good parts was when Mr. Buu turned the city into Jawbreakers, and when Goku explained the fusion technique. The whole ""Z Sword"" thing was dumb.....................worth a see"
4,the battle that determined a nation,I am a canadian. But I always have been interested about american history. I knew a little about the battle. But not its players. This was the first modern war. Using new weapons like rifled cannon and observation balloons. But these men who fought for what they believed in were larger than life. Chamberlain of the 20th maine made me realise that you are not born to fight. But that you are thrust into one. The movie was very good. It developed the story well. Its a good movie to teach the kids today about what war is really like. Because just think if the union had failed what would have happened to the history of the world today.
4,Lady Rhea rocks,"Great book, but wish it haad more pictures. Anyone looking for an alternative way of 'talking' to the universe should get it. So far it's helped me in my drive for bettering my, and those around me, life. Even if all it does is help drive me towards my goals, because I'm activly thinking about them on a daily bases with the candles I've made, it's helped."
5,Excellent performance of a very good operetta,"Gypsy Baron is one of Strauss's best operettas and this is one of the best performances I have seen of it. The cast is excellent (this was the performance that launched Sigfried Jerusalem's career); they sung well and looked and acted their parts. Scenery, much of which was filmed on location, is beautiful and costumes are bright and attractive. Although the movie was made in 1975, it has been transfered to digital very well and sounds and looks as good as a current recording"
2,Not for me,This cookbook has a lots of southwestern recipes which I am not a big fan of! The inside overall look of the book is boring.
2,Very bad,I ordered this book in hopes of reading a great artist's work instead I got a book that came in pieces. Torn in half. Badly damaged. The life of this book was greatly disadvantaged because of this reason. The pages will surely tear easily & the artist's words will be no more. For shame.
2,Know what you're getting...,"I bought this punch the other day because I thought it was a cool idea.I have several thumb punches and they work well and fairly easily. This one is difficult to use. It cuts through, but you really have to push quite hard on it. I also discovered that the flower never fully punches out because there are two notches on opposite sides of each other.After some research I discovered that the notches allow the flower to be folded over for a 3D effect. If the flower is to be used on its own, then it has to be punched out the rest of the way by hand. Not a problem, as long as you know that's what you're supposed to do.That info. should be stated on the package."
1,Disatisfied with this punch,"It was not sharp at all, I have tried with many stuff but it didn't work at all, it doesn't cut. I have throw it"
5,phenomenal!!!,"what you did not read in the description but if you are reading this you probably already know that not only angry anderson is the vocalist but phil rudd from ac/dc was the drummer as well, regardless this was a rare breed of rock n roll in australia back in 1973 when this record was released, this is very hard and heavy, no they dont sound like rose tattoo or ac/dc but very powerful for an oz band, think buffalo with a more uptempo sound, if you are a fan of 70s hard rock this is a must own cd, this also includes bonus tracks and a fantastic 6 sleeve foldout and great liner notes on buster browns history as well as vintage photos, it is interesting to see angry anderson with hair ha ha, anyway grab this one and enjoy it is great!!!!!!!!"
4,Enjoyable yeading,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is light reading. Makes you stop and think about how it would be if you were in the same circumstances. Especially if you had a step-daughter.I would highly recommend this book. Would even consider ordering another book by the same author in the future.
2,Just so so,This book came across as a bit boring. I found myself skimming pages and pages and then wondering if I really missed something in all of that skimming. It was nice to read about Denise but it felt like she just hooked up with her dad to quickly. What 14 year old girl just takes to an absentee father and his lover so quickly? Maybe Denise and Lucy just clicked. Perhaps I missed that. I did like the part where Lucy told Ash she was pregnant and he was going to leave only he couldn't so he wanted her keys so he could leave in her car. Instead she just leaves. Would appear that decision will come back to haunt her.
5,A profound and insightful book,"I was hesitant to purchase this book because of the controversial nature of the topic, but once I had picked up the book and started to read it I could not put it down. I read it from cover to cover - there are very few books I can say I have done that. It is the autobiography of the most controversial author and white civil rights leader in the country. It talks about his life, his evolution and his awakening. It discusses very intimate details about the National Alliance, the cosmotheist church and many other very fascinating topics. The book is about 400+ pages and give you insights you may have never dreamed of before. This is one of those must read books."
2,"Great technique, real fast, real boring.","John 5 is an incredible player, and incredibly hyped. A guy who is marketed as ""Manson's ex lead guitarist"", etc., with shaved-off eyebrows, dyed hair, lipstick, and nail polish should be eaily dismissed as a ""poser""...but suprisingly John 5 is EXTREMELY talented. His technique and speed are mind bogglingly good. However...To me, his style is very linear, like he's playing 400 notes per second constantly, just over different backing tracks. He does not play ""country"". He plays shred metal over a blugrass backing track, with a couple of double stop bends thrown in just to make it sound country ""enough"". He is very entertaining to listen to, and I am blown away by some of his licks and noise ""tricks"", but he lacks feeling. That type of feeling that will keep this CD in my player for more than 30 minutes...after that, I just get bored. For a more ""soulfull"" shred-fest, I recommend Liquid Tension, Dream Theater, or anything with John Pertucci, Via, Satch..."
2,Dont belive all the hype!,"Up there with Satriani/Vai! Yeah right! My main gripe about this album was the backing. It seemed to me very guitar magazine CD backing track, theres no connection with the other instruments. Dont get me wrong John5 is technically an amazing guitarist but his guitar playing is so much more advance then the bass, rhythm and drums it sounds isolated. Whilst on Satriani/Vai albums you also get to hear Jeff Campiteli, Stu Hamm, The Bisonette brothers, Mike Mangini, and so on. His song/riff writing is no where near Satriani/Vai standards either. If you wanna hear an amazing guitar album get Franks Zappa's 'Shut up and play yer guitar', its in a different class."
3,o.k,"ok, I love John-5 he is AMAZING and I'm bummed that he's not in Manson anymore. And i really love Marilyn Manson as well. So when I heard he was coming out with an album I was so happy. This album is John. Not Manson. I was dissapointed at first because I was expecting something very Mansony. But then I realized that you know this is John's stuff. So I would give this album three stars. It isn't Incredible or anything, I think its really good gutiar wise even though the songs can be a little long. Don't buy this if ur expecting a whole Marilyn Manson Album...this isn't it. If you respect John-5 and just wanna hear him, then get this Album but have you expations loose for this one..."
3,UNusual,"What a really unusual, different out of this world, good imagination movie with absolutely little time to prepare for the storyline and plot Remindas me of the MANNITHOU!!"
4,What's in the basket?,"Leaking with saturated stupidity, this messy B-movie horror is great fun to absorb.You've got nice guy Duane looking out for his ""little"" brother Belial. And when I say little, I'm talking about a one foot tall blob of goo. These bros are siamese twins, seperated at birth.Belial is nothing more than a few deformed pounds of a rubbery fleshy head and arms. Looks like a preschoolers silly putty creation. He looks lovably cheesy.Just don't get too attached. His bite is vicious. The ratio of blood spewage his little fangs can produce from his victims is way out of proportion.So yes, it's ridiculous campy with the excessive gore and bad acting. But it spawned a couple of sequels, so it will appeal to some sick freaks."
5,Good Exchange.,"Fast service, good exchange. Was at my door before I knew it. I will likely buy again from this dealer"
2,"A good buy, but go with ""Brain Damage"" for a good Hennenlotter film","Yes, this movie is a ""classic"" but its really really bad. I mean I love bad movies, take ""Troll 2"" or ""Rumpelstiltskin"" for example, but this movie is nowhere near as good as Hennenlotter's ""Brain Damage"" which is what I expected it would be like in terms of good horror movie film-making. It's worth having for a horror movie collector like myself, but not even in my top 50. Blu Ray quality - it keeps is 4:3 aspect ratio. According to Hennenlotter in the special features it looked like crap in widescreen. Picture quality looks like an upgraded VHS."
2,a,I dont get why this movie gets so much praise. The picture quality is so bad that its almost unwatchable. The effects are unbearable. I do like the idea though. This would make a nice project for a modern remake.
2,picure of basket case- +--(@_@)--+,"basket cake sucks. Its about a little chunk of rubber that goes around town with his brother killing doctors.This movie is funny,though. P.S. Im not really 3 yrs. old. P.P.S. What kind of toddlers write internet reviews,anyway?"
3,Twins rock!,"what can be said? Basket-boy seemed more upset that he had been seperated from his brother by a Veteraniarian, rather than a human doctor. since both kinds of doctors have the exact same training, it seems a bit thin that Buliah (Basket-boy) couldn't fine anything alse to be mad about. Perhaps that arm that grows out of the top of his head is a bit annoying. there is some interesting animation of Buliah that reminds me of much older films. he travels the city by toilet plumbing (oh yuuccch!) looking for his sworn enemy and kills innocent people with aplomb. His brother scolds him, but Basket-boy can't be stopped and unleashes terror that's unspeakable! It's so gross. it's funny, and repulsive simetanianously. If you're looking for a cult film, you have found it in Basketcase."
2,"Cult classic...please, a waste of my childhood","i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit, but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting. The ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world.Dont even rent this, i dont even know why you are considering the film.I only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since."
4,Something for Everybody,"You just never know what you're going to read in this enormous book -- everything from downright awful and stupid to truly wonderful. M. Christian scores (as usual), as does Alison Tyler, so it was fun to read overall. What I like best about this book (and the ones that came before it) is the inclusion of some new writers -- people who might be new on the scene, which can often be a refreshing diversion from the usual stuff. Definitely worth the money. With a book this big, you can't expect to like everything!"
3,An informative map,"This single sided map contains a lot of history and information without being too verly cluttered with facts or notations. It shows the main research facilities on the continent and is useful for school programs and just for information. A folded map, it is too bad that they did not also use the reverse to provide other information or show maps of the more highlighted areas of the ice, the Vinson Massiff, McMurdo and Dry Valleys, or the Antarctic Peninsula."
5,Wonderful! Awsome! Awe Inspiring!,"WOW! What else can I say but wow? I have been waiting for a book like this to come out for a long time. Now, I know this review isn't a sophisticated a some, but take it from me, this is a book that should be on everyone's christmas list. Every word in this book is a song waiting to be sung. Shara Mc Callum give us truth in every poem and you can tell that she put every bit of herself into these poems. This book has impacted my life like no other."
2,How does one Read a Nostradamus Book?,"Having heard about his prophecies for as long as I can remember, I finally decided to jump into the mystery by purchasing & reading ""The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus"". Unfortunately, the book does not include a legend or other explanatory notes on how to translate time. Each chapter is titled ""Century I,"" ""Century II,"" etc. The best I could guess is that Century I is perhaps the 16th Century, based on the date of Nostradamus' Forward to his son (1555). This single issue renders the book meaningless, since Nostradamus is famous for not being straight about what he's prophesizing, which apparently was the only way he could steer clear of the Pope's tyranny."
2,only zoo med product i don't like...,"quality is good, only thing is the descriptions of the product. it says rock but its actually made of some fiber but its durable. and another thing is the picture shows rock like color and it even says rock but for the large size, it only comes in green or pink. wth zoo med? you could've made it look a little more natural"
2,Small = Large,"I ordered the small corner dish for my gecko cage. How stupid of me to expect something that was actually small. This thing is pretty massive, and I would definitely not recommend unless you have a much bigger cage."
5,Nice deep hot tub,"My Water Dragon loves his new deeper ""hot tub"". I would suggest you carefully measure your cage (or aquarium) to make sure the size will work once it's inside the habitat. When I got the dish it was too large for the aquarium. We could have sent it back, but instead we modified it to fit because we wanted the deeper pool."
5,I use 3 of these!,"I'm a reading specialist and work with small groups. I like to have one of these charts for each group. I can put sight words and phonics skill cards in the pockets. I set them up at the end of my workday, and they're ready for the next lesson! I have a large white board and a big hanging pocket chart near my table where I teach, but this is very convenient to set on the table. I also purchased a couple of less expensive tabletop pocket charts, but these are much better quality and have more pockets, so I hardly ever use the less expensive ones."
5,Fantastic Filter,"Recently used this filter for taking pictures of the water falls at Yosemite on bright, sunny days and it did everything I expected for taking long exposures. I would highly recommend this filter for anyone wanting to take long exposures on sunny days."
2,Disappointing,"Although some of the stories in this book are well written,heartfelt and moving, many are in need of major editing. Teens are at an impressionable time of life, and are charged with havign to learn the English language for all its stylistic nuances. By reading stories such as those in this book, it brings to question whether or not they will pick up some bad habits. While it is great to give teens a place to express themselves, it is surprising that such works are published without cleaning them up. If they are the best works of thousands upon thousands of submissions, perhaps there is some work to be done."
4,A little large...,"This shirt has the appearance of lasting a very long time. Thick weave material, fairly soft now but will improve with washing. 4 stars for fit. I normally wear an XL but this shirt is easily a XXL and I do not foresee if shrinking very much..."
5,Great Product,Good quality for the price. I use these for my Company shirts and they are very durable and clean looking.
5,Great fit and look,"Great fit and look, very business like. Needs very little care, just wash and hang to dry. Fast delivery I will buy again."
5,Mil-Spec work shirt!!!!,I feel like a man when i wear this shirt. Its is manufactured to a high degree of quality and upholds Dickey's rugged and work horse style. Fits great and feels even better. Out the dryer wrinkle free and has not frayed at all. I can see why mechanics wear this style of shirt. All in all 5 thumbs up and i'll be buying more. Amazon beats ass!!!
3,Decent shirt,Not a whole lot to say here...it's a work shirt. I was a little surprised because the gray was a lot darker in person than the photos. The fabric is tough but the stitching is a little cheapo. I already have a couple of threads haning off of the button holes. I would have given it a higher rating but it's really not any better quality than the work shirts over at walmart for $10.
5,Nice shirts and INCREDIBLE free shipping,"First the shirts: I am 5'6"", 130Lbs (short, skinny) and ordered 3 smalls, in black, khaki, and dark navy for work at a tool shop. The shirts fit well and are very well made. Definitely will hold up better than a T.Secondly, I have never had a package shipped through Prestige, however I ordered these shirts Friday at 2am (very late Thursday night) and they were on my doorstep today, Monday at noon. That's 2 day shipping (Kentucky to Pennsylvania) and I didn't pay a cent (free super saver option selected). Absolutely hands down the best shipping service I've ever dealt with, I'm totally blown away and cannot offer enough praise. Good work Amazon, good work Prestige, good work Dickies.100% satisfied."
3,Sizing,"Dickies workshirts are wll made. Thje are very generous with their sizing. I purchased 2XL which is the size I normally wear. When I opened the shirt packaging and tried on the shirt, I look like a little kid wearing my dad's clothes.The bummer is that the shirt cannot be returned to Amazon once you open the packaging. I am disappointed!"
2,Weird fit,"Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit. The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in, but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much. We're required to wear these where I work, and tucked in, so the strange (boxy almost) cut makes it keep coming untucked. The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit, I would but a million!"
5,Love it!,The quality of this shirt is very good. It also looks great and is comfortable. Looking forward to purchasing more.
5,Dickies Men's Short Sleeve Shirt,This Dickie Men's Short Sleeve Shirt is an excellent quality! This is the third time I have ordered. I would recommend this item as a great merchandise to order.
3,My size is too big for me,"I knew this was a great casual everyday shirt. But for my size (XXL), this shirt is too big. You may want to buy 1-2 sizes down your own size to be sure that it fits perfectly. Also I selected XXL in the order page but what I got was 2XL. I don't know if they are the same size with only different labeling, but I assumed it to be. Will be ordering a new one soon with a smaller size."
5,Dickies Work Shirts,"I used to wear these shirts a lot. I've had about four in black, two in charcoal, one in brown, and another in khaki. I wouldn't just wear them to work though. Like my Dr. Martens, they're great for daily wear too. I also have a Dickies reversible belt I wear all the time, and a Dickies cap too. I like Dickies much better than Carhartt, because Dickies always fits well and looks great."
4,Very durable,Great shirt. Very durable. I bought a size smaller than I normally would based on reviews and wish I hadn't. I would go with my normal size in the future.
5,LOVE DICKIES SHIRTS,"I have one of these shirts that I LOVE.I wear a Large which fits my shoulders perfectly and hangs somewhat loosely over my chest and at least 6 inches past my pants line. I love the feel and because I don't tuck it in I get great breezes etc. in the summer heat. It is made of very tough material so I think it will last the color has held through MANY washings of my own and I actually bought it used so who knows what it went through before I got it.I'm buying four more today in different colors.UPDATE (July 27th, 2010): I don't know if they changed their sizing but I seem to fit mediums better these days. The shirts I bought last year are holding up well. A little pilling on one of them but the rest are good, especially the ripstop version I bought."
2,wrong size sent,The shirts are fantastic. I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great. My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent. I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x. Not a big deal but I didn't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it. The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it. It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue.
5,My husband wears Dickie's only,"My husband works in the IT field, so perhaps it is unusual that his chooses what is commonly viewed as a ""Work Shirt"". I mean how rough does it get tapping all those keys? We have both found that these shirts fit well, don't lose their shape and last. No fading or rips and the pockets hold strong. What started out as an experiment turned into buying them exclusively."
5,I like the shirts.,the shirts fit fine. i was dismayed to see that Dickies products are no longer made in this country. i can still remember the union label and made in USA on the label.
1,"Good book, terrible edition","Although the original Evans-Wentz book is a good resource, the number of typographical errors in this edition renders it unreadable and in some areas useless. It looks like the text was copied using computer Optical Character Recognition software and the total edit check was a computer spell checker, so whole words of the text have been changed."
1,The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countires NuVision publisher,This is one of the worst versions of W.Y. Evans-Wentz works. This book is also an insult to the original version. Nearly every page is rife with typos making it difficult to read. Apparently this company either does not have an qualified editors or they fell asleep on the job before they even started.I would take my money elsewhere and try to find an earlier version if you can.
4,Good resume advice,"This book provides good resume templates. I then used the ""Vault Reports Guide to America's Top 50 Law Firms"" to send resumes to law firm hiring managers and to prepare for my interviews."
5,Totally Cool,This book is a skating book about Lauren and her friends.It's deffinatly a must have for skating fans!!!
4,Breakfast In DC,"The first single from TWENTYFIRSTCENTURYSKIN, Praga lashes out more of his ingenious melodies with the help of his trusty (and gorgeous) Nord Lead 2 and long time collaborator Oliver Adams (the drum man). This single deserved very much to be the first from the album, the song is perfect for every party and would rake in big sweat at any club. Hopefully, Mr. Englen won't be so underground in the US for long. This is possibly one of his best singles. The album is a timeless piece of work which I love and listen to nearly every day."
4,VHS flaw,"The product arrived in a timely manner. It was formerly a circulating library item. The video is mostly in good shape - there was one glitch, as is expected with used VHS tapes... Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase."
5,Daddy Long Legs,"Very enjoyable movie Mary was at her best, and always makes me laugh.The movie was in realy good condition.I would incourage every one to see."
5,What a Charming whimsical movie. One of pickfords best,This has to be about my Favorite Pickford film. It stands the test of time. It shows the full gammut of emotions from slap stick comedy to heart felt tragedy. From her as the Child with nothing who had spunk and courage to her blossoming into a beautiful women and her mentor falling in love with her which concluded to the ultimate happy ending.This is a must for all Pickford fans. it is sweet with out being overly so. it is a true fantasy that all will love.A most Charming movie. A classic for all time!
4,"Bearing An Hourglass (Incarnations of Immortality, Book 2)","I usually do not care for a series that changes main characters, but the Piers Anthony seemed to do a good job. After a slow start the book became engaging enough to keep me interested and progressed to a very satisfying conclusion. The book would have been 5 stars, but the subject (TIME) was a bit difficult to explain easily and slowed everything down.Even with that difficulty I would recommend the First book and this one to others for an interesting take on life, death, time and the other Incarnations."
3,A book of Temporal Mechanics about Time himself,This is an outstanding book it you care for in depth detail on the workings of time and the period in which you live your life backwards. It is a metally stimulating book. It ranged form having a romantic aspect with emotion to the nitty gritty of the inner workings of the thought of time. A good read if you like this kind of thing.
2,A tremendous comedown. . .,". . .from the first ""Incarnations of Immortality"" novel.""Bearing an Hourglass"" deals with the character of Time. While the introductory couple of chapters set the stage rather well, the remainder of the novel fails in its promise. Norton, in his role as Chronos, traveling backward and forward through time, encounters numerous attempts to dissuade him in his purpose -- to fight against Satan and the forces of evil.However, the ""encounters"" don't seem realistic (even for a fantasy novel). The freshness of the first novel is almost totally absent, as is the depth of character development.When I first read this volume some 8-10 years ago, I found it one of the weaker efforts of the series. A recent re-reading has not disabused me of this notion.Worth a read as part of the series -- but standing alone, it is a grave disappointment."
4,"I liked this in the 80's, and I like it now!","Piers Anthony is dated and a bit sexist, but I enjoy the story. The whole concept is interesting, and I like the thought processes he inspires."
4,Excellent,This was the book that I was most engrossed in. I don't see why people thought this was confusing. I followed- and enjoyed it-and Im only 13!
5,Uh-oh... Time Paradox!,"Out of all the Incarnations, the office of Time seems to be the most baffling one, since Chronos has to live backwards in time. But having power over spacetime (and being able to travel anywhere within) seems to be a more than adequate compensation for having to live backward and seeing everyone move forward. It seems that Mr. Anthony had a LOT of fun writing this book, playing around with the ideas of paradox, time travel, alternate realities, terrene and contraterrene worlds, space travel, and the like. It gets especially heady towards the end, such as the conversation between Chronos and Bemme, or Chronos traveling to the end of time and back and his realization/understanding of time and Satan's lies.Overall a solid book with a lot of philosophical/scientific ideas with more seriousness than 'On a Pale Horse', this book is definitely one of the better in the series. Two thumbs up!"
4,Good reading...,This is the second book in the series I have read and enjoyed it. On a pale horse was the first and a better book. The story line is interesting although it gets gimmicky at points....
2,"Some good ideas, but terrible writing","There were some interesting ideas in this book and in the first one, but Piers Anthony is, quite simply, a painfully bad writer. He writes like an early teenager in almost every way - redundant, self-indulgent, and shallow. The sad thing for these books is that, unlike the Xanth series, there is actually a decent story at their core. Even a mildly competent editor could have turned this series into a decent work of fantasy. Instead it's just a monument to a missed opportunity."
3,Great Series/Weakest Book,"I love Piers Anthony's writing. This is the series I started out with, when first exploring his talents. While the series itself is fasinating and thought provoking, this book was the least of the seven. It seemed to have less focus than the usual great story by Mr. Anthony. It wasn't a bad book, just not as good as the others. However, I reccommend reading it, along with the other 6 in order. Everything comes together in the end in this series."
4,Imagine living tomorrow before you live today ...,"Piers Anthony does it again! The whole 'Incarnations of Immortality' series, deals with concepts that have confounded philosophers for millinieums, but is served across in very palatable fantasy. This book deals with the almightly metaphysical question of TIME. The confusion a mere mortal has to face when he takes up the 'office' of Time (sort of like taking up the office of a President) and become the mighty Chronos who wields the hourglass, is hilarious"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Surrogate ghost parent stint fails, becomes Lord of Time instead.This Incarnation gets to do the Merlin thing, and live backwards in time. Being in charge of that he can go forward if he wants to, though.He hooks up with one of the Fates, and also has Satan try and trick him, one of these stunts includes trying to convince him to stop the event that makes the guy in the first book Thanatos."
3,Weakest book in a great series,"As usual, nice characters, fun plots, unusual ideas (as well as the normal easily-tuned-out preachiness). But, this one wanders too much (irrelevant adventures here and there) and also seems to get time confused."
2,Not A Great Follow Up,"In the firstbook of this seires there is only one chapter is about the maine charicter's life wich gives you the a good understanding of the charicter before he becomes an incarnation. But in this book nearly half the book is about norton's life and relationships and stuff that you don't care about. When he finally does get offered the position of the incarnation of Time it hardly explains the porpse of his office, his day to day duty as an incarnation it is just him playing with his powers. On anouther note the author wastes three chapters on side storys that have nothing to do with the the maine story, for instance satan will send him away on an adventure far away were he will inconter a damsle in distress an have an adventure with her then at the end of the chapter he will come home and the regulare story will resume, This happens 3 TIMES!! but it is usefull to read this book to fully understand the other great novles."
3,"Interesting, but flawed.","Piers anthony is a great talent. But he seems to write mostly for the money (he even admits this fact, as far as I can remember). The result is, many of his books have very interesting ideas, yet poor (sometimes even pathetic) character development and a story line which doesn't make sense at time. Not to mention the chapters added only to ""fill the quota"". This book is a good example. It tells the tale of the reincarnation of Time - a person which got the job of being in charge of time. The ideas he uses are really original and fascinating - but some parts are just plain stupid! Either way, it's worth the read - if you have the patience (and nothing better to read)."
4,Lets take a walk with (not through) Time,"Imagine having your life going one direction a minute ago then having it going the other in an instant. I'm not meaning the emotional roller coaster we live through I mean literally changing directions, through time. Sounds wild, right? Well Piers Anthony makes it possible in this addition to the Incarnations series. It might sound confusing at first but if you like paradox (and Chronos loves paradox) then you will like this novel. With its switchbacks, backward language, and interesting plot lines, its a go getter. If you find it confusing try to finish it out, this book links alot of the other novels in the series together. Have fun."
5,Book for all ages,"This book and the one's that accompany it in the series are great for adults and young adults as well. It lets the reader experience a different point of view on the principles of morality and mortality as well. I started reading this series in highschool, when I was rumaging through the library. One of the teachers literally through the first book, On a pale horse, at me and was hooked ever since. So Hooray for Piers Anthony and his genius mastery of the literary craft."
5,Bren Gun Saga,I would claasify this book as indispensable to anyone contimplating either buying or building a Bren Gun. This book is the most complete collection of facts on this fine historical firearm.
3,"music ok, sound is better","Don't let my thoughts on the music drive you away from trying some (other) Claire Martin album -- she has a great, sultry, smoky voice reminiscent of Dusty Springfield. In fact, it was hearing Riverman on NPR that got me to buy this, as that tune reminds me of Dusty's ""Look of Love"" from Casino Royale. As for the rest of the album, it strikes me as a nice, if uninvolving, pastiche of styles made famous by Petula Clark and others that I can best describe as... very... British (which is not a disparagement, just a description).(edited from original): I have decided that my pre-amp was to blame for my former dislike of the sonics on this album, and not the album itself. This Linn disc is actually really good sonically, but I will say that on less-than-great equipment might sound dull -- the cymbal brushes are subtle, as are the rest of the percussive sounds. On my messed up old system, nothing sparkled unless it had an 'agressive' sound, which this does not."
3,For the completist only,"My favorite female jazz singer went a little off-track here. Thank God she returned to jazz soon after releasing this recording. This is not an album to buy as your first Claire Martin experience (that would be the ""Linn Box"") because it is not the Claire Martin that exists on any other recording. Still, it's not a bad album and it's worth listening. If you're a Martin fanatic (as I am), it's worth buying.Why her recordings are not any more readily available in the USA is a mystery to me. You can obtain her most recent online at www.linn.co.uk, however. If you love her music, I recommend you do this."
5,Deceptively large!,"A great spoon which is significantly larger than pictured. It's design and quality will make it last a lifetime, and it's heavy. If you're looking for an all-around utility spoon, this is the best I've found over the years. Its bowl is 2.25-inches wide by 3.5-inches long. I love it."
3,Is this a fuel filter?,"The fram C1191A' s on my engines are FUEL. filters, not air filters. So if I order these here, will I get the correct part?"
3,"Pretty, but inside liner is weak","I have a 2 months old baby and I haven't have too many trips outside the house, but the inside of the bag is already tearing. It should not do so so early, I do not think it will last long enough for my second child. Otherwise, the bag is pretty and has enough room and pockets for all your necessities ."
1,missywebber,I have a five month old and ever since she was about 2 months old the inside of the bag has been ripping out. It was so bad that I had to buy a new diaper bag.
3,Disappointed,"I bought this diaper bag because it was so roomy and so cute. I love Winnie the Pooh! This was a great diaper bag for when my daughter was a newborn and I had to pack all those diapers, bottles, formula and extra clothing. Now that my daughter is 14 months old, I find that it's too big. Also, the plastic liner inside the bag ripped after about 7 months, and is now completely destroyed. I just bought the Catini Colorado Midi Tote and it's the perfect size. Bottom line: Great for short term use or long trips, wouldn't recommend it because of the plastic lining."
4,Great Diaper Bag,"This diaper bag is fabulous. It is not only cute, but is holding up very well. I received it for a shower gift, and I am so happy with it. It has more than enough room for everthing that I need to carry and it looks great on my shoulder or dad's :)I love this bag!!"
3,Good space but not stardy,"I had one from baby shower, I used it twice a week for about 3 months. Outside was really nice and look stronger but then the inside lining torned apart after few use. It's the price you pay. I'm still using it once in awhile because it still look new from outside.Soho"
5,"Great product, doesn't cost a fortune (rare for baby stuff)","We bought this diaper bag for my daughter, who is now 2. I have to admit, it was the price that first attracted us, as I just could not see spending $40 or more on a diaper bag. But we also liked the pretty pattern and soft colors. My daughter was even content to just stare at it when she was a newborn. I have never had any problems. It has been very durable and is still in great shape even after 2 years. I have even thrown it in the washing machine a few times on the gentle cycle, which I was a little apprehensive about at first, but thankfully it held up. Lots of room and lots of pockets for all those little things newborns require, but also works great for toddlers. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,An Ok Diaper Bag,I received this diaper bag as a shower gift. I ended up using it as a toy bag for all the toys she received at the showers. It is sturdy enough for that. It does not look like it is sturdy enough for a lot of wear and tear.
3,love the bag but does not last long,I love this i think it is the cutest bag ever. But the liner in the bag is coming apart. The outside still looks good but the inside is all torn up. I use this bag for my daughters school daycare bag. So it is very strong. I recommend this bag just for outtings. Not for everyday us.
3,disapointed,i bought the diaperbag when i was like 7 months along waiting for the rest of the bedding to come out and it never did....any way the zipper broke and it ripped on the inside and you can see foam was so disapointed i got a newe diaper bag in 3 months
1,Do NOT buy this diaper bag,"On the outside, this diaper bag is really cute so i put it on my baby shower registry. I wish I would have read some of the earlier reviews before I picked it because now I'm kicking myself for getting it. My daughter is only 2 months old and I already had to buy a new diaper bag. I never threw it in the washing machine and the inside plastic lining already ripped. I'm not talking about a little rip, I mean the whole inside tore out. I wasn't even rough with it, I take care of my things since I'm a young mother without a lot of extra money to waste. I never expected to have to buy a new bag already! Definitely do NOT buy this bag if you want a durable, quality product!"
3,Is alright.,"I wanted this bag because I thought the baby Pooh was so cute. The storage is great, there's a lot of room for all the diapers, bottles, baby needs, etc. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is that the inner lining is already starting to come apart and I've only had the bag for 2 months. I wouldn't recommend this bag if you plan on using it on a daily basis."
4,I love this bag,"I've had my bag for 4 months now and i used it 2 months before my baby was born and now for 2 months now that she's here, ive NEVER had a problem with this bag, no ripping or anything, i might have got lucky and got a bag that was made well....but i think this bag is a must, great on storage, more room then you'll ever need...."
4,Pastel step by step,"This is a useful step by step book. When I first read it, I don't like it. But when I read it again , I think this book is pretty helpful. Good for beginners."
4,"8'0"" MH","The only thing I don't like about the rod is it doesn't fit in my Berkley Spiral Rod Holder. It is very easy to see at night, has plenty of backbone, and the LEDs' are a bonus. It's a real nice rod overall."
3,berkleyrod,"Berkley Glowstik 2 Piece Spinning Rod (8'0"", Medium-Heavy, 10-25 lbs)I was wondering if this rod light's up with batteries that would be great im looking for something not that glow's in the dark up light's up from a source. I live in Mn so catfishing and walleye fishing is a huge thing around here for fisherman's if you can write back that would be awesome thank's"
3,OK,Product was new. Wall charger was european. Had to buy a new one. Phone is unable to receive picture msges. Not sure if that is a flaw in the phone or what. Other than that the phone is great.
1,Slowest phone in the world :(,"If you are a text-message fan, do not buy it... it is really slow, the menu, the text editor... eveything, I sold it to someone else... I did not like it..."
2,Just Ok....,"I like the look of, but reception is bad most of the time.... My old cheap Nokia has a way better reception wherever I am...But the battery life is the best I ever had. I guess is good where you have a strong signal, otherwise is a problem."
1,Worst phone I have ever owned,"This phone is probably the worst I have ever owned. I cannot wait to get a new one, because this one is so bad. First of all. There is no screen on the front which is just annoying because you can't see who is calling you or what time it is until you flip the thing open. I get horrible reception everywhere I go, and zero reception in a lot of places. The phone I had before was fine in those same areas. There is no predictive text for text messaging which makes sending a short message a tedious chore. The back cover falls off everyday. Over all it looks nice, but when you get down to it, its just not practical considering all the other phones out there. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
1,Worst Phone Ever!,"Worst! Worst! Worst! I wouldn't buy this phone for a toddler if I had to... I'm serious! It's reeeeeaaaally slow, sluggish, less than a half MB of available memory, the volume goes and comes, has to charge every day, if it goes off for whatever reason, then it's hells to get it back on at times, I'll type a text message then have to wait and watch the letters come up one by one seconds after like an old typewriter... and I can go on but I wont. I am not trying to pull down the phone, but I really can't find any whistles to lend it. It's really horrible. Buy at your own risk, but if you should ever ask my opinion, I'll tell you plainly- NO! Oh, there is one pro (lol)--> the design is not bad, cute. Lol."
1,very poor quality,"Poorly made, the seller never mentioned that the key pad was written in Indian or Farsi..."
1,NOT QUAD BAND,"Product in perfect condition, but not a quad band as described when i bougth it, I need the phone to use it in another country and didnt work, very unsatisfied and can't returned because i'm not at the US."
2,Crap,"keeps resetting itself, turns off, deletes all of my numbers and pics. won't access the att internet. can only call people and no texting. NO BLUETOOTHthe pros: Good battery, and a stylish design"
4,great phone for the price,i bought this cell for my mom as she said she wanted a simple phone.. this phone does the job its nothing fancy but it works. i would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a replacement phone. i only rated it 4 stars because it does not have bluetooth.
3,Good effect for little kids.,"I mostly bought this trick to see how it works and for a good ""on the go"" trick. I was surprised at how well it worked. People with a sharp eye will probably find out how it works but little kids will enjoy the fact that they just saw a penny turn into a dime!"
3,Just the highlights...,A little dissappointed that it is just the highlights. I was expecting to hear all of the songs in this wonderful musical.
4,Review,I am not usually a fan of musicals but this is one of the best and having the original cast is a plus.
3,Woodline is rather economical line,"These are typical economical router bits. For such price, no bit in the World can be really good. However, I found trick to make them better. I order these bits and send them immediately (without use) for sharpening to Ridge Carbide. Initially, they will be as good as Whiteside or Amana, but they dull somewhat quicker.However, these bits are as balanced as top line bits. Nevertheless, for demanding routing such as raised panel, joinery and dovetails, I do buy Amana."
5,First and maybe last set I'll need,"Three years and many projects later, I've used most of these and they continue to work like new with a heavy duty router. I was a bit worried that these would be too cheap and need to be replaced, but the set is a great value. As an amateur I've shaved more wood than I should have. Someday I'll need a raised panel bit, but otherwise these do everything."
4,Intruiging,"This story is sound, the action is never sacrificed at the expense of the political commentary, and the commentary makes lots of sense. I like."
1,Libertarian or Libertine?,"In many ways this is a good SF story with a libertarian utopian society. The author pokes fun at himself and the utopia when one character says it is not a utopia, there are man-eating animals way out in the woods. OK, so it is not a utopia. And the utopia is more of a sexual fantasy than a political ideal. Some of the politics of the tiny ""government"" are not clear; there seems to be some sort of democratic influence on the placement of roads. There seem to be some good libertarian ideas and some good commentary on priorities, but most of that is lost in the noise. Eventually I realized this book was more libertine than libertarian, more about license than liberty; I stopped at a little past a third in and put the book down.You should note that this review is written by somebody who did not read to the end and so did not see any redeeming features near the end. Completely unfair, I know. The tiny gems I did see did not tip the scale enough to get out of one star."
5,"Freehold rocks!!! Read the book, now I want to move there!","I read Michael Z. Williamson's The Weapon before I read Freehold. Both take place in the same time and world with some of the same characters but Freehold was published before The Weapon. The Weapon isn't what I'd consider a direct sequel so reading the newer novel first didn't ruin reading Freehold for me. Both these novels are incredible and I haven't enjoyed any sci-fi novels this much in the last 10 years. This guy writes sci-fi like the masters I grew up reading and devouring every new novel they'd come out with. The likes of Heinlien, Asimov and Clarke with a kind of edge reminiscent of Harlan Ellison. I just got his newest novel, Better to Beg Forgiveness which just came out in hardcover and I'm psyched up now. Can't recommend these books highly enough. If you liked Starship Troopers by Heinlien or The Forever War by Haldeman then you'll love Freehold and The Weapon."
3,Not remastered at all.,"This DVD looks like a vhs rip, so a/v is bad quality. Film is low budget but still fine if that's your style."
2,Does not argue his points well,I cannot pretend that this book isn't popular or prize winning. I don't dislike it because I don't agree with him; I found some of his arguments very intriguing and it has a lot of good history. I read this cover to cover and was thoroughly disappointed with his specious reasoning and unexpectedly poor analysis.
3,Use with Caution,"As a student (and now a professor) of the American Revolution and the Early Republic, I had read this book not long after it was published and, more recently, used it as the cornerstone for an upper division undergraduate course on the American Revolution.I believe this book has both strengths and weaknesses. Wood examines pre-Revolutionary society in stunning detail, but I believe that he also stretches some of his points, particularly the before-then-after conclusions that he makes.I used this book as the cornerstone for my course because it was highly controversial. I balanced Wood's analysis with works by scholars who did, or might, disagree with his premises. Therefore, I recommend this book, but I recommend that it be read cautiously, with skepticism, and that the reading is balanced by the words and works of other scholars of this era."
5,An essential work for understanding the American Revolution,Wood argues that the American Revolution was essentially a revolution in prosperity. The revolution spurred the penetration of networks of commerce deep among the population. The traditional ties of monarchical patronage and dependence were severed. A new egalitarian society was born
5,Great Show - Why Didn't it Last?,"This show is soooo good! I realize I am probably in the minority when I admit I bought this show BECAUSE Stephanie March from Law & Order SVU is one of the stars. There is no explanation of why she is back as Cabot, but I am able to ignore that and just watch the show. There is a lot of humor and a ton of good drama. Each character is explored and endearing to you by the last show. I really REALLY wish this show wouldve gone on for more seasons."
5,Breaking the silence like bread...,"Richard Tagett, native of Ohio, resident of San Francisco, born in 1935, inspired by Don Allen's ""New American Poetry,"" one-time disciple of Jack Spicer, student of Robert Duncan, Russian River acid poet renegade with Hunce Voelker and Andrei Codrescu, partner of magical realist painter Jose Lafitte, co-editor of MANROOT magazine in the 70s, existentialist-hermit in the 80s and early 90s....here with his very first book. And about time! The poems are part of his 'selected poems'series--although their arrangement in the book are not chronological. Tagett's epistles to those alive as flesh and ghost abound with a healthy suspicion of language's ability to fully and truly express experience (""(...) the words""). In a poetry world full of cliques and trends, Tagett's work and poetic self stands on its own. I look forward to the next installment.www.diogenessf.blogspot.com"
5,The Dashing Mr. Dively,"Since computers seem to be the wave of the future I decided to get my certification. I bought Mr. Dively's book hoping to study and pass my CCNA. The book is well written, but it did not help me pass the test. In retrospect, it might have helped. If you get 1/10th of the pleasure out of it that I do then it is well worth the price."
2,"a lot of hard questions, not enough explanation","The book does not go indepth into a lot of physics problems. It will solve one question on one topic and then give the student a bunch of other questions at the end of the chapter that are different and harder than the solved example problems. Everyone who has taken college physics knows that there are a lot of variations to different questions, and there are conditions and exceptions that must be taken into account before a problem is solved. If you have a crappy physics professor, like I had, this book will make physics a nightmare for you."
3,Fair at best,"This book is too bulky and too wordy. The authors purport to bend over backwards to guide the student through some difficult subject matter, but they end up making it more confusing. And then there are the corny jokes. Who has time for this nonsense? Were it not for the very good illustrations, I would give this a lower rating. My advice: Go to the lecture, do the problems but don't waste time reading this textbook."
2,not enough examples!,"like other physics books, this one fails to provide sufficient examples for various problems. Many times this book will provide 1 or 2 examples on some concept and then expect you to solve problems that are substantially different than the examples."
3,"Big in size, not on useful content","This textbook is undeniably heavy and bulky. You do not want to carry this thing on your back for the whole days. It has almost 2000 pages! The content is okay, but I recommend a supplementary text (not the study guide, its horrible). I find that these new textbooks are just crammed with too much information you don't use or don't need. Cut to the real stuff, already!"
1,Never received the book,"I need to cancel this order, because I never received this book as of 12/08/2010. The order was in on 11/2/2010."
5,Great for oily skin!,This product is fantastic! It didn't make me break out. I used far less oil sheets during the day and really noticed a difference! It lasts awhile and is reasonably priced. Excellent!
3,Helps My Very Oily Skin,"I have VERY oily skin. I can easily fill one of the Clean & Clear oil removing sheets about every 4 hours. My whole face is a ""problem area,"" so I apply this product all over before applying powder foundation. This is the first mattifier I've tried, and while it works okay, I definitely still have to carry around oil removing sheets.PROS- After applying, my face does look beautifully matte. This is especially great during humid weather when my skin seems to constantly be shiny. This might be enough for some people if your skin is not as oily as mine.- The tube is big enough to last you at least several months, if not longer.CONS-This product only helps out my skin for the first 3 hours or so. After that, I'm back on my schedule of using the oil removing sheets."
3,Oily skin,"Doesn't soak up the oil for long, but I have extremely oily skin. This will work great for moderately oily skin."
4,Oil Mattifier,I like this product a lot. It is much better than the Mary Kay Oil Control Lotion. Using this product will provide a powdered /no shine result especially if you blot before applying. It allowed me to go from blotting 10-12 times a day to 4-5 times instead. For someone with really oily skin this product will help reduce shine for the whole day - especially if you re-apply mid-day. After about 6-8 months of daily use i found it wasn't as effective so a user may need to take a 1-2 month break then continue use to maintain the same level of effectiveness.
4,Seems to work pretty good,"I have such an oil slick of a face, but anything that can help is good! I used this in addition to primer, foundation & powder and it really looks great. The tube was bigger than I was expecting and it really doesn't take much at all so it will most likely last a long time. For the price I will keep coming back!"
4,"Works, Reasonably Priced","I dab this on areas on my cheeks where my pores are too large. It definitely makes them appear smaller while not being too drying. Also, the consistency is light and did not clog my pores. I like to put it over my foundation, rather than on bare skin and that works best for me. Very inexpensive compared to similar type dept store products available. I repurchased a second tube. First lasted quite a while. Really no downside."
1,Political Commentary,"Maybe this item should be retitled as ""Crude: My Opinions"" because it is certainly not any type of credible story of the petroleum industry. Don't read this book if you are looking for explanation of the industry. This book has value only as an opinion piece relating politics and oil."
2,Not good...,"There were so many things which were disappointing about this game, it's hard to know where to start. For beginners, the camera made me nauseous and much of the time you couldn't see where you were going. The graphics were sub-par, with big chunks of the world like sidewalks and walls flickering on and off. The motions of the riders looks really stiff and unnatural. The control is wonky, and doesn't feel like you're riding a bike. For example he speeds up without pedaling! Also the number of tricks pales in comparison to Mirra BMX and Tony Hawk.All in all, a big disappointment."
2,not even half of dave mirra,"Its too bad this game is as bad as it is. I would have loved it if it were a clone of Dave Mirras BMX, but its not. This came out after Dave Mirras BMX and it should have been better. This game suffers a great deal with clipping (textures and walls become see through), the gameplay is slow, and the control is hard to manuver. When you turn, it turn more and further than you want it to go. The camera is very choppy and does not help you see what is in front of you. The animation is very stiff and unrealistic, even for a game. save your money and dont buy it. I love BMX and have been waiting for BMX games since Excitebike and I guess there always has to be a few games that come out only to get a quick buck, this is one of them."
2,this game bites,"this game is terrible, it's not even worth the money to rent it. Tony Hawk 2 is SOOOOOOOOOO much better. Even the MAtt Hofman demo in Tony hawk 2 is 10,000 times better. this game is awful, if you really want to get a BMX game, get Dave Mirra, and even that isn't that great of a game. the only reason i gave this game 2 stars, is because only games like that star the olsen twins deserver 1 star."
2,Essentially a fluffed-up doctoral dissertation,"Redcoats is a book for the historian or academician but not the general reader. Brumwell has one point to make, more or less, that the English soldier in North America adapted to the style of fighting needed during the French-Indian War and was effective. This does not require an entire book and does not make for an interesting one. Every page contains several footnotes which usually don't explain anything further and could better be placed at the end. I had to work to finish the book. But possibly I'm being unfair in that I was looking for a book to build on my understanding of the war and not such an esoteric treatment of one part of it."
3,Pretty good; but he's done better,"I snatched this book up as soon as I saw it. I have three other of Roger Jennings' database books and they are great.This one was a little disappointing. It has good information in it and it is informative. But, percentage-wise at least, it seems to contain a lot more filler, like unneeded code. The style of writing seems so different from his other books that I wonder how much of the actual writing Mr. Jennings did himself.It's definitely not a bad book. Overall it was worth the money. Maybe the second edition will add more substance. I would actually rate it at 3 1/2 stars, but that's not an available option."
4,Not perfect but a lot better then a lot of the others,This book does a better job of explaining what happens behind the vs2005 data object wizzards then many of the other books that just show you how to use them.
1,Not Very Useful,"I bought this book when I was learning Visual Basic .Net and ADO.NET. I needed to do a standard business database application, and I kept going to the book for details on how do do things, and on an overall understanding of ADO.NET. But I rarely got any answers.There may be some people who find this book helpful, but I am not one of them."
1,Rip Off,The kindle version is only approx 3 dollars cheaper than the hard back with probably 1/2 to cost to produce they are ripping you off if you buy this. Don't purchase this or any other book where they are doing this check the hard back price first. Let them hear your dissatifaction with your money. Check it before you buy!!!
2,Conversions,"I love the bakery and I love a good challenge. What I don't love is the suggestion that we use fresh yeast to the point where all of the recipes calibrated for the use of fresh yeast, without providing conversions to dry yeast in each recipe. The conversion appears at the beginning, and is cumbersome. It puts me off trying the bread recipes when I don't happen to have fresh yeast at hand (n.b. this is most of the time) and when I don't have a pencil and paper to do some arithmetic. The one time we did buy fresh yeast, it had gone bad before we could use it. This is not a particularly practical cookbook, but rather a celebration of the bakery, and a good read if you've always wanted to know how much work it takes to make a pain au chocolat."
4,A forgotten classic,"I really liked this album. It was a hit in 1976 when it was released, hitting number 11 on the Billboard album charts and becoming another in a long string of million sellers for America. It includes the top 20 hit Today's The Day and the minor hit Amber Cascades. Other songs received some airplay like Jet Boy Blue (this song should have been released as a single), Letter, and Watership Down. George Martin must have had a ball producing this album as he makes heavy use of strings and horns, but it is done very well. A very good album."
5,excellent safety skills taught,"A great book for teaching kids general safety rules, how to avoid predators, and wise planning."
5,Careless Love,A drama for 1 male and 1 female. An up and coming actor and a dancer struggle through their problems of career and commitment and the birth of a child.
4,Underrated recording,"Little known, yet great Miles recording. Highlights are the first track, ""Come and Get It"" and the performances of a few key personnel, particularly guitarist Mike Stern and bassist Marcus Miller. If you're a fan of these guys, the first track alone is worth the price of the CD. The bluesy ""It Gets Better"" features fabulous solos by both Miles and Stern also. If you're a fan of later Miles recordings such as ""The Man With the Horn"" and ""Decoy,"" this CD is probably one you'll want."
3,"Possibly the best of Miles' last ""comeback""","This is oddly unavailable on CD in the US (Columbia/Sony: why?) but is, possibly, the consistently strongest effort of Miles' last ""comeback"". Driven by guitarists, blues/funk inspired, and there's no Cyndy Lauper or Michael Jackson pop filler. Some arranging is by Gil Evans, some by Marcus Miller, stretching his wings as Miles' music director. Scofield's phrasing is so far behind the beat it's like he's mailing it in. Lotsa fun, if not the earthshaking mind-boggling music Miles made in the 60's and 70's."
3,BAD MILES,"NOT ONE OF HIS BETTER ALBUMS.. WEAK PLAYING ON HIS SOLO, MAYBE DUE TO HIS ILLNESS AT THE TIME. MORE FOR COLLECTORS COLLECTION AND NOT FOR JUST LISTENINGS.."
2,Not as new as I had hoped,The book got to me in a timely manner but it was not as new as I had hoped. It was definitely a used book. It had a little more under lining from previous use than was given in the description by the previous owner.
4,Classic Spawn revisted,"I still read comics, and Spawn was the new big thing, peaking in 1997 with a Hollywood movie. However, I lost most of my comic humor with Spawn out of fear of being labeled racist, with the lead character being of African American ancestry, there were a number of racist currents and still are as the Spawn book continues today. His costume is cool- that's the thing- if Spawn were nota black guy much as is the case with DC's Steel character, it would just scream white supremacist all over it. I am not judging the Spawn comics by his skin color, in fact the exact opposite- I will warn you this contains a number of highly racist themes much like The Sandman. Collects Spawn like issues 21 to 26 or something. :)"
2,INTERESTING CONCEPT,"Two teen girls are blind orphans by day. At night they regain their eye sight for hunting. They are apparently frequently killed and part of the film is flashbacks to previous lives, the first of which was extremely boring with no dialouge, just music. They are adopted by a rich elderly doctor.The girls wear Catholic girl outfits, frolic in the graveyard, and even partake in dog's blood. In one scene they dare each other to stand naked outside their adopted father's window. They believe they were once ancient Aztec/Inca goddesses. The dialouge is culturally odd in the translation as the girls are described as ""so sweet, so pure, just like the sisters of baby Jesus."" Another bit was ""all gods are real because they are imaginary.""The movie was artsy and not a real horror style vampire film. As an art film, I failed to grasp the message.Lame sound track. No f-bombs, no sex, some nudity. Neither erotic or scarey."
2,To boring to finish,"Two Orphan VampiresI have seen a lot of vampire movies lately, and this is the worst!There is no excuse in this day in age for grainy, out of focus photography,but this movie has it! The dialog was inane drivel, the acting wasawful and the lighting was bad. I only gave two stars because theactresses were cute -though boredom quickly over-rides that small plus.Instead, if you need an injection of good vampire movies I really enjoyed,I recommend-""Vampire Party"" ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" ""Let The Right One In""""The Vampires Assistant"" and ""The Killer Clowns From Outer Space"""
1,Totally disappointed.,"My name is Sergio Burlamaqui and I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a Bill Bruford's big fan but I have to confess that I am totally disappointed with the DVD.Poor quality image, shaking shots, poor sound quality, people appearing in front of the camera, it looks like a not professional video (amateur). The DVD image sometimes looks like an AVI computer file encoded with DivX codec with pixeling. I think the digital process of put the original video to the DVD format didn't work here.I can't imagine how Bill Bruford can launch a product like that.If you are going to buy the DVD, try to watch it first!"
5,Deftly outlines assimilation lessons of the past,"America has long been known for racial diversity, yet as waves of immigrants continue to arrive, many wonder if that diversity has been overwhelmed by differences. Political historian Michael Barone says that the new Americans can be interwoven into American life as easily as they have in the past - and in New Americans he deftly outlines assimilation lessons of the past which can be applied to modern times."
1,"tendentious, glib, reductive","How does Mr. Barone argue that the modern immigration situation is just a rerun of the situation 100 years ago, and likely to be as auspicious?Simple: He exagerrates their similarities and ignores their differences (race, racial consciousness) and historical inconsistencies between the two time periods (multiculturalist ideology: prevalent now, unheard of then). He draws authority from second-hand sources from his own political circles with whom he shares political agendas (Tamar Jacoby, John Jay(!) Miller). This is a sectarian and amateurish mixture of wishfull thinking and ..."
2,This was a hard deal due to Amazon policy,"After I purchased this hat the shippment date was 3-weeks so I tried to cancel it. Amazon's policy of not becoming involved, and the fact that the seller's cancellation email is not functional started a very hard process. It took two weeks to cancel. This makes me think twice about buying major purchases from Amazon."
4,nice compliment to Goad,"If you like PHil Hales work this is a must have. Nice collection of his paintings and collages, and compliments his other art book GOAD really well. Only reason i am giving it 4 stars is that there is no Johnny Bad hair paintings as he is not a part of this series but also that his art IMO is getting a bit too loose and abstract. I still love what he does but sometimes he goes in a direction that i am not as fond of, like when a face is just a big blob of paint, next to a rendered body. And there is a lot of repetition to the paintings but i have realized that is his style and PHil is about muscles and torsos so i have grown to appreciate what he wants to paint and enjoy looking at his process and visual voice.My recommendation track down a copy. you won't be disappointed."
5,Style Council was Weller's Artistic Peak !,"Weller's sheer brilliance and talent at fusing classical,jazz,funk, pop, with such finesse is a testament that the late 20th Century did produce some of the finest musical composers and writers, performers of the pop genre ! Listen to the doo-wop teaser at the end that concludes this project; imagine doo-wop in the late 80's! Lyrically speaking, the track The Story Of Someone's Shoe has some erotically charged lyrics about a one night stand. Yet, they are written in such a way that it's sheer poetic and descriptive wit without making it sound like filth! Weller also wrote about the political turmoil(Thatcherism-Reagan era) and various global issues of the time with candor and lyrical vitality ! However, listeners were so captivated by the ""grooviness"" of the music produced that sometimes the meaning and lyrics of the songs would go over their heads...Yes, I was very fortunate to pick up an inexpensive used copy of this rare recording!"
3,"Half Great,Half Curious","This is not the Style council's most consistant album,even by their standards.The first half is dominated by catchysoulful dance tunes like ""Iwasadoledadstoyboy"",""How She ThrewIt All Away"" and ""Life At A Top People's Health Farm"".But thatand the epic nine-mintute tital track feature bitter lyrics andeven a toilet flush-it's clear Weller has lost interest.One starmust be omitted for the deadly dull ""classical/doo-wop"" medleyon the second half's ""piano paintings"",a clear piece of self-indulgent drivel.Too bad-this could have been excecuted better."
4,Batteries not included,"Being an active person, music is a very important part of my life. If you are looking for a decent mp3 player, the philips jordan mp3 player is a safe bet.One of the quirks i do have about this player is that the rechargeable battery that is included has a life of about 10 minutes. Well not really, but you would apparently think so after using it.A plus side to this mp3 player is that you can also save word files on this player. Not too bad for the active man on the go.The equalizer buttons are a bit tough to press at first, but i am sure that this will get better as the mp3 player gets worn in.All in all i believe this to be a quality product and you get what you pay for with this product."
5,Taps for Private Tussie,"This book was the winner of the 1943 Thomas Jefferson Award and the illustrator is THE Thomas Benton, the famous mural painter from Missouri.This book is a literary classic in that it can be read on so many diverse planes of enjoyment by so many different kinds of people. It is folk-poetry sensuous and hilarious fun, but also lots of eager page turning to see what is the world can be going to happen next.Everyone who reads this book will enjoy it."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I've been a Stevie fan for over 25 years, Stevie Nicks being my all time female vocalist. This video is made up mostly of lip sync which was really disappointing. I only saw one cut on the whole tape( the entire tape was only about 25 minutes long)that appeared to be recorded live or in a studio. The list of songs made me want to purchase this tape, however I wouldn't have had I of know of the content."
3,Optical quality?,"I have long owned a VHS copy of Olympia, and it wasn't visually bad, but of course I longed for the improvement a DVD version might bring. This release was a surprise - it seems to be not an optical transfer, but a DVD of the VHS version, horizontal analogue scan lines and all, and visually a disappointment. I realise that a total restoration is expensive and that the market for this kind of thing is relatively small, and I'll live with what I can get, but if Criterion ever releases a restored version, I'll be first in line. Until then, concentrate on the hypnotic, iconic content. As an avowed curmudgeon, I'm offended by yahoo patriots at international sporting events chanting USA!USA! from the bleachers. There they were, in 1936, chanting for Jesse Owens as he won four golds - then and there the patriot war cry seemed right."
1,Don't waste your money,"This disk is terrible. It is obviously cheaply digitized from a poor master tape. Don't purchase products by Pathfinder Home Entertainment, if this is an example of their business practice."
1,Terrible quality,"Very disappointing. The images are washed out: no definition, no crispness. Even as a reference copy it would be a strain on the eyes. Hard to understand why such a well known documentary was released in this poor condition."
3,Cruddy video transfer,The words 'digitally remastered' do not appear on this package anywhere. It looks as if they have merely reused an old VHS-era transfer and packaged it in a 'limited edition'. The picture and soundtrack both contain a huge amount of video noise and the source print is jittery and grainy.
1,Sold a used copy as new!,"What a ripoff!!I paid dearly for this DVD, which was listed as new. What I got was a repackaged, damaged used DVD! It even had the white edge labels with the usual ""security device"" notice. Both discs were scratched, with the first disc having a huge scrape like it had been dragged on a hard floor.I'd like to say something about the movie but my played can't even read it!!"
2,Pixelation,This digital transfer seems like a 4th generation bootleg copy because the quality is so bad. The pixelation is horrible. It could actually be a transfer from a VHS copy. Bootleggers do better work than this. The German national film archive in Berlin still has film copies. Why didn't they copy them for this release?
4,Olympia,"I had watched Olympia many years ago on PBS and was impressed with the photography. While there were shots of Hitler and Goring and other Nazi officials viewing the games, I actually found they were not excessive and probably would have been similiar had it been another country's leader viewing games in their own country. On the whole, I found the photography to be outstanding and the historical footage of the games very well done. I do understand that events and scenes were not necessarily taken ""in order"" but rather arranged to maximize the artistic effect. This was not a distraction. Truly, Leni Riefenstahl was an exceptional talent."
4,Undeniably influential,"Leni may have been an unpleasant person who deserved a lot of jail time for what she did, but she is undeniably talented with the camera. Anybody who is seriously studying cinema photography has to look at her technical work objectively and admire her innovations. It is beautifully shot. Admittedly there are lots of creepy, disturbing situations in the movie ( how would you like to march into a stadium and have 50,000 Nazis plus their Hitler stare at you) but there are also lots of inspirational moments too. Like Jesse Owens kicking Nazi butt in the Long Jump and one of the races. It's hard to be objective about a Nazi propaganda flick, but see for yourself and try."
3,Olympiad: Part I and II,"The quality of the transfer from film to tape is not the best but still very viewable. Seems to contain all the footage of the original version. Does not single/freeze frame well on my VCR, making analysis of technique difficult. Event coverage of track and field events is very good, with the flow of the competition preserved, especially in the field events."
5,Worth getting for Adrian Rollini's hot solos...,"Though Fred Elizalde & His Anglo American Band, weren't as hot as say McKinney's Cotton Pickers, or Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers, however they we're a very jazz oriented dance band, and they had the greatest bass sax player ever Adrian Rollini, who gets lot's of solo space on this generally excellent and remastered CD. This set of good 20's jazz is recommended mostly to Rollini collectors and 20's hot music fanatics."
5,Best record this year,"ok, i know that sounds insane, but ever since i popped this record in my cd player it has not come out. now, don't get me wrong, there are some great records out right now, but if you are a sucker for melody and pop sensibility, then this record is for you. this band gets compared to weezer and fountains of wayne a lot and those comparisons are true on many of this record's tracks, but there is also some punk rock inspired stuff and a nice slower song. anyhoo, i heard this on college radio and if these guys put out a second record and it's half as good as this one... well, it'll be a shame if they don't make a million bucks and rule the airwaves. ok, i'm a fan. buy this new or used man."
3,Great book...terrible price,"This is a fantastic book. I am in a Pilates teacher training program, and this book is a god send. However, I saw the same book new at Barnes and Noble for $42. How can a new book be less expensive than a used one? I'm totally lost. But anyway, buy the book!!! Just not here."
2,Food for thought,"This is a very popular book and often required in massage courses and other bodywork classes. Because of the popularity of Thomas Meyers, I have read his articles and bought this book. His article premises are often shaky - we do not have the physique of a rabbit, why would we compare our psoas function to one? - However I gave this book a good try. There are so many exceptions to his own rules that one questions the comprehensiveness of the theory. Yes the body is intricately connected through many systems, however Meyer's ideas seem to be forced to fit his premise. I did give this book a good try but quit it about 2/3rds of the way through. There are many other, better resources regarding the interlayered connectivity of our body's tissues."
1,pompous,"There is a ton of information and it goes on and on. If you have trouble sleeping pick up this book and you will be asleep in no time. I have been to a Thomas Myers seminar. Of course he wasn't there, it was someone that interned with him. And although we were a room of fitness and bodywork specialists most of us found that we would not be able to use the information with our clients. Very unfortunate that a this groundbreaking information is missing the next step."
3,Great book but must be updated,"While this is an excellent review text, it needs to be updated to incorporate the America Invents Act! It covered everything ELSE in my patents class, and then some, so I'm still happy."
5,Great follow through.....,"There was a problem with the activation of my gift card, but everybody was patient and all worked out great.After that was done, the book arrived in great time and was in excellent shape!Thanks!!!!"
5,Great game,Met my expectations for alternate games? I would certainly suggest it to anyone with pokeno who wants to add more players
5,Short Course in Common Sense,"If you want to know how to rid the world of poverty and oppression, answers can be found in this powerful little book. No matter your politics or world view, you'll want to read In Defense of Global Capitalism for the way it is written. Presented as a series of short logical arguments, Norberg shows, in clear concise English and very simple charts, the correlation between economic freedom and prosperity, not just economic prosperity but longer lives, better nutrition, higher education, better working conditions and an improved environment. A smart book, easy to read and easy to understand; give it to a friend."
5,A Habit For...FUN!,"This was one of the most fun books I've read in a long time. Characters were interesting and quirky, and I didn't know who ""did it"" until it was revealed. I had my suspicions, but no solid conclusions. It was so enjoyable, I gave copies to my 4 best friends as a gift. I'm looking forward to the next adventures of Nicky D'Amico. Hurry up and write, Zito!"
2,too large and too stiff,I like my Oneida salad tongs much better. Those Austen Tongs are too stiff and the angles of spoon and folk parts are not right. So they do not close together and it is very hard to pick vegetables.
2,He's Green! Let's Get Drunk And Kill Him!...,"A spaceship (don't worry, it's never shown) lands in the woods outside of Harleyville, USA. A college student sees it crash and calls his science professor for help. Together, they seek to make contact with the alien creature that has come out of the ship. Alas, the visitor has landed smack-dab in the middle of hillbilly country! Soon, every drunken slob with a shotgun is after him, trying to either steal his weapons or take his life! Will the poor E.T. survive? Can he ""invade"" before this town-ful of dimwits annihilates him?? Watch and see for yourself. I kept hoping the creature would blast the whole town to smithereens! GALAXY INVADER has a cast of characters who definitely skipped acting school! Don Dohler wrote, directed, and ""stars"" in this stale pile of space-poo. Oh my..."
1,Mind numbingly awful,"Alien spaceman, who looks like a cross between Swamp Thing and the Sleestaks from ""Land of the Lost"", crashes in a backwoods Maryland forest and gets chased around by busch guzzling rednecks intent on selling him. To whom exactly? Typical disfunctional redneck family drama with an alien subplot thrown in. The middle of the film seems to drag forever. The music is cheesily dated and the acting is sub-porn level. GI is included on the Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics package, and it's defintely one of the clunkers in the lot. Could be entertaining after eating mushrooms and drinking a bottle of sangria, but you'll get more out of watching the designs on the wallpaper move or trying to write the next great American road novel and taking off for LA, forgetting you have to work at McDonalds in the morning."
2,Not their best work,"I ordered this based on the title alone and ended up being disappointed. The movie itself was boring and there wasn't much the commentators could do to save it. I am personally a bigger Mike Nelson fan than I am a Joel fan, so perhaps I am prejudiced. I hope they release more movies from the more recent seasons soon..."
2,I accuse the producers,"I love Mystery Science theater and I've written several reviews for episodes I've bought on Amazon. When I was looking for new episodes to buy and came across this one, the reviews made ""I Accuse My Parents"" sound like the most amazing DVD in the world. It wasn't. I did, do, and always will like Mike better than Joel. This episode (wih Joel) was a huge dissappointment after reading all the fantastic reviews.The movie is about a kid who's on trial for something...murder or robbery or drug smuggling...and he blames his neglectful and adulterous parents for causig him to go to the dark side. The movie was tedious, the comments weren't all that funny, and I found myself wishing I had spent the money on blank videos to tape the episodes with Mike on the Sci-Fi channel.The funniest part was the short at the beginning of the movie ""Truck farming"" which had its moments."
2,Mildly Amusing,"Most of the experience I've had with MST3K were the episodes starring Mike Nelson. And when I saw this movie, I realized why. The film was bad, which was expected, but the comments from Joel, Crow, and Tom were not as amusing as I would've liked them to be. In fact, there were several times when I came up with a comment about a scene in ""I Accuse my Parents"" that was far funnier than anything they said. I didn't even watch the whole movie at once, which I usually do as a Mistie, because it was so un-humorous and the movie was so boring that I found more interesting things to do. I kept wishing that it would get funnier and it never did.If you want a good MST3K episode, buy ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" which stars Mike Nelson instead of Joel and is very funny. Joel is mediocre at best in comparison to Mike."
5,"Hye, I won the essay contest!","I like to think of I Accuse My Parents as the perfect gateway MST3K episode. Not only is the movie laughably moronic in several different ways--without being as mind numbingly boring as Manos, the Hands of Fate--it's proceeded by an awesome short about truck farming and the host segments are all pretty funny as well. My sister and I got my mother to drink the cool-aid with this one, and it was made better because she was pretty sure she'd actually seen the truck farming short in school. I also indoctrinated my girlfriend with it and now it's become one of her favorites.Yes, this is a Joel episode, but it's Joel at his best. If you don't come out of watching this with at least three or four new catch phrases added to your vocabulary, there is no hope for you at all. You should probably blame your parents for that."
5,"Oh, my mom. She's swell...........Liar! liar! liar!","Well, even though this isn't one of the best mst3k episodes i've seen, it still made me laugh till I passed out. The Truck Farmer short is so depressing. And, I kid you not, but I swear that I see my grandma and great grandma in the fields picking vegetables! And they did do that work back then in that area! ""My Grandma"" is the one where Joel comments, ""A preteen is put to work, her beauty will soon fade."" Too bad they're not alive anymore to back my story. But the movie was hilarious, with that poor dumb clod Jimmy, who's one big liar, and is the ownner of a real complicated haircut. There's his drunk mom, a corpse for a dad, and a girlfriend with a weird profile. Also the mob is involved somehow. Add a hamburger garnished with french fried potatoes and you got I accuse My Parents! Enjoy!"
5,Joel and the 'Bots are on their game . . .,"This is some of their best work. The zingers are well delivered right on time and funny. The total package is helped along by what is somewhat of a good movie in a 40s/50s sort of way. It's a preachy story about a geeky ""good kid"" who goes astray due to neglectful alcoholic (but well-dressed) parents. The ""kid"" seems to be in his mid-30's and has to range everywhere from a brown-nosing high school dork -- to a fawning lovestruck boy -- to an armed robber. Strange but entertaining. The hottie he's stuck on does a little music number that sticks in your head. With the assistance of MST3K, this one was fun and I will revisit it."
5,Definitely one of the best MST3K episodes.,This movie has all the classic elements ripe for riffing and the riffing is really ripe in this episode. Gotta have for all msties!
5,One of the Funniest DVD's,"This is one of the funniest DVD's that I have seen of MST3K. I have a nice collection of tapes and DVD's and find ""I Accuse My Parents"" to be one of the funniest.There is an OK short about ""Truck Farming"" and then the movie. I tell you, one of the reasons this episode works is because of the ridiculous plot in the film. A drunk mom and womanizing dad lead our poor hero to a life of petty crime. Poor guy. This film is just bearable enough to actually watch and Joel and ""the bots"" do a great job smacking it.Even after a couple of viewings you'll probably want to keep this DVD nearby for play on nites the satellite goes down, as background at a party or to impress some friends who have never heard of MST3K. It's good, it's cheap and it's DVD. Cool."
1,Boring.,I won't sum up the book since the first reviewer did so quite nicely. This book was so boring that I thought I would just put it down. It went between a religious romance then dabbed to sensual. I think that writer was hoping for an Easter miracle with this one...
1,Musical barf,"This album stinks, the lyrics and trite and the music itself makes me want to tear my eyebrows off."
4,Props to Isobel + Friends,"The arrangements on The Green Fields of Foreverland are wonderfully sparse and lovingly played. They are clear and simple, a virtue that most bands could learn from. The playing is certainly amateur, but makes no effort to hide this and that is (mostly) charming. Most of the songs are very quiet and full of atmosphere.The lyrics are lovely and poetic, occasionally funny. It's not navel-gazing stuff."
3,Gentley Does It.,"I was lucky enough to see the gentle Waves in concert for free (don't ask, it's a long story) before I had even heard any of their material. All I knew was that It was Isobel Campbell from Belle and Sebastian.After enduring two 'Arty' films, the band cam on and performed a good, 'amateur' show. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mean that as a bad thing, It was, and is part of the charm of the Gentle Waves. The sort of meek and friendliness of the band is part of their persona.Anyway, the album sounds pretty much as they do live, very folksy, with Isobel's whispy vocals oozing all over the songs.Belle and Sebastian fans will like it. Fans of folk music will like it. Marilyn Manson fans may not find it their cup of tea."
4,Turn The Lights Down Low,This is a very enjoyable CD and a perfect way to end a day. Given the work with B & S it was going to be interesting to hear what this sounded like and I was pleasantly surprised with how different it sounds.
1,Useless,"I purchased this air filter a few weeks ago. Apart from being very noisy, it was totally ineffective. After running for two weeks, the filter still has not collected any dust! I didn't research enough before buying an air purifier, but now realize that HEPA is the only way to go if you actually want to purify your air, not just move it around.UPDATEAs a replacement purifier I purchased the Honeywell 17000 HEPA QuietCare Air Cleaner (see my review of this product). It works much better and actually removes particles etc from the air really well.I tried selling my IFD fiter on E-Bay but no one would buy it - not even for 3 dollars! What a POS!"
2,A bit too noisy,"The unit is a bit too noisy, so much that it is very annoying if not on the low setting (but still noisy). I've had it several months, and have found it to be reliable, but not that good of a cleaner. It is a bit large, but not heavy. It's probably best for a room in which you wish to circulate air, with a small bit of purifying needed."
4,Honeywell Enviracare Tower Air Purifier,"This is excellent value for the money. The fan is noiser than on more expensive models, but no lounder than a regular fan. However, the plastic control broke after two days from being turned in the wrong direction by my toddler. I'd recommend a push button control for anyone with kids."
4,Don't understand all the complaints!!!,"I have 3 dogs that shed constantly; combined with the pet dander and I had a real problem with dust and hair EVERYWHERE. Plus I really don't like to clean, (typical bachelor). After running my unit for two weeks I noticed a real change in the amount of floating dust (which you can see when the sunshines through a window)in the air."
1,piece of crap,I purchased this purifier and I turned the knob and it broke the same day . I don't know if I just got a bad one or what but it seem so cheap . I guess there was a reason why it was on sale. look for something with a better review. I taught the name would make it a great buy I guess I was wrong.....
1,~Big Convoluted Mess~,"O.K...Let me see,...I think I've got it! An Action Thriller about a Veteran Spy Agent in a Mission to Rescue one Student Colleague of his who is in a Chinese Prison ""Spy Game"" reunites two of the Biggest Hollywood Stars (you'll wonder why) in a Big Great Convoluted Mess of a Film. Filled with a Barrage of Flashbacks that inclines you to loose interest in a Hurry. A Puzzle not too clear put together to make a Big Monumental Long Long Trailer. A Film that will leave you wondering...""What was That All About?"""
2,Get Exam Cram!,I've read this book. Cover to cover. I was disapointed as subnetting was not explain in details. I had to go out and buy Exam Cram and explantions was way better than Exam Prep. I'd say this book was a waset of money. (Sorry to say that)
1,What exam are we preparing for?,"I have been generally impressed with previous Certification Insider Press offerings. I figured that this book would be up to par and a reasonable guide for preparing for the TCP/IP exam. The author seems to have missed the point. This is an ""EXAM PREP"" book. What exam am I being prepped for with this book? Only occasionally did I feel that I was actually getting TCP/IP information. The unrelated information may have some value, but not at this stage of the certification game. Chapters on installing NT? Why? By the time an individual is studying for TCP/IP, I imagine that this topic is old hat. One would have been exposed to NT install information for at least the NT Server and Enterprise exams, and possibly even NT Workstation. The case study sections seemed useless to me as well. On the topic of TCP/IP I can say EXAM CRAM--YES, EXAM PREP--NO!!!"
2,Very incomplete!,This book can't help you pass the exam in any way! Get the Exam Cram and lots of practice tests instead!
1,"Terrible book. Fireplace fodder, at best.","This ""Exam Prep"" was an unbearable wandering through the mind of an ""author"" that seems to have no concept of who the target audience of this book is. There are PLENTY of better TCP/IP books on the market, and as far as preparing for the MCSE exam, this book is junk. (Note to Amazon, please allow a zero-star rating option for books like this.) The Exam-Cram for TCP/IP was a FAR better source of information. DO NOT BUY (or even take from a friend's garbage can) THIS BOOK!"
1,Horrible! Avoid at all costs!,"I have read a number of Coriolis books to date, most have been very helpful in preparing for my exams. This is the exception. This book has too many typos and technical mistakes to count. Mistakes are NOT limited to simple spelling errors that can be worked around or overlooked. They exist in the diagrams and examples used to explain difficult issues. One wonders if the author has ever taken the TCP/IP exam. The CD ROM with practice tests does not even work! You can take the test, but the program will NOT grade the test or let you review the missed Q's! How helpful can that possibly be?"
2,Disappointingly little regional information,"A better description than the title provides would be ""200 Tips for growing flowers (particularly in the Pacific Northwest)"" -- the vast majority of these tips are generic flower growing ideas and have no special bearing on this region. The sections on weather and garden health are the only ones that really benefit from a Pacific NW focus. If you are looking for a regional flower-gardening guide this is not it. If you want a list of flower growing hints and ideas, and happen to live in the Northwest, this book might have some value to you, especially if you are looking for a few pointers on planning and design, with suggested plant combinations apparantly suitable for this region."
3,Not the Best Quality,"This review ""is not"" a reflection on Amazon.com I received this ball very quickly from Amazon as I do with any purchase. My problem is with American DJ. I received my first 12"" mirror ball with several cracked pieces of glass. All the broken pieces were intact, but cracked. I returned it through Amazon and received another one within a week. The second one had cracked glass as well, but 50% less than the first one. I had 2 events, a wedding and a fiesta party therefore I kept the ball. I would suggest looking at other manufacturers before purchasing."
4,great,"this worked out perfectly for the dance party we were planning, and is now a fun fixture in our basement theater.there were a couple of cracked tiles when we received it, but i was sort of expecting that and it doesn't bother me much. i just wanted the best value, and feel like that's what we got. the size is perfect, and it fit our needs completely!"
4,Pretty darn good. . .if you haven't seen Funny Girl,"I actually saw this movie before I saw Funny Girl, so I must say that, standing alone, it's a pretty good movie. James Caan is quite charming as the producer and fan of Fanny Bryce looking to get rich. They're sparring relationship, and the resulting romance, is charming, in a kind of ""Two For The Road"" or Sam and Diane kinda way.Compared to Funny Girl, this movie, of course, doesn't stand up. There is no very little Omar Shariff, and the adult Fanny is harder, less charming that the Funny Girl Fanny. However, Barbra performance is still riveting, and, most importantly, still funny."
2,1 SMOKIN' SINGER!!!,"omg what a phenomenal body perfectly showcased in those amazing Mackie gowns, everything, anyone, sets, just disappear with her centerstage.. Did Phillip Morris back this sequel, never saw so much chain smoking for a singer/entertainer ever!! Everything else in this film was just a sorrowful flat note despite the high expectations after Funny Girl. The personalities, the on screen chemistry, the arrangements, set designs 'cept for the proposal stage model, were disjointed and misrepresented for time period. Not sure what hair and makeup did with Babs but she looked washed out and the DP did not help with her good side. Ben Vereen was an exceptional talent and provided the most polished sequence despite the hideous color scheme for costumes on the two women, 1930's??? When the comedy is reduced to a wild buffalo, face powder fights, and aqua clowns it's time to call it a day and say how lucky I am it's over."
5,AMAZING.,"This is an amazing, amazing book. It's easy to read, engaging, and the tone is casual but the content is rich and nuanced - both accesible and intelligent. If you only read three books in your life, this should be one of them. I'm not exaggerating."
3,WHAT SEX AM I?,"Kate BornsteinGender Outlaw:On Men, Woman, and the Rest of Us(New York: Routledge, 1994)An inside account of a high-profile male-to-female transsexual.Kate says she always knew she was a girleven tho biologically she was a boy.And she always found the idea of crossing overto become a woman sexually exciting.In 1993, when she wrote this book,she considered herself a lesbian,but her female lover was changing to become a man.This reviewer found it difficultto believe that the author is a woman.Her personality as it come thru in the writingstill seems to be mostly 'masculine'.In a later book My Gender Workbook,s/he declares her/himself to be neither sex.My Gender Workbook is reviewed in another bibliography on the Internet:""BOOKS ON TRANSSEXUALISM"".If you would like to read other first-person accounts of sex-changing,search the Internet for this bibliography:""Transsexualism--Autobiographies""."
3,The Freaks come out at night 101,"Take boring feminist theory, victim ideology and throw in a trans-""gender"" and you have ""Gender Outlaw"". Kate Bornstein's book throws in every two bit cliche. Shamans, angry lesbian feminists and theatre queers. While it was a fun ride for a while I got real tired of the repetitive manifesto of gender. It should be required reading for transsexualology 101 if there ever were a course. Not bad reading, but Kate drags and drags and drags you to crossdress with gender concepts."
5,Desert Theme Amazing!,"I got this CD primarily for the Desert theme (that I couldn't find in the video). The part when it builds up around 2:40 ... with the electric guitar ... for those three notes, it's worth it. Excellent job, Toto. Very musical, somewhat subdued...classic! I went and saw the movie because of the music (and because it was mentioned in Chuck...and sandworms are epic...)"
3,We're not in Kansas anymore...,"I'm not quite the Dune nerd some people are, but I found this vinyl recently for a few bucks and took it home. I like David Lynch, Dune and Toto. Toto does a good job setting the proper mood for a sci-fi film, just don't expect anything like their pop songs. They really do the entire soundtrack other than the ""Prophecy Theme"" from Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. I won't break-down each track, but it works as a whole, and does take you back to the film, as any good soundtrack should. Not many bands can easily take you away to a desert planet just two years after taking you to ""Africa""."
4,Great soundtrack to way underrated film!,This is really a very cool movie soundtrack to a very cool movie.I would give it 5 stars but it is missing a couple of songs.
4,Toto + Eno=Dune Dreamscape,"The most noteworthy and memorable tracks here are the Prologue with actress Virginia Madsen's introduction/plot setting monologue to the story of Dune, the semi-soft rock and classical fusion sound of Take My Hand(closing credits), the Eno melancholy and haunting synthesized Prophecy theme, and the Dune Desert Theme. All else is richly orchestrated, written, and performed by Toto with various background synthesizer effects. The Brian Eno minimalistic new age/spacescape Prophecy Theme blends in seamlessly with the rest of Toto's score; you will forget that there were two different artists involved with the soundtrack ! They work in unison and great coherency...Even though the soundtrack to Dune cannot rival that of New Age artist Vangelis' BladeRunner OST it still captivates the very essence and moody spirit of the film ! Toto and Eno will take you to the universe of Frank Herbert's/David Lynch's Dune..."
4,"A mixed bag, but some excellent songs","This album was very mixed quality. Some songs, like the main title, are monolithic pieces that immediatly bring to mind scenes of the windy desert. Others are more quiet ambience. Unfortunately, a few are a cheezy new age rock. But go for it. The good songs outweigh the bad ones, and I don't know--maybe you like new age light rock."
3,It's good but could be better,"The music itself is wonderful, it evokes such strong imagery of the film and I find it enjoyable. The reason I give it 3 stars is that not all of the score is on the album. There is so much more music that was in the film but not on the album. If you are going to put out an album than put the entire score on it and not a few select pieces."
3,we really had fun with this,"We love reading about our community, and we have to confess we enjoy gossip! Not the best written book ever, but loads of dirt!"
2,Apparently EVERYONE on earth is gay according to this author,"I read this book primarily for the interview with Barbara Stanwyck, who I adore. What a book. The author seems to believe that it is his calling in life to FORCE people, primarily the dead ones, to admit that they are gay, whether or not they are, mainly because HE is. Barbara Stanwyck had class, was intensely private, and so what? If people want to discuss their sex lives and have the information published for the world to see, fine. Personally, I have a lot more respect for people, gay or otherwise, who mind their own business and expect the rest of the world to do the same. I have yet to see a connection between one's sexuality and one's artistic ability. (...) I'm honestly ashamed I read the damned thing."
1,What a boreing read!,"Being a Hollywood gossip hound, I found this book basicly a waste of time to read. None of the interviewed women ever come out of the closet. And most refuse to discuss other people. An admirable quality but not something that makes for a good read."
3,"Good reading, but...","Tom Franklin is a wonderful writer. Each story is exciting and interesting, but only one story has, what I would call, an ending (the last one in the book). I'd love to read more by Franklin...I just hope the next book/story will have an ending."
1,Disappointing,"Quite possibly one of the worst books I've ever read. If you're into reading about a bunch of losers and excessive animal cruelty, then go for it. The degree to which the author relies on torturing animals to print a story is a little extreme. I hate that I wasted my money."
1,Simplistic focus on the vulgar.,"Promising autobiographical opening describing the genuine internal conflict in learning to hunt mostly for social approval, and finding within himself both fascination and revulsion in the act. The remaining stories are one dimensional obsessions with the cruel, crude and vulgar which ignore any hint of more positive thoughts or motivations or experiences which might bring a sense of realism. I left the book on the airplane, but should have consigned it to the trash."
1,I think Tom Franklin went way too far with foul language.,I would hesitate to let any of my friends borrow this book because of the language he has used which has added nothing to the plots of the stories!
2,Poachers,"I was disappointed by the stories in Poachers, even with the understanding that this was a first effort. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the shorter works that appear in collections."
3,Good,"Great to see someone writing stories for men. Reminded me of Pinckney Benedict's ""Town Smokes"", but without the lyricism. Grit and Poachers were good stories but the ones inbetween were mostly mediocre. They keep you turning the page, but you forget them quickly. The technique is here, the material is here, but the missing element is the kind of insight and character developement that Pete Dexter and James Dickey use to weight their stories, to make them unforgetable. But at least Mr. Franklin is heading in the right direction. Look forward to his next. HB"
5,Special,"Life is strange sometimes. For instance this book I read on a balmy Autumn day in a beach town. What has that got to do with Southern Prose ...well not a lot really. But Tom Franklin managed to take me to a very different land peopled by white trash , black trash , cajun trash and any other assortment of trash you want. The tales are compelling as they represent the poor not only in Mobile , Alabama but perhaps everywhere. How's that for cross cultural....To the stories wherein they are beautifully written picking the pace and tone of the country they deal with. Some are intense and devote themselves to violence and mayhem. Others offer poignant moments not quite completed. Five stars is well worth it."
3,Just OK,Some of this author's work has impressed me but not this one. I find myself looking at other authors for my reading.
3,Did they steal this from the library,"So, when I ordered this book, for my friend, I thought it would be the kind you by at Amazon and not the kind you check out from the library. The bar codes and library tags were still all over it with the Dewey decimal slip in the back. Not something you give a friend. VERY disappointed with the seller on this one. I hope it doesn't need to be returned.Good book. Davis is an old friend and I know his grocery empire very well. This is a great read for anyone interested in how a small grocery store in the south grew up to be the fifth largest in America.The seller gets rotten tomatoes though... if you're going to send a library book at least have the decency to put that in your description. I would have bought from someone else.SHAME ON YOU!"
5,Best Spanish program!,"This book is the perfect blend of beautiful presentation and ease of use! By following a young girl, Grace, and her family through their daily activities in song and through easy to follow pages along with CD, the child learns to speak, read and sing Spanish! Color illustrations catch the child's attention and keep it. Also, it is thoroughly Catholic throughout, with the child learning the Sign of the Cross, Grace Before Meals, Our Father, and much more! You are going to love this book!!"
5,It Works!,This product fit right into my 1998 Honda Accord LX 4 door sedans coolant reservoir area. Very pleased! Product works just like it is supposed to.
3,Its okay,"Service was great! much faster than I expected. Book is not quite what I had hoped for, but will be handy for reference as I attempt to trace my family geneology"
5,Great Book,"This is a must have for any of those with Native American ancestry, its a great book and so worth having."
3,yes,I just wanted to say that I agree with what the reviewer named Mary had to say. I am researching my own Cherokee ancestry and would like to buy the Dawes Rolls but can't afford to pay that much for a book just now. I'll buy it someday but it does irritate me that it costs so much.I think it should be publicly available to anyone who wants to read it.
3,Poor recording quality,"While the interpretation of these pieces are just fine--very good even--the impact is totally ruined by the poor recording quality, particularily on the Burleske. Hissing is loud and grainy, echos blur the sound together, and little pops and clicks are alarmingly common. If you care to rip the tracks and remaster them manually then this CD is worth your time, especially for the horn concertos, since the Herman Baumann versions of the horn concertos are very hard to find now, especially the second. If you just want the CD for a CD player, then I recommend finding another CD."
5,Meet Taylor Barnes,"""Corbalo's Gold"" may be a first novel, but it could not have been better if it had been the author's second or third. Its principal character is Taylor Barnes, age 50, a late bloomer who's spent the last 25 years married to his childhood sweetheart. It's a great marriage; then she dies and he's got to conquer his grief and will himself to start all over again. Thechallenges he faces, the obstacles he must overcome make forexciting reading. The kind that induces reveiwers to try to come up with a new way to say ""I couldn't put it down."""
5,Does a Lot of Work for You,"This book is very nice, having the Greek majority text on the page, with corresponding English translations of every Greek word underneath, and the New King James version is in the margins for comparison. There are also textual notes at the bottoms of the margins as well as notes about how other Greek texts are different in some verses. I give the book 5 stars as a product.Now let me tell you not to use interlinears. It completely defeats the purpose of working with the Greek text. Hodges and Farstad have made a number of judgment calls in their ultra-literal translation, so you are really just buying their opinions. You might as well just have a translation that you trust in front of you. Interlinears fake you into thinking you are working with the Greek text when you are actually just working with the observations of those who made the interlinear. Do yourself a favor and learn Greek."

2,A naive romanticization of the medieval lifestyle,"There was much here that I disagreed with.It is true that ultimately, we may all be forced by environmental limitations to go back to a medieval lifestyle of subsistence farming, village dwelling, minimal international trade, illiteracy, poverty, stagnation, immobility, and superstition, but I do not think, as Schumacher seems to, that this development would be something to be celebrated. I honestly think that people who like this book don't really understand the lifestyle that they are buying into. They want rustic village living, but with all the benefits of industrial society on demand."
5,Beautiful Technique and Attentive to Details,"""Fingerbreaker"" is pure pleasure. Morten Gunnar Larsen has beautiful technique. He's attentive to details, and adds a few tasteful embellishments that don't detract from the original scores. I'd like to hear more of his recordings, but haven't found any others here at Amazon. I think you'd enjoy this CD."
4,brilliant idea; surprisingly great movie,"While this movie lacks A-list stars, it is surprisingly good comedy! It's a fun movie with the lead character talking to the camera a'la Ferris Bueller. Too bad this didn't get a wide release."
5,loved the movie,"its not a usual movie...the meaning behind it, is very powerful in spiritual terms.story is good. i watched it several times...and every time i enjoy it. Highly recommended.try watching the movie with the eyes of..""life is a movie, who is watching this movie ?""observe the observer!"
5,Great watch,"I've never paid more than about $50 for a watch until this one jumped at me. It was time to get a ""decent"" watch, and I really liked the chronograph styling. Going strictly on aesthetics, this one looks great, and feels sturdy. When I took a closer look and found all the features available I was instantly sold! The perpetual year is a great feature, and I've seen several other reviewers complain that it doesn't have a daylight savings feature... well, there are actually places in the world that DON'T do daylight savings; and after living in Hawaii for the last 4 years, it would have been really annoying for my watch to suddenly adjust itself."
5,Great watch!,The citizen calibre 8700 is the most functional watch i own! I bought it as a casual everyday watch but this watch is Gorgeous the ad photo doesn't do it justice. This watch retails at $450.00 i got on amazon for $225 and i have had it confirmed as being authentic and brand new. What a GREAT Deal!
4,Easy read calendar watch,"This is one of the best calendar watches on the market. It has proven durable and accurate. Most important for me, with aging eyes, it is easy to read. All functions are useful and logical to set and use. One disappointment is the alarm. It is weak and if the battery is low, as in winter, it may not sound. The alarm most be considered a backup only."
4,EXCELLENT WATCH,"My husband's friends had an eco-drive watches that he adored, so I went to the store to purchase one for my husband. The price tag was around 400.00 with the 10% off sale. I purchased it brand-new on Amazon for nearly half that and he loves the watch. Thanks Amazon!!!"
4,I hope they had one day shipping for watches,"The product is perfect.I purchased it for my husband as an anniversary gift and he loves it a lot.The only problem was that amazon didn't have a one day shipping on watches and I didn't know that, so it arrived one day later which wasn't good.I hope amazon adds one day shipping for watches also."
1,Second one - both lose 1/2 hour randomly every few weeks,"I got one last september. After about 2 weeks I noticed it would be late by 15 to 30 minutes. I'd reset. A few days or a week later same thing. I left it in the sun for 8 hours to charge. Same thing happened a few days later. This is a complicated watch. I have read and reread the manual. There is nothing I am not understanding about operating the watch. You should be able to charge it once and leave it run. It get plenty of sun.Exchanged it for another of the same model. Same exact thing is now happening after about 3 months. Thought I got a good one but guess not. If two of these do the same thing for one guy, I would seriously suspect the quality of this watch. I've never had any problem with a decent quality watch before this."
4,Great Buy,"I bought this watch back in early 2007, and I have worn it almost every day since. It is an amazing deal for a watch. No problems at all, and at the end of every month I do not have to advance the date to the correct day number. It is near perfect. The only reasons why I did not give it a 5 star are the mineral crystal watch window, and the size. This watch should have a sapphire crystal so that it stays looking great year after year, and the thickness and heft of the watch are a mixed blessing. Nice and sturdy feeling, but at times is a lot to have on your arm, at least for me. This watch is highly recommended for people who like easy. Set it once, and correct for day light savings time, and forget about it. No batteries, not incorrect date, no fuss. Classy"
4,Awesome Watch,"Its an awesome watch. I had it now for almost 2 months. You need to read the manual before you plan on making adjustments. The only disappointing thing was that it does not adjust for Day light savings time. It would have been nice if it self adjusted. Other than this, all other features are nice. It can be used as a dress or a casual watch also. Love it!!!!! Amazon shipping was also awesome."
4,"Great functions, however easily scratched dial and case.","I love the watch, very stylish yet classic. Impressive solar technology.Only downside is that the dial is really easily scratched, coz it's just made of regular glass. The polished dial is also easily scratched, only a few month in use and scratches are building up.Next purchase I'd be sure to go titanium and sapphire crystal."
1,Worst watch I have ever bought,"I have always bought cheep $100 watches and I said that I would not do that again. I wanted something that would last more than 1 year befor it need to be replaces. I got this watch on a cruse (Not through Amazon). I paid $275 and was told about how to charge it under a light. For the 1st month I had very little problems. After 1 month I started loosing time. I had to charge it under a 100W light for an hour every day and it would still be 5 minutes slow at the end of the day.DON'T BUY THIS WATCH!!!!!IF YOU DO, JUST REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU NOT TO BUY THE WATCH!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"Bought a Citizen Eco watch at Sams. Only kept it a couple weeks. Complicated, hard to use, had to get the instructions out just to reset the time, and I hated it. The date is so small, I needed a magnifying glass to read it. The only thing that kept it from going in the garbage is that my daughter was visiting and I gave it to her for my son in law. He has a Timex. He tried the Citizen for a few days, but since then I see he is wearing the old Timex. He said he didn't like the Citizen either. Guess I wasted my money"
1,dont buy it,"i bought this straightener cuz it was cute and purple and i thought it was gonna work really good on my hair, and it has a crimper, and stuff. but all it did was sorta flatten my hair and didnt do it very good, and it took forever to heat up im not very patient so i like to get the 60 second ones, also i felt as if it was ripping my hair, and my hair kept getting caught in it. dont buy it"
4,Accurate description and Fast shipping,"The seller represented this product very well. The description given was very accurate, which is something I don't find often with other sellers. I asked for expedited shipping after another seller failed to deliver my order after 1 month of waiting. This seller sent an email the day the book was shipped and the package arrived in no time. I would definitely use the seller again in the future."
1,"If you need to know Access, this is your book","At work, I had to rebuild an Access database that had been corrupted after a crash. I managed it but knew I needed to know not only what to do but why I was doing it. I took a class at a local community college and this was the book used as a textbook. As I worked my way through the book, all of the things I had puzzled out started to make real sense. Plus I learned some of the small tricks you don't learn when you teach yourself a piece of software. I could have sold the book back at the end of the class but I decided it would be better to keep it as a reference book. I haven't been disappointed. This one makes more sense than the Access Bible."
4,What would this world be without countertenors?,"I met my first countertenor a few years ago and I had the priviledge of singing beside him in our choir. The incredible purity of the countertenor voice is something that I, as a Baroque music lover, can only dream of achieving. I think that Andreas Scholl is one of the most incredible countertenors today. The purity of his sound and the passion of his performances speaks to me in ways that only music can. I own several of his albums, and this is my favorite. Nothing is quite incredible as in 'Pallido Il Sole' when he dips into his natural baritone register for a few notes and comes back up again. There is something mystical and beautiful about male altos and we, as the female counterparts, should try to emulate."
2,"Great first movie, HORRIBLE second one","I do'nt understand how you can call a movie a 'sequal' if it doesn't even have the same cast, half the same idea, etc.I reread it and wouldn't be angry if someone put this in the review and I read it, and it's really not the major plot****Spoiler for the second movie (maybe)!!! ****The second movie was based on the same initial dillema. Have to get something from somewhere because somebody got killed. Going from best friends (first movie) to someone you don't know (second) is a little far fetched, and actually really dumb. I hated the second movie so much for what it could have been.**** /End Spoiler ****All in all I absolutely loved the first movie and the way it ended..."
4,An original and thought provoking story that will stirr you.,"This story is about an aristocrat named Augusto, and his efforts to obtain the love of a woman he has fallen desperately in love with. The story-line sounds pretty common, but the author puts a totally different twist on it when Augusto, his fictional entity, pays him a visit to discuss his future plans. Once confronted, Augusto and Unamuno involve in a thought-provoking and emotioanl conversation. The best parts are the latter part of the book and amazingly, the epilogue. In the epilogue, Augusto's dog - Orfeo - narrates a sad summary of his owner's life, in a hilarious yet emotional sort of way. I highly recommend it."
3,Wrong item,The spray is good... I ordered the lotion though and got spray. My dog has a very dry spot and I think the lotion I ordered would have made more of an impact rather than the spray theysent.
1,Received spray instead of lotion!,Very disappointed! I have a young puppy with terribly itchy skin. I have hydrocortisone spray but it's hard to get the spray on his skin through his hair. I wanted the lotion with the applicator tip so hopefully the lotion would reach the skin. He's biting and scratching constantly. Our vet is trying to determine what allergies he has but in the meantime we're just trying to give him some relief! Now we'll have to wait to get the correct item.
4,grunge influences,"well, valentine saloon are most probably glam rock band turned into Grunge as the 90's rolled in. Sir Jack Endino Produced this one, so you know what to expect.Good thick, grungy sounds and guitars, strictly for the people who like this genre.I liked it, I think You will too. GET IT"
2,Not what I expected!!,Very raw and poor grainy video in some of them. A few different blues black musicians playing guitar in different performances. Never seen or heard the musicians.
4,good buy,"great item the only thing I didnt like was the prnted writing on it, I was using this for a peagent and seeing the stamp onit wasnt most atractive wish it was a peel off sticker, other than that a good priced item"
2,"Flimsy, but okay for costume use.","I bought this as a prop for my Little Bo Peep costume last halloween. It was very flimsy, and the plastic was virtually see-through, but it did okay. I would NOT suggest using it as a toy, as a child would doubtless break it very quickly."
3,Broke,Bought this for Halloween. Was broken after one day as it is made of plastic and not very good quality. If you are looking for something to use once like I did it works perfectly.
2,Shepherd Staff,"Easy to decorate, hard to screw together. Not very durable and very tall and difficult to get in and out of a car if used with a Halloween Costume. We did not use one of the attachments as it was hitting ceiling fans and wouldn't fit in the car."
3,Overpriced,"As a graduate student, I thought this would fill my needs for a planner. While useful and having a very good layout (3-4 days per pages), it is NOT worth the price. With a flimsy, cheap plastic cover, this is something I could see purchasing for six to eight dollars. Spend a little extra money on a filofax or Franklin Covey planner."
5,awesome day planner,the Quick notes section makes it easy to create to do lists - love that it is week at at time + the monthly view.
1,Don't bother-- not worth the price,"I was disappointed in this planner.The planner is flimsy. The paper used for the pages is so thin, you can see the lines of the next two pages through them. It makes for a very messy, confusing ""organizer.""Since the majority of the work week (M,Tu,Th,F) boxes fall on the left side of the open pages, my hand rests on the spiral while writing... may be more suitable for a lefty... if you can get past the fact that it's overpriced.Additionally, I ordered the planner on August 21 with 2-day shipping, and did not receive it until 2 weeks later!"
1,Very poor vendor description,"Item # AAG761105 Appointment Book was purchased in error, as the 1/2 year 2007 - 1/2 year 2008 was well hidden in the descriptive text (my error for not reading all the legalize; vendor error for not being upfront in the product description - see how long it takes you, the customer, to realize what is being sold)."
3,The first in the series Dragonball Z,"Summary: One of the few remaining Saiyan warriors arrives on the planet Earth to search for his younger brother.Athough my first impression of these episodes was that they were a bit 'corny', I now realize that they are an important part of the series. As all DB fans know, the relationships between the characters and the depths to which they are developed in the series is part of the joy of watching DBZ. This video starts showing us 'who's who and why' almost from the beginning. I bought ""Arrival"" and enjoy watching it over and over because this is where Goku begins to learn of his true heritage and because it has a 'classic' scene where he and his brother don't quite see eye to eye. <hehe> Although ""Arrival"" isn't as good as the newest releases like ""Mysterious Youth"" and ""Prelude to Terror"", I'm still glad I bought it."
4,I know you can get better.,"I know dragonball z can get better. But I have not sen the japanees verion ""yet""."
2,"Might be good information in there, but reads like a law school text/lecture","While this book has some good material, I felt that the law school textbook format made it challenging to read and VERY challenging to find particular subject matter when I went looking. Since I'm not in law school any longer, my desire to read books in a law school textbook format is very low.If this book were rewritten in a more approachable format, with graphs, pictures, etc. when appropriate, I could easily give it a more favorable rating."
4,Wizard of oz freak,"i saw this a long time ago and thought it was A WONDERFUL EVENT i think all Oz fans should get it Liza minelli ""Journey back to oz"" should be good too that is my next buying at Amazon Market place. Make sure the owner has your same email yahoo aol or hotmail before you reply. It goes faster. weird accounts may not access all the time.Judy Would be proud of this video i think I am writing PHANTOM IN OZ BASED ON PHANTOM AND WIZARD OF OZ AND GREASE. including songs from other major musicals. EMAIL ME TO FIND OUT MORE MUSICALTHEATER2003@YAHOO.COM"
5,Great Human Interest,"After viewing this movie, I realized I had already seen it in the past.... How great to see that a story such as this can not only catch my interest once, but catch it twice. Well worth paying for twice and hope some of the money goes back into our ""lifestyle""."
3,Documentary Video,Not a huge fan of documentary type films. I was expecting something a little different and a real sucker for love story drama. Although the material I found to be relevant and interesting.
5,The best physical organic chemistry book ever.,This is the deeper and best book I have of physical organic chemistry. It's a classic.
3,Not for self-learning,"Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry is an ""old-school"" type of textbook. There are no answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. Further, there is no solution manual. The ""old-school"" philosophy was to make the student slog through the assigned problems, and then contact the teacher for the answers. This approach is fine in some circumstances, but troublesome for those who need to learn the material on their own. As such, the textbook is not very good for self-learning.The authors did a good job of presenting the material. After reading a chapter, one can walk away thinking he has a good understanding of the material. Of course, the student really has no way to test this.A much better text for physical organic chemistry is ""Modern Physical Organic Chemistry"" by Anslyn and Dougherty. I recommend getting their solutions manual as well as their text."
1,Broke before ever used,"Maybe I was just unlucky, but.. I bought two of these. Opened one and tried bending it a couple of times. The larger ratchet mechanism worked fine. The smaller ratchet mechanism clicked and held the device in position for one or two bends, then stopped clicking and allowed the hinged parts to flop about freely. Didn't even ever plug it into a computer or plug anything into it. Didn't bother to open the second one."
1,Fell Apart,Set this up on a laptop and let it be. It fell apart two weeks later after not being touched whatsoever. Very disappointing.
4,usb angle adapter,Slick little device tht keeps usb cables or wireless receivers at a convenient angle to my laptop. And the price is right.
2,works sometimes,"Right out of the package, this product didn't work. After I ""exercised"" the adapter by flexing it, it began to work but the slightest movement can cause it to fail. I'm trying to use it in a place where there is little or no movement, but it still occasionally loses connection. Moving it slightly usually re-establishes the connection. I'm trying to use this as it is, but I wouldn't buy another one. Although the flexibility is a nice feature, I'm going to buy a fixed adapter next time."
5,Another useful item,As I have mentioned better to have one and not need it then to need it and not have it. I used mine to connect to the back usb port of a wall mounted flat panel TV
5,One small and powerful USB product.,"The FlexUSB does exactly what it claims to: it allows you connect a USB device to your computer at any angle. I have an USB network adapter in mine, and it's incredible. If you think you need one, buy two, you're certain to find a use for the other one. Makes a great stocking stuffer!"
2,Not up to par,"I ordered this device for use with my notebook thinking it would allow me to flip dongles and flash drives any other direction than straight out.I was more than a little dissappointed.Pros - flexible, ratcheting, good connectorsCons - not stiff enough, internal ribbon cable pinchesWhile this looked like what I need, a couple of major problems jumped out.1) If you use this to reposition a flash drive (OCZ 8gb) and have to carry your notebook, just the act of walking will allow the drive to move. If you don't check before you set it down - one broken device.2) To allow the flexibility, a thin ribbon cable runs internally from the male to female end. Within a first few tries, I was finding the ribbon cable was getting pinched between parts not allowing a full 90 degrees of movement and damaging the ribbon cable.Due to the price, I will use this a bit more but expect due the poor design construction, it will have a short life span.Recommendation: do not buy this device."
2,Works great for awhile,"This multi angle device works great for about a month, then it quits. Great idea, but the execution is less than you would hope for."
2,Could be made stronger.,To flimsy. It was great up until one of the little ears broke off where it pivots. I hot glued it into the position I want and there it will stay. The pivot joint ears should be made wider and stronger.
1,trash,"lasts for a short time but sooner or later, it will stop functioning. i was using it for a usb wifi dongle on a desktop machine and was not constantly adjusting it. once i positioned the dongle the way i wanted it, i left it there. a couple months later, i noticed that particular desktop constantly dropping its connection. after removing the flexusb adapter, everything worked just fine. when i looked closer i noticed that the internal cable was pinching. i assume that having sit in a right angle position for so long, the cable had simply worn out."
2,Easily breaks,The plastic at the joint easily comes apart and unhinges itself from the bottom section. I wish I would have gotten a fixed right angle USB instead. It is still usable just really annoying when it comes unhinged.
1,It does not work anymore after a month.,"It did work for a while, then stop working.Computer does not recognize it.I am going to return it."
2,Fragile hinge,Plastic hinge parts. A hinge arm with the hinge pin at the tip broke far too easily. It does though continue to work. The wiring is intact.
4,Great for your USB AirCard,I have Sprint AirCard that does not bend. It stick out flat and easy to get snag. I buy this FlexUSB connector and angle up 45 degree. It looks good and get better signal too. It does not get on the way or get snag on the side of the laptop usb port. It will be nice if it can be improve by make it lock more securely than wiggle bit. Overall I like it very much. I cannot find this unit anywhere locally only online store and great price too.
2,Not What I Wanted,"I use a little netbook when I'm traveling. The USB ports on the netbook are very close to the front, getting in my way a lot of the time. I got this little gadget to help keep the USB add-ons out of my way. While it does move cords, the gadget itself sticks out as much as the cords did. It's only worth one star to me, but I added a star because it does work."
1,Robo-Flex Disaster,"The Flex-USB design concept turns out to be very useful, but my CablesToGo product did not last very long-I used it maybe 10 times, and the plastic housing started to crack, rendering my Flex-USB too flexible to use. I don't know if it is a generally flawed concept or if it's inferior materials used, but I do know something's up-I have another similar unit that simply gave out, though I used this one over a span of about two years.People, this is a nice unit. but I suspect that the design needs more R&D.; Until then, your money is likely better spent on bona fide USB patch cables, which accomplish the same mission of enhancing flexibility. No mechanical joint or hard plastic to give way and highly flexible by design, these cables are sold in lengths of as short as six inches, up through 1.5 feet and up to six feet long..."
4,I like it,"it is good, I like that you can switch to any position. The only think I would change is the material. It looks like a toy. I would like something more heavy duty."
5,Great package,"This is one of the best stuff i have bought at Amazon...It fits to every radio and Klimatronic described. If you posses any kind of shop or you're working with vehicles you mite need these, trust me Buy It ;)"
5,Heal Your Body,I LOVE this book! I keep buying them & giving my copy away to someone that might need/want it. I finally got around to getting it again for me and....this book is phenomenal!
3,interest,"This book was to help me change my thoughts, therefore changing my life from negative to positive. it is very enlightening, as it has positive affirmations and has a list of negative thought you need to clear. good book as it reveals life changing affirmations."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"This book is amazing, it has already helped myself and others.... Great for reference, able to carry where ever you go! Thanks Louise!"
4,Great resource............,"This book is a great resource for what you need to work on in the ""You can heal your life"" book / Audio CD and workbook.I highly recommend all the works my Louise L. Hay."
1,disappointing,Why even barther releasing this booklet. Its not of any use at all If you ask me. Just blibber blabber rubbish
1,Heal Your Body,This was a dissapointment. This basic book gives the author's ideas of causes of illness with no scientific backing. I believe it can mislead people wanting to better understand the mind-body connection.
1,Heal Your Body; The Mental Causes for Physical Illness and t,I was disappointed in this book because it didn't acknowledge the importance of the medical field. It is more a 'mind over matter' type of book. Not for me!
1,Lame!,"This is the lamest book I've ever read. I thought it would have some good insight but instead two pages of narrative, and then the rest is bogus mantras. I regret buying it, it's horrible. And partially bogus."
3,heal your body/new cover,this book is ok i didnt find it very interesting for a mature mind it lacks inthusiasm for the reader although informative.
4,helpful,"This book is very helpful in accessing mental and emotional causes for different illnesses. I have bought it many times over and distribute it to my massage clients if they show interest in the subject. I tell my clients to read up on their various conditions and if the answer resonates with them, they can use the affirmations given."
4,Heal Your Body,I got a lot of unexpected insight from the different aliments I have been experiencing from looking at the categories. I have definately been challenged to grow up. Ms. J
4,Heal your body,I bought this book as a gift to a sick friend. I do love this author so I thought that this book could help her. I have not hear from my friend yet.
5,A MUST have book!!!,"This book has been a source of help to myself and family for many years. I have purchased many copies. I usually loan it out, never to be seen again. Everyone that sees it wants a copy of it. Invaluable and so very accurate. Truly a must have book!"
3,Heal Your Body,I was a little disappointed because the book is filled with positive affirmations that I attempted to use on myself but I couldn't tell any difference after a good faith effort (3 months regularly said)
2,Is it helpful????,"I am expecting a lot more information and at least some suggested steps for the readers who are seeking to Heal The Body. I am disappointed that from page 10-80 (83 pages) is listing the problems in alphabetical order and the probable causes in a few words and the new thought patterns. You don't get healed with a couple lines of suggestions. If you look for something with depth, this is not the book."
3,Great Little Read,"Not a lot of content to this book, but the information it did share was insightful. I liked the healing affirmations, but prefer the ""I can do it!"" book by Louise Hay, as it is filled with positive affirmations."
2,Really!,"This book is childish and for those who have not developed much with their inner growth.A beginners step, quickly left behind"
5,In my opinion...,"An excellent game with exciting combat, nice music, and a great plot. I did find the controls odd at first, but I got used to it once I chose a different configuration. I highly recommend this game."
2,Oni...nope,okay...I played this game and decided to take it back after the second day and get another game. Thank goodness I had bought it used. I don't think it was hard to learn how to control her in the training missions...it just made it wierd to try to aim and move and shoot with the analog sticks. I just didn't like the controls...plus the fact of this beeing my first PS2 game it didn't meet with graphical expections or desires. I went and bought sky odyssey and found it to be a much better game. You want a fighting game try Onimusha Warlords or Dynasty Warriors both are great.
4,Enjoyable!,"I'm right in the middle of ONI, and I'm really enjoying it. Yes, the controls do take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's great. My only beef with the game is that sometimes the walls aren't solid and the combatants can actually fight through a wall or a closed door. The main character is fun to control and great fun to watch. The storyline is enough to keep me interested. Maybe it's not ""A Tale of Two Cities"" but it has enough in it so that I want to see what happens next. There are some challenging parts in the game, but for 50 bucks, it's a challenge I'm looking for! If the games were too easy, I'd have a new game every few days and end up broke. All things considered, I'd recommend Oni to anyone. (Except the people who wrote negative reviews. I don't think they'd appreciate it.)"
5,Oni For Sony,"This one of the sweetest games I've ever seen for Playstation One or Two. The game utilizes one of the most high-tech combanation of arrow, analog, symboles, rights, and lefts for any game on any system. Not only that, but the combanation of wepons and hand to hand fighting make it somewhat of a stratigy game. The graphics are intense, the wepons fanaminal, and the plot (from what i have so far seen) is well thougt out. It could easily rate ""PS2 Game of the Year."""
3,I Though It Was Going To Be Better.... :(,"This game (I thought) was going to be an action packed thriller with the best storyline to buy. Though, when I played it, It is an action packed game. Not really a thriller and NOT a good storyline. It has seventeen levels and once you get to each one it gets more boring and boring. Though, I would reccomend not to buy this, but to rent it because there's really no thrill in playing a boring bought game more than once. Beating it once was only for me, so It was sorta a waste of money for me to buy this. I especially love playing a game more than once. Like Resident Evil and Silent Hill are two games that are fun to play even more than twice. So rent this game, don't buy it..."
5,One of the best Games I've played to Date,"Its just one of those games that suck you in to where you lose track of time it is worth the 50 bucks, its a shame games are so expensive but if your gunna fork out the dough this one is really worth it, if you like Real games"
3,It's alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllright,"I was really hyped up about Oni when I first read about it back in September. After playing it I felt real disaponited. First it's the controls. Man, they are hard to get used to. I spent most of the time dying because of these controls. Second, its the graphics. They look plain and doesn't feel like a next gen game. The story line is pretty good and deep. I would recommend that you rent this game first before buying it."
3,Oni,"This is a fun game and kicks... Oni has a lot of fighting moves and the game has great 3D graphics. Though, I personally find one major drawback in this game are the camera angles - the camera always stays at the same distance behind Oni causing the walls of a room to get in the way and block the view of what is happening. As a result many times when I'm fighting an opponent and I can't see what I'm doing. This is a flaw that needn't be."
2,Siphon Filter nock off,"For any of you that have already played siphon filter for the PS1 then I will suggest you go back and play it instead of reading my review of this game. As many of you have already guessed Oni has the same general game play and feel as the aforementioned game. Additional control was added to give the player more things to worry about during game play but otherwise not much has changed mechanically. Now as for the storyline this game presents a classic, or should I say transparent, plot that does not develop into anything worthwhile. Each level is more of the same thing with the foreshadowing functioning as subtly as a herd of elephants. In short this game could only be redeemable if it had come out on the PS1. There is no evidence of the capability, or the price tag, that has become associated with PS2 titles.I would recommend renting this game instead of purchasing it. There is little to no replay value and the plot will not keep a player interested for long."
1,More trouble than it's worth...,"I thought this would be one of the coolest games out for the PS2 right now. And in some respects, that's true. However, as a seasoned veteran of game systems, this is probably the hardest game to control I have EVER played. It's a rare thing for me to get so angry at video game. DOn't let the fluidity of Konoko's motion to confuse the issue... You can't control her. It's difficult to get used to using both analog sticks top control movement, aim weapons, and look around. That coupled with too many enemies that attack in groups will frustrate you. It's really awful to be having your tail kicked and not be able to even find who's got their foot in you rear. I found Oni to be a complete frustrating waste of time and money."
1,"Thanks, Rockstar!","Rockstar, the developers of this awful game, sure have been pumping out the PS2 games. Smuggler's Run was fun and all, but this is just too bad. It fails in every way that a game can. The visuals are sub-par (PSOne games look 10x better than this), it controls like a cow, and the actual gameplay is repetitive and a chore to play. Not worth your time."
2,Knock off done ...!,"Imagine Jet For Gemeni (n64) for PS2 with bad graphics and horrible controls. You need one stick to steer side to side and look up and down, while using the other to side-step and move forward? Then to make things worse, they don't even let you change it. Control ..., gameplay is stolen, and graphics aren't really up to par. Think twice before getting this overhyped ...-fest."
1,Hands down the worst game I have ever played,"Don't be fooled by the seemingly positive reviews that ... seems to give this game. The thing that realy does this game in is the extremly awkward controls. I'm sure they were trying to be inovative by coming up with a new way of doing things but in the end the game is supposed to be fun, and it isn't fun dying every 10 min because you couldn't accuratly turn around and hit the guy behind you. Add this in with a ""been there, done that"" storyline and you have a game you definetly can do without. This game is so bad that I rented it, only played for two days, forgot I had it and ended up having to pay the late fee when I didn't return it in time."
3,"Good story, odd controls, decent playability....","I'm a hardcore fan of action martial arts style games. When I saw ONI I had to get it. At first, I was dissapointed by the controls, but they don't take horribly long to get used to. If you use the pad and the right analog stick, it's not that hard to control. I didn't feel that there was enough mixture in martial arts moves or weapons. And fighting the same enemies over and over get's boring after a while. And the more complex moves, were usually near impossible to pull off when you REALLY need them to. Throws were pretty much useless in actual combat unless you were lucky enough to get one off. And the ending was somewhat of a letdown. But despite it's bad points, it is a very well done game, storywise. But replay value is low. Decent to own, but not recommended to buy. A good weekend renter though."
3,"Not the best replay value, but cool game.","My twelve year old son bought this game. After renting it, he just HAD to have it. Now for him to use his allowance to buy this game told me how much he enjoyed it.Many missions seem to be near impossible to complete without the cheat codes. And the ending is set to either end there, yet has the option of being continued. I guess the makers want to see how the public reacts.Not one to be replayed and replayed, but it will keep you busy for about a month."
2,ONI NOOOOOOOOOO....)0'.,"I love 3rd person action games, but ONI is NOT one of PS2's shining moments. first off the graphics are very DULL, there is no kewl storyline, as opposed to syphon filter, tomb raider resident evil ETC. and The controls really suck, especially for a action game. waayyy too many button schemes.This is a blatant ghost in the shell wannabe, and not for TRUE ANIME fans. (you know who you are..) if i had a choice i would rather buy EA's X Sqaud. it may be a lil' simplistic, but you'll get your $$ worth. i would pass on ONI and save ($) more to buy a DREAMCAST. iv'e seen much better games on SEGA's dying platform than the much hyped PS2.BUYER BEWARE.. Rent ONI, b4 you buy!!"
1,this game is worst than going 2 school,oni is the word boring it suks so muchbad graphics you spend 30 minutes just learning how 2 walki bought it in amazon it onli cost me 5 pounds like $9 stillis not worth no dimeplz dont buy this game u will thank me later
4,"It's fun, but no garentees that you'll like it","A lot of people gave Oni a bad review, including some magazines. There were also many good reviews. The truth is I can't tell you if you'll like it or not, it all depends on your preference. The entire game is interesting. The story is great if you love anime. The weapons are unique and fun, but there is no real depth to the weapon system. That's because you can only have one at a time. Ammo is limited. The best thing in this game is the innocent civilians that beg for heir life when you beat on them. The surroundings are monotonous and bland. That can be changed by using the glassworld code, everything shatters when shot at. The controls aren't beautiful, but can be dealt with after awhile. The codes are fun and add re-play value. After beating the game you might just say it's worth your money, I guess. Multiplayer could've been great. Graphics could've been much better too. If you don't like sports games, then get it."
3,"A good game, but impossible to beat","Oni for the PC is a great game. But for the PS2, some of the thrill is gone. The gameplay is the same, but the controls are lousy. Generally, when you turn left or right you will accidentally nudge the joystick so that you look up or down at an angle that makes it hard for you to shoot. Level 3 is almost impossible to beat because of the [weak] controls. Another problem is the lack of ammo. You get very little to start, and the villians you kill have a very small chance of giving you anything. If you buy this, I'd spend the extra money and get it for PC. The game is exactly the same, but the controls are ever so much better..."
2,Too Much Trouble for the Money.,"Oni was way, way too difficult to control. I found I had to set all of the controls to my own ways because otherwise there would be no way I would ever get through it. The only real value to the game is that is good looking and has a lot of freedom. Unfortunately, the effort to give you freedom gave the game ... controls. The game also lacked originality and a sense of adventure that I hoped would come with it. Instead, it was a game where if you were patient in playing it enough you could get through it. I think if this was the first version of the game, as the manufacturer I would be pleased, but would have long conversations on how to improve it. As a result, look elsewhere to spend your bucks."
1,Screen protector,"This company offers overpriced screens and is unresponsive and unfriendly to customers who have a problem. If you want a less expensive screen protector of simiilar quality, try Clarivue."
2,Well I thought it would protect my screen,"Sure it keeps keystains from occurring (brought about from oils from your fingers transferring to the screen)but now I have permanent blotches on my display because something got spilled on the Marware pad at some point. Myself and the Apple store ""genius"" deduced this, as the staining is external, and not internal.Marware could avoid this problem by making the pad a lighter color (so that you can see if it got wet or coffee'd) and/or putting some sort of teflon coating onto the surface. Right now the pads are a very neutral gray color that hides any trace of liquid.In the meantime, I have a 3 month old MacBook Pro with a blotchy screen. I paid an obscene amount for this machine, only to have the screen all but ruined by a $10 piece of wetsuit material (what this pad apears to be made from)"
4,Sound Explosion,The speaker is great. It is the hardest hitting speaker I have installed into a system. I know in time the rear end of my sons's truck will fall apart from the vibrations.
1,Overpriced and you can get better for cheaper,"All the people reviewing this sub have to be noobs and over exaggerating on how loud they are.Dont get me wrong this is not a bad subwoofer at all,but you're just paying for the name.The same performance can be had at a cheaper price from underground companies like Fi,DC Audio,AA etc.I personally would rather have my subs built on order than to have mass produced subs just sitting on shelves collecting dust.I've owned one of these when I first got into car audio and I thought they were loud,and sounded awesome,but as I got deeper into car audio I realized that these were'nt the cream of the crop.My Fi Q 12 outperforms the w7 12 in every way (SQ,andSPL)and got it for half the price.So before investing in this sub that puts out only 1k wrms (like seriously)for near 600 bucks just remember that there's better for the price.Save yourself some money and invest into the brands listed above you won't regret it."
1,UPDATE: FORGET IT,DO NOT BY OVERPRICED JL EQUIPMENT> HAD A 12W7 and a JL HD1200 AMP< BOTH ARE GARBAGE AND HAVE MULTIPLE ISSUES> WHEN YOU CONTACT STEVE AT JL AUDIO HE WILL GIVE YOU 50 EXCUSES WHY JL DOESNT WORK IN CARS. APPARENTLY THERES A CHASSIS PROBLEM WITH CARS. GO WITH FOSGATE YOU WILL NOT LOSE>
2,DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE,I bought this thinking that I could make wonderful angel hair pasta with zucchini. Wrong. The shreds are so fine that they are only good for garnishing. After putting pesto onto the zucchini it turned into mush. I then tried carrots. Carrots are VERY difficult to do. You must put ALL your weight on it and turn. The shreds are great for garnishing a salad but I can do the same thing with a hand shredder that I already have. I tried apples since my kids wanted to play with it and they didn't have the strength to do the carrots. The apples turned into mush.I am now looking for a horizontal type slicer that I saw in a Japanese store. Don't bother with this one.
2,Find another spiral slicer,"I was so excited to buy this product, but it is a pain to operate. The turning handle operation doesn't always turn the produce, it sort of just mashes it. We've found that the best way to slice the produce using this is to take off the lid and just manually feed the vegies in - it's a pain."
1,Overpriced Hunk of Plastic,"Why hasn't someone made this product in stainless steel? This spiral slicer is the worst piece of equipment I have in my kitchen. Besides emitting a nasty plastic smell, it's cheap and flimsy. It only works (kind of) on soft veggies which is not useful in the raw foodie world. This is an item I would expect to see in Chinatown for a few bucks. Too bad that's not the case; that's all it's worth. Save your money and buy elsewhere."
5,Thought Provoking and Clear; A Must Read!,"This book should be given to every believer, new or not-so-new, young or old. It helps explain the many questions a Christian deals with, bringing up fears and doubts that many may have feared to admit. Grounded in Scripture, the clear writing style makes this book accessible to anyone, and yet manages to avoid the ""dumbing down"" that this reader has (sadly) come to expect in the Christian world. Questions regarding faith, failures, fears, trials, forgiveness, works, and God's magnificent grace are all dealt with and explained in a comprehensible manner. All I could complain about is that this is the only book he has available. ""Give us more! I want a series, Mr. Julian!"
1,Lacking,This is really not a book of dreams at all. It has informationabout monthly horoscopes and a place to record your dreams.It doesn't offer any interpretation. I don't recommend it.
5,Good Mystery Series,"While trying to figure out the murderer, the reader is exposed to real characters which you can identify with. I sometimes find myself laughing out loud."
5,A fine whodunnit in the heather for the highland's finest...,"Death descends into the quiet highland village of Lochdubh once again when a muckraking t.v. presenter is found dead in her car just outside of town. It looks like a suicide but police constable Hamish Macbeth thinks differently and sets off to prove otherwise. Nothing comes easy in the highlands, though, and the more he digs into the crime, the more he discovers that many people had motive to murder....This book is the quintessential Hamish Macbeth: sharp, witty, brooding, and oh-so-unlucky at love. Beaton offers up the most well-rounded Macbeth mystery ever, propelling her quirky (but nicely defined) characters along a briskly paced plot that's as warm as a wee dram o' whiskey."
5,Another Great Hamish!,"This is honestly one of my very favourite series, and each book is just as enjoyable as the last. I'm only sad that I'm getting to the end of the series, and hope that M.C. Beaton continues to write for a good long while yet. Hamish is a wonderful character and the eccentric people in his little village of Lochdubh are so real, that it seems they are actually real people. In this book we meet two new characters that I hope to see more of - Elspeth, who seems to be a wonderful romantic interest for the died-in-the-wool Bachelor, Hamish and Inspector Carson who takes the place of the odious Blair when murder of famous television celebrities occurs in and around Lochdubh. Again Hamish is thrown into a murder investigation in his quiet little village, and before he, Elspeth and Carson can solve it a few more deaths occur. For anyone who likes their mysteries cozy, with a definite wicked comic appeal, you cannot go wrong with Hamish Macbeth."
4,Cozy in Scotland,"Another entertaining Hammish MacBeth mystery. This time television personalities are being murdered and Hamish helps his supervisor and the CID to investigate. He also has a little help Elspeth who seems to have some physic abilities. There also seems to be a little romance starting to develop between Hamish and Elspeth. So, on to the next Hamish adventure."
4,Great background music,"This is beautiful music, based on classical sounds but with a modern flare. There's less of a rock beat here than in the music the group played when I heard them at Disney's EPCOT, making this CD less exciting but, on the other hand, better for background music for a dinner."
1,"A poor follow-up to ""The Koreans""","I hate to give this book just one star as I really enjoy Michael Breen's writing and humor. His first book, ""The Koreans"", is the best book on the South Korean people I've ever read and I was eagerly anticipating this book, hoping it would complement the first book. Unfortunately, it is mainly a compilation of other books with a couple of personal notes from an old trip or two Breen made to North Korea prior to the famine of the 1990s. If you read ""Aquariums of Pyongyang"" by Kang Chol-Hwan and ""The Great North Korean Famine"" by Natsios, you will have basically read this book as well.For the best information on North Korea and its people, ""North Korea: Through the Looking Glass"" by Kong Dan Oh is probably still the best book to read."
1,Horrible and ill-informed,"I purchased this book with the intent of providing some back ground on Kim Jong-Il as I was reading his official North Korean biography, and foolishly thought this would be one additional perspective.I was wrong. This book essentially culls common western thought about Kim Jong-Il, references his state biography a few times and repeats many things from the press without note. Poor writing compounds. The only thing of interests were his personal experiences, which are fairly rare from North Korea and did shed some light.Overall, one would be better off reading Bruce Cuming's work on North Korea, either his book Behind Closed Doors or his excellent survey history Korea's Place in the Sun."
3,piano e forte,"This could be the greatest recording of the last century for all I know, but a consistent volume was impossible to achieve with the soft sections so recessed and the loud sections so prominent. I couldn't hear two-thirds of the damned thing. Difficult to appeciate these works' sublimity, annoyed as I was by having to turn the volume up and down."
3,Not the best...,"I got this game today, I'd have to say it's not the worst game I've played; but it's not the best, either! I did not expect to see what I played today; but it's still fun. I would only recommend this game to children who have chosen this and it's the first game they've gotten.Update on 7/1/09: 4 Stars for fun."
4,A great Read,If you like gothic romances you will love this book it has a little bit of everything for everyone.(ghosts curses ect) The characters in this book were well developed and the story line was strong. I read this in one reading. (i just could not seem to put it down. I would recommend this book!
5,The shadowing,"Wow, what a book. I was drawn in to the story almost immediately. Ms. Overfield created an atmosphere of suspense, excitement without losing literary style. I had almost given up on romances being exciting and unpredictable (except the end of course), but now I will look forward to hearing more from this writer."
3,A Gothic Romance worth 3 1/2 *'s,"This book was good but I felt that the author did not take advantage and follow through with all of the plot lines that were introduced. There was so much that could have been better explained sooner in the book such as the concept of ""the shadowing"", the importance of the aromory, and the character Beecham. Otherwise the book was good. The things that I mentioned did not deter terribly from the story it would have just made it in my opinion a 5* book instead.The love story between Anne and Ruairdh is strong and believable. Gothic in nature with plenty of mystery and pain as well as the brooding dark handsome hero kept me reading."
4,Enjoyable,"""Shadowing"" by Joan Overfield is a gothic which tells the story of a man, the last of his line, who is living with curse that has been passed down the line for about 400 years. It takes the love a special lady to lift the shadows from his soul. He's not the only one who benefits though, she's been living with her own sort of curse in the form of a demanding, cantankerous father who treats her like dirt.This was an interesting, engrossing read and fresh in a gothic sorta way."
2,Not All That Easy,"After reading glowing reviews of Easyseat I was most anxious to try it. After 50 miles of constant adjustments, I'm ready to give up. I ache in places I didn't ache previously. I'm sore in places that weren't sore before. I average 40-50 miles per week, and the Easyseat is causing that average to drop drastically. I can't suffer more than 8 miles per ride with this mis-named product, and I'm forced to skip every other day because of the soreness. I'm trying to be patient and give the seat every chance to live up to the glowing reviews. My patience is wearing thin."
3,Crazy,"This seat was on a used bicycle I bought. The older fellow I bought it from went on and on and on about how great this seat was. He obviously liked it very well. I thought it was incredibly funny-looking, but since I had it and it was like new, I figured I'd try it. I sat on it. I hated it. I tried it several times more. I still hated it. I tried it again. I hated it worse. It came off and a regular seat went on.So, what does this prove? It proves some people will like this seat and some won't. It would better to try it out first if you can.Oh, and it squeaks."
3,One problem solved; another created.,"I should reveal right from the top my EasySeat is an older model, since replaced by one with apparently larger pads and an easier width adjustment. This version of the EasySeat accomplishes what it was made to do. I can now ride the bike without turning my, um ... nuggets ... numb. That's a great improvement. But work needs to be done making those pads more comfortable. I simply can't get a 15 mile ride in without great pain in the buttocks. The sitting angle is also quite unpleasant, forcing the rider the lean hard on the handlebars at all times. The result, of course, is numb wrists. The pads are small, hard, and they don't quite fit my human posterior. I'm thinking another product might be designed better, but I don't have the first hand research to prove it."
5,Best movie ever made,"The greatest movie ever made any where in any language bar none.Sholay, and unforgiven are a distant second. Mayabazar is the only competetion for this movie. GodFather, 10 comandments will need better script, actors and make fewer artistic mistakes to compete with this classic."
3,"If not read while wrapping it in the proper historical context, the modern reader may be offended","The cartoons in this collection are very dated and sexist and would generally be considered inappropriate by modern audiences. The 1930's and 1940's were a time when it was acceptable to depict wealthy women as being terrible drivers, extremely prudish, prejudiced against all but their own kind, materialistic, unintelligent and overweight.Yet, the cartoons still remain valid as satire in some circles; on occasion there is a news story about a wealthy woman where she demonstrates a few characteristics in the previous list. If you read this book with the attitude that you are offended by sexism, then you WILL be offended. However, if you read it with the proper historical context in your mind, then you may find it humorous, or at least instructive about the way things were."
5,My #1 Recommendation,I love Sanaya Roman and Orin. This book is my number 1 recommendation for people wanting to understand the Law of Attraction and how to attract abundance in their life. I first read this book 20+ years ago and still think it's the best. I use the techniques and tools for creating my own abundance. I know they work.
1,Are you kidding me,"People have actually bought this nonsense. I've got a better idea. Send me the cost of the book and I'll wave my magic wand over your money and watch it disappear into my bank account. How's that for ""channelling"". Please don't waste money and time on this ridiculous crap. You want more money?? Live within your means and cut up your credits cards?"
1,Channel Garbage,"This book has absolutely nothing to do with business management or ownership and is total nonsense. It should be catagorized with eastern mysticism and the occult. If you are seeking truth, look somewhere else. I will not recommend this book to anyone. Because of the totally false claims presented about this book, I will attempt to return it for a full refund."
5,"It is concrete and specific, and it works.","It is one of the most helpful books I have ever read. It has enabled me to have the house of my dreams. It brings peace in a world where success is often equated to winning a rat race. It brings a sense of true power over material concerns, freeing you to pursue your Life's Work. It teaches how to attract money, but more importantly, it teaches you how to find happiness and deep-felt satisfaction. Buy it."
5,An incredibly helpful book. Miracles are possible.,"You're missing out if you let the channeling new-age thing stop you from reading this book. It has helped me numerous times in the past few years. I have written down my intentions and asked for a large sum of money, and I received that much and more. A must have for anyone interested in creating wealth, abundance, and happiness."
4,A great historical view of early Texas.,This book was recommended to me by a Border Patrol agent in Texas when I asked him to elaborate on the history of the Border Patrol and The Texas Rangers. It's written from the viewpoint of one who was there though a good bit is probably the result of an inflated Igo.
4,NICE GRILL COVER,"The quality and features of the grill cover are a good.The sizing is generous and the vents help keep it in place.The storage pocket in the front is good for average grill items.I wish the tie down strap was about 10 inches longer to hold the cover tigher. If you are tired of the cracked plastic covers or the sticky white backing, you will like this cover, it breaths."
5,Great Service,I have been looking for the movie for years! So happy to have found it! Arrived prompt and in excellent condition. I couldn't be happier! Will buy from this vendor again!
1,"Five star movie, zero star copy","In my minds eye I have retained this film in all its boisterous, hilarious, non-political correct fun!The available copies of this film, however, suck.I will pay $50 for a decent DVD copy of this gem."
5,John Wayne at his funnest!,"The story of a middle aged rancher who's wife has left him for reasons he doesn't know; who's only child, a beautiful daughter, has just graduated from college; who's rival, a pompus ..., has a large group of homesteaders heading for land that can't be farmed; who's old enemies, the local Indian Chiefs, are being released from Federal custody and he is trying to get a large shipment of cattle to market. This movies is a tour de force with John Wayne and Mureen O'Hara giving us great comedy proformances. The fight sence between Wayne and the homesteaders is a movie classic.It is a must see!!!"
2,don't like,I just recieved the DVD and watched it - I DON'T LIKE the picture. The movie itself is great but the quality of the picture and sound is bad. Disappointed!
2,Do not purchase this DVD version!,"I tried two different players, it wouldn't play on one and played poorly on the other. The quality on the one that would play it was very poor. A very poor reproduction. The video was dark and the audio was poor as well. It looked like a hijacked version. I sent it back and Amazon replaced it, but the problem was also in the second disk.I returned the second disk as well and the Amazon credited my account for both disks. I was satisfied with Amazon's response, but disappointed with the product, because I'm a big John Wayne fan."
2,Not great,"I watched this movie frequently as a kid and loved it so i decided to buy it, the quality on most of it is good but it seemed like they cut scenes from different versions so some of the picture it poor. i would not recommend this, i would look for a different version like a anniversary copy."
1,quality lacks,"We were disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The picture quality was lousy. In some places it was downright blurry. In this day of computerization, I would think the movie could've been ""updated"" as so many others have been. When our eyes started crossing, we decided to stop watching it. We were sorry we spent our money on it."
1,Poor Quality Picture,"""Good Times"" video is terrible. The quality looks like it was filmed from a picture playing in a theater. Color is bad and there are lots of lines in the picture."
1,An awful shame,"This movie is (usually) a great way to spend a lighthearted evening. However, the production quality of this disc is so abysmally bad that it is difficult to enjoy the movie. I certainly wouldn't spend the money on it again. I would rather watch it on AMC, bowflex and dietary supplement commercials, notwithstanding."
3,Mediocre quality,"This is a great movie, of course, but the quality of the DVD leaves a LOT to be desired. The picture can be very blurry, and will sometimes zoom for no apparent reason onto nothing very important. It's odd. It's probably better just to get this on video."
4,It's About Time!,"John Wayne's funniest film has finally been given the royal treatment: a brilliantly sharp, colorful, widescreen picture with clear sound, commentary, and some fun extras. It was great to see Maureen O'Hara again--she looks wonderful! To the person who couldn't find the trailer and the corset feature, they are there, on a second page. Nothing is missing; it's a wonderful DVD."
1,Should Have Read Reviews,"Boy, do I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this DVD. I love this story, but the video quality is so poor as to take away from the enjoyment of the movie. Far too many scenes are out of focus or the color is off. It would be nice if the original producer of this movie would put it out on DVD, because I would jump at the chance to replace this piece of [trash]"
3,GREAT MOVIE BAD DVD,A great movie put on dvd badly. They even clipped a small section where they kid Mrs McLintock about the color of her hair. Someday they will make a dvd with evtras but for now settle for this because it is a great movie!!!
3,movie = 4* picture quality =2*,"I like this movie quite a bit and find it humours and sentimental in many ways. The DVD picture quality was very poor, to the point of distraction.Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne are like flint and steel, when they get together watch out the sparks are going to fly. Stephanie Powers is recognizable as their daughter and the rest of the actors and actresses are well cast. The plot though thin is kept lively by the antics of the whole town. I'm not sure we ever really find out what the burr is under Katie's saddle when it comes to McIntock. I think she just forgets from whence she came and he didn't."
1,Could've told you...,"When McClintock (my fave Wayne movie, by the way) came out on VHS, there was a big controversy because ""Goodtime"" video released it in such bad shape. About a week after they released it, John Wayne's son who had produced the movie, said that Goodtime had released it without his permission. He then released a much better version. BOTTOM LINE: DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM GOODTIME, ESPECIALLY THIS MOVIE. HOPE THAT WAYNE'S SON WILL RELEASE HIS VERSION ON DVD!!"
1,"""Great movie, but buy the vhs""","First thing I need to say is that this rating is NOT based on the film itself. This is a wonderul, charming funny movie. However, the quality of this dvd is very poor. There are lines that move through the picture occasionally, there are bits of lint and dirt (like in a movie theatre),the sound is not always crisp, the film quality itself is sometimes fuzzy and unclear. I would highly recomend taping the remastered version off of TNT when it comes on, or buying the vhs version ( I believe it's better, but not having purchased it myself I would be careful before I buy). I do hope that they will re-release this movie onto dvd in its remastered format. If they do, it's worth the wait, pass on this one."
2,Good movie. Bad DVD.,"I love this move. In fact, this is probably my favorite JW movie besides ""The Cowboys."" I hate the DVD transfer! The quality looks like it was recorded straight from the old film reels without any restoration at all. I have seen much beter quality versions on tape and even TV. If you really want this DVD, then get it because it is fairly cheap, but remember, you get what you pay for."
2,BAD COPY,"This particular product (not the authorized version) of the was a very grainy copy, the copy was blotchy like it had been posterized. Also several scenes are missing."
1,Only buy the authorized version,"This movie is my family's favorite. I have been watching it since I was born and can practically quote it line for line. However here is a word to the wise: DO NOT BUY THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION. It will ruin it for you if you have not seen it before, and gravely disappoint you if you have. The unauthorized version is a waste of $10, or however much you paid for it."
1,"Great Movie, Horrible DVD Read Reviews","While this is one of my all time favorites I made the mistake of not reading the reviews of the product. Horrible video transfer. Stay away, do not buy."
2,Inferior McLintock DVD,Unfortunatly this DVD is poor quality. The sound track doesn't always match the mouths of actors and there is a shadow or double image particularly in the beginning. I was very disapointed. Thinking of returning this DVD.Bird Lady
2,McLINTOCK,Always loved the movie but this recording was cheaply dubbed from a bad vhs tape. There are different versions to buy so save your money and your eyes.
2,Great movie - miserable copy - fuzzy and not wide screen.,"A very good slapstick western for John Wayne fans. Moves quickly with lots of action. Unfortunately, this DVD is as poor in quality as the Good Times VHS version. It is not the Wayne estate authorized version - which is much better."
3,hmmm,this was supposed to be a gift for my husband i only wanted the movie mclintock but i got two movies one that we never heard of i love the movie not to sure about the service
1,Horrible quality,"We just got this the other day - really looked forward to watching it. My husband & I are big fans of the movie. It was such a letdown. Our old VHS copy is a better quality than this DVD. We thought that the DVD version would be much clearer and better sound quality. That couldn't have been further from the truth. We're very disappointed, and quite frankly disappointed that Amazon is even selling this DVD. Don't waste your money - worst quality DVD I've ever seen."
1,Great film incompetantly copied onto dvd,"The distributors should have waited for a digital re-mastering of ""Mclintock!"". The film itseld s a classic Wayne O'Hara go-round but my old VHS tape is better quality. On this dvd scenes are scratchy and out of focus, color fades, audio sequencing is out of alignment, and many scenes are ineptly centered, just showing blank sets with the characters off the screen entirely.The distributors should have waited for professional digitalization rather than a below acceptable transfer from a degrading copy. Affecionados of this and other classics should insist on quality remastering and not poor copies from old tape. This flim deserves to be viewed in widescreen or letterbox format."
2,Would Have Been FIVE Stars!,"I saw this movie in the theatre when I was a kid and enjoyed it immensely. During a visit to the States, I bought a VHS copy marketed by GoodTimes (blue box with picture of Wayne jumping down). It was a big letdown. The picture quality was atrocious. It was blurry at times, the color too much enhanced, and the film scratches too many. It was like watching a worn out film. In these times of refurbishing old movies to bring out the original feel, I didn't expect this product. This movie would have definitely been five stars if presented cleanly. I heard that the Wayne estate authorized version is a good copy. But since that is not generally available, this version will have to do for a John wayne fan."
5,Good disc.,"Who doesn't like John Wayne? It came quickly and was packaged nice. The case is not flimsy and the disc seems to be a quality disc, as is the case. The movie has played well over 3 times w/o any mishaps and a very good picture."
4,Mclintock,"While this is an older movie,it is a very good one that will entertain people even today. If you are a John Wayne or a Maureen O'Hara fan this movie is a must!"
1,Example of Poor Tape Quality Wrecking a Good Movie,"This is the GoodTimes Home Video VHS. It looks like it was recorded in the back of a movie theatre with a guy holding a camcorder, then copied, packaged and sent them out. There are white vertical lines, white dots, color changes and words don't line with lips sometimes. (It's not my vcr!!! The Searchers movie is awesome as well as my other 60+ home videos) I do like the movie, (I always have) Good John Wayne quotes as always. This is more of a comedy role for John Wayne with wild west flavor. But don't buy this version of tape by this company..find another!!!"
2,avoid buying,"I'm a woman that likes John Wayne movies. You can get sets of John Wayne movies for the same price or less than for this movie, which is sub-par anyway. I'd avoid buying this and look into some other options to get your John Wayne fix."
3,McLintock!,"This was a fun movie when I was young, and still is. It really is pretty sexist by today's standards, but still enjoyable to watch."
1,"Terrible transfer to DVD--poor image quality, no letterbox.","This is a fine John Wayne film but much of it is missing in this DVD version. This film appears to have been transferred to DVD by simply capturing the center 4:3 portion of the picture. I don't know what the original aspect ratio of the film was, but there are a very noticeable number of scenes on this DVD in which the actors' faces are not visible because they are off the edge of the screen. In other words, they didn't use pan-and-scan. In addition, the image quality is not too good. I noticed what seemed to be grainy artifacts from the video compression process. Some scenes were out of focus. This could have been from the original film but I doubt it. The film this DVD was transferred from is very scratched. I hope there is a better copy of the film around and that a real DVD manufacturer makes a quality letterboxed version."
1,I wish I'd read the reviews first,"I purchased the DVD of McLintock about two months ago. I wish I'd read the other reviews here on Amazon.com before I did. This movie is one of my favorite John Wayne films. The other DVD's in my collection have been played many times. The picture and sound quality of the DVD version of McLintock was so poor that I could barely stand the first viewing. I was very disappointed.Needless to say I wish I could return it, but it has been longer than 30 days. I wasn't fast enough. I guess I'll just hold onto it for use as a ""Frisbee"" disc. Save your money. DON'T BUY THIS DVD.I hope the ""Official"" release of this film happens soon. I'd love to add this title to my collection."
1,McLintock,"The movie is good if not great but the problem was on the GoodTimes video transfer. The quality of the movie in the transfer was horrible. At times the picture was ok, but most of the time is was fuzzy and the soundtrack lagged some. I also have the John Wayne movie ""El Dorado"" on DVD but not a GoodTimes rendition and the quality of that DVD is excellent. While I recommend the movie McLintock I do not recommend this GoodTimes version. Do not waste the money on this one."
1,The movie is not complete !!,"My main criticism of all the DVD versions of this movie is that there are lines that are missing. How this happens astounds me but I know the movie well and thankfully have kept an old VHS copy that is complete. The most notable exception is the scene where Maureen O'Hara bursts in on him playing chess and Birnbaum comments her hair looks a different shade. John Wayne laughs and says he is right, she did color her hair. Why cant they transfer a movie without cutting it up? All of John Wayne's movies need authorized editions that have been remastered badly!"
5,One of the better John Wayne motion pictures,"I would note that people who buy cheap Asian knockoffs from an unknown source should not write Amazon reviews that criticize the quality. This review is for the authorized DVD as listed on Amazon. If you have another version, please save your complaints for some other Forum.This is one of the better John Wayne motion pictures. The character McLintock is an older rancher who has a charitable attitude. He is friends with Indian chiefs, even though they tried to kill each other earlier in their lives. He warns homesteaders that land is not suitable for farming, and hires one young man who needs to support his mother and sister. He has a problem with his wife for reasons not given, and a daughter who just returned from college back east. The story holds your interest as he deals with Indians, homesteaders, his wife, and his daughter. He is an environmentalist of sorts who plans to leave most of his ranch to the government to use as a park."
2,Only Good Point,"I bought this exact DVD before the official version came out. Yes, the picture and sound quality is terrible, BUT the only good point about this particular DVD is that it's in the Widescreen version. I expected this cheapie to be pan & scan TV screen type, but someone at this 3rd rate outfit that put this out must have had some good taste to have released it in at least the widescreen format. But if you're expecting top notch DVD quality from this, well I've some swamp land I'd like to sell you."
2,"Excellent Movie, Extremely Poor Video/Audio Quality DVD","McClintock! is an excellent John Wayne Western, lots of laughs, and of course nothing beats the chemistry that John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara bring to the screen. Sadly however, the quality of this DVD is extremely poor, making it difficult to enjoy. A VHS copy of a TV airing of McClintock! would be better than what you get on this DVD! Lots of scratchy sections, poor focus, and audio volume keeps dropping out."
1,Mclintock--DVD,I have the video and the DVD for this movie. My copy of the DVD is horrible. Goodtimes replicated the DVD and it has lines and blurriness throughout. I am a John Wayne fanatic and was very disappointed in the DVD. The video I have is by MPI and it is in much better shape then the DVD. If you plan to buy this movie...WAIT until someone does it right!!
2,Movie Quality,I purchased this DVD for my father for Christmas and am very disappointed in the video quality. There are lines all throughout and the picture quality is grainy. It reminds me of the old 8mm movies that we watched in school. Try another option for this classic movie.
1,McLintock,"This DVD's quality is poor at best. As for this John Wayne film, this western ranks as one of my favorites. Unfortunately you will see a better quality version of this if you wait for it to play on WTBS and then tape it with your own VCR (even if you use the oldest tape you own the quality will exceed the DVD).This DVD was a MAJOR disappointment."
2,"GREAT MOVIE, AWFUL SOUND!","Words cannot express how disappointed I am by the quality of this tape. Expecting the wonderful movie that so many know and love, I purchased this video only to discover on the back of the video sleeve that this is an edited version of the original. That's fine, but what these people did is unacceptable! They deleted all the original music, including background music, plus they deleted voices, and background sounds and replaced them! I could not even recognize John Wayne's drawl, (I don't think it's even his voice) and Maureen O'Hara's brogue has been replaced with the voice of someone else! On top of that, the timing is way off! I ended up turning the sound off and watching the movie in silence. Still a wonderful view, but for someone who went so far as to name her daughter ""Kathryn"" after the spirited character O'Hara plays, I am thoroughly disgusted. This change should be noted in the description for those of us who care about quality."
1,McClintock,"A very bad copy for a DVD, my VHS copy is much better. Some scenes are out of focus. Some frames are off center. I'd look for a better edition."
1,Buyer Beware,"It is a toss-up between ""McClintock!"" and ""The Quiet Man"" for our all time favorite John Wayne movie, so we were very excited to be able to order them both for our new DVD player. Re: ""McClintock!"" What a disapointment! The quality (and I use the term loosely) of this DVD, released by ""Good Times Video"" is horrible. Wait for an authorized copy, released by the studio! WE will not buy anything released by Good Times Video again."
2,Will never buy a Goodtimes Home Video again,"The movie is a great movie and it is a shame Goodtimes Home Video had to butcher it that bad(blurry,choppy,etc..). I Hope another version comes out on DVD because it deserves five stars."
4,Some DVD copies are OK!,"I love this movie, I must have watched it a dozen times.I have both the DVD and the VHS copies and the quality is as good on both, I find. However, the DVD is over 1/2 an hour shorter, so I suggest you watch the movie before the DVD. After you have done then the DVD makes sense, and it shortens some of the longer scenes, though it does cut a important scene concerning the appointment of the cook.And for those people that say it isn't politically correct, for the majority of women it isn't these days, but I am a women and I agree with the whole thing lol.This movie is good and funny, and the more you watch it the better it gets!"
2,Horrible Quality!,The movie is one of my favorites the Duke ever made. I was really excited to see it on DVD. I can't describe my disappointment and frustration as I watched it over Christmas. The recording of the movie was made from a very poor film copy. Many scenes are blurry - totally out of focus. Film scratches are continuous. Don't buy this - wait for someone else to re-master it so it's watchable!
3,"Good Movie, Bad recording","I have enjoyed this movie for years, as well as other John Wayne movies. I originally saw this on VHS and was thrilled to finally have the movie on DVD. But I was really disappointed. The recording was terrible. The picture was sometimes crystal clear, and then would be blurred and lined. My VHS recording was better and also had extended scenes that I missed in the DVD version. My recommendation would be to wait until a better version comes along."
3,Disappointing Quality,"This is one of my favorite JW movies - but the quality of this DVD was disappointing. Dialog was cut from the movie in several places and there are streaks in many of the frames throughout the film. Buy the movie, it is enjoyable to watch, but get the authorized version."
4,McLintock,"It does not get any better than John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara! When the 2 of them are on the screen together, it feels that they are truly married. Another typical Duke film with one of the BEST fight scenes in history. No one looks better taking a punch than The Duke! Of course the typical Maureen O'Hara- John Wayne ""SPAT"" is hilarious! Don't forget ALL of the same actors that you see in The Duke's movies! As I have said many times before, ""Who today could play a John Wayne part?"
2,McLintock,"Excellent movie, but the quality of the DVD is terrible-very grainy. It's like they copied a videotape."
3,"This is definitely a great movie, lousy DVD","Delta/LaserLight has also put out McLintock on DVD and it appears to use the same source GoodTimes used for their VHS and DVD, in other words, do not buy this DVD either. Too bad as this is a great movie. I will keep it until the John Wayne estate puts out an authorized DVD of it though. I have averaged it to 3 stars because of the great movie but lousy DVD."
4,A fun movie.,"Classic taming of the shrew out west. Reteams the Duke and Maureen O'Hara. They are outstanding together. (Rio Grande, The Quiet Man) Good cast plays it tongue in cheek throughout. My wife sure could pass on the spanking stuff. It does feel uncomfortable le in these times. The mud-slide scene still cracks me up."
1,The medium is the message!,"DON'T THROW OUT THE VHS!! I foolishly didn't look in this section and see the previous reviews of the DVD before I bought it. Bad move. This DVD is the worst quality DVD transfer I have seen. I compared the VHS and the DVD at the same time: The DVD was out of focus, color over-modulated and the picture slightly enlarged, so that, not only do you lose the Cinemascope aspect, but you also lose 5-10% of the vertical picture. You would get a better DVD if you copied the VHS using a DVD recorder and doing it yourself. I myself have tossed the DVD, kept the box and I'll make a copy."
1,Quality of DVD is terrible!!!! Don't waste your money.,"I am longtime fan of this movie, but how disappointing only because of the quality of the dvd! The movie itself is five stars, but this one is zero star (one star is the lowest rating for Amazon) because of the dvd quality. It was very difficult to enjoy the movie as you watched the grainy, poorly lighted scenes.Don't waste your money purchasing this Hong Kong/Taiwan version...stick to the VHS copy."
1,Very poor quality,As reported in many other reviews the quality of the DVD from Goodtimes is very poor. Many of the scenes appear washed out and the sound is so bad it detracts from the movie. It was obviously made from a well used copy of the film. There are many scratches and dust spots. On top of it all the physical condition of the disk is poor. When first played my DVD player indicated the disk was scratched or dirty. I tried cleaning it but it is still having problems. It seems a shame to waste the time and effort to produce such a poor quality product when a good copy could have been made. Hopefully a good version will be released soon.
2,Poor Quality,"I own the VHS version of this movie, and enjoy the film itself immensely. Unfortunately, the Goodtimes company has produced a very poor quality copy of the film. There are many places that have been very obviously manipulated in a modern edit bay with unrealistic zooms and grainy textures. I would buy the DVD version of this movie in a second, if I knew the quality were more akin to the original release of the film."
1,Mclintock,"Do not buy the DVD! I love this film. I grew up on John Wayme films. I don't own any of his films, and this was the first one I purchased on DVD. I can not tell you how disappointed I was in the quality of the DVD. It had lines, black dots, and terrible editing to fit it on a full screen. It was a though the worst possible copy of the movie was used to reproduce this on DVD. I would return the DVD, but I have absolutely no time. The DVD company did not do a good job. I showed this to my mom on mother's day, and I was embarrassed. She however was gracious about the flaws."
1,A sad disappointment,"Everyone who has written about the poor transfer is correct. It's a disgrace. I watched three minutes of it, just past the opening credits, and gave up. Even the opening credits were blurry, and there were so many lines and streaks as to make it unwatchable. I'll be more careful in what I buy in the future. No more GoodTimes DVDs for me.Ugh!!!!!!!"
1,Great Movie destroyed by Goodtimes,"I agree with everyone who has commented about Goodtimes DVDs. You could do better with an old 8MM camera version of the movie being aired on TBS.I have a copy made from the original movie prior to VHS release, and like the estate version, I wish someone would do a DVD letterbox that every Wayne fan could really enjoy."
1,This Must Be A Pirated Version,"Although I LOVE the movie ""McLintock!"", I HATED this particular version. It looks as if it had been produced in someone's basement by recording the movie from a television screen and putting it onto a DVD. I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought the DVD, as they all agree with me. (I will be returning it immediately!) DO NOT PURCHASE THE GOODTIMES DVD VERSION. It is AWFUL!! Look for another version at your local DVD store. The movie itself is hilarious!!"
1,Save your money!,"I can't believe Good Times Video actually released this DVD without doing any touch up whatsoever, nor even trying to get a better copy before making the DVD. Normally one of the funner John Wayne movies, a sort of western version of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" it's nearly impossible to enjoy watching any of it due to the poor quality of the DVD. From the opening credits to the closing credits, the image is full of scratches and holes. There are even several complete scenes which are out of focus and blurry. This was obviously an attempt by Good Times to make a quick buck off of John Wayne's name. Let's hope that at some point in the future someone gets the rights to this film, restores it, and cleans up the images so that the charm of this movie isn't lost to future generations. Save your money on this one and pickup ""The Quiet Man"" or ""The Horse Soldiers"". At least those DVD's are not hard on the eyes."
3,Good Times Home video release is awful,"I do so wish that Turner, or whoever owns the rights to this movie would release it on DVD from a better print of the film. I love this movie, it makes me howl with laughter. This laughter is mitigated by the horrible copy the DVD was pressed from. Sheesh. There is a much better copy available, I have seen it on VHS."
3,McLintock Review,This is a rather entertaining western based on the Taming of the Shrew. The star studded cast makes this an enjoyable movie to watch.
1,McClintock,"McClintock is one of my husband's favorite John Wayne movies so I bought it for him as a Christmas gift. Unfortunately because of our busy schedules, we have viewed it for the first time tonight (2/10/06). Although we still love this movie, the quality of this reproduction is horrible - the worse I've ever seen!! But because we are outside the 30 day return policy, we are now sadly stuck with this DVD and will go back to waiting for the rare times that it is shown on TV to watch it."
4,Mclintock,I have always loved this movie and wanted it in my collection...so far since it arrived I've watched it twice.
1,Amazon Prime Instant Streaming customers beware!,"This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies. Now that Amazon is offering 5,000 streaming titles to Amazon Prime members for free, I've been thinking about buying a wireless router and a new Blu-ray player so I can stream to my television. But I'm reconsidering based on the way Amazon has handled this title. They're making a poor-quality, blurry pan-and-scan version available for free streaming. You also have the option of watching a decent-quality print in widescreen, but you have to pay for the privilege. What a scam. If this is Amazon's strategy to entice customers into using their streaming service, then I'll stick with buying the titles I want on DVD when they go on sale."
1,McLintock!,"Seriously poor quality. I ""wish"" I had read the reviews on this product before I ordered it!! It was as if someone had videoed the movie from a TV screen. The picture color was poor, the images were ""grainy"", and the film was ""scratchy"". I loved the movie when it came out, but this was a very poor quality product. Amazon should take this off their market. It reflects poorly on them....."
1,Poor Quality,"This DVD was of VERY POOR QUALITY. The picture was blury,it had alot of static lines,vertical lines & bad sound. I sent it back for replacement & was sent another one of the same poor quality. All that was done was replacing one bad DVD WITH ANOTHER ONE. I would not recommend this version of McLintock."
1,McLintock Movie,I am very disappointed in the quality of this movie. There are annoying streaks of lines that run throughout the entire movie and the picture itself isn't clear & crisp.
5,McClintock,"Great movie! Cute story. Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne have a magnetic chemistry which makes this movie work. Chill Wills is always fabulous in his supporting role. Comedy, romance, love, stubborn pride, etc.Nice romantic comedy with a western setting."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION,The Good Times version of McLintock was of atrocious quality. It ruined the entire experience. THis version should not be sold unless there is a disclaimer of the poor quality.
5,Vintage John Wayne,"I am not a John Wayne fan. (Thank goodness my real name is not revealed here!) That said, I do like this movie. I remember seeing it as teenager or young adult, and finding the romantic interplay between Mr. Wayne and Ms. Sullivan to be delightful.It is dated, and not a movie anyone under 50 would probably like (but what do I know?) This was an excellent quality recording and a delightful way to spend a little time reminising."
5,McLintock Great!!!,The cast of McLintock was very enjoyable and being a big fan of the Duke makes it that much better.
2,"Great movie, extremely poor video quality","This is a great movie. Fun to watch. However, the DVD I received is of the worst quality I have ever seen on a DVD. It looks as if someone recorded off the TV using a camcorder. Often out of focus even at its best it is ridiculously horrible to view. Suggest getting the movie, just not this version!"
5,Its like my Grandmother's quilt - comforting.,"This book is a guide for life. I read it and will read it again and again. It reminds me of the comfort I feel when all wrapped up in my Grandmother's quilt. I recommend it for anyone who works in the world we are living in today. Practical, easy to apply tips for survival.Thanks for a guide to get through each day."
5,Perfect tool for thriving under stress,"What a great resource for today's world. We all have stress in our lives, and this book offers the tools for understanding and coping with this difficult, but essential aspect of life. If you don't know where you stand, this book is full of self-assessment quizzes and worksheets. You'll come away with a better understanding of yourself and the keys to navigating the changing world we live in."
5,Ease the stress of life and regain balance,"""Stress: Living & Working in a Changing World was a revelation - the authors were talking about me on pg. 17 - tired, fatigued, stomach problems, exhaustion - stress was taking over my life! Reading this book helped me regain some balance. Yes, life's demand will go on (a given), but once I began incorporating the 1 x 3 x 7 = 21 plan at pg. 431 into my routine, the stress eased. Now, I have energy to revisit Chapters 10 (Know Thyself) & Chapter 11 (Integrity), and examine what I really want from my life. Some goals that had been gathering dust have now been given priority, and I feel recharged! This is a book that I will use again and again when life's stress begins to get the better of me. I will highly recommend ""Stress: Living and Working in a Changing World"" to my friends & to my colleagues. In this age of cyberspace and cyberspeed, the authors have given me a life saving tool. Thanks!"
1,"Hated it, Hated it, Hated it.....","I saw Michael on a few other programs and he was hilarious, so I decided to check this DVD out. First of all, it starts out showing the most ignorant black people on the planet. Then, he goes on and on about how much money he has...after about 25 minutes I did not have one single laugh, I took out of DVD player. Thank god I rented it from Blockbuster, if it had been good I would have purchased for my collection. Maybe next time, cause this one was not funny at all."
4,"Michael Colyar Is The Most Versatile Comedian, Today!","I thought Michael Colyar's DVD displayed Michael Colyar on another level. He is truly the most versatile comedian, today! Michael's strategy is not only to make people laugh but enlightened while educating. His ability to switch emotions and jump in and out of characters is beyond being creative. He works comedy as a professionist.Jay - Las Vegas"
2,Way too ordinary for a guy like Mike,"I must be one of Michael Colyar's biggest fans. He is the ultimate comedian. This show does not do justice to his immense talent and stage presence. Trust me, this guy is 100 times funnier than this show would suggest."
4,Platnium Comedy Series: Michael Colyar,"I enjoyed the film with stand-up comedy and everyday experiences. The purchase process thru amazon was also very simple. If you enjoy comedy with flare, then I truly recomend this dvd."
1,Not good for general use,"As the previous reviewer pointed out, these will not hold well if used as a tee for three 1/4"" vinyl tubes. The middle (pointed) end will pop off and you'll end up with water everywhere but where you wanted it."
3,Unimpressed,"The pointed barb is a hair narrower than the two blunted ends. This is fine if you're going to pierce into the side of a half inch tube, as is suggested in the description, but it means that I often find the tubing on this point has pushed itself off durring watering."
2,Outdated!,"I read the book, took the practice exams in the book and spent coutless hours with the CD. I was scoring over 90%. I took the State exam. Boy, was I suprised! Waste of time--except for the math. The math part was very helpful. It gives an easy way to set up your problems--and they were right! But, they need to update the questions. I failed the test. I retook the test after checking into some of the literature that a person gets after applying to take the State exam--and I passed. Checkout Chamberlin RE School, or Allied RE School (online). You will pass...."
2,Pretty Big Waste of time and cash,"I bought this book thinking that I would be well prepared for the test. I took 4 Practice tests that they provided plus studied all the material and the glossary. Bottom line is that the practice tests I took and the material I read was so disimilar than the actual test, I thought I was in the wrong roomI passed the test, (I honestly don't know how) but don't want someone to spend as much time as I did and not pass. I would recommend a prepartory weekend class. I took one of those before an exam I took in 1995 and breezed through the test. This book is out of date and confusing.If you are looking for a quick review, this would probably be ok, but otherwise buyer beware."
2,Taking the Cal Real Estate Exam? Look elsewhere.,"If you are trying to study or cram for the California Real Estate Exam (Salesagent; not Broker's exam), DO NOT use this book as the main study material. Instead use this book only as a supplementary study guide. Look for ""Final Exams""by Thomas E. Felde. This is the best study material for helping with your R.E. exam. I used CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE SALES EXAMby Learning Express for about 1 month and for the last few weeks, I used ""FINAL EXAMS; by Felde"" and I passed. FINAL EXAMS; by Felde are past Cal R.E. exams broken up into 8 different exams. Those questions are way tougher than ""CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE SALES EXAMS"" and they are what you'll see on your Cal. R.E. exam. I swear they had 10-15 questions repeated and identical to Felde's Final Exam. None of LEARNING EXPRESS's questions were on the Cal R.E. exam I took on April 17th 2004."
2,Don't waste your dollars,"I didn't buy this book, not knowing the quality of the materials and saving ... Instead I borrowed from a public library. I spent innumerable hours studying and scoring 80% of the questions provided, including the useless CDROM. But I failed the exam. Some information is rather defunct and confusing. I personally don't recommend this title, and it needs to be taken off shelves."
4,New music styles,A refreshing new group of musicians with very interesting arrangements of classic South American rhythms. Lets hear more from this group.
5,"In my opinion, the best of Siouxsie and the Banshees","I loved this years ago on vinyl, including ""Gun,"" ""Wheels on Fire,"" ""This Town Ain't Big Enough,"" and Siouxsie's brilliant cover of ""Trust In Me,"" the python's song from Disney's ""The Jungle Book,"" of all things. But when I looked for it on CD or to download I couldn't even find it. I finally tracked down a used copy, and found I love it even better now than I did back then. If someone were only going to get one Banshees album, I'd say this is the one."
5,"Good quality, nice look","We used this knife to cut our wedding cake. It feels nice in the hand and has a good balance. I didn't want some cheap ""wedding"" thing, I looked for a good knife that would go (more or less) with the rest of our silverware, and I'm really happy we spent the money on a nice knife we'll use for years."
4,Another unique feline lovingly remembered.,"Author Sally Huxley and her husband Bob are just getting settled into their new country home when they find themselves adopted by a sickly stray cat, which the couple eventually name Pip. How they adjust to their new companion and the interesting adventures they share make for the usual heartwarming collection of Cute Cat Stories that climax with a tragic end, Pip meeting the fate of many an outdoor cat. Huxley tries a half-hearted pro-and-con argument about whether keeping a cat indoors all the time or letting it out is better or worse. I am a devout ""In"" and Pip's fate is the reason why. The book, while a little uneven in the linking of cute memories, will undoubtedly warm the hearts, before leaving the inevitable lump in the throat, of its cat loving readers."
1,Great monitor / Extremely poor customer service,"This is monitor has one of the sharpest displays I have seen on a 17"" monitor. Very sharp at 1600x1280 resolution and higher. The warranty sounds good too, free on-site replacment within 24 hours during the first year. DON'T BELIEVE IT. It has been 9 days and still waiting. Couldn't wait any longer so had to purchase a new monitor from a competitor. Last Philips product I will be purchasing."
3,fun for a kid but not durable,"I bought this player for my daughter for Christmas. When we opened it and she put a new CD in it, the CD was skipping. We determined that it was the player and returned it for another. It does seem to run down the batteries very quickly! Amazon was wonderful to deal with returns. Toys R Us was horrible, their return policy was ridiculous even though I bought it from Toys R Us through Amazon!! Store was a big disappointment but she now enjoys her CD player each night."
2,For Pamela Anderson fans only!,"Usual Pamela Anderson, includes herself and not much more. She displays everything in the here and now, she's a real material girl. If your a fan of hers then go for the book, otherwise you won't enjoy it. She communicates her problems as they exist and sometimes doesn't know when to stop. Her life with Tommy Lee and her life without Tommy Lee is explained. Theres more to her than just this book."
4,BEAUTY AT ITS FINEST!,"My only complaint, no nudity, her body is so beautiful! I really enjoyed this book! I love her skinny eyebrows and body, her beautiful eyes, her full lips(natural), I dont like her (1991-92) look. Too girl next door, we have enough of those!! Pamela Anderson is one of few women, like myself, that really enjoys being sexy, thin, beautiful!!! Why should she go back to being chubby, thick eyebrows, short hair, no makeup? I don't know about you, but I feel we need more women like Pamela Anderson! She is a sweet person, she cares about the world, she loves her children and is a good mom, she has a great personality! Well take my opinion and go pick up a copy, you'll love it and if you don't, well theres always Sandra Bullock,(boring)!"
4,NICE COLLECTION OF ODDS AND ENDS,"A collection of lesser-known and/or lost Pretenders songs. Singles like ""Brass In Pocket"", ""Never Do That"", ""Sense of Purpose"" and the title track stand side-by-side with favorite early tracks like ""The Wait"" and ""Tattooed Love Boys."" Rarities include a live version of Barrett Strong's ""Money (That's What I Want)"" (a fairly obscure non-LP B-side) and several songs from the vinyl only (and out-of-print) ""Extended Play""."
1,This songbook does what a vacuum should.,"Pathetic attempt at a songbook. Not even their best hits. Not a hint at the fact that Keith Richard almost never played in ""normal tuning"". This book won't help you get close to the sound or feel of the stones. The transcription of the lyrics is pretty good until you get to ""ad lib"" lines where Mick tended to verge on porn."
1,Very stinky,"These baskets are awful. I usually don't return anything to amazon.com, since most items are great, but these are loser baskets. First of all, they stink. They are so stinky, they give me a headache. Secondly, the wood is not smooth. Then, the paint chips. The liners don't fit. I am afraid to put my baby's blankets in these baskets because I think the wood may push through the thin, crummy liner and my baby will get splinters. YUCK. I rarely write a review, but these are seriously awful baskets. I can't believe all the positive reviews this item has received."
3,Not the best quality,"These baskets are fine for the price, but they are not the best quality. The paint flakes and the liners are made out of cheap material. The concept is good, but the quality is poor."
1,Changing Colors,"My husband and I registered for three sets of these baskets and also the hamper. The only problem is when we got them, they were all different shades of blue! If you are looking for more than one set do not buy these because they will not match!"
3,Toxic Smell,"I recently bought these baskets and the 3-pack Kids Line ones from my local Babies R Us. I opened the boxes with my son in the room and the smell was horrible. I thought I was going to get high off the smell. I immediately washed them down and sprayed them with clorox cleaner and febreeze. Neither worked. My husband suggested we ""air"" them out for 24 hours. Its now 3 days later and they still smell like paint or poly urethaine. We have decided to return them and try the canvas bags."
5,Unbeatable price,"It was nice to get both the 2G memory card as well an USB reader for this low low price. Both the card and the reader work fine. I don't have a Palm Treo 650; I use this as generic portable storage device with my PC, and it serves well."
3,Over-emphasizing laissez-faire,"Nisbet offers a quite consise and easy-to-read introduction to comtemporary conservatism. A good thing with Nisbet is that he - unlike Kirk who tend to focus on the anglosaxon world - also regards for example Hegel as a good thinker in the conservative tradition. However, a feeling is the over-emphasize on laissez-faire in conservatism. I'd recommend ""The Meaning of Conservatism"" as a more comprehensive guide to conservatism."
3,Space and place in cyberspace,"These are more a series of musings than a solid essay on the internet and architecture. It is definitely interesting, and it brings up many points that are currently being addressed or have been brought up in the years since the books publication. If it has a central theme, it is the question of how to construct space so as to accommodate the internet and technology.Mitchell is intelligent and sometimes insightful, but the book meanders and there's not much to hang on to."
1,"horrible book, juvenile and obvious","I'm going to be brief, because this is all this book deserves. If you are truly interesed in the virtual, then please don't get your hopes up. This is ""theory light"", mostly covering the obvious ramifications of technology on architecture. For a worthwhile read on this subject, go to Paul Virilio, Manuel DeLanda, or Incorporations(ZONE6)."
4,IT Revolution,"From the experience of history small, almost unnoticeable social phenomena, rather than radical movements at the foremost stage initiated most influential revolutions of our civilization. Small things like ""Pulling glass"" and ""Address"" are what William J Mitchell state as the indication of social and telecommunications evolution.This book explains thoroughly how some telecommunications systems operate. For example, Electronic Mail System, Internet, Bulletin Board Systems and so forth."
3,"Just Ok, but not bad.","This game is better than SHAUN PALMER'S PRO SNOWBOARDER. The graphics pack more detail, and the courses have a better design. However, for an MTV game, there is very little music that is actually audible. The game is ok, but is not all that it could be."
1,Worse than I expected,"I rented this to watch on a long flight, so I didn't need it to be great, just mildly entertaining. And I had heard that it wasn't very good, but I liked the idea, so I thought I would enjoy it. But it let me down, even from those low expectations. It was really dumb. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money. There is no credibility to it. It's just foolish."
1,Apollo 18,Apollo 18 I don't understand why they said this is a true account of what happen when in fact it never did!Is Hollywood trying to completely confuse are young?And as fair as the movies goes it could have been done a lot better I would give Apollo 18 *1/2.
1,Terrible movie ! Do not bother watching !,"I have to agree with most of the reviews here. I read them and thought it'd suck but I went to watch it with an open mind. I was hoping it'd be a good one. Turns out this 1 h 26 min was a complete waste of my life. Bad plot, terrible graphics, decent acting but with no story the acting doesn't matter. Actors are not to blame the writers and directors are to blame."
1,Horrible,"Gravity on the moon, not explained. Space crabs, lame. Terrible acting. There is NO action what so ever, not even an apex to the plot. Never explains how the footage made it back after they crashed. If I could I would create a class action lawsuit to get my 90min back."
3,Good movie,"I am not a big fan of the ""found footage"" kind of movie. This one was better than others I have seen. I remember the Moon landing of 1969. This is a good movie of what could have happened if a moon landing had gone horribly wrong. It is kind of Blair Witch Project meets Capricorn One. Worth a look."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"First off I have to say that the trailer is the best part of this movie.************************************Major Spoiler Alert*********************************************************************Here's why this movie was just plain bad1. The monsters were basically moon rocks - that should be enough reason to give this movie one star2. The monsters can not only live without oxygen but can go without food for a very long time - though it is questionable whether the creatures actually eat humans3. Somehow the movie footage made it back to Earth even though at the end of the movie the two spacecrafts collide into each other. How did the footage get back to Earth?4. A very bad rip off of The Blair Witch Project style horror movie sub genre.5. A horror movie is suppose to scare you. I don't find moon rocks scary in the least, do you?Bottom line, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS"
1,"a waste of time, a waste of money, not as advertised","The movie is not a 'found footage' movie, although it makes the attempt to be so. While it is interesting that we have never returned to the moon, fictional films like this actually aide the powers that be in any possible cover up of truth. Controversy sells. Dont waste your money. Rent 'The Fourth Kind' instead."
3,"""He who commands an Apollo flight will not command a second one."" - Wally Schirra",I have been alive long enough to remember the entire Apollo program. I remember watching the Apollo 17 manned lunar landing on television in 1972. So maybe that helps me appreciate this movie a little more. It brought back a lot of memories of watching the launches and dreaming of one day being an astronaut.Was this the best space movie I've seen? No - that would probably beApollo 13 (15th Anniversary Edition. Was this the best conspiracy movie I've seen? No. Was this the best monster/alien movie I've seen? No. There's too many better movies in these last two categories to even try listing them. But I thought it was worth watching - if just to watch Warren Christie (he's my idea of a primo astronaut).
4,Good build up and speechless ending,"Don't really understand why people are so disappointed? Yes the movie didn't have a huge alien that came out of nowhere jumped in the middle of the camera and said boo here I'am for the people that need to see the alien have 45 mins of screen time. But I will add if you compare it to the blair witch a lot more is shown, and explained. They make it easy to connect with the characters, and you feel something for them when one of them dies. So for that its a good movie. Maybe not as terrifing as some hoped for but it just looks great for the micro budget they shot with."
4,"Interesting premise, well done effects","The story line was good, the effects great, but the ""Monstaers"" could have been better. I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for somebody."
2,BORING!,"This movie didn't have enough scary parts in it. It's not like there weren't any scary parts in it, there just needed to be more. The beggining to this movie is VERY boring! Once they go onto space, it gets a little bit more interesting. However, it's still pretty boring. I woudn't reccomend buying this"
1,Apollo 18,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Only the truest form of idiot would believe there was one ounce of truth to this pathetic plot. The plot was miserable, the acting was anything but acting and the entire technical process of the movie was lacking. I would love to read a professional media review of this disaster to see if anything I felt about the film was viewed differently. I am a collector of film and my collection numbers in the thousands of titles and this is the only time that I could find no redeeming value in a film and decided to send it on its way to Goodwill. A total waste of money."
3,Apollo 18,This is a good film. However the copy I received was zone coded for the United States when it should have been zone coded for the United Kingdom. My DVD player would not accept it but I did manage to view it on my computer but had no sound track. This product has been returned to the senders address.
1,less than 1 star,"This is like ""The Blair Witch Project"" movie, except it looks like they had a bigger budget for special effects and better camera operators. Don't even waste your time watching this nonsense. There is nothing more I can say about this garbage.Take the money you would have spent on this movie and buy a bottle of Cisco or Mad Dog 20/20. The three hours that you will spend over the toilet throwing up will be more enjoyable than this movie. Do a net search for ""bum wines"" for more enjoyable fun than this movie."
1,straight to 9.99 bin,"The movie starts off with ""real footage"". The story is horrible it relies on cheap thrills and scary music, and quite honestly horrible acting, most of the movie is spent in the L.E.M. so all you get is a bunch of dialogue. Definitely save your money, barely worth watching all the way through. Great idea for a movie, just low budget and horribly executed."
1,Bummer,"I have seen better movies as a kid, and to see this at 73 just makes me sad. There is no attention getters or new effects that one would expect with a title like this. All I can say is it is no ""Destination Moon"" where you at least had some exciting things to it. RIP George Pal!!!"
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL MOVIE!,This movie was a complete waste of time and not at all worth watching! It has a stupid plot and a terrible ending.
1,2/3rd of the audience left the theater!,"I went to see this movie the weekend it opened. I had high hopes for it as the trailers and TV spots were pretty intense. I love a good consipiracy theory and when it comes to space, I am in for almost any good flick. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The so called ""previously classified footage"" was so horribly done and so boring I found myself looking away from the screen out of boredom. The story line was so thin the climax was laughable when you finally get what is going on up there. By the time we got to about minute 50 of the movie two-thirds of the audience had gotten up and left the theater. NASA backed out of any assistance in the making of this trainwreck and they actually need the publicity.I know it is one man's opinion and I do encourage anyone to see it just so they can weigh in on how much they too wish they had kept their money."
1,Absolutely dreadful,The film is terrible - I only watched it to the end because I could not believe anyone could get away with producing something this bad. The idea is a good one - but the movie is so poor I would say only watch if you are compiling a list of the worst movies ever made. Its worse than Event Horizon which is really saying something. Avoid at all costs.
2,Tedious,"It takes discipline to sit and watch this video in its entirety. It moved very slowly and the ""Blair Witch Style"" video quality was to say the least, annoying. The story line is a real stretch, but better special effects and better video techniques would have made it mch more enjoyable."
2,Point of tolerance,"I hate the idea of horror style.The movie started as theory of conspiracy, bet ended as horror. Disappointing.Russian spacecraft has some Russian words, but make me laugh. Totally incorrect. There was some device called ""Punkt Sderzhannosti"" - translated to English as ""Point of tolerance"" :)"
1,Worst movie in the history of filmmaking,There should be an academy award for the worst movie ever made. This movie's greatest achievement will be when it eventually biodegrades. A truly horrible waste of time. So horrible that I was going to sit down and write a detailed review as to why it's so bad... but I've wasted enough time on it already. Consider yourself warned.
1,Don't waste your time.,So stupid do not waste your time. Not real footage. Aliens on the moon looked like crabs and spiders. Horrible acting and no score so the movie is extremely dry.
4,"Thoughtful, but scary sci fi thriller","I thought this movie was a great treatment of what could have, or what might have, happened if the government found aliens on the moon in the 1970s. Three astronauts are sacrificed to see what the aliens are capable of, and how we can combat them. Would the government do that? Maybe, maybe not. But this book offers a view into what would happen, from the astronauts perspective, if the government did this. It is well done, and looks very authentic. It was well worth watching. Get it and enjoy."
3,save your mooney,it was ok. not what i was expecting. no need for HD for this short movie.save your mooney or buy candy. at least candy taste good.
3,Pretty disturbing for PG-13.,"This movie was very slow and boring in the first 30 minutes, but it was interesting. People really underestimate this movie. I don't really understand why this has a lower rating than ""The Blair Witch Project"". This had more thrill and suspense. People should really watch a whole movie before rating the movie because i see a lot of review like ""I only watched the first 30 minutes, then i stopped watching because it was so dumb."" how about watch it then rate it."
4,Apollo 18,"I did not see this movie at the theater but only on regular DVD. I regret not seeing it on the big screen. I am not sure why the harsh reviews. Ok, it may not be Aliens, but I thought for a popcorn muncher, Apollo 18 goes down fine. I enjoyed the camera work -- as a teen in that era, the footage looked real enough to me. It made the movie more believable and realistic. People complain about the lack of action. These guys are on the moon . . . in a small modular device. There was hardly room to move and was only designed to be in it for about two days. You gonna run from giant CG monsters -- where you gonna go? It either gets you quick, tears up the ship, kills everybody (only 2 people) or you just let the drama unfold. I thought the movie did it. Half-way through, I though it was spooky and developed a mood of dread. I thought the end was only OK, nothing spectacular, but, still, I thought it was enjoyable and brought the movie to a fine conclusion. I will recommend it to friends."
4,Flawed .. Yes..But Still A Good Movie,When I saw this movie I liked it a lot..Its not high art or anything. But as a good movie to for those who really don't look into any kind of deep meaning as so many other films these days try for.I liked it.Watching a movie is not a thing you get from the talk of so called film critics.Its what you get when you watch it by yourself. Like i said. Flawed .. oh yes..But to give you a joy to watch and not care what the person to your left or right care. I find it perfect. A good watch and a flight of the dark side of the galaxy
1,Killer Rocks on the moon!!!!,WHY did they waste our time?? Bad movies always crop up now and then[ie--Killer Tomatoes] but this one seems to think its a serious contender---there are so many mysterious things about the moon that could have been used[see-'Someone Else is On The Moon']---instead they go the route of 'killer rocks'--I know they were low budget but this is just ridiculous.....
1,Blair Witch Redux,"If you bought into the hype of Blair Witch Project, you will absolutely love this. Nonexistent story, constant camera moves for distraction, and some of the worst acting since Drive Angry."
1,(YAWN),"In space no one can hear you yawn. What an utterly boring, uneventful, corny movie. Blair Witch was brilliant, Cloverfield was well done, but by Paranormal Activity it was proven that the gimmick of recovered footage wasn't enough to carry a movie-it needs a good story. Believe me, this is NOT a good story. I kept waiting for the movie to begin...and then it was over. The only thing that this had going for it was that it's short."
2,Don't waste your money,Remember the Blair Witch Project...well they reminded me of it. Your really didn't much of the aliens but you kinda of know they'er out there. I bought the movie cheap (thank God) but have no interest in sharing it with family and friends.
4,Better than I expected.,"With all the negative reviews I thought Apollo 18 would be horrible. It wasn't. The pacing was crisp, so I never lost interest. The acting was quite good. While certainly no masterpiece, this was an entertaining film that is worth watching, and it is far better than the negative reviews position it to be."
4,Pretty good horror movie,I usually hate horror movies but this one is the best one I've ever seen!!!!!!! It could have been better but i really enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Being on the Moon must be really boring,When I watched this movie I thought it had great potential. The whole idea is great. The execution is terrible. It's very slow moving. There's no action and it's not scary either. One thing that bugged me is how long it took for the characters to do one simple task. I understand that people move slow in zero gravity. But the plot of this movie isn't subject to gravity. So why the heck did it move so slow too. When they finally encountered the aliens I got excited. But was soon let down. Please don't waste hard earned money or valuable time on this movie.
2,"How was the ""found"" footage found?","Although Apollo 18 is fairly okay as a science-fiction/horror film, anyone with a little common sense will not believe in its authenticity. For one, it contains the classic alien spider that is in some other science fiction movies. For another, they never tell how the so-called found footage made it from the moon back to earth. And telling of all, why would so-called authentic footage contain four different alternate endings? if something happens in real life, one can not say, ""I don't like the way this went. I think I'll make a different ending.I may have given it more than two stars if they had come up with some sort of original alien. The movie is okay if you like those type. But it's not the kind of film I would go out of my way to watch again."
2,"Interesting, but not that great","I watched Apollo 18 at the theaters about a week after it came out and I wasn't very impressed. I am a die-hard science-fiction fan and the space/alien genre is probably my favorite. The movie has an interesting premise, a secret Apollo mission is sent to the moon to investigate the possibility of a successful Russian mission only to fall prey to some hidden creature. The story, however, ends up being not really that fascinating, and the source of the horror is laughable.Despite it being mediocre, if you are a fan of space horror and don't mind the ""moving-camera"" effects, then this movie may be watchable to you."
3,It was okay,Just an average movie. I wouldn't buy it but the price was right for renting. I will watch it again when it comes out on TV.
3,Nice,Makes one think.. That we can't be the only like out there! And what do our gov. know and when did they know it?
2,Not worth the five bucks to my cable bill!!!,We ordered this on pay per view last night!! I agreed because I knew my husband really gets into space stuff and NASA. This movie was not what I thought it was going to be. The last 10 minutes was best oart and honestly those were not all that great.
2,Don't Need to Order in HD,"Interesting plot line, but the emphasis on realism resulted in an annoyingly chopping viewing experience. Since this was an attempt at actual taped footage, I suggest that viewers forgo the extra buck to order in HD. The clarity added isn't worth it."
1,One of the top 10 most boring movies ever made!,"Wow,this is so bad!I usually LOVE this kind of movies. Anything about astronauts stuck on other planets or the moon.I saw ""Moon"" and thought was OK and after watching the previews for this one, I thought they were going to come up with something more exciting. They tried, but the ""actual footage"" is actually soooo boring. The plot could've been written by a 12yo. And the ""the bad things"" are just bad special effects.I left the theater almost angry for spending my time watching this movie.Watch ""Moon"" instead for a better story development or revisit Alien to remind you of how good movies used to be!!!"
1,Below Average Film,"Terribly boring movie with bad, black and white, choppy footage. The story is a bit ridiculous, blood thirsty creatures on the moon. It seemed like another zombie movie, basically. They could easily just call this movie Quarantine 3 and get away with it.It might have been better if they didn't try to make this a ""found footage"" movie. Watching bad quality, black and white, choppy scenes wasn't pleasant and it takes down my rating quite a bit."
1,Dumb,What an awful movie. Glad I rented it and didn't buy it. That would have been far worse! I should have read the reviews before ordering it.
1,Save your money,Not worth the full price. Wait for it to (soon) show up in the $5.99 Blu-Ray bin. It is kinda of boring (and I'm a space/NASA geek).
1,I need a ZERO STAR for this movie.,"This movie is so bad I felt cheated. Apart from the lame premise of the movie, the characterization of the two astronauts is just plain insulting to those in the program."
2,Paranomal Activity versus the Moon men,"Do you find yourself watching ""The Blair Witch Project"" over and over again, saying to yourself ""man, I just can't get enough of this faux reality style of film making? But, why can't someone make a fake reality show in outer space?"". Well, your wait is over! Apollo 18 has the all the acting talent and cinematic excellence of my uncle's home vacation videos coupled with the special effects grandeur of cable access TV."
2,Sort of a hunk of junk,"I kind of felt like I was ripped off after watching this movie and I saw it for free. It was not a good film, lacked substance and originality and they didn't even sew on the NASA patch correctly on one of the space suits which was a little bit humorous. I love a good science fiction movie but the only part that was good about this one was I did not have to pay to see it in a theater and thus I gave it two stars instead of one only for that reason."
3,"Moon spiders,DOD experiment.","How many times is Hollywood going to do the alien in the stomach thing. This movie was long and drawn out. The suspense was alright, just really never delivered the big punch. The plot was laid slowly, and was well done. Gave it three stars due to just being a bit cheesy. We got this out of the BB kiosk at the local market. Glad I did not spend more then 3 bucks, it was worth that. Happy landing."
1,Spoilers,"Astronauts go to the Moon.Astronauts find Soviet landing craft.Astronauts are overcome by space alien spiders.Astronauts are not allowed back to Earth because they are contaminated.Everyone dies.In all this stupidness, just who collects all the video footage that most likely blew up with the landing craft hit the orbiting space craft?All these handheld cameras and their footage would have been blown up. For the sake of argument. Lets say the didn't blow up. Anyone sent to collect them would have been contaminated as well.Thanks for a waste of 86 minutes of my life I'll never get back."
1,let down,"I heard such great reviews on this movie from many different people. They were aparently full of it. This movie is such a let down, and i can't believe i wasted my hard earned money on it."
2,Fairly interesting at best,"The story-line had a lot of holes in it. The movie was written as if it were an expose of the DOD hiding an expedition to the moon. The suspension of disbelief is a requirement to make the movie interesting. Unfortunately, there were too many obvious flaws to make that possible for more than brief periods. The entire amount of action or drama is easily exceeded in the first five minutes of most mediocre sci-fi or action movies. Not wretched, but definitely disappointing in a Cloverfield way, only worse."
1,horrible!,Couldn't get past the first 15 minutes and just had to stop. Horrible quality. I should have read reviews prior to buying. My bad!
2,Found Footage?,"So exactly how do you find ""lost footage"" when the mission crew and the cameras never return to Earth? I'm a little lost on that point. Other than that, this is a not-so-good movie. Good closing scene though."
1,bad flick,"Every astronaut should be INSULTED by this cheap flick . DRAMATIC ACTING it is , and HORRENDOUS to behold . a PATHETIC EXCUSE to compare scifi drama and match with the finest in human spaceflight . then the language is for ""R"" rating . i didnt even finish movie . i paid full bill and STIL deleted this PUKE .if you are looking for cheap horror flick drama ; this is your thing . if you're looking for a dramatization of real or similar to real events or possibilities ; KEEP YOUR MONEY !! its not even worth the rent to even look at it . the actors actually are decent , but shot their careers with this piece of garbage .ok , more than 20 words of disdain ??? ok , i'm done . do something FAR BETTER with your money ; go buy a CANDY BAR or something ....."
5,apollo 18,good movies going into the possiblity of aliens that live on the moon.the story was well done and very enjoyable.
1,Don't waste your time,"Terrible and extremely boring. Do not waste your time watching this movie. Completely and utterly worthless. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it did not."
2,Just don't waist your time,This movie could be really interesting but it just takes too long for the plot to develop. The extras don't give you a whole lot more about the movie. They recover the tapes but I don't know how if we haven't send any more missions to the moon.
2,"possible, but not probable",apollo 18 is a hard movie to follow. it was not well made but i still found it interesting. i think they need to remake this one. i beleive in this vast universe we cannot be alone and this movie in my opinion was not worth the price.
2,Very Boring Movie,I am trying to watch this Movie from 4 days and got sleep after watching 30 min. It is a never ending Movie for me
2,Disappointing,"Yeah, I was very disappointed with this. Such a great premise ultimately wasted - in my opinion. If you're a fan of the Blair Witch type 'found/recovered' footage thing, this is for you. I was ok with it up to a point, but then it became irritating. A little of that goes a long ways but they went way past the jumpy blurry wrecked-edit threshold. On the plus side, it was a great recreation and the mood was definitely creepy. I got a sense, no matter how contrived, of what it might be like to be there under those conditions. As many other people have commented, don't bother with a Blu-ray version: it's a waste as virtually all of the footage has been so distressed, you'd only be seeing the distortion and flaws in a higher res.If you're into Lunar conspiracies, I'd instead recommend the fantastic book by Jed Mucurio, 'Ascent.' Perhaps that'll be made into a movie someday. In the right hands it'd be brilliant."
3,EHH!,"I watched this movie in theaters with alot of anticipation, but it didnt satisfy me.The concept of real life astronauts going into space and encountering some unknown horror got me really excited, but I think the problem with apollo 18 is that it simply didnt execute the idea very well. I don't really remember getting scared really and I think I only jumped once.[SPOILER] And when I finally saw whats been terrorizing the space crew, I guess my opinion of it is EHH! whatever, nothing too spectacular or new [SPOILER END].But I dont want to call A18 a waste of time, If your into sci-fi and horror then it might be worth a watch on a free night.But sadly I feel that A18 is just another greatly potential vision that doesn't succeed and will be just another movie that'll be lost with the wind soon, but hopefully in the future someone will build on this idea because of how awesome a story it can really be.Final score=2.7 out of 5"
2,The Lunar Blair Witch Project,"Just rented this PPV movie and should have read the reviews here more closely. Supposedly true? I highly doubt it and I am a big Sci-Fi fan. Lunar spiders? Give me a break! If you are an ADD/ADHD teen, then this is for you. Not for me."
2,"For a ""found footage"" horror, it was disappointing.","I'll be honest, I'm not much of a horror affictionado, though I do enjoy a good scare once in a while. I do enjoy sci-fi, for what it's worth. This movie.. while nicely filmed and acted, was just.. not.. very.. scary."
1,Horrible movie - don't waste your money,"I read the reviews before renting it - very glad I only rented it enstead of buying it - the reviews posted seemed to think it was worth watching. I couldn't DISAGREE more. One of the WORST movies I have ever seen. Terrible filmography and ridiculous story arc. Rocks coming to life in the shape of little killer crabs without some explanation of how they can exist in space? . . . Stupid, moronic filmmaking. Don't waste your time or money on this trash."
1,movie buff,"this movie realy suck!I thought it was going to get better ,it was almost as if someone video taped it on their camcorder."
5,Great Space Movie!,"I give this movie an A+++ and is a must see for any Sci-Fi or Thriller fan.Great plot, acting and creativity!"
1,What in this thing,When I saw this movie with my bros at first we said it was good but after eating at Subway we all just said this is a very bad film and the best thing I can say is that you do not have to see it at all.
1,Not worth your time,This is the worst movie ever. Not worth your time. Plot could have been told in about 10 min. Not sure what they spent all the money on. Did not look like they were in space.
2,There you go suckers...gimme your money,"I dont mind a bit of a shaky camera, but rolling , unfocus , scratched effects aregood if used once in a while, but for this movie you get it all the time...Hey ..why buy this in blue ray...when there is no reason to want to have a betterpicture ...because the picture has all these effects againts it.So after falling asleep 4 times on this, i was able to finish it.1.5 stars go to the actors, which did a good job with what they had. the restgoes to those little creatures.Its surely not a movie you will want to watch twice."
2,No cigar...,"The premise was OK, but still it was a downer. It would have been more interesting as a regular science fiction movie. Anyway, you may fall asleep watching this thing."
4,Pretty good,"The movie isn't for everybody. I can understand why it recieved a decent amount of hate in theatres but if you like found footage chillers like Paranormal Activity and Grave Encounters and you like sci fi then this is a perfect movie for you. I thought the acting was pretty good and even though this was a big budget movie, they casted nobodies/unknowns, which helps make it more believable. I guess I was hoping for more of a humanoid alien as the ""monster"" but the movie was pretty good. Not the best found footage flick but far from the worst. Quality control on these types of movies has been lost and any yahoo with a camera can make one these days but I really enjoy the ones that bring something new to the genre and Apollo 18 is the first found footage movie to take place in space."
3,Bugs in Space,"Apollo 18 is a budget version of ""Alien"" done in a ""found footage"" style.If you like sci-fi horror movies featuring creepy crawlers in space, you'll find this a tense and entertaining, if not thrilling, ninety minutes, although there is not much new here either.Other reviewers have raised the question of how this footage of the space mission could have been found if none of the three astronauts returned to earth. The answer, if I understood one of the alternate endings, is that the astronaut in the command module did manage to return, although the theatrical ending makes this anything but clear.Finally I must commend the makers of the DVD for including a full complement of bonus features, including deleted scenes, alternate endings, and director's commentary.So if you like ""Bugs in Space"" movies, you may enjoy this minor effort, which is certainly worth a rental if not perhaps a purchase."
3,A passable found footage film,"[PLEASE NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD!] There were a few things that were new here, but most of this film will seem eerily familiar to found footage film buffs out there. The multiple camera angles were a nice touch, as other viewers have pointed out. I also thought the crab creature transformation was really cool. But other than that there wasn't much new ground trod. Interesting (because it was in space), but nothing new. If you're considering watching in on Instant Video, wait until it's in the $.99-1.99 range. I don't think it's worth the $3.99 price tag."
2,Apollo 18.......There's a Reason You Should Not Waste Your Time,"Apollo 18 was in my opinion a waste of my time and money. The acting was ""B"" rated. The sopposed live action was staged and the dialog was not what our astronauts would ever use. The spider creatures were not a main part of the action as they should have been. Where did they come from and why were they attacking this mission? What was their purpose? That was never known. Why didn't the other Apollo missions see them....lmao! What a piece of dribble. Screenwriting was poor and the cinematography could heve been done by a group of imaginative 5th graders."
3,Biochemistry and Moloecular Biology,"Ill be honest, I opened it a few times, but we learned mainly from the lectures. The book was for someone who would be in depth with biochem / biochem major."
1,"Predictable, Tedius, Forgettable Characters","I don't know if I was reading the same book as the other reviewers but this book was one of the worst books I have ever read. Forgetting about the many punctuation errors, the writing is formulatic and tedious. In real life, the main character would probably be whacked and never heard from again. His sidekick, Howie, is given dialogue of a teenager and is annoying throughout. (Spoiler) Could see the fake death coming a mile away."
4,"The ""Will"" to Intrigue","My father had this book on his bookshelf, and I liked the title so I decided to read it.The story introduces us to a family man, Ben Pearce. Ben is involved in a horrible accident soon after the beginning of the book. Unfortunately for Ben the other party involved in this accident is not a honorable man.The story is about Ben's struggle to put his life back together to the state it was in prior to the accident.I could have never predicted the twists and turns that this book went through. I was very pleased that this was not another generic mystery.It is impossible to put the book down during the last 20 pages. I was reading this book on the train. Once I arrived at my train stop, I was annoyed and could not stop reading. I walked all the way to my house reading this book (dangerous, I know).this was a great novel!"
2,I regret buying this book.,"I am not an expert on pop culture, or the impact of various shows/movements/performers on pop culture, but after reading this book, I know that neither is Chris Turner. His rambling style of writing makes it a difficult read, as others here have mentioned, but I think the biggest problem is that he implies a great plan behind every joke, an agenda behind every smirk. Sometimes this is true, and sometimes a gag is just a gag. For instance, he elevates the ""Sideshow Bob rake bit"" to a level I would argue it doesn't deserve. Please, pass on this book."
3,America on Planet Simpson,"I picked up the book Planet Simpson, expecting a lot of information on the Simpsons tv show. However, after the first few chapters Chris Turner writes more on the American Society and life than the Simpsons tv show. Then at the end of his ""political lecture"" tries to draw a conclusion by using a Simpson character.This book would have been a lot better either by cutting out 100 pages. Or being more focused on the show than the politics of the Simpson Tv show writers. If you want a ""fun"" version of American society and politics seen through a cartoon it's a good read. But not a strong book on the Simpsons tv show."
3,Planet S,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
4,Better than I thought it would be,"After reading all of these negative reviews, I was fairly hesitant about wasting time on this tome; however, as an avid Simpsons fan, I felt obligated. I had to skip over most of the introduction. It seemed too personal, too contrived, and frankly, I felt as if he greatly overestimates the impact of the show at the outset. As I started reading the text proper, I was immediately intrigued. While I take a lot of Turner's social analysis with a grain of salt, I was entertained by the references, and interested in the majority of the material covered. I think I would have enjoyed a book about this subject that was a bit more academic since Turner tends to ramble and lose sight of his focus in his too-frequent tangents. I recommend this book only to hardcore Simpsons fans who are also interested in the popular culture that ran parallel to the show."
2,Did this guy have an editor?,"Wow. Another reviewer called the authors' style ""rambling"". That is an understatement to say the least. There are sentences in this book that run for over half a page. Both the author and his editors had to either be on serious drugs or way over their limit of Starbucks. Some great points, but, way too long and totally self-indulgent."
4,"A Thick, Meaty Book O' Love","I thoroughly enjoyed Turner's book. His insightful analysis of the characters' relation to U.S. Highbrow Lowbrow Nobrow Culture is dead on. Mixed in with the sharp social criticism, are amusing and insightful personal anecdotes relating to Turner's growth in the Simpson Age which allow the reader to reflect how their own lives and worldviews were and are still shaped by the show.I particularly liked the chapters relating to Lisa, Marge , Mr. Burns and The Media. Turner has a keen eye for social issues and he is not afraid to speak his mind about the fallacies of a culture shaped by unfeeling market forces. I can't recommend this book enough for Simpson fans."
2,I really wanted to like this but...,"Okay, so I LOVE the simpsons so it's obvious why I bought this book, but alas, I should have consulted the reviews on Amazon first!Whilst Turner makes a lot of interesting points in linking the rise and rise of The Simpsons to whatever is happening in the outside world at the time (Globilsation, Americans travelling abroad, immigration, Kurt Cobain etc etc) alot of time I found myself thinking 'Where is he going with this?'The first part of the book is interesting where he gives us a bit of history to The Simpsons, however the rest of the book is over analytical and self indulgent not to mention WAY TOO LONG.A determined Simpsons' fan will read it anyway, but I found myself skipping over pages, especially in the last three or four chapters when I started to tire of his claims."
3,A sociological critique of the show,"On the whole an enjoyable book, with a couple of caveats.What Turner tries to do is to show how the characters of the simpsons are representative of western [american] society in the 90s and beyond. A largely enjoyable book with a couple of very enjoyable chapters, particularly on Homer, Marge and Lisa.This is a book for fans, and fans alone. If you ain't a fan of the show,don't bother. You'll miss it.The introduction is *painful*, self referential and pseudo-intellectual. The chapter on Bart is weak but a lot of the rest of the book is clearly a labour of love and as I mentioned a book for fans.."
1,Utter drivel,"What was I thinking buying this? I'm a massive Simpsons fan - which is precisely why I DIDN'T need this book, and why you don't either. Most fans will know all the jokes, and will appreciate in their own way exactly why they are funny. If you want some geek telling you why it's funny, and which jokes and episodes he thinks are the funniest moments in the entire history of television (nothing that can't be browsed on a million fansites), then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, the other reviewer from Melbourne was right: save your money for the DVD's."
4,Good Deal!!,"Hey, i just got the I-Zone camera in the mail and what a surprise i got! The ""kit"" itself, comes with a 6 pack of Sticky Film (which is expensive i might add), and the camera. The instructions to put thee film in is at the bottom of the camera and in the booklet you recieve with the camera. Overall the picture quality is excellent for such a small camera! I use it in school, its a good way to give instant photos to your friends, and to take pictures if your leaving on a trip. I gave it 4 stars not 5 because the price for the film-its a bit expensive, but its worth it in the end! Buy It!! You'll Enjoy It~! :o)"
4,It's great except for one thing; It's not in 1979 it's 1988,"It's great except for one thing; It's not in 1979 it's 1988. Any JT fan or anybody who can use logic will tell you that in 1979 JT had a mustache, he had more hair, and the albums 'that's why I'm here' and 'Never die young' weren't out yet. On top of that in 79 he was filmed in the Blossom Music Center in Ohio, not Boston."
5,One of JT's Best,The best I have seen. JT gets the whole house involved whenever he performs. The audience is enthusiastic and JT sings all his songs just the way I like. MUST SEE!
3,Forty Something,"The best James Taylor Concert Video to date. However, it is missing some songs from the originally aired PBS showing.This one has all the real warmth of J.T.Can we get to see the unedited version on DVD 5.1 Surround ?"
1,Not at the Blossom Music Festival?,"I bought this thinking it was the concert at the Blossom Music Festival, its got the same title, why is this so? I'm very dissappointed. Thanks, a very confused James Taylor Fan."
2,Not a necessary reading,"Weak plot, weak character development. There is no psychological depth, no intelligent articulation of issues, almost no good adventure.Sometimes I got annoyed with the silly actions of the two main characters, who seem to be without an idea of what they want.Simak used an idea from his short story ""Project Mastodon"" (available, among other choices, inClifford Simak Collection of Sci Fi; Hellhounds of the Cosmos, Project Mastodon, The World That Couldn't Be, The Street That Wasn't There). But the original story, although too short, was better."
2,seeking soothing lullaby's,"This CD was disappointing. I wasn't familiar with the performers by name and thus did not expect the ""opera"" type music. With the title of the CD and the classic composers I expected a true classical flair. Boy was I suprised the minute Brahm's lullaby came resonating out with opera voice. Although the music content is beautiful, the volume of the opera voice is too extreme. This would be a fine selection for those seeking opera music. I would not recommend this for a soothing, relaxing time with your infant!"
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewer. This CD will not put my little one to sleep. The opera singing is not at all soothing. I'm sure, however, it can be appreciated for other aspects."
2,Not a Lullaby at All!,I can't give this CD anything but a 2. It was certainly NOT the Ultimate Lullaby. And although the music is beautiful I would not put my baby to sleep with this. I'm not a fan of opera and perhaps if I listen a bit more that may change. Our daughter listens to music every night. It is so hard to buy music sometimes and I went out on a limb with this one. I really wish it had stated that there were vocals - I much prefer the music without.
1,Bad Formatting,"Save yourself the time and download the Project Gutenberg file of Longfellow's complete poetry. This version is not properly formatted. The lines do not end (or, therefore begin) where they are supposed to. It is formatted like the poems are actually a prose composition."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!,I bought this Kindle book so I could search it for ideas for my personal journal writing. It's over a thousand pages long in print form but the Kindle edition isn't indexed so there's no way to search for words or phrases.
4,Favorite Poetry,"All my life I have loved poetry, especially that of Longfellow. This book contains his works, and many of his poems were taught to me as a pre-school child, and are remembered until this day. His variety is awesome, and reading his poems take me back many years! They are still as enjoyable as when I first heard them from my dad."
4,The Complete Poems of Henry Wordsworth Longfellow,I just like to have it on my I pad as I can refer to a favorite whenever I wish. I don't have to go searching on bookshelves . I loved his poems when i was in school. They never get stale.
5,very nice,I'm building a Kindle library of old favorites. A select number of books that I enjoy re-reading. Longfellow poetry is one of them. They are like an old friend.
3,Perfectly Adequate,"I love the look of this hamper, and it's a hamper... it holds dirty clothes just fine. I'm only giving three stars because I'm not over the moon for it. The paint is a flat finish, and I wish it were eggshell or semi-gloss, and having it now, I think it is way overpriced. There is nothing particularly wrong with it-- as I said above, it does it's job, but it's not as special as I had hoped. (Weird mom--- hoping for a ""special"" hamper-- I know!)"
4,Adorable,"I received this hamper today. There were no paint chips at all. It looks great in the nursery, and is larger than I expected that it would be."
2,NOT DURABLE,Didn't like the Hamper at all the wood around the handles started to break. The wood peices break and are very sharp. Children will fall into them and hurt themselves. My children have walked past it and scraped themselves good. Don't recommend around children.
3,Beautiful but not practical,"The hamper is beautiful and definitely is useful to have. My one complaint is that you have to take the top off every time you want to put something in it - it makes it tough to maneuver when you're holding a squirming baby at the same time. If I had to do it over again, I would purchase a hamper with an attached hinge or with no cover at all. Most of the time the cover sits next to the hamper on our floor, taking up valuable space in my baby's nursery."
2,Pretty but cheaply made,"I think this is a very pretty basket, but, the minute I opened it, pieces of the basket were falling off. For the money, it's not worth it, unless you don't use it and use it for show, because once pieces fall off they are very sharp."
1,dissapointment,I thought that this product was going to be perfect. It looked adorable in the picture. I purchased it and when I opened the box I was covered in little white paint chips. Basically the paint was chipping from the entire basket. I had to return it to the store and then spent a week cleaning up the paint chips that I keep finding around the nursery.
3,Cute but careful...,It's adorable & works well but pieces will break off from handle area. Could be dangerous once kids got older & started crawling...
2,Disappointed,"This little hamper is adorable, but looks are sometimes deceiving. It is not quite sturdy enough for the abuse of being used on a daily basis, or the abuse my toddler can dish out. Cute for ""looks"" but not an everyday hamper."
3,Pretentious and dull,"The Bottom Line:The beginning of the most obnoxious film movement in history (Dogme 95), The Celebration would not smell any sweeter if it was just a film: there are a lot of family-reunion-with-a-dark-secret films out there and this one is written and directly so poorly that there's no reason to make time for it if you're not a film student; watch Rachel Getting Married before you make time for this dreary and plodding piece of ""dogma.""2.5/4"
3,Could be worse,Yet another journey into the heart of the Dogme 95 darkness. Those that can tolerate vain attempts at art will mostly be enthused with this moderate contemplation on the breakdown of the family nucleus. Not for everybody.
5,The Last Great Film of the Millennium,"Perhaps, the best film to come out in any language this decade, Festen delivers on so many levels. It's a rollercoaster ride of trauma, guilt, anger, joy and laughter, all driven by a steady and assured directorial tour-de-force. Unusually high on entertainment value for a European film, Festen also bears all the hallmarks of a deep and powerfully moving foreign language classic. The universal 'family celebration theme' is a vehicle to carry some intense subthemes such as incest, abuse, alienation and guilt. However, at no stage does the viewer feel drowned by the weight of the on-screen intensity. Some perfectly timed black humour keeps the tempo at an electrifying pace, with some poignant and raw shooting techniques elevating the film to emotional heights, while still getting under the skin and remaining true-to-life."
4,The Celebration,"I had recently seen a live production titled ""Feston"", which I was engrossed in. I then searched the net for it and came up with its stage name of The Celebration. Wow, what a production, totally beleivable characters, but, what an awful family. That's how is is. I was enthralled by the performances, especially Christan. Was emotionally drained after it."
4,The Celebration,"Festen (The celebration) was the first of the Dogma films that I ever saw. It is truly a captivating experience and will leave you with a bit of an uneasiness, but it is truly worth seeing and owning. It is definatly one of the best pictures that has come out this decade. HIGHLY RECOMENDED"
5,MASTERPIECE,"Thomas Vinterberg is the most exciting young filmmaker to appear in the world scene since Scorsese's debut with ""Mean Streets."" This amazing film will hopefully reinvigorate the stale aesthetics that have dominated cinema in the last two decades and which are artistically exhausted. Can't wait for his next one."
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"This movie is really hard to describe, you just have to see it to understand. It really feels like you're watching some sort of reality tv show, but a reality movie. See, the description makes no sense ... just see it, you'll be glad you did."
5,Perfect!,"Outstanding acting, and especially editing. A very realistic depiction of the emotional psyche of a dysfunctional family."
4,Movie topic intense! Pirated Movie,"The quality of the movie I received from the company TheThree Mousekeeters was terrible and appeared to be pirated. Am not able to say I enjoyed this movie because of all the negatives such as poor qualilty, dark shadows, wiggling camera, and poor sound which all distracted from the films content. Let's hope that it was better quality than what I received thru e-bay."
5,Really good DVD!,"I like Loren Christensen's products. I have two of his books and this DVD. I have added some of his techniques into my B.E.T. ""Target Based"" Self Defense System. Coach David Alexander(.com) (World Famous Self Defense Expert)"
1,"Bad pump, very THICK chord","UPDATE: Less than one year and it died. Very disappointed.The pump is fine so far. However, the electric chord is VERY thick, for such a low power pump. It is hard to manuvear and can easily topple the pump, if not careful. Also, it does not have a ON/OFF switch in the middle as the old one had. I big downgrade from the original."
4,"Fine music, decently performed","This, the fourth release in Marco Polo's survey of the twelve symphonies of Slovak composer Alexander Moyzes (1906-1984) illustrates the transition between the earlier late-romantic composer and the darker and more modern voice of the later Moyzes.The 7th symphony is picturesque and influenced by Kodaly and Novak, a nicely atmospheric work with a very fine slow movement (which penetrates deeper than the other movements do) and a perhaps slightly let-down and messy finale. The 8th, on the other hand, was written in response to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and is turbulent, episodic and bleak.The nice illustration of Moyzes' stylistic transition makes this perhaps the most natural place to start the investigation of Moyzes' music. The 7th is possibly one of his best works. The performances are more than serviceable, the sound a little too bright and somewhat boxy."
5,Excellent,"This is an outstanding recording of these superb works. The Mozart Clarinet Quintet is simply a masterpiece. The Emerson and the clarinetist, David Shifrin, are wonderful. The Brahms quintet is performed just as well."
5,Clarinet Magic,"Actually I am not a fan of chamber music but these two clarinet quintets, especially the Brahms one, are really superb. I cant get enough of them and keep listening to them over and over to the extent that I wore out the CD and had to buy this new one."
5,the best,this cd is the bomb. i can sing to it. the playing is tight and dynamic and the cd engineering is superb.
5,Pretty Good Adhesive,"Easy to use, dries quickly but gives you enough time for your installation. Quick shipment from Amazon. Great stuff for your home use and/or any application."
2,Bikers with no idea,I have seen great Zonbi mivies just like you have. I am keeping this in my Zombi collection but the repeatablity of watching it again is real low. Buyers B-Were.
5,The bouncers in this movie...,"The bouncers in the bar scene in this movie were excellent, but the rest of the film needed help. Watch it for the bar scene!!!"
2,What did I just watch!?,"After viewing this movie, I was left wondering what I had just spent an hour and a half watching. This movie had no plot, no storyline... it was like watching people just do things that in the end had no point. The only saving grace in this movie was the hilarious scene where they kept showing this cop taking the same bite out of a donut. The ending was horrible (as in most zombie movies), but this one was especially bad. And what's with the scene where they keep showing the homeless guy? Is that supposed to be a transition between scenes or something? I'm glad I rented this and did not buy it...."
3,biker zombies or zombi,"just for the record. saw some other view say the movie was an hour and a half which is dead wrong. movie is only an hour and six minutes, very very short movie. is a real good movie for a low budget film though. the beginning really started off good and kept going for a while. the bad thing is that you don't see much of the biker zombies, just a couple of scenes then it concentrates on one zombie kid. wish the film would have been longer but otherwise not really a bad film, one that is worth checking out. hopefully they'll make a sequel thats a little bit longer as well."
4,Give this one a chance!,"Cheesy, yes! Hokey, of course! and right up the alley for those who love an entertaining little flick that's worth watching just for the fun of it. Good effects, good camera work, and yes, even good sound! I liked the music, it really went with the movie."
5,GROSSE POINTE ZOMBIES!!,LOVED THE MOVIE!! Filmed in Grosse Pointe Park on the same street that the Grosse Pointe Murder took place!!!! OMG!! Great story and a fun movie to watch! 5 STARS!!!
2,Why do I keep watching these things?,Just a realy awful movie. It's not even worth describing the thing because my brain is still numb from all of the bad acting and story(I guess). The only reason I gave it a 2 is for some gore but it's hardly worth sitting through.
1,Couldn't even watch it.,"I got this for my hubby's Biker Movie Collection, and we've seen some bad ones but this one wasn't even watchable. Don't waste your money."
4,What I was looking for.,"Little harder than I was expecting,more of a plastic feel than a soft rubber, but worked for what I needed. Great for holiday gift. Color was perfect."
1,Not what I expected.,"After purchasing this book, I found that most of the TVP products needed to be purchased from an online store rather than making it yourself. Unless you want to keep running to your local Health Food store or buying online, I would look elsewhere for TVP meat substitute cooking ideas.Personally, I would rather make my own Chiken (that's how they spell it) strips, nuggets, etc. or beef substitutes, as a right of passage rather than buying them. That's what I thought I was getting when I bought this book, but no..."
1,Not worth it.,"Judging from the titles, the book should instruct how to make your own faux chicken, beef, and pork. This is not the case. All of the recipes call for prepackaged meat substitutes. Personally, I don't want to have to rely on a grocer's, Whole Foods included, poor selection of soy products. Almost everyone out there can figure out how to make traditional recipes vegetarian using meat substitutes. If you are new to the veg lifestyle, and have never cooked a meal in your life, this book might be somewhat useful; otherwise it's not worth it."
2,Very poor quality video!,"Poor picture quality, poor sound quality and poor content makes this a DO NOT buy! Some technical tips are available but not enough to make it worh purchasing. I wasted my money on this but you do not have to!"
3,Mediocre,"The Powerpuff Girls Games aren't as good as they should be. They are pretty mediocre side scrolling games but still can be fun. The major annoyance with the game is that if you fall into a pit of water, you have to start from the beginning and recollect all the items you've found. If you're a hardcore gamer you will fly through these games. Most of the fun comes from using the passwords and unlocking new playable characters (like the Mayor!). Anyway, if you're a really big Powerpuff Girls fan you'll enjoy the games but otherwise I suggest you take a look at some of the better GBC games."
3,good way to kill time,"In this game you play as buttercup and beat up enemies. It's pretty challenging because the levels make you go all different directions;If you go down one passageway, you have to come back and go down another.This game takes forever because it has all these secret levels that are even more challenging. The great thing about this game is that you gan go anywhere you like. If you enjoy challenging games that test your patience and keep you guessing, you'll really like this game."
1,DON'T BUY,This was a waste of momey. I can't even past the first level. You have to beat each level more than once. It is so boring.
2,"Exciting, but predictable","I enjoyed Eberhardt's ""Body of a Crime"", so I was eager to read ""Against the Law"". While the plot moved along at a good pace for the most part, and the description of the Hawaiian landscape and culture was interesting, I found the characters to be rather flat and the outcome quite predictable. The author telegraphed the clues so much that, apart from a couple of minor surprises, I could figure out what was happening well in advance of the characters. Still, the book did keep me moderately entertained for a few hours."
3,I'm glad I checked it out at the library instead of buying it,"The patterns are very cute.I am currently in the process of making the rabbit, which I think is a cute knit toy. The knitting intructions are occasionally unclear and confusing. However, I'm not rigid when it comes to following patterns, and I don't mind having to be inventive where the pattern is unclear.However, I've never made a knit toy before, and I have no clue as to how to assemble the finished parts into a whole. The assembly instructions are inadequate. I'm sure that I'll manage, but I think the author should have included complete assembly instructions.I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it."
3,Quality Control,"I totally agree with the other review- I have now made 3.5 projects from the book (duck, pig, lady bug & panda) and found errors (some very minor and some rather drastic and confusing) in almost every one. Sometimes it seems you just have to use common sense over what the pattern seems to say. I have looked for corrections on the web but have been unsucessful. One would hope that if they are going to publish a book they would have someone check the patters (often times the math doesn't add up- number of stitches in the pattern row vs the number listed at the end- and sometimes it is hard to know which number to trust- espeically on the panda arms). I love the animals that I have produced, but wish it was more straight forward to do so."
2,really cute pics BUT there are MANY MISTAKES in the patterns!,"i bought this book because i thought the pictures of theanimals/dolls were adorable and was inspired me to try tomake one. i tried the zebra. there were numerous errors.i finished it but had to continually re-calculate parts ofthe pattern and re-adjust stuff. btw: i am a fairlyexperienced knitter. the instructions were also very incomplete.for example, joining the head to the body of these toysshould be explained!"
5,evil record,"not the biggest fan of black metal, but i know good metal from all genres when i hear it. this is classic stuff. the drumming is sick. the guitar playing is disgustingly fast, and the vocals i like. i would start with this cd by immortal if u are looking for their older stuff. if u like the newer thrashy stuff get sons of northern darkness or all shall fall. great stuff. buy this album. i highly reccomend it to any metal fan."
2,iPod users beware.,"Good unit with great sound. Great with radio and CDs. But the main reason I got it was to use it with my iPod. This is where this item falls flat. First off, you have to buy an adapter (KCA-420i) just to get the iPod controls to the head unit.Once you've done that, you'll find out (I did the hard way) that the data transfer b/w the iPod and deck is ungodly slow. Not music wise, but music info wise. It's extremely sluggish scrolling through songs/artists/albums. So I've basically been playing it on shuffle.But now and then, you feel like listening to a specific song/album. You can do that with this deck, but be prepared to take time to scroll to the item.I will be switching this deck for the IVA-D106 which is much faster.Cheers."
4,Alternative music,Really different music. I like this CD alot.On The Edge was listed as Harrison Ford's favorite song in a interview I read....that's really why I wanted to hear it!
2,The Shifting Realities Of Philip K Dick,"This is for those who have read all of Dick's work and want more. This is NON-Essential Dick. A much better choice to get at his philosophy s to buy (or check out of your library):Philip K. Dick: VALIS and Later Novels: A Maze of Death / VALIS / The Divine Invasion / The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (Library of America No. 193)This is one of three volumns published by the Library of America. The LOA's editions are quality hard backs and are free of the typos which creep into many cheap editions of Dick's work as originally published. The full group of hard back editions of Dick work in the LOA encludes:Four Novels of the 1960sFive Novels of the 1960s and 70sVALIS and Later NovelsWhen you are done with these and you want to see the wheels turn then read ""The Shifting Realities"" BTW. The Shifting Realities is available in book leg form as a PDF in various places on the Web."
5,Rob's Own Spin,"If you are a Sinatra fan and looking for new interpretations of his material then look no further! Rob Sudduth has done an incredible job making these tunes sound like his own...I think ""The Chairman of the Board"" would be impressed. Long live Frank Sinatra and the saxophone phenom Rob Sudduth!!!"
5,If You're Going Through Hell,I am really enjoying Rodney Atkins' CD. He can really sing! He makes you think he's been in all the songs. (He probably has) Just like he's telling his life story.
5,Great CD.,"This is actually a fairly decent cd. Of course the only hit that's on here is ""If You're Going Through Hell"" which is a good song. But you have to listen to the other songs. They're good too. Enjoy."
5,A MUST HAVE...,Rodney Atkins is a fantastic artist. The songs on this CD have so much real life to them that it is easy to relate to his music. This CD is a must have!!!
4,New Country Artist,"I liked his first 2 singles off this album, so I thought the whole album might be good. It is. He paints a picture with his words."
5,Awesome CD!!,"This CD by Rodney is an incredible one. When I got it I was worried I would only like one or two songs, but I love the whole cd! All of the songs tell a story, and some might even bring a tear to your eye. If you love real country music I really think you should pick up this cd!!"
3,One Hit Wonder,"The only hit that's on the CD is ""If You're Going Through Hell"" which I love. The other songs are ok. But no matter if you like one song or the whole CD,You will enjoy."
1,come on people!,"Goodness! What a mess! People people people this is terrible; no other way of putting it. This has a good rating purely due to the fact that people who know good music have not wasted their time listening to this trash. Listen to real music please! At least real country music like The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Old And In The Way, John Prine, etc. Come on now this is pitiful!! Pitiful!"
5,FABULOUS!!!!!,"This CD can be described as nothing more than FABULOUS!! The songs each tell a story. The houmor in ""Cleanin This Gun"" or the pride in ""These Are My People"" or the sensitivity in ""Invisibly Shaken"". This CD has every emotion. ITs real and raw and EVERY country music fan should have this CD in there collection."
5,For a Friend,"Bought it for the track about cleaning this gun. I gave it to a friend who does not like Country Music, but, since he has 2 daughters, he loves the song. One of the great songs for dads with daughters."
5,This album is one Hell of a find!,"Curb Records has scored with this artist. Not an overnight sensation it has taken Rodney 10 years so he has went through hell and back. As one of the new faces artist at Country Radio Seminar he scored big with a standing ovation for his work on this album from everyone who was inattendence. These are the movers and shackers of country music from record label executives, radio programmers, and dj's. Rodney should be looking for this album to go plantinum. Thanks for the best cd put out in country music this year."
3,"Easy to get video/audio out of sync, strange controls","The problem with this player is it is easy to get video and audio out of sync when searching within chapters. The only solution is to power down.Additionally, the controls are very nonstandard compared to other DVD players, especially for moving within and between chapters.Clearly a first-generation product from an inexperienced company - spend $20-$30 more and get the low-end player from a major manufacturer."
1,Piece of Crap,I bought this unit even though there were warnings that the remote control features were slow. They were very slow and if you push two buttons back to back the machine would crap out and you would need to turn it off and back on to get it to work again. Now the machine has died all together and it has only been three months. I am trying to get my money back now.
3,Well what can I say....,"Some huge compatibility issues with this player. If you have a sony tv stay away from it. I try to turn up the volume on it and the picture freezes but it is still playing, at that point the unit is locked up and you have to turn it off and them back on for it to work. If you can get around that issue.. the picture quality is great, yes the remote is a little slow in responce but for 200 bucks you probably didnt expect this much"
4,Few glitches...great value,"While there are a few glitches of this unit, largely related to the responsiveness of the remote control, overall it is an excellent value and great entry device into DVD."
