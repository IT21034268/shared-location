1,Don't waste $$,"I like the diet pills for energy, and this one supplied NONE nor did it kick sugar cravings. Plus you burp up Raspberry flavor all day. I'd stick to one Leptopril for energy plus it puts me in a good mood."
1,Curvelle: Not Worth It,"I actually purchased several months of this product because I saw it got rave reviews from WOMEN:S First (one of my favorite magazines). The aftertaste is just gross; I could taste this horribly bitter/citrus flavor after ingesting the pill, even hours after taking it. After 6 months of using Curvelle, I decided to quit taking this stuff. I didn't lose any weight, I didn't notice my hunger decreasing, I felt jittery, and my stomach was upset after taking it. Plus, the cost for this stuff adds up and you could probably get a decent gym membership with the monthly bill. Again, every person has a different body and reactions, but Curvelle simply didn't work for me, and I imagine it won't make some of the promises it advertised."
1,Dissappointment,I read a lot of great reviews on Curvelle and was looking forward to taking it. It has made me very weak and tired all of the time and I have haven't noticed a change in appetite at all. I am used to working out at the gym 3-4 times a week and this past week have only had the energy to workout once. I also think this pill has interacted with my birth control and after doing some research I found that high amount of green tea can interact with birth control. I don't recommend wasting your money on this product. Hope this review helps!
1,Too much green tea,"This product does make you jittery and it does have green tea, if you have any heart problems, green tea shouldn't be taken, per my Doctor it isn't good for your heart."
1,Just horrible,I bought this after reading some reviews on a website that were good. Well I was wrong. It made me so sick and sleepy. I wanted energy not to be tired. I even eat very healthy and exercise so there was no reason for the sleep-yness and sickness that this pill caused. I tried it for a week then had to stop.
2,Just not for me.,"It did nothing for me, nothing against the product for the people who do love it, but I was just not one of those people...It made me more tired and I was still hungry, and moody..."
1,Ugh!,"I'm not really into trying a bunch of different diet pills, but I thought I would check these out as my metabolism has slowed, and I need to drop about 10 pounds. I only took these for a few days because I couldn't deal with with an upset stomach and generally feeling like crap any longer than that...and I was only taking half the recommended dose. Maybe it was just me, but these didn't leave me feeling good at all. Seller did ship on time and item was packaged well, so if they work for you, this seller isn't bad."
1,A piece of garbage,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing is simplistic, contradictory, and weak. The authors attempts at describing outfits, meals, locations is silly and trite. None of the characters are likable and garnered no sympathy from me. There is no chemistry between the main character (Aja) and her boyfriend, and it is completely unbelievable that he would be interested in her. The 'engagement' scene is pathetic and stupid.This novel is a predictable eye-rolling mess. Don't waste your time!"
4,Good way to spend a weekend,"This was a very good book with interesting characters. The story took a couple of turns that I did not anticipate and that always keeps me excited. My biggest disappointment was that I was more interested in the main character's best friend (Roxie) than I was Aja. This book left a lot to be built upon, should the author decide to take us deeper into their lives in future novels. Maybe Roxie will get a bigger role next time.I also appreciated the Acknowlegments and Author's Note that was included. It started me off feeling like the author had a great sense of humor and likeable personality. After reading the book, I was glad to discover that she was an exceptional writer as well."
5,Whew!!!,"This story seems real and raw, it shows us what happens in families across the nation, this is a must read."
4,Rhymes With ...,I bought this book to help my daughter with her classwork assignment. This book has served her well and she uses it for other class assignments that I had not even thought of. In addition she likes to refer to it when she texts her friends or post on her facebook. She enjoys it so much. Well worth the purchase.
4,Just what I hoped for.,It was just what I expected. Postage was a bit more than i expected though. Packed in a large box which was not necessary.
5,THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.,"Most audiophiles are aware that Motown has mostly a mess for original tapes. There are also many monoaural tracks peddled on too many 'greatest hits' compilations. More to the point: this is the best Temptations CD I have heard -- better than Compact Command Performance.It sounds as thought some tracks are the 'electronically rechanneled for stereo listening"" versions. But, hey, ... what are you gonna do? You want Temps or not?It also seems through my old Sony V900 headphones that they went too heavy on the bass. If you have Cooledit, or something similar, you may wish to use it on these tracks.All considered, I can tell you I was in high school when Cloud Nine came out, and I am really enjoying listening to all of these cuts!This is the one to get, alright."
3,Not all I expected,"I love the Temps, one of my favorites groups. So I was really happy to see a ""Gold"" Temp cd, thinking it would have all my faves on it. It does, but really does not need the second cd. I really only play the first cd as the second has only non-memorable Temps. Also, I wish they played the full album length versions. Cloud 9 and Runaway Child are much longer in the album versions and are two of my favorites. I like the David Ruffin years but I prefer the Dennis Edwards years."
5,Temptations GOLD,If you are a fan of The Temptations and old school music this ones for you. Every hit from the past to the new is here. A great buy for the money.
5,Yesterday's Tomorrows- a review,"I have had a long-term interest in the past's view of the future, and very much looked forward to receiving and reading this book. I was not disappointed, by either the informative text or the excellent illustrations. Mr. Corn is to be congratulated on producing a high-quality,engaging and readable book on a subject fascinating to many of us, either for fun or serious study."
3,Fun but not enough,"I agree with the reviewer below. It's one of the few books on this subject (I've only seen one other) so we have to live with it. On the other hand it's small, it's a bit scattered in its approach, and it feels like a museum gift-shop item/show catalogue of sorts. I would like to see someday a huge, profusely illustrated, and text-rich book on the complete history of portraying the future (positively) which is an historically recent phenomenon. It died probably around the time of the '64 World's Fair and depictions of the future since then have been largely dystopian. Nowadays they're downright awful. This is something we need to address because unless you can conjure up imagery of an upbeat future you're not likely to even try to create one. This book made me miss the days when people thought more positively and hopefully about many things, regardless of how bad it was at the time. Imagine the images in the mind of the average contemporary young person of the ""World of 2050."""
3,"Good, not great","This is a smallish book with some illustrations but not enough for my purposes. That said, the book isreally quite interesting and it pulls you in. There are also some neat reprints of old magazine ads andrelated material. Overall (I was looking for a kitsch picture book) it left me a few color plates short."
3,Good ideas...,"I'm a scrapbooker and I'm always looks for new ways to say what I need to on my pages. That includes sticker lettering and alphabets and such. But alphabets that *I* can do are especially helpful. That way I can make the lettering whatever size I need. These are some cute lettering ideas that would be good to add to any scrapbooker's ""tool kit"". It's worth a look, and has a place in my craft reference library. :)"
5,Millkshake Maker Rocks,"Finally received the Milkshake Maker as a gift after wanting to get it for years. This works like a charm, just like the the old ice cream shop makers of the past. The maker is beautifully chromed and very heavy--it's not going to get accidentally knocked over or slide across your counter, and the double disks on the shaft make a thick, airy shake (or ""frappe"" for some New Englanders, ""cabinet"" for some others) that is absolutely perfect. The metal mixing container is solid and large enough that when the maximum recommended amount of liquid is added you can have two large glasses of sweet, silky beverage. Forget the small, plastic makers. This is the real thing!"
4,Milk Shake Mixer,"I purchased this item as a wedding gift for our daughter and new husband. They have an extended family of four children ranging in age from 7 to 16. They loved the gift. When it came they immeadiately made milk shakes and said it performed very well. They were pleased with the look, the operation and said it made very smooth shakes in a very breif time. It did not have the tendency to clog up as blenders do when they try to make a milk shake. So far, it is everything I had hoped for."
5,Wonderful mixer,"I have used this mixer for three years to whip cream and to make medium thick milk shakes. It is very good. I got one cup with it and purchased two more that are too short to lock on for mixing, and must be held by me. I do turn the cups, even the one that fits the mixer, by just turning the cup as the mixer is running. For whipped cream I take the cup off once and stir with a spoon, but for shakes it does an excellent job. The cup that came with it is a 28-ounce size."
2,"Ok, but...","The performance of this item was a little disappointing. Making milkshakes isn't as quick and effortless as I would have hoped. We routinely have to stir up the contents of the cup to get all the chunks of ice cream broken up. And they usually just stick to the shaft of the mixer. If given the choice again, would not purchase this item."
2,milkshake maker,"I like having the milkshake maker. It came in the mail fine and all, but the safety on it really makes it difficult to get the mixer to the top of the glass to mix it well without making the drink too runny. I work around the safety , but this guarantees a bit of a mess."
5,Love it!,"I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer. I purchased the Oster milkshake maker and use it almost everyday. Three of my sons love their shakes super thick...the Oster had no problem with the amount of ice cream. My other son watches his weight for wrestling, and I just put low-fat milk and a little cocoa and the Oster whips up an incredibly thick drink (usually making a glass and a half). If you put in some crushed ice with milk, it also whips up very thick and frothy. I am very pleased."
2,wouldn't recommend,"I just purchased this milkshake blender. After making two milk shakes, I'm returning it. I like very thick milkshakes, and this blender isn't quite up to that. The motor isn't that powerful, and the blending disks are pretty much smooth, unlike the ""rippled"" disks you see on milkshake blenders at diners. If you're not blending milkshakes, or you don't like them thick, you might be happy."
3,Ergonomics be damned...,"Bought this for my daughter who is a milkshake fiend. I like thick milkshakes and this seemed to be the best one I could find.All in all I guess it's okay but there are a few issues I have with it.1. The ""safety"" swith is idiotic. In order to keep the thing running you have to have the cup hooked under the safety tab so don't think about moving the cup up and down to mix the shake. I fixed it by duct taping the switch open but the ""tab still causes the cup to hang up when your moving it up and down. A little more ""re-engineering"" is needed.2. The blades are flat so there is no distortion to the ice cream/milk combo so the mix just spins around. Looks like I'll have to buy the optional blades to see if that'll help.I prefer to use my high powered blender, but you can't convince a 14 year old girl whats right...."
1,Not a thick shake maker,"If you like thin ""foamed up"" shakes this unit may be for you, but if you want thick commercial style look elsewhere. It has two adjitators but they are flat and useless. My single plastic agitator Hamilton beach works better. Very disapointing."
4,review of oster malt maker,great for what my son-in-law needs for his protein shakes and malts.now my husband wants one.
1,Doesn't ship well!!!,"I ordered this milkshake maker for Father's Day and it showed up broken. I notified the shipper and was told another would be sent. Again, the second showed up broken. I was promised another would be sent and have yet to see it!"
5,Milk Shakes for Family Fun!,"I bought this for my husband even though I am the head MilkShake maker. He likes to have a milkshake every sunday night as our family thing to do. This makes a very smooth and creamy shake and we are enjoying it. It's easy to clean up, it's easy to start and stop, and it makes the perfect amount for each person. We are enjoying the fun and the look of it as well. Like an ice cream shop!"
4,happy with purchase,The mixer is made of metal chrome and is heavy duty. Does a nice job of mixing but will NOT crush ice. Only downside.
3,Not so happy,I am not so happy about this item. I broke up a banana to make a milkshake and there were chunks of banana's still left after much proding.
2,Poor Design,"Got this item for a birthday as replacement for 10+ year old Danvier mixer. Oster has over-complicated a basic kitchen applicance with too many 'features'. The chrome container must be placed exactly, otherwise a safety switch prevents the unit from operating. Forget about this one if you like to move the container while operating for better froth or mixing. It's also difficult to discern the rotating selector switch position on the top of the unit unless you have bright lites. The mixing rod is permanently attached, so one must clean it with a dish sponge (a pain) or add water to the container and turn it on to rinse (a real pain)."
3,Only for Milk and Ice Cream,"This is a good milkshake maker. I tried to put other items in my milkshake but the blender ""arm"" did not do anything with those items except push them to the bottom of the container. I would only recommend it if you are looking for an old school style milkshake maker. It has a hard time blending up the milk and the ice cream together."
2,Nice looking but underpowered,"I bought this mixer exclusively to make milkshakes. With medium hard icecream it boughs down severely and takes a couple of minutes to completelymix the ingredients... milk, chocolate fudge, malt. As ""Scotty"" would say""aye need mooore power"", so I bought a commercial Hamilton Beach mixer with 3/4 hp..."
1,MISLEADING,"This book needs a warning on the cover of the book because of the graphic violence it depicts. It is misleading from the cover and title that it is only about this fireboat. It entails much more. Adults need to read this prior to reading it to children, then decide if they want to share it with their kids. If they do, they need to have some pre-discussion with the children about the topic of 9/11. Too many pages and too much graphic violence was shown for a book for the younger age group. It could have been handled in a much softer approach. As a parent and an educator I was shocked by this book. The pictures and wording were wonderful, other than that section. It needs to be revisited before another printing is made."
2,needs editing,"I bought this book for my 4-year-old son who loves anything to do with fire trucks. The title of this book is a little misleading - the story is more about 9/11 than about fireboats (my bad for not reading the description in detail!). I agree with the other reviewers that a warning or note should be put on the cover that this is about 9/11.While it is a nice story, I found that some of the sentences and transitions were choppy and forced - making it difficult to read at times.Also, for a children's book, I thought the 9/11 detail was a little too graphic. I found it odd that the story started out all happy and rhyme-y about how NYC was growing and developing, and then I turn the page and there were graphic illustrations of planes crashing into the twin towers and mass chaos. Literally took my breath away and made me cry (freaked my kid out because I was crying - thanks for that!)."
5,This will bring a tear to your eye,A delightful book about a 9/11 unsung hero. If you lived through 9/11 it will bring a tear or two to your eyes.
3,Not a bad stepper,The only thing I don't like with this machine is the the maximun height it can be adjusted to. It is just too low even when adjusted to the maximun height. So you spend more time worrying about trying not to hit the bottom instead of having a good workout
3,Corey Everson Stepper,"Wish this had handlebars. This takes some getting use to!It's difficult to balance on this. I must use a high-backed chair or lean on a wall. Also, because it works by stepping sideways, not the usual up and down motion of most steppers, I sometimes have pain in my legs or hips. I can just about tolerate 5-10 minutes on this."
5,Fabu!!,Bought this online and love it!!! 2min workout 3 times a day!! The perfect answer for Texas humidity and heat - no excuses now!!!
4,Steppenwolf - 'Gold' (Geffen),"A 2-CD,31 track compilation release of Steppenwolf's work.Don't believe I've ever seen this one in the stores.Ideal if you've had to(in the past)get rid of all your Steppenwolf to pay the bills,move,etc.You know how it is.All the better known material is here,like ""Sookie Sookie"",""Magic Carpet Ride"",""Hey Lawdy Mama"",""Monster"" and ""Rock Me"".Not to mention some of the 'deep album cuts' that I,personally don't remember such as ""Your Wall's Too High"",""Take What You Need"",""Screaming Night Hog"" and ""Drift Away"".Good music to play in your car CD player,while traveling a bit.Simply good all American late '60's album rock.A should-have."
1,horrible case design,this case that the 2 cd's are in will keep falling apart. i never seen one designed like this
1,...,"Cute little puffin, and served his purpose as a prop for a costume. Now he resides with the rest of my stuffies on my desk."
4,Great piece of software for the price,"Kids get a hours of fun, simple but educational games. The 3 for the price is a strong buy, I strongly advice to get this."
2,Too Much Snark and RVing,"The author of this book inadvertently writes his own review. Two thirds of the way into the book he writes about the boredom that sets in among all the people involved in NASCAR racing half way through a 40 race season. Unfortunately, reading about a boring season is as bad as participating in it.This could have been a great book. The author covered an entire NASCAR season traveling to almost every race in a luxury motor home. The title suggests that the book is about the focus that every team has on doing well in every race so they can earn big purses, ""Sunday Money"", and get all the benefits that flow from that success. Instead he wastes too much of the book writing about motor homes and making condescending observations about local residents and colorful fans."
2,The agony of watching your neighbors vacation slides.,"This is in reference to the 2005 hard cover addition. There are a number of good anecdotes regarding NASCAR, some drivers, the fans and races; however, the majority of it was like being invite to your neighbor's to watch a slide show of their vacation, and every slide had an agonizing story that only they could appreciate. I was also turned off by the fact that the author felt the need to include profanity. The profanity was limited and usually in the context of a quote, but nothing would have been lost if he had used ""bleep"" or even f..., m..... f....., etc."
2,Wonderful adventure ruined by poor writing and lack of depth,"I am in shock that so many rated this book so highly. I'm well educated, love competitive sports and like to work on cars so my affinity for NASCAR is natural. But I have no idea who this guy is writing to. The history was OK, and I thought the epilogue about the future of NASCAR was the best part of the book, but taking 4 pages to describe a ""pit lizard"" and 4 more pages to describe a pretty woman as she waits for her boyfriend, with the big payoff being the fact that she has a tattoo, and if you're getting sick of this long run-on sentence maybe you can get a job a Sports Illustrated like this guy did because he is quite fond of them."
1,Reads like a boring blog,"After attending my first NASCAR race (Talladega), I wanted to learn more about the entire NASCAR experience -- the race and RV'ing extravaganza. However, this book drags on forever.If you've never been to a NASCAR race, go. If you've been to one, you certainly do not need to read this book."
2,waste of an afternoon,"If the florid, stream-of-consciousness prose doesn't irk you, the author's habit of inserting his studly self and his 'Beep' into every few paragraphs will. I wound up skipping around a lot to get past stuff like 3 pages on buying a RV.If you know anything about NASCAR, you'll know he didn't do his research. How can the guy talk about racing legacies and the tragedies that hit these legacy families--like the Pettys and the Earnhardts--without mentioning the Allisons? How can he mention Mark Martin repeatedly, yet not even interview him? The guy is a prime example of a driver who's successfully straddled old NASCAR and new NASCAR. I hate to think that this might be the introduction to someone who's not familiar with the sport.The really frustrating thing is that the book has potential. He brings up some good points--if he ever got around to them.Don't waste an afternoon of your life on this."
1,Overrated,"If you know anything about NASCAR this book has nothing new to offer you. The prose style is gushy, Esquire type ravings, and many of the chapters have appeared as articles in other magazines, including Sports Illustrated. If you don't know anything about NASCAR, or prefer intelligent, well-written prose, Jim Wright's Fixin' to Git or Shaun Assael's Wide Open are much better introductions to the people and the culture around NASCAR than this book. Spend your money on something better, like a Raceceiver!"
5,Great Race stories you can share,"This is one of the funniest stories I have ever read about NASCAR fans. If you enjoy racing as I have the last 40 years..this book will be one of your top books to read and share with your racing buddies.The next best thing would have been with those folks on their great American NASCAR adventure.I must say though, when you are reading through the chapter's you will feel like been there done that..and by golly, I brought home one of those tee shirts, plus make sure I it was washed for the next Sunday's race.Gentlemen...START YOUR ENGINE'S"
5,WHAT A TRIP,"Jeff MacGregor and his wife, photographer, Olya Evanitsky embarked on an adventure that most of us will never take especially in a motor home. Thanks to the brilliantly written stories about the sport, the fans, the drivers I learned, and enjoyed, more than I ever expected. Who knew a 50 year old Mom could love a book about racing. It was fast, fast, fast and I felt every turn with every page. The author's humor was wonderful. As my eyes raced to the finish line, I was sad it was over and longing for more. Treat yourself to Sunday Money."
4,Love this series,"I found this series late, but I enjoy it a great deal. The characters are fun (and sometimes silly) and also deal with issues that we all face--how to integrate other cultures into our own knowledge base."
5,real nice book,hardcover book was in excellent shape.i read it and then passed it on to my local library..they were pleased to get it .worked out great for me and them.
1,Not even bad enough to be funny,"Rebsamen fails J.R.R. Tolkien's basic test of ""offering an harmonious choice of modern English words"" (""On Translating Beowulf). It is not as dreadful as some other translations of Beowulf, still it is still a dismal read. When reading Rebsamen, I was struck many times by the lack of correspondence to the original poem. This ranges from strange language choice (Rebsamen made up the word ""deemer,"" for the Old English word for judge) to complete deviance from content of the poem. On the first page of the translation, Rebsamen has Scyld ""floating with gifts/a strange king-child."" Bad poetry, worse translation. The line Rebsamen is translating means, ""found destitute, he experienced consolation for that."" Tolkien used J.J. Earle's 19th century translation as an example of a failed translation of Beowulf. I've read Earle; his translation is bad enough to be funny. Rebsamen doesn't even attain that."
1,FORMAT WARNING: BEWARE,"I bought this unit so that I could create a larger 80GB SQL Server database on it and offload it from my laptop hard drive. Of course, there were no instructions with the drive. So I brought up SQL Server and tried to create the database. SQL Serv, not one for informative messages to begin with, gave me some generic error message. It took a while for me to realize that the drive was formatted as FAT32. FAT32?!? Literature says that it's compatible with XP. FAT32 on XP?!? SO I formatted the thing as NTFS. SQL Server tried but couldn't quite bring itself to recognize the drive. Needless to say, I dumped the drive and got another."
4,Average Unit,After I received it noted that was a bit clunky. I'm happy with this drive. It was easy to set up. Although there seemed to be some problems initially they seemed to have gone away. Be aware that the unit does heat up so you can not leave it on all the time. Not that you would want to if you are using it as a backup drive that should be used during emergencies. Key for the purchase is cost. The low cost outweigh the potential issues related to the unit.
5,Great!,"This is great. I always needed a hardrive, but never really had the funds for one with alot of space, but this was affordable, and it works great."
1,Wish I could tell everyone not to buy,"I bought this product a year ago and it has now failed (technical term from Seagate). They could have replaced the device if it were still under warranty, that's easy enough, but I won't get any data off of it, and that's all I truly care about. However, they have graciously offered me the data recovery service for $1,400. For a company and a product that I put my trust in, that I put my money in, I would expect a little more ownership on their part for what I have lost. Only buy this product if you have others to do simultaneous backups on...you can't trust it."
2,Didn't work for me,"I think it helps one to get to sleep, but that wasn't my problem, mine was staying asleep for more than 2-4 hours. Even taking 2 more tablets upon waking was not effective for me. I think the Boiron for stress helps equally for initiating sleep. I've tried melatonin, valarian root, benedryl, sleepy time tea, etc. and all aid in getting one to sleep but not maintaining sleep.Any suggestions??"
2,not the solution I'd hoped for,"I was disapointed to find that the reaction to this organic substance did not meet my needs.I have an ant problem in my house near where I keep my parrots.The population seemed to be less but the substance did not erraticate the ants.I am also concerned about pets that could injest poisons.Ironically a covering of table salt in the doorway and along the wall seems to confront the ants digestive symptoms and keep the pests more at bay.I used to use the typical ant traps with the poison that is spread to colony,but I am against chemicals that threaten my household pets."
1,Does not work at all,"This powder does not work at all. I followed the instructions meticulously and it seems that ants and spiders are laughing at my face!I assumed it would take a couple of days for the product to work so I waited. The ant ""traffic"" around my window did not diminish, no change whatsoever.I also tried this powder in a corner where we usually have spiders and they are happy as ever. So I had to go back to Raid spray (that does not fail)."
5,"Great, worked like a charm...I think","I recently moved into a new place that apparently as bug issues (oh joy!). I wasn't sure how to get rid of silverfish. I know they like boxes and having just moved but with no time to unpack, I didn't want the issue to get out of control. So, I purchased this product and sprinkled it in the three places in my apartment where I had seen silverfish emerge on a few occasions. A few days later I stopped seeing them. That was almost two months ago now, so either this product did the trick or the critters are gone. I assume it is the product though because I still haven't unpacked!"
3,Good,This powder seems to be doing the job but is messy messy!!!!! It comes out in a poof and you need to wear a mask.
4,It worked (eventually) despite application problems,"This bug killer comes in a powder form. The bottle is supposed to be a squeeze bottle where the powder comes out gently when squeezed. Not much but a poof of bug killing powder came out when I squeezed the bottle and I was not too keen on breathing a fine cloud of bug-killing powder while I was applying it. So, I took off the top and applied it by tapping out some along the doorway where the ants choose to invade every summer.The ants were already in the midst of a full invasion and had survived applications of other pesticides in the form of outdoor bait traps. I re-applied this product multiple times over the course of a month and eventually the ant invasion stopped.The bad news - it took a while to work.The good news - the traditional fall encore of the springtime ant invasion did not happen so it seems to have had a lasting impact."
3,Its ok,"Didn't work as well as I would have liked, still have the problem, but would rec-commend cause it did help, and would probably help with the other crawlinginsects"
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought this product ,because it claimed to kill earwigs. Well, it doesn't kill earwigs; perhaps nothing short of chlorine bleach or acid kills earwigs."
3,Poor delivery system.,"I'm willing to accept that this product takes some time to work, and I really don't think it presents a safety hazard like some others said. The applicator is hardly a precision device, however. It delivers the powder in bursts, alternately creating quite large lumps along with a cloud of fine dust, then next to nothing. I used it outside; I would never consider using it inside the house. Too messy."
1,Didn't do much,"I live in AZ and have had a problem with crickets getting in the house and roaches invading my backyard. Someone recommended diatomaceous earth, so I decided to give this a try. I didn't seem to do anything at all. I applied it around my doors and windows for a couple of weeks and saw no reduction in either crickets or roaches. On the other hand, using boric acid with roach lure worked like a charm.I don't know if diatomaceous earth is the problem or if it is this particular brand. In either case, this did not work for me at all."
3,Not so much product for size of bottle,The bottle is very large but when you get it and read the label it only has 7oz of product about 1/4 of the bottle is actual product. Don't know if it is working yet or not but this product is suppose to be the best for ants so I am sure it will work.
3,A pretty safe product,"I like the idea of this product -- a safe way to kill crawling insects without using a strong pesticide. The spout is also extremely convenient, especially when trying to get it into large cracks and crevices. I'm a little apprehensive that the product only contains 79% of diatomaceous earth and that it does not say on the packaging that it is ""food grade"". I have used this in the cracks and other areas outside, but I think I will continue to use food grade diatomaceous earth when using it inside because that's what I prefer to use around my dog. It IS much easier distributing it with this packaging rather than using a spoon or scoop with the typical DE containers or bags."
3,"Not terrific, will use my other products instead","I typically useOrtho 0196010 Home Defense MAX Perimeter Granules - 2.5 lb.to work around the perimeter of my house. The granules are easy to apply and use and they really seem to work.I decided to try Safer Brand Powder Bug killer and applied it as directed. This is a powder and it is best applied to ant hills and as directed provided there is not the lightest bit of breeze. It will blow around like talc and that isn't fun since despite it being called ""Safer"" it is hazardous too.This did not work for us. I find the perimeter granules more effective."
4,Diatomaceous Earth Powder,At first didn't think it was doing anything but over time no more bed bugs..so they are hoping it is doing it's job! This is for friends of ours and this is their rating.
3,Did not work well,I saw a huge colony of ants on my sidewalk and used this DE to try and get rid of them. The ants crawled through the powder and nothing happened. The powder is supposed to damage their bodies and kill the insect. I gave it a few days and nothing happened. I made sure the powder stayed dry. We still have ants galore outside trying to get in. I will try it again.
3,Good alternative to,I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine ProgramThis powder is a good alternative to dangerous chemicals.Although you have to work more to ensure it does its job.In other words you must check and the next few days and reapply.Even though this is safer one must be careful not breath the powderand is best to use a facial mask.Overall good product.
4,My incredible ant invasion,I have ants EVERYWHERE it seems..this year they started in February when it was still cold. I live way out in the country in the middle of the Hoosier Forest but no anteaters in sight to help with the overabundance of ants. Anyway this stuff does work..I don't like the application bottle very well. You aim and squeeze and it blows the stuff out. I needed to place it on a vertical strip of window casing so I have been squirting it out and then using a paint brush to dab it on areas where I need it to go. Seems to be working. It's messy..I don't like it but I don't like the ants either. The ants avoid it entirely even though someone said it had bait in it. I put this near my cat's food bowl and the ants are finally leaving that alone. So for that I am grateful and would buy this again.
3,Effective but expensive compared to other brands,"Food-grade diatomaceous earth works to kill bugs without potentially dangerous chemical exposure. You do want to avoid breathing it in or getting it in your eyes. It can be messy. But it's a very useful, effective product. This Safer brand I tried cleared up a small ant infestation in two days. Is this product, which is said to include bait, any better than plain food-grade diatomaceous earth? Not that I noticed. You can get the plain stuff on Amazon in bulk and if you are going to use it repeatedly that is much less expensive. The applicator here is awkward to use--doesn't let much powder out. I just removed it.All in all this certainly works but I wouldn't consider it a good value. You are paying quite a bit for a small quantity of diatomaceous earth"
3,The Mystery Powder,"The problem with rating a product such as this insecticide is that I cannot be sure of its effectiveness. Most reviewers here appear to purchase this product to destroy ant infestations and bed bugs. My problem is with centipedes. Summertime may be easy living, but my nights have less lonely with these creepy crawlers coming out of the floorboards and radiators. I do not wish to coexist with centipedes and so I bought this product and smothered the perimeter of my room with it. Of course it's messy, but I am in favor of messy powder over centipedes. It has been about a month and the centipede count per day has varied so much that one could not write out a formula. I wonder if it correlates more with the temperature outside than with the powder. One night I will have 4 nightly visitors and another night I'll get 16. Or none at all. In the past week I have had less, but has this anything to do with the powder? Unfortunately I don't have enough evidence to judge its effectivity."
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY,"Well, i have bed bugs and I have look everywhere, and I really mean everywhere. Still, I am not able to know where they are hiding. I have encasement in my mattress and pillows and I don't have a box spring. So, i truly know they don't come from my mattress. I bought this powder and i dusted everything with it. My bed, under my bed, in all the corners and cracks. I have a platform bed, so all the rails and supports are dusted with it. Its been more than 2 weeks and i am still seeing bed bugs. The tiniest ones. I have seen and kill like 4 or 5 already. They manage to walk through this powder and crawl to my bed and there is no way that they would no pass through the powder. So, this is not working at all! I'm not sure if pure Diatomaceous powder works better, but this crap does not. The thing i hate the most is the huge mess it leaves behind! OMG i am still trying to clean it!"
2,When Does It Work?,"I had ants in my kitchen, mostly around the sink. Wanting to be careful I tried this. My ants are southern and might be a little different but they loved the stuff like sweet tea and kept coming back for more. I admit I like immediate satisfaction, so needless to say I didn't get it."
1,Bad for your lungs and doesn't work on ants,"I've had this out for days and ants just walk right through it without issue. In fact, they are still increasing in number.Trading pesticides for something that can damage your lungs also doesn't seem like a nice trade-off. Please don't use this product around animals, especially the small ones with weak respiratory systems! I can't imagine the harm this would do to rodents and birds.I wish I would have just stuck with poison ant baits than bother with this junk! So much for trying to have a pesticide-free home. What a shame!"
3,"Didn't work entirely, but did work a bit. Wouldn't use alone","This product is great but it didn't work alone on the problems we were having with various creatures. We moved into a new house and had a few unwelcome guests. I put some of this stuff down and it did kill some of the bugs, but not all of them. Also, it's kind of messy looking to have this stuff all over the place in the quantities needed to work properly. I'd say to go ahead and use it, sweep it into cracks and things because it can't hurt to have some extra, BUT, if you have a big infestation of anything I'd go with a professional in the end, which is what we ended up doing."
3,What's in this?,"I have used diatomaceous earth as a bug repellent in the garden, and it works as long as it's dry. I am happy with the fact that this contains diatomaceous earth. But then it says it is 22% ""other ingredients"" and doesn't say what those ingredients are! It does say, ""Avoid contact with eyes. Avoid breathing dust. Use suitable dust mask. Use adequate ventilation."" So I don't feel comfortable sprinkling this 22% unknown product around my house with my kids cruising around and my dog snuffing in the corners. What is this stuff?"
2,good idea,the bottle got to me crushed and it was hard to get out of the bottle. i know it was cheap but noone likes damaged products
1,MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN,"We have a very mild bed bug issue. I generously applied this baby-powder like substance to the entire room. It looked like a winter wonderland in there. When you try to vacuum it up it blows around everywhere and apparently its dangerous to breathe in according to the warnings. After treating my house with this stuff (as well as other methods) for 5 days, the bugs are still here. The exterminator came and said we have an extremely mild case of bed bugs, localized to one room (so far), that probably came from a guest, or a kid at school etc. Even with such a mild case, this stuff did NOTHING. I will say that the one bed bug the exterminator was able to find was dead, so maybe it got one but it doesnt get em all. Or even enough of them to make a difference. Save your money, call the exterminator.... Your gonna end up doing it anyway."
2,Great idea but a mess,"When I saw a couple of bugs in our apartment, I wanted some way to kill them without killing myself in the process. I thought this would be great since it is not at all harmful to humans. Except...it is really annoying to have powder all over the floor. It just looks weird and messy. No one can come over because they'd think you sneezed into a bag of flour or something. I'm all for body-friendly, earth-friendly products, but this one just isn't really practical."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"THIS PRODUCT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. ONLY WORKS FOR GET MY HOUSE DIRTY, AND I GET SICK BECAUSE I HAVE ASTHMA."
2,doesn't do much,"This product is very messy as it is basically a white powder that sits on the surfaces of your home, window sills, floors etc, where you put it. I am not sure that it works as I have not seen a change in the number/damage of bugs in my house. I got it for carpenter ants mainly but have not seen one insect killed from walking through this white dust. In fact I have seen quite a few spiders and other bugs near it walking freely. If a product is supposed to sit on surfaces indefinately to have a long term effect, they should dissolve or disappear after a while instead of me now having to go and vaccum it all up unsure as to whether or not it worked."
5,works fast,I bought this to stop ants from eating my strawberries. It worked fast at getting rid of the ants. Now If I could just get the birds to stop eating my strawberries.
1,Does not work at all,I had a problem with bird mites at the house and ordered this stuff thinking it will solve my problem. I sprinkled and sprayed it everywhere yet the mites are still there! So I figure maybe this stuff does not work for bird mites and tested it on other insects: ants. I powered on and dusted directly at an ant trail only to watch those ants prance around for hours. A few days later and the ants are still there. What is this diatomaceous earth good for? Probably just for paper weight but not insecticide. I would never buy this waste of money of a product again.
4,big bottle only half filled,"Product does the job but when it arrived it was only half filled, sort of like a bag of chips you get at the super market."
3,hard to use,"I dont know how it will work on killing bugs but I can say its not at all easy to apply. I mostly got clumps here and there. I guess I had hoped it would come out evenly. wear a mask when you apply it, it goes all over even when you try to be careful and slow. I hope its worth the work to apply.I will update later."
1,Didnt work for me,"I had a caravan of ants coming up through the power outlet onto my kitchen counter. Through the Vine program I was offered this product. I had great hopes, thinking the timing couldn't be better for the test. I tried every combination of application over the course of a couple weeks and nothing worked. I even tried sprinkling the ants themselves, thinking maybe they would carry back to the next and eliminate them at the source. No such luck! I was almost of the opinion they liked this stuff. This product in my opinion failed at every level and in honesty cannot recommend."
3,Seemed to work for a day or two,"Annual ant problem. I used the DE powder around the foundation. It seemed to work for 2 or 3 days but the ants returned. I reapplied the product but it does not seem to work with this type of ant or perhaps it's where I am applying the powder. Either way, I have not been successful using the product."
5,Good Text Book,"This is a beautiful, well-laid out and easy to read book that covers all the basics of Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Taoism and Shinto. The contributors and editors all have excellent backgrounds in the study of these various religions. The text is extremely accessible and lends itself well to use as a text book in a college course."
5,Comprehensive and applicable,"The book treats many cases and reaches high level of coverage; it is very helpful, that in practice one can find many similarities, since the cases are very realistic and explained in depth. My opinion is, that it is valuable because it is applicable."
1,Inaccurate,"Inaccurate on ME (CFS). For example, it says there is no evidence to support immune dysfunction or virus as causes."
4,Very fine Randolph Scott Western,"A LAWLESS STREET has at least one quirky angle that makes it stand out among other Randolph Scott vehicles: Scott apparently is ""killed"" about half way through the action---only to come back towards the end to insure that justice is done. A LAWLESS STREET is always entertaining, filled with the requisite action, plot twists, and surprizes...Scott is superb as the town marshal, and Angela Lansbury as the visiting ""chanteuse"" adds definite interest (especially to those who remember her mostly from MURDER, SHE WROTE!). This is a fine Scott Western and deserves greater currency."
2,For completists only,"Packaging is nice and professional; however, the sound quality is unacceptable on this German import - it sounds like it was mastered from a beat-up vinyl record. Too bad, as there are some very interesting alternate versions of well-known Neil Young tracks on this long-unavailable album including versions of Alabam, Southern Man and Find the Cost of Freedom/Ohio. I imagine the best route to take for the real audiophile is to search out a vinyl copy in very good condition, as this is undoubtedly one of the worst sounding cd's in my collection. It is generally acknowledged that Journey Through the Past will probably never see the light of day in a digitally remastered format so, at this point, 'you get what you get.'"
4,Good book for cabinets,"Although the book is supposed to be for cabinet and shevling, it is clearly more about cabinets. Not good if you looking for ideas on interior fancy shelves. Very good if you looking to build interior cabinets."
4,Easy to work with.,"The Editorial Staff of Ortho Books, How to Plan and Build Bookcases, Cabinets, and Shelves (Ortho, 1987)How do you review a how-to book, really? I mean, as long as it does what it's supposed to do, and does it clearly, it's good, right? From that standpoint, this one's pretty much got it made. Clear descriptions, heavy on the illustration, step-by-step instructions, that sort of thing. I do wish it had gone into more detail on some of the optional stuff (especially face-framing; if you plan to do a lot of bookshelf-building that requires doors, you'll probably need another book as well), but for basic construction of shelving, this should do you right. Not much more to say. If you need it, you need it, if you don't, you don't. ***"
3,Feel-Good Christmas Story,"I love Luanne Rice. This book was a nice, short story, definitely not her best, as stated here by others, but she is a great author, and I'd recommend NOT giving up on her if this is your first book by her. ""Follow The Stars Home...."" Read that and you'll realize she's wonderful. But this little book was heart-warming, just not real exciting. Give it a try, however!"
3,Just missed the mark,"Normally I enjoy Luanne Rice novels and look forward to each new one, but after just finishing ""Silver Bells"" I have to say that for me it missed the mark. Yes, the story and nice and the ending is ""feel-good,"" but the characters are one-dimensional and it appears that Ms Rice didn't waste a lot of time writing this one. I hope her next one is better."
4,Best of the genre,"A little bit love story; a little bit suspense; a little bit paranormal. I'm not a lover of holiday books, but this one is definitely the best of the genre. A nice holiday read."
5,It's exactly what I want,"I ordered it on Jan 1st, and it came with other books on Jan 5th.Nothing beats it. Well, it totally beats my university bookstore."
1,Disappointed.,Disappointed because I never received this order. My college class is almost over and this was required reading. USPS tracking did not reveal a potential delivery date either.
3,Mustek VDC-300,"Very easy to use and set up with my Win98 was easy. Pictures in the high resolution are adequate for internet use. Software for editing is basic, but I set up my editing options with my Paint Ship Pro and it worked great. Price is reasonable but be aware that this is a discontinued item with the manufacture. One year warrenty though, so a good first basic digital camera."
5,Beating the Bark Beetes,"This book is easy to read and is full of helpful information about pine/conifer pests. According to the national news, bark beetles (along with the drought) are the main cause of the devastating forest fires in Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. Here in the Southwest, we have been experiencing a huge die-off of ponderosa pines and pinons, but until I purchased this book, I did not know how to protect my trees, much less how to identify which of my trees might be in the initial stages of insect attack. I was able to save virtually all of them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has any type of pine/conifer on their property."
5,"Magnificent . . . Good traditional music, an angelic voice and a perfect sound","Celtic Music's Girl of the Golden West has here created an album that sums up what she is all about. There is integrity in the integration of the artist's personal vision with the legacies of the past, and in her solidarity with the outstanding supporting band . . . Connie rings heart rending here. Her singing indeed is a great communicator. Like a Renaissance history painter, Connie Dover masterfully brings this historic legacy to life with the beauty of her voice and the skill of her delivery coupled with the accuracy of her research . . . A painter once said that to arrive at truths you have to lie a little. Here, Connie Dover has told the truth and arrived at artistic truth at all levels of understanding."""
5,Loved it!,"I have all of Connie Dover's CDs (some in multiple fomats so I can listen to tapes in the car, CDs at home, etc.) They've gotten me through many a road trip.Border of Heaven is a wonderful addition to the collection. The music traces the connections between traditional Celtic music and early American folk music. The songs range a bit further afield than her usual, primarily Celtic, offerings, but her voice is as crystalline as always and the music shows wonderful range and creative flair.I would recommend this CD to anybody interested in beautiful folk music. If you're a Celtic purist you might want to start with her earlier releases, but you really shouldn't miss out on this one.Connie, if you're reading this, when are you coming to Minnesota?"
2,Quackers the Duck,"Ever since I saw this duck, I thought it was adorable. However, the duck that had caught my eye was one that was much larger, and when I saw this one, I bought it, thinking that it was the same duck. The duck that arrived via mail was less than 6 inches tall, and a waste of six dollars, if you ask me. They should clearly state the size of the duck, and make sure that people know the difference between this duck, and the one that I was hoping to buy. Unfortunately, I can't even buy the real duck that I wanted (also named Quackers the Duck, TY Doll), because I'm on a budget, and can't afford ten dollars to buy this duck. I'm not satisfied, but can't return it, because I opened the package (there was no other way to tell that it was going to be a puny duck), and can't return it (and would lose a dollar or more from shipping). I'm very disappointed in this product."
3,Little duck,"I love the Ty animals. My granddaughter will not go anywhere or sleep without ""Duck"". Her duck is wearing out so I ordered this thinking of a replacement. When I received it, it was a very small duck. I cannot use it as a replacement but she likes to play with the duck. That was my own fault for not reading closely about the size. The seller sent this in a very timely manner and in very good condition. I would order from them again. I would just read more about the product than I did the first time."
2,Check the size!,"We purchased this as a toy for one of our dogs. He had a LARGE duck when he was a puppy and would carry it around all the time. Unfortunately,it was left behind in our travels. I didn't check the size when I ordered it so I was SHOCKED to see how tiny it was!"
3,Quackers the Duck is OK,"If you are into collecting Ty Beanies and want a duck, this is the one. Mine came with tag and tag protector intact. A little pricey, but made the wife happy."
2,Smells like incense sticks,I was wanting to buy a jasmine fragrance for a long time... My sister had a Jasmine perfume but I could'nt recall the name so I searched randomly on amazon and came across this one... I read the reviews and bought it.. However I dont like it as it smells like Incense sticks... Later on I bought Pur Desir de gardenia and nothing can beat the perfume...Its awesome...I dont recommed this perfume....
1,shockingly bad,"When I purchased this cd I thought I would hear a great compililation, similar in stature to her previous works. Unfortunately this was probably the worst cd I have ever seen, with nearly ever song being completely bland. Nothing of merit was recorded here and you would be a fool to buy it"
4,"A bit ""edgy""","I really like the quality, but the edges of the cutout are sharp. It gets caught in fabricks easily. I took a small nail file and smoothed it out a bit."
2,"Great Title, great pictures, too cluttered","I was looking forward to receiving this book. I am a dietitian and am always looking for ways to encourage vegetables and fruits to parents and children. The exterior and interior of this book are very colorfull and attractive. But the text is dissapointing for several reasons: too cluttered, too much information on recipes for fruits (many kids will eat them in their natural form or cut creatively), some recipes with too many ingredients, use of unfamiliar language (such as calling the seeds of fruit 'pips'), and confusing use of serving sizes (using 'handfulls'). The stickers in the back are a nice touch that kids will relate to. Thanks for trying!"
1,"Messy, does not live up to claim","Everytime I attempt to make this product work, I'm left with disatrous results. The formula is very runny and the brush is of a quite useless design. In combination they create clumpy lashes. When dry the tint ""crumbles"" off and it wears away if anything in a much less graceful fashion than other mascaras, leaving crusty, half coated lashes. Removal is a pain, I always loose several lashes and it takes quite a bit of effort. Very drying to lashes as well."
3,"Fun, Creepy & Stupid! -- coulrophobics beware!","Yes fellow horror fans ""We All Scream For Ice Cream"" is on the cheesy side of horror(although Forsythe is excellent as both good guy/bad guy versions of Buster the clown). The film is just littered with bad dialog oozing from the mouths of the other players, but when you mix it in with the creepy story and the goofy tongue & cheek way that buster kills off his victims you can't help but be reminded of another fun 80's clown flick loaded with cheese in ""Killer Clowns From Outer Space"". Speaking of the 80's, if this film was made back then it would have fit in perfect with the times and something tells me it would be one of those fun cult classic movies from the 80's that horror fans(like myself) would be eagerly waiting on it's dvd release. Could have been much better but I enjoyed it for what it was...fun,creepy & stupid!"
1,"ice scream, you scream we all scream for a refund","The best part of this movie is the picture on the cover, it makes the film look scary, i mean how can you go wrong with a killer clown?Easy, you make this film. This movie is not in the slightest way scary and I would find it hard for someone to tell me it's anything but a kids PG rated goosebumps episode.Masters Of Horror? pffftt... There is nothing scary about a direct knock off of Stephen Kings IT.... the only plot change is that years ago the kids picked on the clown and un-intentionally killed him, now the clowns back for revenge by giving there kids ice creams that when they eat them there parents melt into a puddle of ice cream.I don't even wanna think about the things that did not make sense, just avoid the movie, it is 55 minutes of boredom and not one single scare."
2,Lame,"Mildly entertaining but also very bland 95% of the time. The ice cream man was more comical than scary. The ice cream man was killed at the end of the movie, yet, he comes back amazingly and looks at the audience and says [we all scream] ""FOR ICE CREAM"" and then the film ends. Nice way to say ""screw you"" to the audience. What a joke."
3,Entertaining,"I didn't think this was too bad of a movie. It was definitely entertaining. It wasn't petrifying but most of the newer Masters of Horror movies aren't really scary.Personally, I like ""b"" killer-clown horror movies so that's probably why I thought this movie was entertaining. This movie is more of a renter, I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you want to buy the whole collection."
2,An Ice Cream Man is back from the dead to exact revenge,"This actually wasn't all that bad. It wasn't scary but it did have an interesting story line somewhat similar to Stephen Kings ""IT"". It may be worth checking out if you aren't expecting too much in the way of horror, and it's only 57 minutes long."
3,"So close, but","I purchased this case for a Nokia E61. The phone fits perfectly inside. The only problem I have, is that the magnet on the body was too low. The flap magnet could not reach the magnet on the body, causing the flap to be loose and unsecure. I don't know if my phone was too long for the case, but the case is very high quality. I might do some surgery and add a magnet or add velcro. Another thing, the belt clip has a too large gap. Again I will have to fix it by bending it... :/ If you are handy, for the price...it is worth fixing."
5,Perfect transaction.,Very fast delivery. Once again the moral is: Don't pay extra for expedited shipping unless it's overnight.
5,Great Healing Aid !,"This is a great product for all those hard to heal spots. Great for over worked hands with nicks from the garden or scratches from pets too! We use Colloidal Silver as defense against infection around our house (only second to vinegar wash), to treat most every 'hurt', now we've added a great soap too."
1,"Great author, bad editorial house","I bought these book and awaited anxiously for it's arrival since I am almost finished reading ""El Evangelio Según el Espiritismo"". As soon as the book arrived, I opened the envelope and went through the pages to find a poorly edited book. It doesn't follow the APA, or any standard for that matter, that I know for a book. I decided to buy the book from another editorial house, and donate this one to anyone who wants it. I won't buy any other books from Plaza Editorial again, unless I can see the contents beforehand."
4,Page Turner!,"I am only 1/2 way through, but I thought I would share that I only started it yesterday! Once you start reading, you can't stop! I am really enjoying it so far. The only thing I do not like is the constant references to a religion and language I know nothing about.A good read for those who liked ""The Secret Life of Bees"" by Sue Monk Kidd, ""The Lovely Bones"" by Alice Sebold, and ""She's Come Undone"" by Wally Lamb."
2,Not that great...,"Maybe I missed something... I didn't think this book was as captivating as everyone else seems to. I didn't feel attached to the characters, and much preferred Leila Aboulela's novel, The Translator, which is a similar story but somehow more gripping.""Sweetness"" is a bit deceptive."
4,Book Club Read,"This book was read in my book club. 11 of us discussed it. The book averaged an 8 with ratings from 7.5 to 8.5. We all enjoyed reading a book which presented Islam in a nice way. So many books focus on the repression of women in Islam and Muslim culture that it was refreshing to read of a woman who relished her religion and religious views. Most of us liked Lilly and some found her ""spunky"". We liked learning about Ethopia and felt this was an excellent book for book clubs. We had one who said she'd probably forget the book and certainly wouldn't read it again, yet others felt exactly opposite. (Personally, I think this is a sign of a good book.)"
2,"Misleading picture, glossy glaze!","I am very disappointed at the glossy glaze of this heavy, cheap looking ceramic. The picture looks like matte stoneware and its color on the picture is much better than, what I got. The actual color is yellowish going into greenish rather than advertized cappuccino. In addition, there is a quite visible flaw in the external finish on one side, as if somobody tried to fill in tiny pits and filed the excess down. Definitely would not pass my quality control check, regardless of color and finish.I ordered several accessories in this series to complement my stoneware dishes and have to return them all. The other items do have quality control sticker, no flaws in the finish."
4,NOT COMING OUT YET..........AGAIN,"Fefe Dobson's album is not going to be released today because she is no longer with her record label Island/Def Jam.so as of yet there is no release date, so i disappointed again I just hope it comes out soon."
5,AWESOME,"i absolutely adore fefe dobson. my favorite songs from this ablum most def. are DONT LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD, HOLE, and THIS IS MY LIFE.i seriously wish that this ablum would come out already. ive been waitin for it to come out for what seems like forever.the way she dresses and her make up and hair...everything about her i absolutely love. i think she is amazing."
3,Great shots. Nothing much to learn,"I purchased this book because i was interested in photographing light & more particularly without filters. The author demonstrates here with his excellent photos that one can take great TRUE COLOR pictures without modifying with filters. Good job! Some of the pictures are awesome!But, very unfortunately, Ken talks more about his feelings, experience etc rather than about how the reader can achieve / take similar photos. He never talked about the technical aspects of those great shots! I dont remember seeing one picture having its exposure & shutter settings!!To put in a nut shell, after reading the book, you will realise it is possible to take great pictures without costly equipment & filters - still retaining the true colour on the atmosphere!! Great! But the question of 'How to take such pictures & its technical consideration' are unanswered & unexplained. A bit of disappointment."
5,Sulky 12 inch by 11 Yard Tear Easy Stabilizer Roll,Sulky in every way is always the best.. I am totally satisfied with product and will buy it again. I have never been disappointed in Sulky products
5,Great Lantern Case,"I bought this case for my Coleman NorthStar lantern. The lantern (lantern head assembly and stabilizer base unit) fits nicely in the case. This case is not designed to hold the propane bottle, which I do think most buyers understand. There is room for extra mantle storage at the bottom of the case. Good protection for your lantern."
3,Fit could be better,"This case doesn't fit my lantern very well, I have to wrap the lantern in a towell before putting it in the case to keep it from rattling around. But since the carboard box the lantern was originally stored in disintegrated after a rainy camping trip, this will have to do."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The book is informative and does cover the material on the cover of the book, but I was looking for different ways of cleaning the various types of fish ( although I guess there aren't really that many ). The books really only spends a few pages on the fish cleaning, an internet search would probably be equivalent. But then again it wasn't very expensive ( used )."
4,Good form fitting cap,This hat fits snug and low to your head like an old cap that you had worn for years. I like the look.
3,1974 Cooperstown franchise fitted braves cap,"Overall, it's a good hat. However, I expected the hat to be a bit more sturdy that it is. It's a lot more flimsy than other fitted hats that I own."
4,A must for Donna Summer fans,"This is a great album which spans Donna's entire career and showcases all the great songs from the 70s, 80s, 90s up to today. I don't think there is a single song on here which isn't fantastic and it was interesting to hear some her non-dance tracks from the early 80s when she was re-inventing her sound.If you're a true Donna Summer fan, you must go out and get this."
5,Some say GOLD i say PERFECTION.,Sound quality A+Song collection A+Satisfaction A+Certified Perfection.
2,Stick With the 1993 Anthology!,"Well, these greatest hits albums just don't get it right. This one unlike the awesome 1993 Anthology seems to favor her 80's work over her (best) work, her work from the 1970's.I do have to say that having the 6 minute version of MacArthur Park is one plus to this collection, since the single version feels disconnected, missing Part 2 of the song. But still, for this, go to the 1993 Anthology. At least that one includes Rumour Has It and Once Upon a Time.I guess, for those who like her non-disco stuff better, this is for you, so, I guess there's two sides to it. Personally, though, this one lacks compared to the Anthology."
4,"I LOVE Disc One, but Disc Two is too exhaustive of a collection!","Well, I wanted remastered Donna Summer disco music, so I ordered the ""Gold"" two-disc set. I am happy that disc one is entirely 1970s Summer! But, by the end of disc two, I had a headache! So, I probably won't even listen to disc two (at least beyond the first few songs) on a regular basis. I think the music lost me around 1983/4. Anyway, the collection sounds terrific, despite my complaint. It is a very thorough compilation of songs from Donna Summer's career in music. I noticed in the cd booklet that about 6 cds have been released from the '70s disco period. I might look into those albums to get more of the Donna Summer that I love. Overall, this is not a bad buy. I would just hope that others would have a greater appreciation for the dance club music that followed the original disco. I find it annoying, but I've said enough. Disc One RULES!!!"
4,MGB,A very interesting and well written book. Not overwhelmed with technical details.If your interested in MGB's history this is the one to read
1,ZERO STARS! WHAT A MESS!,"I can't believe I have the same book the other reviewers here have! Of the five projects we've tried, none of them worked. The fruit leather, which might be in book 2, is a complete catastrophe and ruined an expensive plate. The bathtub finger paints were 1. a hideous mess and 2. no fun because they were just too runny. The sponge ball has lousy directions and wouldn't stay together. As for the silly putty, it was nearly impossible to find liquid starch and once we did the stuff was so runny you wcouldn't do anything with it! When I wrote to the authors at the email address provided, they never answered (though since it was AOL to AOL I know they got the email). So disappointing."
4,Seller ships promptly at holiday time!,This book arrived in time for Christmas gifting and was in excellent condition.
1,Lag in delivery negated need for product,"The book arrived 19 days after it was purchased. It was purchased to generate ideas for our daughter's birthday party and arrived after the party date. Seller tells me 19 days is an acceptable wait time, so no refund. What a shame."
1,Haven't received order!!!!!,It's rather hard to review the product. I ordered from Kid Concoctions over a month ago and still haven't received my order and they won't reply to my emails.
3,Cheap? No way!,"I got the Ultimate Book of Kids Concoctions for an early Christmas present. Before getting the book I watched an TV show about the book and it said that you could make these crafts for pennies. After looking at all of the recipes, that is not true! Many things I had around the kitchen but are not cheap!! Overall this is a wonderful craft book for kids except for the prices."
3,Less meaty than I expected,"There are lots of children's bibles to choose from, and it can be difficult (and subjective) to find the right one. After looking at other user reviews, I thought this one might have enough Bible characters and enough story to give my four-year-old a foundation. While it's definitely better than many I've seen, it's still a little skimpy on story for me, though it's better than any I've found so far.As for violence mentioned by another reviewer-- it's still the Bible. There's violence in the Bible. One way to get Bible stories without any violence would be to carefully select Bible stories separately in picture books. Some Bible stories do not contain violence."
1,My first picture bible Stories,This is terrible!! Far to much info and violence for such a young age.
2,Putting the spectacular first.,"The full title on this book's cover reads: ""Life in the Oceans - The Spectacular World of Whales, Dolphins, Giant Squid, Sharks and other unusual Sea Creatures."" I was, therefore expecting to find the section on Whales at the beginning - but straight away we are into the Great White Shark with it's great white teeth on the opening page.This is an oversized book containing 125 pages of text and colour photographs. The images are not as exciting as I have come to expect from this author - who is renowned for her own photography.Altogether something of a disappointment. Perhaps a smaller format would have fared better.NM"
4,Very nice,"I've been trying to get the BBC to issue this in the UK for a long time, but no luck, so I'm glad to have this very nice edition of a classic spooky BBC serial. It was fascinating and creepy when first shown (and I'm old enough to remember that), and the synopsis is good - I hope a new generation is encouraged to view it."
1,Don't waste your money,I did not like this book. I was expecting so much more. It was pretty much lame poems and short stories. I wanted more of real life stories. I didn't learn anything from it.
5,Tera Nova,I loved this movie when it was on TV and I can still watch it now when ever I get the urg.
5,This is a great show!,"The acting is strong, the action is amazing, the scenery is beautiful, the evil was believable and palpable and it is full of surprises - non stop entertainment for the whole family and no 4-letter words - whew, what a relief! Produced by Steven Spielberg and Peter Chernin. I have watched the first season and then bought the box set, it was that good. And they cancelled it??? What morons!!!! Kevin Reilly is Chairman of Entertainment for the Fox Broadcasting Company is the guy to hate. This was the best series in years."
5,Would have loved a season 2,"This series are full of adventure, fiction and for sure great animations, the downfall was to know that there's not gonna be a season 2, I got sooooo upset, but anyway, the point is to review season 1 and I really recommend it, you will be seeing one chapter after another continously."
5,Watched series online,"I didn't buy this DVD but I watched the Terra Nova series online. It was brilliant! There was action and romance, and danger. I got caught up in the series and tossed about at every unexpected twist.I can't believe FOX is giving it up now!Although there are only 11 episodes so far, it was an amazing series. I only hope FOX doesn't leave us hanging."
5,Season 2 Cancelled 6 Mar. 2012,"As of March 6, 2012 the television series Terra Nova has been cancelled by Fox. For such an awesome start the series had a good idea. The episodes were engaging and many future concepts were placed into the series. I know that our three young sons they will be very disappointed to see such an awesome show.Fox has pulled some stupid moves before. And their biggest blunder is cancelling many of their stations that once carried FOX. If anything, Fox is becoming more mediocre and I am one viewer who is finding that CBS is showing more and more engaging shows. Ie. Blue Bloods, NCIS Miami, the Mentalist, and Hawaii 50.You are sinking Fox. Perhaps, you should hire UPN/WB again to make more shows. Then again, many stations that once carred UPN/WB are now Fox Stations. Since you have cancelled Space Above and Beyond I place little faith in your poor selection of shows."
5,BRING TERRA NOVA BACK!,"I absolutely love this show! It's so captivating, exciting, complicated and everything in a television show that I want to watch. It's really sad that they cut the show because of the amount of viewers. Maybe FOX should have allowed the season to really get going. People have jobs, and families, and other day to day things going on and can't always watch the show when it's being aired. That's why Netflix is so wonderful.. I first watched Terra Nova when it came out on Netflix and fell in love, literally. I am so sad it won't be aired again. I am going to buy the box set to hopefully help support the cause. I honestly would do anything to help get the show going on a season two, with the full cast."
3,Big Mistake,"The box cover is wrong. It's supposed to say ""The Complete ""INCOMPLETE"" Series"".Fairly good show .. to bad it got canceled."
2,Terra Nova,"Just finished watching the only season. I know this is simply a movie and anything can happen in movies; however, couldn't stop thinking as I watched that what they were doing in the past was changing the future no matter how far back they went. As I said this was only a movie but having said that it would have been good to stick to as much science as possible. What we do or have done affects the future one way or the other. There would have been no going back and forth to the same future they left because all would have changed. The first interference to the past would have immediately changed the future.These writers totally ignored facts, science and simple reality. Thumbs down on this series and is good they ended it or better to not have started."
1,A complete and utter joke!,They cancelled the series and now they have the nerve to sell a DVD that is INCOMPLETE!!! What a joke. You won't get a dime out of my pocket to buy this.
2,How could you compare this to Firefly?,"This show was a great idea. As a huge fan of SF I wanted to like this. It was horrible. Someone even compared it to Firefly. Firefly was one of the few good SF TV series ever made. There was creativity, an interesting Universe, great characters, and interesting questions to find answers too. There were great scrips and good acting.Terra Nova had none of these things. I admit I only watched half of the season because I couldn't watch such a missed opportunity anymore. I believe the main failure was the scrips and ideas were set up for 8-12 year old children instead of adults. Maybe next time we will get some decent SF."
1,Every Decision They Made Was Wrong,"From showing Obama money in the first episode, to flipping the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker dynamic and thinking it's ""original"" there is nothing to redeem this dog of a production from Spielberg.A little Jurassic Park, a dash of 24, throw in a little tribal war, and you've got a creative mess. Should have never hit the airwaves when there is so much real SF that could be adapted for TV. To say this could have been better is an understatement.Utter dreck."
1,HATE,"I thought it was awful, it made me feel sad as soon as I finished the first episode of the crumb dump piece of doo doo film."
5,"Excellent DVD TV series, FOX pulled a boner","Excellent TV series, not sure why it was cancelled since it was a very unique take on starting over. Really wish this series would of stayed on tv since it was so unique & the actors involved were very good, espically the 2 lead male actors; Stephan Lange & Jason O'Mara. FOX really pulled a boner cancelling this series, it was interesting& entertaining. And deserved to be given a chance to find it's viewership, atleast a 2nd season. FOX executivesare real bone heads & DON""T deserve to say who gets cancelled, the viewership should. Really wish this was a longer tv series but i still enjoy watching it."
5,Excellent,Excellent show starts a little slow but get real good quickly to bad it was canceled and not picked up by someone else. I recomend this to other scifi fans.
1,I couldn't play it because it was only playable for the usa,I couldn't play it because it was only playable for the usaCan I send it back and you send me one I can play?
2,"The art is attractive, but the storytelling is awful.","During walks, I saw a poster of this series on passing metro buses. It was hypnotically attractive.When the series came out on DVD, I rented it. But despite the colorful, attractive cover on the DVD case, and despite the interesting time travel theme, the screenwriting was terrible. Characters say things they would not really say in their circumstances, and characters behave in ways they would not really behave. The cinematography is colorful and some of the special effects are impressive, as is the set direction. But those things are empty framework if you don't fill in the spaces with characters behaving convincingly.A rudimentary conceptual framework is not enough, even if it is one involving time travel, dinosaurs, and a cool-looking home base. What the twelve episodes of this cancelled series needed was a screenwriter who BELIEVED--in his world, in his story, and in his characters."
5,Terra nova best Sci fi program since Stargate,"Terra nova is the best Sci fi program since Stargate, even though it started slow it's finally is brilliant and it should be renewed.As Spielberg is part of it I don't see why he doesn't fund it."
3,They aren't meant to be functional pants -- they're meant to *look* like they are,"These are not actual fatigues. Granted I only half expected them to be useful as such, but I had hoped. It's very difficult to find women's pants that are.If you are buying these expecting something that *looks* like these pants and fits/wears/acts like most other women's pants you can buy in a clothing store, then here you go. They're relatively comfortable but feel kind of cheap.But if you are looking for pants that function like actual fatigues (but with a women's cut) or pants for outdoor activities (hiking, paintball, ROTC, etc.) then these are not for you. They are fashion pants. (note: If you are looking for functional women's BDUs go check out 511 Tactical)"
5,Technology meets simplicity,"""Small"" measurements:- turning part: 3"" x 3""- black part of handle including stainless rim: 6 1/2"" x 1""- entire length: 11 1/2""This spatula has a very thin edge, making getting under foods easy without tearing them apart.I like the rubbery feel of the heat resistant handle and the weight of it in my hand - it is light yet balanced.The stainless finish is easily cleaned.I wish Amazon sold this one without the slots and in all sizes so I could have them all!"
1,????,I have one of these that I purchased at Walmart years ago for under $20. I have no idea why you are charging so high for it.. Over $200???? C'mon..
5,Hilarious!,"This book was given to my 4 year old son recently, and he absolutely howls with laughter everytime we read it. The irony is not lost on him at all. He laughs so much, he usually has the hiccups by the time we read how Boodil is barely restraining herself from tearing the vacuum cleaner to pieces, while the picture shows Boodil cowering under the couch as the vacuum is pushed toward her. This book is my son's new favorite, and one of my favorites too."
4,Over the rainbow,"""Barnstormer in Oz"" is the late Philip Jose Farmer's fascinating take on the magical land. Farmer does some revisionist history--it's as if the Wonderful Wizard of Oz never had any sequels. The Scarecrow still reigns in the Emerald City, Glinda the Good is again battling an evil witch. Oz is on the verge of civil war. Into the story flies Hank Stover, Dorothy Gale's son. He finds out he is in a parallel universe. He marries and impregnates one woman while romancing Glinda on the side. Their passionate love affair sets the stage for crucial events.""Barnstormer"" is a unique contribution to the Oz canon. Farmer attempts some scientific explanations for talking animals, sentient objects, and whether there was reproduction in that magical land. It stands out as one of Farmer's most accessible books.Philip Jose Farmer will be remembered as a revolutionary science fiction author. (1918-2009)"
3,Super Reader,"A pilot hits a funny green cloudy thing and just like his mum, is not in Kansas anymore, even without the annoying dog.Farmer's book, as the subtitle suggests, comes out with some pseudoscientific entertaining stuff to explain all the whackiness in oz. Adventure with witches ensues."
5,Tenchi's end is here....or isn't?,"I was so sad when I knew Tenchi's final episodes were near.This ending is very dramatic and very fitting to the whole story.Many secrets are reveal in these final episodes leding us thinking,why didn't I think of that?I was amaze by the way they organized the story.I have to say that my favorite part was when the serie take us again to the beggining where all really started making the story take a new sence.You don't want to miss what really happened to Tenchi and his friends at the end of the story,now do you?I totally recomend this one to you."
4,Easy to setup with base station,"This phone is convenient and easy to use. I like the fact that I cantransfer my Phone book from the base unit without having to go throughthe tedious task of entering each entry letter by letter. I have threeseparate handsets, besides the base unit."
1,Only 1 of 2 handsets worked,"I purchased 2 handsets of this model, charged the batteries according to spec, and then tried to register them with the base unit. Only 1 would register, the other never did.I tried to contact the seller, but no response. I bought these 2 replacement handsets because of problems with 2 of the original 3, purchased over 1 year ago. I have since disconnected the Uniden system, and purchased an vtech unit, which I am much more pleased with."
5,Uniden DCX750 Additional handset,I ordered this refurbished handset to complete needs around my house. When it came I was delighted to see it looked new and never used. It wsa so easy to set up and install but the proof came when we started using it. It worked very well and happy we ordered it as refurbished. I recieved it very timely. Uniden puts out a great telephone.
3,"Nice Phone, Very Poor Support",This phone is a add on to an existing Uniden cordless phone system at my house. I wanted to import to the new handset the telephone numbers already stored in my original Uniden cordless phone system. I sent several emails to Uniden customer support on how to move my stored telephone numbers into the new handset. Uniden still has not given me the instructions and I requested help about 2 weeks ago. I'm still waiting and don't have much expectation that Uniden will come through with the instructions.
4,"Works just fine, but registration difficult","The handset does everything it's supposed to do, and was much less expensive to purchase than the accessory handset that goes with my DCT6465 base unit. Registering the handset to the base unit was a bit difficult because an important step had been left out of the manual. My first call to Uniden was of no help; I called a second time, had a different person, and she told me right away the necessary steps to register the handset. From then on, everything was fine."
4,Great product for the price,"Looked at several higher-priced cases and this one was the best quality for the price....soft foam at the top to help protect club heads, streamline, easy to tote on the casters and the TSA approved security locks are solid. Good product."
2,Too small,Too small for most bags. They really should quit selling this bag as it is just too small to use.
4,Great travel case.,"Very good travel case. Fit clubs, shoes, balls for the weekend. only possible downside is it is a bit difficult to close when overstuffed. however, it closes and works great. very happy with this purchase."
1,Bad Latch Design,"When I received this item, everything appeared to be well-assembled, and of good quality. However when I tested out the latches, the middle latch would not engage like the two end latches. The middle latch would lock with the key, but if you did not lock it, it could easily be pulled open. Upon examination of the middle latch, I came to believe that it is a flawed design. There is a nut holding the lock mechanism together that seems to prevent the latch from fully closing. I believe this design could easily be corrected, but until it is, this item gets just one star! Returned for a refund...!"
4,All you need,"Took this case on a golf trip to Florida. No problem and it held up well. It was not big enough to hold my cart bag, so I used my walking bag which was no big deal. I got my bag and shoes in it and that was pretty much it. It would not fit in the trunk of my Sebring convertible or the car I rented which had a fairly nice trunk. That could be a problem if you need the back seat for something or someone else. However, I can't imagine a hard cover being any smaller. If you only use it occasionally and don't want to spend the extra $50 or more dollars for a bigger case, this one is for you."
1,Useless,"This product is petroleum jelly and mineral oil, neither of which does anything to speed the healing process. And, as another reviewer noted, petroleum jelly can worsen the stye by blocking oil glands and tear ducts.If you feel that you must put petroleum jelly or mineral oil in your eyelid for some reason, just buy some Vaseline or mineral oil. That will cost you about 1/5 as much as this product."
1,Doesn't Work - Save your $$!,"Developed a stye on a Friday and by that Sunday, I was in such terrible pain I figured I'd try this product. So not worth the $10 I paid. It's says right on the box it's not designed to cure a stye, only to lessen the irritation - which it did not do anyway. If anything, it made my vision blurry and my eye burn and water more. No relief like the product promised. Will not be purchasing again (and, in fact, will be contacting the manufacturer to see about getting a refund)."
1,Look elsewhere,"After successfully testing 1 roll through the camera at home, the camera broke before my first dive on vacation. The motor drive would not load the film correctly. I bought the cheapest encased point and shoot camera at the dive shop, which worked well."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this camera to take to the Keys on a snorkeling trip. I made sure to load the film when I arrived in FL, I was careful with the rubber ring so as to insure a tight seel and still the camera leaked. I was never attempting a picture at a depth further than a few feet. What a crappy camera. I wasted two rolls of film and four batteries before I just gave up...save your money, I wish I had!"
2,Prone to leaks,"The first time I used it, I noticed that it was starting to fog up inside the housing. I opened it and sure enough there was some water inside. The second time, using the extra rubber ring that was provided, I noticed water leaked inside again. It seemed to take a little longer this time (30 minutes) and didn't fog up. I used it snorkeling (no underwater dives), so the max depth the camera could have been at was 5 feet. Fortunately, there was not enough water to get inside the camera body and into the film compartment. I believe that if I had taken it to about 45 feet, like the previous reviewer did, that it would have also flooded.I guess all I can say is beware.Pros are: It is much cheaper than the next model from the same company, has a flash, automatic film advance, and a nice strap."
3,Good package to start with.,"I have used this camera on about a dozen dives to 85 feet and several snorkle trips with satisfactory results and no leaks. Just be sure to keep the seal clean and to inspect it closely after closing to ensure you did not pinch or roll the seal. It's easy to handle and simple to operate in the water. After a couple hundred photos, I made a significant upgrade to a DC600, but the SL300 was a great package for me to be sure the large investment to upgrade would be worthwhile (and to give me confidence in the DC600 housing). My biggest complaint is that the flash button is automatically activated by pressure and the flash is always on below about 20 feet. This drains the battery as well as removes the option to not use the flash. Also, remember after shooting a roll of film, the rewind is motorized, but not automatic."
3,"Good, solid playing","Lili Kraus is a great pianist with a broad dynamic pallette and absolute control. Her literal, granitic approach strikes some as being transcendant and soaring, but I felt that both the Beethoven and Haydn could use more irony and spontanaety. Unexpectedly, the Chopin stood out as the most striking playing. The Bartok feels ""modern"" (unlike Bartok's own performances during the same time period), with hard, unyielding sonority and rhythm."
1,poor copy,"Most of the books that I have purchased from Amazon have been in Good to Very Good condition. Unfortunately, the workbook/lab manual to accompany Deux Mondes was not only dirty but was missing the first few chapters. Is it possible to exchange it for a slightly cleaner copy? Can one be sent to me and can I return this manual? Like I stated, this is the first book of at least four dozen books that I have purchased from Amazon that was unacceptable. Thank you."
2,sorely disappointed,"As a fan of the X-Men and all the other X-titles, I was sorely disappointed in this graphic novel.The beginning, which featured a baseball game with the residents of X-Mansion, was perhaps the only best thing of the entire novel. After that, it just went downhill!The battle with the Fury just simply bored me. The Fury, to me, was simply a repackaged version of the Sentinels or Nimrod. Except this time, it's...well, computer vs. computer (Sage).Murderworld...should have stayed buried in the past.Blah!"
2,Binding of the Book,"I like the contents of the book just fine. The print is easy to read, and the poems are laid out nicely. But the glued binding of this book is going to go quickly. The first time I opened the book I could feel its flimsiness. Soon, I am sure, I'm going to be left with nothing but chunks of book.Are there not any books that are still stitched together?Christiana Mollin"
3,I am looking for a song,"I been looking for a song for a long time called no voy a mover un dedo i think it is pop or rock in spanish I will like to know more info on this cd since this might be it, was that song created at least 7 years ago?, if somebody knows who sing that song or if this is it letme know hint the singers were a short and tall men I think. thank you."
1,Severe Defects!!,"I bought one 5 years ago, it was good. Then I bought 4 morerecently to gift away in November 2009. All 4 came in withsevere leaks at the rivets. It was unbelievable. It was makingsizzling sound at the stove when I was cooking. It turned outthat liquid was leaking from the rivets onto the heating element of thestove. I tried all 4 pans, and all leaked the same way.I contacted both Amazon and KitchenAid immediately for this problem."
4,"Great for Hardwood, Average for Carpet","This is the best vacuum I've ever had or used for a hardwood floor, I recommend this to anyone who has lots of hardwood floor to vacuum. However, it's pretty average on carpet and doesn't do any better than a 20 dollar Walmart vacuum."
2,total disappointment,doesn't stay upright. Middle heavy and too much money for something well made but useless. I love vacuums but this one went right back.
1,regretful,"It's heavy and cumbersome to use, it doesn't cover much space so it takes longer to vacuum, it doesn't reach too far, it's very disappointing and a waste of money. My husband, both kids, and myself really don't like this vacuum."
5,great for hardwood floors,We live in a large condominium with all hardwood floors. The Miele S163 works great for a place like ours...it sucks up all the junk messing up our floors... crumbs and dust are completely gone with a quick swipe--it's really light and has a long cord --and has a lot of power. We have a few area rugs and it cleans them really well. We recommend this vacuum -
3,A bit dissapointed,"I bought this to open up my macbook pro, but whenever you don't press hard enough, the screws strip and so does the screw driver, thus leaving you with stripped screws, and the burden of buying a bigger screw driver. I recommend the #00 phillips."
4,Pets can open this container,It's a great item. lightweight but sturdy and still easy to lift when full. If you store pet food in this know that cats and dogs can open it. It is possible to latch it.
2,Poor quality,"I use these to store pet food. I have 3 stacked on each other. They are difficult to pour a heavy bag of food into because of the slant requiring you to poor it in sideways rather than from the top. Yet, I've been able to make this system work reasonably well for a little over a year. Now the bins are starting to bow, a lot. It won't be long before one splits or the tower falls over. I'm looking for new bins, planning to get the kind that are stackable but allow filling from the top, and not this brand."
3,nice but does not seal very tightly,"I like this product and it works for what I use it for,which is to store dry dog food, but I wish the door made a tighter seal over the opening when in a closed position. Seeing as though I open and close the door 3 times a day to feed my dog, I'm not concerned about keeping the dry dog food real fresh,but if you wanted to keep cereal in something like this for extended lengths of time, I would suggest finding something with an airtight seal because this door is loose fitting and not even close to being airtight."
5,Great product,This is exactly what my son and his wife wanted for their dog food because of the front opening. We could not find it in any of the area stores. Delivery was quick and the storage container was just as I had thought it would be.
5,A different kind of bowl.,The bowls are unique and different looking. They serve their purpose and are well made.
2,1 Year + 2 days: R.I.P.,"After spending considerable time configuring, updating firmware, and deciphering manuals, I thought I was in the clear. Although the ""wireless option"" was, shall we say, ""disappointing"", the wired configuration was providing a great view of Lake Winnipesaukee from my office window (for MSIE users, that is; Firefox/Opera browsers are not supported) until 1 year and 2 days from date of purchase. The camera sensed the warranty expiration and is now completely dead (well, pan and tilt still work, but what's the point?). D-Link support suggested I buy a new one. I will. I found a nifty Panasonic camera that looks very promising. The 5300W goes in the bin with my previously-failed D-Link Router and D-link switch."
2,"Wait, wait, wait","After half a day of debugging and well meaning and courteus but poor tech support from D-Link I am returning the product. It has looks and behavior of a young product meant for early adopters. Since I need it for security I cannot be in debugging mode. There are many bugs each one of them jeopardizing the purpose of operating a security camera. Also, in previous reviews there is no mention of the sorry quality of the security application provided with the product. Unstable, clumsy, incomplete, unsupported.If you want to teach yourself the technological pits of wireless video and security go ahead. Otherwise wait, wait, wait."
3,D-Link DCS-5300W,"This item is a discontinued model from D-Link and I knew it when I bought it. The seller has been helpful and D-Link email tech support has been helpful also, albeit rather slow in response. Yet, I have not been able to get it working wirelessly. I am still continuing to work with tech support and hope to get it resolved soon. I have been out of town on business the past few weeks and my computer has not been working correctly. I hope it will be back in office this week and I can continue to reslove the issue."
4,"Good Camera, but need to know how to config.","Pros: It is good camera, Sharp picture, remote control, digital zoom is average (need to download latest software 1.02)Cons: Tech support of first two tiers won't be able to help you at all (they just read from the manual), unless you get someone at higher level, sometime your call get answer by foreign tech., it doesn't help either.Bottom line: If you know well about networking, it should be no problem to config this cam to your existing net work and enjoy the cam, Need to know how to config between your DSL modem (IP forwarding) and Dlink wireless router (or other wireless router), and open the port. In order to access this cam remotely, must have static ip address. I actually gave up to call tech help and learn to config this cam by myself."
1,Not ready yet,"This product may be the worse piece of technology I have ever gotten. It would routinely crash my networks (Tried it on 2 different ones). If used in wired mode, it can go from 1-3 days before bring down the network, if wireless 3-4 hours-I had to upgrade the firmware to make it this long on the wireless). Unit runs hot, and I doubt it will have a decent life expectancy anyways. Changing settings routinely lock up the system if doing so over the wireless connection. 802.11B is also lacking, but a telling indicator of Dlink's vision."
2,Watch your step.,"I don't know where everyone is getting these cameras, but I purchased one a week ago from Amazon. It was the DCS-5300W. Or so it was sold to me as. However, once received I discoved I was sent from Tiger Direct, the 5300 only. No wireless!. I call Tiger Direct and they tell me the 5300W won't be available until June 11th and they cannot take back orders. I check Amazon again - and the camera is still being sold - but now at a higher price. Where are these cameras? I wish these distribution companies would sell what they advertise and only when it is available. What a mess."
1,Buyer beware!,"Purchased from Aidanew&usedmerchandise. Dvd arrived in shrink-wrapped case with security seal. Looked great! Wish I could say the same about my viewing experience. The video was very grainy and centered within a wide black border; audio boomed excessively. Vendor offered to replace the DVD, but has not responded to my subsequent request for a refund instead. Inferior product; worse service. Save your money and watch a much cleaner transfer on YouTube..."
5,Cebtral Asia,"This is a well written and informative book. I believe Central Asia is one of the future areas of trouble in the world, and this is a good introduction at a reasonable price. I recommend it along with Tolstoy's Hadji Murad, translated by Aylmer Maude and Blanch's The Sabres of Paradise."
2,"Entertaining, but not as good as the work of Baruch Halpern","McKenzie offers a fun and popularized account of the life of David. However, the text he produces, far from being scholarly, often reads a bit like a tabloid account of King David. Deconstructing the book of Samuel, a Herculean and important task, has been accomplished elsewhere by serious scholars who offer very deep reconstructions of this most fascinating and contradictory character. Readers looking to explore the subject would do well to look for Professor B. Halpern's seminal work, ""David's Secret Demons."" While not as breezy in style, the book goes far deeper in uncovering its subject and will offer the reader far more food for thought. Therefore, if looking for an easy read, pick up McKenzie, but those with a serious interest in King David should put the time and effort into a more serious work. Please, take a look at Halpern; you won't regret it."
4,Functional and Pretty...,"The Seat Sock didn't wow me in person as much as the on-line photo did, but it is still a nice product. Made of nylon it fits over the toilet lid easily. I think they are a good way to decorate the bathroom if, like me, you don't care for the average ""furry"" toilet seat covers."
2,Publisher Stumbles,"What an appalling mistake Penguin Press made in scheduling these stoner boys on C-Span! The audience, bemused but uncomfortable, asked few questions.The story of two guys blundering into Iraq in the early days of the war and sponging their way about the country is not without interest. But the narrative is deliberately rendered in post-adolescent slacker talk. What was the publisher's purpose? Dumb and Dumber channeling Hope and Crosby on The Road to Iraq?They come off as a two-man wrecking machine. One incident: A poor shopkeeper demands they buy a newspaper they'd been thumbing through. They repeatedly refuse, enjoying the confrontation as if they were back in Southie. Can you say Ugly American occupiers?There will be many personal narratives coming out of this war. The one classic that captures the horror, the stupidity, and the humanity of it hasn't yet appeared. But Babylon by Bus, whose title was lifted from an old Bob Marley album, already is the low water mark."
3,About What You'd Expect,"What would you expect from a couple of directionless college dropouts that arrive in Baghdad with no plan, connections, writing skills, or other professional qualifications, and a history of unskilled seasonal work and living in less than habitable quarters - who then offer their observations based mostly on free-lance touring around? If you answered ""Not much,"" you pretty much have the picture of ""Babylon by Bus.""They did see (or hear about) cash U.S. money handed out to Iraqi groups willy-nilly (no baking system), Iraqi's taking advantage of U.S. naivete (eg. painting an existing building and then claiming reimbursement as though just built; misdirecting Americans against other Iraqis with whom they held a grudge), and U.S. generating resentment via storm-trooper tactics in neighborhood services, along with failure to improve living conditions.But you already knew all that already, so read something else."
4,Where is the movie??????,"This book just cries out to be made into a movie. It deals with exactly the topics that most war films avoid: the aftermath, the chaos confusion and madness of trying to recover a demolished society once the cowboy yahoos have dropped their load on it and flown off. I can only imagine this book must be stuck in some kind of hollywood development hell, I wish I had the money to put it on the screen."
2,learn how to write,"Great story, terrible writing. I only made it about a third of the way through because I couldn't take the amateurish writing any longer. The story is fascinating, and I was very excited to read this book after listening to an interview with the authors on NPR; it's just a shame that they couldn't find someone better to tell their story."
5,It's Not Easy Defining an Entire Genre...,"... but Von Doviak did it. Wow. This is the kind of pop culture read that I really like. Smart, funny, thoroughly knowledgeable. It was a fun and yet totally definitive exploration of a film genre that no one has really ever tackled. Maybe no one thought it was worth tackling? But Von Doviak braved the (swampy) waters beautifully. And being from Texas, I admit I was concerned that the book was going to rip apart my treasured Southern culture- but it didn't. This guy deserves a case of Lone Star."
2,"bland, not too believable","This is very cheaply made. Not very excitng and not very believable. Not enough compelling scenes with the name actors. One topless scene with a unknown 40ish actress (Jill Simon), is in very bad taste.She has the only nudity so if you are hoping to see Ali Larter nude you are out of luck."
2,Sidetracked,"After a good beginning, Confess drifts into a less interesting theme. After about an hour I was tempted to stop watching. I didn't buy Ali Larter's character at all. She's writing a thesis but she turns into an activist (accused of being a cyber-terrorist). Why? Her motivation for taking an active role instead of a research role was never clear to me. The story of Eugene Byrd's character is strong and the movie would have been better if the Ali Larter character hadn't sidetracked it. There was probably a point this movie was trying to make, a message it wanted to deliver, but I couldn't find it. The end of the movie is ridiculously unrealistic."
3,it was on sale...,"I thought the scarf was going to be more lilac and pinkish-purple like in the photo, but it was very 'purple' when I got it. The Colours looks different than displayed.The quality is excellent though. It's very lush and soft to the touch."
2,Book is often inaccurate and vague,"This book has some great hikes. You may use it to find the hikes, but do NOT rely on it's described hiking distances or directions. On one hike they describe a 1.5 mile section of trail that in reality was about 4 miles. Use your topo maps & GPS before the hikes to be sure of the distances. On another hike, their description of a return route was very vague & didn't mention several landmarks which would've made the route easier to find. Some of the slot hikes don't mention certain obstacles, though these could've happened after the book came out. This book may be too out of date to be useful..."
5,Get there and back with confidence,"Keep a copy in your car-- I do. Trail guides are easy to understand with all of the information needed to find trailheads with confidence. I have owned this book for years and have used it a number of times to plan trips to a specific destination or to break up long drives with a quick hike when I am on my way to/from some other activity. Get the book, fill the car with gas, and see how many of the hikes you can complete this year!"
2,Serious omission in an otherwise excellent book,"This otherwise excellent guide is seriously compromised by a major omission. For hiking in the west it is really important to know the maximum and minimum elevations of a trail. This book lists the elevation gain, but amazingly and foolishly does not tell you at what altitude the hike begins and ends. This is such a serious (and needless) blunder that I would not recommend the book."
5,for african ciclids,my ciclids have thrived on this formula for years. I buy the smaller containers because the product remains fresher longer.
5,Thank you all at a2zcds you have made a great contribution in keeping the spirit of America alive.,"""As a student of Political Science I am interested in the making of our great nation, pre and post the two great Wars, and these speeches have helped me tremendously in understanding our role in international affairs. Thank you all at a2zcds you have made a great contribution in keeping the spirit of America alive."""
3,Average,I was extremely pleased with the fast delivery!! 5 stars for that. Video quality was superb! Amar Gamal's belly dancing average but not as good as Sadie. Her instructions in the video was not detailed. Not for beginners.
5,cleansing brush for tubes,"works wonderfully! I love them a ton and they are a big help in getting those hard to reach spots that may get build up and mold, if using a different brush."
3,Does not fit Zo-li straw cup,"I purchased these hoping they would fit the Zoli straw cupZo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup. I just thought I'd post a review to let people know these Brown's straw cleaners are too big for the Zoli straw cup. They fit the upper straw, but not the narrower lower portion.They seem like sturdy straw cleaners otherwise."
4,You probably need extra cleaning brush,"You probably need extra cleaning brush, other than the one comes with the bottles, since it worn out very quickly"
2,"They're OK, but",You'd do just as well with pipe cleaners (you can get them in the craft department of lots of stores). They're a lot cheaper too.
5,LOVE it!,Great price and they keep all my straws clean! I also use them to clean the tips of nipples where the bottle brush doesn't always get to.
4,Necessary for nooks and crannies,"Bought these as backup for my Dr. Browns bottles. I love the bottles even though all of the little parts are quite cumbersome. The brushes a necessary to clean the valve pieces, and since each bottle pack only comes with one and it wears out after repeated use, the brushes are a must have."
4,Gets in there,This product has really been a lifesaver. A friend gave me some with a sippy cup (with a straw) and I used it so much that I needed to order another set. No other straw was quite as slender as this for cleaning my straws. Great tool---for a multitude of purposes. I even used it to clean out my teapot spout.
2,Very soft bristles,"The bristles are very soft and the handle bends like a cheap paper clip, which translates to me feeling like it's not really cleaning that well. Simply washing my straw with water immediately after a morning shake removes the fruit residue from my straw so I don't really get an added benefit with these."
3,Small Cleaning Brushes,The brushes are perfect for cleaning my husband's tracheostomy tubes. They are just the right size and I have been searching for a long time for something small enough yet gentle to thoroughly clean his tubes.
4,Great for bottles and most other things but clearly not for sippy cups.,"We have used these for Dr. Browns bottles and also several other things. Our daughter had a bottle every hour and a half until one year old, so after using these for that year I can say they last a good little while. For ""full time"" use , one will last 2-3 weeks. This 4 pack should last a little while.We tried these out with sippy cup straws but they didn't seem to clean as well with these and they weren't long enough for some. It's easier and quicker to be able from using just one end of the straw to get it all clean and with these you have to use both ends. As a parent you want something quick and durable and this didn't meet either of those needs. For bottles and other things they are great. There are products out there on the market specifically made for sippy cups and straws.I took one star off because they do bend easy."
5,Great for cleaning all sippy cups,Good value for these -- perfect for cleaning the straws and valves of all sippy cups! Wish they were in bright colors so they could be more easily found in the sink/drawer!
3,Useful Tools,"Useful ToolsThey come handy for washing and cleaning narrow items such as bottle straws, machinery and guns' parts. They are not heavy duty but they will do the job."
4,Get the job done,"These brushes are good multipurpose brushes and aren't good just for cleaning bottles. We use these to clean the small crevices of breast pump breastshield connector parts, sippy cups, straws for our Camelbak bottles, and more. We have been using these for over 6 months and they are still durable in the sense that they doesn't lose the bristles and clean the hard-to-reach places. They are pliable so if you're looking for something sturdy to make it easier to hold onto then these may not work for you. But for regular handwashing purposes and for folks that do a lot of handwashing bottles/straws and related parts, these do the trick and then some!"
2,Ended up returning,"I never used the product and ended up returning it. I purchased these because I needed something thin with bristles at the tip, but when I received them, there were barely any bristles at the top. I'm better off using a small toothbrush instead."
1,below one star,These brushes are so filmsy and small that they are good for alsolutely nothing. Maybe if you hamster needed a toothbrush and then you would have to buy one a week because they are so flimsy!!! AWFUL!!!
1,hair come off easily!,The brush hair come off easily from the stick. Imagine you left hair in the bottles and feed your baby. It's dangerous.
2,I thought there would be more,"I just thought from all the reviews I had read that this book would offer a little more insight into cycling position. The author just always comes back to the same conclusion which is ""just ride what feels comfortable"" not bad advice but I was hoping his discussion would focus more on performance gains. It is not a bad read if you are getting your first road bike and have no idea how to set it up but if you have been riding for some time you may find this book does not offer much information."
5,Excellent Book,"I was evaluated by Andy in the early 90s for IT Band Syndrome. There is no more knowledgable person on the practicalities of cycling biomechanics than Andy. This book contains a huge amount of information on bike fit, injury prevention, and injury treatment. I recommend this book for every cyclist of any caliber who has questions about fit or injury.My only complaint about the book is that Andy is a bit self-promoting in it; talking about how he fixed EddyM's bike fit issues, and how he fixed this or that world-class athlete's problem. Don't get me wrong; I have no doubt that he is telling the truth, but at some points, the comments seem a bit out of context."
5,Shagging for America,"Finally, an incredibly honest and funny book for ""real men"" about what concerns them most-Women. Sam Priest shamelessly guides us through the minefield of dating in America today, exposing what men realy want (in case you don't already know) and more importantly, how to get it. A new front has opened in the battle between the sexes. If you have a sense of humor you'll love this book. If you're a woman, you may not, but you'll still get plenty of ammunition to fight with."
2,Hating Across America,"Is Priest's homosexuality the cause or effect of mysoginy of this degree? He complains of shallowness (higher levels of prostitution) applied by his prey yet pens his manifesto with mention of Manhattan, and Southampton residences (trophies). In addition to his homosexuality (not that there is anything wrong with that)Priest lacks the intellectual prowess to capture this irony, or appreciation that as higher mamals we live beyond our glandular reactions (there is more to a heterosexual relationship or even encounter than putting something in a hole). Many personal nuances are so blatantly European as to cause the reader to question the originality of much of this material. Shameless whining reveals a skill set suitable for a career in personal injury law or insurance sales."
4,good product,"It took forever to get here but was happy when it did, I use it on my face and legs. Hurt the first couple of times but is much better now, Upper lip was the hardest. took 3 days to do it. Now just do a little every day or so, a little at a time is the only way I could do it. Chin was really easy and do it about every 2 week. Wouldnt be with out one again. Cover never fit right so I dont us it"
2,Not quite what I expected!,"For the price of this product, I really thought it was going to work better. It does not remove all hair and some it just doesn't get at all. Painful? yes, and left my skin with a hurting rash. It does remove most hairs, but doesn't deliver what it promises."
5,excellent!!!,"Overall, great service and product!!! what i like is i don't need to pluck my hair for the ages.. want to buy the cordless for my next order..."
1,Bad experience !,The product poses difficulty in using . Too much of skin stretching needs to be done for proper hair epilation. The same area has to be epilated over and over for a semi smooth finish. Eventually when you are done it is not as smooth as the finish of waxing. I decided to return it and landed up paying return shipping and restocking fee of 15 $ ! The pain is lot more than what I thought it would be. Overall a very bad experience.
2,The Epilady all over again,After reading the reviews it sounded worth a try but now I'm regretting it. I remember trying the Epilady when I was a teenager and how much it hurt but the reviews made this product sound so much better. I'm here to say it's NOT!! Pulling hairs out by the root is going to hurt no matter what. If you want to use it around the bikini area I recommend you think twice about that. The legs aren't as painful but it still feels like hairs being pulled out by the root which is exactly what it is doing. It's not very thorough either plus I was left with painful bumps that lasted a few days. I say stick to the razor or go get a wax. At least with a wax it's quick!
2,hair remover,it really didn't work as well as stated and I broke out bad with it and had severe leg swelling.
1,:((,"The epilator doesn't work at all, I have been trying to charge it for 35 hours but it's still not working"
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this product, and a few days later it wouldn't charge. I had to go out and purchase another one"
4,I plan to continue using,"Have used this twice now. Arms and legs. It stings at first, but it does seem to slow the growth of hair very well. I plan to continue using it. A steam shower first helps to soften the hair making removal easier."
5,Excellent Device,"This is the second Emjoi product I have purchased in two years, as my daughter ended up loving this method of hair removal, she took my corded/cordless one to college so I purchased the corded one for my self. If you are accustomed to waxing, then epilation is for you-saving you loads of money each year. This lighted version is heaven for those who may have less than perfect vision. The key is to make the skin tight and epilate after a shower or when pores are more open, to reduce any ""discomfort"" you may experience from the hair removal. Use Princereigns after epilation gel for preventing and eliminating ingrown hair for that just waxed feeling of smooth any time, without the mess or cost."
2,Only if it lasted,"I bought Emojoy AP-10L Light Caress in June, 2011. It's now November, 2011 and it already broke. Less than 5 months of use and it's dead! And no, I have not dropped it or done any sort of damage to it. Its motor just stopped working in the middle of my epilating session. My other Emjoy epilator lasted me three plus years before its cord broke, and thinking this Light Caress should last at least a year, I bought it. I'm sorely disappointed.As for the performance not counting suddent death, it works. It gets rid of unwanted hair, even the short ones. Wish this had lasted."
1,Do not buy if you value your privates,"I bought this about 8 months ago. Until a month ago, this was a pretty decent epilator considering the price and value. However, it has recently begun to malfunction on me. It will jam itself for no apparent reason. Which I am willing to understand. But I'm not able to be so understanding when I'm epilating my bikini area and the stupid thing jams mid-epilate, pinching extremely sensitive skin and drawing blood. The return window is long past but I'm hoping that Amazon will take pity and (NOT REPLACE) but refund me my money and allow me to purchase a different epilator. I'll be calling you tomorrow, Amazon. Here's hoping you take mercy on me."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I couldn't believe it, a 20 year-old science book that has somehow managed to stay relevant! I can usually read literature books hundreds of years old....but science... Very Insightful."
4,"An interesting book, but not a masterpiece","some reviewers say this book is a masterpiece,and the greatest book written by Freeman.Dyson, I really can't agree with them.I read the book twice, I find it is an interesting book. Dyson is undoubted a successful scientist, this book ,I think it as autobiography of Dyson. of course, it is very interesting and full of stories. But just like other autobiographies, it is just a story book, not a masterpiece. for these resons, I give it four stars.F.Dyson wrote some popular book, they are all excellent, but the greater work of Dyson is about scientific research, such as QED.I also like his ""infinite in all directions"", because it give me a special viewpoint about science, society and universe.anyway, The book,and others by dyson is worth of reading."
4,Good Job!!,I bought 3 of these hole saws.....they all have come in good shape and are still cutting fine after a month. We use these mainly on hardiplank. They are excellent for doing just that. Perfect for cutting in remodel boxes....Thanks
5,Una Super Produccion,"Yo jamas habia comprado un disco de Alejandra Guzman aunque siempre me habia llamado la atencion sus canciones y su forma de interpretarlas. Al salir los sencillos de este cd me di cuenta que valia la pena adquirirlo, escucharlo, y disfrutarlo porque es un disco que atrae por sus letras y las mezclas musicales, aparte que habia que entender el porque Juan Carlos Calderon estaba ahi, escribiendo baladas con toques roqueros.... La verdad este disco de la Guzman me encanta y espero que el que viene este igual o mejor..."
3,"Smart sci-fi but still a ""B""","Stephen Baldwin & Kyle MacLachlan star in this mind-transfering, clone-filled B flick which may be a bit too fictious to swallow. Stefan Toffler goes through a series of ""bodies"" before he is able to rescue back his own from terrorists all on a 48 hour time limit. Traces of a ""modern day D.O.A.""?"
2,lazy,"My expectations were low but not low enough. The characters are grownups as conceived by a 14-year-old, the science fiction elements are a jumble of naive, nonsensical, and derivative, the ending is telegraphed early on...Kyle MacLachlan is terrible; everybody else does surprisingly earnest work, thus 2 stars for what is otherwise a stack of hackwork. If anybody took an interest in the conception and writing of this, they must have been ousted early on."
1,horrible sci-fi thriller,"Stephen Baldwin(The Usual Suspects, One Tough Cop), Kim Coates(Battlefield Earth, WaterWorld) and Kyle Maclachlan(Hamlet2000, One Night Stand) in the same movie together is a good idea but this movie is horribly bad. Though some moments are as ok as others it explores into mind exchanging, hence the title XChange. Maclachlan is on the run and he goes to the nearest body flip, so he has the doc switch him to Stephen Baldwin and Baldwin has 50 hours till he decomposes and Kim Coates is the head badguy on the run trying to track him down. Bad acting with twists and nonstop moaning and groaning. The redhead who helps out Baldwin is hot though. If your a fan of any of the 3 I suggest you watch it and dont ever watch it again."
3,Okay for a while,This was great for a little while. My daughter loves putting all her toys in the little net but after a while the little balls started getting mold on the inside which was beyond disgusting and I eventually had to throw it away. I suppose it's not terrible for the price but just remember this is a temporary toy.
2,There Are Better Snowshoe Books Out There,"You can lump most of the newer snowshoe books together, and they are, ho hum, all about the same, that is not very good. They seem to be written by people that claim to be experts about everything to do with the outdoors, but I am not impressed with their knowledge of snowshoes or snowshoeing. ""Hey everybody, lets go out and spend $300 on little dinky plastic and aluminum snowshoes, because it is THE thing to do"", seems to be the battle cry of all these people. They always fill their books with lots of pictures of people climbing mountains, in attempt to impress us I guess. This is really impractical for a beginner, who is the real targeted audience for these books. The exception to this is the snowshoe book, ""The Essential Snowshoer"" recently written by Zwosta and even better the oldie ""The Snowshoe Book"" by Osgood and Hurley. These are better books, that explain the sport better, both past and present."
4,This is a great beginners snowshoeing book,This book takes you through the history of the snowshoe both past and current. Other sections concentrate on the different types of equipment needed for wintery travel and camping. If you know nothing about snowshoeing or winter camping make this your first book.
1,Cheaply made.,"Didn't even get a chance to really use it. Opened it from the package, was screwing the mic adapter on, and went to open the legs. Pulled the first one out, made sure it was snug, and SNAP! Leg broke right off. Somewhat glad because with that little force it would worry me to try using a mic with some weight to it.Can't recommend it, shame, seemed like it would be helpful, but get what you pay for I guess."
3,Does the job,"I bought this case knowing that I was being cheap. I have a scoped 30-06 and a scoped 22. I want to be able to bring them both to the range in the most compact way possible. This did the trick just fine. Foam inside is very adequate at holding the rifles securely in place. The case is made from the minimal plastic necessary to get the job done. I don't think it will break or fall apart. As mentioned by other reviewers, when closing the case it is necessary to align the halves properly as the case flexes a good bit until closed. The latches that pop off rather than breaking when twisted or torqued the wrong way was a nice touch, too. Really not bad for $29.99."
5,Perfect,Needed to replace a case that previously broke. This case was the exact model and was cheaper through Amazon. It was exactly what I wanted.
4,Its a gun case that holds guns,I found this case perfectly fine for carrying guns in my car to and from the range. It holds a shotgun an ar-15 with a red dot sight and can hold a pistol all in one case. so for the price i paid i feel pretty happy with it overal.
5,excellent!,"First off, Thank you for such quick shipping during the holiday season!I had this exact case years ago, and it recently broke after falling down a flight of stairs. Bottom line: spacious, and well constructed.If you're contemplating this gun storage option, for the price it cannot be beat!"
5,No Complaints,Purchased this case to hold my 30-30 and 12g shotgun. Both have scopes and slings and fit perfectly in the case. I recently moved and had this case at the bottom with boxes and misc. things packed on top and it held up fine. The lock clips have a tendency to come off if your rushing to close the case up quick but I'd rather have them come off then break. I highly recomend this well made inexpensive case to any gun owner.
4,Good Protection - Recommended,"This Plano ""Double Gun Case"" easily fits two rifles and provides decent protection to and from the range. We picked two of these up at a local sporting goods specialty store for my son and I to use at shooting event (Appleseed) that allows the use of two rifles (we each fit a Ruger 10/22 and an AR-15 in these cases).The case is all plastic with reasonably thick foam padding and has a molded in handle. I like that it has four snap closures to ensure it stays closed in transport and it does have three holes for locks (not included), but locked or not this would not take long to get into with simple hand tools.It is fairly lightweight so would not want to subject it to a lot of abuse and it certainly shouldn't be used for checking as baggage on an airline, but it is great for transporting multiple rifles to the range.Recommended, with the above caveats.CFH"
2,Do you put rifles in this thing?!,"Where are all these glowing reviews coming from for this case? Low expectations maybe?I have 2 rifles that needed to go into this case to bring to the range:* a 14.5"" (16"" OAL) mid-length AR15 without a scope with fold-down front and rear sights* a Ruger 10/22 without a scope with Tech SightsAfter fumbling around for 5 minutes with the el cheapo padding falling out, I finally got it to fit (ever played Tangrams as a kid?) at which point the case wouldn't close without me practically sitting on it. The el cheapo latches wouldn't latch without me forcing the case shut at the same time as holding the plastic together.After all that one of the latches literally flew off!I wound up removing the top layer of egg crate foam and replacing it with some bubble wrap I had laying around. I wasn't looking for a Pelican here for 36 bucks, but come on!2 stars because, well, it'll work great for transporting handguns!"
4,Good value,"This case is well built and holds one scoped rifle with ease. I am happy with the purchase, and it arrived in perfect condition."
3,Does the trick.,"This thing is alright. It locks in 3 different places which is nice but the plastic is a little flimsy. You can really get anything better for the price though. The latches detach on their own sometimes when the case is open but are easily put back on. I store my tactical Remington 870 and Ruger 10/22 in here no problem. To and from the range is good. But idk how much abuse it can really stand up to seeing how I treat my things pretty nice. Id say get it, as long as you understand and are willing to have a carry case, not a combat storage unit."
4,Gun carry case,"Ordered two of these units from Amazon and the supplier took 3 days to process and finally ship from the factory in Plano IL. These are more flexible than expected as I thought they would be rigid since they are molded plastic, even after closed and latched. Interior foam is loose , a quick application of spray foam glue cured that problem. Latches pop off rather easily but also go back on easily. For taking rifles to the range and locally they are a good buy but I would not use them to ship a gun by air or any other means. Excellent dust covers for your guns. One rifle with scope and one without fit fine, might be a bit tangled with two scoped units though."
5,Fits 2 rifles nicely,I purchased for a gift and he was pleased with the construction and size. It fit both of his rifles nicely and secure. A good value.Thanks
1,Doesn't hold two rifles,Tried to put a pair of AR-15s in it... was only able to close it with severe bulging and misalignment.
3,you get what you you pay for,"solid, affordable, entry level case. only issue is how often the closures simply fall off the case. beats a soft case for storage"
3,GOOD FOR THE MONEY,GOOD FOR STORAGE OR TRANSPORT TO THE RANGE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FLIGHTS BECAUSE PLASTIC NOT HARD ENOUGH FOR THAT TYPE OF TRANSPORT
5,Great Item for the Range,"Great case to carry multiple long guns to the range, I would NOT check this case on an airline, however I did not buy the case with that in mind.. Great deal and I highly recommend it for range use. Also cant beat the price }:)"
4,Perfect Case for the Price!,The Plano Double Gun Case is great for the money. It holds two guns with lots of extra room. It has about an inch of padding inside the case. It isn't the high quality of case but it does its job.ConclusionThis case is great for the price. Not the greatest quality but it does its job. Protect the gun.
4,Great price,Living in the inner-city this case makes a great choice. I'm able to transport my guns to the range with out attracting attention.Quality is very suprising for the price. If you are looking to transport guns and don't want to spend a lot of money look no further.
4,"Good, cheap quality case, good gun safe alternative.","This is a very good case for the money. It's much cheaper than the others, but they did not skimp on build quality by any means. It's solid plastic, and nothing feels flimsy. I bought this as an alternative to a giant safe I have neither the money nor the space for, and I am very satisfied with my purchase. It fits my 10/22 and a few knives just fine. It will likely fit my Remington 870 as well, when I get it back.There are 3 spots for padlocks on this case, two on the sides, one in the middle. Make sure you buy at least two padlocks, because one in the middle is not sufficient, you could pop open the case, and pull a gun out from the sides. It would be painful, but it is very possible. With all three padlocks, it is solid, and it would take a lot of work, or a bolt cutter, to get this open without the key/combination.Bottom line, quality case, works very well as an alternative to a safe, buy 3 padlocks."
4,Great for the price.,Good deal all around. Only thing I'd like to see improved is metal in the padlock holes. The soft plastic would be easy to cut.
4,Good Gun Case,Case will work for what it is intended for. Seems to be very sturdy with good padding inside. Very good inexpensive lockable case.
3,Not great for bolt action rifles,"I have a bolt action airsoft rifle, and this thing is perfect length for it, but the cocking bolt protrudes and makes this case pretty difficult to get close, and often the latches pop off. (Which is better than them breaking) But the case feels very flimsy when open. It's fine for my air soft gun, but I don't I would feel comfortable putting a real fire arm in this thing. And I really can't imagine getting two rifles in this thing with scopes on them. It'd either be real tight, and I'd worry about damaging the scopes, or they just plain wouldn't fit. So if you're looking for something cheap to just get the basic job done, this will work, but if you're looking for a quality case you'll have for a long time, look elsewhere."
3,Good and Affordable case for light duty use.,"Overall this Plano case is decent, especially when considering price. I was disappointed, however, when I tried putting my Mossberg 590A1 20"" Barrell Shotgun in with its Side Saddle attached. The case is not ""deep"" enough really for a shotgun equipped with a Side Saddle.Other than that I imagine any AR15 will fit great and any other rifle or shotgun that doesn't have accessories that come off the side too far. The Egg Crate foam also does a pretty good job of not allowing things to move around too much.Hope this helps, and be safe!"
5,excellant produect,Hard plastic case with good foam liner and three good openings for padlocks all at a very reasonable price. It handles a 12 guage and a scoped 30-30 comfortably. What's not to like.
4,Plano Gun Case,"Very nice case for the money. Holds my Mossberg 500 and Savage 22lr with scope.Could be a little deeper had to press pretty hard to close. Don't think I wouldship in it or use for airlines, but certainly good for transport to and from the range."
4,airsoft use,"currently using this for airsoft. i could barely fit two M4's in the case. for the price, i could not complain as it does hold both rifles snug and the lock is firm. i wouldn't try to put heavy things over the case though."
3,Not Bad for the MoneyI,I NEEDED AN INEXPENSIVE HARD COVER CASE FOR A COLLECTIBLE RIFLE THAT DOESN'T SEE A LOT OF USE. THIS CASE IS MORE THAN ADEQUATE FOR THE JOB. IF I WERE GOING TO THE RANGE ONCE A WEEK I SUSPECT THE LATCHES AND HINGE WOULD BECOME PROBLEMATIC AT SOME POINT.
4,Rifle case,"i got this rifle case to store/transport my wassr-10 rifle....for this type of rifle it's pretty big , but i has planty of space and 3-locking slots...well made and good padding inside"
4,Gun Case from Plano,"Case worked out very well, I will use Plano products again.Plano products have my needs for over 50years ,an outstanding line."
4,good product,"Came faster then expected, good quality, and seems durable. good price for what i need. Clasps seem little cheap but for a seasonal user it does the job ok"
3,"It's OK, but not really heavy duty","The adage of ""you get what you pay for"" applies here. It's an ""OK"" gun case but the plastic is not really that sturdy as it does flex somewhat. As others noted, the foam lining inside falls out of the top cover when you open it so you probably want to glue it down with some kind of adhesive, or keep pushing it back in each time you get ready to close it up. Also, the plastic latches easily falls off if you're not careful when you unlatch it. It does handle my S&W M&P15 easily even with my stock fully extended."
5,Great Case,"This case is great, I own two and will likely be ordering a third shortly.Things I've crammed in them: a Saiga 12 and a WASR10; an AR-15 and HK 416; an AR-15 and another AR-15; a scoped Remington Model 700 and an M1 Garand.Very solid cases, and will hold quite a bit."
5,Awesome,"Fits a gsg 522 with three mags and ammo, also fits a m4 with 2x mags, attached scope, 2 laser bore sighter and a complete cleaning kit. Quality product"
2,Cheap but you get what you pay for,"Clasps are ok but the two sides meet somewhat unevenly. Fine for under-the-bed storage but lacks the ruggedness that might be necessary for travel. Overall, pretty cheaply made but, again, for the price that might not be a huge concern."
4,Quality Rifle Case,"I am really happy with this case; however, I think it would be a little to tight for 2 long guns. It fits my Ruger .270 with scope and Bi-pod. As for quality, the case has 3 places to secure the top and bottom, 4 clasps; the outside is strong plastic, and the interior egg cartoon is very nice."
3,Light and Weak,"I was hoping to save space and actually put two rifles in this case but after trying it I was disappointed! It is just not strong enough to hold the weight. It started to Flex and pop a hinge. It does work well for a scoped rifle by it self as long as it's a relative light rifle. I have my 22 cal with scope in it now and it works great for that. So if you need a two rifle case, keep looking!I do recommend this case for two rifles!Plano Double Scoped Rifle Case w/Wheels"
3,Flimsy,If you don't have all three locks on it you can pull up on the plastic and slip a gun out if you want
4,"Great Value, but Huge!","This case is a very good value. It is a lot of case for the money and it does a good job of holding my rifles. I hadn't considered its length before buying, so I was a bit surprised to find it is too long to fit in my car's trunk and barely fits across the back seat."
4,great case for the price,"It's a great case and fits my AR-15, 870, and Glock 22 all at the same time. It has three lock holes but I wouldn't bet on the case holding up against someone who really wanted inside. For the price, this thing can't be beat. I will probably buy the same one again when this one breaks down."
2,This book is a bit outdated,I want to get into the independent recruiting business so I thought this book would be a good start. The book is ok. But I was disappointed to find out it was published in 1994! That's like 150 years in technology years. Mackie's list of expenses includes $300 for a TYPEWRITER! There is no info on online recruiting and it's mostly the authors war stories of his recruiting experiences 20 years ago.
1,Outdated,"Sadly, this book is not useful in today's market. It spends a lot of time on procedures that no longer apply to the employment field. Nice try, but no cigar."
5,One of the very finest introductions to recruiting.,"""Take This Job and Sell It"" is intended for the individual with little or no experience in executive recruitment. As such, this exceptionally written guide provides a concise overview of executive level recruitment and in my opinion should be the first choice of anyone wanting to get into this exciting and financially rewarding career field. Bradley David Heden, rosetta2"
3,Not Helpful for Internal Recruitment,"It had basic information for internal recruitment and more extensive information for recruiting independently or with an agency. Overall, not that helpful."
1,Doesn't even fit properly,I am so disappointed with this product. It doesn't fit over my baby's car seat so I haven't used it at all. I just pull down the car seat's canopy when I need to shade my baby from the sun. What a waste of money.
3,Starts strong and drops like a rock,"I bought this after seeing this guys show and wondering who the heck he is and why he has a show on TV other than cable has openings. I find his show okay sometimes ... that is his book. Started strong I was real interested and about a third of the way through it was borrrring. Maybe its just me but it is advice thats, well, it started strong I'll say that ..."
1,Ego Deustch....,"This is one of the most boring, predictable and narcissist book I have ever read. What portrays to be a business book is nothing more than an non-objective autobiography of Donny whose anecdotes are not even interesting."
1,Useless book for intermediate users.............,This book caused me a great deal of stress when scripts wouldn't work and the information was hard to understand. The mysql part of the book was no help at all. I have purchased a couple of other books which have been a whole lot better and user friendly......I really wish I hadn't wasted my money......
2,Poor introduction to PHP and general programming,"I already know Perl and C++. Learning PHP was very easy for me using this book. That being said, I don't think I would have had such an easy experience without my previous knowledge.Butzon leaves out several important concepts such as file IO and advanced searching with regular expressions. He talks nothing of modules and libraries. He seemed to write the boook with the intention of getting readers hooked on MySQL for all their database needs.PHP By Example is fine for experienced programmers to learn the basics of PHP, but I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone else."
3,Non Fiction,"PHP by Example is an example of a fairly ordinary programming book. I really didn't care for this one much at all and pretty much have never finished it, looking at other resources instead when necessary. I definitely don't recommend getting this one, unless it is in a bargain bin or somewhere like that."
5,Best ever on PHP,"I tried several books, including the welling thompson one.This book is the best, straight to the point and easy to understand. Highly recommended for anyone new to php and keen to learn fast."
4,Great as a trap case,"I purchased the case for use as a trap case - microphone stands, cymbal stands, etc - rather than as a gold bag case. It works very well in that capacity. It has more space than other types of hardware cases marketed to drummers. Now I own two of them."
2,Didn't hold up for the first airline trip :-(,"We purchased this product to take 2 abbreviated sets of clubs (in very light travel bags) on vacation. We had to pay oversize charges; that was OK, though, we expected that. When we picked up the case at the baggage claim area, finding that one side of the handle (on the top of the case) had snapped on its first trip was not OK. The snapped handle prevented us being able to use the wheels, and every other time we had to transport this case on the vacation was not pleasant.This case would be fine if you were the only one to handle it, but if you are taking it through the airline system, beware. We are returning the case."
4,mist and stone,a must have for all charmed fans it takes you further into paiges life before she was charmed with one of the main characters being connected to paiges social worker job than her charmed one (both do end up mixing of course)the plot i wont reveal but it's different to anything before with a few twist and turns in there to overall a good read even if your not a charmed fan
3,"very similar in writing style and ending to ""Spirit of the wolf""","What I meant is, (in my opinion, that is) that both books are similar in the fact that the real action only occurs at the last few pages of the book, the rest being planning, ideas, solutions and other minor incidences. Personally, I found the whole ""Mist and stone"" effect confusing and hard to wrap my mind around it. But the plot was intriguing enough, just the ending was a tad disappointment. But an average read, overall."
1,Great in theory,"These shoes are great in theory, but are NOT wearable. First, the shipping came within the time frame it said, but unlike other purchasers, it did not come early. I had hoped it'd get here in time for an event and it did not. I got them after a return from a trip and so did not have time to send them back for the full refund. Second, the material looks a bit cheaper than I had hoped. Some of the seems were fraying a bit. Last, the shoes looked okay on, but it was impossible to walk. If I could wear them just standing up or just sitting down, it would be fine. I never could wear them long enough to go out of my house, b/c I was falling all over the place. This purchase reminded me of why I should never buy shoes online."
3,Classic,"I bought this disc because I heard the last movement of the Symphony in G major on Pandora. The music is very pleasant, and could be described as classic classical. But nothing out of the ordinary. Good background music."
4,Stolid and thorough,"While a tad dry, it does the job of telling the artist's life, showing the great art, and giving a fair bit of decent travelog. Bonus points: Not too much talking head stuff or corny historic reenacting. Excellent to prep for a trip to Italy."
2,"Too much life, not enough art",The DVD did not meet my expectations; I thought the emphasis would be on theimportance of the artist's innovations and on the analysis of his works rather than on details of his life.
5,The best hands-on wordquest yet!,This book contains thousands of unfamiliar words. Moving through the games gives a sense of discovery. The Dusty Words are paired with more common words to get an idea of what the words mean. It's as timeless as is the english language and is perfect for people of all ages. It makes a great gift!
1,Romantic Mischief,"This book is filled with tips on romance, which would, in fact, be helpful if any of Godek's previous partners had been over the age of six. He knows less about romance than a roofied Coke, and his idea of 'mischief' is letting his wife cook something other than a sandwich. A cageful of apes would make more sense if they took turns ramming their genitals into a keyboard.""Of Note #4: Attach a note to your partner's calculator: ""You can count on me.""Jesus Christ. Every time Godek tries to make a pun, a dozen females go sterile. It's that unfunny. If you read one aloud, your balls will actually detach in an effort to distance themselves from your mouth. Your girlfriend is funnier when she screams your dad's name during sex.Godek has the same effect on your relationship as flammable lubricant. If you've ever been caught looking down a girl's shirt, you have more experience with women than him."
2,Sweet,"I found this CD hugely disappointing. Kanda Bongoman did not do his fans any justice with this CD. Unlike the fast-tempo beats found in Zing Zong, Kwassa Kwassa, Live In Central Park et cetera in which he actually does the singing, he does nominal singing in this Sweet CD. The beat itself verges on the ordinary and if I had known it would be this bad, I would not have bought it."
2,Poor recording,"The recording is terrible. The problem is simple. The microphones are centered on the chorus and they are too close. Listening to it is jarring. You will have 10 minute quiet passages where the orchestra is playing, when suddenly the chorus comes in and it is thunderous. One of the worst mixing jobs I have ever heard. I find it simply unlistenable."
5,some shimmers here...,"Not David Gray so much, he's too ""we're grown up now""...think the first time you walked into your junior high dance. It's 1986, there are streamers and somehow dimmed lights where the basketball backboards usually were. All those things you thought romance was going to be, wrapped up in a series of dramatic gestures which would instantly tell your beloved everything she needed to know (or he, or course) all to a backbeat of ""Take My Breath Away"" or ""Just Like Heaven"", it's like he still remembers those dramatic gestures we were all going to make, and he's got enough voice where he doesn't have to giggle about them.The man can sing. And there's some non-derivitive top 40 sensibilities mixed in with a little bit of worldly-knowledge. What else could you ask for?It beats Coldplay. Think Future Bible Heroes, with a little bit more on his sleeve."
5,So worth the listen and experience,"It is a crying shame that artists like Bill Budd don't get air play. The music, lyrics and voice are emotional and powerful. His lyrics are inspired and he in turn does the same for the listener. I feel haunted each time I listen to ""And So Here."" It just takes talent to be able to take the listener to a higher plain. Sorry it that sounds hokey but it is true. Made my spirit move! Incredible! I became a fan instantly!"
2,"""This is one of the worst books I have read by KM""",All I have to say is this was very boring and drawn out. Too many plots in one story. The love secnes were great. But the story was hard to get through.
3,NEEDED MORE,"The story and the characters seemed shallow to me. If depth had been added to both, then it would have been most likely a five star review. It still was an enjoyable read; just a tad on the generic side. For instance, instead of throwing in the character's of the lady's' maid and her troubled beau, if Mrs. Martin had taken the care that she had given these two characters and delved it into the two main characters-well, then the book most likely would have been top-notch."
1,Just Plain Awful...,"This story was gloomy and there was too much unhappiness going on. I didn't find anything very uplifting about the tale.The tactic Rafe used to get Dani to sail back to England with him was appalling. He was completely unlikable and unappealing.And Dani had a valid point - if Rafe had really loved her, he would have taken her side - at least or until the facts of the incident became clear, the jerk.In fact, I don't believe he was all that in love with her to begin with, especially after he inferred that since it had been 5 years, he wasn't sure he even knew her anymore. Five years would have been nothing to a man in love."
2,"Promising storyline, but didnt deliver","I had read the first two books in this series, and was eager to read this one. When I discovered the storyline, I figured that this would be a good book. But once I started reading this book, I became more and more confused and disgusted. Everything happened too quickly and without much substance, not enough emotion or thought. I did not even finish the book, but put it down and made to sell it online. The other two books in the series are good, and worth reading. This one was just a disappointment."
3,A good read,"All of the books from the necklace trilogy were good. This final book is definitely worth reading, though not the best."
2,Repetitive,"I understand that trilogies are meant to tell either 1) the continuation of a character's story or 2) tales of people who inhabit the same world BUT that doesn't mean that it has to be the same story three times.1) The man in someway ruins or compromises the woman2) The man reluctantly ends up with but comes to love the woman3) The woman always has green eyes4) And of course the necklace.Ugh, the first was okay, the second so cliche and the third redundant. I've been on a bit of a regency romance kick, though normally I prefer urban fantasy like Ilona Andrews or Kim Harrison, and have found some sweet stories.If lite romance is what your after, and you want something in Jane Austen's vein I suggest Lord Carew's Bride (and it's companion novel, Dark Angel--maybe not it that order) by Mary Balogh."
2,Weak and unbelievable,"This trilogy ended with a whimper, especially with the miraculous conception at the end--v. hard to believe, esp. when the author went to the trouble of having a doctor reiterate how ""damaged"" the heroine was from her previous accident. Without that, the reader might have believed it, 19th c. medicine being what it was(nt'), but with it... And the heroine did a pretty good job of seeming reluctant to marry the duke, when all she had to do was tell him that big secret. ""He owes me his name"" is flimsy justification."
2,Two Incredibly Selfish People find Lust in Regency Period,"I loved the first two books in this series, so I pre-ordered this one to be sure I had it right away. I don't remember ever being so dissapointed. I had to put this book down in the middle as my gag quotient was met time and time again. Probably one of the worst heroines of all time. True Regency heroines slip away into the night or day when they feel their beloved would be better off without them. Rafe's mother wasn't nasty enough to bring her into the Goodbye for your own Good speech.I pretty sure that even in modern times if you had crippled a man for life and then someone is trying to kill you, you may conclude that he may be involved! One last complaint, what dumb woman wouldn't think that a Duke might just need an heir?"
1,Very Disappointing!,"I'm in the middle of the book & can't even finish the book - a rarity for me. The heroine is pathetic. A real jellyfish. Even for that time period, she could have had some backbone at least. And the hero - well, the heroine should have smacked him upside the head, rather than let him boss her around all over the place! I didn't think he was a likable character at all. I found him to be immature, mean & conniving. All in all, a total waste of my money."
3,Santa's Greatest Hits,"Some I like, some I don't, but it's still a nice album for background holiday music. I like more upbeat music."
5,Disavowed,"This murder mystery keeps the reader guessing till the end. After finishing the book, I wanted to know what happens to the characters next."
3,weak strap supports,the knee pads seem to be of good quality other than the straps do not look like they are made of a high grade of leather. I do not think that they will last as long as the knee protection pad will.

1,wtf?,"NOT JUST THIS BUT NONE OF THE WWE DVDS ARE ON STOCK UNLESS U PAY THE WHOLE PRICE, WHAT THE **** IS UP WITH THAT? I SPENT 3 HOOURS PICKING OUT GOOD DVDS, AND NONE OF THEM ARE IN STOCK!"
3,"A Hot Main Event, but Vince Russo is booking...","WWF Rebellion is a U.K.show from October 1999, and it was one of the last shows of the Vince Russo era. This show is a solid one, and it held many of the trademarks of Russo booking. This means T&A, and short matches, with screwjob endings all over the place. Russo cares more about story than wrestling and it shows. In the undercard none of the matches are actively bad, but neither are they good. They all are average matches, hovering around **. (in this system, * is bad, ***** is a classic match)Also, the goal of the evening is to make the Bulldog a major heel in the WWF, so look for him to be involved all night. But the main event is Triple H vrs The Rock in a Cage, and they do a great job. But we've seen these two wrestle a million times, and because of that I wouldnt recommend Rebellion, unless you are really interested in seeing them in a steel cage. Overall, thumbs in the middle."

5,Nice Drill!,"Excellent compact, lightweight drill for everyday projects when you don't need the 18V hammer drill. Great power and battery life despite its small size."
2,there must be better for the money,"i have had this drill for about a year. i have used drills now for over 50 years, so am familiar with the good and bad. the drill i got really lacks power; lacks the power to insert 4"" deckscrews in redwood, 2"" screws in hardwood is a no-can-do, forget drilling steel and applying pressure, the drill stalls out...the clutch regardless of the highest setting lets the drill stall. i have owned far cheaper drills which had enough torque to twist your wrist, no danger with this one. ..i bght it due to the 50 buck sale price...but would have been better off with another brand...about all i can saw good is it looks nice and is portable...even at 35bucks it would be iffy as a 'light-use' tool."
2,Returned because of a defect,"The delivery, packaging and billing went very well. Unfortunately the keyless chuck was locked in the wide open position so that I couldn't close it to use a drill bit or screw driver."
3,Cheap stuff inside,"A nice drill for light work. However the batteries made in China, as those cheap drills, died within few months after intensive usage."
1,Clutch slips on high RPM setting,"I own 2 of the original 12v drills manufactured by Panasonic, the full size model and the Predator. I purchased 4 of these drills hoping the batteries would fit in the older drills. Fortunately they do, otherwise they would be going back.This drill has a serious flaw. On the high RPM setting the clutch slips. Reminds me of the slipping transmission in an old Buick I had. It was fine until I accelerated then it slipped and jerked when it ""caught"". This drill will not allow you ""feather"" screws in, on the high RPM setting. Since I have 4 of the drills and all of them do the same thing, I didn't get a fluke.In my estimation the lack of a usable high RPM setting makes this drill a loser."
1,Not meant for the microwave,"These pads simply don't work in the microwave as advertised. The beads melt a hole in the material and then you have a mess with these mini-beads going all over your kitchen counter, floor, etc."
2,Cute but lasted only a year,"This dryer is easy to hold & worked well for just over a year, then quit. I've never had a blow dryer that broke after only 15 months."
5,sleep CD,"I was given a copy of this by a hotel that I stayed at often and I loved it! When I lost the CD I came here and bought the download. I have NEVER had a CD like this. I NEVER get to hear the last part because I have always fallen asleep before hand! Now THAT'S awesome! Good sleep, no drugs.. And I wake up more refreshed that when I don't listen to it. WELL worth the money. It WORK!"
4,Ever dreamed of chucking it all?,"Who has never fleetingly dreamed of just ""chucking it all"" and taking off on a nomadic trip around the world?Richard Meredith, finding himself at a mid-life crossroads, did just that, and shares insightful, often humorous, vignettes of his yearlong adventure in ""One Way or Another"".His book is a witty, entertaining hodgepodge of observations, personal anecdotes, historial background and information.It will surely leave some readers, with their own wanderlust aroused, wondering: Could I? Should I? And if not now, when?- Joan Riley, Absolute Write.com"
2,not great for frequent use,"We've had this iron for a four years now, and the teflon coating is now not only chipping away, but the waffles always stick to the plates. The uneven heating has gotten exponentially worse over the last few months and overflows are a real pain to clean with this item. I really wish they made one with removeable plates. In fairness, this iron was being used at least weekly for a long while, but I still feel that for an item of this price range, it's not perofming up to par. I'm throwing it out and getting another brand."
3,I guess that's what they are supposed to look like?,"This waffle iron does not cook hot enough for me. My waffles are underdone at the first ""done"" beep. I let them sit until the second beep, and they are at least edible. It also takes a LOT of batter to completely fill the huge, gaping chasms of the ""belgian"" style grooves."
3,"Good waffle iron, they last about 3 months in our use.","We have a breakfast restaurant, hours 6:30 to 2:00 PM. They last approximately 3 months with this kind of use. I am waiting for a waffle iron designed as a belgium style but with detachable grids which can be cleaned away from the electronics. I think the daily cleaning is what make them last such a short time. However this is the best iron we have found so far."
4,Nice Waffler,This waffler was a gift for my son. He loves Belgian waffles and says this waffler is great.
3,Could be better,"I purchased this waffle maker based on reviews and so far have only been completely satified with how the waffles turned out about 50% of the time. The back ""burners"" do not cook the waffle through as well as the front one when I use a thick batter and that part comes out doughy no matter how high I set the heat. A thin batter works better but I can still tell the differnce in the back portion of the waffle. I am disappointed with it and will probably purchase a different one at a later point. Next time I will not throw away the box until I've made sure it does what it's supposed to! If that wasn't the case I would rate it a 5 because it is easy to use, doesn't stick as long as it's been sprayed w/cooking spray prior to use, it is fast and the tones tell you when it is ready to use and when it is done. Perhaps mine is defective."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"Because of the rave reviews (there were also negative reviews) on Amazon, I thought I would try the VillaWare V3200 Classic Belgian Waffler. The first one I received had a broken part. The replacement I received (Amazon very quickly sent me a replacement) didn't make whole, usable waffles. No matter which recipe I tried, the waffle stuck to the waffle iron and I had to dig it out. It was a big disappointment."
5,VillaWare v3200 classic belgian waffler,"This is the second v3200 VillaWare Belgian Waffler that I have ordered. The second was a gift to my mom. She loved mine so much that I gave her one for Christmas. The waffle comes out perfect, not guessing at the cooking time. The waffler beeps when it is hot and ready to cook. I love mine and would order another one just like it if quit today."
5,Family should stick together,"I started reading the book and it's getting really good. And my advice to all of James Johnson (Lil Jimmy) family members is to read it and to support the ""Family Bond"". :-)"
2,A perfect plan,"When we speak it we live it, as people let's stop glorifying street and gangster life. Unleash the perfect plan in your then put it into effect."
5,Perfect Story - 1 Disappointment,"I loved The Perfect Plan. The action and drama never ceased and the characters were so real I could see them walking the block. My favorite was Crime. To be in that catz mind and see the plan and hear the wisdom was like WHOA. I was feeling Sharon until she flipped and got on some vendeta sh$t. She should of died in the end, but the fact that she didn't just has me feenin for part 2. Come wit it man! I know its gonna blow me away."
5,The Best Holiday Present: Highest Recommendations,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. It's beautiful. We're not sure of the age child we will get so this book was a perfect fit. I love all the places for photographs. It's a beautiful book. Designed for any child, any age, any adopting situation. Very thoughtful and sweet. God Bless!"
5,Wonderful Book!,I bought this book as a gift for a friend of mine who is adopting. She loves it and is so appreciative of the layout that helps her easily document this wonderful time of her life. I thought it was a great gift because it's so easy for the parents to introduce themselves to the baby since most of it is a fill-in-the-blank autobiography. This makes the perfect gift for a most special occasion.
5,Great Gift for Anyone Adopting!,"I was searching for a gift for a friend of mine who is adopting as a single mom and is getting a 3 year old. I was so frustrated I was ready to scream. Then I heard about this book and ordered it immediately. It is WONDERFUL and the friend I gave it to LOVES it. I love the cover. I love the pages. I love the sections for writing. (Use a ball point pen though so your writing doesn't smear.) If you are adopting or know someone who is, this is a great gift for moms, dads, single parents, older child, adopting abroad...you name it, this book will work. What a keepsake. Thanks!"
1,Cheap Imitation of a better book!,"This book is a cheap imitation of a MUCH better book written by Rebecca Gold and photography by Pamela Sardinha. It's called ""Till There Was You-an adoption expectancy journal."" It's a wonderful book with insights from ALL family members and includes space to write your own thoughts and feelings throughout the book (not only at the end like this book). it also includes thoughts and heartfelt feelings from other adotive parents, friends in the adoption community AND leading phychologits on the subject. If you're even thinking about buying this book, you owe it to yourself to check out ""Till There Was You"" first. You won't regret it. I have to admit that can't say the same about this book."
4,Informative Book,"I found this book to be very usefull to me and very informative. It's detail and ease of understanding is highly rated. I am impressed by the author's unique ways of explaining the subjects, something I always found myself unable to do. I definately recommend this book to anybody in this proffesion and think it's an essential addition to ones library."
2,It's made in Korea,"WMF is the German brand but this flatware is made in Korea, I am very disappointed."
1,it's made in Korea,I gave it 1 star because it's made in Korea. WMF is from Germany so I expected this flatware to be made in German. I can't tell if the quality is different but for those who want to have the German made WMF flatware -- this is for your information.
3,Suzie helped because now I know its not from China,"Havent really tried it, but one of the reviewers was negative because it was made in Korea. I've been looking for new flatware that *isn't* made in China after the dog food and lead paint in toys incidents. While I'd slam dunk anything made in the USA, no flatware (except for some expensive silver stuff) is anymore. Sad, but true."
5,Enthralling Spatial Episodes & A Romantic Song Cycle,"An amazing album. To sum up ""Music of the Spheres,"" I will quote the notes that come with the CD: ""Langgaard's work focuses on space, height and depth, light and shadow, foreground and background. It does not constitute musical process, but a succession of spatial episodes most often of a repetitive static nature. Or, as the composer himself expresses it, 'In Music of the Spheres I have completely given up everything one understands by themes, consistency, form and continuity. It is music veiled in black and impenetrable mists of death.'"" Although a work foreshadowing modernism, it has religious aspirations and is mostly meditative but sometimes enthralling. The other piece, Four Tone Pictures, is a more conventional and lush Romantic song cyclic."
1,unhappy,SOME OF THE PANYHOSE HAD RUNS IN THEM THAT MEANS THEY WERE DAMAGE BEFORE THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE PACKAGES.IT COSTS ME TO MUCH MONEY TO SEND THEM BACK I WAS REALLY UNHAPPY AND WILL NOT ORDER FROM THAT COMPANY AGAIN. MY ORDER WAS 86.00 DOLLARS AND THE STOCKING HAD RUNS IN THEM.
5,Glitter Pantyhose,"I am located in the suburbs of Atlanta. I went shopping for these particular pantyhose and found that the affluent stores had them or did not have them; especially the size and color I required (Ivory). Also, the prices in the stores that did have them were $2-$3 more than what Amazon carried them for. The fit was perfect and I was very pleased with the merchandise."
4,TKZee Forever,"TKZee are the best ever. Halloween is a hot ablbum, and their newer one ""TKZee Family"" is even better. You have to hear them, all you, all over the world."
3,"High Sierra 26"" Railpass","I thought I had read a review or the description saying this coule be used as a carry on. But when I got it, it was much too large. I returned it and got the smaller 21"" version instead. If I were backpacking through Europe, I would have kept it though. It seems like a great pack, that could hold lots of stuff and had convenient zippers, pockets, and straps everywhere."
4,Railpass Travel Pack,I am pleased with this luggage. It is well made and durable. It is a bit heavy but that is due to the construction. I have carried it on a number of different types of airline flights and it has always complied (so far). I expect to get a lot of use from this luggage.
3,"Good concept, questionable design or quality","I love the idea of a really big bag that converts to two smaller bags, one medium and one small. It was perfect for travelling in Europe, as we could take the smaller bag for day trips or the medium bag for a couple of days. The individual bags are good, but the zipper connecting the small bag to the medium bag broke the first day I owned it. I was leaving for a trip that week and didn't want to go through a return so just lived with it. The little bag still attached well enough with the side straps, but it moved a bit while walking. I don't know if the zipper was bad or if the design put too much stress on it. I don't think I put a lot of force into attaching it. Anyway, we have used it since and still like it, but I was disappointed in the initial problem."
3,Fantastic Four Disassembled? Not really,"Fantastic Four Vol. 5: Disassembledcollects Fantastic Four #514-519. The Fantastic Four has always been the ultimate dysfunctional family and one of my favorite comics to read. But this collection ***SPOILER*** sees the apparent death of the wizard, thank The One-Above-All, but death is never real in comics. And so characters, even crappy ones, come back to life all the time.***END SPOILER*** The best book is the last one, issue #519 ""Fourtitude: Part 3"" in which Reed fundamentally changes the dynamics of the Fantastic Four. I could have lived without the 3-part ""Dysfunctional"" storyline and even the first 2-parts of the ""Fourtitude"" storyline, albeit they are essential. All in all worth picking up used for the second story arc. Why it's touted as an Avengers Disassembled story still eludes me though as it's only mentioned briefly that, ""...there are no Avengers..."""
3,Much harder than the actual test,"I just finished the shelf exam having studied this book exhaustively, and I honestly think there's simply too much detail. Endless questions on the details of Riley-Day syndrome, McCune-Albright syndrome, and parasites found only in Africa. The test was certainly not easy, but the bulk of it dealt with the more common diseases like Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. I'd go with blueprints first and foremost, maybe supplement with a question book like this one and don't get too caught up in the details of obscure diseases.In addition, some of the questions are just plain wrong now, such as questions on vaccination recommendations that are out-of-date.Overall, I'd still recommend this book, so long as you don't get too depressed over not knowing the hardest questions."
5,Delicious Product and Excellent Service!,This is the first time I have ordered Mariani California Apricots and I will definitely order them again. They are absolutely delicious! I also appreciate the fast service. Thank you!
1,Could have tasted better.,"The apricots were not what I expected, they didnt taste that great. They seemed liked they were older and were not that flavorful. I was expecting them to be like the pictures showed and have more flavor and be larger."
5,Dried Apricots,"I use many dried apricots in trail mixes and in homemade bread.I also eat them as a snack. I have tried many brands and varietiesand this brand is by far my favorite. They are always soft, easyto chew, and very flavorful. I am a repeat buyer and will continueto select these for health benefits and pleasurable eating."
3,comprehensive program,"I like that the curriculum encompasses dictation, spelling, grammar, writing, and critical thinking. I don't like the fact that they publishers don't offer a teacher's edition of answer key only. I suppose if you are reading it together with the student, you may need two copies, but it is redundant to me. I also am disappointed by the following: that by 8th-9th grade, they are still going over elementary and middle school concepts of common and proper nouns, and having students put a list of words (adverbs)into sentences: often, happily, down, etc. Too simple for 8th or 9th grade. Lastly, the ""book studies"" do not involve analysis but superficial observation or less. They are 2 pages long and it is unclear when you should start and finish the book since by the 3rd page, it goes right into the next sample from some other book or bible chapter. I'm not sure how that's a ""book study."""
5,Great!,"This is a great first book by Joanna Elm, almost impossible to put down. It's an easy read, full of suspense. One of the most original stories I've read in a long time."
2,Ready for measure to win The Palme d'Or,"Chahine is an esteemed director , when I see the reruns of some of his early material such as "" Bab El-Hadid"" , I marvel at the beauty and the simplicity of those films ,made in the pure neo-realist tradition. Yet ""The destiny"" is a weak and disconnected film , its main message is a ""politically correct"" one: there can be no strict adherence to a religious doctrine without fanaticism and to a certain extent terrorism , that message was almost tailored to please the western media , and Mr Chahine was rewarded with the much coveted Palme d'Or.I also agree with Mr Hefny the reviewer from Cairo , he blew a great opportunity for a serious treatment of the subject of political coercion in the name of religion . His decision to use egyptian slang as the language of Andalusia some 800 years ago is a farce and an insult to the intelligence of the arab viewer. With all due respects to Mr Chahine , we deserve better than this."
2,could have been something,"imagine the movie ""the ten commandements"" with a bronx or a brooklyn accent. thats what destiny feels like when you are an arabic speaker. the actors speak modern day egyptian accent which sounds completely silly to arabs considering that the setting of the movie is the 12th century spain. the idea could have been great if chahine would have stuck to historical accuracy. but i guess chahine dont care about his arab audience that much."
4,politcs and battles,"This gundam video is good,as are al of them. however , it has a lot more politcs than fighting. And dont be fooled by the cover, trowa barton, The Mercurius, and the Vayeate dont even show up. The compelling storyline and characters with realistic attitudes keep the episodes rolling at a good pace. No Gundam fan should be without."
4,What a delightfully odd movie!,"A girl is left with her uncle for the weekend (or a day, I think) while Mom runs off with her new boyfriend. She has one wish while she's there...to ride the Metro train...which, naturally, is on strike.Wackiness ensues.Shot largely as if it were a slapstick silent film, this is one wacky, odd romp around Paris. The Eiffel tower scenes are surely one-of-a-kind and worth the price of admission alone.You won't really find yourself laughing a lot so much as just marveling at the spectacle of the thing."
1,Won't Play on Newer Monitors,"Reel Deal Slots Nickels & More is apparently a very old game that cannot be played on newer, widescreen monitors. This game can only be played on an 800 x 600 monitor, or a monitor that is capable of showing an 800 x 600 monitor.It played fine on my six year old HP Pavilion, but that PC was dying. Purchased a new Dell Inspiron with a Dell 20"" LCD monitor and the game crashes every time.I contacted PhantomEFX and they said, ""When ""Nickels and More"" was designed years ago, 800x600 was the most common and standard screen resolution. Because of the design of the game, there is also no present option to adjust screen resolution within the game.""So beware. This game is apparently not so old that they stopped selling it, but too old to play on modern monitors. IMO it should not be sold if it won't work on most new computers and if they won't support it anymore."
3,Fun but troublesome,Game likes to quit working in the middle of adventure quests. Patch download from Phantom EFX did not fix. Brand new computer so I know its not the system. I would think twice about purchasing this product again.
5,Classic Cartland!,"Spy, cry, and sigh...one of Dame Barbara's classic novels is reprinted for our pleasure. This novel features an interesting, historically accurate setting and plot, a plucky, yet innocent heroine, and a Duke to die for, of course!"
5,Could This Be My Favorite Barbara Cartland???,"Possibly so! The parts with the French people are icky, but the descriptions of shoes and horses are fabulous-- and you'll sigh with envy when you read about the sink with the stained enamel! Only Cartland can whisk you out of normal life and into a realm of slightly retarded temptresses and virile hairy MEN: real MEN who don't wear pomade and drink bad beer. Sit down, light up a snifter, and read ""The Little Pretender."" You won't know whether you like it 'til you've read it (or a portion of it if you don't like it and set it aside and forget about it)."
1,Stay Away,"We had a DCS-900 for several years. Other than the occasional re-boot never had an issue. This was the replacement. Right away we never could get 33 of 36 computers to be able to access it (all 36 worked fine with the DCS-900). Technical support was a joke, ""lower the security on the computers and remove the old activeX object installed by the DCS-900"". Turning off security didn't help (like we were going to do that for any length of time). We couldn't find and they couldn't say what the activeX object was we were supposed to be deleting (nice job, most reputable companies sign their objects). Now the thing has gone totally toes up after just a couple of weeks. Guess what, D-Link says no returns under any circumstances, deal with your vendor. If we can't get it going in a day or so, hopefully Amazon will take it back/exchange it."
3,okay when it works,"The DCS-5300 only works with Internet Explorer, which is okay.The DCS-5300 lets you remotely control the camera, which is okay.The DCS-5300 reboots itself every 24 hours from when you plugged it in, which is okay.My DCS-5300 doesn't always respond to the remote control requests, which is not okay, but it will reboot in 24 hours and some times that fixes this problem, so that makes it okay.It's just okay. For $250, I wanted more than okay."
4,Good and bad of DCS-5300,"2) The cameras are not really low light and do not work well with IR emitters. I tired one brand of emitter and it was useless, I returned the emitter.3) They don't work relly well in high contrast, faces against a bright window."
3,Nice Camera shame about the IP software.,"The camera is a nice design, fair quality image and easy to set up.The enclosed web-based software from Dlink is nice and easy to handle and does the job cleanly and simply.Exactly what you want from a home or small office camera system to monitor activity.However, I purchased the cameras (2) because of the description of the IP security suite that was supposed to come with it, allowing 16 cameras to be monitored and recorded simultaneously.Rubbish....! The software was terrible and recording just one camera was a pain, then playing it back was even worse.It's hard to describe just how bad that software was.Cameras were nice though."
3,Dont buy used,I've bought 4 Dlink DCS-5300 cameras. 3 brand new and 1 used witch was out of order. I believe Amazon don't check products sold used.
3,Tag team ladder match carried the whole show,"No Mercy 1999 was an okay ppv. the tag team terri invatational ladder match was the best match on the card. it is one of the best matches of 1999. the main vent was okay. Ididdnt like the ending. The Mankind vs. Val Venis match was a bore, along with the rock vs. the british bulldog. so in conclusion there wre really onlt 2 good matchs at No Mercy 1999."
4,One Match Card,"I'm sure you're looking at this card for one match-the Ladder Match. The Terri Invitational Finals right here is generally considered the greatest ladder match ever; better than either two HBK-Razor Ramon bouts, Summerslam 98's HHH vs Rock, and a few other lesser known ladder matches. Unfortunately, the ladder match is all that this tape has going for it. If that's the only reason you wanted this tape, then i suggest trying to get a hold of a lesser known home video- WWF-Best of 1999. This has the complete ladder match as well as some other great matches like Test/Shane from Summerslam 99. Hope this helps."
3,Not Too Hot,"The PPV, in whole, was fairly lukewarm. By far, the best match was the Ladder Match. The Championship Match was pretty good, too. I can't even remember the rest of the matches!"
4,I'v got 2 words 4 you: LADDER MATCH,"What can I say, the best ladder match ever, the Hardy Boyz are quicly becoming my favorite lightweigt/cruiserweight wrestlers. I just hope those insane moves of theirs don't cut their careers short with an injury.Rest of the pay per view was great too. I just love watching Moolah and Mae Young be kicked around. Real gutsy of them."
2,WWF NO MERCY 1999,THIS WAS A FAIR WWF PPV. THE BEST MATCH WAS THE WWF TITLE MATCH BETWEEN STONE COLD AND TRIPLE H. ANOTHER GOOD MATCH WAS THE TAG TEAM LADDER MATCH BETWEEN THE HARDYZ AND EDGE AND CHRISTIAN. THE OTHER MATCHES WERE VERY BORING.
4,Buy Before Source Tags & Codes,"Madonna has it all. Crunching guitars, melodies, bombast, etc., but it's quieter moments are what make it stand out, if not above Source Tags & Codes, then pretty close. Aged Dolls sounds simple, almost boring at first, but it creates such a creepy mood, sucking you in to keep listening. The crecendos are beautiful. Clair de Lune is another pretty song unmatched by by anything in ST&C except maybe ""After the Laughter"". Throw in thrashers like Mistakes & Regrets, A Perfect Teenhood, and Totally Natural, and it's almost the perfect rock album. If only they would dispense with the minute long noodling (filler) that is distracting and the god-awful Sigh Your Children (Conrad does not sound good at all with just an acoustic guitar. Counting Off the Days from their new ep is another sad example). But I'm being picky. Buy Madonna before ST&C. If just to see their musical progression."
3,Rough prototype,"Noisy, slop-pretty indie-garage rock that lacks the honed melodic attacks of future releases, though virtually had the formula intact, with a youthful urgency overriding some of the work."
2,They got better,"Love this band--and I'm probably one of the few people who like their new material more, and believe they got better as musicians. This album--as much as I like it fierceness, is almost unlistenable. The band is all over the place, some of the stuff just doesn't connect. When it does, like on ""Flood Of Red"" and ""Mistakes And Regrets"", it predicts better things to come on the 'Source Tags & Codes' album, where their sound and songs just gelled better.Trail of Dead definitely have (had) their own thing going: it's not quite punk, it's not at all prog, but it borrows liberally from these genres and more. The scattershot singing and sections where the band all get off-time here just seem to belie a dashed-off quality in the recording. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but with material as thin as this, it just grates."
4,Replacement for 1992 Toyota Corolla,"Pros: Replaced old antenna that was broken.Cons: No instructions. Luckily I have a friend that is very car savvy, so it wasn't too much of a problem for him. If you aren't car savvy or don't know someone that is, it will get frustrating."
5,Same as OEM Toyota Corolla 94,It is the same as the OEM Toyota Corolla 94 antena that is used in most of the 90' models of toyota sold in Venezuela
2,dental ball better,"Was hard to keep it filled and my puppy didnt like to play with it for some reason, she liked the other ball they have the dental one much better. One plus..it bounces good."
5,The best,"Our dog loves this ball. We have looked locally for it and no stores have it. Can't wait to go outside and play ""red ball""."
4,Not Just for Dogs?,"I bought this to entertain my dog while she recovered from surgery. When I first gave the ball to her, with Get Naked Dental Sticks protruding, the cat showed more than a passing interest. So much so that I had to put the dog and ball into her crate to get away from the cat!My dog never was into balls or chasing them around, but she enjoys this one because of the treats. But she wouldn't work that hard once the treat broke off and the rest remained in the ball. After a few times of my intervening, with her watching, she'll now try (albeit unsuccessfully) to get the rest of the treat out herself. Today, she actually chewed on the ball for some 10 minutes trying to get at the treat. Maybe she'll get better at this as time goes on."
5,My dog has a ball with his Kong ball!,"The order arrived in perfect condition. Brand new still in original packaging. I am very pleased. My dog loves his Kong Ball, I enjoy watching him try to get to his treats hidden inside."
5,Kong Large Biscuit Ball,"I bought this Kong Biscuit Ball about two weeks ago for my newly-adopted German Shepherd Dog. My oberservations are:1) The Kong is made from very solid and durable hard rubber.2) The openings are large so it is easy to put in biscuits, but ordinary dog food will easily fall out.3) My dog plays with the ball infrequently. Usually only when there are treats inside. However, I'm sure all dogs are different.4) The Kong should last a long time even if it's constantly chewed on."
3,How big of a treat do you need??,"One of the holes for treats is ridiculously large. Need a very large treat for it not to just fall out when the ball rolls over. On a positive note, it seems very durable."
2,Rocket's mom doesn't like!,"The holes are WAY too big in this. NOTHING will stay in it for even a second. It's ok as a plain ball to play with, but you can get balls much cheaper."
2,Eh,"Not an awful product. Holes were mostly too big to put anything in, food comes out too easily. Meaning dog is bored with it after a few seconds. Not bad, I suppose, but didn't do much for my dog."
3,Nice Heavy Cricket Bat good for hard tennis cricket ball,This is nice bat good for hard tennis cricket ball. weight is little heavy its not sort of light bats so be prepare to have couple of grips to make sure its feels little light. I just bought it few days back looks ok till now center spot is quite sweet to hit the ball. so purchase it if you have some patience while playing and would not recommend for hard hitting sloggers.
5,Beautiful underwater footage,"This is a truly amazing collection of underwater films. Anyone who likes fish, sharks, the beauty that lives in the ocean or is interested in oceanic conservation will love this set. I've been watching it with my son who is really interested in this kind of stuff since going to the aquarium. We have both learned a lot."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this thinking it was by the makers of Planet Earth. Not so! (If you're looking for that it's called ""Blue Planet"", which I do recommend). The quality of Planet Ocean was very poor. Although it says 2008, most of the footage is quite dated. I was very disappointed with the narrative as well."
1,misleading marketing ploy,"If you're willing to make the best of it, mute the sound entirely to create an opportunity to imagine what they could be saying. In every case that would be more interesting and sound better than what they are saying. As well, you can save yourself from becoming subject to the crappiest audio track of all time. Then you're set to view vintage washed-out footage and hang onto the idea that you haven't gotten screwed. After those four seconds are over be prepared to accept that you have been. In this instance SCUBA means sorry, caution unconditionally and boldly advised."
3,Rating problems,"The shoes are great, but I had a problem with the size: TOO BIG they didn't fit, I tried them on to see it they would fit but they didn't fit. You said, if I tried them on, I couldn't return them because I opened the package, so I doubled the socks and wear them. I like the style so I wear them. I would buy from them again if I wanted anthor pair of shoes..."
1,"Nice lightweight bag, but received the wrong one","This sleeping bag is fine, but I did not get the butterfly patterned one I ordered. (I got a princess patterned one that I am not fond of.) It was too close to when I needed it to be able to return it. So afraid I cannot give a positive review."
5,Great dry wall tool,Rotozip has been around a long time and has been my tool of choice. Love the 50-foot cord and strong perfofmance.
1,Another with disk 3 only,Sign me up as another that only received disk number 3. Waiting for my money back so I can stop elsewhere
1,Not Impressed,Way to go Warner Brother. Thanks for charging us the same for less. I was expecting Season Three Packaging to match Season One and Two but be warned it does not. If you do not care about tidy collections then this does not interest you. If you want all three seasons to match than good luck because they will not!!! Warner Brothers decided to get cheap on us.
4,love it,we are huge fans of the Clone wars in my house (Mom included) and have been watching the episodes nonstop since Christmas.
4,One of the Best Seasons,"Nice packaging and cover art. The inserts are minimal, but the episodes are some of the best. I forgot how great season 3 was. It's an excellent mix of episodes for younger viewers (the droids, Jar-Jar, etc.) mixed with darker episodes for more ""mature"" Star Wars fans."
4,"Mmmm, lost a little steam","I rated season 1 and 2 of this show as five stars. I'm only giving season 3 four stars. The animation still looks great, but they lost some creativity in the packaging, and the storytelling. Too many episodes dealing with politics that quite frankly got boring in several spots. However, the finale was great because......wait for it.....CHEWBACCA shows up! And it was worth the wait to see my favorite wookiee given the full animation treatment with Peter Mayhew (the original Chewbacca himself) doing the vocalizations! I have high hopes for season 4."
2,WARNING: NOT A DIGIBOOK!,"Great show, but I'm PISSED that it isn't packaged in digibook packaging like the first two seasons! That's one of the things I loved about collecting this series. I am VERY disappointed."
3,Really?,Ok 1st I would like to say that The Clone wars is great period the reason for the 3 Stars is much like everyone elses review but whats the deal with changing the packaging? Its not that its bad its that its not a book anymore its just your typical blue ray case. THis is a let down but still doesnt take away the quality of the show
5,fantastico,the best star wars: the clone wars of the 4 seasons out. fantastic stories and characters. we are totally obsessed.
4,Well loved,My son just discovered Star Wars and is totally obsessed! So it's nice to be able to find old episodes so he can see the series from the beginning.
5,More Star Wars goodness.,"I absolutely loved seasons one and two.And season three carries on the fine tradition of excellent story telling.Beautiful animation.Excellent voice acting.Awesome score.And.....DARTH MAUL!!!Well...not Maul, but his species makes an appearance in this.So awesome.I heard that Maul will be resurrected for season four.I for one CANNOT wait as he was easily my favorite character from the new trilogy.If you liked both seasons then you have to watch this.Simply brilliant.Recommended."
2,"No Foil sleeve like 1,2, and 4??? Repackage or New?","I'm sure the episodes are fine, but the other seasons all come in the standard Blu-Ray Plastic Disc Box with a raised cardboard sleeve. season 3 only comes in the plastic case. Awkward. Makes me think this was repackaged without the cardboard cover... clearly a disturbance in the Force and the work of the Dark Side."
1,only 1 disc,"This is missing disc 1 and 2. The case is only for one disc, and it had Disc 3. The cover says Complete Season Three. Not good."
1,WE ALREADY KNOW ANAKIN IS DARTH VADER!,"WHAT IS GEIRGE LUCAS THINKING BY MAKING A CARTOON OF ""THE CLONE WARS?!!!"" FOR THOSE OF US THAT SAW THE FIRST T3 MOVIES WHEN THEY CAME OUT IN THE 70S; WE KNOW THAT ANAKIN'S DARTH VADER!!! IN MY OPINION, LUCAS, JUST WANTED YET ANOTHER AVENUE TO MAKE MONEY!!! AS IF HE NEEDS MORE!!! THIS IS A CRUEL TRICK YOU PLAYED ON STAR WARS FANS!!!! NO I REALLY QUESTION LUCAS'S CREDIBILITY & MY ""ALLEGIANCE!!""!!!!"
1,"Great Season, Horrible Set!","Why set a standard with Seasons 1 & 2, and then release Season 3 with lame contemporary packaging, and no concept art booklet (something I love to look at)? A huge disappointment in that department. Season 3 was great and had a lot of innovative story ideas and themes. It's a shame Lucasfilm Licensing decided to cheapen that by skimping on this release. I bought the Blu-Ray set expecting the same things the previous sets had. The ball has been dropped."
1,way overpriced,Almost $30 for a 22 minute movie? Seriously? My wife bought this thinking it was full length. Big mistake. Should have been more clear on the purchase flow.
1,Bad DVD,Disc one of this set doesn't work. This is the second time I bought this DVD from a different place and I still get Clone Wars Season 3 DVD that has a bad disc one. I don't know what's going on. I didn't realize I could take it back once I opened it.
3,Great Season,Great season some of the best episodes but very disappointed they went cheap on the packaging. The coolest part of The Clone Wars DVD's was how nice the packaging was with the booklet in the middle lots of artwork and extras and just a top notch product. This is just a slim casing with a cheap foldout inside they really messed this up.
3,Episode Missing?,"Is it just my set or is there an episode missing? There is an episode missing between ""Evil Plans"" and ""Hunt For Ziro"". How do you go from plotting the breakout of Ziro to he has escaped the bounty hunters and is on the run?"
4,A nice read.,"If you enjoyed watching The Walton's on TV, you will probably enjoy Spencer's Mountain, since apparently the show was based-on this book. The names are different, and you get a greater sense of the financial and social challenges facing the family, and there is no radio for the family to gather around after dinner, but it is very much the same story. If you can get past the differences in the names, you will be rewarded with a pleasant read, especially if read just before you drift off to sleep at night. Good night, John-boy."
5,Spencer's Mountain,"Spencer's Mountain written by Earl Hamner is the book that inspired ""The Walton's"" television series and the movie ""Spencer's Mountain"". The book was well written and gave you a lens into life in the Virginia mountains during the depression era. The story is not as clean cut as ""The Walton's"" giving you a more realist life experience. Clay-boy's love interest showed the innocence of the time and by its simplicity seemed to make it all the more lifelike from the viewpoint of a young man in that time and place. One of my personal favourite parts of the story was the antics of Clay Spenser (Clay-boy's father) fishing and drinking with the new preacher, Goodman, I will not ruin the story with what happens, but I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
2,good performance of 2 uninteresting works,"I'm a big fan of 20th century ballet, especially Prokofiev and Stravinsky. Not being familiar with Roussel's work I snatched this up on the basis of some positive reviews I read. I was disappointed. The two ballets on this disc are rather conservative works more reminiscent of Delibes or Minkus than the extraordinary works that Diaghilev was commisioning at the time. Fans of 19th century ballet may like it more than I did."
5,"Tengo la edición en castellano: ""Cultivos Hidropónicos 4/Ed""","Soy un iniciado en el cultivo hidropónico, y con este libro he logrado el apoyo necesario para estimular mi emprendimiento. Dentro de poco, obtendré la primer cosecha y llegaré al autor para acercarle los resultados. Lo felicito por la claridad y simplicidad alcanzada en todos los temas tratados, de por sí complejos para los neófitos como yo. Resalto el capítulo referido a ""Cultivo en Agua"" !!!"
2,Am I Missing Something Here?,"Maybe it's because I haven't read Moon of Three Rings, but this book didn't appeal to me at all. This is the first Andre Norton book I ever read, and I wasn't very impressed. It all focuses on the main character's low self esteem. It's boring. It reminds me of Moon Called, just not as bad. The characters are great, and so are the descriptions. But the dialogue is too formal, and the plot is dull."
4,Very well written,"Andre Norton is one of my favorite authors,so when I saw this book I had to get it.At first it's a little slow but you get drawn into the story very quickly."
4,Mass is superb; Te Deum is irritating,"I'm familiar with Valery Polyansky and the RSS Orchestra & Cappella, and they've floored me again with this CD. Mass in D Major is a stunning piece of art. It reminds me of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis for its ethereal atmosphere; that's how good this is. The ""Kyrie"" and ""Benedictus"" sequences are a treat for the ears.The one big problem I have with this CD is the Te Deum. Personally, I find this piece overly verbose and dull. It didn't work for me. The soloists did a good job, however.If it weren't for the Te Deum, I would've given this an A+. Instead, it's a B+. Very good CD, and still recommendable."
2,Not what I expected,I understand how to read music and have knowledge of most key signatures. That's where my knowledge of music theory ends. The author assumes the reader has a fairly advanced knowledge of music theory so much of this book is like reading Greek to me. Might prove helpful if I do a lot of background research. I thought other might want to know this before buying.
4,"""For Fans Only"" Fun on the high seas","Well, this kind of came out of the blue. I haven't talked to one person who knew this was coming out before it hit the stores. Anyway, in my mind June of 44 can do no wrong, so I really enjoy what's on this little EP. However, this is a Fishtank session, which means that this is sort or self-indulgence and isn't meant to be an album proper. If you're a fan, get it. An added incentive...anyone who saw June of 44 recently and heard a few songs you'd never heard before...they're on here"
3,"A nice sequel, but still not a good as the XL version","I bought this with eager anticipation and hopes of seeing something above and beyond the XL version. didn't really match my hopes, but still this is fun game, if you like the series its worth getting, but if you have to choose a good racer, get Wipeout XL first!"
3,Okay game .......,"Wipeout is getting a little long-in-the-tooth. Great game, but you can only add so much before getting redundant. Stop with the sequels. Make a different game with different challenges."
3,A SLICE OF SCHLOCK WITH EXTRA CHEESE,"Though the reviews of this movie have been very harsh, it is obvious that many people have unrealistic expectations regarding this movie. First of all, the film is called American Vampire, not ""An American Vampire Story."" Secondly, the film was made on a shoestring budget and was designed to be 90 minutes of light-hearted cheese. I think the director did a good job taking a lousy script and low budget and creating a vibe that makes this a cult classic in terms of being endearingly bad. Not quite horror, not quite comedy, and not quite good, but, ah, lots of cheese...enjoy."
1,Worst...Movie...Ever,"I purchased this after seeing several positive reviews for a film called American Vampire and after having a friend recommend it. I had been told that it was a great vampire movie.Either I was lied to, or there are two movies named ""American Vampire"" (I checked IMDB...there aren't). Oddly I can't find any of the reviews now, and the friend claims not to remember any such recommendation.Anyway, this is a terrible movie..plot makes no sense, acting is terrible, even the Adam West cheese factor can't save it. It's barely even a vampire movie...Save your money for something good."
1,Completely awful -- not even fun to laugh at.,"Granted, I did NOT expect this movie to be any good but as a self proclaimed cheesy horror movie expert I certainly expected it to be (unintentionally) funny. However, other than Adam West's involvement, this movie was completely unremarkable (Adam West was his usual self but I figured there would be a few self refferential jokes like the ones from Drop Dead Gorgeous... there wasn't a single one, even the quite obvious Vampire Bat - Batman connection).Of little note is Carmen Electra's ""starring"" role in this. Despite what the cover box may have you believe, she has maybe 5-10 lines and flubs NONE of them so it's not really worth watching for her either.Needless to say I'm very pleased that I didn't buy this."
2,You got vamps in your crib?,"This movie is about a group of vampires who crash at a guy's house while his parents are away. As their odd behavior becomes an increasing inconvenience, he elicits the help of a professional vampire hunter. Van Helsingmeister, played by Batman's Adam West. If this all seems like a cool, campy idea, I would agree.The movie drags on slowly during the first 75% of the movie as dogs and cats in the neighborhood disappear, etc. By the time the vampire hunter enters the picture, the movie is beyond saving. The final half hour was a last chance for the movie to start getting good, but, it does not.Great idea and movie concept, but the script just falls way short in keeping the action advancing and giving some action at the end the audience is waiting for. The acting was pretty bad, but Carmen Electra actually did a credible job as the seductive vampiress. Overall, I give it 2 stars for a good concept, but this one is strictly for the diehard vampire movie fans."
4,Could be the next cult classic!,"Such a fun film! Not to be taken too seriously, American Vampire is a fun story that centers around the premiss of what do you do when vampires come to stay?! This film struck me as a John Hughes meets Underworld!! A easy film to sit down and watch at anytime. The cast alone is great ranging from such veteran actors as Adam West to the humble beginnings of Carmen Electra. Overall totally entertaining!"
2,Huge disappointment,"The DVD case is clearly targeted toward fans of Carmen Electra who is barely even in it. Buy ""The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human"" if you want a funny movie she actually stars in. This movie barely held my interest all."
2,Slow and boring...,This one had a chance to be something really good. It isn't though. I had to put it on twice because I fell asleep the first time. I almost fell asleep the second time too. Save your time and money.
1,Bad,This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Parts of it also really creeped me out. The plot was lame. And not even funny lame.I guess the best thing about it was Carmen Electra.
2,Lame Vampire Films,"There are different kinds of vampire films. This one falls into that oh so cherished category of intentionally hoaky and bad. If your only goal from a vampire film is to see half naked vampire women seducing young men, well then, you might be satisified with this second rate vampire picture. After all, you can't beat Carmen Electra as a seductress. However, everything else about this film is beyond the usual bad and goes straight to toilet city. If you want to see simular vampire films, but with better quality, check out The Fearless Vampire Killers or Beverly Hills Vamp."
1,Pure Cheese !,"This film has all of the ingredients for a bad cheesy movie ! Bad plot, Bad acting, former TV stars fighting their way through the script. You even see the sound boom in a few scenes. I thought it may be good to rent for a laugh or 2,but it didn't happen. Adam West couldn't save this one .Much like his Tv sidekick, Burt Ward ( Beach Babes from Beyond),Adam West seems to make 'B' movies to let the world know he is still alive. Thank goodness there wasn't a sequel.If you want a better choice in Sexy vampire videos, try Vamps-Deadly Showgirls. More babes,more Vampire action and a better plot."
5,Awesome Course!,"As a home schooled high school student, I was transformed into a history fanatic thanks to this study guide. It provided the perfect blend of fiction and nonfiction reading assignments, providing excellent, thorough overviews of major time periods. The nonfiction books in this study were as exciting and interesting as nonfiction can get--there was nothing textbook-ish about them. The novels assigned provided a fun method of learning, and the accompanying study questions ensured that I learned history through each and every chapter.I've retained much of what I learned through this study seven years ago because it was so enjoyable to work through. I never could have compiled such an ideal combination of books for a thorough US history study. The Beautiful Feet cirriculum proved to be the perfect course for my 9th and 10th grade years. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good overview of this time span."
4,Intelligence comes as standard on Y2K model homo sapien...,"....Though many models apparently degrade through ill use or neglect.Hello?? Are we thinking yet?? Whilst it is a great shame that La Jetee is not presented in both English and French on this DVD release, a measure which would have been inexpensive, simple and after all one of the great things about this technology, it is absurd and ignorant of the reviewers here to complain on the grounds of it being some dumb hollywood machine decision and disrespectful to this wonderful film. Just to reiterate what has already been stated plainly...THE ENGLISH-VOICE VERSION IS THE ONE PREFERED BY CHRIS MARKER HIMSELF. now shut up. think before you speak. take the time to know what you're talking about.And anybody considering buying this film...how can you not? It's quite simply beautiful."
1,A travesty,"Although I read the review which lamented that ""La Jetée"" was dubbed into English, I took a chance, hoping that the default audio track was in English and that an alternate track in French was present. I was wrong. This is appalling. If I could send it back, I would."
3,La Jetée is in English only,"I bought this DVD hoping it would give me La Jetée with the original French soundtrack, having already bought the VHS version with the awful English soundtrack (whatever the director may say about it! -- see other review). Sadly the DVD does not provide alternative sound tracks for La Jetée -- it's in English only."
2,yeah go with Criterion Collection,La Jetée is one of the most incredible science fiction films ever made. See it the right way with the Criterion Collection release. This short series sucks too because the disc is loaded with annoying ads.
3,Better than nothing!!!,"Okay, La Jetee is in English, but at least it's on DVD. And extra points for Gilliam for doing a phoned-in commentary, considering his film was only slightly based on the short."
3,"Nice reissue, bit of a botched job...","Warner's, in reissuing this excellent disc, has added some audio commentary, but deleted some material. I imagine most people will buy this to see La Jetee, but they will miss the excellent documentary ""The making of Portrait of a Lady,"" which was included on side 2 of the old version.Oh well.Warner's has also redone the menus and removed some fairly humorous interstitials.Oh well again. Warner's are not known for their aesthetics (see the Eyes Wide Shut censored disc, for example) as much for their attention to the bottom line."
2,La Jetee -- English language version!,"Please note: I bought this DVD solely for La Jetee and had to return it when I found out that the version on ""Short 2: Dreams"" is the dreadful English language version. I have read elsewhere that Chris Marker approved this version as well as the French one, and that he allegedly liked this one better. I only hope this isn't true, since I consider La Jetee in French to be one of the great masterpieces in all of film and I have no use for the English-language version. Buyer beware!La Jetee in French is hard to find on DVD in the U.S., but worth the search."
2,bijouflix-for French,"If you're looking for a dvd copy of la jetee in french (with english subtitles), check out bijouxflix. I just got mine in the mail, and the copy is grainy but otherwise intact."
2,La Jetee in English?,"Short 2 - Dreams was overall a disapointment. I bought it strictly for La Jetee (Chris Marker) which, naturally, loses a great deal of eloquence in English, as it appears on the DVD. But it remains an incontrovertably wonderful film. Other than the section by/about Gary Hickenlooper, nothing on the DVD deserves a second viewing. The Hickenlooper pieces, while of interest, are not really engrossing, although I may venture into watching The Big Brass Ring at full length. The long and short of it is this: if you know and love La Jetee enough to want an English version, this is a good buy. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,Pretty Darn Good!,To be honest the only reason I bought it was because that beautiful man Adam is in it. I was surprised at how good this movie is! It is a well written and acted movie and can be very funny at times. I wont go into the plot because you just read about it a minute ago. If you buy Adam's movies- then this one is a must.
4,Murder is a dying art - From the back cover . . .,"Ex-Rocker Adam Ant plays James Callendar, an uptown L.A. art dealer on the downswing with his creditors. His Porsche will be past tense if he doesn't pay up in full. But Callendar makes a sly discovery: The problem with all the art hanging in his gallery is that all of its creators are still alive. If he could just find the right artist - talented and . . . terminal.Sam Brown (David Packer) provides the perfect patsy. He's a gifted but gullible artist whose total lack of interest in commercial success has Callendar foaming at the mouth with greed. Can Callendar solve the tricky problem of Sam's stubborn good health - or will Sam become a late, great legend? It's a comically shocking situation."
2,cheap,Easy review.. this will only last you about 4 uses . I bought it like 3 weeks ago and I hadn't REALLY put it to real use. Just maybe 10 to 15 pictures. at avery casual pace.So then today Sat oct 25th I had a shoot with a model. I'm flashing away like a photo every 3 to 10 second and into the 40'th picture the flash starts smoking and I could SEE the plastic getting soft and disfigured.So my review is this is a flash for very casual occasional use the fact it is bundled with other stuff is a sign that this isn't to be though of as your flash for life.
5,Don't know why everyone is hating...,"I've never left a product review, and today I decided to contribute a few reviews to my favorite and least favorite appliances. I was shocked to see the low ratings for this rice cooker. I got mine three months ago as a wedding gift. I've used it maybe five times and haven't had any problems! It cooks rice quickly and evenly. I was surprised to hear that this appliance burned rice for most of these reviews because that has never happened to me. I use the 1 cup white rice : 1 and 1/2 cup water ratio that is recommended with the instructions. I add a little more water for stickier rice, a little less for fluffier rice. I definitely recommend this product!"
1,worked great for four uses -- then died,"like other reviewers have experienced, ours burned out after using it about four times. There's some small component inside that seems to be dead. Would not recommend."
1,Bad Item,We bought this item with a gift card. We were so excited about getting a rice cooker. It worked for 3 weeks and then just stopped. First the light went out so we didn't know if it was done or not and it didn't ding anymore. Then it stopped heating up at all. I'm very disappointed with this item and don't think I'll be buying an Oyster rice cooker again.
4,Reliable and Inexpensive,"We keep buying the same Oster rice cooker every 2-3 years.....We use it everyday, so it does wear out. If you leave it on warm for too long, then it will form a crust at the bottom, but it comes off very easily. After awhile, sometimes it under cooks the rice, but if left on warm, it will cook thoroughly. Overall, we have found this rice cooker very useful and dependable...We love the rice that it cooks!"
1,Oster 4715 rice cooker review,"The design of the product is not bad for the price. But the reliability of the product is quite a minus. After using for less than 10 times, the rice cooker stopped turning on!"
1,Don't buy this rice cooker,"I bought this rice cooker on sale from Kohl's. Initially I thought it was pretty good since the rice was cooked nicely and the pot was easy to clean. However, as I use it more often, it turns out to be the worst rice cooker that I ever had. Usually, from my experience, a rice cooker can keep rice warm and moist for 2 or 3 days without any problems. For some reasons, this rice cooker cant do that. The rice became too dry at the bottom, mushy in places where water drains down from the lid or, worse, spoiled on the second day. I bought other brands at about the same price before and never had any problem like that. At first, I thought it was the faucet water that caused the problem, since I just moved to a new place. But the problem still continues even after I used bottle water to cook the rice. So my advice is stay away from this rice cooker, unless you plan to cook and finish all the rice right away."
1,Please invest in a better cooker!,"We received this rice cooker as a Christmas gift and replacement for one broken on our move back from Korea. Immediately, we had issues. I found it almost impossible to make decent, wet or sticky rice without burning the bottom. The warmer feature always burned the bottom, making it useless. After a month or so, the seal on the lid broke, unexplainably, and we had to jury rig it to make it work. Finally, in May, the whole thing just quit working one night. We make a lot of rice and maybe this thing wasn't meant for every or every other day use. I don't know, but I do not recommend it!"
1,Absolutely Useless,"I received this cooker as a wedding present, and I couldn't be more disappointed with it. This cooker will FRY TO HELL any rice you cook in it. Period. I tried putting the recommended 2.5-1 ratio of water to rice, and the rice got burned. I even tried using a 4-1 ratio, and it still burned.I am not surprised at all to see the entire Oster line of rice cookers loaded with bad reviews. Even though we got this as a gift, I still feel ripped off. Do your research on rice cookers and stay FAR away from anything with the ""Oster"" name attached."
4,Still doing well after more than three years,"This rice cooker has no fancy feature but it has worked well for us. We bought ours from Macy over three years ago. The non-stick coating is beginning to wear thin. But that is not surprising since we use it every single day. We use the measuring cup that comes with it to measure the rice (good quality Chinese, Japanese, or Korean rice, no Uncle Ben) and put in water according to the marking in the pot. We get good rice every time. It is true that if we leave it at ""warm"" for a while, a thick hard crust would form at the bottom. But for us, we usually unplug it as soon as it finishes cooking so this rarely happens. When it does, we would take whatever above it and pour in half a cup of water. The crust comes off easily after 15 minutes or so and it is still pretty good for eating. :-)"
1,Oster Model 4715 a Great BOAT ANCHOR - DEAD !,"I used this Rice Cooker for almost 2 weeks, 3 times a week. So, that's 7-8 uses and it just went dead. Stopped right in the middle of cooking 2 cups of rice. Lights went out and that was it. Won't turn on, won't light up , won't do a darn thing. I see that many reviewers are reporting the same problem. I'm getting a refund and buying something else that's NOT an OSTER Product. Now, If you're looking for a good Boat Anchor ...... buy one of these turds, tie it up to your boat, and heave it overboard. Should hold you there while you fish. Stay away from Oster Products so you don't waste your time and hard earned money !"
2,Burns the rice and burns out quickly,"I have to agree with the other reviews that are negative on this rice cooker. When you cook rice in this item, it burns/toasts the rice on the bottom. I tried to take the pot out as soon as it was done, but the rice was still ruined on the bottom of the pot. It stays too hot during the warm cycle, so it continues to cook the rice. We had this for less than a year before it went out on us. I would not recommend this to anyone. There are less expensive items on Amazon that have much better reviews than this item."
2,Funny Not Original,I have three CD's from Mike. Most of the same material on each one.He needs to take a break and get some different routines for the next release.But Birbiglia's timing and content are hilarious
3,All in all..it's an OK CD,"The Olsen twins are cute and all, but I was very annoyed that most of the singing on this album is not them, but backround singers. I guess all in all it is an ok CD, but keep in mind that there is a lot of non-Mary-Kate and Ashley!"
1,YUCK.,"YUCK. It's the Olsen Twins, the two most exploited child stars in the world. They can't sing, but hey, they have blonde hair and blue eyes. We can some make money off of them."
5,Great for giving u that christmas feeling!!,"This album is so great. It gives you a great festive feeling and mary-kate and ashley are at their best for singing. I love it, guess u'll jus have to buy it to find out for yourself. If you love the twins it's a must."
1,Ummmmm..........this isn't really good.,"Ok....I know I'll probably get like 1,000,000 emails of hatemail, but don't get this CD. They barely sing and when they do, you can't hear them. I think that they are overpaid snobs. They can't sing or dance! Once again, I hope I haven't offended anyone. But I'm just stating my opinion. Instead of buying this, buy: MANDY MOORE'S ""SO REAL"", or BRITNEY SPEARS ""...OOPS I DID IT AGAIN"". Thanks"
1,Outdated predictions about the world already in the past.,"There was something about this book that was not quite right. Originally written in the late 1950's, this book lacks the creativity of Clarke's full novels.Perhaps Clarke has discovered this also, because recently he stays with short diatribes on television shows and co-authors most of his recent works.This book is only for the collector looking to complete their Arthur C. Clarke collection."
5,Beautiful performance of a Moving Work,"Schmidt's Fourth Symphony should be counted as a modern masterpiece. Like the Gorecki 3rd, it is not necessarily foreshadowed in his other works. There is a quality of Bruckner and Elgar here, with lots of nobililty. This work was written in the aftermath of the death of his little daughter, and it is filled with sorrow. But there is hope also. Most beautiful is the 2nd movement which has a gut-wrenching climax at its center. No one else could have written this moving work. The Strauss is just the opposite: showy and glittery, with not much substance. Jarvi once again plays this music with authority and the Chandos sound is full and well-bodied. Listen to the Schmidt 4th-you'll be glad you did!"
5,"Useful tool to expose lies ""good christian"" women believe...","I am currently doing this study in a small group, and it is amazing how many of the ""lies"" or variations we believe, even though we say otherwise. This book covers lies about who God is, who we are, the relationship we should have with Him, and what happened to it, and lies that affect our relationships with others. It calls sin what it is, sin. Most important, it tells how to counter-act lies with the Truth from God's Word, the Bible. Many women are in bondage to habits and sins they cannot break free from, the Good News is that Jesus can and will set you free."
5,Thought Provoking Guide,"I have just started a study of ""Lies Women Believe"" with a group of ladies at my church. This guide encourages you to search your heart and deal with the lies Satan has told you about yourself. You may even discover some things that you didn't know were lies."
5,A good study manual,This workbook style manual will help you get the most out of the book. It's a great way for women to discover who they are and why they think the way they do.
4,Good Bible Study for Women,"I taught this to a group of women of all ages -- and they all said they got something out of it. Each ""lie"" will not apply to every woman, but I guarantee everyone will find a few ""lies"" they've believed."
1,Is this book worth purchasing?,This was a disappointing book purchase because the material is based on information that is readily available with the purchase of a flex-shaft. The price of the book is out of line with the value of information in the book. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
1,For wealthy beginner only,"This softcover, 8.5 x 5.5, 78 page book is extravagantly overpriced for what it offers. Seriously, if you already own a flex-shaft, you already know what it has to say. It is one long (or short, depending on your view) advertisement for 3M, Rio Grande, and Foredom who underwrote its publication - as they should have! With this much advertisement for their products and so little of value in terms of tips and tricks, it should be free.Would I keep it if it cost $7 - $8? Maybe, but as it is, I want my money back. It is simply inconceivable that MIJA Press would think this tiny book would fetch the price they put on it."
3,"Overpriced, Expected MUCH MORE",I agree that this book is way overpriced. However there really isn't anything else out there. I bought this book at the same time my Flex was being delivered. I was disappointed because I could have just figured out what everything was used for....and I am just a beginner. My money would have been spent wiser on other supplies. I would not recommend this purchase until after you have you Flex and play a bit with it. Then if you really can't figure it out...borrow the book. This is not a reference I will keep out in my library. It will just get stuck somewhere and I won't reference it after reading it once.
1,Using the flex shaft,I think this book is priced way to high at $34.95 it should have been around $10.95 most of the information was of the type that comes with a flexshaft or is free on the internet I was very disappointed with the book after reading it.
3,Expensive,"I order this book for my wife to go with her new flexshaft. I could not believe that they charged $30.00 for this booklet.Granted there are not many buyers for this item, but certainly $ 30.00 it is too much.In the positive side,there is good information provided and it is a good intoduction to the use of this tool."
1,Still have not received this item,"The rating above should be ""0"" because:I'm very glad you offer this ""Review"" feature as it has been quite some time since I ordered this item and still have not received it! And I do not have the information about who I ordered it from to follow up. Please help.Thank you..."
4,"Good, Solid System","I don't know what the other guy is talking about, but you can get sound out of all the speakers. I for one think this is a great system -- powerful bass, good sound out of all the speakers. The only thing I don't like is the wiring, you have to connect the blue/white wire to each component separately. I'm not an audiophile, so having all those connections is just setting me up for failure, though I guess I got lucky.Customer support is obviously overseas (outside U.S.), but the guy was friendly, was able to resolve my problem (cable channels over 100 and no sound out of the center channel), and was able to decipher my stupid setup questions quickly.I highly recommend this system."
5,A truly outstanding children's book,"This book has it all -- great facts, appealing layout, detailed and useful illustrations. The writing is superb, taking into account an older child's point of view. It's a significant step up from most similar books for children. It should provide families with hours of enjoyment and learning."
3,Okay but not like the Beer Nuts of olden days,"I remember eating Beer Nuts, as a kid, when my mom and dad had friends come over to play cards. I loved the sweet and salty taste. These almonds have the same flavor but just not very much of it. There is hardly any of the salty/sweet coating on these little babies. They taste OK but not a good as they could..... However, the 1 ounce size package is great for tossing into your purse or briefcase to take along for a healthy snack."
4,excellent!,had them shipped to my office and only got a handful left at the end of the day as people came in for them like on a krispy kreme friday!
5,This is by far the best mahou shoujo anime yet!,"The third volume of Cardcaptor Sakura has some of the best episodes in the Clow Card arc. There's alot of character development in the four episodes on this DVD, and less plot develpment, but IMHO, CCS's strong point is it's wonderful characters. ^_^Enjoy!"
5,Top notch,This book is engaging--not merely words in a list. And the accompanying poetry is fantastic and witty. Espy loves the language and this shows plainly in this great volume.
3,Oddly Organized,"This book is definitely heftier and supplemented with additional material you won't find in other rhyming dictionaries. However, it uses an idiosyncratic notation for vowels. Clement Wood's rhyming dictionary, on the other hand, uses the standard notation you find in dictionaries, and then reminds you of their meaning and order at the bottom of each page, to help you quickly find the right spot for a particular sound.This may sound like nitpicking, but I definitely switched over to Wood's dictionary since, from my experience, the fewer hurdles to getting to the rhyme, the more enjoyable and effective rhyming becomes. It's never bad to have two dictionaries around, however..."
4,Good Book with a few quirks,"I like this book quite a bit. It is packed with useful words however, its organization is a bit quirky and could be much easier to use."
4,I love Amazon.com,I'm very pleased and comfortable with Amazon and have found it pretty easy to get and return items if necessary.
4,nice reminder of home,"I bought this calendar to remind me of New Orleans. I've relocated to Nashville due to Katrina. The pictures give a good general idea of some of the architecture and color around the city. I wish there were more photos that weren't so generic or ""touristy""."
2,"Not in ""excellent"" condition","The books cover is torn around all the edges. The book is signed by Eric Carle, but there is something written on the front inside cover that is by someone else...Very frustrated. Also the cover was covered in dirt smudges."
5,Wonderful book for young and old,"This is one of my favorite books to read to my daughter at night, and it is one of her faves as well. The art and prose are beautiful, and whether or not the child understands all of the words is beside the point. It is great for getting the little one to slow down her engine and appreciate those who may not move at the same speed. Drawing on the biblical standpoint of sloth as one of the deadly sins, the other creatures ridicule the sloth for being so lazy. Here Carle gets us to appreciate the great virtue of being, well, ""slothful."" In this fast-moving and chaotic world (which greatly affects our kids whether we care to admit it or not)the sloth can teach us a lot through his contemplative and deliberate philosophy of life. I strongly recommend this book."
5,"Great book, great life lesson!","I ordered this book for my best friend, and her baby on the way. I love the story and the lesson it teaches little ones. :)"
5,wonderful book,"my son is 20 months and we borrowed this book from the library, along with 10 others... this book is consistently his first choice. He loves all the animals and can say all the animal names and identify them in the back. It is great how all the animals' names are listed below their picture on the last two pages. I am now ordering him his own copy!"
3,Plain,"Though soft if taken care of, and desirable to a collecter, there isn't really anything unique about him. Ty Beanie Babies get better every year, and in the year 2005, you're bound to find better-made, more colorfully decorated Beanies then this one. Gray really is a dull color, but if you love rhinos, I suppose you'd like him."
1,Hard to use,"This box sounds like a great Idea and the lights, tri-pods and case are very nice, but the actual ""tent"" is too hard to deal with. It is made with very thin wire that is hard to twist without damaging so that the box cannot be returned to the tiny case it is supposed to be stored in, so there is nothing portible about the box. The company was no help. When I complained that I could not get the box back into the case, they sent me instructions on how to set the box up. When I finally asked to return the product, which in all fairness, was after 30 days, I never even received a reply. I will not deal with Adorama Camera again."
2,No Mat,The product does not come with the any mat. We found much cheaper version with 3 mats on ebay. So I returned this.
4,Great Buy,Easy to get up and going. We run a floral business and it allows us to take great pics for the website! Worth every penny!
3,Error literature,I used this book as part of a literature review on errors from a cognitive aspect. This book was very useful as it provides a comprehensive review of experimental errors by several researchers.
1,REAL DEAL MYSTIC FOREST,I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MYSTIC FOREST CD BECAUSE THERE IS BACKGROUND MUSIC AND NOISE THAT IS SO DISTRACTING. I TRIED TO TURN OFF THE SOUND BUT THE PROMTS DON'T WORK. I LIKE TO HEAR THE SOUNDS OF THE SLOT MACHINE NOT AMBIENT MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.
1,BAD,DO NOT ORDER THIS ONE. DOES NOT LOAD PROPERLY ON XP OR WINDOWS 7. AMAZON DID NOT EVEN RESPOND WHEN I TOLD THEM IT DID NOT WORK. SAVE YOUR MONEY ORDER SOMETHING ELSE.
2,Inferior game compared to previous Phantom EFX slots,"If you own other Phantom EFX slot games such as Bonus Mania or Nickels & More, Mystic Forest may be a disappointment. Technically, installation is a problem with obvious glitches in the system. Most games are simplistic, lacking challenge and interest. Not all games have bonus rounds, and few have various levels to work your way thru in those rounds. For those who like to play stand alone offline slot games, this is not one of Phantom's better efforts--the co. seems more focused now on creating online subscriber ""full casino"" services."
5,The best keeps getting better!,"If you like slots, this is the game for you. Not only does it have phenomenal graphics and animations, but there are add-on slots you can purchase, and slots you can win in the prize vault.And if you like online multiplayer, there are tournaments on virtually every slot, Guilds you can join, earn a suite, furnish your suite by buying things in the mall. Not to mention the challenges you can complete to increase your pays!A combination of casino and first person role playing games....this one has it ALL."
5,Mystic Forest- PHANTOMEFX,"This game is an incredible addition to Phantomefx's Online casino. Its interactive experience is something that no other game offers, becoming an online member is a great way to play the slots, card games and meet new friends. I literally have spent hundreds of hours enjoying the newest addition to this ongoing game. You never get bored with all the challenges, tournaments and new experiences you can get. Definately worth the money!"
5,Epyon is finally here!!!,"It's about time. In this set of three episodes the Gundam Epyon is finally revealed. Also, Duo reappears in this episode, as well as Zechs with the Tallgeese. Heero and Relena have fairly big parts in these episodes, and the plot sets up for important things to come. So, if you have been a fan of the series, this video is a must have."
2,Not a bad read. But unlikely to yield added happiness.,"What's particularly ironic about this book is that, in order to be enjoyed, it requires a ""check your brains at the door"" (or maybe the cover?) approach to reading it--and yet that strategy runs directly counter to its title, which implies that it will teach you to use your mind, proactively, to find happiness. That, it won't do.The passages that make you feel good aren't about thinking, and the passages that are (or purport to be) about thinking in a true, cognitive sense aren't actionable; like much of the rest of self-help, they don't reduce to actual tactics that can be translated into a life plan.It'll give you a few ephemeral warm-fuzzy moments (in the same vein as, say, the Chicken Soup books) and it sometimes sounds a little bit like a more secular rendering of Joel Osteen. But if you really DO do what the authors urge--i.e., THINK--you'll find very little here that you haven't heard before. Often."
4,Attitude is Everything,"Looking for a magic bullet to make you happy? Of course, you know there's no such thing. In the end, happiness all comes down to the choices you make each day.And you can CHOOSE to be happy. You're thinking, ""Yeah, sure, just CHOOSE happiness. I've tried that and it's never worked for me!"" Try again, but this time, use the guidelines in this book.There are 8 guidelines (or ""secrets"") offered by the author. To me, two of them were the most important, and probably all you need. They are:--Don't try to be anyone but yourself.--NOW is the time to be happy (not ""when I have no debt"", ""when I lose weight"", etc.)If you follow these and the other guidelines, you'll come away from reading ready to live a life without regrets, one that is focused on the beauty of each moment in your life."
1,so not convincing,The title of this book made it sound really promising. But I didn't think the book was convicing - just a lot of platitudes. The only good nuggets of info:Don't compare yourself to others. You are just where you are supposed to be. Don't waste time envying people whom you would not want to be. It gets better. The passage of time enhances your life.
5,Sometimes the answers are right there in front of you!!!!,"A friend and colleague gave me this book after I noticed him to be in a better and more efficient frame of mind at work. I read the book this weekend and have already implemented the strategy at work and home. This book is clear and concise and, yes, important to find your place in the world."
4,Pulse-pounding action,"Great action combined with great sound equals a great game. This game is a very complex shooter. The controls may be difficult to begin with, but with a little bit of time and the in game training the scenarios supply you with, they become rather intuitive pretty quickly. Played with the dual shock controller, this game is great. It really takes advantage of both of the sticks and makes flying very easy. Movement is so easy that the hardest part of this game is flying straight.G-Police provides you with various vehicles and weapons that are used throughout the game. The storyline is decent and the graphics are pretty good. Some scenarios are very difficult and the loading times are very long. This is a good, low-price game."
4,This is the best book if you need help with Super Mario RPG!,This is the best guide for you if you need help with Super Mario RPG! Even if you don't need help it tells where all the secrets are so it's cool to have anyway. If you LOVE Mario RPG or just like to play it then get this book!!!!
1,Poorly written,"I wanted to like this book because:a. I'm a lesbianb. I'm blackc. I'm a TrinidadianHow disappointing! I could relate to some of the characters because of similar experiences but the typos (polite way of saying GROSS SPELLING ERRORS) made this book tedious and sometimes confusing to read. It was laughable that the author struggles with the context of the words effect/affect, to/too and forth/fourth.Borrow this book from a library if you can. It is totally a waste of money!"
4,Where is the sequel?,I for one love this book. I ordered this book from my personal reccomended items. At first I was a little hesitant about purchasing the item because of the cover. The excerpt is what made me buy it.It's like reading an lesbian soap opera. I love this book. To me I felt as though it was a true page turner.Plus I love the definitons at the end of the book. I am waiting for the sequel.
2,The Art of Putting: The revolutionary feel-based system for Improving your score,"This title of this book is mis-leading to the max. It is boring, and contains much ""filler"" and does not get to the point. It contains ""fundamentals"" of putting to be found in any beginner's putting book, sort of a collection of everything written about putting in golf magazines. There is nothing revolutionary about any of it, much less a ""feel-based system"". Money could be best spent elswhere, in my opinion."
4,This book will help your putting....,"I recently purchased this book as way to help improve my dreadful putting. I found this book was easy to follow and the drils it suggested do work esp the coin one. The price is a little step for a short book, but it is a hardcover. But bottom line is this will help sink more putts."
2,Putt like Stan Utley,The Art of Putting is not like the Art of War. Stan is only content to convey his style of putting with his mechanics and his mannerisms. The same can be said about Pelz. I have read both and I can say that both apply. I putted like Stan for almost 20 years (right handed). I have spent the last 2 years working on a Pelz stroke (left handed). Yes the title is misleading as is the Pelz title (since Dave does not cover the stroke that Stan covers). You need to understand your own putting style and then read the material pertinent to yourself. I was looking for more insight into putting (The Art) and it was not in this book.
4,Helpful Guide,"I am rereading this book and it makes sense on a lot of levels. Have not been on the greens yet, but have practiced indoors. Very simple but effective ideas and photos help a lot too. Would obviously like to get a lesson with Stan in person, but this is a good substitute. Now it's time to practice what he preaches and incorporate into my putting game. Would recommend this book to anyone who has struggled with their putting."
5,Used books,"I had been looking for this book for a long time, at a price I could afford. Thanks to the second-hand bookseller, I could finally afford it! Plus, it came so much faster than expected."
1,Truly horrible,"The main flaw with this story--and it's a big one-- is that the plot, fundamentally, is impossible. Bear with me.Azazel is trapped in a dimension other than the 616 universe. So he goes to the 616 universe, mates with human women, goes back to his dimension, bides his time, and finally brings them all to his dimension using some convoluted teleportation spell.And therein lies the gaping plot hole. If he can't leave the dimension, then his plan to get back to Earth can't involve travelling to Earth or the whole thing is unnecessary.And even worse is the dialogue.And even worse is Philip Tan's bizarre fusion of realism and manga. Watch him deform nearly everybody. Really, this guy draws like a twelve-year old.Worst of all, this one has lasting effects on the X-books."
1,there is a reason two major comic companies fired him,"..really horrible writing, the only reason his x-men is traded, is because the x-men movies helped the book sales surge, they traded anything with an X on it, good bad or just plain ugly like this.what can you expect from a book with a plot hole where the villain is trapped, and to get free leaves his prison, has babies with women and returns to wait for the babies to free him..can you spot the problem? well anyone could, but the wirter can not.the characters act nothing like they should, austen loves to write characters as jerks, people who fly off the handle for no reason, he admits that he can't wait or build up to moments, he just writes them in, if he likes the idea of an angry character 99 percent of the time he will not give a reason, he just does it, he can't wait, well for most people the journey is the joy, how chgaracter A turns into character B, how a good hearted man turns heard, or a hard tuff as nails man finds his soft side."
3,It's great to renew the familiarity of games from the past!,This is perfect for people who can't keep up with the hightech graphics and games of today. It's been great being able to go back to my childhood by playing these classic games that started my arcade fanatic life!
5,"If you owned an Intellivision, buy this now.","This is a great game, brings back great memories of my childhood with an Intellivision. Has 30 games some are classics like: Snafu, Night Stalker, Astrosmash (my personal favorite), and Sub Hunt. The only drawback would be the load times on everything. It loads each menu at a time, but well worth the wait. This game will bring back some good memories of old technology on newer technology."
3,Operation 6,"I have no complains, product meets my expectations, service was great & timely. Keep the good work!!!"
5,This Book is An Excellent Choice!!!,"I have spent hours in book stores looking for the perfect book to teach myself C++, and I have finally found it!!! I feel that this book was well worth the money. I had no previous expierence with teh language, but I was able to learn quickly with this book. Tony Gaddis explains everything very well. The examples are explained in full detail. If you are learning C++ on your own, or studying it in school, this book is an excellent choice!!!"
3,it's okay,"My only complaint is that it's awkwardly long. Doesn't fit in any of my bags. I live in Seattle, should probly get a compact travel umbrella and this is not it.Update! This unbrella broke the second time I used it =("
4,Umbrella,Good value for the price. It is an easy automatic umbrella fits in my car and easy to carry. Dries quickly
1,Not automatically close and damage,"This product is long and it cannot cover two people. The umbrella is automatically open, but not close. The umbrella was damaged when I receive it."
2,Cheap,Cheap both price wise and quality wise. It is super light and feels like it might break any moment even in the slightest of winds. The handle is not even rigid enough.
1,Junk,"this lasted about 5 minutes in moderate wind, comparable to $3 junk you buy on the street not recommended at all"
3,50% success rate,"I ordered two of these. One for my wife and one for myself. One of them came and the button did not function at all, so that one got returned. The other one worked ok. It's a smallish cover, but it does the job. I guess you get what you pay for. I used to have an umbrella that would open and close with a button push. This only opens with a button push. Not bad, and it's held up to some wind and rain so far."
5,Great umbrella!,These umbrellas are very sturdy. We bought them for a corporate function. The colors are great. It was a nice branding addition!
1,Garbage,"Title is misleading-it is auto open, manual folding (close) and it will not stay closed.Cheap, not well made at all, total waste of money."
2,Flimsy and small.,Not for commuters but OK for a short walk from your car in the parking lot to where ever you are going.
2,Not the best,"It is technically auto open (ie there's a button to open it) but it's seriously so hard to push the button that it'd probably be faster to just manually open it. Also, as someone else said, it's too big when closed (it's really long, for some reason), and too small when open. It's been moderately sturdy."
2,DISAPPOINTED,The pictures shows an umbrella that has both black and red sections. My grandaughters school colors are black and red. The umbrella they sent is all black with ONE red section. Boring and not what I expected.
1,Rainkist umbrella,"This is a very fragile product. The aluminum struts are too thin and do not have a shape that gives strength. The holes for clips also promote weakness. The clips fall out easily. The springs are good quality. I know this because the umbrella quickly fell apart. The umbrella unflips in the wind easily. Why make a product that does not have durability? ""Made in China"" has a bad reputation."
4,Good umbrella,This umbrella was a little bigger than I thought. It is made well and it opens and closes easily. To open push the button on the handle. It pops open very quickly.
1,Waste of money,"This umbrella is just a waste of money.Please do not buy this.By the use of third time it is almost gone.It cannot stand even a light wind.This is two folding umbrella,so it is vey inconvenient to carry."
5,Excelente articulo!,"Esta sombrilla es un regalo para mi esposa! Lo que mas me gusta, es un articulo 100% Original y Económico! Se lo recomiendo a todos mis contactos!"
4,easy to use,"i am basically new at wearing gp lenses so my dr's assist. told me to get one of these and use it because i was having trouble getting them out the usual way (pulling of the eye lid sideways/blinking)and it works great,,smaller than what i thought it would be but overall a great product for rgp lens wearers to have on hand"
3,I ordered wrong product. Needed one for soft lenses,I ordered wrong product needed one for soft lenses. It behooves a person to read thoroughly before ordering a product
1,RGP Insterter/Remover,I purchased contact lens inserter/remover from this company. When I received this item I opened the box to read the instructions and it read do not use with soft lenes. I contacted the company and as asked if I could exchange for the soft lens tool they refused. I mentioned I did not open the contents and they said they would not exchange or refund my money. This is very poor customer service. I reccommend not to shop at this company.
4,No More Scars,"This product makes removing hard contact lenses from your eyes very easy. No more scratched eyes from the lenses moving which means no more pain, no more dropped and/or lost lenses as the RGP fimly holds on to the lens until you safely remove it. I do not need to use it for insertion but I'm sure it works just as well as removal. Top notch product and I wish I had heard about it sooner."
4,kind of over-priced for a piece of soft plastic,Does the job as advertised for those of us that wear contacts but can't pop them out easily. Pricey for what it is. The little plastic case is nice.
2,Too much suction if it gets off the contac.,"I couldn't get it to stick to the contac to get it out, but it stuck to my eye and I was afraid it was going to damage the outer lining of my eye. I was frustrated, our eyes are very precious and can't be replaced. It really put suction on my eye. I didn't see any directions. Mabe I didn't use it properly. Any Ideas anyone?? Dee"
2,Vinnie's Secret to Shreading,"The Vinnie Vincent Technique1) record a guitar solo on tape2) speed the tape up on play back3) instantly you are ""playing fast""Ever notice how Vinnie never played fast in KISS, but was suddenly a shreader as a solo artist? Ever see the sheet music for his so called solos? No one can play series of 64th notes like that. Gimmie a break."
2,Unfortunately there is nothing else!,"I am new to PHP and templating technology. I have used ASP.NET and ASP, but have started doing some work with LAMP, so I figured I would try to make my work easier with Smarty.I did a quick search for Smarty here on Amazon and could only find one book on Smarty, so I bought it, the E version anyway. After reading a few pages I found that I could not stand the way the author writes.I have read quite a bit of technical books, this definately rates among the worst I have read. The author fails to make his subject interesting. I understand this is not a novel, but still, I believe that technical writers, above all, need to make the subject interesting."
4,Great guide to PHP & Smarty,"If you're looking for a good book on Smarty, this one should definitely be on your list. This book takes you through every feature that Smarty offers in an easy-to-understand and practical way, with plenty of clear and concise examples to make it even easier to understand.It doesn't matter if you're a developer who wants to start using Smarty or if you're a designer who has to start working with Smarty, this book is a great resource for both and thanks to a clear division in the book it's easy to learn about Smarty as a developer or designer.There aren't many negative things to say about this book, but it isn't perfect either. Sometimes things are explained multiple times, with might cause some slight annoyance, and in some cases parts of an example aren't explained at all, which leaves you wondering what something is used for.To sum it all up, this book is certainly worth the money, and I can definitely recommend it if you're looking to get started with Smarty."
5,Amazing Smarty book,"No need to hide it, ""Smarty PHP Template Programming and Application"" is an excellent book!Whether you are graphic designer or developer, this book is for you, thanks to a clear separation of the needs.Every step is exposed in details : installation, utility and the way to work with Smarty is clearly explained.You can add to this a detailed explanation of the various built-in variables and methods, differents way for managing the cache, filters and plugins,... all this makes this book a very good one, covering from he most basic to the most advanced methods.Moreover, there's a complete chapter on ""website internationalization"" with Smarty.To summarize, and I guess you already understood, this is an excellent book that any developer/designer who works with Smarty must read."
3,"1,000 White Women","I enjoyed this book...especially being from an American Indian heritage. It amazes me how in tune with nature the Indian Nations were....way before it was popular to be ""Green"". I believe they had it RIGHT. I am having a hard time believing that this could be true...but things were not so out in the open then....could be."
4,A Spirited Read,"As I began reading the fictional journal of Mary Dodd I found myself wondering if it could possibly be true. Maybe there were women eager to escape a condition who would have signed up for such an adventure! Mary was a remarkable women and I know that her children would have been proud of her as she learned a new life that was surely better than being in an institution! Ironically the August edition of National Geographic arrived the day I finished the book. The ""In the Spirit of Crazy Horse "" article made the book come even more alive! I hope that a movie will be made for I think it could be great!"
4,What a pleasant surprise!,"The title and jacket description did not inspire me. The book was recommended by a trusted friend, so I gave it a shot and I was glad I did. This book was based on a factual offer from a Cheyenne chief to Pres. Grant, a great premise to start with and the author took it to great places; a nice read! Give it a chance!"
3,Take It With a Barrel of Salt,"I found this to be a somewhat entertaining read. This is the type of book which is perfect for a book club - it isn't very deep or hard to read, may serve as an infrequent reader's introduction to the subject, but leads more serious readers to other books on the subject. (For example John G. Bourke was a real historical figure and his many books and diaries are available, includingOn the Border with Crook).That being said.... the characters were clichéd, the plot was predictable, and at NO time did I believe this was written by a woman of the period. Snark Alert! May was the worst kind of Mary Sue (Google it). Now I remember why I couldn't remember anything about this book - I first read it not long after it was published in the 1990s.For a much better fictional romp through the Cheyenne Nation, readLittle Big Man... or watch the movieLittle Big Man."
1,Inaccurate from the get-go,"On page 7, we read that in the 1874 White House, ""old daguerrotype photographs"" were taken... A daguerrotype is not a photograph, and by 1874, hardly anyone was using such outdated technology, surely not at the White House. That would be like finding a mimeograph at the 2009 White House. This error would have been easy for the author, or the editors, if there were any, to correct... so I wondered immediately, what else did he get wrong? Lots and lots... and I second the comments of other reviewers that this ""novel"" is loaded with cardboard figures, outdated stereotypes, and so forth, to the point that the writing quickly turned into self-parody. But it's good for a laugh, if you're stuck on a plane with nothing else to read."
1,Predicatble...full of stereotypical characters,"This was our book club book and I really struggled using precious time to get through it. However, most of the other ladies in the club really liked it. I felt like the author used the thesaurus to insert words to impress. Too many, ""I said, she said, he said, etc."" The story seemed contrived. When a man writes from a woman's perspective, there is an emotional gap. When May infrequently mentions her children to state how much she misses and loves them, the true despair a mother would feel does not come through."
2,"Loved the concept, hated the story....","I really wanted to like this book; excellent premise. However, this is supposed to be a journal (it's not) even with fiction plugged in... the inconsistency just drove me absolutely NUTS (no pun intended if you've read the book)... in one part, May writes a letter to her daughter detailing her sexual exploits. Yet a few chapters later she's all shy and bothered about the same topic... I would think it would have seemed inappropriate to write to her daughter about this than a journal entry to herself!"
2,"Unsatisfying characters, interesting premise","Although the premise of this book is creative and the writing style is polished, the characters and story left plenty to be desired. Good things happen, bad things happen, but the characters don't seem to develop or grow.It's like watching a mediocre sitcom: the same characters put in different situations, but nothing ever really changes or develops. Each one has their ""issue"" that they came into the story with, and we see that ""issue"" as the background for everything that person does.Often the friendships between the women are spoken of, yet I don't see anything that convinces me of any real bond between anyone here. The closest bond I see is a few fearful characters who look to follow May Dodd's lead.Read the first 100 pages, and then move on."
2,Awkwardly written,"Thie writing seemed very contrived. The journal/letter style communication seemed in authentic. Additionally, the nature of the ending made it awkward. I wish it was just written in third person."
1,Don't bother,"My book club read this book a few months ago. We were all very disappointed. The premise is wonderful and could have been a basis for an excellent story meshing two cultures. Ultimately it is a poorly written below avergae romance type book with a lead character who is manipulated to fit an unbelievable story line. The author often finds himself in a position where he ""needs"" an item (ie- a towel), has the heroine pull one out of her teepee and then explains she happened to bring one with her years before. Very disappointing."
1,"get real, Jim","I was very, very disappointed in this book. I found it trite, contrived, and in general demeaning to all women, all nationalities, and to the members of the clergy who were mentioned. The characters were so stereotyped that they were not believable. May Dodd herself was just not believable; the handsome captain fell in love with her, lo and behold, the CHIEF also picked her, what a coincidence! No woman of that era and of her upbringing would have been so open about sexual matters regardless of her ""renegade"" nature. Here are examples of the contrived nature of the text: a ""black"" Indian for the ""black"" woman, twins for the twins, a big dumb Indian for poor ""ugly"" Gretchen (not an attractive representation of Swiss or Germans), and let's not forget the ""Nancy boys"" how could you have a novel without mentioning homosexuality as well? Don't waste your time."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book because I love a good historical novel, and the premise of this one sounded intriguing. I've never read a Harlequin romance, but this book is what I imagine is just a notch above one of those. May seemed like a cardboard character, her comrade brides absurd caricatures of a Southern belle, Irish twins, a tomboy mule skinner, a religious nut, an Amazonian African American, and a Swiss milkmaid -- each just as unappealing as Rene Zelwegger's exaggerated hillbilly in the film, Cold Mountain. I lacked any sense of what May's Cheyenne chief -- or, for that matter, any of the Indians -- was all about, although the rationale for this could be that the story was told from May's perspective and she couldn't speak the Cheyenne language. Maybe it would have been better to have had her the character be the one who learned the language easily, in order to get more of the Cheyennes' viewpoint."
2,Too 1 dimensional,"I was looking foward to reading this, but was sorely dissapointed. My main gripe is simply that the characters are flat, inconsistent and unrealistic. The ending was a dissapointment. I felt no real emotion, and no liking for the main character. I flipped through this book in 2 days, skipping many pages because the story was slow. Detail about emotions, relationships, etc. would have been great, but this was, after, written by a man. Pick up something like Follow the River instead."
1,Get real,"I read this for my book club and am glad I got it from the library instead of wasting my money buying it. It was on a level with a beach romance, unbelievable characters behaving in unbelievable ways in a yawner of a book. I am amazed some readers liked it."
1,Preposterous Premise,Book club selection was assigned. I was skeptical about the premise of this book from the start. The female characters were predictable stereotypes based on 21st century values and judgements. Read like a bad Hollywood movie.Truly tedious.
3,"Very readable, however full of cliched characters and situations.","The book was definitely a page-turner, but more along the lines of a well-written romance novel than anything else. The characters were all cliches, from the plucky, intelligent, young and beautiful heroine (May Dodd) to the Indian chief full of integrity and quiet strength (who naturally picked May to be his bride). The heroine always gets the best guy in the story! It was hard to tell fact from fiction, but in the end it didn't really matter. This is a great book to read at the beach, but doesn't have much more literary value that that."
5,Take the leap,"The characters in this book were so real, I felt I was with them on their amazing journey. What a wonderful depiction of the meeting and blending of two cultures, from each woman's decision to dare the unknown to the discoveries, wonder and learning that happened between the women and the Cheyenne every day. Of course, the blending and learning and delight in learning of the ""other"" can only happen on a personal level. The wider culture never seems to be able to accept and honor other ways of living. May and Captain John Bourke tried to bridge that gulf. Jim Fergus's description of their struggle alone makes the book worth reading.I highly recommend this book."
2,Stereotypes Abound,"This book served as a distraction on a long and bumpy plane flight, but otherwise I probably wouldn't have gotten much past Mary Dodd's train journey ""out West."" How much harder this book would have been to write had our heroine's small group not included such a fine array of the ethnic stereotypes that have succored the authors of potboilers down the years: the faded Southern Belle complete with lapdog (that her Cheyenne mate, amazingly, presumably feeds and shelters), the lumpy and warm-hearted Germanic (Austrian) madchen, the regal black woman, the felonious Irish twins, the mannish British woman... Oh, and the almost impenetrable ""accents""... surely they wouldn't have been necessary had there been any meaningful characterization. I'm sorry: this is just not a good book. But, Mr. Fergus, you're probably not a bad writer when you write about what you know -- which certainly doesn't include women of any era, much less of the nineteenth century."
4,Inspirational journals,"The reviews might be mixed, but I loved this book. I borrowed it from the library and actually went out and bought my own copy before I even finished reading it. I was particularly impressed that a man was able to write the journals entirely from a woman's perspective and be so convincing. I was awed by May's strength, leadership and positive attitude during such a frightening and unexplored experience. Despite her tragic past and tragic demise, she lived a beautiful, respectful and loving existence among ""the savages."" I found her to be very inspirational.As I live among a very high population of Native Americans and within miles of a major reservation, I find myself having newfound respect for the trials and tribulations the Native American people faced in the 1800s (and still today). Their lifestyle was not ""savage,"" but beautiful and natural. It was how the white settlers treated them that was the tragic savageness of the story."
4,Great book once you get into it!,"This is a great book. I thought it was going to be all about the American Revolution, boring. But, it turned out to be inspiring and well written. It is a great book for women to read. Makes you cherish what you have."
5,Love historical fiction!,"I read this book a few years ago. It still stands as one of my favorite books of all time. Anytime I can still remember a book and its plot after a few weeks, it is worthy of a review, it must be memorable. I have to say, you do believe you are there and it could have actually happened. An excellent read!"
5,A great read,"This a great book, what a wonderful story, it has it all; history, love, family, betrayal, hope, mystery and friendship. A fast read- you will not want to put it down."
5,A true gift,"When I am asked to suggest a book to someone, it is a pleasure to give them this beautiful story. This has become my gift to all of my siblings, friends, nieces, and work mates! Fergus has a rare jewel with this novel. I finished the book in two days and a week later found myself missing the characters! I need to read it again, I guess! Bravo, Mr. Fergus, and definately ENCORE!"
5,Engrossing read,"I loved this book! At the very beginning I was a bit skeptical but once I got into it I couldn't stop listening. I read some other reviews that mentioned finding men writing in a woman's voice not believable but I disagree. An author is a story teller and can tell a story from many perspectives, you need to use your imagination... it's fiction! After only a little way into the book I was immersed in the time, place and beauty of the setting. I loved the characters, a lot of variety and different peronalities. The Native American way of life was quite interesting and although this book was written in a plain spoken way it really came alive for me. I would highly suggest this book to anyone. It's an easy read and I think a ""page turner."""
5,Interesting look at our past--womans point of view!!,If you like History and ever wished you were a pioneer this is really worth a read. Love it. Think I'm glad I came later.
4,Women in the West,"I enjoyed reading the book, learning about the hardships of women living in the West. Glad I did not live during that time period."
2,Did not love,"Love historical fiction, but much of this was unbelievable, or just wrong. I thought the characters were shallow & could of had much more depth."
5,"Captivating, emotional, surreal and engaging","As a pure, historical fiction buff, I can't tell you how magical this novel was. In my years, many years, of reading, I can honestly say that so few books have brought me to tears as ""1000 White Women"" did. Nothing less than sensational will do for the description of this book. It grabbed from the first page, and held on to me through out the entire story. Ten stars would be a better rating for this one. Anyone not captivated by the plot and characters in this story, simply does not think on an emotional and historical level."
3,"Good story, if you can get past the ""unreal"" parts","While reading this book, one must get past the idea of knowing that much of these things would never happen. I have a hard time believing not only that the US would offer ""1000 white women"" but even that the Native Americans would treat them as part of their tribes and allow them to act in ways unheard of by their culture. There are twin Natives to match twin ""white women"" and a black native to match a black bride... this just seems too coincidental.That said, the actual story is quite interesting and of course a novel concept. May Dodd is a thoughtful character, though I think most of the time Fergus has her reporting ""happenings"" in her journals, rather than revealing deep and developed characters.It is certainly not a novel to get engrossed in, however it is quite good and I would recommend it for light reading."
4,"Flawed, perhaps, but riveting nonetheless...","I ended up reading this book in under 24 hours. Having recently taken a correspondence course in Indian Studies, I found that much of Fergus' research on the Plains Indians' cultures was accurate. Though, yes, perhaps many of the characters leaned towards being stereotypes, the ""what-if"" premise of this novel drew me in hook, line, and sinker. I was riveted throughout and would, overall, recommend this novel to those looking for an account of historical FICTION that will draw you in to the desperate, time-bomb world of 1870s Native cultures."
2,So much potential undelivered.,"I was excited about this book at first glance - I love that period of history and the premise was so promising. I really wanted to like it! But the author's use of so many ridiculous stereotypes really bothered me - surely he's intelligent enough to know better. This would've been a much better book if he had dared to make these women real, instead of shallow, one-dimensional paper dolls."
1,Not historical fiction,"Unbelievable, absurd, racist. Anyone can have a book published. For this to be historical fiction there would have to be some truth in it, however, there is none. This book is an insult to the reader. Sadly, some will be convinced that this ridiculous depiction existed. Waste of money."
3,A fun concept,"This was a great idea for a story line. What if. . . while some of it was quite predictable, I was very interested in learning what was going to happen and found the book interesting and entertaining. I would definitely recommend it."
1,"Meet May Dodd, an American Girl by Harlequin Romances!","This book, which had such an interesting premise, could be one of the most poorly executed books I have ever read! It is written at about a fifth grade level, but is not appropriate for a fifth grader due to the author's obsession with erections, mass rapes, and bodice-ripping sex! There is also blatant gender and racial stereotyping-embarrassingly so! There has got to be far superior historical fiction out there dealing with the plight of Native Americans -do your research and skip this one at all costs!"
3,good outweighs the bad,"I put this down quickly the first time I wanted to read it. The characters seemed Romance Novely and very type cast...not my style. I like a more realistic, even edgy story. I picked it up again for a book club and knowing what to expect, I was able to get past that. A supposed big surprise at the end was pretty transparent to me and there were what I felt to be major flaws in certain parts of the story line. That said, the writing is engaging, and the historic and cultural aspects are fascinating."
2,One Thousand White Women: The Journals of May Dodd,"Prior to ordering this, I read in a newspaper book review, that it was an actual journal (true story) written by May Dodd. So, I ordered it from Amazon and it was promptly delivered. However, I was so disappointed to learn in the introduction, that the book is fiction. I'm struggling to finish it as it now seems totally corny."
2,Predictable,"I really wanted to like this book. I work in a bookstore, and when a customer asked after this book, I had to check it out myself. Ultimately, I was disappointed. The storyline is somewhat cliche - think classic Indian romance novel - mixed with terrible character development and a predictable plot. Normally I encourage people to read books for themselves and form their own opinions, but on this one, I wouldn't waste your time. Reading the title and description will allow your imagination to come up with a much more interesting story than what the author provided between the pages."
4,1000 White Women,"A very different premise that held my interest, was written so you could picture the people and places in your imagination, and made you think about the real things the Indians, calvery, and frontier people did to each other. Both sides had their faults and I'm not sure the Indians are that well off in our society today."
2,Good beach reading but NOT REALISTIC!,It was an entertaining read but hardly great fiction and far from realistic. I felt like this was more in line of pulp fiction than literary fiction -- enjoyable but not memorable.
5,Great Storytelling!,"This book has been read and passed around a large group of friends, and everyone has loved it--most of the friends are Native Americans. It is fanciful, but not unbelievable, and the attitudes of the characters in the book are not out of line with true historical characters we can read about. As a student of Native American history, ancient to contemporary, I found this book highly entertaining, with scenes to laugh about and to cry about; that's what good literature is all about. Sure, one could fault Jim Fergus about some of his points of view and about the vehicle he uses to portray May Dodd, but so what? Shakespeare and Dickens have used vehicles that were just as ""suspect."" Forget being a realist, let go, and you'll find that this book is true, refreshing literature. I'd love to see this made into a movie!"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on.,"The extremely interesting premise made me want to read this book, but I should have headed the advice of some of the female readers below. The writing is so stilted and forced that it entirely distracts from everything going on in the book. It is extremely clear that a man in 1999 is writing as May, a women in 1875. The pretentious writing and poorly developed characters, who lack any sort of realism, make ths book unbearable. I can't speak to the plot because I only got through four chapters before I gave up (the first time I have ever not finished a fiction book). I have no idea how this writer ever got a book deal. Please don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,Bodice-ripper novel-lovers rejoice!,"How did the publisher miss getting Fabio to pose for the book jacket? This novel is purple in prose and preposterous in plot. And if that weren't enough, it's peppered with howler anachronisms. Would an American woman in the 1870s really use the word ""sadistic?"" True, she's quite adventurous, but Freud wasn't publishing yet and it's very unlikely she could have gotten her hands on de Sade.Don't waste your time on this stinker."
1,Save your money,"The writing was banal at best. It is fierce irony that such a mediocre writer would quote Shakespeare. The characters were shallow, ill conceived and predictable. An example of the down side to book clubs. One star because ZERO was not an option."
2,Characters were a little off,"Although this book grabbed my attention initially, it slowed down about half way through and I had a hard time getting through it. The characters in this book just seemed ""off."" There are so many things that the female characters in this book do and say that just seems so unrealistic. The women in this book embrace the Cheyenne culture, lifestyle and their new husbands so immediately without any longing for their past lives, modern civilization, or any thought to when the bride experiment will be over. The women who are kidnapped and raped in the book seem to get over the experience like a chest cold. As a woman myself, I can't imagine myself in situations like these women are and being as nonchalant about it. Because the author's depiction of women in this book is so inaccurate, it makes me wonder how realistically he portrayed the Cheyenne as well. This book has an interesting premise it just could have been so much better than it was."
3,White Brides for Cheyenne Indians,"I was drawn to this book because of its title. It sounded fascinating. While the idea for the story was intriguing, the execution to me, was just average. It wasn't a bad book at all. It is just that the characters and the story were predictable. I found myself skip-reading (a bad sign) over some of the lengthy descriptions of the mountainside and other things."
3,"The first 2/3rds of this book were great, but then...","I couldn't put this book own when I got it. It's wonderful, exciting and adventurous. However, the last 1/3 of the book was dragging, and dragging and oh yes draggin. Over all it was a great story with lots of good historical information. Make you think though. What things were like then in comparison to today."
5,One of my favorite books!,"I am hoping that this book has found a good home because I have lent it out to so many people that I no longer know where it is and I'm going to have to reorder. Love the story, love the historical background. If you enjoy historical fiction, this is a must read."
3,Entertaining,"1000 White Women is an entertaining read. Some is a little unbelievable, but for entertainment value, it's great. I do believe it shows how simple the Cheyenne Indians' lifestyle was, living off the land, moving with the buffalo herds, and how terrible things must have been for them and other Indian tribes towards the middle of the 1800's when white settlers started moving into the areas that had been clearly given to them under various U.S. treaties. I felt it also showed womens ability to adapt and survive in trying situations."
1,Inane book made worse by Kindle typos,"In addition to being an incredibly sophomoric and inane book, the Kindle version is replete with annoying typographic errors, making it irritating and nearly impossible to read. Somehow a lot of s's have been replaced with d's. See, for example the poem at the start of Notebook IV, The Devil Whiskey. ""jumble of bodies"" has become ""jumble of bodied"", ""some"" has become ""dome"", ""couples"" has become ""coupled"" and these are just a few lines of the poem. There are many other examples of the substitution of d for s, but it is particularly egregious here.In another error, what should be the contraction 'll has come out as 1 1 instead with no punctuation.If I were into conspiracy theories, I would say that the publishers were trying to kill e-books by selling books with so many errors. I can't imagine that the print version contained all of these typos.This is the third Kindle book I have purchased that is loaded with typos."
1,Not Worth the time,I just finished reading this book and only did finish because I was on vacation and did not have another thing to read. I am an historical fiction lover but this was just too bizare for me...I give the author credit for his imagination but the story just did not work for me. It was boring and far too much time was spent on where they went to the bathroom. Interesting characters I guess but just too weird.
3,One Thousand White Women,I enjoyed reading the book. I found it be interesting with regard to the customs and relationships of that period of time. I would recommend it to others.
4,Fascinating.....,"I found this book to be a quick but fascinating read. I loved the premise of the book, and the writing in fantastic. You get great descriptions of each unique individual, and you come to care about them. I think this book capture the sense of imprisonment some women must have felt about their society at the time, and how freedom maybe the greatest gift a person can receive. I can re-read this book and not be bored. I think this is an excellent way to spend an afternoon."
5,"A most impressive read, a work of pure genius.","This book should make it to the best sellers list. So impressive that the author has to assure you in the beginning that it is a work of fiction. The way he weaves his plot into the real events of history is masterful. He creates a host of wonderful characters, especially the main character May Dodd herself. He has given me a new respect for the American Indian in their commitment to their families and tribes, yet has shown me why we indeed called them savages. He portrays the United States government in a way that you know he has not white-washed the truth. With the track record our government has had in the years since this was to have taken place, you wonder if events such as this one may have really happened."
1,This is the book worst book ever written,This book is filled with bias and historically inaccurate. Do not read it. This is the worst book I ever read.
5,Excellent!,A friend of mine sent this to me while I was deployed and I spent every spare second reading it!
5,fan-bygod-tastic,"IT WAS A PAGE TURNER FROM THE GETGO. GROWING UP IN S.D., BETWEEN 5 INDIAN RESERVATION, MADE THIS BOOK EVEN MORE INTERESTING TO READ."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"From beginning to end, this book is filled with history but written in a wonderful, inspiring way. It amazed me how much we Americans have changed - yet stayed the same. I look forward to Jim Fergus' next book!"
2,Poor character development,"This is not based on history, I read it because I thought it was. It lacked depth to the characters. I was very disappointed in this book."
2,Not your typical Western,"When I read a book based on something that could have happened historically, I would like for it to be at least realistic. Some content was disturbing and offensive to me from rape and murder to horrible mental institutions. I think the story could have been told without a lot of this and actually been a decent Western. Don't know how this book ever got into print!"
3,Enjoyed it.,"Wow! I wish I had read the reviews on this book before buying it. Also, I wish I was a more careful reader. I missed the fact that the whole story was not true in the beginning. I felt completely emotionally raped when I found out that the characters I had really come to love were completely fictitious. I very much enjoyed reading this book and did care about the characters in excess. I think that Fergus did a great job with the development of May Dodd and all her ""sisters"". All in all it was a very enjoyable read. I am just disappointed I did not realize sooner that it was totally false."
5,one thousand white women,"i loved the book and also loaned it out to my mother and she is half finished withit. i will then pass it along to my daughter for her to read, interesting book."
3,One Thousand White Women,"It can't be emphasized enough: this is a work of fiction. Supposedly written by a woman, it actually has a male author with male interpretations of events. I couldn't get beyond those barriers."
4,why does Amazon reiew give away the ending,"I was appalled when, halfway through the book, I read a editorial review that Amazon posted which gave away the end of this book. Someone please explain why this makes sense."
3,on thousand white women,It was interesting to read about amarican Indians and about thier life style and found out we humons have not change if some thing is unknow to us we go to difence mode instead of trying to learn about it.To this age we look at diffrent cultures and pick them apart instead of trying to learn from them.Book was well wrighten easy to read with alot of facts.
1,Did not order and here's why,"When you offer a sample of an audiobook, as you do for this one, why does the sample consist solely of the book intro, read by someone OTHER than the person who will read the book? Perhaps the overriding reason for listening to a sample is to see what the reader sounds like. No can do here...so didn't order."
2,Could not get into it,"I was SOOO bummed. I gave this book until page 120...and I just could not get into it. The beginning intrigued me, and I was excited to think how much fun this book was going to be to read! It just kept getting more and more boring, and more and more unbelievable. I realize the book is fiction. But there just was not an ounce of believablity in it. Its hard to mix real history with such an outrageous story like this.There were too many characters to have to keep up with and keep the names straight. I did not know who the book was talking about half of the time. Also, the ""accented dialogue"" was confusing and hard to read. I understand that the author was probably trying to make the book funnier, but it just made those sections harder to read.Clever idea for a book, just could not get into it :("
4,Interesting and Enjoyable,"This was a very interesting story and I enjoyed it very much. May Dodd's story is compelling from being put in an insane asylum for living with a man and bearing his children out of wedlock , to her decision to be one of the thousand brides for the Indians as a way to escape the asylum.I found her to be a great strong woman far ahead of her time. The other women who were on this journey with her were a colorful assortment of characters. I loved the names some of these Indians and white women ended up with (Fact or Fiction who knows). Jim Fergus wrote this book with such detail that I almost felt like an observer to the events happening in May's life. I enjoyed the journal details and the colorful way May sometimes explained things, and I felt for her when she was missing her children but understood her reasoning behind not jumping off the train and going back to them.The ending left me a little sad but still a great enjoyable book."
3,interesting but vaguely unsatisfying,"An interesting story but written in a way which only skims the surface of both characters and plot. You keep wanting the author to go deeper especially into his characters. Even May is only superficially written. Perhaps this is the result of Mr. Fergus being a journalist and not having do delve deep for his magazine articles? I would be interested to see future works, if only to see if this problem has been remedied."
5,indian story,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story based partially on a true historical event with a ""what if"" story to follow. A good read and enjoyable."
3,Historical slant which made me wonder--interesting,"I, at times, lost which character was being mentioned but yet there were enough hints to bring earlier descriptions to mind. The last or ending was like the ""event"" description itself ----full of action, characters and happenings all at once. For me, it was like other parts of the book, too much info all at once. Fortunately, other chapters helped clarify some of the characters but the end I had to go back to see what happened to the baby, who was saved, who died and, and--. Almost gave it 4 stars, but-----."
1,If only there was a 0 star option....,I felt obligated to finish this book for my book club. First time I recall all being in agreement on a book - this was the worst! What a shallow fantasy.
1,should have been written as straight non fiction,I am forcing myself to finish this miserable book only because it is our summer read for my book club. While the facts about the Cheyenne Indians are interesting and most probably not widely known the story line that holds it together is poorly written. Do Not Waste Your Money
1,Written like a bad Lifetime Movie.,"Terribly written book. Filled with stereotypical characters, and the typical message that rich white people are evil. The writing style is contrived and forced. It was like reading the most god-awful Lifetime movie played with the worst B list actors. The worst part about this book is that it's not written in the languistic style of the period. Frankly, people and especially a woman of the social class that the book claims May Dod comes from did not talk like that."
3,It's fiction,"Tricked into the depths of the story, I read it hungrily. Never before has history been so intriguing. I hope when the aliens come they find it."
1,Glorified Harlequin Romance,"Looking forward to learning something about this supposed historical event I'd never heard of, I settled in for a good read. I was thoroughly disgusted by the time I finished it.The sex and birth scenes are written from the perspective of a man, not a woman as you'd expect in a woman's diary, and an immature man at that. Very unbelievable.If you want to read a Harlequin Romance, but want to talk yourself into thinking you are actually reading a historically based meaningful novel, this is the book for you."
1,clueless!,"I simply cannot fathom how this book has gotten so much positive press. The writer(male) is woefully ignorant of the landscape of a woman's heart. The idea that the men of the Cheyenne tribe would tolerate some of the behaviors of the women is ridiculous. Like others have mentioned, the idea of the journal was a good one, but the way she wrote it was far beyond the reach of credibility. The characters were undeveloped- cartoonish. I really hate being so negative, but in this case, I can only give the author 1 star for a creative idea."
1,1000 White Women,"A male writer for sports and outdoor magazines has written a piece of historical fiction from a woman's point of view.... However, the writing is amateur, the point of view 21st century p.c., and the characters [typical]. When heroine & protagonist May Dodd, daughter of a wealthy, socially prominent Chicago family, is forced to go to work in a chicken factory, she claims it was ""oddly liberating to be out in the real world.""... Definitely a 19th century expression... The characters she meets on the train west include a black well-spoken ex-slave, a manly Englishwoman who has a feeling that they will be ""spiffy good friends,"" a pair of Irish sisters who are, what else, ""redheaded, freckle-faced identical twin [girls],"" and a ""large, boisterous, buxom rosy-cheeked [woman]"" who likes to sing folksongs in a robust voice... This pseudo-historic pulp fiction western romance seems to have been written to cash in on the voracious reading appetites of women's book clubs."
1,A disguised Harlequin Romance,"The diary approach: a literary device aimed at disguising lack of talent or effort (ref: the Secret Diary of Ann Boleyn, equally poorly written).This book feels like a bunch of male fantasies, from the insane asylum to the couplings with savages. It offers little to no exploration of characters; and a gross oversimplification of situations and reactions. Why oh why was the prologue so funny, when the rest of the book fell so flat? Was it even written by the same person?PS: each time the main character repeated Good God I thought I'd scream. Did some bored reader count? NOT a good book club choice."
3,One Unbelievable White Woman,"The only thing wrong with One Thousand White Women is that it is not a science fiction novel. If May had been a 21st century female ethnographer transported to the past to chronicle her life as the wife of a Cheyenne chief, then her voice as the narrator would have been believable. As it stands, however, it is difficult to believe that a woman of her time period and breeding would have been so open minded about race, class, and sex. Her opinions on everything are very ""politically correct"" by today's standards. All of the other pivotal characters are flawed like us real folks, but Mary Dodd's character seems infallable.Despite this problem, if you can suspend disbelief in the narrator's voice, it is an enjoyable read that can be pretty shocking at times."
1,Truly awful,"How did this book get published? Can I get a refund? If you haven't bought this book yet, do yourself a favor - don't. Unless, like me, you were the unsuspecting victim of a book club selection. But if you are looking for fantasy fiction of the bodice ripping, throbbing member variety, with improbable characters and trite, cliche-filled writing, this is the book for you. On a serious note, the book is an insult to women."
3,Women's role in any culture was not this strong in 1845 onto,I feel the author was trying to show the white acceptable female of the 1800's in a positive light. History says what the unacceptable female had to do to survive. The Indians at that time had a very strict culture and the women would never allow such conduct that the heroine of the book enjoyed...yet alone the men. I think the author did alot of research. I just couldn't believe this woman's story.
1,Not entirely historically correct,"I am about half through the book; it's OK, but not terribly historically accurate. Am I the only one who noticed that Phemie is singing ""This Train is Bound For Glory"" which was written by Woody Guthrie in the 1900's? I find myself looking up other aspects on line to make sure that they are accurate. If you want a good, historical fiction book about the plains Native Americans, I suggest ""Hanta Yo""."
5,Great book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this book. It was recommended to me by a total stranger in a used book store. We got to discussing Historial Fiction and she encouraged me to read this. Jim Fergus tells a great story - very captivating right to the end! I, also, read his book Wild Girl and loved it, too. I wish he would write more like these two!!!"
2,Great idea but terrible execution,"I thought the premise of this book was intriguing, and it had just barely enough to keep me reading to the end so that I could report back to my book club. However, not for ONE split second did I believe that 1) this was a woman writing or 2) that this was written by someone of the time period.The plot and dialogue were both cliched and completely contemporary. The writing style was so ""not of the period"" that it was laughable. The characters were pretty one-dimensional. But I got through it for my book club."
5,One Thousand White Women: The Journals of May Dodd,"A fascinating story! Made believable by accurate historical research and detail, the story follows ""white"" women who are accepted into Indian tribal culture prior to and during the last days of the nomadic tribal life and the institution of the reservation system. Very descriptive. I'd definitely read it again and recommend it to others -"
5,One Thousand White Women,"I was pleased with the development of the the women in this story, and the way the author was able to bring them together to support and care for one another. The women were unique, and yet much like so many women I have met. If you are looking for a neat and tidy ""happily ever after"" story, this is not it. The ending is surprising, sad, and realistic."
2,Filled with stereotypes,"I was so disappointed by this book. It was nothing but stereotypes and was a great disappointment. Also, I found it troubling how much time the author spent talking about the main character going to the bathroom. Once would have been enough. Please don't waste your time reading this drivel."
5,Love it when a great reccomendation leads to an AWESOME BOOK!,Was a wonderful book with great strong female lead. I love it when the characters grow and you love all the characters you are meant to love and hate those you are meant to hate! It was a beautiful and sad story. I highly recommend to all book clubs and anyone wishing to have a great read!
4,Good adventure,"I found this book to be engaging,entertaining and well written. The author made you feel like you were right there during that time period. The author exposed a piece of her life that shared how early America was settled. Some of her experiences were both frightening, unbelievable and a ture story of survival. Once I began reading the story I couldn't put it down, it's a great read."
3,One Thousand White Women,If I am rating this on service from Amazon...that was excellent. I personallydid not really LOVE the book. Way too much graphic details for me.But I love ordering and dealing with Amazon.....efficient and helpful!Carolyn Dorman
3,Remember it's fiction,"Everyone at my book club enjoyed this book. We are all well read women and evaluated the book in the context that it was fiction. It was not meant to be a historical fiction but one could have made the assumption that it was. If anyone has read ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" you would know that this book was not far off base from the treatment of Native Americans.I keep a journal myself and one day hope that my grandchildren will read it and know the kind of woman that I was."
3,Better Concept Than Execution,"In 1875, Chief Little Wolf from the Cheyenne tribe, approached President Grant with an unusual proposal: Give 1000 white women as brides to his warriors. When they had children, the children would leave the tribes with their mothers and assimilate into the white culture. Grant turned this proposal down, but the book is written as if Chief Little Wolf's request was granted.May Dodd was one of the women who volunteered to marry a savage, as a way to escape her confinement to a mental institution.She was the one of the most narcissistic, self-absorbed protagonists I've encountered in years. So much so, that she made the book tedious. The sections dealing with Cheyenne customs were interesting, but the lion's share of material was precious and dull."
5,Excellent - Truly enjoyable,"I found this book incredibly hard to put down. I was stealing odd moments in the day to get back to it. When I was only halfway through I was sad to know that the story would eventually end. The voice of May Dodd was very believable and honest. This book is simply good, readable, enjoyable fiction. I highly recommend it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I read this novel because I wanted to learn more about Native American culture, and that's about all that it's good for. The rest of it is a really bad combination of melodrama, psuedo-feminist blather, and every late 19th-century racial/ethnic sterotype that you can think of. The characters are narrowly-drawn and completely lack any depth, and the story reads like a bad romance novel. The details about life among the Cheyenne Indians are the only part of the novel worth reading."
2,Eh!,An easy read. Obvious morale. Everything ended too pat. Good writing but not enough story for me.
4,Take it with a grain of salt,"You know, I liked it. Read it in two days. I liked May Dodd. Granted, she's as 21st century woman as can be, and the characters are typical. But I like typical because it fits the book. The ending is sad. I hate it when a book has the potential to totally work out in the end and then the author makes it end horrifically. Yech.In any event, May was a fun character. But too male-written. It's never good when a straight man tries to write a woman. I bet this book could've been five stars if a chick had written it. Other than that, yeah, it's good."
2,Historical Titillation,"Decided I disliked the whole premise. Destruction of native Indian civilizations is a very ""grave"" subject but seemed to be manipulated for purposes of titillation, voyeurism, and mass-merchandising. Too many details (hypothecated/ fabricated) trying to chase a narrative.Does seem to have some application and portent for us via middle-class extinction program. Corporations have generated enormous CEO bonuses/ stockholder dividends for sending jobs overseas?? Right, we all just want to be penniless cogs in the machine. Have seen applicable bumper sticker that pictures head of Indian chief and slogan, ""Sure, you can trust the government!"""
1,overrated,"Louis L'Amour does a far better job of capturing the wild West and the culture of Indians of that period. The book makes you believe it is real, but is really fiction based on one small factoid, which itself may have never actually happened: the trading of white women for horses with the western American Indians."
2,Very disappointing,"Good writing style, terrible concept: Post-Civil War, President Grant approves a program to marry off women from the dregs of society (ie, mental institutions, jails, ex-slaves, alcoholics, etc) to a tribe of Native Americans in order to create a mixed-race. Supposedly, this is meant to make the assimilate the Native Americans into our new American culture within a generation as the women reproduce with the Native Americans.It's probably one of the worst historical fiction books I've ever read. Immensely demeaning to women, the protagonist is probably supposed to be a spirited woman far ahead of her time. I found her insulting and could never connect with her on any level. The author clearly means to present Native Americans in a sympathetic light, as well, but only succeeds in perpetuating too many stereotypes.I'd like to be able to say that the storyline improved by the end of the book, but unfortunately, I never made it that far."
1,What a Fantasy!,"My book club and I found May Dodd's early comments irritating and implausible. I couldn't imagine any woman of her era acting or thinking as she did. Her love life was impossible for a woman of her background and how she could have left her children seems highly unlikely. Had she jumped ship (so to speak) and left the train early on to get back to the children she SAYS she loves so much, it would have made sense - but then where would the author have been with his book idea? Nowhere! The women of pioneer days were courageous, serious and determined. I found May frivilous in her thoughts and many of her deeds. I hate to bash a writer as I'm sure the author worked hard on this novel, but for my group of 5 women, this novel just didn't seem reasonable. Maybe this is how Jim Fergus thinks a pioneer woman might behave, but we just never could come to terms with his ideas. Sorry, but we all agreed it was one of the worst offerings our club ever read!"
1,Pulp Western,"As a light read, Fergus' novel succeeds, but many failures must be overlooked. Telling the story through the journals works best when May is describing in narrative the way of life among the Cheyenne. I found the passages in her journals written in dialogue awkward- more like a script than personal writing. Read as entertainment, the cast of characters holds the reader's interest but offers no insights into the relations between the native Americans and the encroaching whites. (And may in fact, damage relations with the Irish, the Swiss, etc.)."
3,Looks gourmet but deep down it's fast food,"From the look of the book (nicely designed trade paperback) and the rave reviews from other readers, I thought this was going to be meaty reading I could savor. I was wrong. Sure, it was a page-turner, but so are the harlequin romances this had more in common with than serious fiction. I admit I too couldn't stop turning the pages, because there was always some other tragedy around the next bend that would soon befall May Dodd and her band of Injun wives. But a long list of events does not make a great book. I kept gobbling and finished it fast, and like fast food, I was less than satisfied."
2,Unrealistic protrayal of American Indian Life,"This story was too far fetched to be believeable, and the character May Dodd was too full of herself to arouse sympathy. Most disturbing was the unrealistic protrayal of life in the West. It was not all freedom, nature, and wild beauty. The Indians suffered from disease, poor sanitation, insects crawling over everything, and had very short average life spans. Life on the plains was hard. A forty year old Indian would not look younger than his age, as the chief was described here, but would be missing most of his teeth, and be weathered from outdoor life. The ending at least is realistic, but sad."
1,wasted time and money,"Like many others, I read this book for my book club. It is the only reason that I completed reading this horrendous piece of trash.My first impression of the book is of a man getting his jollies writing this absurd and raunchy rubbish that is somehow being passed off as ""literature."" If he thinks he even came close to writing how a female thinks, feels, or speaks, or what a woman wants, he needs some education.I love historical fiction, but this isn't even written well, and I feel so sorry for those who reviewed this book, citing it as the greatest book they had ever read. To what have the minds of Americans been reduced? Banal at best."
4,Little known history,"I really enjoyed learning about these women, their obligation and their varied personalities. I think it could have been better written but it didhold my interest. In some areas I would have liked more details."
3,Interesting Enough,Hmmmm..... a very interesting book. I'm still confused over how much of this book really took place and what part was fiction. The journals surround the Brides for Indians program between the Cheyenne and the U.S. Government led by President Grant. It was fascinating albeit revolting at times. I'm glad I've read it just left me with more questions.
5,A Good Read,"I found this novel absolutely gripping, could not put it down. For anyone who prefers to get their history via fiction, it's one of those....of course, you have to know where history leaves off and fiction begins, and the author pretty much covers that in a prologue, and gives pointers to history in his bibliography. Now I'm psyched, I want to read Native merican fiction. PS: I don't understand some of the negative reviews posted here. And I think Fergus did a convincing female POV."
4,I was suprised by how much I liked this book . .,"When our book club picked this book, I was prepared to be bored. But I really liked this story. The story basically follows the lives of 1000 white women who are traded to the native Indians for 1000 of their horses. Their struggles to communicate with their new husbands and adjust to their new lives makes for interesting drama."
5,An Extraordinary Book,"I just finished this book and I was actually depressed to put it down. One of the very best books I have ever read. It is a wonderful story and gives a great insight into an American Indian tribe, one I have never had before. The main character in the book, May Dodd, is an inspiration to women."
4,Interesting and impossible,Very interesting development of an idea that would have never been implemented.It is quite easy to read for the most time and very entertaining.
5,Great read with unexpected story line,"I asked some friends what was the best thing they'd read lately. When they mentioned the title of this book I could not imagine what it was about and visualized something like the Million Man March...in reverse? :-)Even when they told me a bit of the plot line I wasn't sure about ""One Thousand White Women"". But they said they couldn't put it down so I gave it a try. I loved it - so much so that I bought it as a gift for someone else. The book intertwines a bit of a real story with 'what might have been'. I found myself so engrossed in the book that I forgot it was fiction...and wished it wasn't."
3,Sad story...,"Hmmm, how to rate this book... The beginning sucked me in but then somewhere in the middle, it lost me. It seemed to be tragedy after tragedy after tragedy. Overall, the book was very depressing. I felt (as I see others did after reading reviews) that some parts weren't realistic for the time period."
2,Disappointing read,This book was interesting but disappointing to me. The characters were one dementional to me. Nowhere in the book did it describe the hardships of their day to day lives. It seemed to me I did not learn much at all about the Indians in the story. I can't really say after reading this book that I understand any of the true feelings of any of the women or the men in this book.
4,What an interesting story concept,I absolutely fell in love with the characters and their adorable accents!
2,Never believable,"This book, ""1000 White Women"" was disappointing from the start. It constantly sounded like a man trying to write a woman's voice (which he was!) and thus May was completely unbelievable as a 1800's woman, even a spirited, independent one. There were so many things which simply did not ""ring true"" as a woman's experience. The flaunting of Native American customs was especially unbelievable, and worrisome. The author may have thought that he was showing respect for the Cheyenne culture, but there were so many mixed messages, it was just a mess."
3,I've read better historical fiction,"Historical fiction is my favorite genre, and I think I have pretty high expectations. This novel was a decent read, but I thought it was a bit overdone. Too many characatures, partly through over-use of idiomatic dialogue. Nice portrait of the communal life of the Plains Indians, though."
2,"So much promise, so little realized","I too had high hopes for this book. The premise is engaging and it could have been a fun and interesting read. As it was I ended up skipping through the book looking for something of interest. The lead character, May was so obnoxious and condescending that I was inclined to believe maybe the family did have good reason for putting her in the asylum---narssicistic borderline personality disorder! I agree with other reviews about all characters being one dimensional and stereo-types. The biggest complaint however was that such an interesting premise could come out so uninteresting. Even the sex scenes, with such a sexually liberated character,were boring! (and come on---everytime she had sex she got pregnant, except when she was raped????)"
5,great book,"was three different book club recommendations and we all loved it, even some went out to buy it for friends, etc for Christmas..... well written, almost visual at time.... so glad I read it and other in my book club enjoyed it so much"
3,Interesting Pictures,"This book is a compilation of photographs of cars and car related materials from junkyards and other locations around the country. Most of the pages are pictures of cars in surreal locations, or specific car parts grouped together. All in all the images are quite interesting, however the book lacks a coherent message. This mix of ""junk"" was not what I expected; however for those very interested in junk or all things automobile it could prove a worthwhile purchase."
4,Good Basic Info,Good set but after watching The Beauty Of Snakes on Blu ray I realised there is no other way of watching tv other than HD.
3,Gift-No Review,This item was a gift to be used in a grade school class therefore I have no way of reviewing it.
3,"Nice, but a little more casual","This is a nice comfortable shoe, but it's a little more casual looking than I was expecting. While rubber soles are much more comfortable they just look a little cheaper to me."
5,awesome shoes,I have this pair in black and orange. totally worth every penny. and I got the first pair at full price in the rockport store.so glad i was able to pick this up for 13/ of price on amazon
3,Narrower than normal,"These shoes look decent, but they do run narrow. My husband wears medium, but these are narrower than normal and not very comfortable. The quality is also not at par with Rockport sold in store."
5,Gorgeous,"Written in a combination of poetry and journal entry you really feel what it was like for Billie Jo in the story. Her hurt, her sorrow, her guilt, the frustration with the dust and her relationship with her father. It's written for children, but anyone with half a heart will be moved by this."
4,WMF Nortica Hostess Set,"We chose the WMF Nortica design because of the quality of the heavy 18/8 steel and the timeless classic look of the brushed metal finish and simple, elegant lines. This 5-piece hostess set is all of that. The design of the salad fork is kind of funky but all the pieces are usable, well designed and look fantastic."
4,Elegant but slim,"Amazingly elegant salad serving set which can also double for general serving purposes. Unfortunately, the faces of the spoons are rather narrow giving you comparatively small servings.This should keep you as slim and elegant as the Taika."
4,An uppity woman,"This book was written as a scholarly work, but I approached it from a non-scholarly point of view. That said, I found the work to be a memoir of a fascinating set of episodes in a medieval woman's life, translated in a workmanlike--but generally flat--fashion by Williamson. The foreword provides a bit of historical context for those without an intimate knowledge of the political situation in fifteenth-century Hungary, while the extensive afterword delves into the lives and roles of women in the middle ages, without ever actually getting around to saying much. I cannot really speak to the quality of scholarship in the book, but I would recommend that the lay reader skim the foreword, enjoy the memoirs and skip the afterword altogether."
3,Ruined by artwork,"It's a GM Screen, tables, charts, etc. Pretty good selection and i like the multi-panel design. However, it is ruined by the cover art. Man, couldn't they find some better art? Even recycled art from older books would've been better than the disappointing cartoon-y purple travesty that is the cover of the GURPS GMs Screen."
5,Useful!,What could be more useful to a GM than a screen that doubles as a reference and a cover for his campaign secrets? This one for GURPS is very nice.
2,Less than expected.,"This video is only 26 minutes long ( only 18 worth of abdominal exercises). Even though Ms. Austin is very athletic and cheerful, I do not think it is worth its price. It is 6 minutes worth of exercise you have to replay everyday for two weeks at a time. Not the variety I was expecting."
3,Rev Run's short and sweet,"This is more of an EP than a full length album. 10 tracks (Amazon forgot to include the last track, Distortion) totalling just over 26 minutes. While I liked it, it is a bit short, and Rev Run doesn't really break or preach new ground. Every song samples the same old same old Run-DMC beat, samples, or lyrics. That's fine with me because I love Run DMC. This is far superior to to Run DMC's Crown Royal which using the moniker DMC was a joke, but take this as a Rev Run solo effort. It's fast paced, refreshingly old school, and sits well with the early Run DMC albums. Also, for a rapper to release something nowadays without a million other guest rappers or producers, it's consistent."
3,23 MINUTES. For an album. Come on! That's half an album.,"The single, ""Mind on the Road,"" is great. I expected more of the same, and, while the rest is okay, 23 minutes is a rip off, even at $7.99 on sale. I expected at least a full 40 minutes of great rock rap in the style of RUN DMC. Was Rev. Run in a hurry or did he just need some fast cash? Buy the single if you can."
2,Run Also In New Book,"When I saw Reverend Run in the count dracula cape I thought he looked like an oddball. But then I read the new book Raising Hell and understood that the man had suffered a nervous breakdown at one point. This album is decent but the book Raising Hell might be of more interest to people who want to revisit the energy Run-DMC, both members, brought to rap music and popular culture."
2,Dissapointed,"I have been a RUN DMC fan for a few years now and was very dissapointed in Rev Run on his new album. First, it's only like 23 minutes long, for a ten track CD, I was excpecting like 35-45 minutes all together. Second, his raps sounded very much like a guy putting too much effort to become screaming at the top of his lungs. Third, it wasn't typically RUN DMC like in Walk this Way, Tricky, and others. Don't buy it."
1,An embarassment to Adventure Gaming.,"Having played well over 100 Adventure games, I must say that this was the absolute worst game I've seen. Most of the puzzles lack any rhyme, reason or logic. This was the first and only game I ever saw that came with a hint book (and I soon found out why). I was finally reduced to following the hint book in order to progress through the game, as none of the ""puzzles"" had intuitive or logical solutions. Without the hint book, your best tactic is to close your eyes and just continue click your mouse on the screen and hope for something to happen. The graphics were incredibly average, the ""humor"" sophmoric, and when I finished the game I wondered why I had bothered. Don't wast your money."
3,It was alright.,"This book was not all that bad, it was interesting and I finished it. It did move kind of slow in a lot of parts. It's really just the story of a young hustla named Javon tying to make the switch from drugs to the music biz. Javon's partna Derrick can't see life without the streets, Peaches is a stripper wanna be video ho who wants Javon to put her on. Fatima is an up and coming singer with a troubled past and an incredible voice. All these people's lives are on a colloision course thanks to jealousy and hate."
2,BORING!!!!!,This book was a slow start and became quite boring. Maybe I expect more from TCP and I didn't get it!
3,so so,the book was slow at times but i read the book in one day and it was pretty good i didnt see the ending coming up likee it did but the book is a most read in the middle it speeds up and just takes off great book
1,She tried..........,"This book was cool to pass the time. It wouldn't call it a triple crown classic, like ""Gangsta"" or ""Black"" but Deborah's style and vocabulary both shine. I was noticing that there were only a few pages left in the book, then BANG! the end came out of nowhere. I call it a ""5 page climax"" with the assassination attempt on Derrick, then his partners shooting, then the book is over. You have to read the epilogue to find out the why's and who's. She could have easily just left it like that and wrote a part two.(she still could)"
2,No Love or Loyalty,This book wasn't really tht great. The title had nothing to do with the story itself. I don't recommend this book to no-one.
1,Terrible reproduction prints,"This is the first time I have really regreted ordering a book on line. The book on Twatchman's art was obviously not sellable in stores, so it must have been a reject. Some of rhe reproductions were so faded that one could not tell what it was suppose to be."
3,Bulky Braceket,In the picture is difficult to see how big is or how it will look in a woman wirst...Is a very nice watch nice boxed....
2,Need to adjust age recommendation up,Bought for 17 month old. He wouldn't keep in his ear for more than a few seconds. After three tries I gave up.The kit has one pair of ear plugs. Manufacturer recommends you throw the plugs away after a single roundtrip set of flights.
2,Did not work for me,"I did an experiment and found that these do not work for me. I have unusually small ear canals, and so the (child-size) earplanes will fit in my right ear but not in my left. During my last plane trip, I inserted the right earplane one hour before landing, as instructed, and experienced the same amount of pain on descent and blurry hearing after landing that I always do in both ears. I won't be using these again."
5,Don't need to be a kid to use these,"Before Earplanes, I had tried all kinds of ear plugs and didn't understand why they didn't block out the sound, and wouldn't stay in my ears. It turns out I have quite narrow ear canals. These work perfectly."
3,Im unsure,I bought these for our trip to Hawaii. My six year old son used them (I placed them into his ears). He still complained that his ears hurt a lot especially upon landing. So I'm not really sure if these did anything. Would his ears have hurt more? After i decided that they didn't work my son was scared that it would hurt more without them and didn't let me throw them away.I will also say that i wish that they came with a string/rope thing to attach the two together. My son dropped them several times and we had to look all over our area to find the missing ear piece.
2,TODDLER WOULDN'T KEEP THESE IN,My daughter was 14 months old when we tried to use these. She wouldn't keep them in for more than a second. They kept falling out onto the floor and eventually got lost somewhere on the plane.
1,"May work, but....","I could not get my one and a half year old to keep them in. So I don't think it'll work on toddlers very well. I even tried putting them in after she fell asleep, but she was wise to that as well. I think just getting them to drink or swallow or use a pacifier may work better"
3,seems to work,But they kept falling out but when I got them in my baby did not cry or I just got lucky don't know
1,Worthless,Can I review these things at less than 1 star?Absolutely worthless! They provide no effect whatsoever in flight. You look like an idiot with these blue bars sticking out of your ear and the worst part is they are $7.99 in the airport.DO NOT BUY!
2,This work needs a different title,"I have read almost all of George Weigel's works and found them to be outstanding, informative, accurate and simply a good read. In ""God's Choice"" I feel the title is misleading. I expected to see much more on the reasons for and methodology of Pope Bendict's selection as pontiff. Instead, I found the first 30% of the book to be a rehash of John Paul's Pontificate and death, 40% of the book detailing the church's past and current situation and what Mr. Weigel thinks the current Pope needs to do about it and filler. Maybe it should have been entitled ""Geoge Weigel's View of the needs of Pope Benedict XVI""."
5,The transition of the papacy brought to life,George Weigel chronicles the last days of Pope John Paul II and the election of Pope Benedict with clarity and sensitivity. Weigel blends with ease the narrative of the story and the profound human and spiritual legacy of John Paul II.
3,A hint of things to come,"As the author who 'wrote the book' on the late Pope John Paul II (the biography ""Witness to Hope"") George Weigel is particularly well informed. He also gives us rare insights into the origins and backgrounds of an ancient ritual, the election of a new pope.Although the book predates the speech of Pope Benedict XVI in Regensburg, there are already hints there of things to come, as Weigel points out that the, then Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, doesn't consider it a coincidence that Christianity was first ""incultured"" in the late classical world."
1,A retrograde horror,"These accolades of Benedict XVI are clearly by those who fail to understand his horrid background. As John Paul II's orthodoxy enforcer, Ratzinger was affectionately known as ""god's rottweiler."" As John Paul's henchman, he undid much of the advances of Vatican II, silenced progressive theologians, and penned vicious attacks against gay and lesbian people (remember the 1986 Halloween massacre?). The selection of Ratzinger is for me proof positive that the appointment of a pope is nothing more than politics, and arrogance -- hardly ""God's Choice"". These are dark days for the church."
5,LOVE IT,easy to install and looks great! amzed with how easy it was to install. did have a slight issue at first with it loosing up after a few days of driving but think that was due to me not tightening down properly initially
2,"Residue, Residue, RESIDUE","I can't find an environmentally friendly automatic dishwasher detergent that does not leave my dishes chalky!!! I've used this alone, with rinse aid, with baking soda and with rinse aid AND baking soda. Still I get chalky dishes."
1,Doesn't cut it...,"Bought this product hoping to reduce my dependence on more traditional cleaners and their harsh chemicals. Seventh Generation makes some great products (their all-purpose cleaner, shower cleaner, and laundry detergent are great), but unfortunately this automatic dish detergent just doesn't get the job done. Many of the glasses and silverware that go through my dishwasher still come out with a white residue, and pots and pans that formerly got clean come out with nasty baked-on grime. It seems to have particular trouble with residues from milk and from starchy foods like beans, lentils, or rice. Never had any of this trouble with Cascade, which I have now gone back to and it is working great.If you're sensitive to the harsher ingredients in mainstream dish liquids, this does get about 75% of the dishes clean. But I'd stick to the big brands if you possibly can."
1,Leaves a filmy residue...,"I bought this stuff at a brick-and-mortar store and have been very disappointed with it. It doesn't get all of my dishes clean, and it leaves a film on many items! It leaves a funny smell in my glasses that I can smell when I'm drinking water, which makes me wonder what chemicals I'm also ingesting! Even if they are biodegradable, I don't want to consume them!! I am very disappointed in this product and will be glad when the bottle runs out so I can go back to my normal detergent. It may be less environmentally-friendly, but at least I never thought I could be drinking it!!!"
1,Not as good as expected,I loved the concept of this eco-friendly detergent but it just doesn't work as well as I had hoped. It leaves a gritty residue on everything.
1,Left a white film on all my dishes,"I had such high hopes for this product, alas it left my dishes dirtier than before. I went through an entire bottle hoping it would somehow rectify itself, it didn't. All my silverware had a perpetual film on it. I painstakingly buffed each piece out and went back to Cascade for now. Oh well."
2,"Poor Performance, unlike the powder which worked great for us. Will not buy again","We have been using Seventh Generation powder for close to 9 years. Amazon stopped selling the bulk/case subscribe and save 8 packs, so I went for this gel [""free and clear""] b/c my wife hates scents on her dishes. Unfortunately, unlike the powder, it is not nearly as effective on dried food residue or melted cheese residue that the powder version removed much more easily. I will have to find a cheaper powder version...or the ""pre-measured singles""/""Auto dish Pacs"" which are powder, although those are more costly...very disappointed. Will be contacting 7th Generation to voice my displeasure....avoid unless you like to pre-wash your dishes...or hand wash the ones that don't come out well.Does it clean? Yes. Does it do a good job? No. Hope this helps."
5,gets the job done,"I have used this for a few months now, it works great, no build up on the dishwasher or dishes."
1,Awful Dishwasher Gel,"We have been trying to switch over to more eco-friendly cleaning products for our house since we have a new baby (never too early to make an impression on small minds). We found this and the liquid soap from Seventh Generation and decided to give it a try. We did like the way the liquid soap cleans, but the smell sort of turned us off. When we used the dishwasher gel, however, our dishes came out with dingy brownish spots all over them. It was absolutely disgusting, and we had to rewash our dishes by hand to use them.We have since switched over to the Method smarty dish tablets-much better. In fact, we switched over the liquid soap to Method as well. I think we'll just stay with that brand."
1,Never again,"Like many, I try to choose environmentally friendly products, even if that means spending more. With this product it was a real disappointment. First of all, the bottles were poorly packed, and a couple of them spilled much of their content. A mess. More importantly, this product just does not do the job. I had to wash dishes again after running the dishwasher on a regular basis-even if I had rinsed them before. I like other Seventh Generation products, but this is a real bummer. Additives did not help. I am now back to Cascade Complete. It is not environmentally friendly to force people to wash their dishes twice-waste of water and energy."
1,Not ready for prime time...,"I use and like many of Seventh Generation's products, and find most to be just as effective as the non-eco-friendly alternatives. This one, unfortunately, does not measure up. Bottom line, it does not get the dishes clean. Every load I've run with this stuff ends up with quite a bit of food residue on it. The only way to avoid it is to actually wash the dishes beforehand, which obviates the need for a dishwasher."
1,A BIG Dissapointment,"I, also, have switched all of my cleaning products over to eco-friendly brands and have been pleased with everything except Seventh Generation Dishwasher gel. My high-end flatware is so dull & gray it looks like tin camping gear and the inside of the dishwasher is terribly stained. I hate to go back to a name brand but this stuff just doesn't work. I cancelled my subsribe and save but am now stuck with half a case!"
3,Recommend,"I am trying very hard to like this product because it is non-toxic, but I find it very frustracting when my dishes still comes out dirty. The only way that this product would work is if you would scrub your dishes prior to loading them into the dish washer. If you have dried up dishes, you can forget about it. Your dishes will come out with 30% of the dried up stuff still on it. This smells way better than that strong odor that you get when you open the dishwasher after you have used Cascade. Cascade cleans better, but it is toxic. So, the choice is clean dishes and toxic OR semi-clean dishes and non-toxic."
1,This green product made me blue,"I've been on a mad, green frenzy, detoxifying my home and replacing toxic products for products which are safer for my family and the environment. My gorcery store doesn't have a huge selection of these products, but this was one of them. So I bought it and was hugely disappointed. The dishes did not come out clean and were covered in a filmy residue. I returned the product to my store for a refund. A few weeks later, I went to Whole Foods (we don't live near one) and bought the Ecover tablets. So far they work great-very comparable to Electrosol in both performance and price. I requested Ecover at my grocery store, but it looks like I'll be buying them from Amazon."
2,isn't cleaning well!,"Sorry- 4 days of trial, and not impressed.I had better luck with Ecover ( but hated their box- powder-the lack of a metal spout was a mess!), and Method grapefruit tabs.Will go back to Method."
2,Seventh Generation Dishwasher Gel,"I love most Seventh Generation products, however, this detergent just does not get my dishes clean and I have a very new and excellent dishwasher made my LG. I am trying a new ""green"" product, I hope it works better. Once again, this is the only seventh generation product I am not happy with."
2,Serious flaws,"We have been a fan of Seventh Generation products for several months. We have had great luck with the laundry detergent and glass cleaner... the dishwasher gel is a different story. While we all should do out part to help the environment it is preferred that green products work to an acceptable level. Unfortunately - the Seventh Generation Dishwasher Gel has a serious flaw... it leaves very large and noticeable white streak. Compared to the Cascade Dual Action... there is not much of a comparison.While the dishes come out of the dishwasher clean - they certainly are not ""Spotless"". After about 5 uses we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and we switched back to Cascade. Final verdict.. We will continue to look for a ""Green"" dishwashing gel."
3,Feel-good product with slightly filmy results,"I have to agree with several of the other reviewers, where I do feel better that we are using a product that will hopefully cause less stress on the Earth -- and on us -- even if it might not clean as thoroughly as other eco-friendly products. (Since we got our dishwasher we have only used eco cleaners in it, although growing up my mom used Cascade powder which I seem to recall did an OK job in cleaning but was probably chemically bad for us as well as the Earth.)I loved, loved, loved Method dish cubes but they are not be making them anymore which is a shame; cleaned well and came in easy-to-use cubes and weren't cheap but were environmentally friendly -- bleach-free. As a second choice, though, this product is OK. The lemon scent is fine. Some dishes when loaded too closely together get slightly filmy, although never the whole load and not enough to run the spotty few through twice."
3,"Leaves a residue, no doubt about it.","I love the idea that they're environmentally conscious, but it does leave a residue. I will look for another environmentally conscious brand."
1,I wish it really cleaned...,"I was very disappointed in this product. It didn't clean the dishes, and it leaves a wierd black/brown residue on the dishes and in the dishwasher. I love the diapers, wipes, laundry detergent, and liquid dish soap, but the dishwasher gel does not do the job."
1,Didn't measure up,I wanted to like this detergent but it just didn't measure up. It couldn't get the tea stains off of my tea cups and tea pot no matter how many times I ran them through.
2,Leaves a film,"I had high hopes, but this didn't get my glasses clean. There's a film on everything, and many items didn't come out clean even though I had rinsed it all first. I have heard the powder is better; I may give that a try next."
2,Disappointed.,This product simply didn't clean our dishes. I was very hopeful before I bought it and very disappointed after I used it. Wish I could say differently since I love its being organic but honesty dictates otherwise. I can't recommend it.
1,Does Not Clean Dishes,"I bought this product because I wanted a dishwasher detergent without phosphorus, but this product has been worthless. We prewash all of our dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and they still come out dirty, especially the silverware. We've used additional rinse aids, but it hasn't helped. We will go back to using Cascade and it will likely be more environmental just because of the water we have wasted using Seventh Generation's dishwashing liquid."
1,A bummer...,"So I have attempted to switch as much as possible to environmentally friendly stuff. I like several Seventh Generation products, but the auto dishwasher gel is pretty bad. It leaves a strange film on my dishes, particularly those that are closest to the reservoir. I've found that if I mix a small dab of Cascade with this stuff, it's ok, but the goal was to get away from using Cascade and the like... and I bought an entire case of it. Darn! I will try the other environmentally friendly dishwasher detergents as soon as I finish this stuff (which will be in 2 years, at this rate). There's got to be a better product out there (or coming)."
1,Won't take out tea,My tea cups look like they haven't even been washed. I have a brand new high end dishwasher that did a great job with tea in cups and pots using my old detergent but now I'm stuck with a whole bottle of this stuff that leaves my tea things nasty looking and have to be re-washed by hand. Can't wait till it's gone and never again. They are clean enough but don't look it.
1,Disappointed with this product ...,I don't have a very good dishwasher so when the dishes had film on them and cups still had coffee stains I wasn't surprised. Even the inside panel of the dishwasher was filthy. Yesterday i picked up another Eco Friendly dishwashing liquid I found at Walmart just to see if it made a difference and boy did it. The minute I opened the dishwasher and the front panel was clean I knew it wasn't the dishwasher causing the problems it was the dishwasher liquid. I examined all the dishes and they are without film the inside of the dishwasher looks brand new it's so clean. I had to jump on the computer right away to cancel my subscription and write up a review. Now I have to figure out what to do with the other 6 bottles I have.If you are interested in the other dish washing liquid I tried and love it's Palmolive ECO+.
2,Was going to give a 3 until I read the other review,"In order for your dishes to get thoroughly clean w/ this product, they MUST be rinsed clean prior to being washed, which I learned on my second use of this product. It says it has NO phosphates, which I felt was great for my Anolon Titanium cookware. It left a film on the cookware, but otherwise did not seem to affect the surface. I'm also concerned about Seventh Generation's integrity after reading the other reviewer's Consumer's Report comments. I still like the lavender dish soap, laundry detergent, and softener. Not so crazy about the toilet paper or paper towels either."
3,It's okay,"This detergent isn't as powerful as standard, non-biodegradable ones, but if you rinse off all your plates before loading the dishwasher, then only the most stubborn stains might remain.I thought that all biodegradable detergents would be like this, but that was before I discoveredGrabGreen Automatic Dishwashing Detergent, Fragrance Free, 24 Loads, 15.2-Ounce- those pouches pack a much stronger punch than does this Seventh Generation. Since both products are equally good for the environment, I see no reason to choose this one."
2,Disappointed,"I love Seventh Generation, but I do not like this product. My dishes do not get clean. I have to completely rinse and almost hand wash before putting dishes into my dishwasher, for them to come out clean. There is almost always a white residue on the bottom of my glasses and my silverware. If only seventh generation could make a dish washer detergent like their dish soap."
5,Seventh Generation Dishwasher Gel Review,"I love, love, love this product! It is all natural, no nasty chemicals, and doesn't harm the environment. It does cost a little more than the conventional, chemical ladden products out there, but Seventh Generation does a fantastic job. I haven't changed anything I do with this product, meaning I still rinse my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher (not wash) and I still cram my dishwasher to the fullest capacity (because I detest hand washing!). Even with a crammed dishwasher full of dishes, this product did very well. I paired it with the environmentally friendly Seventh Generation Rinse Aid and you're good to go. If more people bought these environmentally friendly products, it would drive up demand and the cost would come down. My only complaint is that one bottle leaked in the box during shipping. Still, I highly recommend this product."
2,"Neither ""green"" nor effective. Waste of money.","This is a really poor performing product which leave glass dingy and simply does not clean well in the dishwasher. Wish I didn't have 5 more bottles of this stuff..... ugh! Only bright spot: does a good job as a granite counter top cleaner with a damp sponge. Doesn't lift stains but does wipe down daily dirt just fine. May try it as shampoo next on my dog. You know, to get rid of those five bottles...."
1,Just doesn't work,"I love to be able to buy products that don't damage the environment and in general love 7th generation products. However, this dishwashing gel just does not work - it leaves lots of stuff on the dishes, as well as a film. I have compromised and like the Palmolive Eco. Also, I just fill the soap dispenser half full."
1,Not the best dish washer detergent,"If you want dirty dishes...then this is the dish washer detergent for you! Otherwise, purchase Cascade Complete or another name brand detergent and you dishes will be clean. I do not recommend this product and I buy many 7th generation products."
3,no better than anything else I've used,"I tried the gel because I read reviews that the powder left residue. Well, so does the gel. It also leaves my stainless steel looking dull and grimy. If I don't pre-wash, it doesn't clean well enough on its own to merrit continued use."
2,Halving my phosphate load,"I've tried varying the amount of this detergent, and adding a rinse aid, and neither step removed the problem of this detergent leaving a residue on my dishes. So, as a solution, I use this detergent as the prewash, and use a regular phosphate-containing dishwasher detergent for the main wash. Everything comes out completely clean and crystal clear. It's not the absolute elimination of phosphates that I'd hoped for, but it's a good first step until I can try the Method phosphate-free dish tablets (whenever Amazon will start carrying them!)"
1,Rusted all my silverware and metal utensils,"It's not going green, it's going rust. As soon as I started using it I noticed rust on my butter knives and my steak knives (two different types of knives and very expensive). I'd never seen that happen to my silverware before. Another wash turned up rusting my metal spatula. The next time my metal spoons were rusted. I stopped using 7th Generation and went back to Cascade and it never happened again. So much for going green."
1,Doesn't work,"I've used other Seventh Generation products and been generally satisfied with them. This dishwasher gel simply doesn't work, however. Half of the dishes would still be dirty. My dishes come out clean when using other brands of dishwasher detergent, so it isn't a problem with my dishwasher."
1,Not worth your money,Does not clean the dishes like the conventional dishwasher liquid used to. You have to reclean the dishes after they have been cleaned in the dishwasher. Would not recommend. I wish I didn't stock up on it :(
2,Can't be green to wash twice.,I used to use Cascade or whatever was cheap. I thought I'd try the supposedly green choice. Doesn't remove coffee stains from cups. Leaves film on dishes. I have to soak silverware so it comes clean. I use so much water prewashing the dishes that the Cascade has to be more enviro friendly in the end. I'm switching to something else. Glad I only had 1 bottle.
2,not so good,"This detergent did not remove food stains. It consistently left tea, coffee, chocolate, and almond milk residue when other standard powdered cleaners easily removed these food residues. I even put the glasses with the almond milk residue back in for another washing (and took a scrubber to them beforehand) and the residue is still there! My other cleaners outperform this gel by a long-shot! I have very hot water in my water heater and my dishes always came out sparkling with any other cleaner I've used."
5,LOVE!,"It feels great to be responsible when it comes to being ""green"" but Seventh Generation really makes it easy when they have such great products! I have fairly soft water where I live so I only have to use about 1/2 of a cup to wash a load of dishes. It works just as well as other name brand products without all the chemicals. AND if you use the subscribe and save feature the cost goes way down! Can't say enough good things about this product!"
1,Consumer Reports investigation...,"If it had not been for the following (9/07), I'd have given this a 3 rating. However, on an investigation of biodegradable ""green"" products, Consumer Reports wrote: (RE:) ""Biodegradable"" detergents. Seventh Generation Automatic Dishwashing Gel is said to break down in the environment. But the claim broke down when we found that the product contains a petroleum-derived agent that doesn't readily biodegrade. A spokeswoman said the company would remove the claim and review its product line and labeling. Biodegradability of two other detergents--Earth Friendly Product's Wave automatic dishwasher gel and Planet Ultra Dishwashing Liquid--was certified by reputable independent groups."""
2,not very good,"I switched from Electrasol to this hoping to be more environmentally friendly.This is awful, it doesn't clean nearly as well. There seem to be a film on everything and some food never comes off the plates.I'm not helping the environment if I have to run thing more than once, if I have to fill the dishwasher with too much detergent, or if I throw the whole thing away because it's a poor product. I'll grudgingly use this up but will never get again.I will try their powder product to see if that is any better but I'll buy a small amount locally and test it as opposed to a case of it at Amazon.Another thing I will try is the ecover brand, I hope something works better otherwise I'll go back to mainstream products.EDITI just tried ecover brand (also eco-friendly) and that works much much better."
4,Pretty good....,Make sure that you rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and this dishwasher gel will work just fine.
2,A disappointment and waste of money,"I bought the this product in an effort to be more green. My household has stopped using chemicals altogether for cleaning & I wanted to do that also with my dishwasher, etc. This product is a HUGE disappointment! In fact, I gave away the rest of my bottles because it doesn't work at all! There is always a residue left even when dishes have been rinsed thoroughly! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! I bought a box of Ecover @ Whole Foods to try out and it is doing a great job!"
1,DON'T waste your money,This is the worse dishwasher detergent that I have EVER used. I made myself finish one 45oz bottle and gave the other 5-bottles to a local shelter
2,Unfortunately didn't work,"I love most of the Seventh Generation products but unfortunately this did not work very well for us. Left a lot of food on dishes and we had to basically either wash the dishes before putting into dishwasher or run the dishwasher again. Defeats the purpose. I'll keep checking back, hopefully Seventh Generation will be able to improve on this. Scent was great however, not too overpowering."
2,Not happy with the residue,I don't like how this leaves a white residue on things. It's gotten to the point where I mix in a little bit of mainstream detergent just for its anti-spotting capabilities.
3,Not bad,"This detergent works well for cleaning the dishes but leaves a white residue behind. If you have dishes that don't collect water on the top, this product should be fine. If you have cups, glasses, etc that collect water on the top, then you will be disappointed with the white gunk leftover after the dishwasher completes its cycle."
5,cruelty-free and it works,"This is the only cruelty-free dishwasher detergent, of the many I have tried, that works.You do have to pre-rinse dishes and get off dried/baked residue before washing, and use hot water.Using Ecover Rinse Aid gets rid of spotting."
3,Eco-Friendly Dishwashing Liquid,Unfortunately this was damaged and never delivered. I have had to reorder. I wish amazon would automatically reship.
4,Works fine,"It leaves a thin film, but Cascade does the same thing in my dishwasher. I like this liquid a lot more than those packets. It cleans well, but I always pre rinse everything before I put it in the dishwasher."
2,Cleaning power not quite there,"Not as effective at cleaning dried on food as the ""non-environmental"" types....but usually OK if you rinse before putting dishes in the dishwasher.Was hoping it would be more powerful, but it seems to get that, you need those harsher ingredients."
1,Doesn't do the job,"I got a 6 pack of these which we've been using for months, and after we're through, I won't be buying any more of this detergent. Like others have said, Seventh Generation cleaners are usually quite effective, but every load of dishes we wash with the detergent comes out with a residue or just not clean. We have tried varying the amounts, using or not using the pre-rinse, hand rinsing dishes, doing smaller loads, and nothing seems to be effective. We do not have particularly hard or soft water, so this shouldn't be an issue at all.I was given some leftover Cascade tablets after a family trip, and seeing the difference side by side is particularly compelling. I'm not sure if there is a good non-petrol dish detergent out there, but the hassle of Seventh Gen is just not worth it.Short answer: steer clear."
3,So Far So Good - or is it?,"Susan Egan demonstrates wonderful vocal facility throughout this solo album and approaches each song with solid technique. Her voice is extremely pleasant and healthy. My biggest complaint about this album (and other solo albums produced by the same label) is that the songs are not personalized to the singer. The arrangements sound exaclty like they did on the original cast recordings when they were sung by someone else! I think it is so important that when a performer is talented and fortunate enough to be featured on a solo album it should be personalized to them. Susan sings each song beautifully but does not show ownership for the song. When I hear an album of this style ideally I should not want to hear any other person in the world sing the songs she does. Unfortunately, she sang them just like everyone else did. I hope that Susan's next album (which I would buy without hesitation) comes more from the heart and contains arrangements ESPECIALLY for her."
2,Very disappointed with this album,"I adore Susan Egan and the beautiful sound she captures however this particular album was a real disappointment to me. The songs were the same songs you find on most broadway albums. I was so hoping that Susan Egan would sing a mix of new with the old. I really love Susan Egan and hope she'll consider doing another album soon with songs that truly capture her soft, yet moving voice. I loved hearing Susan Egan perform in Adryan Russ's album ""Everyone Has a Story"" and was hoping that this album would be similar in nature."
5,"Beautiful voice, unique song seletion","Susan Egan's beautiful voice shines in this unusual collection of Broadway songs. I especially like It Might As Well Be Spring and I Know Him So Well. Susan has shown, on this CD and her other ones, that she can handle a variety of musical styles with equal ability and musicality. The production values on this CD and her Coffee House one are top notch.Also recommended: Faith Prince ""A Leap of Faith,"" Susan Egan ""So Far"" and ""Coffee House,"" Sally Mayes ""Story Time"""
3,Boring,"Somehow I managed to make it to the end of this book, skipping bits here and there. It was frustrating - a few of the characters were well-drawn - Aunt Julia and her mother, for example - but most were so bland it was hard to remember who was who.The setting, a hospital in Maine, was similarly frustrating. The hospital itself was well drawn. Maine could have been anywhere from Kansas to Utah if you threw in a coastline.I can usually identify with a female protagonist, but not this one, she was bland and featureless, her husband even more so. The plot, well, the writer doesn't bother with actual plot twists, she just throws in a few wierd events that don't relate meaningfully to anything and has everybody driving off in all directions. Finally the motivation. The one I hate most - he/she did it because he/she was crazy.Some humor or some attitude might have lifted this book out of the doldrums; it definitely isn't this writer's best work."
5,Most used,I am Portuguese and this was my first Portuguese cookbook. My family was amazed with our Sunday dinners. Even my mother-inlaw was impressed. The recipes were easily prepared and even the wine section helped me to pair the right dish with the right wine. I know my vavo would be proud.
4,Great cook book,"Being from Portugal myself, I find the recepies very authentic. As well as recepies from diferent zones of the country. Great work"
3,Food of Portugal,"When reading the description and reviews on this book, I thought it was going to be fantastic. It has some great recipes, but not what I expected. My mother-in-law is from the Azores and it does not have any of the traditional recipes that her or any of her friends/family grew up with. I guess my expections were not met because it doesn't have those ""warm"" home cooked meals I was expecting. I actually found a lack of chicken/beef recipes that my other cookbook has an abundance of. Over-all it is a great book for those interested in a cookbook with a sampling of Portuguese food and plenty of seafood recipes."
5,Delicious,A nice treat after a run. A good snack in a backpack. Will buy again. My family likes the peanut butter Nugo more which leaves me to deal with these on my own . . . .
5,Completely Addicted,"I bought a variety pack of these NuGo bars on a whim at Costco awhile back, and have pretty much been hooked on them every since then. I've never been a big fan of protein bars because they all have that same weird taste and consistency, but these bars are different. The chocolate flavor, in particular, tastes like you're eating a candy bar (as another reviewer mentioned) so you actually enjoy eating it instead of just eating it to fill your stomach. Since these bars do have a low glycemic index, I definitely notice that I don't get hungry as quickly as I do when I eat other things. I'm definitely addicted and am happy that Amazon sells boxes of these since I haven't been able to locate them in any local stores. Now if only they offered the ""Subscribe and Save"" option for these bars then I'd be all set."
1,bahar,"It is funny, I bought this bar outside and I love it, the one that they sent me taste old and I did not like it, I was busy otherwise I should return the product."
1,Quite Disappointed,"I recently purchased NuGo bars from Amazon because they were a little less expensive than buying them direct from the manufacture. Since it has chocolate in it I paid extra for expedited (chilled) delivery. I got 2 different deliveries, neither expedited or chilled, and because of the heat the glue from the wrapper on every bar I've opened up so far is sticking to the bar. Will never buy this product from Amazon.NuGo All-Natural Nutrition Bar, Peanut Butter Chocolate, 15 - 1.76-Ounce Bars"
1,Mediocre survey of gay and lesbian history,"Reads very much like a high school textbook on gay and lesbian studies. If you're savvy at all about GLBT issues, this book will add nothing to your knowledge."
3,Good Price + Good Fun = Great Value,Boys wanted a third Sea Monkey Aquarium. This time around we were looking for Sea Monkeys that change colors ( die in food - my guess). Have not noticed any changes yet.( 1 month or so in). The kit is complete and includes everything including the million bubble pump..
5,Do you want to touch my monkey?,"This is an above average sea monkey kit.For a few extra dollars you get a couple of good extras. The lighted tanks is pretty cool, and the sunken ship is just okay (mine didn't really glow in the dark and the mast was permanently all bent out of shape). I found the Sea Monkey eye-droppers particularly useful. You can use it to put bad monkeys into isolation or sacrifice them to the gold fish or whatever. You also get a couple of extra mystery sea-monkey packages. Despite the reassuring directions, I'm not really sure that they do anything. However, the purple one really doesn't add any flavor to a double latte.Go ahead and buy this one. Have fun with your monkeys."
3,Great fun...until they lose interest,"My daughter, 9, a real nature lover, was thrilled to get this and put it together. It takes patience to finally see the results. But the tiny shrimp were very cute once we saw them (a little longer than when manufacturer stated). The shrimp grew rapidly and were easy to care for. The ship however looked pretty gnarly a couple of weeks with stagnant water. We also ran out of food and had a hard time finding food. This would make a nice gift for a science crazy kid AND if you live where you can find supplies. My own daughter was amused for awhile. Get it on sale and its worth the price."
3,sea monkeys alive,"It worked just as it was supposed to. fallowing the instructions, life is almost instant. the only real flaw is that if you stirr and suck the creatures to often they can die.but as it says on the package, wait for the water to evaporate and they will return to life when you refill the tank."
2,Ghostly Galleon - Sea Monkeys,"Product was delivered extremely quickly, 5 days after making additional shipping payment that was requested by the seller. Packaging was well-done and intact. Overall, fairly pleased with service. Disappointed that sea monkeys did not last for 2 years, our sea monkeys died after 1 & half months because they needed much more oxygen than what was recommended (using million bubble air pump). They need a motor air pump instead."
2,Poor performance,"As a big fan of Gubaidulina, I needed to hear this work but the performance is so poor that I doubt if any idea of what this work is like can be gained. The same is true for the Gorecki."
4,Useful and Not Tacky!,"Since I have multiple sets of headphones and a phone headset with a cord, buying three cord managers in one made sense. Because this product is not in the shape of something silly like a rabbit or fish, the cord manager doesn't look tacky. It's simple, keeps my headphones from getting tangled or catching on things, and the price is inexpensive."
4,does what it said it would do,it works just as how the description said. i like the colors. the only drawback was it can be somewhat heavy and yank my earbuds out of my ears. other than that they are very good at keeping the wire in place.
3,just not right for me,This product works as intended. I thought I would like to have my headphones wrapped but this type doesn't work for me. The cord tends to stay in the small loops after removed from the smartwrap. And it just isn't convenient to wrap and unwrap so many times.
4,What? It's a skunk? Don't overthink it.,"I am not a collector of Ty Beanie Babies, but my impression of them over the years has been that they are relatively durable and possess reasonably good detail work. This one was no exception."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,I never ever write negative reviews but this product is by far the worst I have ever bought. I ordered 2 and was sent 11 and now I know why! It's a very cheaply made product that is barely glued and every single one of them ripped apart while I was trying to use it in my daughter's hair. Biggest waste of money I have spent. Do not buy these unless you want to just give your money away!
4,nice profile,"This plugged in to my Sirius unit (old one, but was not a problem, thanks to the unchanged connector) and provided the expected signal. Works as expected. Has a shallow body, which is nice."
5,big dog in sky,this is a hard to find item. it is a better quality than the one that come with the radio. very good value
4,Sirius 14105 Car Antenna,works so far. I only have it on the dash. Not the best reception there but I plan to move it outside anyway
2,Works some of the time,"There is definitely a problem with this antenna. I don't know if it's the overall design or a problem with the unit I received. I almost never get full signal strength with this antenna while I always get full strength with antennas on my other cars. Usually the strength is 1/2 or lower and driving underneath even a canvas awning will kill the signal. I also tried my other Sirius receiver with this antenna and it, too, received only 1/2 signal strength. I plan to purchase another one locally so I can test it right away and swap it if there's a problem."
1,Didn't Receive what I had Ordered.,I had ordered the Direct D antenna from Amazon with 6th Ave as the third party supplier. When my product arrived I observed that what I received was not what I had ordered. Instead I received an antenna that I could not even use with my Starmate 4. After several phone calls and Emails I was finally given a return shipping slip to send it back. Thanks Amazon!
1,Failed after 2 days.,"Lasted 2 days before getting 'No Antenna' message. There were nocuts in the wire, it was properly installed according to the manual.Just up and died on me."
3,mild reception,"This antenna works, but not always as well as one would like. It is smaller than the original car antenna for this Audiovox product and one wonders if its diminutive size costs something in the quality of its reception."
4,Much better than original antenna,"I don't know what the deal is with Sirius antennas. Only after my original antenna died did i realize how many people have had the same problems as I did. I keep this new antenna on my dashboard so it doesn't receive any unnecessary abuse from weather, and i still get great reception! If you need a replacement, this antenna is a safe bet."
5,Great signal!,This item is amazing. My Sirius signal went way up as compared to their factory antenna.
3,mixed bag,"while i love sirius radio, thier equipment and customer service are poor. i have replaced this antenna 3 times in 1 year. and while they work good for a while they eventually go bad. i have 3 radios and each one has had antenna problems. customer service from sirius is of little help."
2,WEAK,"Great researching by Tillman didn't guarantee a great book, just a bunch of data put together. The appendix in the end are the best part. Reading it back-to-cover is impossible."
5,A great end to an inspiring trilogy,"Nora Roberts strikes Irish gold once again with this last of the ""Born"" trio. While I wondered how this unknown Concannon, Shannon Bodine, would be worked into the tightly knit fabric of Maggie and Brianna's family and village, the portrayal of Shannon as she loses and then finds herself is enthralling. Ms. Roberts perfectly catches the emotions Shannon feels -- shock, betrayal, denial, confusion, anger, passion -- during her life-changing moments... it were as if Ms. Roberts had consulted with a psychologist for the range of emotions someone like Shannon would feel. The romance with Murphy Muldoon and Shannon's discovery of her Irish soul will keep you reading from cover to cover."
4,Irish twist,"Roberts turns her prime character, Shannon Bodine's life upside down when on Shannon's mother's deathbed, she reveals a different father than the one who raised her and two step sisters living in Ireland. Brought up in Midwest America, this revelation comes as a shock. Bewildered and a little angry at the well kept secret, Shannon adheres to her mother's dying wish and travels to the small town in Ireland where her newly acquired step sisters live.Some of history repeats itself and Shannon falls in love with an Irishman as well as siblings and a family she never knew. The Irish setting was a nice twist."
4,Born in Shame,Great story line - as always. I especially like trilogies and this book lived up to my expectations.Nora I love your books
4,An Interesting Book of Irish Life,"Following reading the second book of a trilogy, Born in Fire by Nora Roberts, I knew I wanted to read the first and third books. Even though I have not completed reading this book, I am thoroughly enjoying it. Nora Roberts writes books of love, and relationships between family and friends. The Born in Ice, Fire, and Shame triology is set in Ireland and has a wonderful descriptions of Irish life."
4,Great series,"I've found with Nora Roberts that I can only read the trilogies. The stand alones a redundant, nothing special, same ol' same ol'. The trilogies are where the meatier stories are. This was one of the trilogies that I truly enjoyed reading from start to finish.If you're new to Nora Roberts, or you're feeling like giving up on her, give this series a try."
5,Excellent story,Nora Roberts is a great writer and I always enjoy her stories. Of the three stories in this series this is my favorite. I would love to see a follow up and find out where these characters go on to. There is a bit of magic but not too much. I read this one over and over whenever I can.
3,Well written but dissappointing,"Here is what I liked about this book: The writing style and also the dynamic between the tree sisters. However, the whole romance was based on a very limited and strict ""love at first sight"" idea that basically undermines the real and deep love that can only be achieved through knowledge of your lover. It was like a very naive 13 years old and a very mature woman have written this book together. Don't even get me started on all the sex-with-no-condoms scenes that had me cringing instead of enjoying them."
2,COULD HAVE SKIPPED THIS ONE---,"There were many things I didn't enjoy about this book. The characters were flat and not extremely likable. The story was boring, predictable, and unrealistic. The flashbacks detracted from what little was there and the timing for the whole book was off. The hero was telling the heroine after only being in her company a few hours that he loved her and wanted to marry her??? A supposed reason was given toward the end of the book, but by that time I couldn't care less."
4,My favorite in the Triology,I guess this is my favorite because I was already familar with the characters. I love how the sisters (Maggie & Brianna) are a huge part of the story in this book although we learned so much about them in the other two books.The romance between Shannon and Murphy is the kind that Irish legends are made of. Fiery and Mystical.
3,Missing Something,"Overall this was a pretty good book, but it wasn't quite up to the other books in the series. I really liked the two main characters, Shannon and Murphy (expecialy Murphy). There was an OK plot, ending the little mystery of what happend to Amanda and her unborn child. There was even a bit of the supernatural thrown in. Unfortunatly I felt that the story was a little weak. It seemed like this story was just sort or written up quick to finish off the series. I'd hoped to see somthing a little better for Murphy, and a little more of him for that matter. He didn't seem to be around a whole lot. Even though I didn't find this story to be quite as good as the others I still recomend that you read it."
4,Solid and Good,"Born in Shame is the third book in the 'Born In...' series, which features Shannon Bodine and Murphy Muldoon.Born in Shame is a solid ending to the 'Born In...' series and wraps things up very nicely. It wasn't one of my favorites of the trilogy, and honestly I found Shannon irritating after having read Maggie's and Brie's stories.But! I did love the story surrounding Shannon, and Murphy, and tying the loose ends. All trilogies should end as satisfying as this one does."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I usually enjoy Roberts' stories-despite the fact that she tends to recycle her plots and characters. Anyway, of the three books in the trilogy, Born in Shame is my least favourite. The heroine, Shannon, is rather unappealing. She lacks Maggie's spirit and Brianna's sweetness. Murphy, the hero, is great, but I just kept thinking, he's too good for her. The supernatural/mythical elements in the story are kind of silly. Roberts does a much better job of weaving them into her other, more recent, Irish trilogy. Roberts has written some memorable romances, but this is not one of them."
3,Born In Shame,"Shannon Bodine lived a charmed life until she found out that her life was based on a lie. Her mother had an affair with a married man, and the man she had always loved as a father, wasn't her natural parent. Since her mothers last wish was for her to seek out the family she never knew, Shannon heads to Ireland.When she meets Brianna and Maggie's neighbor Murphy Muldoon, they find an unexpected connection and immediate attraction. He had been dreaming of Shannon for as long as he could remember, and knew they were destined to be. Shannon was a painter, and Murphy loved his little piece of country life. He didn't know how they could intertwine their lives, but knew she was a part of him.I wasn't impressed with the flashbacks and past life twists. Overall the characters lacked the development I expect."
2,Third and Final Book,"This was the third and final book in the series Born and the fourth and final book of Nora Roberts that I will read. The character Murray was not very developed and the whole broach thing was rather outrageous - did Murray believe he and Shannon were reincarnated lovers from the past? The very last chapter when Shannon did her final speech all I read was blah blah blah and was glad this book was over. At least Grayson was a bit more likeable in this book, even though we didn't see him much."
4,Born in shame The born trilogy # 3,"This was the last book of this series and i have to say it was a hard book at first to get into, but i kept reading it trying to get into character and as soon as Shanon hit Ireland i was into the book and couldn't put it down! The fact that Murphy falls in love was so exciting. out of all three books this one made me cry!! i recommend this series to anyone who is seeking a true love story."
2,once again spectre makes a crappy product,"it looks good and seems to work ok but after a month the 2 black o rings get brittle and fall off. this happened to my radiator cap, power steering cap and bolt caps with the o rings."
2,Get what you pay for...,Really flimsy material but I am not going to return the item. I suppose it's working but next time I will spend a bit more and get a more durable filter.
1,READ THIS,"I wouldn't purchase this product if I were you. The reasons are simple, insufficient instructions, lack of customer/technical support(unless you are a dealer) and the product was defective out of the box."
3,Collection of 8th AF Combat Reports.,"Aviation historian Bill Hess' latest book is basically a collection of combat reports filed by top 8th AF aces like Don Blakeslee, Francis Gabreski, Don Gentile, Duane Beeson, Robin Olds, Dave Schilling, George Preddy and others supplemented with mini-bios and photos of the pilots and their aircraft.If you are an adrenaline junky, look no further - the combat reports take you into the heart of action. If you want more, you will have to look elsewhere because that is basically all the book has to offer.In short, the book is enjoyable but a lightweight. An optional purchase."
4,If you enjoyed The Red Tent...,"Definitely on the same page as The Red Tent-biblical fiction from a woman's point of view (in this case two women). Enjoyed the story; especially Tziporrah's. I found Miryam too arrogant and full of herself. I've never read the Old Testament version of Exodus, although I'm familiar with the story. Was Moses so self-absorbed and angry? Was Yahveh (God) as punishing, angry and unforgiving as portrayed in this book? As a Jew, I would hate to believe so. These two last mentioned portrayals were the only things that ruined this book for me. Otherwise, the writing and dialogue were easy to follow and the characters well- developed. An easy and fast read-I recommend."
4,Definitive collection of 'thrax!!!,"I was looking for a nice sort of ""best of"" from Anthrax,and this exceeded my expectations!!! If you looking for the same,Get THIS SET!!!"
4,Great,Great collection but the CD packaging is bad. The hinges on the insert tray broke the first time i flipped it over to get at the second disc.
4,It's old school Antrax!!,"If you liked the Joey days, you'll like having all the old tunes re-mastered and sounding better than ever. I did enjoy this cd for what it is, however truth be told, I much prefer Jon Bush as their frontman as his voice is a thousand times better than Joey's ever was.Pick up The Greater of Two Evils as it features classic Anthrax tunes done right and while your at it, pick up We've Come for You All and Sound Of White Noise. All of these are awesome cd's from a band that has gotten no credit over the years."
3,Jump Start 1st grade math work book,"Cute book, but seemed geared pretty low for 1st grade, not very challenging at all, I'm sort of disappointed. Might be good for the very beginning of 1st grade, by be 2nd semester kids ought to be way past this."
2,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered this as a Christmas present. It took considerably longer to ship than expected and when it arrived it was a chuhuahua mat instead of a jack russell. ""Protected by CHUHUAHUA"" and a little image of that breed. I may try to return the item but it's too close to Christmas to get the order fixed in time for it to be the gift it was intended as."
5,Wonderfully refreshing...even if recycled.,"Blind masseur and master swordsman Zatoichi finds a robbed and fatally wounded pregnant woman. Of course, he ends up delivering the baby and, sure enough, she dies - being fatally wounded. He takes the baby in search of its family, which as you know is the plot of a third of the movies by now, and finds the child's aunt. The problem is she is about to be forced into prostitution for want of money. Money the dead mother was bringing. Zatoichi, of course, does not have the money, but nobody believes him. And the beat goes on.Better than most of the films, not because of the plot, as much as the fast paced action and touch of humor that pops up here and there. As you can see from some of the other reviews, this film, number 23(?) in the series has regained some of the energy and spark of the earlier films."
3,IS NOT the best Zatoichi movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Here are good things and bad things:Good:* Beautiful colors.* Awesome song when Zatoichi is fighting 40 men.* Zatoichi is surrounded by fire.Bads:* HORRIBLE fight choreoghraphy.* NO action until the ending.* Fast final fight.* Zatoichi gets hit by a bunch of normal people.Adios.
5,Very Pleased,"I was very happy with my purchase- everything was of good quality and the price was unbelievable... I looked at just a case for my phone at AT&T which was not pleasing to the eye and they wanted 29.95 just for that - I got all the accessories, (with exception of the memory card) for about 1/2 the price of just the case at the AT & T store. The clear case is great and looks great on the phone, now I have an extra charger as well as the car charger and the cord to download updates etc from the internet- Great Buy- Very Pleased."
2,"good graphics, REALLY bad gameplay","my title says it all. thank god i rented this game instead of buying it. the only reason i gave this game 2 stars is because of the graphics. when the demo first came out on xbox live marketplace, i gave it a try and the gameplay was horrible. when this game was released i gave it a rent. i played for about 1 hour, then took it back the next day. i really tried my best to like this game. take my advice, if you want to give this game a try then rent before you buy."
2,Hour of Victory,"This game is terrible. I was looking forward to a new name in World War II shooters, but this is just more of the same done worse. The controls were a little annoying, but you'd get used to them. Graphics are no where near as good as they were saying they would be. Missions were boring and character specialties (Sniping, stealth etc.) were more a nuisance then a fun addition to the genre. I'd suggest picking up Call of Duty 2, its half the price and at least 5 times as good."
1,terrible game,"This game is aweful. The AI sucks, the gameplay sucks, the graphics arent great, the controls suck. It is dry and boring. This is the quality game of something you would find in a bargain bin for under ten dollars, and I'm sure it won't be long before it ends up there. With all the great shooters out (and coming out) I would highly reccommend to all gamers to stay away from Hour of Victory."
1,terrible,"This game is horrible, I can't belive I wasted 20 minutes of my life and 60 dollars playing this! don't buy!"
2,"Not as bad as said, but that doesnt make it good.","Hour of Victory is an FPS that tries out the whole diversity with the characters pitch, and the awesomely derivative dialogue. The game is basically a weak FPS, with no real point and sense of what it wants to be, with that said, it still does have some value. You can get some easy achievements, and it only cost me $12, so no real loss. Basically, this game is a very linear, short, and generic FPS. If you see it for cheap maybe buy it, but dont expect anything great."
2,hi,i need help i got the game today and the game said this disc's region code is incorrect for this console?????????????i have the new xbox 356 black 250 gig...
3,hour of victory,the game isn't the best ever but good deal for $20. Fun if you liked call of duty. Although game IS trash dont buy borrow from a friend. Is quite entertaing though because of brain dead AI
1,Not worth it,Didn't really like it.. Certainly not what i thought it was going to be. The graphics and game play kinda sucked...
1,COULDNT RUN IT IN MY XBOX,I was never able to play it as it is not recognized by my Xbox Region... WTF... Its been several years since you had region codes for DVD and CDs. It seems to be a great game Love all related to WWII. Its a shame!Vendors and Amazon should write in the specs if game or SW is restricted with region codes!!! I HAVE READ ALL THE BOX AND SEE NO DISCLAIMER! Shame on you!!!!
3,Lousy outfit,Ordered the unit but when it arrived it was DOA. Called to return it and was told they would ship me out a new one right away. Called after 2 weeks and instead of sending a new one was told they would repair it but had not even looked at it yet. Finally got it back 3 weeks later and besides that it cost me $22.50 to ship it back to them. I'd never do business with them again.
5,buck and a quarter? FIVE STAR!,"I use it for band rehearsal as part of my vocal P.A. and it works fine. I was skeptical of both the price and the fact they market hisonic stuff as Kereoke gear. I had shopped the music stores for powered monitors and the closest thing I found to the Hisonic was a Beringer at 300 bucks, which is nothing to say of the Yamaha and Mackie stuff at around $700. All I can say is for 125 bucks this baby is great! does'nt sound particularly good but if you're tight $ this baby is a godsend."
4,great adventure story,The chalk box kid is a great adventure story. I recommend this book for a first to second grader. It is a good book for a boy or girl.
4,Who Needs Seeds To Create A Garden?!,"Written by LukeYou will really enjoy this book.This story is about a nine year old named Gregory. He loved painting. One day his assignment at school was to make a garden. He decided to make one out of chalk because he had a concrete backyard.His whole school loved his drawings and he went from having no friends, to having many friends.This story can teach you how to do things differently and to follow your passion."
5,Wonderful book for kids!,"This book about Gregory tells how a child learns to express himself and win the admiration of his family, teachers and classmates. We have a copy for each of our second graders and use it as a reader. ...."
5,Love Haku so much,"I like all the tracks in this album, especially Haku, I must have listend to it thousands of time~My favorite CD of them."
5,George Foreman GR36P Grill,"I love this grill. It is so good to cook bacon and other meats, reheat meats, and grilled cheese sandwiches. It is easy to keep clean."
5,love this grill,I love this grill. Cleans up nicely. Cooks great. Wish it had on/off switch instead of unplugging it. Used it twice with no problem. I would recommend this product!
4,"It cooks evenly and dependably, but it makes too much noise","I used a small Foreman grill faithfully throughout college. It was the best, most efficient way to cook my endless stream of turkey burgers and chicken breasts.I upgraded to a larger version when I graduated, since I had less time to cook on a daily basis. The idea is that I can cook in larger batches and refrigerate the food until I need it.The larger grill cooks a bit slower, which is expected. What is unexpected, and is pretty darn annoying, is the constant clicking noise the unit makes, like a large relay shutting on and off. But it happens even after I unplug the unit, so maybe it is something to do with expansion / contraction of the metal tray. Whatever the case, it's extremely annoying.I'd still buy Foreman products again if this one crapped out. The slanted drip design is too useful to pass up. But I hope they fix the noise in future versions."
3,Poor sound quality and a lot of dialog.,"As the title suggests, there is a lot of dialog from the original cartoon, so it's not something to listen to in the office. There are tw o songs that made it worth buying though."
3,"Hey! They redact ""Boil That Dustspeck!""","One of the tensest -- and most memorable -- moments in all of ""Horton"" comes shortly after Horton has been ""roped and caged"", and they're about to submerge Horton's clover -- dust speck and all -- into ""a hot steaming kettle of beezlenut oil"" --""Boil that dustspeck! Boil that dustspeck! Boil that dustspeck!Boil! Boil! Boil! Boil!Beezlenut! (Rah! Rah!) Beezlenut! (Rah! Rah!)Beezlenut! (Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!) Beezlenut OIL!""On this CD you can JUST catch the start of this memorable chant -- but they quickly fade it out! How disgusting!So I've been forced to give this (otherwise memorable) CD only three stars instead of five. Boo-hoo."
2,terribly distorted sound,"I love the music/story, but the sound is awful! No one else finds this? Perhaps it's only the case with the MP3 download version, but I will be complaining to Amazon immediately![UPDATE]: Actually, there was something technically wrong with my wireless network and the sound is fine. I tried changing the stars to 5-stars, but can't seem to do so!- rob"
3,Made the kids happy,"It was a Christmas present from Santa. A nice size but too thin. It was almost see thru. Never the less, the kids were happy with it and very excited to use it to get cozy and watch movies on the couch."
5,Perfect Transaction.,This item was exactly in the condition as described and arrived just when they said it would. It was a perfect transaction.
1,Disappointed.,I am very upset and disappointed. I ve done a lot of shopping with amazon with no problems until this product. When I opened the box it was not the same pattern/style I had ordered or wanted. It's a Christmas gift so I don't have time to return the item. It was not what I ordered nor what my confirmation e mail showed.
3,"Very thin, but nice. Not worth the price.","I ordered this throw for my husband, a big UGA fan. It is super thin. Kind of like the $5 throws you can get at the dollar store. I don't think it was worth the $17 I paid for it. The design is nice, though."
1,Lead Warning for this Blanket,"I returned this blanket. It looked nice but then I saw a warning attached that said something to the effect- this product contains lead levels that can cause birth defects, cancer, please wash hands after handling. REALLY? it is a blanket, of course it will be handled. I sent it back immediately."
1,NOT what I ordered!,I ordered this for my boyfriend for V-day. It's not what I got. I got something completely different in design. Beware!!! I wanted what was pictured and not what was sent!!! I was expecting a solid burgundy fleece blanket with one gold bobcat and instead got a burgundy fleece blanket with a greenish bobcat and big TEXAS STATE lettering.
1,disappointed,"Bought this throw for my son for Christmas after he placed it on his Wish List.Very disappointing. It is VERY thin for the price, plus it has a warning that it contains lead. Who wants lead on their throw?Only good thing was the logo and striping. Returning it!"
4,"quite good, though some assumptions are quite annoying","This is extremely interesting read, often quite hillarious and hard to beleive (or maybe not - not the first and not the last time that medical profession overlooks the obvious and displays extreme ignorance on human, especially female, body). However, I didn't like author's attitude that a woman cannot have an orgasm without clitoral stimulation. This may, unfortunately, be true for some women, but my own experience tells me that this is not entirely true, and that there are many ways to achieve orgasms, and none of them should be considered inferior to other ways."
5,"How female bodies really work, and its just fine!","There was an irony and sadness to the truth that in the face of immense male denial of women's actual sexual physical workings in intimate relationships and in male psychological advice, there was this actual historical presence of awareness by male physicians of how our bodies work, albeit at such an unintimate distance it almost can't count as awareness. It was as if our bodies were like machines.Great research. Essentail reading for everyone."
4,tough read but worth it,"okay so as a lay person this was a bit of a tough read, however it was worth it. It's not just the history of the vibrator but on how we as a culture have evolved our views on sex, female sexuality and masterbation. Eye opening, it made me examine so of the views I hold and ask why, and thats always good in a book."
4,don't put these in the lower rack of your dishwasher,"be careful, these melt fast if they go flying around your washer. I find these things useful but very hard to clean"
5,THE BEST DVD IN MY LIBRARY!,This is awesome. The video is so clear you feel as though you are on the stage. It has a fantastic feature that lets you change camera angles to view different musicians on the stage. If you have dolby digital decoding you are in for a real treat. The sound is better than the video and the video had me in awe. It is a must buy.
4,"Good concert, poor sound","I bought this DVD becouse of 5 stars. Of course i like DMB, so i buy it from Amazon. When i start to watch this DVD i was disappointed. DMB did a great job on the stage, but sound quality on this DVD is AWFUL. DD5.1 have no clarity and details. It lacks of power. The vocals also doesn't sounds clean. The man who mixed DD on this product, have to learn a lot. He spoiled this otherwise great concert. He must see Eric Claptons-One More Car One More Rider DVD. The picture quality is good. I rate this DVD 5 stars to DMB and 3 star to quality of this DVD."
4,Boyd shines,"The latest live effort by these fabulous five performers, is immpressive to say the least. I hels out buying the cd when it was first release. Although the DVD was not released (while the VHS edition was) i waited hoping it would soon be. My waiting paid off,and here is the visually stunning, absolutly rockin' show! MY only complaint come from the fact that the disk is not masterd in dolby Digital, these feature is sorly missed and is the reason it does not get a fifth star. The johnny cash song ""long black veil"" also once performed by the Cheiftans, and Boyd singing ""true reflections"" shows some exellent choices in shaking up the increasingly stale concert selection by the DMB. I feel they need to hurry up with some new material cause we've heard it all and love it, here's more to overplay. Here's a shout out to my baby sis Lizzy....Peace, 5000, Yeah."
3,"Good Music, slow pace","Now, given that this was one of their earlier performances, they did a good job.. I mean no matter what they play, DMB is great. I personally thought that this performance was too slow paced, I like more action, like the central park concert.. that was freaking great."
3,Great Picture / Weak Sound,"The DMB was excellent. The film footage was done very well. I was not impressed by the recording quality. The heavy parts of songs ( All band members wailing away) were not very crisp. Nor were any parts of this disk for that matter. I have experienced this with some lower quality DVD's, but I was suprised to find this on a disk as new as this one. Check out James Taylor on his DVD in 5.1 and you will hear what I am talking about. The DMB performance deserves 5 stars, the people that mixed the sound on the DVD deserve 0 stars."
4,I was there,"I think that the it was awesome to be able to watch a full length concert from my own home. I drove seventeen hours to see that concert and it was awesome. The setlist was great. The only thing about the video that i didn't like was that they didn't show dave dance enough, and they didn't show the spectacular light show that was going on enough."
5,"DMB, BACK AT IT AGAIN","WELL I SAW DAVE AT HERSHEY PA ON AUG 4TH, 37TH ROW, SEAT 42, SECTION D,AND HE WAS SO AWESOME. IT WAS LIKE I COULD FEEL HIM BREATHING ON ME LIKE HE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I GOT THE SAME VIBE FROM LISTENER SUPPORTED. I FELT LIKE I WAS THERE, THEY ALL JAM SO WELL! ITS GREAT FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS MUSIC!"
3,Not as good as it could have been...,"This video is for the diehard DMB fan only. You won't find any greatest hits here, save for a few. This video doesn't fully represent what a DMB concert is all about. Going by this video alone, it looks more like a boring lounge act."
4,Like Dave Matthews? BUY THIS NOW!,"Dave Matthews Band is one of the most musically diverse and talented 'rock' bands in existance. I saw them live from the third row in May of 1998 in Salt Lake City, and I thought I would never feel that sort of excitement again. I was wrong. Listener Supported DVD put me right on the stage with the band. The best feature of the disc is the availability to change camera angles between band members at will. The film is good quality, and I thought I would get the performance in widescreen, but it isn't. The DVD does however feature Dolby Surround 5.1, which is a different twist if you're used to how the stereo audio CDs sound. All in all, this a great DVD for home theater/rock music lovers."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,A must have DVD. I am listening to it as I write this review. I cannot count how many times I have watched or just listened to it while doing something else. I have never been to one of there concerts but after watching this DVD I have to see them.
5,Do You like music....,"....then you'll like this. Turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and enjoy. This is a band of immensely talented musicians, that can get into an extended jam which immerses you. 2 Hours and 20 minutes goes by rapidly, each song presenting a new landscape to get lost in."
5,As good as being there.,I went to the actual concert and the video is just as awesome. It was a great show and the energy is successfully captured in this video. Dave and the band are amazing and the crowd is really into it. I love watching the video because it reminds me so much of actually being at the concert.
4,It's DAVE!!!,"All the performances on here are, unsurprisingly, excellent in both musicianship and showmanship. Dave Matthews is an engaging performer that relies on his down-to-earth persona to bring another dimension to his great, life-affirming songwriting."
3,Dueling Academics,"Gordon adds significant insight into this period of Beckett's life, and her book details the times and environment very well. However, I can't help but think that her primary reason for writing it (other than to publish rather than perish) is a personal vendetta against Bair. She seems determined to demolish the latter's biography, point by point. Worth reading anyway."
4,Helped me out!,I have been a fan of tarot cards for many years and this book helped me learn even more about reading the cards.
1,bad contents,"Twice I have ordered things from 3 dog bakery and items have been smashed when received.They were nott boroken in shiping, they were sent out like this.Will never buy from again & neither will my friends and family.We complained and never even got a sorry.Too big for their bridges!!!!"
4,Fun but seemed too short.,I've had this sitting on my shelf for some years but was too busy to have originally played it. It was fun to play but it didn't seem long enough for my taste. Maybe I'm just spoiled a little by playing it later than when it had came out and games have gotten longer over time. BUt that's why I can't give it a 5.
4,Hell of a hellishly good game,"I went through my old Video games, weeding out those destined for trade in at Bookman's. I saw this one and remembered liking it, so I threw it back in and played it through. I forgot how much fun this game was and highly recommend a re-try to those FPS freak out there. I mean, you can get this game dirt cheap now, and it is a total blast!!!My only beef is, you have to play it through in order to use the cheat available and many of us play a game once and that's it.Other than that, not a single complaint. This game freaking rocks! Tons of different monsters/foes, tons of cool weapons, level upon level of varying backgrounds. Too me back to the old days of all the Doom games.So, if you're feeling nostalgic and want to play an FSP that doesn't require you to evolve three extra fingers on each hand, dig this one back up or buy it dirt cheap here on Amazon. You won't regret it."
2,"Pretty good, but too short.","I've always liked first-person games, going all the way back to Tunnel Runner for the Atari 2600, and have several for various videogame systems. This game was pretty good, but I conquered it in just over 2 weeks. I expect much more longevity. I got much more gameplay from Doom and Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown."
1,Not even worth it,I bought this mainly from all of the good comments here. I was sadly dissapointed when I played the game. All it is is running around shooting things with pretty lame weapons. There's nothing to really figure out and there's not even anything really interesting to look at. There's only one path through the game.. how stupid is that? One person likened it to Metal of Honor which I also have... it is NOTHING like Metal of Honor... that's actually a very good game with alot of thought behind it... this thing looks like it was slapped together in a few hours by the developers... In other words - don't buy it... get Metal of Honor instead... you'll be glad you did.
5,"Death, Destruction and Mayhem","WOW!!! This game is by far one of the best games I've played for the Playstation! If you enjoy shooting evil creatures (and I don't mean Fred Durst), then this game is for you. Great graphics, awesome gameplay, and a plethora of weapons for releasing the animal inside. No need to worry about the flowers and jumping plumbers in this one, folks...this is a total carnage fest, with a lot of strategy thrown in. BUY IT!!!!"
3,Sun Salutations - I love the feeling!,"I am finally able to follow my yoga instructor's advice in doing some Sun Salutations each day. I am not quite up to the number of repetitions that Dawn Holst recommends.I like that there are 3 variations offered, however, it would have been nice if after a variation, I was brought back to the main menu where I could easily replay the variation for however many repetitions I am interested in doing during one session."
4,Wonderful!,"I'm part native american, and I have long, coarse, thick curly brunette hair. Curly native american hair is hard to cater to, as the curls don't have a natural shape and easily frizz. My hair is still frizzy, but it also has a very natural shine and it's left my hair without a single tangle unlike any other product I've ever used. This isn't a cure all product but it's made flat ironing and blow drying my hair ten times easier. I was especially happy to find out that they DO NOT test on animals and this product is cruelty free [:I bought a 5 pack of the 8fl oz bottles at Wal*Mart for a cheap price. I transferred them into a spray bottle to make it easier to coat my hair and added rose oil to counter the earthy smell. The earthy smell isn't caused by the placenta, but by whatever fragrance they added.Pros: Leaves a natural shine, cheap, untangles curls, leaves hair feeling soft, no animal testing/cruelty!Cons: Earthy fragrance, animal product"
2,migrane relief,It seemed great at first but then it doesn't seem to do much for me anymore. And i only tried it maybe 15 times in all
1,Horrific,A good idea gone bad with terrible editing confusing instructions and an overall waste of time and a great contributor to frustration.Most of the time you are left hanging not understanding how or why with key points left out. Either teach step by step or don't attempt. What an unholy mess.
3,Frustration,"The idea and principle of a step by step guide to something as complex as Office2000 is necessary and desirable. Especially when compared with the endless dry tomes that tell you all the neat things you can do without step by step instructions and exercises, such as the horrific attempts at writing of Ron Mansfield and his books on Word.This book is very helpful but ogten maddening with numerous typos that leave you hanging, and poorly explained procedures especialy in complex functions such as in Excel which expect you to fill in blanks and intuit some of the exercises.The idea, concept and layout are sound and the tech support has been mercifully very helpful, but this edition could use extensive rewriting and editing."
2,The Good News and The Bad News,"I taught classes of adults with this book. I had many complaints about the fact that it was difficult to follow. Some of the exercises were ambiguous and some were over wrought with typing. It did have poor planning on the organizational side. While it built on the previous exercises, sometimes it was ambitious on some items and lacking on others. A similar amount of time was spent on 'opening' a document as was spent on creating a 'table.' On the positive side, if you already know what you are doing, it was easy to follow. If you already know what you are doing, you probably don't need this book."
5,A life-saver.,"This book was a real life-saver for me, and I know it's good enough to be used in some computer prep courses in high schools around here. This is the third DDC book I've used, and all three have been great. They're not flashy, but their step-by-step style actually makes it easier and faster to learn for the average person. Yes, there are some typos and glitches here and there, but they're hardly the prohibitive stumbling blocks the other reviews seem to suggest. I'd not be afraid to buy it. And some of DDC's other stuff--like the other two titles I got on Word and Access--is MOUS Certified BY MICROSOFT and will (I hope!) get me ready for the MOUS Certification exam."
2,Not real secure,I wasn't very happy with this. The snaps seem to pop open very easily with minimal readjustment. I honestly wish I would have returned it. I ended up getting the minotaur by comp-tac. I have been extremely happy with that purchase. I definitely wouldn't have named this holster 'summer comfort' either. More like 'pain in the butt'. Do yourself a favor and get a hybrid by either comp-tac or crossbreed. There are plenty of videos showing the advantages on youtube.
5,Our favorite pacifiers!,These are great! I love them because they have the clear outer area. THe frosted ones are my second favorite but I hate the pacifiers that have so much color that all you see is this big plastic thing on their face. At least with these the color area is small.... and we like that it doesn't have the loop that can be pulled out more easily.
4,My boots,"Today I recieved my Dukes Boots, and they are pretty cool. The sportsman's guide made the delivery ""unclear"", but they arrived a day before expected and they are so comfy!! One thing was that when I bought them, I bought a men's 7, and recieved a men's 6, women's 7. This turned out to work out because that I am a girl and would have liked women's more than men's but I would send them back if they had majorly messed up. Overall, I love my new boots."
2,Not the best I've read.,"This book was just fine until the author began a detailed description of a pirate battle that took place in the early 1700's. When she wrote about pirates shooting their ""revolvers"", I completely lost interest. It is pretty common knowledge that revolvers did not come into being until the mid 1800's, when Sam Colt invented the concept by, ironically, observing a ship's helm (wheel) in action. This historical inaccuracy was enough to turn me off to this book, and calls into question the validity of the remaining research contained therein."
4,Very good general overview of pirates,"This is a good book for those interested in learning a little about several different pirates. There is not a lot of detailed info but it is a good book to have to figure out which pirates you would like to read more about. It gives some of the major incidents in the lives of the pirates.If you are looking for detailing information on a specific pirate, this is not your book. But for those just starting to take an interest, I recommend it."
3,Somewhat confusing in parts...,"I was especially interested in the section about female pirate, Anne Bonny, and found some rather confusing information about her in this book. For one, I was not aware that Anne Bonny ever lived in Rhode Island, and I've never seen any primary source documents that substantiate this claim that Anne married the ""Lord"" of Fenwick Castle. There are no footnotes or references to turn to that would offer any explanations as to how Ms. Roberts obtained most of the information in this book. I gave the book ""three stars"" simply because of its entertainment value, but I have some doubts about the validity of some of the ""facts"" she presents."
2,Written for a Juvenile Audience,"I could not read beyond the first chapter on Blackbeard. I realized this novel was historical fiction, the author having used obviously fabricated dialouge to describe interactions. Nancy Roberts was a story teller, not a historian. And, the book was written for a juvenile audience. Not what I was looking to read."
4,nice job,"the only reason for the 4 is because i think it just made the limit in sending time. i have to compare the service of my regular clients. they are the ones that have ""raised the bar"""
1,Very Very Disappointed with this seller,"About seller: Live&Learn4Ever;I bought this book used, it suppose to be ""like new"" and when I got it, it was highlighted and it looked very very used!!!I have tried to locate this seller(Live&Learn4Ever;)they are not responding to my emails. I am very upset and disappointed. Please do not buy from this seller."
2,countries and concepts,"I knew this book was used, but, there were a lot of highlighting throuh out the book. The descripton on this book plainly stated that there were very few highlights in book. This was only true in the beginning of the book."
3,Somewhat dissastified,"The text turned out to be a teacher's edition. Not what was advertised. It also took a very long time to reach me. I am somewhat dissatisfied with the seller, but the product will have to do."
5,Hilarious tale of how a town reacts when a dinosaur visits.,"This highly entertaining tale describes how a town's inhabitants react when Rex the dinosaur arrives. Everyone has a unique way of reacting to the great big dinosaur with huge teeth. But the author's description of HOW the town reacts is what makes this story a true delight. Children will be delighted with the detailed and action-packed illustrations. Adults, however, may be surprised to find the pun-filled story line is as entertaining for them as for the intended 4 to 8-year-old reading audience. A true masterpiece of plays on language, parents will find themselves wanting to read this story again and again to their children -- and themselves!"
1,very disappointed,"while he is an excellent musician, the music is a let down - if you like joe satriani then check him out, but if you like tom morello/rage/audioslave type fat humbucker guitar sound and want to mix it with some heavy beats, check out the crystal method, overseer, and the dub pistols."
2,Not what I expected,"Having ordered this due to the auto-suggest I expected something similar to a Joe Satriani album...i.e. tight playing, haunting melodies etc.. However, what we have here instead is an indie bedroom album, while some of the songs have novelty interest, none of the songs are developed nearly enough and the overall production not of a quality expected for its price range....tinty drum machines, someguitar tones that sound like they are played beneath a blanket. Lastly, there is really no linking theme between the songs which leaves a listener without a proper code to appreciate what Nikhil is attempting. In summary, this album is fine if you realize you are getting an entry level work by a young aspiring artist, not a carefully crafted product of an artisan...."
3,A last attempt to dish out cards for PCI,"Nowhere else on the internet will you find a higher end graphics card for PCI buses, but that also has its consequences. My games (that require only a minumum of GeForce 3) can only run on low to medium quality graphics. There is also some lag. Even so, the games still crash from time to time (even when I'm only 5 minutes into the game so it's not overheating).My advice is: don't make the same mistake I made. Save up your money and spend it on a newer computer. PCI is already dead. I'm going to need a new computer soon."
5,Saved $75!!!,I cannot believe the bargain I got! I saved $75 by buying this book through Amazon that at the school bookstore.
5,Reactor,This yo-yo is a work of art in motion. It's smooth handling is great for string tricks and some looping tricks. The yo-yo takes a little while to break in but once that is done it's responce is spot on. Its has very solid constuction and dispite it being smaller then a standard yo-yo it makes up for that by being heavier. A great buy for the serious yo-yoer. I will be buying it's larger cusen the AXL elite.
5,The Greatest Hair Metal Band of all Time,"For 25 years they have been the biggest hair Metal band of all time, now here is a great complation of all their head banging tracks & power ballads from 1981- 2005 with tracks brand new on this CD, the CD features classics like ""Girls, Girls, Girls"", ""Dr. Feelgood"" ""Looks that Kill"" ""Home Sweet Home"" ""Too Young to Fall in Love"" & many more on 2 discs, listen to your Crue music b4 ya see em' with America's greatest Rock 'n' Roll band AEROSMITH!!!"
5,Nice Collection,"This is a great collection of their most popular songs. The other good thing about this cd is that they don't name it ""Greatest Hits"" again. Sometimes, if a band wants to release another ""Greatest Hit"" album, they name it the same. This album has a unique name. Thumbs up. This cd has all their great hits: ""Too Young To Fall In Love"", ""Kickstart My Heart"", ""Dr. Feelgood"" etc. The Crue did a good job on this cd. So if you're looking for a ""Greatest Hits"" collection, you should go for this album. The lyrics arn't very explict. You really can't tell. It's either this cd isn't that explict, or I'm dumb. Who knows. Get the album, and rock with the Crue."
3,"The what's good and what's bad about 'Red,White","Good:Live Wire/Piece Of Your Action/Toast Of The Town/Too Fast For Love/Looks That Kill/Too Young To Fall In Love/Helter Skelter/Shout At The Devil/Smokin' In The Boys Room/Use It Or Lose It/Girls,Girls,Girls/Wild Side/You're All I Need (better still if they mixed out the dated,cheezy keyboards...)/All In The Name Of.../Kickstart My Heart/Without You/Don't Go Away Mad(Just Go Away)/Same Ol' Situation(S.O.S.)/Dr. Feelgood/Anarchy In The U.K./Primal Scream/Home Sweet Home ('91 remix)/Planet Boom/Bittersuite/Afraid/Hell On High Heels/If I Died Tomorrow(the current hit from 'Red,White"
5,Motley Crue rocks,"This is the best Motley Crue album ever. It has all the good old songs on it and thats why I like it. I have a few old Motley cd's and mostley I buy them for 1 or 2 mabey even 3 good songs. This is why I like greatest hits, they have all of the best songs on them. They even have some new songs on there as well. Like If I Die Tomorrow, it is a really good song. Sick Love Song is a good one too,(it makes me think of an old girlfriend). Street Fighting Man is Ok. I don't really like it but its a good cover of a Stones song. If you buy any cds this year get this one. You wont be dissappointed."
3,the Crue will always rule !,"I love this band. But, I am disappointed that they have delayed their third and final boxset and instead re-re-released another greatest hits package. The new songs are decent enough but I really don't understand why it is that this band is no longer able to write their own music. There are only 2 new/original tracks on this disc which were both someone elses songs before the Crue Motleyized them. Don't get me wrong. The songs are good. But, how hard is it for professional musicians to get together and rock up two new tracks for the first time in six years ? Evidently, it is not possible in this situation. I know the Crue needed to release something to capitalize on their cuurently massive tour which has an amazing stage show. But, this package is really anti-climactic. Also, the foreword by David Wild is rather vanilla. The band should have gotten someone who actually liked the band to write it instead of a Rolling Stone magazine burnout."
4,Same Ol' Stuff (SOS),"You know what? This is nothing more but a rehash of the greatest hits cd along with the box set. It does include 3 new songs. I just listened to the whole cd while driving on the highway and it was just a blast! At times, I thought it was the 80's again. See you guys on tour! 4.5"
5,great hit's package,"Lot's og rockin out here, plus three new soungs and cool packaging. A good intro to the CRUE."
5,Motley Crue masters of heavey metal!!!!!!,"this CD is a perfect setup for thier tour which is one of the greatest tours in over a decade,it has all thier hits,which is a lot,it is a 2 CD package,if your a Motley Crue fan(a cruehead lol)you will love the CD,it has all thier hits on it and 3 new songs,why settle for less when you can have the best?this Cd igitied one of the greatest tours ever,Red,White,and Crue Better live then dead continued by changing the tour name to ""Carnival of sins tour"",the 3 new songs ""If I die tomarrow"",Sick Love song"", and another one,Sick Love song and If I would die tomarrow"" climbed up the billboard charts,Sick Love song video was made the same place and time as Motley Crues DVD Carnival of sins tourthis CD is a steal for the low price you pay for so many great tunesI recommend it to everyone that loves heavy metal and even to those who don'tMotley Crue has music for everyone"
3,its ok,most of the songs are from their greatest hits but i think that most of the cd stunk. i love motley crue but i was not happy about the cd
3,it's ok,"not a big crue fan here, but this is ok. juding from this compilation, i guess the best albums are the 80s ones. bittersuite is a nice giutar solo track from a '94 EP which was good. but i think all the songs from 1997 to now kinda blow. too pop for my taste. anyway my faves are smokin in the boys room, shout at the devil, live wire, black widow, wild side, dr feelgood. and some more early 80s tracks that i forgot the names of."
2,Isn't this...,... like their 8th or 9th greatest hits repackaging. Ugh. Buy a copy for your grandmother and rock on the porch. Tommy Lee's solo work is better then this stuff. I gave it 2 stars because my parents used to play some of these songs while I was vacuuming the house. Vince Neil. End of Review.
2,Gimmie a break.....................,"Come on and give me a fuggin break!!! This CD totally blows. I'm one of the few people on the planet that own a copy of the Leathur Records Version of ""Too Fast For Love"". Back then, Motely ruled the earth... PERIOD!!!Their day has come..................... and GONE!!!I still love them and will continue to buy everything they put out, BUT!!! Gimmie a break!!!"
1,I Hate This Band,"OK, now I know I am going to recieve half a dozen negative counter reviews from Crue fans, but I really don't care. If you think this band is heavy, you need therapy. Have you ever heard of bands like Suffocation? Or how about Cryptopsy? Perhaps Slayer, King Diamond, Celtic Frost, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death or Disgorge? Those bands are a TRUE metalhead's wet dream. This is pure fluff. And just try and compare Vince Neil's obnoxious whining to the vocals of Robert Plant or Chris Cornell. And what's with the make-up and Spandex pants? What kind of statement is that? I mean, they come off to me as the kind of band who fancy playing at gay bars. Big surprise.Avoid this band like the plague, along with all the other hair metal acts of the 80's.Burn in hell Motley Crue..."
5,The Best!,"This game is the best. First of all, it has good graphics,but if you are comparing them to GT or GT2 then thesegraphics are OK. I also like the view of inside the car.On some games you only get the back or the front. Anothergreat thing about this game is the weather you can changefrom foggy,rainy, sunny, or storm. I like the damage whenyou crash, but I don't think everybody likes it. The onlybad thing is that there are no codes for this game onxcheater.com so that you could get all of the cars andBonus Tracks, but that is the only thing that I don't likeabout this game. If you call the number for cheat codesinside of the game case they charge for the call. If youlike racing games I would get this game, but you would haveto buy it used because none of the stores sell them newmore. JUST GET IT!"
2,So-So,"Not the best design for a keychain. I pulled it out my pocket, there is no safety to keep the blade closed, it flicked open and sliced my hand. It was partly my fault, but still the design needs to be improved.And my light doesn't work, tried changing battery, no difference.. wiring is messed up or something.I still give it a 2/5 because the blade is pretty decent, and overall it is a nice item to keep handy if the light works :)"
5,The Beloved Invader,"The third of a series based on St Simon's Island, Georgia. Unfortunately I read it first, so had to then buy the books that came before."
3,Could be great.,"The storyline was great. Looking for the last chapter of a love story that was written years earlier had fantastic potential. I always enjoys a good romantic movie and this designed to be one.However the entire movie focused on finding and finishing the last chapter and the love between the author for his wife and the desire of the editor to see the book published. The level of expectation was built so high that no ending could possibly live up to the internal fantasy that we all hoped for.The acting was somewhat bland and understated and through out the film there was a sense of missing something. Having said all this, I loved the movie and continue to watch it however, I also enjoyed sheena.I would reccommend this to anyone to is a romantic, enjoy"
3,The kiss...good movie,"Though i rather enjoyed the story as well as the movie i must admit the players where a little off. Francoise Surel plays the main character. She seemed way off to me, she didnt fit the role. Billy Zane was lovely as always as the romantic lead, there should have been more of him. Which is a little deceiving since he's on the cover and the total you might see him in is 20 mins total. so if you're going to buy this movie strickly because of Billy, rent it first before buying it. Eliza Dushku as the roommate had her moments. Great actress, very different from what she's known for. Terence Stamp is such an amazing actor, in this movie he just pulls you in. You actually feel for this man.so all in all its a good movie. Before you buy it though you should really rent it or buy it on amazon when its like super cheap so you dont want to shoot yourself if the foot for buying it after you watch it."
5,Basic Book,"This is a very interesting book about strenght training, with a fine balance between pratical advices and scientific principles. Only one phrase can define this book: It's a Must!!!!"
5,The best theory based strength and conditioning book availab,An excellent book that describes useful strength and conditioning practices.
4,"Like the office, only better.","I don't know why I like reading books about work life so much, but this onewas very articulate in its analysis of the air i breathe everyday, 9 to 5.I wish i was swimming in a different pond, but for now its nice to have the parks and rec guide to the one I am in. Good book to keep around the office."
5,And you thought happiness couldn't be bought!,"Read this book! But don't read it like one of those predictable, ho-hum, chapter-by-chapter, plot-thickening numbers. Read it savoring the taste of each little section of comedic brilliance. Read it out loud sitting around the kitchen table. Read it knowing you're going to have to read this baby again and again until D.W. Martin publishes his next masterpiece.This book is so funny, it will improve your sense of humor by up to fifty points!! Do you know what St. Augustine heard that brought about his great conversion? He heard the voice of a little child saying ""take up and read.""So do what a great saint did and take up and read Officespeak!(Note: Augustine didn't have Officespeak yet, but I'm guessing Officespeak will probably become as famous as the 'good book' that he ended up using.)BUY IT! READ IT! LOVE IT!"
2,Guess you had to be there,"I know, I know...this book is supposed to be funny, but after the umpteenth T&A joke it got pretty ""booorrriiinnggg."""
5,So cute.,I purchased this as a Xmas gift. It arrived before I expected it and was securely shipped. My mother-in-law loves it.
4,okay,it is just like any another beanie babie. I like it it was shipped fast. try aefb aefdg adfb ebb
5,Got it for looks,"Bought this to keep on my daughter's bed, since the theme in her room is ""Zebra"". Looks good and it made well. It could be a fine toy, but she is too old to play with toys. It is a cute addition to the decor."
1,Star Doesn't Shine in This One,"I was expecting a biography-type reading. Instead she went on and on about diet, exercise, make-up, etc.--things I already knew. If I had wanted a book about personal improvement I could have bought any other of many good books written by professionals. I was totally disappointed. I read less than half of the book and couldn't even bring myself to finish it."
1,5-star reviews for this book? Hmmmm...,"My friend and I picked this book up at a yard sale for $.25 based on our mutual loathing of SJR. It was everything we dreamed it would be: Self-absorbed, deluded, nearly illiterate and Harlequinesque. She could teach Paris Hilton a thing or two about self-promotion; it's so disgustingly shallow and materialistic that it moves into the realm of parody after only a couple of paragraphs. However, I cannot deny that I laughed a lot. From a questionable marriage to a strangely accelerated weight loss and tacky, drag-diva makeover; this book is a riot. Yet, oddly, some ""reviewers"" found this inspirational? Funny how their comments are so very brief and this is the only book that has inspired them to write a review. I'm just saying..."
1,One Star for Star!,"Goodness...what does one do when their first review is taken off by Amazon? In my case, write another because I do feel that I can add my 2 cents on this book without fear!! Star Jones has written a ""tell all"" book that basically tells nothing. For someone that was so strong in her ""plus size"" power she fails to tell us the one thing we all want to know: Dang, girlfriend, how DID you get so skinny? Jones glosses over this tidbit, prefering to tell us instead that she ""eats half of what is on her plate""--well, I would too if my my stomach were 1/4 of it's size! If you didn't have an operation, fine, but let us know how you control your once out of control cravings!As for ""love""--I sure didn't learn much from this book. Save your money and call it a day."
1,A Waste Of MONEY,"This book was a waste of time and money. Who lets this stuff get printed? Star is full of herself and is a fool to think anyone cares about what brand of face wash she uses. The whole, ""Think like a lawyer"" bit was rather patronizing. Other people, outside the legal profession, use critical thinking when making decisions and are ""methodical"" as she likes to say. ""Auntie Star"" is ridiculously materialistic, and I found the majority of this book to be shallow and even insulting. If you are a seriously Star Jones fan, get the book, otherwise enlighten yourself with something else."
2,How Star Found a rich man!,If you would like to hear a fairy tale this is the book for you! I was expecting a biography on her life and how she found love. Not 101 ways to catch a rich man. Very unhappy with the book.
3,Not Good,I did not read the entire book and I don't think I will. I was very bored after about 2 chapters. These 2 chapters did not propel me into reading more. It is more of a how-to book and not something to read for entertainment or ejoyment.
5,This book is a Shiny Star in my opinion!,"I have often bought celebs books they have written or co-written and were disappointed in the substance of the book. BUT this time I was happy to read a book that was real and not some glorified book out to make them some money.In Shine, Star was so open and has made herself so vunerable by revealing her inner feelings of herself and life and all she went through. In my opinion this makes her a real person, someone just like me and you. I applaud her for going ahead and putting it all out there in print to encourage the rest of us that making a change in our lives successfully is possible for ALL us not just a chosen few.I recommend this book for anyone who wants to make a change for the best in their lives. Buy it!! You wont be disappointed and in fact you will be encourage to keep striving for a better you too!You go, Star!![...]"
1,I Don't Buy It,"God bless Star Jones, but I just can't buy her ruminations after watching her for years on The View. I don't think she is being honest, just presenting her idea of a new persona that still lacks humility and compassion."
1,Disappointed,"After all the media attention surrounding this book, I had to read it to see what all the commotion was about. I'm very disappointed. None of the tips and pointers provided were unique. It is all imformation that I have read elsewhere. For example, there's absolutely nothing new with writing a wish list for the person you want to attract. My friends and I did that very same thing when I was 15.My feeling is that Ms. Jones-Reynolds journey is not yet complete since she hasn't yet achieved contentment in her life. She isn't content with the celebrity status she has already received - now she wants others to view her as an expert of love...a love coach. I'm not sure how she feels she is qualified for this title. Her self proclaimed title of ""diva"" is far more believable.If you are curious about this book (as I was) please avoid the urge to make a purchase. Instead, chose one of the many well respected authors who also has the education and experience needed to provide sound advice."
1,"I fell for it hook, line and sinker","All the hype of how she was going to reveal how she lost her weight was just that, hype to get you to buy the book. I am happy for her that she is healthy and happy, but I didn't need to spend my hard earned money to read what I can hear every day on The View."
1,Star Is A Big Joke!,"Star Jones makes a mockery of the Christian faith in this book especially in the chapter on morals and sex! She blatantly mocks the Biblical teaching that sex is wrong outside of marriage regardless on ones age or any other circumstance. The little ""pyramid"" that she created is a big joke. She redefines the Bible and her spirituality to fit her own desires and needs. Don't waste your time!"
1,Vanity personified,Yet another semi-celebrity proclaiming their proficiency in subjects best left to the professionals. One would hope that this trend will end and someone will realize that this fluff belongs in weekly magazines and not on the library shelf.
5,I prefer a flan...,"Unfortunately, I received this book from my grandmum for my birthday. I think she overheard me saying, ""I'm jonesin' for a car."" and somehow misheard it as ""I want Star Jones' new book."" Anyway, quick review. If you have even the slightest bit of common sense, you'll not need this book. While, I celebrate Star's meteoric rise to the highest level of daytime talk shows, this tome is little more than skullduggery disguised as gladhanding. I wonder how self-aware Star is. Does she actually think that people need this advice? Or is she simply trying to cash in on her exposure? I don't begrudge her trying to make a buck, but I just hope people know what they're getting. [...]"
3,Good Point but Wordy at Times,I give it an okay rating. Some topics were a bit wordy and could have been left out. For the most part I enjoyed the book and it's an easy read.
1,Shame on you Star!!,"As an avid reader I was simply shocked by the absurb and selfish writing's by Ms.Star Jones-Reynolds. Her book is filled with pompous arrogance and childish advice that literally made me sick.In my opinion, this book is not worth $[...]. Heck it is not even worth a penny.""Shine"" is simply a waste of money and time. Instead of buying Jones-Reynolds book I would suggest you pick up the latest copy of MAD Magazine instead. Far more intelligent and thoughtful than than this book."
1,A waste of time,"I wanted to like this book. But it was so poorly written that I'm convinced if it were some non-famous person's book, it wouldn't have even been considered for publication. Do not waste your time or money on this."
5,Dog Gone - coping with the loss of your pet,"I had recently lost my 12 yr. old Old English Sheepdog. He meant a great deal to me. In an attempt to cope with my feelings of loss, I found this book and ordered it. Little did I know the author would be writing about the loss of his OES, Grady. The author explains what it was like for him to lose Grady in a way that will touch your own feelings of loss. You will smile, remember little things, and shed some tears along the way. The book is a quick read, and is very easy for the average person to understand. The book has helped me to understand that I am not the only person to struggle with the loss of their companion. I highly recommend it for any dog lover, but especially OES lovers."
4,You won't be disappointed,"In a word, Evocative; a very compelling read, hardly a hint of the self-consciousness you might expect in his prose, seemingly honest but also guarded. You won't get any of your questions answered - this is as far from a tell-all book as you can get. Read it for the lovely language and some fleeting glimpses into the man - almost makes up for all those disappointing concerts."
5,Fills In Many Blanks,"I've always wondered about what went on behind the scenes in Bob Dylan's life. This great book which chronicles BD's early, middle, and later periods is a thought-provoking look behind the curtain of the inscrutable OZ. Really well written. Kept my interest throughout."
5,One of the best audio books ever.,"This is one of the best audio books ever. Sean Penn reads portions of Dylan's autobiography, and its essentially Sean Penn playing Bob Dylan. How much of this is fact, and how much is fiction? Who knows? Either way, it's absolutely fascinating. If you can find it, get it."
5,Warning,Don't start reading this book if you have something important to do because once you start it'll be very hard to put it down. So much better than even the reviews led me to expect.
3,"Bob Dylan, eh...","I thought that this book was ok, since I don't like to read. I love music (metal) but wanted to get to know who Bob Dylan is. This book told me the main details of Bob's career. I recommened this to people who love to read. For others, they might find this boring."
2,Mehhhh,"The book was fantastic in the beginning and in the end - but somewhere in the middle Dylan seemed to get caught up in his own self pity and bitterness of his fame. He talks about his fans with little affection, and resents his name as the leader of a generation. Yet, he contradicts himself later while he attempts to rediscover an audience, a new, younger group. At times I felt like I was wasting my time reading him whine. However, this could be a tribute to his ability to let us understand. At the beginning he is in Greenwich very open minded, and in the end he gets a contract with columbia records - in the middle he is burnt out and tired of his life."
1,"maybe a deep poet, certainly a shallow writer","Your hometown whitepages telephone directory has fewer names in it, is more interesting, cheaper, less boring, is written in better english and is not self-celebrating. Read that."
2,Attn: Ghost Writer required,"Upon completion of this book, I came away knowing less about Bob Dylan than before I picked it up. There must be a reason he elaborates on certain aspects of his life that would appear to be trivial in nature to most people however we've no idea why these events warrant pages of type.I don't buy this 'He's a genius so everything he does is genius'. Even a genius can fire blanks now and again. Dylan is no exception. Why is this books timeline so jumbled? What's the point of it? Presumably he chose the order in which his rather boring anecdotes were presented in, however again we're left scratching our heads.Too many names dropped, not enough editing. This guy's a songwriter - not a writer."
2,There are better things to buy with your money,This man's life is BORING. Don't buy this book. Not even the graphic description of his sex life saved this book. There were a few moments. The bit where he talks about chasing some guy's dog with a knife was funny but unnecessary.
1,Don't waste your money on the audio.,"Imagine ""The Kid Stays In The Picture"" narrated by anyone other than Robert Evans? No way. What a disappointment to find Dylan's ""Chronicles"" read by someone other than Dylan - it's laughable! Hahaha! Why bother? Don't. Read the book instead . . ."
5,This man absolutely loved music.,"I loved this book. It is written entirely from the point of view of his love for music and the influences people have had on his life related to music. It is not a tell all book so those looking for that kind of expose won't find it in this book. What they will find is how much he lived, breathed, and thought music and how he loved observation. If there is one phrase that describes this book, it is Dylan the Observer."
3,Still Tight-Lipped About His Life and Work,"Chronicles Vol. I reveals very little about Bob Dylan's inner-workings. After years of being tight-lipped about his music and life, the book offers little that is fresh or new, with one exception. Dylan creates a vivid early portrait of New York City's early folk music scene, that allows the reader one glimpse into Dylan's mindset in that time as he interacts with the key musicians of that time. However, the rest of the book doesn't follow that path. In fact, Dylan skips time periods and omits huge periods of his life. He never even mentions his wife's name. He reveals hardly anything about the creation of what are considered his masterworks. In all, the book left me unsatisfied."
3,Dylan's life,"I didn't really grow up during the ""Bob Dylan era"", but I was introduced to his music recently, and I really love it. Of course, I wanted to know more about the artist, and this book was good insight into the major influences in his life and music. It's not written chronologically, but rambles around a bit from the time he left Minnesota and headed to New York. Very interesting book. If you want to know more about Bob Dylan, buy this book. More Chronicles are on the way."
1,Couldn't Cut Butter on a Hot Day,"Dull, dull, dull. A rambling stream of consciousness that is totally self-centered. Oh, the burdens of fame! It is so demanding! And then my 40 foot sailboat was wrecked! Life is so unfair! Puhleez. He resents being the ""voice of his generation"" all the while he writes a book about it. I don't hate this book, but I don't like it. A good music book about people who also were ""the voice of their generation"" is Geoff Emerick's ""Here, There & Everywhere"" about the Beatles. It is a fun and fast read and you actually learn something about how it all happened and all fell apart."
1,What a horrific waste of paper.....,"I am a member of a book club and someone chose this book as our inagural offering. I was unfamiliar with Bob Dylan and saw this as perhaps an opportunity to learn more about his life. After reading this book, I've come to the distinct conclusion that not only do I not know more about his life, I'm not entirely certain Mr. Dylan does either. There is no plot, no sequence of thought - just mind-numbing rambling which leads to nothing. It's almost as if his mind vomitted words and they somehow congealed into a published book. My sincerest wish is that ""Volume Two"" would not be foisted upon an unsuspecting world. If only it were possible to give it less than 1 star......"
2,Is Dylan still alive?,"I remember loving the music twenty years ago, but I was disappointed by the book. It didn't take me back to a good place or give me extraordinary insight into this man. I felt is was just another way for him to make a buck and keep his name alive."
2,"Two stars for this one star, some times","I alternated between amused interest and stark raving boredom. While Dylan would paint an intriguing word picture of some of the times and places that he has passed through, some times his words would read like a pile of blank verse that wasn't really all that moving or even interesting. One example of the things that reached me was his encounter with Gorgeous George near the beginning of his career. An example of what left me cold were his overwrought declarations of self-perceived importance to his generation and the revolutions of the sixties. It left me wanting to say to him, ""Lighten up, Bob."""
4,Well-written memoir,"In Chronicles Vol. 1, Dylan eschews formal autobiography in favour of recalling three periods of his life: his early singing days in New York and Minnesota, the making of his early 70s' ablum New Morning, and the creation of his heralded late-80's ""comeback"" album No Mercy with producer Daniel Lanois. Dylan writes in a poetic and personal style, reflecting on past loves and the frustrations bestowed by fame. The chapters are laced with tributes to his musical influences, especially artists like Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson. Dylan approaches the book with no axes to grind and few unkind words for his peers.I've long admired Dylan's art, and this memoir confirms my suspicion that he's primarily a poet who employs music as a building block for his poems. Given that, it's hard to understand why fans and critics have sought to annoint him as a partisan political leader or a god."
4,The Onion?,"As good as I thought it would be, and different from what I expected at the same time. Made me want to buy Oh Mercy, after feeling like I sat in on those sessions.I hope very much that there is a Volume 2.Anybody else think it's weird that The Onion was listed as one of the publications praising this book (back of the paperback edition.)"
