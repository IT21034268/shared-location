5,"Fun ""car"" bed","This wooden ""car"" bed has been a hit with our toddler son. He hasn't had any trouble adjusting to it from a crib, and he hasn't had problems with rolling out of bed. A previous review that I read mentioned that the sides of the bed were hard and/or hurt, but this hasn't been a problem for our son up to this point. We have had the bed for about a month and have had no trouble with it."
1,Poor quality,"Very cool looking bed, son saw it and was ecstatic. Instructions included were nearly worthless, multiple screws literally broke when screwing the bed; once FINALLY together, attempted to move it and the screwed in back fell off. The wood quality is similar to cardboard, not even as good of quality as cheap plywood. I will be returning this bed as soon as I can get it taken apart and back in the box."
4,Boy loves his bed.,My son really enjoys having this bed instead of his convertible crib. It is a very simple product...just 4 pieces of wood connected at their corners. The only gripe I have is that the top edges are very sharp. I wish they're were rounded. Any contact while getting in & out of this bed without being careful may produce skin abrasions.
3,Decent book,"This was an okay book, nothing special, you run-of-the-mill period romance. Worth a read of course if you are a fan of Suzanne Enoch"
4,"Witty, clever and a great romantic Regency!","Enochs books are not quite the depth of character as a Stephanie Lauren or Gaelen Foley - more light hearted and fun. Still this was a good read and kept my interest throughout with lots of great dialog and enough romance to keep a romantic like myself interested. Rafe was the perfect hero, a rake with a heart. And maybe not so much a rake as a man who truly needed a home and a purpose in life. Felicity gave him both - a reason to reform and a wonderful woman to love. You will not be disappointed in this book."
4,Taming Rafe,He is a sexy sexy hero. She is the damsel in distress. Of course he intends to sell her ancestral home after winning it in a card game. But in the end loves rules and his wanderlust turns around. It is a witty Regency novel. You'll love it.
4,The Tea Kettle Incident.....Bring True Love,"I really loved the characters in this book. Rafe is the ultimate rake in this story. He is a wandering second son who doesn't do anything to make anyone happy, but himself of course. So Rafe is sitting in a gaming hall and wins Forton Hall. His big plan is to go sell the estate as soon as he can can get out of England, maybe China? When he gets to Forton Hall he find the estate sadly lacking (totally run to the ground) and what he believes to be thieves. Enter Lis (Felicity) and May who clobbers him over the head with a tea kettle. From there the fireworks start of fly between Lis and Rafe. All you need now is the villian, enter James stage right. This was my only problem with the book ..... we know why James wants Forton Hall, which unfortunately makes the story kind of boring (hence the four stars instead of five).....but all in all this book was great and the passion between Rafe and Lis is incredible."
3,"good, but boring at times","When my language arts teacher recommended Suzannne Enoch to me as a romance author, I immediately ran to the bookstore to buy her books. I read By Love Undone first and I loved it, so I eagerly picked up Taming Rafe right afterwards. I loved the character of Rafe, who is still the embodiment of the perfect rake for me. He's so charming, noble, caring, funny, and charismatic that I just fell in love with him. However, in my opinion, the plot was boring and I got tired of the storyline pretty quickly. Even Rafe couldn't speed it along. The characters are quite lovable, including little May and Beeks, the butler. But the heroine, Felicity, didn't appeal to me all that much, perhaps because the story centered around Rafe so much. All in all, the book had great characters, but the plot just plain bored me."
2,Satire? That Quickly Grows Tiresome,"Sort of an odd stew satirizing porn novels and English political extremists featuring an antihero skinhead as the catalyst for many things. Loads of over-the-top sex, violence and ideological debate make for a somewhat tiresome book. Not likely to appeal to many people."
5,"A great cd of Doris' early stuff, at a budget price...","Doris Day is well featured here in this exellent 3 cd set! What a great budget price. The msuic is exeelnt and the sound quality fine. every Doris Day fan needs to own thsi, you won't find many of these songs elsewhere without having to pay over one hundred dollars for one of the bear box sets. A great Doris Days cd set!!! Full of lot's of rarities and surprises!!!"
5,The true essence of a modern day story teller.,"So you want to start somewhere? Make this your first stop. Paul Kelly is the one artist all Australians will come back to. No matter where you are, or how you feel, the music is timeless. Forget the charts-with more accomplishments than any other he is up there, standing next to 'TheDon'."
5,something special,"For all y'all Americans, PAul Kelly is probably an unknown. That's a pity - he's something very rare and special.It's hard to put a finger on what makes Kelly so good. His voice is distinctive sure, but its not very pretty - or strong for that matter. He play's guitar, even harmonica, but again don't expect anyhtng much other than a few open chords in his songs.It's as a songwriter that Kelly makes his mark. His songs are catchy, often instantly appealing and resonant. They sound familiar. Many remind me of my childhood through the 80's - like old friends.Tracks like ""From St Kilda to Kings Cross', 'Before too long', 'Dumb things', 'Too her door' and 'Lover never runs on time' are very special to me for this reason.Kelly dabbles in Rock, Pop, and Folk in this collection. He is convincing and honest. I saw that Kevin Bloody Wilson is outselling him at Amazon.com - that's a crime; this CD deserves so much more."
4,A two-day romp,"I read Mad Pursuit in two sitting, thoroughly enjoying Maggie Featherstone who did not let herself sink into the position of agrieved wife. Her own strong characteristics saved her from being the victim and made the story into a easy-to-digest life lesson. We should all have such a magical cast of characters in our lives to help us see our own strengths."
2,Nice instight hidden in the pages,"The book is not bad. The most valuable sections of this book include topics of Structure-Process-Outcome (sometimes), cognitive learning, values, culture, goals, working with tools, and communication. The diagrams and tables in this book are almost not helpful at all; sometimes you wonder if diagrams like figure 1-3 on page 23 is downright necessary to have there. I felt like parts four and five of the book really dragged on unnecessarily, especially the chapter on organizational engineering. It seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page 300. I think that Hoemann had a lot of potential in this book when I first saw it, and I was let down. Another nice thing would be for him to drop the plethora of coined-terms. Overall, there is some really nice thoughts in here, but there is a lot of unnecessary things that you have to thumb through."
5,Thought provoking with good ideas,"I have really enjoyed reading this book. It is packed full of information. For example there are sections on personality types and problem solving approaches, as well as sections on creating teams from disparate personalities and the challenges of building teams.I found this book thought provoking and a good introduction to a wealth of information on sociology issues in software development. People issues are important in team development of software, and most of us will have to work in teams for a large part of our careers. The bibiography is large, good for following up on topics of particular interest.I don't expect to use everything in the book, but will pick and choose what is appropriate in each particular situation."
1,Chinese-made piece of junk,"When I bought this foot pump I wasn't expecting much of it, given the ridiculously low price I paid (less than 10$). However, it turned out to be even below my expectations: there is no way it can reach its maximum rating of 100 PSI since it can barely handle a bicycle tyre. This really confirms that what you pay is what you get! I guess this is the kind of product that really needs to be seen -and felt- in order to assess the quality of its construction."
4,it works,"this foot pump works fine for low pressure fills. It is a short fill cylinder so it takes a lot of pumps to fill your item, but it is effective. You need to make sure its on a level surface since the 4 feet need to be stable. it is a little wobbly, but if you use it with care it will do the job just fine."
1,Pressure Gauge DOA,"As with one of the other reviews, this pump really is junk. The pump worked but the pressure gauge gave a limp attempt at working on the first pump, then gave up the ghost completely. I am sure 99% of these types of foot pumps are made in the same factory in China and the companies here just put their names on it. They should be a little more particular 'cause this is the last cycle force product I will buy. Of course, it is hit or miss, so you just might be lucky and get one of rare ones that works. But for $11, what can you expect??"
3,Could be better.,"The antenna seems to work well enough but it suffers from some design flaws. The first is that the whole thing is too light weight. There is no weight in the base so the center of gravity is higher which results in the antenna being easy to tip over. This is aggravated by having the coax cable going straight down and then doin a sharp right angle out the 'back' of the antenna. You can't see it in the picture but there is nothing holding the coax. So the coax tends to not stay in place causing the antenna to easily tip.Another not so obvious design is that the 'grill' you see in the picture is actually a flat, clear, flexible piece of plastic with a grill printed on it with some 'metalic' like ink."
4,same as WINEGARD SS-3000,"On Amazon user recommendation I bought two WINEGARD SS-3000 from another retailer. They arrived in three days. Very pleased. The unit is larger than I expected, so check the dimensions, but has a streamlined style. The instructions are a bit brief and I had to do some guessing and studying the photo, but it turned out to be easy, provided I was patient. Assembly took only about 20 minutes. My house has aluminum siding and I live in a heavily wooded area, but I get great reception on all possible stations for my area. I have the unit sitting on a windowsill facing out, as this seems to be the best place, but I get as good reception with the unit on top of the TV with the unit facing the window. I unplugged the amplifier as it didn't seem to do anything, but will try using it again occasionally to see if I more stations have become available. The unit is more expensive than some, but I feel the price is worth it."
5,Terk HDTVLP Antenna,"It did a great job of receiving HD channels, we are 25 miles away from the towers."
4,Terk HDTVLP,"Having used a Terk TV antenna in a motor home, for about 12 years, I was very familiar with the product. When I needed an antenna, to replace the ""rabbit ears"" for the TV, in the kitchen, I saw the possibility of upgrading to a product that would be receptive to the ""all digital"" broadcasts, when they are introduced. Despite the ""ground floor"" location, I have not been disappointed in this product and look forward to many years of its use."
1,Not an OUTDOOR antenna,"Beware, although this is advertised an an indoor/outdoor antenna, it is not. It is INDOOR ONLY. So I ended up returning the item and by the time I paid the shipping BOTH directions, I was within $15 of what the antenna cost!!!DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA"
2,do not buy if over 29.99,This Antenna works better as a non powered antenna then a powered. I had to return mine after a few times moving it around the crimp on the wire gave out and it feel apart. there are better cheaper Antenna you are not getting what you are paying for.
5,Night and Day!,"I initially purchased the Terk HDTVa antenna, and couldn't pick up a darn thing (see my review under that product). However, with this HDTVLP antenna, it's night and day. I now receive 20 stations from both Baltimore and DC broadcasts (over 50 miles away!) It did take me a number of trials to position the antenna so that I could receive all 20 stations at the same time, but I think I'm finally successful. For me, the Terk HDTVLP worked much better than the Terk HDTVa, like night and day!"
4,It works,"I had a Terk indoor/outdoor antenna installed previously. It pulled in most of the available HD channels, but not all of them. I put it in my attic and got the same performance. I set this one up in my living room and it pulls in all of them. And the closer it is to a window the better it works. It's an eye soar sitting here though. I want to see how it works in the attic, but haven't gotten around to getting up there in the summer heat. Since it pulls in signals through windows I don't know if it will work well behind a roof. It's too unsightly in the living room, so if it doesn't work in a hidden spot, I won't continue to use it."
1,Too much money for too few channels,"This antenna may work for some people, but for me it was another regrettable purchase. The assembly is fairly easy, but the results proved a letdown. I bought the Terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the Samsung DTB-H260F set top box I am using to bring in free OTA digital and HD stations. But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best. Analog reception proved even worse. When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed, less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions, the difference in performance was amazing...I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels. In conclusion, my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification. It's that extra power that made the difference for me. Sorry Terk..."
1,This is a WineGard SS-3000 Antenna,"The antenna pictured is made by Winegard (model number SS-3000) that is normally sold everywhere on the internet for substantially less. So you are paying a lot more for the same antenna with a TERK name on it, it appears."
1,only hypes,"I bought this antenna based on good reviews here, but I really found out it works even worse than inserting a piece of wire to the coaxial jack of my TV. Returned promptly, but had to pay round trip shipping fees. Think twice before buying it."
2,overrated,i understand that many people are of the opinion that this album was ground breaking. are you kidding me? this album is blasé and uninspired. listen to chris clarks's clarence park for a comparable album that is thousands of times better and 5 years older.
3,Fantastic Radio - Horrible Batteries,"The radio worked great for my kids. The range was limited, but better than I expected. It fit good, did not come off, strong case, and even sounded good on both ends. They worked great about 10 times, but then the batteries would not even charge. I have lots of NiCad's and even a timed charging station so they did not get over charged. These special (not to be found anywhere else) batteries are just junk. They are easy to swap, but I am not sure I want to put up with customer service or the price trying to get more."
2,No Sound,They worked well for a few months and now the sound does not come out of either one. Customer service has not been called yet to figure out the problem.
3,Nice product,"This is a nice backpack with good features. There are all kinds of compartments inside, and a very handy small compartment up top near the handle where you can put keys or whatever that you need quick access to. It has nice styling, including reflective threads in the cinch cords across the back, which add a little safety for night walkers.My only gripe is that the shoulder pads are not all that padded. And there is no across-the-chest snap, like you have with some other backpacks, which would help keep the shoulder pads where you placed them -- so they tend to drift outward slightly as I walk, though never coming off the shoulder. However, I often tend to carry my backpack, rather than wearing it, so this is less of an issue for me."
3,Learning VB .Net,"I have found this book to be a pretty good introdution to VB .Net. It has a well written section on OOP. However, I have found numerous discrepancies in the book when doing the examples. It also makes references to things that probably happened in the Beta version (which was what was available at the time of publication) and don't happen now. A beginning programer will be confused by this and MS support site does not offer much assistance. Because of these issues I would not recommend this to a brand new programmer."
4,A good intermediate book,"The book is well written and the author has done a great job to keep everything simple to understand even though he's talking about OOP! You'll get a good overview of things you can do with VB.NET, illustrated with good examples.Unfortunately, there is also many little technical mistakes in this book. Most of them might have been caused by the changes between the beta and release version of VB.NET but I have been disapointed to find so many of them! I thought that a book with the name Microsoft on it would be more accurate... It's not the case!"
3,Mediocre intro,"Connell's work here does an okay job at introducing VB.Net to developers. One problem I had is that it is unclear who the intended audience is. In some parts the explanations he gives are very basic and helpful with a significant of ""hand-holding"", in other ares they are cryptic. Additionally, the chapter on ASP.NET and Web Services was far too brief relative to their usefulness - hence I only give it 3 stars."
3,Padded his Resume?,"The book is a pretty good transition from VB6 to VB.NET, but the author either lied about having used VB6, or wasn't as knowledgeable about it as he thinks he is. I am constantly shaking my head as he makes statements about VB6 that are just not true.More distrubing, though, are the cases where his VB6 knowledge is not tempered with any experience. For example, he states that a variable declared AS NEW isn't actually instantiated until it is used. This is true. But any VB programmer worth his pay knows that you don't use AS NEW, but instead instantiate the object later in your code when you actually need the variable.While it does a decent job providing an overview of VB.NET, I am left wondering if the techniques I am learning are really the best, or even acceptable, given the fact that this supposed ""expert"" on VB6 does not display expert knowledge of it."
1,For vb programmer beginner with lot of money to spend,"Le titre de ce livre ne convient tout simplement pas. En achetant ce livre, je m'attendais à ce que le contenu soit avancé. Habituellement, lorsque l'on est rendu au point d'apprendre des techniques de codage, on a pas besoin de savoir ce qu'un integer ou d'avoir un exemple de programmation orientée objet avec une classe de 1 méthode et 2 propriétés. Enfin bref, un autre livre sur lequel on peut dire qu'on apprends rien d'autre que des petits trucs simple et faciles à trouver sur Internet gratuitement. En plus, le livre cote bien trops cher. Je ne pouvais pas mettre 0/5 alors je me suis contenté de mettre 1 étoile."
1,Tacky and written for uneducated fools.,"I just finished reading this book and i was appauled. The book covers nothing but stripper stories which do nothing more than make the stripper out to be a major whore! I have no opinion on women selling their bodies, stripping, or making movies, but this book would definately make me respect them less than I already do."
5,Trini tricks,Ever try to make those recipes from home and had to start over. This is a wonderful guide to help you make those meals from St. James and others. Cannot go wrong.
3,Sweet Hands review,"I enjoyed the book very much. It had very traditional recipes that I have been looking for, for years like pammie and dhal. I have tried a few recipes in the book and they came out great. I was not big on such a long intro in the front of the book but it's a good introduction for someone who is not too familiar with Trinidadian cooking"
3,Historical inaccuracies make it hard to trust recipes,"I appreciate that someone even made the effort to showcase our rich and diverse culture through the vehicle of a cookbook so kudos to the author. However, being placed on the grand stage that amazon allows, requires greater care in the information that is actually put out to the world.Trinidad was discovered on Columbus' 3rd voyage to the New World and NOT his 2nd. Also, the Dutch nor French ever held control over Trinidad. It was the Spanish (who allowed French planters to own plantations via the Cedula of population) who first controlled Trinidad and then the British who wrested control in 1797. Those missteps about the history of the country whose name this book is in is a huge turnoff.Apart from that, ok recipes."
2,No match to Naparima Girls Cook book,"It's okay. I tried her recepies on basics like breads and it was bland. I think she's mixing Trini with some other culture's recepie and it's just not working too well. The way she describes ponche crema is not the simple, delicious way a Trini makes it-- We don't add cream of coconut!I should have put the money towards the Naparima Girls book. Never heard one complaint about that book from any die-hard Trini."
2,This is NOT the sinus pillow...,"Make sure you read the description carefully before ordering so you're getting what you really want. This particular pillow cannot be used with heat, unlike the sinus pillow which works both hot or cold."
3,Doesn't fit all miter slots,"I wasn't able to use these parts because they don't fit ""in any t-slot grove"". Apparently, many less expensive tools use non-standard slots. Measure your miter slot before purchasing."
5,A fine caving book.,"Almost fifty years ago, two rock climbers entered a 'nice little cave' to survey it. They had never gone caving before, and wanted to try it out. Because of their efforts, that cave, Jewel Cave, is today the second longest cave in the US. This book tells the tale in a fluent, easy style that is sure to delight and enjoy. Next to 'The Longest Cave' it is possibly the most enjoyable exploration story about caving around. you will be amazed at the amount of work a small group of people was able to do, from the sometimes tortuous mapping of the cave, to the hard backbreaking labor involved in making a portion of their discovery open for public viewing, as part of Jewel Cave Natl. Monument. A large map comes with the book so you can follow them as they explore the ever expanding labyrynth. The 'Jewel Cave Adventure' is a great book for everyone, whether you are seriously interested in the undergorund or just looking for a darn good read."
5,caving in South Dakota,What an adventure Jan and Herb Conn experienced! I have had the great experience of actually meeting the Conns in person and they are as delightful to visit with as they are in the book. Anyone who is into speleology should buy this book and relish the fun and science occuring through-out it.
1,WAY TOO SMALL,"dont be fooled, it is barely an inch big, the picture will decieve you!!! A complete waste of 12 buckks!"
5,Much more than a survival story,"It's quite sad that someone with limited spelling and vocabulary felt the need to write three separate reviews against this book, merely changing the order of the complaint. Clearly, s/he didn't understand it. This book does not merely discuss the fact that Francie had a rough life that she managed to overcome; remember, as she and Neeley discussed the future after their mother remarried, they reminded each other how much fun it had all been along the way. Francie's struggles, analogous to the tree of the title, are what stimulated her young mind. Smith's writing so crisply describes tenement life, but she also gives Francie the credit for making crucial decisions along the way (changing schools, for example), rather than depending on others to think for her. My mother tried to get me to read this book for years, but it is not a book for young children--it took adulthood for me to truly appreciate this wonderful, heartfelt book."
4,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"I have to admit that it took a long time for me to get into the story. If I hadn't enjoyed the film and didn't know the story as well as I did from my grandmother, I probably would have stopped around page 100 or so. The first third of the story is centered around the struggles and the shame of being poor. The second third allows the characters some time to blossom and shows the sacrifices families are willing to make to give the children a better chance. The final third shows the first tenous results of those years of sacrifice and at last the characters come into their own. Of course there are also the themes of life lessons learned, family tragedies, and family joy."
5,THIS BOOK IS MY HEART,"AFTER REVIEWING ALL THE GREAT COMMENTS ABOUT THE""TREE"" I FIND THAT EVERYTHING I FELT WAS ALREADY EXPRESSED A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS. THE LOVE I FEEL FOR THIS BOOK IS IMEASURABLE. I DISCOVERED IT WHEN I WAS 10 YRS. OLD. I WAS READING A FICTION STORY IN A MAGAZINE, AND THEY MADE REFERENCE TO THAT BK. I AM A VORACIOUS READER AND AT THAT TIME I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOOKS I WOULD LIKE SO I WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR TITLES OF BKS. I HADN'T HEARD BEFORE, AND RUSH TO THE LIBRARY TO CHECK IT OUT. FROM THAT MOMENT ON MY LIFE WAS NEVER THE SAME. FRANCIE TOUCHED MY HEART LIKE NO OTHER CHARACTER HAS. SADLY, THE WOMAN WHO GAVE ME THIS WONDERFUL GIFT HAS LONG BEEN DEAD. GOD BLESS YOU BETTY SMITH FOREVER AND EVER."
4,a tree growing up,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a pretty good book. It was about a girl named Francie and she grew up in Brooklyn with her parents and her little brother, Neeley. It was a pretty good book because it showed you steps of growing up; it started out when she was around six or seven years old and all the way up to college. I would probably recommend this book to someone else to read because it was pretty interesting."
5,My favorite,"I first read this book in the 6th grade. Even then I loved it. I am now in the 10th grade and I have read it 6 times since then. This is my most favorite book in the world. The entire plot is gut wrenching. It's a real page turner. Every time I read it I cry harder then the previous time. It is a long book, but its definatley worth the time."
5,A very good book,"Well, I started another book on my ninth grade reading list after my dad picked up the book at a store in Halifax, NS. When I saw that the book was 80 years old, I was ready to go searching for the cliff notes. But I decided to go for it thinking it might not be that bad. In the beginnining the story was a bit confusing, but later it began to take shape. So I read it, it was done, went to Brooklyn and realized they had many trees."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!,"Hello peoples. I recomend not to read this book. As other readers have stated... it was very boring and 500 pages saying "" my life ..."" so you can read this book if you dont already know that life can .... if you dont know that, you should definitly read this book!!! i repeat... this book is very boring... and i dont recomend it!!!!"
2,Missing tape,"I was planning to use this audio for a reading class. It is a pretty big set of DVD's and DVD #1 is missing. I contacted the dealer and got no resolution. I just wanted the first DVD, or a new set, but it was his only one. It was sealed so it had to be originally packaged with that DVD missing."
3,I didn't like the end,"Although this book is wonderfully written, I at least got tired of the never ending string of depressing incidents and the lousy ending."
3,It's an ok book,"This book catches the eye of many, but to me, it is a book about absolutely nothing. It goes on and on about what is happening in Francie Nolan's life, and the whole time I think ""What does this have to do with anything? I really don't care that Francie saw old men when she was buying bread. Does this have to do with some sort of ending that might happen after 550 pages of boring writing?"" I appreciate and respect that this book is a classic, and it isn't really written in the style as most books are now - a - days, but I just didn't like it AT ALL."
3,Slow Read,It's a slow read for me so far. I'm not finished reading it yet. But I'm curious to know what the hoopla is all about
2,Mixed up pages,"This book was going great until I got to page 60. The next page was missing and was clearly printed that way, not torn out. I flipped through the next few pages and realized that pages were put together all mixed up, so I've had to flip around to keep reading. It's very annoying and confusing. The publisher is Harper Collins. They should be ashamed of themselves. This book is a classic. Get the book, just not this printing."
5,Brought me to tears.,I absolutly loved this book. It was so realistic and had me crying so hard by the end. Sarah
5,My all-time favorite!,"I bought this book in the 5th grade and was absolutely mesmerized by it. Over the past 15 years I have read it over and over again and have appreciated it on a different level each time as I, too, have grown-up with the lead character of ""Francie"". If you have ever wanted to travel in time with your best childhood friend, this novel is one way to experience bustling Brooklyn, New York from the turn of the century through the first World War. I cannot recommend it enough and the movie truly does not do it any justice. A must-read for all ages!"
5,"""One of the best!""","This book is really touching. But for those of you who would rather rent the movie, your missing the point of reading and the plot. Read this book, you'll be sorry if you don't!"
3,a slow paced classic,"A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN came with such rave reviews that i just had to read it and see what i was missing. i cannot say that i find myself any more enriched by this story. it is the early 1900's in brooklyn, NY and francie and her family are forever struggling to make ends meet. it is interesting to see what things the family had to endure and i stuck with it only because i was curious to see how francie's life would unfold. but the story was extremely slow paced and not one of my favorites."
4,Nice historical novel.,"I liked the story about an poor, Irish family living in New York in the early part of this century. They had and inspiring sense of survival. It is true that alcoholism was a blight to society even then."
4,A tree grows in Brooklyn,This book was really worth the time spent reading it. I had seen the movie years ago and I knew the book is always better. So I decided to buy it. It was a little too descriptive but the essence of the story makes up for that.Once I started I couldn't stop. Wow!A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (P.S.)If you like to reminisce read it.
4,"A compelling, historic novel","I've finally gotten the chance to read this book after many recommendations. It was rather hard to put down, with its compelling plot line, memorable characters, and poignant moments. What I found most interesting was its historic portrayal of Brooklyn as a growing neighborhood and home to European immigrants during the early 20th century -- where the beginning of a developing ""American"" political and cultural identity affected the lives of those such as our main character, Francie Nolan."
4,Great Book,I haven't read a book in 10 years. My New Year's resolution was to read more books and this definitely didn't let me down. The story is well written and provides great insight into the early 1900's Brooklyn.
5,Wonderful story,"I hated to have it end. It was a genuine story of American life in the early 20th century, people rising out of poverty."
5,Brilliantly Beautiful,"It's certainly easy to see why this book is a classic. The haunting story of Francie Nolan, a young girl living in poverty in Brooklyn, strikes a chord deep within all of us. Beautifully told, this story draws us into Francie's early-20th century life-her father's drunkenness, her mother's disillusionment with life, her deep love of books- and makes us respond with empathy. This is certainly one of those books that trascends descriptions-it is simply a book about life that has become a classic because of its enduring truths. Betty Smith's strong main character, keen and startlingly truthful observations about life, and stark descriptions make this an unforgettable read-deserving many more than five ""stars."""
5,One of the best books ever,"I first read this book when I was around 13 years old, and I have read it over and over again for almost 30 more years. The story is timeless, the writing lucid, the characters unforgettable. It also takes me to a time and a life I never experienced. An absolute must-have for every bookshelf!"
5,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn: My favorite book,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which is similar to Angela's Ashes, is a great book. Not only is it very personal and emotional, but it also is a reflection on a society. At times it can be so horribley honest; the descriptions are very blunt. Through the experiences of Francie and many other characters, we get a picture of what life was at that time and place. Francie is surrounded by ignorance and poverty. Some of the scenes she witnesses are not very pleasent (for example, the women who gang up on the girl who has a baby and throw rocks at her). But through it all, Francie manages to have a good time. On the last page of the book, i wanted to cry, which says a lot because i NEVER cry in books."
5,deelew,"Wow, this is an excellent example of american historical fiction. I feel as though I am seeing turn of the century Brooklyn through Francie's eyes. If you enjoy fiction with strong characters, details, and bits of history this one is for you. Love it."
5,One of the best books ever written,"As I read this book, I find myself wishing that we valued education as much as the characters in the story. It's a great book, a classic, and one on ""the list"" of books that I want my kids to read when they are old enough."
5,Not just for girls,"I read this book while home from school and ill in 1960. I was 12 and very certainly male. I still remember this vivid, moving, enthalling story while I have forgotten most any details from the usual 'thrillers' that I read in those days.I am not surprised to find that most of the reviewers are female. The central character is a young woman, but her coming of age and coping with the realities of the human condition are pertinent to anyone, anytime."
4,A wonderful tale of the people of Brooklyn,"This book was really moving for me. I read it in 8th grade and still remember it. I especially loved the symbolism of the tree, that was very moving. The characters are very memorable and the language very easy to understand. Some parts get a little tedious but still a great read!"
5,One of the best examples of lasting American literature,"I juts finished reading this book for the first time, and I can tell it is going to be re-read and re-read again and again! The development of the characters and the nuances of the plot make for a brilliant novel, and because this book was originally written in memoir form, the story and characters are completely real and believable. The book unfolds slowly, but never at a boring pace. Everything that happens is fascinating, because it is just the way life really is. This is a MUST-READ for everyone! Possibly the best book I have ever read!"
4,Through a Child's Eyes,"When I was eleven years old I first began reading this wonderful novel. It tells the story of a poor young girl named Francie Nolan who lives in Brooklyn in the earliest years of the Twentieth Century. No work of fiction before or since has to me so captured the wondering observations of a child who lives his life in emotional isolation. The shabby, mean, and colorless streets and tenements of Williamsburg are to Francie a playground of colors, mysteries, and adventures. Francie bears a passionate love for her hopeless, drunken, dreaming father. In contrast, she struggles to love her practical, hardened, and unsentimental mother. This conflict leads to a climax that forces Francie to achieve a balance between the dreams of her father and the practicality of her mother. If you enjoy fiction that allows you to see the world through a child's eyes, this one's for you."
4,"An earnest, good book","I read this book three years ago, when I was in fifth grade. It seemed to be the world's best book then. Now a little wiser and wider in my knowledge of literature, I see this book as an earnest, honorable book. One thing I loved about this book was how the perspective of the book grew more mature as Francie grew up. It makes this book a 'happening book', and draws its readers well into the book while reading. Another excellent technique that Smith used in the book is the way she made littel events seem so important and glorious, the way it would seem to a little girl. It is a touching, rich book, full of emotion and feelings."
5,Excellent reading for just about anyone!,"""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" is my favorite book. All my friends to whom I have described the story are interested in it! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for good reading around the age of 13 or older."
3,Depressin,I had been looking forward to reading this for some time. I was disappointed and I wanted to love it. It was draggy and depressing.
3,A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"This is the first time I have purchased a book that has stated ""good"" condition. I usually get excellent or like new. It's rather old and the pages fall out as I use it but it works for me as long as all the pages are there and I can get through a classic I've always wanted to read. It arrived quickly."
5,ABSOLUTE MUST READ,"This book is a foundation for all others. The author is a master - she has captured a life and preserved it forever for us with her words -- the life is not that of a stranger or just a randome little girl -- there is a piece of every American whose roots stretch back to poor immigrants. Many, many timeless quotes are seeded throughout the novel. I highly recommend this book to all readers!"
3,a tree grows in Brooklyn,"A book worthy of praise for its historical detail, although for me the writing wasn't top-notch."
5,Beautiful,"This book is so well written that you feel like you are living next door to the Nolans and sharing their life.You hope success finds this family, and smile when it does.I really enjoyed this wonderful classic, and will read it again someday."
1,It Stinks,"No climax, no definite plot, no villain. This book breaks the definition of a literary classic and goes off on so many tangents that the reader becomes confused as to what the entire book is actually about, not to mention Francie is a one dimensional charachter who shows little growth until the end of the book where she suddenly changes into an entirely different creature. The novel would have been better if it was solely about Katie!"
1,What a waste of time!,"I am usually fond of mid-twentieth century classics such as this, so when I was assigned to read it for my ninth grade english class, I looked forward to enjoying it. However, I was disappointed to find that it is a horrible and tedious book."
1,A (Diseased) Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details. On several occasions I noted incorrect grammar in the book, and even misspellings! Never before have I seen such a poorly written book. I do not recommend this book. I would not call this book a classic."
1,Don't read this book!,"This is the kind of book that has poor grammer, misspelled words, and is too long. Often times authors make their books drag on and on and on. I feel that is what the author of this book did. I would suggest that you find another book to read and not waist your time."
1,AMAZING BOOK,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book. I'd recommend it to people of all ages. It should be required reading for everyone! An excellent book from cover to cover.
1,Dull,"The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view.The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."
1,Boring,This book was totally boring. Even though it was 1 of the greatest books I've read.HAhahahaha
5,It was good.,"I had to read this book for my summer reading before I went to the 9th grade. I thought that it would be a drag reading it because it was so long, but I didn't really take a long finishing the book. I liked this book because it was very realistic. I could fit right in with Francie. Even though the story took place in the early 1900's, I felt that it could've took place today. I felt an instant connection with Francie once I picked up the book"
4,Great book for book clubs!,I used this for a book club and it was an excellent choice. I wasn't sure it was going to be a success but the members enjoyed it. There are so many controversial topics and differences in lifestyle from that era to today that it really facilitates great discussions. The questions in the back of the book that are provided for use in book clubs were great.
5,Mistaken for the kind of book I usually avoid,"Knowing only that this book was written a long time ago and has been in print for many decades was all the information that I had. I knew it featured an urban family in 1900 NYC, and my understanding stopped there. One day Audible.com had a ""classics"" sale and I picked this up and stashed it away on my MP3 player. Eventually I listened. In short orded I double-bought this magnificent novel for my Kindle and read along as I listen. Then I shared my Kindle edition with all my friends and family, who were equally impressed. There is no stopping this book. I delivers history like no textbook ever will, and human insight, depth and drama, that no film ever could."
4,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Review,"Although this book was intriguing and interesting, there were a few things I didn't like about it. For me, it didn't get that interesting until half way through the book. Also, there seemed to be many irrelevant details and characters. I still enjoyed reading it as it had a unique plot and kept me interested."
3,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"Book recd was not up to the rating it was given by seller.The story was excellent. The central character was so realistic, I expected to find her sitting in my living roorm."
4,A Classic,I enjoyed re-reading this book with my book group and discussing the life of that time in a place we all know well.
3,So helpful for understanding the life of the under-class in that era,"As a reader outside of the U.S., I am not so familiar with the society and life during that era. This book provides the vivid background information. I find the details of her life and family satisfy my curiosity much more than the plot. I read some paragraphs to my 8-year-old daughter and she loves it!"
4,Good Read,"Written in the third person, this certainly is Francie's story. The reader gets drawn into the poverty culture of the immigrants of Brooklyn during the years prior to WWI. The characteristics of the tree matches the strengths of the women especially Francie, her mother, Aunts and grandmother. It is a well written story, although perhaps a bit sterotypical. A story of courage and determination. A good read."
5,Soul Gripping Story,"This is an incredibly amazing novel...which i believe is actually an autobiography of the author. In ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"" the reader is taken through an incredible path of the main character, Francie Nolan's life. From the death of her father, to her assult in a dark hallway, to this amazing girl supporting herself into college, this book finely illustrates the transition from girl to woman. This story takes the reader back to a childs perspective, and also helps one to remember to take time to appreciate the smaller things in life."
5,"No question, it deserves all the accolades","As a lifetime voracious reader, I'm not sure how all this time has passed without me having read this wonderful book. Any novel that can captivate me for 500 pages has got to be something extra special, and this one did. It has everything you want in a novel, great writing, superb characters, humor, sadness, joy and pain. I loved every word. There is really nothing more to be said, if you have not read this book you are truly missing out on something magical."
3,It's an Iffy Story,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I agree, is an excellent book. However, it does not have much action. It seems like the author keeps telling the same thing over and over: Francie Nolan and her family are poor and have to do whatever they can to survive.Throughout about 3/4 of the story, Francie experiences being poor and growing up in Brooklyn, doing whatever she can to live a successful life. Near the end, she finally starts to become more independent and learn more about the real world.This story took me a long time to read, probably because the first 3/4 of the book are so slow. I would reccommend this book, but have patience, because it doesn't get very good until the end."
4,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,The book arrived in a timely fashion. It is in very good condition with only minor stains on the edges of the pages.
3,You'd love it.......if you are a girl.,"I thought that ""A Tree grows in Brooklyn"" was a very well written book. Yet, I am a boy, and the sort of topics hand-picked by Smith didn't appeal to me. This was issued to me through the summer reading program at my high school. Being dissapointed with the previously picked ""Anne Frank"", I figured this would be the typical, mushy, girl book. Yet it was very moving and kept me reading. If you like this, I would recommend anything about the Great Depression. See ya!"
5,this book reminds us of pride in self reliance,"I read this book for history and curiosity, I discovered our lost pride as a society in self reliance and perserverance without government or charity handouts no matter how poor. It's a lesson for all of us today, told in wonderful prose and unvarnished detail."
5,Beautifully Written,"This is a beautiful book. I have loved it for 20+ years and read it more than 20 times. Every time, it is as if I become a part of Francie. She is a daughter, a niece, a younger sister, the neighbor, the friend....she is so real to me. Look beyond the poverty to the wealth, beyond the filth to the clean heart, beyond the wrongness to all that turns out right, all because of Francie's strength of character. This is a story that may be over 50 years old, but is just as new as if it were written yesterday."
3,Just OK.,"Another depressing book picked by my book club. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. It gave a really moving story of what it was to be poor in this country in its early years. Really made you think how much we have now. Also, gave you much insight on the struggles that immigrants had when they first came to the land of opportunity. It was not a face paced book. Took me awhile to get through it. I finished it so that says that I liked it somewhat. It made for an interesting book club discussion. However, it was just too slow for me."
4,"Good, but too long","I did enjoy this book, but at some parts I felt the author could have done without. Some places have too many details and over explain; I got it the first time....the book is about a family, focusing on Francie as she grows up in Brooklyn, beginning in 1912. pre WWI. It's about loss of innocence in many ways, the harsh cruelty of life and the sacrifices that must be made, and the downfall of Francie's mind after a tragedy, dealing with her emotions, not being favoured by her mother and finding herself through the experiences of her life, her job and war. Francie triumphs in the end,and how she gets there is incredible and will leave you feeling like you've a diary of someone who had it harder than you and you will feel better and more confident about yourself and finding the strength to accomplish your goals no matter the hardships that come your way."
5,A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"This book changed my life. Betty Smith has become my favorite author and inspired me to read regularly again. The characters will help young women to learn to accept themselves and understand their feelings. I highly recommend this book along with all of her other books, especially Joy in the Morning."
2,It dragged!,This book took forever in developing the plot. It seemed like I had read a quarter of the book before we even got to the main character. It was also a little predictable when it came to what would happen to her father.
2,A Classic?,I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.
2,Didn't finish,"My bookclub picked this book as every once in a while we do a classic and many in my club had fond memories of this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. I got about half through and was never engaged in it. I found myself skimming much of it and finally decided that I'd move on to something else. I think if you enjoy lots of detailed description, this might be a good book for you. It moved too slowly for me, though."
2,So So....,"I read this book for our book club. The reviews for this book got my hopes high before I started reading it, but disappointed me after I completed the book. Betty Smith wrote this book based on her own life experience, but she did not add any value for the readers who read the book (in my opinion). If you have no interest in experiencing poor childhood or awkward adultlecense, I would not recommend the book."
2,Worst book ever,I don't think I've been forced to read a book so poorly written. You would think Smith could put in at least a little plot and maybe a better point. This book is a dull read and not worth the time or money to buy.
2,Pages are in the wrong order,"The book's cover is in good condition and the pages are in good condition too. Very little wear. The problem is, about 4 chapters in the pages are in the wrong order. I've found this very frustrating - I keep having to flip back and forth through the pages. The seller should have made this apparent in the item's discription."
2,Not Good Condition,I expected the book to be used... even used. What I did not expect was that the cover of the book (including the portion that covers the spine) is attached by a few threads. I don't mind worn. But this condition makes the book hard to read and is inconsistent with how I remember the book being described in the sales materials.
5,The book was fantastic,"Although I have not finished this novel yet, I believe that it is an excellent novel for young readers. The novel describes the life of a young girl names Francie very well. I believe the novel is very hard to put down. It makes me want to keep going on. This is a great novel for anyone."
4,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"I think that this book is very good, and the descrptions are very elaborate. Very interesting book. I enjoyed reading it."
5,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn- a classic,"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a classic. It's a story about a strong, brave, loving, girl growing up in the rough city of Brookly. If you're looking for a book to read, or even a summer reading book, this is a definite choice. Everyone you has read this book has liked it. The author wrote this book in a way that you can understand everything clearly. This is one book you must read!"
5,A great life story,I was assigned this book for a college English class. After reading the first chapter I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. I recommended it to all of my friends. Betty Smith brought Francis and the whole family to life for me. They tugged at my heart and showed me what my greatgrandparetns may have gone through. Thus helped me to connect with relatives I never knew and better understand what their children had to endure. The srtugle and the determination is strengthening. You beleive that what ever hardship you are going through it isn't as bad and you can make it.
5,"""A Tree"" Brings Out Every Emotion","When I read ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" I found that you experience all emotions in it. One time you could be sad, or one time you could be happy. One time you could be so mad that you wanted to put down the book and one time you could be proud of the characters. No matter what, ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" is a very good book for all ages."
3,Very Nostalgic!,I like the book but after reading a few chapters I realized I had seen the movie. I couldn't keep the faces of the actors out of my head. There were many stories of this nature at this time in history and my own life was reflected in many ways in this book.Susie
5,Really Great!!!,The book came in on time it is in really good shape and is so cool. I got it as a gift for my mother and she is going to love it.
4,A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"This book is very nice, I do not have the ""Can't put it down"" syndrome but I often find myself thinking about the Characters and where I think the story is going so I like it because it is not making me stay up ridiculously late to finish it but I do keep thinking about it so I'm happy!"
5,Now one of my top 100 books!,"I keep my favorite 100 books on a shelf next to my computer. After reading this touching, bold, honest biography, I had to bump another book to find a place on my shelf for Smith's gem. It is one of my all-time favorites. R.K. Tipton"
5,It's reputation is well deserved.,"This was a surprising selection for my book club. I had seen the movie years ago and thought it okay. The book describes a period of growing up in difficult times with wonderful use of words and descriptive phrases not dated at all. This is, yet again, a case of the original book being much better than the movie! It is well worth a visit."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I read ""Joy In The Morning"" as a teen, but this one just didn't make my reading list until now, in my 40s. What a great book. I had just finished reading Angela's Ashes and I'd thought, that even though the books are 60 years apart, and one was written by a man about a boy, and the other by a woman about a girl, they were quite similar.They both drew me in and held me. It's incredible to me when an author can touch on something as unpleasant as poverty but not weigh you down and depress you with it. You aren't horrified by it and unable to finish it, and you aren't gobbling it up for morbid thrills as if staring as you pass by the scene of an accident. You come to admire the characters, and dread the last page.This is one that will always be on my shelf."
2,Not so sure anymore,"I have used Bragg's Liquid Aminos (BLA) for a couple decades now, but I'm not so sure anymore. I have read the comments at http://www.welikeitraw.com/rawfood/2005/06/bragg_liquid_am.html (if the link is deleted, do a search for Brag Liquid Aminos at the welikeitraw dot com web site). Glutamic Acid and MSG do naturally occur in foods, so their presence is not an indication that the product is harmful. Claims that the soybeans are broken down with hydrochloric acid and then the acid is neutralized with a base substance, like baking soda. However, BLA does not contain much sodium. So, as an experiment, I am laying off the Bragg's for a while and using natural herbal seasonings like powdered cayenne, garlic, onion, kelp, etc., just to see what happens."
1,TWO THUMBS DOWN,This CD is a compilation of great songs performed poorly by ONE quartet. Buyer beware.
5,Barbershop Arrangements With Excellent Song Selection,"The Square Pegs sound great in this absolutely wonderful selection of songs, many from the 1920's (my favorite era). The group blends well together and the harmonies are not forced.I especially appreciate their version of Paul Whiteman's hit, ""Whispering."" Tea for Two and ""A Cuppa Coffee"" are superb, as is the well-loved classic, ""Lida Rose.""I do not sing barbershop, so my expertise is limited (though I attend the annual concert in my town), but as a listener I am well satisfied with this CD."
3,Correction,"I find in apalling that the song ""Lida Rose"" can be named as ""Linda Rose"" in this song list. At least watch the movie!"
4,Awesome!!!,"Review Clarification: This review is based on my viewing of this movie in the theater, and on Laser Disc. I have not viewed the DVD (any version).This is my favorite Clint Eastwood movie of all time, better than all the Dirty Harry, Spaghetti Western, and Sci-Fi/Space movies.I first viewed this movie in the theater, and I was completely blown away. I am disappointed that John Malkovich has chosen not to be in more mainstream movies, because I immediately wanted to see everything he was in, after watching this movie. (I immediately rented ""Being John Malkovich"" when it became available, and was quite disappointed when he was not the protagonist.) John plays a brilliant Psycho in this movie, and plays it very well. In fact, I actually changed my image of him after this movie. If I were to see him on the street, this is the only memory I would have of him.I recommend this movie highly. One of my favorites.MC White said: Check it out!!!"
2,"Love the smell, hate the peeling","I bought this ""face lotion"" two months ago and for my face, everytime I use it my face peels and I break out in a red rash. I thought it might be a combination of this and another product, but even using Nivea face lotion by itself after two days without any other products (to include soap) causes it (I think I also have peeling issues with their aftershave lotion, so it might be their fragerance). I'm not saying this will happen to you, but figured I would warn others. I'm now just using it on my legs now and it seems to not cause any problems there."
2,HARD TO FINISH,"I found this book not worth the $$, it was well written but too sweet and hard to finish. Definitly not a page turner."
1,A major disappointment!,"I love Los Van Van. However, this CD is a major diappointment. Poor singing combined with poor sound engineering translates into a strong recommendation not to spend your money on this CD. Do yourself a favor and pick another one (""En el malecón de La Habana"" is one of my favorites and is guaranteed to get your feet moving)."
5,The best group from back in the day!!!!,This is one of my favorite albums from my childhood. A real classic.
3,Five Star's uneven debut,"Back in the day Five Star debuted in 1985 with Luxury of Life. There are some great tracks on the album, Let Me Be The One, All Fall Down, Love Take Over, Hide and Seek, RSVP and System Addict all make the grade. There are some not so good tracks also though, Say Goodbye, Winning, Crazy all have poor production values. Off This 1st album Five Star had some hits and rightly so, the weaker tracks should have been omitted and replaced with stronger material."
1,Credit Cards Will Not Fit,All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit.
5,A great toy,My two year old son loves the climber we can not get him off it he would play there all day if he could. It is easy to put together it only take around two hours.
2,Hope you have better luck,I am a stay at home mother and I was really excited to see this product when it came out. I thought that this would have something for both my boys. To my surprise neither one of them was to thrilled with this climber/swing set. The swings are used rarely and I've hardly seen them use the climber. The whole thing is very sun faded after only a year and the platforms for the slides are kinda flimsy. Honestly I expected more from Little Tikes. We have some great toys from that company but this one didn't work out for our family.
2,The Principle of Relativity,"I'm not happy with this book at all. I'm not a scientist outside of the field of information technology and I want something to explain Einstein's theories that I could read. I read such a book when I was young. It's out of print, but you can purchase it on Amazon used. It's entitled ""Relativity: The Special and the General Theory--A Clear Explanation that Anyone Can Understand"" by Albert Einstein.That did it for me, this book put me to sleep."
3,It was an ok movie,"This movie was clever an humorous at times. I thought that the acting was well done and the dialogue as great. Rose McGowan was a great character and made the movie better. I know this is not much of a detailed review, but its my opinion."
2,One Thumb Up and One Thumb Down,"This movie seemed a bit okay. I got the story and everything, but there were some minor parts that really didn't make any sense at all. Well basically, it is about an ""Everyday"" Joe who ends up being ""BEST BUDS"" with the popular boy in highschool after the Vietnam war. Well, the story ended up being a ""Happy"" ending, but some of the parts tends to be a little bit on the psychotic side. Like as if the story was pulling you into thinking that the friends were lovers or that they had a few glasses and what not. NOTE: It is a good movie to watch, but expect to be a little confused in some parts (especially in the bathroom scenes). Although, the movie did have a good opening song..."
3,"A battle-scarred Vet comes home again, and tries to adjust.","This dark, angst ridden film depicts the anxieties of both Veteran's and their families after returning from war. It is the story of one young man's adjustment back into society and the bosom of his family. Between flashbacks, and grating overtures from Mom and Dad and Girlfriend to make things right, it seems like nothing will ever be right again. But with the help of his best-friend, (played by Ben Affleck) he begins to slowly, but surely put things back together for himself, and to enjoy life again, but on his own terms. Moving, emotional and relatible as the boy who never quite fit in, but is now a war hero, this film tells an interesting, compelling story. Ben Affleck plays a ""good ol' boy"" type, who shuns that image after being exposed to the realities of war. I would recommend it for anyone who would like the opportunity to see Ben in one of his best and biggest performances."
2,Disappointing,"The book was one of the most funny I've read, and the film just didn't do it justice. One improvement is that Sonny's character is much sweeter and more likeable in the film than in the book, but the finer points of the story have been lost. The part about the beard, for example, which wasn't just very touching, and funny, but incredibly shocking to someone born in 1964 and had never known a time when beards were downright subversive! All the actors were excellent--but more of the book could have been written into the film.Also, to a previous reviewer, the time frame of the story is in the early '50's--they were NOT returning from the Vietnam War! The Korean War was in the early '50's; the Vietnam War didn't begin till 1964!"
3,"Not cinematic magic, but has redeeming qualities","I actually enjoyed this movie more than its prequel, ""The Heroic Trio"". Usually sequels are lost on me, but there was something a little more honest about this film than the first. The characters are grittier, the plot less focused on gags and cheesy jokes. Anita Mui does a great job with the dramatic material, as does Michelle Yeoh (I would've asked for more of Michelle than her counterpart Maggie Cheung, but oh well).There are still moments where the plot does not add up and things happen simply for dramatic effect, but the movie as a whole works better (in my opinion) than the first. Be prepared for a pretty depressing ending, though.Still... 3 out of 5 stars."
2,two hours of my life I'll never get back,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's horrible. That's a particularly sad thing to say after Heroic Trio is one of the best Hong Kong movies in a long time. I'm not sure if I'm annoyed with Michelle Yoeh's prolonged death or her prolonged presence with nothing to do for the rest of the movie, or the fact that the husband is killed 20 minutes into the movie.It's not just that this is one of the dumber Hong Kong movies I've seen, it's also that it had a potential to be really great. It has great stars, it's a sequel to an amazing movie and it just falls flat. Too many places where nothing's happening, dumb jokes, awful musical montages and the fight scenes don't excite me.Nothing really to recommend in this movie. I suppose if you are a diehard fan of Anita Mui, Michelle Yoeh or Maggie Cheung (whose better in Green Snake) watch it, but be prepared to be disappointed."
4,Great pajama shirt,I kept this shirt for three years. It was extremely soft and comfortable and I used it as a night shirt. I did not use it for work or events at all.
4,Good shirt for a good price,"I am using this shirt for over a year now and its still running good. For the price, this shirt is too good. The quality is comparable to some of the branded ones present in the market."
2,Value for money - fair,"I have this in all 3 colors, and only the blue color looks fine. The other two colors, I don't think I would like to wear to office where I am a mid-manager level. Reason being that the fabric is a blend hence thinner than the normal 100% cotton shirts that I prefer. Looking at the retail price of the shirt, I was expecting something better."
3,"Important, but slow and redundant","So far, the first section of the book has been terrible redundant, with one paragraph reiterating the one above it.The main point (I can save you 100 pages of reading here) is that induction cannot be the holy grail is ispurported to be because just because something happened in the past does not mean it will happen in the future.Expect to see that point restated dozens of times. Okay, I get it!The second section has started to pick up, moving through the Ptomely, Copercinuus debates and into Newton.His perspectives and insights are interesting. But if you're like me, this will be a few-page-a-night sort of read. I'llget back to you as I progress..."
3,Quite impersonal,This book reads like a manual and was not as helpful or accessible as Caged in Chaos by Victoria Biggs.
5,Superb music for relaxation,I bought this CD having previously purchased Nick Kemp's spoken word CDs. The music on this CD takes you on a deeply relaxing journey and is ideal for anyone who wants to destress or simply likes ambient trance style music!
5,Concise and comprehensive,"This book is a complete study guide that fits the needs of engineers as well as those of newcomers to the field. Its most important feature is the way the author allows students with a little background in mathematics to go through all the topics presented without getting lost or discouraged. The purpose is achieved with a simple but efficient strategy: an easy to follow level is the main body of the book and a lot of examples provide the reader with all the tools necesary to grasp the basics. The higher level material (advanced mathematics) is therefore not indispensable to actually understand Image Enhancement, Image Restoration, Preparation for Automatic Vision, and a little bit of Image Compression."
3,Good Book,"It's a very good book in theoretical part, BUT the practical exercises contain many errors; I suggest an accurated revision to the next edition."
3,"Uh, what about the title?","Well, this book was altogether well done, but honestly the title, ""Just Another Kid"" would almost imply that it would be about the CHILDREN. They spend way too much time focused on the alcoholic woman in the book instead of the actual students, who were far more interesting. I would recommend other Torey Hayden books over this one."
3,Sad and Mad,"Those are the two words that summed up this book for me. When I was through raeding it all I felt was sad and mad. There was a child in it (not mentioning his or her name) that the whole time I honestly felt needed a good spanking since obviously nothing else was going to work. It made me think back to each child who I wasn't able to help and the horrible things that had later on happened to them.Whle this book is good I recommend it in doses as it made me way too angry to read in one sitting. Your typical loveable Hayden children are here, but there is a viper among them"
5,Just another kid,"All Torey Hayden`s books are fascinating. Easy reading for the layman, no fancy psychological terms. Excellent reading. What an incredible psychologist and writer. I have read every book she has written and would read any new ones."
3,This actually gets 3 1/2 stars from me,"I have read Torey's GHOST GIRL, MURPHY'S BOY, ONE CHILD and THE TIGER'S CHILD and found them all to be excellent so I was pretty disappointed with this book. I can't exactly pinpoint why, though.Maybe it was that it focused on multiple children rather than just one or maybe it was that it was focused so much on Ladbrooke, a mother of one of Torey's students. Yes that was probably the reason. We read more about Ladbrooke than we did about the children and their problems and that was very dull."
5,im just another kid,"im an adult now but i act like a kid because of my mental illness. i can relate to ladbrooke (not acohal mind u but the illness in my brain. torey helps the children and ladbrooke. she had an inicent about her. i disagree about leslie. I think she was really austic and couldnt help the way she acted. because people cant see the disability they wonder why we act the way we do. its not leslie and geraldines faught. geraldine grew up in a war torn country for gods sake so what can u expect?! she was only a child. so dont put them down. the book was good i want to know what happened to these children, especally geraldene. chin up girl!!"
5,Silk Stalkings Season Four,I've been a fan of this show for so many years and when I found out it was on box set I know I had to have it. I only like the seasons with Rob Estes and Mitzi Kapture and all I need now is season five but I can seem to find out when it is going to be released. I guess I will just have to wait and see!!!
5,THe best!,This is the best silk season ever!! Except for them killing off the greatest guy ever! It has lots of passion and chemistry.
1,"""Please Check Disc""","I had an error message ""Please Check Disc"" when I attempted to play Disc 2, episodes 9-12. Everything else in Season 4 was okay.I notified the manufacturer that Silk Stalkings Season 4, Disc 2 was defective. They sent me a replacement which was Season Two, Disc 4. I notified them by email about a week ago that they sent me the wrong replacement. My email was not acknowledged.Hopefully they won't hold me accountable for their errorIf I receive the correct replacement I will rate the series 4 stars, otherwise, my 1 star rating will be it."
5,Great!,"The t-shirt was perfect for when my nephew went to the hospital to see his little sister for the first time! It was soft, comfy, and adorable! The shirt was shipped and recieved very fast!!"
4,This is what I wanted,I picked this because I like the colors to match the baby sister outfit I had bought. My son is a small 8 yr old and fits in small-medium size 7-8 shirts. I picked the medium because I read other reviews saying it runs small. Well the medium says 10-12 on the tag. I really wish they would of put that in for sizes instead of me guessing. I'm going to let him grow into it. That's the only reason I give it a 4. The quality of the shirt is good although he hasn't worn it yet.
1,ME Me Me Me Me Me Me,"What an incredible disappointment! Is one star as low as I can go? Nothing, lots and lots of nothing, is what this book contains. Unless you like to read, over and over again, the words Me, I, My, Me, I, I and Oh yes, ME, don't bother. Where is the Beef? I have never seen such a narcissistic endeavor. It was a total waste of money and expectation. The hype I received from the E-Zine Queen convinced me I should buy this book. That's the one and only chance she had to gain my respect. It seems a club of mutual admirers got together and decided to endorse this shallow, boring fake. What a shame. Count me out of this network of self admirers. I have been robbed."
5,A well-done blueprint to personal and financial success,"Just got the book and couldn't put it down! The combination of writing personality, practical tips and Stephanie's personal story of tragedy and triumph make this a must-have book."
5,What a great read!,"Stephanie's personal story is a great read and full of tools to produce the results you want in your life and business. Stephanie tells it like it is and writes just like she speaks and, if you have met Stephanie, you know this is delightful. You really shouldn't miss this if you are searching to improve your business results. Most of all, enjoy!"
2,A Good Surprise and a Let Down!,"I had seen the Batman video years ago on youtube where he battled the Joker, Predator, and Aliens. That led me to this movie Hunter/Prey, since the leading actor had played Batman in that video years ago. I read some of the reviews and thought, ""What the heck!"" Unfortunately, this movie was a waste. It had tones of the old Dennis Quaid movie Enemy Mine, but sadly it didn't have the heart that movie did. The plot was silly and the acting was terrible. It's one of those movies where it's not bad enough to turn off, but when you do finish watching it, you'll wish you hadn't wasted the time. There was potential, but I would guess the writing is to blame in this circumstance. As far as Sleep Dealer, it wasn't anything to write home to mom about, but out of the two it was definitely the better movie. I actually found parts of it interesting and even thought the ending was somewhat silly, I felt better about the experience on this one."
2,Way too religious,"I was looking for a book about dolphins, sharks and fish as a primer for my kids prior to our trip to Sea World. While this book has some nice photos and some interesting facts about sea life, it is also filled with religious propaganda -- which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but I wasn't and now I seriously regret the purchase. I think the description should have been much more clear about the preaching contained in the book - the single reference to ""God"" was an insufficient warning."
5,Loved it Sooooooooooooooo Much!,"I can't believe some of the ratings I've read on this book that were Negative! This is an abosolute fantastic book, the photographs are superb, the rooms are fantastic! This is one of the best design books I have seen before. I wish that more were this colorful and diverse in its presentations! Thanks for allowing me to review this wonderful publication."
1,SIGNATURE STYLE,"I found this book to be extremely boring. While the pictures were done well, the content was way too traditional and museum-like. The rooms didn't look like anyone could live in them, and that the furniture ought to be slipcovered in plastic like some of our Grandparents homes."
1,Signature Style,"I subscribe to Traditional Home magazine and have purchased their other books. Signature Style was a terrible disappointment. It lacks the interesting, informative style for which they are known. Pictures and text are below par. Gives you the feeling this was done by some other entity who dashed it off without much thought. Save your money."
2,Dissappointing at Best,"The book does not live up to Traditional Home's reputation of quality work. Frankly, I can find better photos and design insite from magazines than what I found in this book. It's easy to understand why there are so many people wanting to sell the copies they have. It is honestly a disppointment if you are used to truly inspiring design publications. If you decide to buy this book, do yourself a favor and purchase a used copy. Even at Amazon's reduced price it's still over priced for what you get."
1,signature style,"i was very dissappointed in this book. nothing new or fresh. photography is really unispiring. too tradtional and old fashioned, nothing innovative here."
4,Interrogation Techniques,"Interrogation TechniquesOreste Pinto's ""Spy Catcher"" is about the art of catching and interrogating spies and special forces operators as practiced by a Dutch expert who worked for the British during World War II. In the first chapter, the author lists the qualities of the ideal counter-spy. Chapter two, deals with the extraction of information from suspects without using physical force to retrieve the information. The next eight chapters deal with actual cases and the author's role in them. In the eleventh and final chapter the author stresses the importance of perfecting our counter-intelligence procedures. This work is a highly interesting and readable book on a complicated art and science of interrogation."
3,Super Tiny,"Space Shuttle is of very good quality and detail considering how very small it is. It is about the size of a small Hot Wheels car. My two year old likes it a lot, but we were expecting it to be bigger as there was no detail in the product review at the time we ordered it. Expect to pay about 4 times the cost of the item for standard shipping from the vendor. Product shipped in a box about 40 times the size of the item."
1,unhappy,Don't waste your money on these unless you have an old computer. They will not fit over the keys on newer models.
1,Oil Field Chemicals misses the mark,"The book ""Oil Field Chemicals"" is limited to superficial generalizations and lists of chemicals without a critical review or insights into chemical interactions. It is a diappointment to anyone looking for an in-depth coverage of oilfield chemicals."
1,BIG NAMES/POOR RESULTS,Sorry BUT this entire production left me coldabsolutelyZERO WARMTH OR PASSIONVIEWED IT TWICE AND THEN HAPPILY SOLD IT
2,It doesen't worth it...,This is a book where the author tells about his own expirience on self therapy in order to accept the fact that he isn't as good as he would like to be in his professional area (despite he thinks he is teaching how to run a good life - i.e. finding hapiness despite you don't have the recognition that you would like in your professional area). Perhaps it can be helpful for someone who doesen't have a grate consciousness about him/herself and/or face the same problem of the author.
3,Happy Tears,"This movie is the story of two sisters taking careof their ailing father. It is a weird movie withmany flashbacks and dream like scenes.I like action movies, and this was not my kind ofmovie. However, if you like movies that deal withrelationships with some humour this is a goodmovie to watch.Demi Moore and Parker Posey acting was very good.I do remember Ellen Barkin from the movie Big Easy, shewas really hot in that movie. And yes it was thatmemorable. :) Wow, what a difference!"
2,Sorry this one is boring,"Figured it had potential to be funny. But is wasn't, and not very interesting. Can't reccomend this movie to anyone."
5,Amazing movie,"Totally loved this movie. It was funny, sad and crazy too. Parker Poesy, Demi Moore, and Rip Torn are fabulous!"
1,horrible film,Please dont waste a second of your life watching this film. Roy Lichtenstien's brilliants starts and ends on the cover.
3,It was just ok,"Happy Tears is basically the story of two sisters dealing with the deterioration of there dying father. I found this movie to be very moving. Both Demi Moore and Parker Posey give very strong believable performances. This movie also has a solid script. I don't see it winning many awards but it's definately not a bad movie. It seems like something that would have been made especially for the Lifetime network. You will not get bored watching this film. However, There is nothing really new here. This definately falls in the cateogory of Chick Flick. I give this movie ONE ENDEARING THUMBS UP. This little film has a lot of heart. All you ladies might want to check this one out. You guys can suck it up and watch it too. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. HOLLA"
2,not as great as,"not as great as i thought. brought it because it was costing me $10 per tube. have been applying it for about 3 weeks now and saw little difference. you have to keep reapplying the gel to get some type of a result. i had used other products just once for about 6 months and they had worked much better - buy the more expensive stuff (maxforce or advion), dont go for their price!"
3,"Wouldn't Call it ""Magic""","When I first heard of this product I said to myself, ""How cool, it's MAGIC."" As a long-time believer in both the powers of fruit (especially the tropical varieties) and magic (only ""white"" though!), I thought that this lotion would be the answer to all my foot-related prayers. Well, take it from me, although this product IS a lotion for feet, it is in no way magical (I tested it with a crystal AND my divining rod, so I know what I'm talking about). So, if you want just a plain old mango foot lotion, go ahead and buy this product, but don't expect any magic!"
3,"Entertaining, light reading","This is my first time to read a short story collection, and my first time to read Forsyth. All ten stories were amusing but nothing startling or shocking. All stories were lighthearted, with no violence, sex or swearing.Some reviewers mentioned each story ending with a twist, and that intrigued me because the ""twist"" ending hadn't gained popularity when these stories were written.The twists were all pretty obvious but still each story was easy and fun to read."
1,Not What I Expected,"I looked forward to this celebration CD very eagerly. However, the disappointment was great other than Gretchen Davis. I've been a fan of Kristofferson for 35-40 years and that could be the problem. There are very few people who can sing his songs - Johnny, Waylon, Willie, and Kris. I far preferred and really love the ""This Old Road"" CD.Donna"
1,Awful. Better tributes and far better renditions available,"Start with ""Willie Nelson Sings Kris Kristofferson."" Better yet, get anything recorded by Kris, himself, until the last decade or so. Despite having a voice that ""sounds like a frog,"" as he once put it, the early versions are best by Kristofferson, because nobody else conveys the same feelings or sings his lyrics with such expressiveness as he does. Even his performances are just too rote in live performance or later rerecordings, though."
1,Lackluster CD,"The music was very disappointing. I should have trusted my instincts when I listened to the clips, but I had high hopes for this much-anticipated CD. Save your money!"
3,Definitely not Dean Martin!,"Suffering from emotions concerning the death of his partner in France, Matt Helm decides he deserves a holiday in Hawaii. But Mac reckons since Helm is going to lounge on the beaches of that part of the world, he can also carry out a small job. Suddenly, Helm's therapeutic vacation has turned into a cat and mouse game of ferreting out a traitor who may be aided by two suspicious ladies."
5,Hooray that I found this!!!,"[NOTE: The product listing is in error. The label should be listed as Columbia/Sony.]I have several Doris Day CD's, all of them spectacular. This one is quickly overtaking Day By Day/Day By Night (on Collectables) as my favorite. Doris cannot disappoint; there is not a dud in her entire song catalog. This CD is a ""2 on 1"" Sony import (from the UK, I think). These hi-fidelity stereophonic recordings both sound great - no gripes - they sound like they could have even been recorded yesterday! Doris sings flawlessly, as always. Even the most casual listener will enjoy these albums; for Doris fans they are required equipment.This is now out of print and hard to find. If you come across it in the used CD store, BUY IT AT ALL COSTS!!!! I came across it in a second hand CD store in Madison, WI recently for 1/5 of the current used price here at Amazon."
4,Pretty good halter,"I have tried every halter on the market and this is probably the best. It is not the easiest to use, but once you get the hang of it, it is pretty easy. The cons: The sherpa sleeves ride up and down so I stitched them in place. The cord has become twisted and it is hard to move the slider thing up and down. Overall, it is pretty good. It help one of my dogs a lot; the other, unfortunately, only a prong collar will work on her."
5,Real guys writing about real life,"I love this group, saw them in England in 2005, going to see them summer of 2007! Outstanding live performance, both are gifted musicians. Miranda that sings with them now is talented as well. Their songs are about real issues and towns and villages in the West Country, but you can relate to them even if you aren't from their. I play their music in the car and house and my kids can sing along to just about every song. - sorry, but most radio station songs are all about sex and conquests, enough of that garbage. Give me 3 folk singers in a pub near Wells any day!!!"
1,Incompatible with Kindle,"Make sure you view the sample first. Most of the characters particular to Spanish and linquistics show up as gibberish and on most pages the formatting seems to be lost. It is obvious that no one at the publisher even glanced at this to see if it worked when it was converted. Amazon can share responsibility. At the time of this review Kindle developers are still exclusively Anglo-centric. I hope they eventually see the value in adding some foreign language support (yes, Amazon, there are some people that read Spanish in the United States...)."
1,Buyer Beware - Another Rip-off,"Buyer Beware - Another Rip-off. An hour ago I thought that I was buying this dictionary. What I received instead on my AmazonKindle was The New Oxford American Dictionary. This is not the first times that I have been cheated like this, but I assure you that it will be the last!"
3,zombie survival or emotional struggles?,"This book was a very odd yet interesting read. I personaly thought that the book would be about surviving the zombie apocolypse struggling to survive mass hords and finding recources, instead the story focuses mostly on there characters emotional struggles and human on human conflict. In most of the book the author keeps letting you into the characters heads about there fears and emotional struggles of what the world was and what the world is now.He also creates man on man (woman) conflict between the characters which becomes boring at times because they fight at such simple tasks such as whether or not to go into the house. finaly after about 2/3 of the book it finaly picks up and starts to have the zombie conflict. although this is the first book of the autumn series. it dosent draw much attention for someone who is looking for a thriller/horror novel."
3,Lots of siting,The book got me interested but takes a while to really get started. But once events start taking place the book picks up and you get pulled in wondering what happens next.
2,Weak,"Yes, I'm a zombie fan, both real and pseudo. Still, this book is a bit of a snore.Now if the book is about people in survival mode instead, then Moody doesn't seem to understand individual differences and the broad range of ""fight or flight"" reactions at all. All I can figure is that his characters must reflect his own truncated response. And where are the characters with the truly good problem-solving skills? Weak.This was like the time I saw the ""Blair Witch Project"" and was puzzled when the characters kept wandering around in circles. I'm an urbanite and still I kept thinking, ""Why don't you just follow the river back?"" In ""Autumn"" because the evolving zombies seemed to best orient toward noise, I kept thinking ""Why don't you just come up with some sort of simple missile device to create noise and distract these suckers?"" Molotov cocktail, anyone?Real or pseudo, there are much better zombie stories out there."
3,PG-13 Zombie Apocalypse,"I did like this book and thought about giving 4 stars. I didn't because I am a gorehound. I expected hardcore Zombie violence, but there was none to be found. If you are looking for splatterpunk, this is not for you. I say this because I have read and watched very graphically violent books and movies about Zombies. I enjoy the over-the-top gore that is usually associated with Zombies.""Autumn"" is a good book even without the gore I love so much. The book is well written and character driven. The pace gets slow at times, but the apocalyptic mood is always there. There are some exciting moments and some fast paced action, and the Zombies are scary. Even I was creeped out by the Walking Dead in this book.You should understand this is the first book in a series of 5 so far. I have already read the next book in the series ""Autumn:The City"". The story continues and expands in the second book."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZ,I've got one word for you: BORING! Just the thought of reading several sequels to this snooze-fest is enough to make me drowsy.
2,Eh Is All I Can Really Muster,"When i first read the plot for this book, it sounded good. Maybe not original in the Zombie genre (i'v only found Sandman Slim Kill The Dead original in the genre). But god i did not expect it to kill me with boredom. I am a avid reader but i had to push myself to finish this book, it was slower than the undead it chronicled. Also i didn't care by the end of the book which of the main charters died...i was actually hoping for it . The mere thought of trying to read the others in the series... frightens me. Unless David Moody's style of writing changes and actually gets some life to it...i wont be reading further novels from him."
2,Repeated phrases are annoying.,"This book series gets annoying. Every character in the book is a whining sissy. The author repeats a few phrases more times than I would like to read. The lack of creative writing along with the characters whining, irritates me. If you like zombie novels were everyone sits around and sobs about how pathetic and confused they are. Then this is your novel. This book is bad, but it has some good qualities. The second book (the city), however, is just more of the same and worse. I'm 100 pages into The City, and I feel like a chump for giving this publisher more of my money. In both books there has been the introduction of more than a hundred characters, and out of all of them not one is going on a zombie killing rampage.Autumn doesn't compare to other great zombie adventures like Day By Day Armageddon or Tooth and Nail.This is one story that isn't worth the time or money."
4,"true to zombie form, slow, decaying and long lasting.","This book offers a delicious blend of isolation, survivalism and the undead. A satisfying selection of character personalities that paint a perfectly hopeless situation.Not for those who like fast paced, shoot em up zombie thrillers. Some are upset with dialogue, whereas I feel it keeps with the bleak tone of the book.A very satisfying beginning to a series that looks extremely promising."
2,Not the best in zombies,"I was very excited about reading this book, especially knowing it was a series. The hope to carry characters through a cataclysm is one that intreges me. Unfortunatly, although the concept around the story is a good one, the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They are either bickering or whining, even close moments when you feel that they are going to connect it turns into a confronation. At the end I really didn't care if they lived or died.And the language is unbelievably harsh, yes, I don't mind the occasional f-bomb, but at times it seemed unrelenting. If you agree with this review and have read the other books and Mr Moody's writing style has changed please let me know."
2,Autumn,"I really tried to like this book. I probably made it halfway.The book dragged and was quite boring. In an attempt to make the zombies ""different"", I thought the author failed miserably. I kept waiting for something to happen and... nothing. One reviewer said the last 75 pgs were great. Huh?I couldn't keep the characters straight, I ended up taking notes. That being said.... the characters were hateful. Nothing redeeming whatsoever. E very page (just about) kept asking.... are you okay?It was odd how close they got to the zombies.... even bringing one into their refuge without knowing if they were contagious.Lastly, it always amazes me that during TEOTAWKI nobody really cares about their lost ones (except one guy). If my family were across the ocean, you bet your butt I'd be looking for a row boat.I have no intent to read a sequel.... I really don't care what happens to these morons."
3,Some good some bad..,"The whole autumn series.. If your not used to actual english style writing, you will possibly find it slow, boring, or annoying in some way. This series isn't too bad with it, but its there. The story is really good, but for long expanses it seems the characters just sit around and whine, for chapters at a time. The action parts of the book are really good, but these long expanses of supposed hopeless despair suffered by the characters, also truely gets felt by the reader, due to how boring it gets to hear some brits whine and cry about losing their families. I guess it's pretty realistic on that part, because the end of the world would be pretty horrible. But it also made it pretty hard to force myself to keep reading each of the books from this series. I think the only reason I continued to read them was because I already bought the whole set, and so I can count them in my collection of zombie books I've read."
4,Intense,"This is the first zombie book I've read. A fan of the Walking Dead, I wanted a story with some substance about the catastrophe and its after effects. I wanted a story about the people and how they figure out how to survive. I did not necessarily want a macho, violent story about ripping apart the zombies. I got it in Autumn. It's a good book, not a great one. The story is intense and leads to a great climactic ending. I was ready for book 2, which I'm working on now. It seems even better than the first. So it appears this first book is a warm up to an ever improving story and improving writing."
3,Missing Depth and Character,"This is by no means the worst book I have read, but I could never shake the dark feeling that I was being cheated somehow. I wanted to root for the characters, but I found myself caring less over the course of the read instead of more. While I wanted depth and complexity to the characters, they were shallow and contradictory. Ultimately, I could not connect with them and wished they would just die already.The storyline was only marginally better and too many twists just felt.contrived."
2,A Prosaic Sleepy Season,"David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies, but a strongly character driven book.Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull, and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out, and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists, than several trips to the grocery store, lots of soup being consumed, and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades."
3,"Character development is good, but no action.","I have to agree with much of Mr Goddard's review. The story is like walking in dense woods - you wonder how long before you get to the other side. Since this is a the first of a few books and it was a FREE download, I'm going to give the series a fair shot with the next book. If the progress stays this slow, I am out.Detail is good and character development as well, but for so much time spent with the characters, you'd think you'd know their backgrounds better. Zombie encounters had a unique take with their own development, but they were limited. Honestly this feels more like half a book and perhaps it was the author's intention.So overall, it's not a bad book, but it is incomplete. The next volume may flesh it out.Look up Moody and Autumn on Google and you'll find the author's website with the download. I read it in about 3 hours."
1,Plodding lack of action,"Nothing happened from beginning to end. No action, certainly no bloody zombie action. It was like ohhhh the dead have risen lets try and stay away from them if we can."
2,"Strangely compelling, but not really all that great","I gave this book two stars because of its original approach to an old idea. The zombies in this book (called ""bodies."" The z word is never used.) were different enough to draw my attention.Unfortunately, that is really all this book had going for it. The author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies. I was told over and over that the survivors were afraid, but I saw no compelling reason for that.If you do decide to try this book, because of all the (wtf) 4+ reviews everywhere, I recommend you (a) get it from the library and (b) stop at book one."
4,...,This was my first taste of Mr. Moody's writting. I am now a devout fan of his books. This is a book that should not be passed up by people who like zombie/apocolyptic books.
2,A British Zombie tale....,"I read a lot of Zombie books, some good, some bad. ""Autumn"" is in the latter category, it is slow too get moving and the British terminology is off putting. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this book."
1,WTF?,"I don't understand is this book made of gold or gasoline? Why the hell does it cost sooo much? Does the author David Moody come to your home and actually read the book to you? When you order this book do you get 25 copies? I have many more questions about this book, but I don't wish or want to waste my time. Hope this review helps, maybe when I get back from overseas, get out of the military, sell my home or first born just maybe I will be able to afford such a luxurious book. This explains why the local library doesn't have the book."
1,Not for me,"At first when I realized this book had been taken up my a mainstream publisher I thought great I will definitely give this one a chance since I am a huge fan of everything zombie related.I do regret buying this book. It's not often that I have regrets about something I have purchased but this is one of those times.The story is nothing special or in fact, new. The writing reads amateurish and when I was finished reading I knew I definitely would NOT go any further into this series.For fans of the genre, if you are looking for action stay away. This book was rather mundane and boring."
2,Struggling to find fresh meat,"Here's how to make a good idea go bad in about 300 pages: sloppy and repetitive writing, careless characterization, zombies that aren't scary, and a story that shambles around as aimlessly as one of the undead it describes.For an example of this, see David Moody's 'Autumn,' a book which starts out strong, promising a fresh spin on the zombie story but delivering something stale and dull.I'll say this much - it's refreshing to read a first book in a series and be left with no desire to continue reading the rest. Life's too short to read bad books, and 'Autumn' was enough for me."
3,Pretty good chiller,"Just finished this book and although it needs a better proofreader, it was really quite good. Really made me want to read the next book to see what happens next. Hope his writing improves, because I want to read more."
4,UK Writer does well!,"Moody's book takes place in the UK and has a different set of the typical Romeo zombie. The characters are built up very well, and the reader can feel the tension, not only with the zombie, but between the survivalists as well. I think that Moody did a lot of research to make this book as realistic as possible. The only reason it did not get five stars was because I thought the book was a little slow in the middle section."
4,Socially awkward zombification,"Unlike his American counterparts, Mr. Moody doesn't go for the cranial shotgun blast style of zombie horror. His protagonists aren't heroes. They are socially awkward, chronically depressed and in a state of deep shock following the biblical disaster that has befallen the planet. This is the most realistic plague tale that I have read to date. A great book and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
5,The best,"So far, this is my favorite post-apocalyptic series. It is truly POST the apocalypse. Ths is what I enjoy: finding out what comes next. This series is inventive and well-written. if you stick through to the end of the series you will feel great satisfaction if the post-apocalypse is something you enjoy reading about. This series has just the right balance of zombie, zombie explanation, zombie science and survival. Some authors waste too much time explaining how we got here. This book offers us just enough explanation to enjoy the story of what comes next."
1,Abysmal,"I was quite disappointed after reading Autumn. Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book, thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were ""my kind of thing"" (and they still are). However, Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes, but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like, ""here are the characters, now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations."" I felt no sympathy with Carl's death, or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall, this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever. Although the abysmal stance of Autumn, Moody is an amateur, and will hopefully progress in later writings."
1,Disappointment is mine,"I am mad at myself for wasting ten bucks on this book! The plot was slower than a turtle swimming in a pool full of yogurt. The characters were boring and I never felt any connection to any of them. The zombies were equally as boring. I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning, when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma, Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the ""As the World Dies"" trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced, full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the ""Autumn"" series."
4,Great but you will see the dirty soles :-),"The shoe rack is good. It looks nice and easy to assemble. It is also easy to adjust according to the shoe sizes.I have couple of concerns. One - As other people have mentioned, it is not very easy to put on the big shoes. It is very comfortable to put in my kids and my wife shoes. However, when I hang my shoes, I have literally squeeze them in. Second - When you put all the shoes, you will see the back of the shoes for the ones hanging on the front. The pictures never show the tree with all the shoes filled in, so I never realized that it does not look as beautiful as shown in the pictures."
2,Not satisfied.,"I recently bought this shoe rack for my husband but after hanging the shoes, the rack started to wobble. It is not standing as it should, I have to rest it against the wall"
3,Whitney Design 2134 Chrome Revolving 4-Tier shoe Tree,First the shipment was really great... I did receive my order at an unexpected date (earlier!). Thanks.I don't know if some washer was missing or other part because it didn't stand straight as it was supposed to.. altough I tried to balance the shoes around each tier..so I am a little bit disappointed..
4,Pretty nice for the value,"The rotating shoe rack is easy to assemble and very sturdy. While it easily holds 18 pairs of women's shoes, it cannot hold that many d/t the size of men's shoes. Got the clutter off the floor, though. I highly recommend it."
2,Be Careful!,"I bought one of these shoe racks and some of the parts were made out of plastic. My rack lasted about two months before it bagan to fall apart. The stem, shoe holders, bottom and handle were chrome metal, but the spacers between tiers that keep your rack from wobbling were plastic and broke off. I just threw mine in the trash. I wear a women's size 9-1/2 to 10 and could not fit 6 shoes on each tier. I also had problems with the distance between tiers. Some of my shoes hung too low and kept me from adding shoes underneath. This rack may be better made than mine, but you need to check it out."
3,As a space saver it is great,I wish the rings were a bit bigger to give a bit more space between the shoes and make it easier to get the shoes on and off the rack.
4,good enough,Does well unless you have huge feet (unfortunatly thats me) then a little care in which shoes go where is needed. It is a pain to put together.
4,It is a Christmas gift.,The shoe tree is a gift. All I know is that it came in a box with a picture of a shoe tree on it.
3,Not a lot of room for shoes if you have big feet,"Although there are 4 shelves, if you have size 9 or larger shoes, three rack is all that may fit. Also, tennis shoes are bulky. However, it is a nice, sturday product. I am still glad I purchased it."
2,"Love the idea, but not the result","I loved the idea of having all my shoes on a tree that I could spin around, but the end result was messy. It was weird having the soles of my shoes facing outwards. Wherever I put the tree seemed like a dirty place. I replaced the tree with drop-front clear plastic shoe boxes that I love."
4,Good,"The assembly is very easy to adjust. It's not too heavy to carry to one place or another. I like how it has a rotating action to it.I actually have a plastic shopping bag hung around the handlers to put trash in; so I can say it's pretty sturdy. Just don't be too rough with it, it's fragile. Overall, it's a good product."
5,"Functional, practical and looks nice","I have tried many different ways to store my very large array of shoes and this product is the best. It holds many shoes and takes up very little space in my closet. This is actually the second time I have purchased the shoe tree as I decided I needed another one for my other closet. It is very easy to find the shoes I need as the rack revolves and displays all of the shoes nicely. One can adjust the different tiers to accommodate different styles of shoes - pumps, flats, flip flops and varying heights of heels. Easy to keep clean and the base is solid. I have tried other brands [ from Bed, Bath & Beyond] but they were flimsy and the entire tree kept falling over as the base was not solid enough, so buyers beware of these cheap imitations! I definitely recommend this product- get a few!"
5,4 tier shoe tree review wowee zowee,I was a bit skeptical at first. I have had the item for about a month now. It is very sturdy. No problems at all whatsoever. I wish I would have bought two of them. My boyfriend uses it for his shoes too...and he has gigantic feet size 10.5 or 11. Perfect for little kids shoes. Only thing that wouldnt work with it would be boots. Love this product. Highly recommend it. Easy to assemble as well.
4,Shoes fit a bt too snuggly,"Overall, I am pleased with this product. It was easy to assemble and I like that I can spin it to find the right pair of shoes.Cons:1. I think that it is a bit too big, I wold probably get the 3 tier if I re-order again. But that is my fault for not taking this into consideration when I purchased it.2. The prongs/spikes that hold the shoes are just a little bit too close. I wear size 7 (Women's) shoes, and I can comfortably place 4 pair (not 6 pair) per rack. This is because they are a little too close and the shoes become crowded if all the prongs are used. So I actually can only effectively use this for 12 pairs of shoes.But overall, I am happy with this product."
5,Great Space Saver,This shoe tree is amazing. It is really built well and even with 24 pairs of shoes on it - no tipping over!!! I love shoes and this shoe tree makes them all available and in sight. You will be very happy with the selection of this shoe tree!
2,too tall,I purchased the 3 tier and 4 tier to organize the family shoes. the 3 tier is WONDERFUL - works fine - the 4 tier leans to one side and I am afraid of it falling over. - I am going to return it and get another 3 tier.
2,not all it made out to be,"product cheaply constructed vs. price paid. not real sturdy, wobbly especially on carpet. DOES NOT fit 24 pairs of shoes unless you have real small feet. it does fit 4 pair per row for 6ft. size 11 man and same amount for size 9 women"
5,Good solution for small space,This is a great solution for storing a lot of shoes in a small space. Good sturdy construction and easy to put together. It cleaned my shoe closet up big time.
4,Great Organization,Works well and organized great - may have to buy another one since I have tons of shoes
3,Satisfied,"The revolving shoe rack was easy to put together, and works great, although the size of the shoe does matter, if there are just little slide type shoes it moves more easily. The heavier the shoe the harder it seems to want to revolve. It does the job I need it to do. Baskets Should be just a little more sturdier."
5,Great use of vertical Space,"It is nice to have found a 4 tier tree to stack the shoes vertically - I have lots of ladies heels and the spacing seems to be sufficient between the tiers. I don't revolve the rack that much, but when I do, it seems to be very fluid. I have it standing on carpet and it does have enough stability that I am comfortable with - no problem. I think this is a great tree that allows me to keep way too many shoes!"
4,Good to have around,"I have a pretty small room and this shoe tree helps me maximise space.Its weight is a good advantage because I stack more than 24 shoes on it.Great product,cant wait to move into a bigger house so I can buy a bigger one"
3,"Does its job, kinda cheap (flimsy) though...","It serves its purpose. Doesn't take up a lot of space. However, the rack doesn't have that solid, sturdy feel. Looks/feels cheap."
1,Not sturdy,Not sure why people like this product...I cannot get it to not wobble.Maybe it's just me and I didn't put it together well....
5,Great space saver,"I bought this to replace my over the door shoe organizer. I hated those plastic pockets holding dust and dirt, and they were causing some shoes to lose their shape. I put this shoe tree together myself in about 20 minutes. It saves floor space by organizing the shoes vertically, each tier spins, the shoes hang great without being squished inside a pocket, and the whole thing can be moved out of the way if needed. Great shoe storage option!"
5,Perfect,"Not much to say, does exactly what it's supposed to and does it perfectly. Would definitely recommend this!"
3,Well..,"It works I guess. It holds 24 pairs of shoes and all. It did conserve a lot of space in my closet. But no matter what I do, I can't get the tree part to stay screwed into the base, therefore it isn't free standing. It has to be propped up against the wall of my closet to be used at all. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it, but maybe it would be if it were like $15 with free shipping."
4,Misnamed but tasty,"The unhappy reviewer has a point; this ramen is in no way spicy or Szechuan-like. However, it makes a great meal base, or eaten alone provided you spice it up yourself. Plus I can finally eat my favorite food without studiously avoiding the nutritional content label. Way more expensive than typical ramen, but then you pay more to avoid a coronary."
1,Horrible!,"No preservatives, no MSG, also NO flavor, and NO spice! It was like eating plain ramen without any seasoning at all. If you're a vegan and you're looking for vegan snack foods, look somewhere else. This isn't worth the money."
1,Inedible. Really wanted to like it.,"I would rather eat sticks or leaves from my yard. The noodles are awful, the broth is typical ramen broth. I bought a three cases of these because Nissin Choice ramen was discontinued at the supermarket and I wanted something a little more healthy because I eat ramen for breakfast often.I told my four coworkers I was going to throw out all the ramen and they all tried a packet. They all agreed it was the worst ramen they had ever tasted by far and wouldn't take it for free. I think I am going to donate it to the food bank, pity the homeless."
2,this type of shopping will make the more comfortable and ha,we should be very much thankful for providing this type of shopping and making the life still more pleasent then before.
2,its mostly piece of junk,"im usually a fan of sony walkmans,,,this one had the potential for greatness,but the design is sooo flawed, that the clip often comes off, sending the walkman flying and the batteries fly out. often times, when i pull the walkman out of my bag, the battery case has opened, and the batteries are out of the walkman, forcing me to reset my 10 preset stations. might seem trivial, but having had to reset the 10 stations probably 50 times in the few months ive owne the walkman, gets really annoying. good news is--given as many times as the clip has come undone sending the walkman flying--it takes a licking and keeps on ticking"
2,Problem with Belt Clip,"I just purchased the SRF-M75PM and have had the same problem as everyone else with the belt clip coming off. I was jogging and the clip separated and the Walkman hit the pavement!As far as the unit as a radio is is awesome. Especially with the mega bass and pulse monitor.So if you run or jog, don't buy this unit.I called Sony and they have no fix for the problem. This Walkman is going back to the store."
4,Great replacement for SRF-M70,"I own both the SRF-M70 and this new SRF-M75PM. This updated version offers an auto scanning tuner that automatically seeks out the next available station. This is especially useful when your traveling and have no idea what's on the dial. The only problem I've had with this unit is the hatch cover for the batteries, keeps falling off. I ended up taping it in place with some electrical tape. Except for this minor inconvenience, the new radio would have gotten 5 Stars in my rating."
2,Battery Hatch - Button Location,"Yes, I had to tape my battery hatch shut too. Even then the hatch jiggled the batteries, turning it off and restting the time etc. I had high hopes for the design but the grip put my fingers over buttons that I kept accidentally pressing during runs."
2,"Poor reception, flawed design","Had problems with the clip coming unattached from the unit. FM reception is mediocre, although probably on par with most walkman type devices of its class. Perhaps related to my unit in particular, but the socket connection became loose, making it possible to hear through only one channel."
1,The CLip STINKS,"The flimsy belt clip does not work properly. It pops off continuously. My first time using this walkman while on a run, it popped off of my side three times and dropped to the floor. Currently this is worthless for the sports enthusiast."

1,Disappointed,"I received the dishes to find that although they are the same style & design as my collection, they are lighter in color and lighter in weight, slightly smaller dinner plate and manufactured in a different country than my orignal 8 pc set that I purchased locally. I received the dishes with two broken cups and one broken dinner plate. I was truely disappointed, but decided not to return them as I felt I would just receive a similar product. I will ask more questions the next time I order additional pc for my set."
4,Excellent entertainment,"I enjoyed completely all the chapters of this miniseries, it was thrilling. I didn't expect what happens at the end. The performances from all the actors are great. I wasn't desapointed at all. I wanted to watch it before I'll go to the movies to watch the version of this story in Rusell's Crow new movie with the same title. I am very satisfied with the adquisition of this DVD."
5,Intriguing,"Although we struggled with the Manchester accent, this didn't deter us from really, really enjoying the miniseries. The acting was great and the plot moved quickly. We spent a lot of time discussing the events and trying to unravel the whys and wherefores. That's what a good movie is all about. The character Dominic was a bit overdone because he started out as a sort of comical feature of the story but as it moved on he became a pathetic victim. The writers could have improved this aspect of the story. Bill Nighy, however, was fantastic.This is another keeper but to be lent out to friends."
5,Another sterling BBC production,"Let's face it, the BBC puts American TV to absolute shame. While US TV continues to crank out a potpourri of lowest common denominator claptrap, the BBC produces quality, exciting, very well written and acted productions, such as State of Play. It's worth every penny! And while you're at it, check out The State Within too. Another fantastic effort from the BBC."
4,"Really good miniseries, but Amazon let me down","I bought this from Amazon in July. Unfortunately, I only opened it last week to find out it was a defective on the first disk. It played the first and third episodes perfectly but the second episode had 20 minutes of skipping. Amazon has absolutely no way of reporting this after your window of return has expired. So buyer beware. If you are slow to view your DVD's you can be screwed. I have always had good luck with Amazon until now.The series is excellent and quite intriguing until the end. I enjoyed it despite the skipping in the middle."
5,A well done British Whodonit,Very intriguing British mystery. Thoroughly enjoyed it but I must admit I had to use English subtitles since some of the accents were pretty heavy. I recommend it.
5,Great service,"Item was as described or better, arrived very quickly, professionally packed. Recommended. Great UK Mini-series!"
1,Needs to be rated R,"This movie needs be rated R! The language was unbelievably bad and there were lots of passionate bedrooms scenes. Sex was brought up too many times to count. When one of the male characters makes reference to one of his body parts, we turned it off. There is also a gay character. Not sure what other characters say about him because we muted the conversation. My family and I were so disgusted. The story-line was good and interesting. Could have been such a good movie, but with all the other junk, we just couldn't get past it. VERY dissapointed!!!"
5,THIS HAS IT ALL- GREAT PIECE OF WORK!,"Action, suspense, politics, social commentary, great writing, great characters, great acting- there's nothing to dislike here.Any recounting of the plot would spoil the pleasures of watching it all unfold for the first time. And the pleasures hold up on repeated viweings- I've watched this 4 times in the last year.I highly recommend this DVD- and though I've not seen the truncated and Americanized remake, I know it can't compare to the original. So watch this one!"
5,One of the best,"This is simply one of the best shows I have seen, and I have seen quite a few. It is long but I wanted it to be even longer. Top notch stuff here!"
4,Cute but small!,"I purchased this astronaut to use on my son's 1st birthday cake. It turned out to be the perfect addition to the cake. The figure is very small, measuring about 2.75 inches but he actually appears a little smaller. My boys love playing with the figure. Very cute and very sturdy!"
2,Apollo Astronaut,"Trying to teach my students about space travel, and the purposes of wearing a space suit...this was much too small to use in a classroom. The details are nice but no one can see it. Overpriced and not worth it."
5,An Orchestrational Treasure Trove,"Rimsky Korsakov is one of the greatest composers of Western music, but to many, just his orchestration knowledge is enough to study for a lifetime. That is the case with me. Dover scores are simply the best asset to anyone learning composition/orchestration. They may have printing errors or articulation inconsistencies, but that is ok, because you probably won't be using these scores to conduct a real concert program, I would hope. The three pieces provided in this book are masterpieces of comp and orchestration, and have endless learning potential. You have the Bach, Brahms, and Beethoven, now its time to get into the wonderful world of Rimsky Korsakov. Anyone can get something out of this score, and for the affordable price, its the best deal of them all."
5,One of My favorite things,"Live the smell of this perfume, I always get lots of complements when I where it. It's hard to find in the stores and this is a great price and fast shipping."
5,Great very informative,Its exactly written the way the Mr.. Ryder has i his very smal tarot book that came with my tarot cards. Large print and easy to interprit
2,ILLUSTRATED--NOT?,I downloaded the free sample--there were NO illustrations! The text was not long & boring as other reviewers have said; Is the sample a bad representation?
2,Really fragmented.,"I do not have this edition. I got from another publisher. Anyway, I will comment on the content. Really fragmented information. Gives only description of cards. The meaning is still very very vague. Any other tarot book will excel this."
1,"Awkward, Difficult and Arduous","THE PICTORIAL KEY TO THE TAROT: BEING FRAGMENTS OF A SECRET TRADITION UNDER THE VEIL OF DIVINATIONLadies and Gentlemen,This is the MOST DIFFICULT to read book I have ever purchased in my life (and I purchase a LOT of books.) The references the author uses are ambiguous; trying to follow his train of thought and LEARN something is like trying to lift mercury with a fork. There are several GOOD books on the Tarot here on Amazon. Please believe me when I tell you: you'll do better picking ANY ONE of them over this book. In fact; contact me and you can have this copy I purchased FOR FREE ~ and spare yourself an expensive lesson.I hope I don't appear too harsh nor vindictive. I don't write ""Book Reviews"" ~ ever. I only write this one to Spare You."
3,Pictorial Tarot,"To begin I have been reading cards for well over 10 years and was taught by family members with regular playing cards. In relation to the standard Waite/Rider decks the meanings tend to be the same. When I converted to the tarot deck I purchased this book as a primer and tutorial reference. I have to say that if you are a beginner this book should probably not be the first of choice due to the reference-like short meanings for the cards. This is more of a condensed version.I do consult the book once and a while to confirm meanings and for different spread configurations but for the most part, it is and always has been reference only.Thanks, Vandella X"
3,"Great Introduction to The Tarot, for Beginners","A.E. Waite is a well-respected author in the study of The Mysteries. However, this book is not his best work. To be honest, I never could bring myself to do more than read sections of this book. I coul dnever read it straight-through. However, given the system of Tarot, flip-throughs are usually all you need, to discover what you need to know. There are many better books on the the subject of How to Study The Tarot, but this is a good Beginner's lesson. So many people try to make the Study of Tarot a ""cut & dry"" issue (i.e., ""this is the way it is...."")--however, in actuality, it is a life-long process of Study, Experiment, and Collection of Knowledge. It is best to read books by Many authors of Many perspectives and study Jungian Psychology, as well. Consider this book a ""first stepping-stone on the Path of Enlightenment."""
2,Not worth the money...,"While the material discussed is ok, I found it hard to justify the cost of the book. There seemed to be much redundancy in the book as well. It would have been wonderful if the author had finished what he wanted to say in half as many pages. As a seminar leader, instructor, and practitioner, I find it hard to recommend"
3,It works,"The plastic casing was cracked upon arrival. But it does work as advertised. Although I wouldn't suggest using the bun warmer, as all it does is dry them out."
3,Great Grill,"Grill works great for cylindrical meats. Designed for 8 standard hot dogs.....My record is 18. The extras come out just as good as the ""Intended"" ones. Fully Functional Appliance. Quick and Easy to clean.Bun warmer....more like a bun drier. The grill holds 8, YET I have only been able to get 6 buns in the bin. Tong storage and or decor is more appropriate than ""bun warmer"""
3,rollers don't work,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. It is very nice looking, easy to put together, but only one of the rollers works. Does anyone else have this problem?"
1,Don't waste your time or $$$$$,"Took this out of the box, plugged it in, and waited 45 minutes for it to heat up enough to cook hot dogs. After this adventure, I put it back in the box and returned it for a refund. Find another brand, this one is worthless"
3,Not enough room for hotdogs,"I was happy when I received the hot dog roller, however when I went to put hotdogs on it, I realized that only 4 hotdogs would fit not 8 as shown in the photo. Needless to say I was very disappointed, but such is life. It still makes good hotdogs and the above shelf steamer area for buns is great. I guess i shouldn't eat more than 4 hotdogs at once anyways...:)David"
1,Did Not Work,This item is really beautiful. When I recieved it I immediately plugged it in to try it out and it worked great. So I unplugged it and put it back into the box. The day I planned on using it to keep already cooked hot dogs warm and on display for customers at a charity event. Well it never heated up when I took it out of the box the second time. Too late to send it back so oh well I am stuck with it. It is really pretty but that is the extent of the functionality I have found for this product.
1,Doesn't last,Bought this as a Christmas gift in 2011. There are only 2 of us in the house.We have used it only 4 or 5 times. Today I went to use it and it will not heat up. What a waste of money
5,I love this hotdog cooker...,"I bought it for my husband and he loves it. I love it more than him though cause I like beef ball park hotdogs. I used to make my hot dogs grilled over charcole, or if I was lazy, boiled..but not anymore. This thing cooks my hot dogs plump and warms my buns in less that 5-10mins..no pun intended LOL. I recommend buying this if you like hot dogs as much as I do.Oh, not to mention the fact that you can clean this thing in as little as 3-5 mins. The turning grill comes off with a small tug to pull it up and nothing sticks to it. Also there is a tray where the fat falls which comes off much like the buttom of a toaster where the crums fall...you just pull it out and wash it with soup and hot water, dry it up and put it up...easy easy easy, I can't tell you enough how easy this thing really is :)"
4,Hot Dog Roller,I love this product. This is my 2nd one because the gears stripped on the first one. I like it so much I hunted around until I found one I could afford. I'm hoping this one will last longer.
5,"Excellent Amazon Seller, Fast Delivery.and Excellent Product!",My wife and I were very surprised on how quickly we received this product. We love this hot dog grill and us it all the time. It is also very easy to clean. We would highly recomment this seller and this product.
1,Typical - rigth out of the box the electric did not work!!! Guess it was safe electrically....right?,"This product looked good and has a very good idea going. However, my family got me this for Christmas so when football Sunday came around and we had a house full of folks, this little baby that was built in China really showed what it is all about....NO ELECTRICAL POWER right out of the box! Need I say more? What a useless piece of junk, I would NOT reccomend anything from this manufacturer....signed simply as Brenda's husband!"
2,Worth the money! Once you get a working one!,"Got a replacement, and new unit works GREAT! - Amazon won't let me change Stars, but I'd change to 4.5 if I could.!I purchased this after reading the reviews. I had no desire to use this for a party or large gathering, just one serving at a time ( 4-8 dogs). I tried it the day after it arrived and once since. The heating coils turn warm, but they don't warm up enough to prevent touching them after an hour on MAX heat. We tried two batches, after 1 hour the dogs were warm, more than room temp, but thats it. Called the company, they said to return to Amazon, we probably have a defective unit."
2,iz,igot iz and i liked it for a few days. i thought it was cool. then it got boring and i never played with it again. now i am going to get my money back and buy soemthing else
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,THIS TOY IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. IT DOESN'T DANCE AND YOU CANT UINDERSRTAND WHAT IT IS SAYING. DONT WASTE YOUIR MONEY!
1,every since i saw one on tv,every since i have seen on on tv i been scared.it's sounds wierd too.i don't like the music maker.get an idog
1,Horrible customer service!!! Magazine has not arrived after 5 months!!!,"I bought the magazine subscription a WHILE back and has yet to receive an issue. It is very pricey and I thought it would be worth the price, if only I were able to have it! I contacted Amazon which then contacted them and have been told that sometime in late April the first issue of the magazine will arrive...I looked at many posts (sadly afterward) at cake central which had similar complaints. Save your money."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My sister has this single, and she spends all of her time whining about how she wishes she hadn't bought it. I agree completely. Kelly Osbourne is one of the biggest poseurs I've ever seen in my life. She has an awful voice, and the only reason she got into music is because someone - as a joke, probably - told her that she could make it. I did end up listening to the songs, and I nearly killed myself. ""Changes"", which was her only hit, was HORRIBLE. If you want to hear the REAL ""Changes"", buy Black Sabbath's ""Vol. 4"". This was a sad case of a classic destroyed by a new wannabe artist. I can't believe that Ozzy agreed to do a duet with her. Ozzy, how could you? I cringe just thinking about it. If you want real music, buy anything from Black Sabbath, which is the greatest heavy metal band EVER (only the Ozzy years, though), or anything from Ozzy's first two solo albums.Peace everybody, and keep rocking (to good music, though)."
4,Works great until,"The Voice Alert System 6 works great until you have to change the battery. For some reason the system does not realize that the battery has been changed, os it still gives you a warning. But this is a great product."
4,Electronics right out of 1983 but it works,"Soldered circuit boards? In 2011?Per instructions I mounted it high on a garage at 7.5 feet. We have wind right now and no false alerts.So, although I was taken aback by the 20+ year old technology, if it works, it works.So far, it does.The base unit does look like something you found in your mom's basement, though.Expensive, but the cheap ones never worked. I like the voice record, less jarring than an electronic alert."
4,Secure your property,"I have had dogs for over 20 years, and after having to have my last one euthanized, I wanted to have some type of alert to warn me of visitors or intruders as my drive-way is pretty long and obscured from the street. After tweeking the wireless sensor transmitter (ie. false alarms, deer, birds, etc.)I have found that this wireless annunciator is very useful and practical. The instructions are very clear and easy set-up."
1,never worked for me,"I spent almost $400 including extra motion sensors. Was very excited to get it, but as soon as I put a battery in one of the sensors (never even plugged the base in), my house alarm went to trouble. I tried for over a year to get it resolved, but was continually told to try something else (move this, turn on before you reach the house, etc...) I called my house alarm guy and he said the frequency should not be the same, but they conflict for sure. I can't say if this works at all, since I don't have another house to try it out on. Super disappointed. I will say, that when I called, I always got a very nice man who seemed like he was trying to help but never offered a refund or a solution that would work. I bought a cheap unit that didn't work well, then spent a good amount on this and it still didn't work well."
4,Good System,"I've used the Voice Alert System for about a month now. It works good but does false trigger some. I've tried moving the sensor and adjusting the sensivitity and it has helped. I may just need to tweak it a little more. It has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area, which is the important part. I don't know that I would hook it to a siren but I'm very happy with the system. Instructions that come with the unit are very good but where a little unclear about how to hook up the external devices to be trigged. I plan to add a light to be activialed in the warehouse for night. I did buy an extra sensor for the driveway and some of the false alerts there are casued by birds flying in front of the sensor. It's a good 120' away and the base unit is inside a brick building in an interior room (2 walls). It picks up all traffic in the drive. Good system for the money."
1,Voice alert system 6,"I am sorry that I ever bought this thing, it is the most annoying ""toy"" I have ever bought. No matter where I put it or how I adjust it, it goes off all night long. This would be a great gadget in theory if we lived in an animal free (No squirrels) and bug free (no flying beetles, moths & etc.) world but seeing how that is not the case, it's really not good for anyone. Even the shadows of people and cars set this thing off. I thank god that I didn't buy two alert systems as I originally planned."
5,"Expressive, touching, easy-to-read, educational","My 3 year old autistic son learned to say ""I love you"" because these words are repeated on every page with a different noun; for example ""I love you, sun"" then ""I love you, sheep"". It's MY favorite children's book (and now his, too), so he heard me read these words a hundred times. BRAVO! to Ms. Pandell for having the foresight to write such a simple, fascinating, and educational book!"
3,Two In One Year May Be One Too Many,"'Old Dan's Records' was Gordon Lightfoot's eighth album and the first of two released in '72. The only other year this happened was in '68. I think Gordon may have been looking ahead to his follow-up album later in the year (Don Quixote) because 'Old Dan's Records' is a little lacking when you consider that this was written and recorded during the prime of Gordons' career.Containing -10 tracks-, there is nothing that really stands out on this album/CD that would be considered classic Lightfoot, or be included on a 'Best Of' collection. It's enjoyable, but it won't get as much playing time when compared to many of his other albums/CD's."
5,"the real ""Gordon's Gold""","This is Gordon Lightfoot and folk music at its best.If I could only have one of Lighfoot's albums, this would be it."
3,Mediocre and a Bit Boring,"I don't think this is the best of Gordon Lightfoot. I found the songs a bit boring and mediocre. The performance is good, as Gordon always sings well. If you are a big fan (I am not), you might want this one in your collection. If you are new to Lightfoot's music, you might want to start with something else. Still better than a lot of the junk out there, but nothing really special here."
3,Needs a close up pic,The overall picture doesn't quite give you an accurate view. It's made of green PVC and no finishing.
4,Fun with no pieces to lose!,"We bought this and the farm one like it for a long road trip (because we didn't want to have to pick up or lose missing pieces along the way), and my three-year-old loved it. Even better, 12 month old loved it too, and I had expected it to be a little too advanced for him. Now, four months later, it barely looks used and it still gets lots o' loving!"
3,Driving fun,"The puzzle is sturdy and looks nice. However, many of the vehicles get in the way of others and it is just too tight/full of stuff. It would be better if there were 2 or 3 less vehicles and there was more room and some open spots/available roadways.My kids don't complain, but I am pretty sure it would get more use if it were designed with a little more flexibility for play."
2,Hard to slide pieces,"My child has a very hard time sliding the pieces around, and gets very frustrated and just goes straight to another puzzle. My husband and I are able to get the pieces to move, but I can't imagine any child would be able to."
3,was hoping for more,"My 2 year old loves vehicles, especially ambulances and police cars. I thought he would love this puzzle. But, he doesn't. Wish i wouldn't have purchased it, but oh well! It's kind of boring to him."
3,Not Durable; get the Magnetic Hide-and-Seek Board Instead,"My son likes this board puzzle okay, but after just a handful of times playing with it the vehicle ""stickers"" are all peeling off on the edges. He's not purposefully peeling them - he's only 18 months old. It's just not good quality.He has quickly learned from this puzzle the vocabulary for ""ambulance,"" ""police car,"" ""fire engine,"" etc.; he'll point to whatever I ask him about. So the educational value is good. But it drives me nuts to see the stickers all peeling on the edges. I thought the big deal with Melissa & Doug was the quality...If you're looking for something similar, theMelissa & Doug Magnetic Hide and Seek Boardhas held up a lot better for us. It also holds his attention longer. I once got through an entire 3 hour plane ride on just the Hide & Seek board and strategic snacks (he was 15 months)."
4,Great Stripper,"Excellent value for abrading and stripping nonskid fiberglass deck surfaces to prep for painting. Bristles held together for years of abuse and left no rust stains. However, there was a dark gray residue that we cleaned off with solvents or soap and water to ensure good paint adhseion."
2,Buy a used copy instead of the kindle version.,"I borrowed this book in hard-copy form from a friend. The regular book is great. It is written in an easily digestible manner while still covering the material in surprising depth. I found the use of figures and illustrations to summarize concepts particularly well executed. I was incredibly disappointed by the Kindle version I bought for use on my Kindle DX. The text looked like it had been scanned from a copy of a copy made on an old xerox machine. Parts of the letters in the text were missing and the general appearance of the text was blurry. The figures did not line up with the text well, and their quality was not good. I want to make a switch to buying textbooks on the kindle. But if the other book conversions are as poorly executed as this one, then I will stick to buying used hard copies. I would rate the hard copy as a 4 or 5 star book, but I have to give the kindle version a 2 for the lackluster conversion."
4,I enjoyed it.,"In the continuing saga of ex-SEAL Mike Harmon, he gets mixed up in the mid-European sex trade. Serious damage ensues, to the bad guys of course. The places where the action occurs are unusual, and the basic premise is attractive. Who can hate a man who can out-fight and out-bedroom James Bond? Mature readers only."
3,Getting Better,"Choosers Of The Slain is an improvement over Ringo's previous effort in this series, Kildar. He has finished the long set-up needed to establish the characters base and all the additional cast thrown into the previous novel, and can get down to some nitty-gritty action.As he has shown, Ringo has a knack for military fiction. The urban battle scenes are great, and he even manages to pull of the more ""stealthy"" covert sections of the book, keeping the reader interested.The series is still burdened by the Authors incredibly overuse of sex, specifically aggressive fairly deviant sex. This series has such potential that it will never live up to unless the Author steps back from whatever daemons he is working through."
5,Good Read,"I bought an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher. I actually liked this one better than the first one (Ghost) which had a few hackneyed cliches. (co-eds interested in BDSM? Gasp! How shocking! NOT!) This one focused on moving the private, sheltered militia group out and about in the 'modern' world, which was fun. Plus, it addressed human trafficking, which is a good issue (and one in which Might Makes Right ... Just Makes Sense) ;) Remember, This Is Not Science Fiction, exactly. Just a teensy bit of alternative history (in the same vein as the Belisarius series, but not the same time period) along with some men's Action Adventure and perhaps the funniest part, sex scenes written by a man. (Or, at least, from the male's perspective.) All in all, a good read if you're looking for something different from average sci-fi, and you like to vicariously kick butt."
1,Too much sex!,"Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote ""alternative"" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger."
4,"Ok, but not as good as the others","Choosers of the Slain is a decent book and a slightly new departure for the Paladin of Shadows series, as Mike takes to tracking a stolen womam through the western European white slave trade with the aid of a squad of his Keldara retrainers. The core store is sound and like the second book, it is a single story rather then three short stories the way the first book was. As with the other two books in the series, there are some fairly graphic sex scenes - a bit too much for my personal tastes as it happens - and lots of guns, violence, and women. Overall I enjoyed the book a great deal, but I do have to say that it wasn't as good as either the first or second book of the series."
5,4000 new ideas!,"I'm an avid embroiderer, always looking for the perfect design to embellish a cardigan or pillowtop. McCallum's collection offers plenty of ideas and serves as a springboard for some of my own. I imagine this would be an equally essential tool for many other types of hobbyists. This one is nice just to leaf through, too -- it's very well arranged. I'm tempted to order his other books right away, but there's plenty to work with right here."
2,Very approximate drawing,"It's true that there are many different motifs in the book but the drawings are very approximate, without even respecting the symmetry and the geometry of the objects."
3,get them feet together for summer footwear,"i was using this product before ordering from this company, however, if you've had corns for a while it will take a while to totally get rid of them and i found using this product along with liquid corn remover works even better"
1,Do Not Buy,This item did not work and it just irritates your skin. You think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it's the product doing its job but it doesn't work. Not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money.
5,The best thing they've yet done,"I really love this release. Short, yes, but it is very VERY good, the one CD of theirs which I play the most.VERY recommended."
1,"A ripoff, $12 is too much to pay for a single.","Although containing 3 songs, this disc is essentially a single. 'Aquarius' is a less-polished but nearly identical to the album version from 'Music has the Right to Children.' Similarly, 'Olsen' is simply a longer rendition from the album.The only remarkable track is 'Happy Cycling,' which is a really nifty hip-hop-ish mix of the non-existant track 18 from 'Music has the Right to Children.'This disc is worth owning for 'Happy Cycling,' but try to find a cheap second-hand copy instead."
1,"a total rip if you own ""Music has the right to children""","If you already own ""Music has the right to children"" and you are itching for more BoC like I was then just take a deep breath and be content with ""Music.."" becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about. All the songs on it are the same ones, there is no re-mixing at all. But, there is one exception at the end they play a 2 minute bit that gets you excited but then ends. This is hardly worth 12.99 so looks like you and me are gonna have to wait until BoC makes a new album. Awwwwwwwww hurry up guys!"
3,compilation?,"this seems to be compiled from his other 2 albumson blacktop - 'sauce piquante' and 'creole cruiser'it;s good, buti;d get both the other ones, this one leaves too muchgood stuff out..wle."
3,nto the right cd,"look at the name on the cover of the cd ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,it is not e.g.kight .......... it is lynn august ,,,,,,,,,you need to show the right cd in that spot ......."
4,It will blow your mind,"I am amazed how the brain functions are configured to work the way they do. Also, the DVD gives us a clear view of this powerful organ which coordinates the entire body interactions. Moreover, I cannot understand how the big-bang theory, or evolution could attribute the complex design of the brain to random selection, evolution, adaptation or similar views."
3,Acceptable class video,I played this in my undergraduate Physiological Psychology class. It brought to life many of the topics we were covering in class that week. The level of detail was good. The students found the video helpful for understanding topics such as blind sight. I was disappointed in the production value.
4,Brain stories,"Interesting look at the brain and some of the unusual disorders which can occur in it. You can't help but to be drawn in by some of the first-hand stories of reinforced non-recognition of the familiar (""everything here has been replaced by an exact duplicate""), phantom pain from amputated limbs and blind eyes that see. The discussion by Dr. Ramachandran of these cases is absorbing and the computer animation showing what is going on in the brain is very helpful. Well worth watching!"
3,NOVA: Secrets of the Mind,This wasn't exactly what I was expecting. However it's still worth watching. The production lives up to the usual PBS standards of professionalism. It gives some interesting examples of abnormnal psychology. It also gives some good insight to possible causes. However you're not going to learn much about the typical human mind from this DVD.
4,Keeps your interest,"A very interesting look at the human brain. Gives you some interesting theories on how the brain re-routes itself to make good on missing limbs and brain damage due to car accidents. Insightful, but semi-repetitive. Worth seeing though!"
2,disappointing,"Watched this some weeks ago and really can't remember it other than to say it was not what I was looking for. Thought it would give more info about how the mind works, diseases of the mind, basic anatomy and physiology but seems that it only focused on a few stories of people with mind issues. More of a bio on those few featured rather than an overview of the mind itself. Returned this one immediately and again got great service/full refund from Amazon.com, thanks!"
5,Great for HS Anatomy & Physiology,I use this DVD as an intro to brain disorders in my high school anatomy and physiology course. It really drives home the idea that we learn more and more about the brain every day from patients who have suffered brain injuries. Interesting and the perfect length for viewing and discussion. Highly recommended.
4,7 Numbers Each: Desi & Chico,"The Hollywood dinner club scene of the 1940's is well-represented with these recordings (probably done for radio), with seven songs from the Desi Arnaz Orchestra and seven from the Chico Marx Orchestra. A delight to hear! Chico even does one of his famous piano routines on ""Beer Barrel Polka""! Desi was the first to bring the Latin beat (congas) to Hollywood Big Bands -- ahead of his time with ""World Music""! This is a time capsule of the era, the sound, the fun."
4,lucious and latin !,"I actually came across this disc because I enjoy the sound of vibes, and was asking friends for the name of an artist who is known for playing the instrument. I found out that in the jazz world, where vibes are most frequently used, Bobby Hutcherson was the preeminent name. Well recorded vibes are a sinfully rich aural treat, especially on a good sound system, unfortunately the music played on them, which is often modern ""smooth jazz"" is enough to lull you to sleep. That may be OK for background music, but if you want to hear creative and energetic interplay- not to mention Bobby's virtuosity with the instrument, I highly recommend this disc. It was made with I believe cuban musiscians, and is rich with sexy Latin rythmns. The various percussion instruments add a great variety to the sound. This is a disc I would recommend not only for it's musical content, but also for the pure pleasure of the rich sound of the recording. Treat yourself- you won't be disappointed!"
5,AMAZING!!!,I have been fighting dry cracked heels for years.Mine have gotten so bad that they crack open and feel like I'm walking on a nail with every step. I have tried tons of different creams to try to alleviate the painful cracking and this stuff works by far the best of any I have tried in the past. I use it with the Visco-GEL Heel-So-Smooth Heel Sleeves which I got on Amazon too. Together they are awesome!! Don't know if the cream works as well by itself because it works so well with the Visco-Gel sleeves I haven't tried it any other way.
4,Moisture for Dry Skin,"I have cracked,dry skin on the heels of my feet..This cream was soothing,but I have to use it morning and night in order to feel results.If I skip a day ,the skin is dry again.I must use it on a regular basis.."
5,"""Never Mind that the Water Is Poisoned!""","Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (""If you'll just take back what you said...""). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."
4,I can recommend this book.,"Still being many years since this book was written by Henrik Ibsen, the subject covered is very relevant. I loved reading it again after a couple of decades since previous time."
3,An Enemy of the People,Dr. Stockman is portrayed as the protagonist who champions himself as the herioc individual who makes a bleak discovery about the community. He thunders to announce the new discovery against the wishes of his opposition Mayor Peter Stockman. Dr. Stockman is characterized as the man of nobility at the beginning of the play and as the plot begins to unfold the townspeople denounce him as an enemy of the people. Mrs. Stockman's character is portrayed as submissive. Will she patiently await the distruction of her entire family? Will Dr. Stockman sacrifice his personal beliefs for the welfare of his family?
4,A book for thought,"This book is definitely not the most exciting book in the world. Enemy of the People has a specific point, a message it is trying to reveal. Dr. Stockmann loses the support of his entire town after finding out that the local baths are contaminated. Just to make things worse, his brother, Peter, is mayor and actually manipulates the situation to turn the press against him. This play shows how the majority is often wrong and, more importantly, that the strongest man is the one who can stand alone. What made this book lose a star is that, in fact, the first act takes a lot to finish because it appears to be so boring. I may have put this book away if I didn't have to read it. However the book quickly improves and, although it is never exciting, it is interesting."
5,"Brilliant and Original, Period.","I bought this album last fall and loved it, but wanted to wait a while before posting a review. Hsving listened to it countless times since then...I truly believe this is a masterpiece. The previous reviews are right on the money about how imaginatively eclectic the mix of styles is, and Tom Maxwell does a superb job of fitting the various pieces together into a unified musical statement. It's hard to conceive of an album where, for instance, the deep baritone voices of the Remember When soul singers and the playful high cabaret-style female voices sound at home together, but he makes it work here. Taken as a whole, the CD has a richness reminiscent of an extremely good soundtrack album, like a soundtrack to the best David Lynch or Coen Brothers movie never made. I wholeheartedly look forward to Tom's next release."
2,Regurgitating the ghost of the past,"As with his old band, Tom Maxwell proves that he employs style over content in his music. MTV has a way of playing a song to death (the Zippers ""hell""). Then for years to come we must endure the side projects of those one hit wonders. Soon the county fair venues will come calling Tom. This cd is really bad."
3,Not Sony's Best,"I bought this tv when my Sony KP-53XBR300 53"" Projection TV went out after six years(the red ""pot"" went nova) and to fix it was out of the question. As the Sony KP-53V80 had very good reviews I went for it. Bad idea for me as the more I watch it the worse the picture gets. Sharpness was nowhere to be found, the soft colors will not blend, and an all black screen has an area that shows white. The Sony KP-53XBR300 53"" Projection TV was the best I had ever seen. The reviewers for the Sony KP-53V80 said it had the best picture. Not this one. I bought this one for the price and the reviews, I should have paid more and got the Sony KP-53XBR300. Just thought you might want to know."
5,CUTE WEREWOLF SPOOF,"I normally hate horror spoofs, but this movie made me laugh. The suspence is great and the plot does not get off the subject like most spoofs. This movie can be viewed by the whole family (YES, EVEN THE KIDS CAN SEE IT), because there is no nudity or bad language. Buy it today!"
3,It's good but not that good,"this dvd had good quality, but poor sound, when songs played in the background or alot of sounds combined together, it sounded like they were played out of an airplane engine, it had a loud hiss with the music on this dvd. other than that it's good but not that good, basically the sound wasn't remastered for this DVD!"
4,For every family's mouse,"What child has never gone into her parent's candy cupboard and snitched a few bites of a special treat before it was time?This is the story of just such a ""mouse."" For several weeks before Pessach, Sarah managed to ignore the labels on the boxes of special Passover goodies that her mother had labeled just for her benefit--""For Passover. Do Not Touch.""But at last, the sign and the boxes were too much for her, and she took the long skinny box of after-dinner mints, and next broke off a piece of chocolate covered matzoh. She had eaten all but one piece.The seder was very fine that year, but when the time came to open the door to welcome Elijah the prophet, Sarah's father asked the children to search for their Afikomen, they found it, and were rewarded with books. Finally it was time for treats.The last eight pages of this fine 29-page story reveal a secret about Sarah and her family that every Matzoh Mouse needs to hear.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,jjo3's review of dark side of the moog 7,"we were at a local cd/bookstore. i purchased omicron's 'generation and motion of a pulse' and my friend got 'dark side of the moog 7' . earlier that day, we were at a garage sale looking at a jacket. i expressed how much it suc_s when you buy some clothing and know a few days later that you probably arent gonna wear again. she exclaimed it suc_s harder when you buy a cd you dont like. this is what happened when we bought dsotm7. it was very depressing. we felt like we had to give it a cance, but i had to turn off the car stereo and express to her how bad i felt. she felt the same, as did our friend in the back seat. it was a complete drag. especially for teh $ paid."
2,You want gruesome?,"Multiple baby mutilations ruined this book for me. If you're a fan of forensics and don't mind the innocent being victim of psychos, go for it. I was intrigued by the plot, yes, and how she could get it to all hang together, but there were too many cliches: the witness whose call is missed then disappears, etc. Too much, too gory, too unrealistic."
3,"Good, but not surpassing Cornwell...","Death du Jour is undoubtedly a good read, however, it takes a good hundred and odd pages to get involved in the story, before it becomes page turning stuff. Tempe Brennan has no where near the stature or likeability that Dr Kay Scarpetta has...and isn't likely too either."
3,Cult madness,"Forensic anthropologist, Dr.Temperance Brennan is asked by the Catholic Church, to exhume the body of a nun, buried in the precincts of a convent in the 19th century, for the first stages of beatification, in the process of declaring her to be a saint. The weather in Montreal is below freezing point which makes the work difficult and, when the job is done, the news that she must impart to the church authorities is somewhat startling. She is then called upon to work at an horrific arson site where an entire family, including babies, has been butchered and incinerated. The victime were members of a secretive and sinister cult and the story becomes more involved as further bodies are discovered and horrific practices uncovered. It's all a tad gruesome for my taste as I'm getting sick (literally) of reading specific details of forensic investigations and of tv shows of this ilk also."
1,Not impressed!,"The author never addressed what went on (if anything) between Ryan and the sister. I have mixed feelings about Ryan and would have appreciated some clarification.Tempe.....she thinks she omnipotent; she barges in to situations with no regard for her safety or the other people she drags in with her.There is too much unwanted detail(clothes, food, geography etc.)and detracted from the story. I found the ending very boring.I do like Kathy Reichs. I've read a good number of the books in this series and really like some and others (like this one) not at all??"
3,No deja vu here,"Forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan is back in Kathy Reichs's second novel. While working on a special project in Montreal, Dr. Brennan is asked for her help at an arson investigation to try to identify the remains of the deceased. Tempe will see a gruesome scene that is only going to get worse. She will be facing an apocalyptic cult that might have a hold on her sister, Harry.There is not much to say for this novel. The author relies heavily on coincidences as well as plot conveniences to tell the story. Every single body that this doctor investigates in the book will be related to the Montreal arson investigation. The author makes sure that Tempe meets all the principals in the case so that she can solve the crime. If one wanted something this simplified, they would just watch MURDER, SHE WROTE. This book was disappointing after a strong start with DEJA DEAD."
3,Readable but not very memorable,"I found the reading of Reich's first novel, Deja Dead, to be a bit ponderous but all the scenes of Montreal really stuck with me. Still, the slow pacing made me reluctant to read her second book. Now I've read it - and it has almost the opposite problem. I had no problem with inhaling it in an evening. But when it was over I was left feeling unsatisfied.Fundamentally, the flaw in this book is the huge use of coincidence. Everywhere Tempe goes she runs into murder (the Jessica Fletcher syndrome). OK, I can deal with that. But that she happens to stumble onto murders in different countries that are related? That her sister just happens to fall in the circle of the murderers? Just too much for my pragmatic mind...I like Tempe and her supporting cast. I'm just hoping that this is only a case of second novel fails to follow the big debut and that the third novel will be a dandy."
3,"Predictable, Re-cycled Plot & Characters...A Disappointment","This was my first Kathy Reichs book...anyone who was compared to (hopefully early) Patricia Cornwell was worth a try! Plus, the author's occupation of forensic anthropologist had visions of fantastic story lines dancing in my head. Unfortunately, my expectations were never met. Tempe's (female protagonist) family tree and business relationships kept reminding me of those of Kay Scarpetta, and most everything about DEATH DU JOUR felt too familiar. I think Ms. Reichs missed a golden opportunity by spending so little time on the part of her book dealing with the exhumation of Sister Elisabeth Nicolet's remains. The nun's potential sainthood, linked somehow with the present-day cult activities found in the book, would have made for some fascinating plot twists indeed! The author's writing style is good; a little work on more original character interactions and more unpredictable plot lines should make her even better."
1,It's boring!,"I totally agreed with the review of ""Summer Bore!"" and I really almost couldn't finish the book. I think that she had a lot of knowledge and did a lot of research to write this book, but the plot is really slow. There are too much coincidents and some plots just don't connect. What makes it even worse is that the auther tried to connect what seemed so far-fetched plots. After we learned about some cult culture and main characters, the author had to use one sentence as a whole paragraph to explain how the story fitted into her research. At the end of the book, we just got all the expaination of the whole plots and how every character fits in the whole story. I hated this kind of spoon-fed story. I also don't care much about Dr. Tempe Brenna. Too bad for me. I had spent a lot of hours, after putting my two toddlers to sleep, to read a very disappointed book.No comparison to Patricia Cornwell's books."
4,death du jour,I liked it. I'm trying to get all of the collection. These books keep me entertained when im passing time.
3,"An entertaining, ""quick"" read","This 2nd installment in the Temperance Brennan series neither disappointed nor amazed me. There are far fewer terrible similes, ""to say I was cold would be like saying Lady Godiva was undressed,"" but the plot was far too coincidental to be believable. Once again the novel concludes with a Scooby Doo summary, but the crime procedurals are accessible and interesting and the characters likeable. Sometimes. Perhaps that is why I am enjoying Reichs Tempe Brennan series. The lead character is so believably flawed. I am anxious to see what develops between Brennan and Ryan and I can't help but wonder how many novels it will take for Tempe to realize she should at least pack some mace in her bag before she goes wandering off alone in an attempt to assert her self-reliance."
3,Not as Good as Cornwall,"I really enjoy reading Patricia Cornwalls books, and have read them all, so I was looking for something along the same lines. There are a few similarities (job description), but the writing styles are completely different. Cornwall's stories suck you in within the first chapter, and you feel a real affinity with the characters; Cornwall knows how to bring them to life.Reich's characters are flat. You do not feel as if you get to know them very well. They story line is not as exciting as Cornwall's either. with a little more character development and more suspenseful story lines, this author may have promise."
4,Great Book,"I enjoy all of the books I've listened to by Kathy Reichs. I've even accidentally bought 2 of them twic by mistake. If I find any more new ones, they will be on my shopping list."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still very entertaining","This is the second novel in the Temperance Brennan series. Supposedly, because it's winter, work should be slow. Unfortunately for Temperance, it is not. She has a nun to identify and a house of burned bodies in Canada, and mysterious deaths in Charlotte. Not to mention that she has classes to teach, and a somewhat difficult sister to deal with. Still highly entertaining, and I really enjoyed the addition of some sociology elements to the story. A lot of similarities to the first one though and it all seemed to tie up a little too easily for me. All in all however very entertaining and I will definitely continue to read this series."
3,Delightful Descriptions,"Temperance Brennon, forensic anthropologist, very different character from the television series. I am acutually glad that the characters are different, as well as the story.Bodies are turning up everywhere in this girl's life. Slowly connecting the pieces together to a brain washing cult. Brennon finds she may be in deeper than expected when her sister Harry goes missing and her own life is threatened.I loved the descrpitions of actions in this novel. Often things were so well described I felt like I was the main character. The plot unfolded in a way that surprised me but also left me dissapointed. Vague rushed tie ups in the last chapter left me saying ""What?"""
4,A page-turner with ALOT of details on human putrefaction,"I got hooked on the storyline despite the repellant descriptions of decaying bodies and maggots. Kept wondering what the main character, Tempe Brennan, looked like. No description ever given. All the loose ends were tied up at the end, except how Ryan knew about Brennan's mugging. A recommended alternative to Patricia Cromwell's Kay Scarpetta, whose plots and charaterizations are getting weaker and weaker."
2,"Dull, flat writing kills the fun","Gore yes, lots of information about autopsies and assorted other matters, rather too-clearly-fictitious characters ... It all adds up to a rather flat, dispiriting formula effort. If you just HAVE to know who's responsible every time you read of a fictitious killing, then you'll get through this, otherwise it becomes rather a drag."
5,Reichs has a winner here,"As riveting as ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""Cryptonomicon"", Kathleen Reichs' ""Death du Jour"" takes up where Patricia Cornwell left off several books ago. The heiress to Cornwall's abandoned readers, Reichs pulls out all the stops in Death du Jour, weaving an intriguing yarn impossible not to enjoy. I loved it."
2,Abridged,"The info on this audio book, Death du Jour (received from bordeebook), didn't indicate that it is abridged. I didn't like it much, partly due to her poor use of similes, partly because I got tired of the plot development. I didn't listen to the last 45 minutes."
5,it'll cool your warm heart on a summer day...,"just finished ""Death du jour and all i can stay is move over Cornwall, Reichs is here. what a read. read her first book ""Deja Dead, it was great but she is getting better. this is the kind of book to read on a hot day to cool down. can't wait to find out more aboutTempe and her cat, Birdie."
3,"Good, but not as good as the first one","This was a pretty fair book, but I have to agree with a lot of others on this that there were too many coincidences to make it really believable. The characters are good and finely drawn. I really like Tempe Brennan. The forensic information is wonderful. Hopefully, Ms Reichs will have a more believable story line next time. I will definitely read her again."
3,"mildly entertaining, but not the greatest writing","I bought a batch of Kathy Reichs' books for my wife, simply because we both enjoy the Bones TV series. This is the second of the books I've read, and I have to say that if it weren't for the connection with the TV show, I wouldn't bother with these books. They're mildly entertaining, and the science is good, but the writing is not great. These books are not riveting page-turners. I'd term the writing ""rather amateur"".As some other reviewers have brought up, the reliance on improbable coincidences to connect up parts of the story reaches absurd levels. There are other idiosyncrasies of Reich's writing style that others pick apart better than I could. But it's those coincidences that get me.I'll read another book or two, simply because we already have them. Maybe the writing in later books improves just from practice?"
4,not bad,"This book is not bad, but it needs a little more work. She has a good start on her characters, but they need a little more work so that they have more depth or something as they seem a little superficial. Maybe it is because I have read and enjoyed so many of Patricia Cornwell's books and, as they are both about a woman who is in forensics or pathology, I unconsciously compare them and I shouldn't because they are very different heroines.The book is about a woman who splits her time between Canada and North Carolina who examines dead bodies. A lot of the story has been told by the other reviewers so I won't go into too much detail except to say that she looks into the death of a century old woman that nuns want to make into a saint and many mysterious deaths that are extremely gory. It keeps you on your toes and is packed full of murder and hayhem."
4,Another great book,"I really like Reich's style. The fact that she's a real life forensic anthropoligist gives great credence to her work. I've read all 3 of her books and each is just as interesting as the previous.I hope to read more about her undercover friend in future publications. Just like Kay Scarpetta, she needs a social life!"
1,Awful!,"This book was boring and poorly written. The plot was weak and obvious, but worse than that, the writing was simplistic and choppy- very hard to read. I always finish books that I start and this one I almost put down. I only finished it, by skimming because the reading was so choppy, because I had already bought it and couldn't return it. No character development, no characterization of the characters at all, and the dialogue is flat and boring and only serves to advance plot. Descriptions don't describe-they tell in short sentances, or they lecture. I'm a scientist and I found this book boring and annoying!This is my second Reichs novel. The other was better, but I won't be coming back. Save your money and your time!"
3,Disappointed,I got this book for pennies used from the library. I really enjoy the T.V. series bones based on this series of books. This book starts out pretty interesting. The author did have a few of those moments where she over explains things and makes the book drag on as if just filling the pages with words to fill the pages and I had to start carefully skipping several paragraphs to avoid the boredom. Good reading mostly until she seemed to just slap an ending on the reader that just did not seem to fit very well. I agree with the other reveiws stating book starts out good and then drops off and becomes less interesting. This is the first Kathy Reichs book i have read. I think her editor has let her down on this one as he/she should have caught it. But I guess they are just in it for the money ?
4,Death Du Jour,"This book went more in depth with the character of Tempe Brennan. It allowed the reader to see and feel the murders through Tempe's eyes and to understand that she is not a cold, unfeeling character, rather she intensely feels for each of the victims in the crimes she is working on."
2,Bones,"Damn, I purchased the series but can't seem to get into them. Boring character and I was so prepared to love her."
5,I really enjoyed this book,"This is the first mystery novel I've read, an I really enjoyed it. I already got the next book to read."
4,Highly Readable,"I am a forensic mystery junkie. Love Scarpetta and Lincoln Rhymes, never miss CSI, and am fast becoming a fan of forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan. Death du Jour is the second book in this series. The characterization of Tempe is fleshed out a bit more in this book, as we learn more of her personal life. We meet her sister Harry, her daughter Katy is a bit more visible and Tempe looks to have a love interest. But the main draw is the forensics, and we get a lot of it in this book. Flies, pupua, beetles, bones, entrance and exit wounds, etc., etc., it is laid on in almost every chapter. Although the cult storyline is a little far fetched, I read this book in one sitting, longing to have all the connections tied up. Looking forward to the next case, Deadly Decisions."
3,"""Autopsy Procedurals"" have run out of steam","Though I enjoyed ""Death du Jour"" more than Patricia Cornwell's latest (pathetic) effort, I think I've reached saturation point when it comes to reading long descriptions of autopsies... I'm starting to wonder if ""Hannibal""'s pièce de résistance scene isn't a case of Thomas Harris poking fun at Cornwell and Reichs.On a personal note, a friend died in the Solar Temple mass suicide and I found Reichs' treatment (or rather, perhaps, rip-off of that event) painfully superficial.In ""Déjà Dead"", she showed she could write better than Cornwell, while fairly obviously appropriating all Cornwell's ""raw materials"" (just as Cornwell had appropriated all Thomas Harris'), but ""Death du Jour"" looks like Reichs only had one book in her.Time for a new ""genre"" I think."
2,What is your definition of good?,"Readable and missing no pages? Wow! I was in the book business a long time and this paperback I received was not in ""good condition:"" it was dog-eared, had water damage and cover damage. Good thing it was only a paperback and quite cheap. Paperbacks were essentially intended to be like the newspaper, read and discarded. This one, perhaps not discard in this day and age, but definitely not resold. Like I said, good thing a paperback and my ""Author Du Jour,"" because otherwise I would have been p*****. However, it did arrive in record time: 2 days, I think."
1,Yuck,"After the baby mulilations I couldn't read any more. I am still haunted by the images from that, as the mother of three young sons it was too disturbing for me. Definitely will not purchase any more books from this author. I couldn't donate this one to our libary's book sale fast enough!"
2,Death DuJour,"Too much swearing! Books do not need all that to make a good story, it is very distracting"
1,Not the best read,"Let me preface my review by stating that this is my first Kathy Reichs book. It will most likely be my last. I felt as though I was reading a CSI book written by Tom Clancy - way too technical. However, that may be the audience for which she is writing.The first 2/3rds of the book was dull, slow, boring and disconnected. As Ms. Reichs builds to the climatic end, I felt as though it suddenly jumped to 120 mph which did not lend itself the ability for the reader to get a mind picture of what was happening.If you like technical writings (sometimes even in foreign languages), this is the book for you. If you are looking for an entertaining mystery to read, I would suggest you look else where."
5,Death Du Jour,This story started off as all of Kathy Reichs do and as I got further into it the more intriguing it be came and I still could not work out who the Leader was until near the end.Again an excellent novel that I could not put down.
4,"Good, but...","I really liked this book and I love the main character of Tempe Brennan. The characters are well drawn and multi-dimensional and I loved all of the tidbits about forensics and anthropology. The locations were rich in detail and I felt like I was there. My only complaint about this book was that I had every single plot point figured out a good 30-50 pages before Tempe did. There wasn't a single thing in this book that surprised me. But it was still an enjoyable read and even if I knew that going in, I would still read it."
5,"Honest, Attentive Bookseller","The product was actually in better condition than described, arrived before the promised delivery date. I will use this bookseller again."
3,this woman is superhuman!,"I really wanted to like this series and this second one has left me still uncertain as to whether or not I care to continue discovering more about this character. There is just too much going on. I must say, I would rate these higher if the woman, Tempe, was even halfway close to human. The things she does and survives are incredible. I'd have collapsed after page 10. And she jogs. LOL It kind of defies belief that any one person could be involved in so many different things all over the country and actually between TWO countries as well (Canada and USA) and she has more friendly experts and backups that she can call at a moment's notice than any other character!! I don't like when she leaves things hanging through the book, for example about the nun/saint. She knew something on page 20 or so that she could have just stated. Also way too much bug detail, I don't care about forensics THAT MUCH. I'll try one more. Recommended with reservations."
3,I have to say I'm picky,"I'm not a huge fan of Bones, I like Kathy Reichs, and I love the clinical language used in her books. Unfortunately, I get so hung up on the silliest of details. In this entire audiobook the reader actually mispronounces a word and for about 5 minutes I was stuck on that & had to jump back to listen to what I missed. Otherwise, though I'd rather have the time to read them, this & other audiobooks are great for the busy."
4,Will Keep You Up At Night Reading!!,This book will keep you on the edge ok your seat right up until the very last page!!!!
4,A fine read but not as good as Deja Dead,"I was very excited to finally get to read Death Du Jour, and while I wasn't disappointed, I was expecting more. The setting and the crimes were great, wonderfully thought out with great descriptions, but I felt the story lacked the emotional depth that Deja Dead had. But I did read Death du Jour all in one sitting, so that says something about the quality!"
3,so far so good...,"I'm only on page 59 but I'm enjoying this book very much. I like the meticulous step-by-step way Reichs describes how bones are packaged and prepared for transportation. Very interesting.I will, however, be a nit-picky reader and point out that in the paragraph on page 52 about the hockey game on TV that Don Cherry's commentary takes place after the FIRST period, not the second period as Reichs says. Maybe this is something only a Canadian (and hockey fan) would notice but it is quite important for realism. In Montreal, hockey is akin to religion for many people..."
3,LUKE WARM,"COLD BLOODED is a complex, sometimes confusing, and ultimately frustrating mystery film. Director Randy Bradshaw directs in a slow-moving, static manner, and the script is bogged down with so much conspiracy going on, it's hard to focus on exactly who the heroes and villains are.Michael Moriarty is at his soporific worst in his portrayal of the assistant to the attorney general, acting like he'd much rather be at home doing crossword puzzles.Gloria Reuben has little energy in her role as a possible serial killer's lawyer.Patti LuPone needs to stick with musicals; her Barbra Streisand impersonation is fruitless.Kenneth Welsh does a nasty turn as Officer Brodski, who's using a snitch that is possibly a serial killer.The best acting in the cast comes from supporting actors who play the serial killer potential and the cop assisting Brodski. Unfortunately, I can't recall their names and they're conspiculously missing from the box.Plodding and slow, the movie would bear renting more than buying."
2,Poor Absorbency,"V disappointed with these. Way too big to be a size 1, poor fit and poor absorbency. Just finished my pack of Huggies and the difference is clear. Stick to Huggies..."
2,Baby-Dry Diapers Ixnay Asgooday Swaddlers,"Pampers appears to have two lines of diapers for small babies--Baby Dry, and Swaddlers. My wife and I had to buy Baby Dry in a pinch, and they weren't as good.The primary problem is that the waistband is not strechy AND the tabs have more adhesive than hook-and-loop (a.k.a. Velcro(R)). Swaddlers just have the hook-and-loop. You need to adjust the tabs more precisely the first time because there's less forgiveness, and it's not as easy to reposition the tabs securely because the adhesive loses stickiness.Six thumbs down to Baby Dry. Stop those lines, and just make Swaddlers. That's my advice to Pampers.I give ""2 stars"" because the koala is cute, and the diapers are better than going without !!"
4,Sweet Dream Pie,"The book was in good condition even though it was used. It is out of publication, which is the only reason I had to purchase a used library book. The only disappointing thing is that it took so long to come to me. I ordered it on June 9 and it arrived around the first of July, much too long for shipment."
4,This is probably only book you need to read in this subject,"I truly believe that this is the only book you need to read. It has all the concepts, theories about the story. Densly written and every sentence has concept, theory in it. Starts with the history of cosmology and continues with Cosmological Models, Origin of Galaxies, theory of Galaxy formations and star formations and future of the Universe. Inflation and other theories are all covered to the extend that space allows. What I liked most in this book is that it covers everything and you do not need to read ten books to get the idea complete. For more technical oriented person, book has Mathematical section at the end describing the concepts with formulas. Author always gives brief description of concepts and usually he explains any conclusion with reasons so that if you can not derive the conclusion by yourself there is the reason.This book together with Kip Throne's beautiful book on Black Holes will make it complete."
3,Starts Well...,"Very informative book about the broad knowledge base science now has on cosmology. But I felt it was too inconsistent in its appeal. Never really written in a style that I could relate to. It starts off well, but the last few chapters were difficult to finish. That material was not nearly as interesting as the beginning stuff. But he definitely knows a lot about Cosmology. I just can't relate to his style of communicating that knowledge.Try Calibrating the Cosmos for a much better read."
2,More opaque than the Big Bang itself,"I've read quite a few books on astrophysics, cosmology, etc., and this is one of the most poorly written books I've come across. It's too bad, because the writer is trying to be current and thorough. But he doesn't know how to write clearly, his grammar is terrible, he skips steps in his explanations, jumps all over the place, and leaves you wondering ""what in the heck is this guy trying to say??"". Not recommended."
4,A Must Have for Gordon Fans,"I have loved this album ever since I was 12 years old (37 now). It has a very solid classic Gordon Lightfoot style and yet I feel it is showcases some of the best lyrics that Gordon ever put to paper. The album is a bit less rocky than it's predecessor ""Salute"".... It carries a bit more of a folky tone, with a dash of Steel Guitar, played awesomely by Pee Wee Charles...very laid back and smooth. It is a great CD to just sit back and watch the leaves fall from the trees on an autumn day. Gordon fans from Michigan, Ontario, or Quebec will feel right at home with this CD, I recommend track 4 ""On the High Seas"". Salut Mes Amis"
4,"Some great, great songs on this recording!","This album was released in 1980 and was available on vinyl and cassette until CD's took over about ten years later. Since then you simply couldn't get this album! How frustrating! Because it is quite simply a fine Gordon Lightfoot album. I, in fact, had to buy a record player a few years ago just to be able to hear my LP again. I don't understand why Gordon's albums of the early 1980's, this one included, are often written off as somehow inferior. I don't like every song on ""Dream Street Rose"", but the first six songs I like very, very much. ""On The High Seas"", for example, is a song nobody knows, but I am very much moved by the sadness in both the lyrics and musical arrangement. You can probably tell that I am no professional music critic, but I know what I like. Gordon's rich voice and beautiful melodies make this purchase an essential one. Now, if they can only get to work on releasing ""Shadows"" on CD......."
4,A good collection,"I 've always liked this release for the following tracks: Ghosts of Cape Horn and Make Way for The Lady. The others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched The Auctioneer which is so out of place here. If I want to hear that nonsense, I'll go to a cattle auction. Originally a digital recording, it suffered from tape hiss which is odd for digital(the early days of)recording. The hiss is gone but the recording still doesn't sound right to my ears particularly the vocals. Suprisingly, this is a very short disc clocking in at a paltry 33.50. Another entire release could have easiliy fit on the remainder of the disc. I hate when labels cheat the consumer in that fashion. So be it, still worthwhile for some very good tracks. 10 tracks/full lyrics/33.50."
3,What happened with the closed caption subtitles?,"Love this movie. A brilliant film by master Dassin! But this DVD was a gift for a deaf friend! Yeah... I know... I didn't read the cover guidelines. Anyway, I think one of the best things of DVD are the multiple languages or caption subtitles. Image must do something."
3,WATCH IT FOR LANCASTER & CRONYN,"From the violent film noir classics. Tale focuses on convicts pushed to the edge by a militant captain prison guard who later becomes its warden. It's melodramatic at times but it's worth a look for noir fans or anyone who wants to see Lancaster and/or Cronyn in action. Hume Cronyn, by the way, steals some of the scenes (as the captain) from Lancaster (one of the convict leaders who has a wife with cancer). Themes are a bit too preachy, especially at the end, which is a no no these days but back then it was considered okay. DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; THEMES: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2011."
4,Fun but slightly limited,"Previous reviews state false advertising because of the 360 degree movement, and the fact that you cant move into and out of the background. That is a truly ignorant comment because if you would notice that on a flat 2d plane there are 360 degrees. moving in all dimensions would actually be about 129600 degrees (360degrees * 360degrees). Also, while there may not be as many moves as other games, and the combo system is limited, you have to realize the strategy involved in the fighting system. You have to take advantage of other characters' flaws and time your projectiles. You have to lead characters with your projectiles and manage your psi. Limited moves are made up for with the strategic elements. However, some characters are overly cheap (Setsuna) which somewhat detract from the experience. All in all, this is a great game if you take the time to learn more about it."
3,Psychic force is only mediocre,"While pshchic force is entertaining it is severly limited. There is only a small assortment of moves to chose from; guard, strong attack, light attack, and a small number of esp attacks from these. It has some good features, like the fact that the charactors are flying, but the screen is still flat and not 3 dimensional, but since your flying you can go to anyplace in the 2-d arena. Learning the basics, like recharging your psionic energy, and the shiled against psychic attacks are a must, making it difficult to learn. But unlike games like tekken their isn't a large move list. So while the basics are hard to learn, once you do learn them it is easy to master. Where as other more intuitive games like tekken the basics are easy, and you can survive by flailing away on the buttons, learning to master tekken on the other hand takes work for each charactor. So psychic force is good in the3 short term, but the entertainment doesn't last."
5,Canon Camcorder Extra Battery,"I love this, it is the only battery I use with my camcorder. This has helped me out a lot. If you have a canon camcorder and use it a lot, get this battery. It works great."
1,This batteries are completely worthless!!!,"Purchased two of this batteries in September of 2007. They worked fine for a while. Stored them fully charged for about 3 months. When i tried to use them again both batteries had fully discharged, after charging them they each ran for about one minute each and died. Tried to recharge them but they wouldn't hold a charge no matter how many times or how long i put them on the charger. By comparison the original battery from canon only lost about one quarter of its charge in three months and is working the same as new. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, they are unreliable. You wouldn't want to miss videotaping an important event due to battery failure."
1,TERRIBLE!!,"I have never entered a review before, but this book was so bad I had to stop you from wasting your time. I tried to enter a 0 rating but I guess 1star is as low as you can go. The reviews were mixed, but I bought this book anyway because I run a call center and I thought perhaps that would make it more interesting for me. Total waste of time, can't believe that the type A in me wouldn't just let me quit half way through. I kept thinking the ""real"" storyline was yet to be introduced, or maybe some interesting plot twist was coming. Boring characters, unrealistic scenarios. I will never read another book by this author."
2,Bad Writing,"I think this is my first written review for Amazon. I want to save others from wasting time reading this drivel! The writing is terrible, the plot is contrived, and the story is full of stereotypes. Recommend avoiding!"
2,Not so Hotline to Murder!,I thought this was written by an inexperienced mystery writer. Not suspenseful or even very special in writing style. Very humdrum.
1,Had to stop reading,I couldn't get through this. It was so dull. main character was really uninteresting. seemed to be creepily interested in high school girls. couldn't figure out the purpose of the unspecified Hotline... I've put down probably 5 books in my life - I read everything. but this - just couldn't hold me.
5,Love History,Love the way the English language was made readable without destroying the historical content. You really get the idea of what really happened.
4,Book Binding in Opposite Direction of Pages,The book binding is in the opposite direction of the pages!! I'm trying not to let it detract from the content of the book.
2,Characters I Could Care less about...,"This book initially seemed like it would be a great read. It promised black lesbian characters/story set in a different time (the late-50s/early 1960s...I'm not sure why the previous reviewer said early 1900s/1920s Harlem Renaissance). In actuality any lesbian content could be compiled into about 2-3 pages out of the entire book (which was a disappointment for me). Further none of the characters, including the main character Sunshine/Kali, were likable. The author did not make me feel for any of them, except perhaps briefly at the very end.To the author's credit it was well written, though the multiple storylines that did not come together until the end got annoying."
2,Complex image of black life in the early 1900s,"This book is not ""Color Purple"" or ""Harlem Nights"": anybody that is trying to read a simple narrative about black lesbians or the Renaissance will not find it here. Muhanji's characters come from various race, gender, and sexuality backgrounds. This book has twists and turns that may surprise those not up for the challenge of this reading. I didn't particularly love this novel, but I do think Muhanji has talent and will go places one day."
5,Avid Reader,"It is one of my all time favourites. A definate keeper if you love stories about soldiers, Navy Seals etc. An interesting approach to combine the fantasy in written letters with the reality of the characters."
5,It gets more interesting.....,The first episode has Akito beeing rescued on the moon (shades of episode 8) but thats not the coolest part on the tape. The best part is when we actually get to see what the Jovians look like in the second episode. And they are........HUMAN! What the heck is going on? What will he reveal? Is he different from us? AHHHHHHH! I'm confused! ADV HURRY UP AND RELEASE VOL. 8 OF NADESICO!
5,AT LAST!!!!,"Asimov fan for over 30yrs., and never been able to find this book! Not only got it at a GREAT price, but was also in near-new condition! Idle thought to check for it on Amazon turned into a long-time wish fulfillment! THANX!!!"
2,Probably the least interesting Foundation book,"Really, this concluding novel of the Foundation series seems to belittle the original books in the series by trying to tie the Robot Universe with the Foundation.The writing is excellent, and the book is really quite interesting when taken as a stand-alone work... but it wasn't the grand end to the ""Foundation"" series that I had been hoping for."
3,I agree - an ending that leaves something left,"I picked it up to finish the Foundation series; a good ending, I will maintain. It wraps up the idea behind the foundation and settles it to face squarely with WHY things need to be held together, and the justification for arranging things. It does change the tone of the series and is very long-winded and suddenly ended (kinda like...ok...ok...ok...huh?), but it does finally add some closure to the series and a feeling of completion - a reason behind why he even started the Foundation's Edge. For those looking for a thoughtful read and are a fan of the Foundation novels, I recommend; if your looking for more of a fun read, pass this book by."
5,And God created the foundation series.....,"This must be one of the most imaginary and brilliant books ever written. Not only exciting to read, but also an excellent plot, especially for all the fans of the complete works of Asimov."
2,Should of stopped after the first three,"The first three books held my interest the whole way through. Intelligent writing and an exciting story. Foundations Edge was okay. Foundation and Earth, however, was preposterous. I'm afraid to say a LONG, boring story with a rediculous ending. He didn't really want to write these two books and it shows."
2,Too much,"This book has too much of everything... except action.There isn't much of a story and it's way too long.There's a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other Asimov book. Theother Foundation books were fine for all ages. This onehas way too much adult content. I think that 300 pagescould easily have been cut out. In fact, to get to thereal story, just skip to the last 40 pages. Boring.Long. It dishonors the enitre series."
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"Well, 6 months ago I started reading CAVES OF STEEL. I read all 4 robot novels, all 3 Empire novels and all 7 Foundation novels in order. 14 books in 6 months. Some were better than others.As a whole, the Robot series was the best. I found the 3 Empire novels to be the most boring. And the Foundation novels were hit and miss. FOUNDATION AND EARTH is a perfect example of the series; exciting at times and then when you can sense a big climax, it is really, to be quite honest, a let down. I'm glad I read all the books, but I don't think they were really all that well written, Asimov has a curious and cold way of writing. Now onto Lord of the Rings......"
2,Worst of the Series,"If you enjoyed the ending of Foundation's Edge then you will probably like this book. You will find more analogies comparing Gaia to things in the isolate world, and Bliss squaring off with Trevize about stuff you really don't care about. Asimov does, however, succeed in making you feel the fustration that the characters feel when they don't discover ANYTHING about Earth for the first 450 pages. The most annoying character is Fallom. I found myself wanting Trevize to kill Fallom as he suggests he will do several times in the book. The ""twist"" revealed in the last sentence is all but a surprise as Trevize foreshadows it several times in the book. I just read a review that this was more part of the Robot series than the Foundation series. I had only read the first four Foundation novels so perhaps that is why I didn't care for the portion of the book where they meander through space accomplishing nothing."
5,A fitting end for asimov's Foundation series,"This book fulfilled my expectations of a grand finale for the Foundation series. I was captivated by Trevize's journey back to Earth; exploring planets that Asimov had written about in previous novels. The parallels of R. Daneel, Gaia, and God were very imaginative and intriquing. This was one of the more enjoyable Asimov novels to read."
5,Ties Up the Foundation Story Nicely,"My introduction to Isaac Asimov was to read the first 5 Foundation novels. This one seemed to tie up all loose ends (unlike to culmination of Arthur C. Clarke's Rama series). All through the book I was anxious for the return to Earth, to see what really had transpired. Various characters throughout the series had said things like ""why would you want to go there, everyone knows it's radioactive?"" Well I for one refused to believe it. I loved the way that the one behind everything to do with the Foundation was not Hari Seldon as we thought but none other than Daneel. The reasons for all that he did were fascinating.My only regret is that Mr. Asimov decided to work on unnecessary pre-quels to the Foundation story rather than start a new series that takes place after this book. Perhaps some of the brilliant scifi writers that have been successful capturing Mar. Asimov's style in other Foundation and Robot spin-offs, may be able to complete the task."
2,Tried for second time to enjoy this book - still bad,"I read this book several years ago, but didn't write a review. I decided to renew my interest in the Foundation series and since this book was hazy in my memory, I decided to reread it. Now I remember why it's hazy. This has to be the most boring and wordy book Asimov has ever written, period. I found myself skipping over large sections of nonsense dialogue of Bliss arguing with Trevise about Gaia. Nobody talks and discusses as much without saying anything as the characters in this book! I managed to get on by skimming and concentrating on plot points. Asimov in his foreword said his publisher asked him to write a large book and he complied by filing it with 80% useless chatter and boring dialogue. He could have written a good short story about this quest for Earth that would have been enjoyable, rather that this bloated, boring, and frankly turgid effort. I gave it two stars in respect to Asimov, had it been any other author, one or no stars."
3,Yuck. Worst of the Foundation series,"I was disappointed in this book, which is chronologically the last of the Foundation series.The characters act out of character. You have your heroes and your heroine, and in the first half of the book, they're very righteous, debating about morality, and act strongly with conviction. But in the second half of the book, a small event happens and then you get a bunch of whiny wimpy characters. It was really annoying, and if it was anyone but Asimov, a reader would say that he inserted this small event just to build up to another sequel.He could have removed this event and it wouldn't have changed the overall theme of the book. This book just left a bad taste in my mouth -- I was exasperated that our so-called heroes whom we initially rooted for and loved became so stupid."
2,eh,I became enthralled by Issac Asimov through a collection of his short stories. In just a few pages he presented and explored a brain-boggling idea. But in this longer work and two others in the Foundation series (Foundation and Empire and Prelude to Foundation) I admit considerable disappointment. There are some good ideas but they're lost in a sea of shallow characters and needless ramblings. I won't give up on the author because when he hits he really hits. But I'm through with the Foundation series
3,A different style book in the series,"Another good book in the series, Foundation and Earth tells the story from the moment Foundation's Edge left off, detailing Trevize's quest to find the origin of mankind.This book, though enjoyable, was more of a Gulliver's Travels type of format as we hop from world to world meeting variations on human settlement. There is less of the mystery/intertwining plot intrigues I enjoyed in earlier Foundation books."
2,A disappointment,"Nowhere near the intrigue and plot of the original Foundation Trilogy. Foundation & Earth was an irritating series of hypothetical debates that amounted (usually) to nothing, and a series of trite, rather meaningless visits to far off planets. The ending (I won't spoil it) was hard to believe, to put it mildly. I give Asimov credit for some of the greatest sci-fi around, but he should have retired from the game after the 1950's."
1,dispointed,"I was dispointed with the size of the creamer and sugar bowl. I was given another set(like this set) 3 years ago by my daughter for a birthday gift, she got it from the Betty Crocker web site. I was very please with it then as the bowl and creamer was a nice big size. as Betty Crocker no longer carries this line, I was pleased to find the set on Amazon.com. the picture was exactly like the set that I have.However This creamer and bowl that came with this set,looks like it was made for a child's tea set, they are so tiny, neither one holds a halve cup of sugar or creamer. And the Sugar Bowl is oval not round as it was on the online picture. I was very dispointed- as I had planed on giving it as a wedding present to a frend's daughter(who had liked the set each time I used it). I ended up buying something else for her. Now the Butter dish and Gravy Boat are normal size and thats makes them look even more tiny. I'll never buy this again"
3,This is so so,"My husband and I really like the butter dish, sugar bowl and creamer but the gravy bowl is too small and the salt and pepper shakers are huge. I do not like the shakers at all."
1,Cheap crystal set.,"As a previous reviewer stated, the creamer and sugar dish are of a ridiculously small size and are not the same as shown in the picture. One of the salt and pepper shakers was lopsided. The set is made in China and is worth $20 at best. I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift."
4,Ever so Wild,"Two of Frankie Laine's great albums with Johnny Williams are reissued on one disc- to excellent effect! Although the arrangements and style of these 60s albums resemble Laine's and William's work on ""Hell Bent for Leather,"" in this case the songs are not cowboy songs, but, in the case of ""Dueces Wild,"" gambling songs, and, in the case of ""The Call of the Wild,"" klondike-adventure songs. No popular singer has ever explored this rough and ready terrain with Frankie Laine's success, and it's a thrill to hear him charge through such masculine songs as ""Call of the Wild"" and ""Roving Gambler."" Even songs that had proved major hits for other artists are remade in Laine's image: Johnny Horton's ""North to Alaska"" comes to mind. Some may find these selections and arrangements trite and old-fashioned- and they are- but the sheer strength and passion exhibited here is hard to dislike."
2,Another one...,"...of those bands whose latest work disappoints me. If like me, you were expecting more 'sorry about tomorrow' then steer clear. This just wasn't *ahem* 'rocking' enough for my tastes - and felt like a real step backwards (contrary to the other reviews) I don't think they will return to their higher energy material, which for me is a shame, as I was a fan."
4,Puts the gore in goria,"Phantasmagoria is a fun game for anyone who wants to wander a big mansion, find secret tunnels, and figure out why your husband is going insane. You learn some good life lessions in this game, the first being ALWAYS look at the giant house your going to buy BEFORE you buy it. [Trents daughter]"
3,"good, but not great","this is supposed to be a horror game but there are really only a small handful of frightening moments. I haven't played this game in years but i remember it was just ""ok"", and not much more than that."
3,Late in Coming - Graduate Students Read This,"This book was assigned for a required graduate seminar in art history and studio arts. Discussion of the professionalization of the fine art degree through university art education systems results in a glut of MFA artists and terminal MA art history graduates with degrees that do not hold equalavancy to the Ph.D. in the competitive realm of academia. By the time we read this in the final semesters of the degree curriculuum, everyone wanted to change majors but it was too late. Try reading at the BA level before spending thousands of dollars on a graduate degree."
3,"Sometimes scary, but... a little dry.","I got this book (the Bell edition of 1971) in 1975 as a gift, when I was around 9 years old. I was really into ghost stories at the time. What I remembered about it back then was that it was scary, because the stories seemed to be ""true"" rather than made up. True because there were lots of historical details and eyewitness accounts. And true because, well, how could a book that dry not be sincere and true? And thus came the book's downfall. It was like reading Moby Dick, what with lots of facts and detailed names without a lot of cohesive action. Well, at least that's how I remember Moby Dick back in the day. ""50 Great Ghost Stories"" was a challenge to read, but I did stick with it and read it quite a bit.That said, jump forward to 2010, when I picked this book up again. And let me say... my memories were spot-on. It's still a dry read, but the occasional creepy moments are worth it."
4,Practical help.,"This book is great for those of us who may have spent many years bent over a desk, & are looking for practical, easy to follow tips on how to straighten ourselves up, & to alleviate that mild lower back pain from being just a touch out of allignment.The writing style is easy to read & understand, & so are the exercise descriptions. The exercises are also very easy to do (as opposed to some posture books, where the descriptions are hard to follow, & just not practical).My lower back is feeling a lot better thanks to the tips for stretching & standing up straight in this book."
4,Spot on essential,"I teach Key Stage 3 (Grades 6-8), Key Stage 4 (Grade 9) and IGSCE science. I use this book regularly. Most of my students are ESL students and the book is an effective supplement to class texts for its concise topic presentation and its easy to follow graphics."
2,Inessential Atlas,A very succinct book with a large number of good but very small illustrations at a fair price. The book is marred by sloppy labels and poor grammar. I was considering the book for use of a beginning physiology class but it will not be used.
3,good intro only,"I was only interested in about half of the sujects. The most interesting were the Digestive, Repsiratory, Circulatory system. Even through this book is slightly above medicore. If you read this you will know more about the Human body than 98 percent of the population.Book did a great job breaking down the Repiratory and Digestive system.chapters on the muscles and bones was very poor.Still just reading bits and pieces here and there while you watch TV was very helpful.This book is more about 8th grade level. So dont expect a medical school text."
5,Cosmic Goodness!,"I prefer to read the work with all of its crossovers contained, but Infinity Gauntlet completely stands the test of time. Starlin created a masterpiece. he handles all of these characters with aplomb, and you can feel your heart racing as the climax is reached. The only drawback is that George Perez did not draw the entire series."
4,Fun Original Read,"I enjoyed this piece as I'm a Thanos fan. The ending was great, with good reasoning...not one of those ""you're forced to believe it"" endings. I enjoyed the cast of characters, although there wasn't much devlopement shown except within the core characters. If you enjoy anything on the cover, you should really like this book. All in all I loved it."
4,nice book,"The Good: The artwork and paneling is beautiful - George Perez and Ron Lim have done a top job! I esp. liked the sequence where Captain America, Silver Surfer and Warlock attempt to steal the infinity gems from Thanos. The story and dialogs are also nicely done.The Bad: I found the ending a little confusing and anti-climactic but that may be because I am not familiar with characters such as Warlock and Thanos. Also the artwork on some of the fullpage drawings appears very faint - I don't know if this is true for all copies or my bad luck.Overall a good buy."
4,"Great story, with a few minor issues","I've been wanting to read this for some time and I've to say I wasn't dissapointed. I sat down and read this in one shot; to give you an idea how engrossed I was. The story moves really well, they did a great job of juggling huge list of characters and using them appropriately.That being said, it does have it problems. If you are reading this as a standalone, then some of the characters may/may not be familiar. There was a few that I knew by name, but really knew nothing about (Cloak and Adam Warlock are good examples of this). The art is also not my cup of tea either. I grew up reading comics of this era and wasn't a fan of it then - color in what's important and leave the rest b/w. Be as that may, the book itself is as well put together and as well printed as anything coming out now."
5,best graphic novel ever....,"As something of a comic book aficionado, I have to say this has always been and continues to be my favorite comic mini-series of all time. Well written, compelling and engrossing this is a must read. `nuff said!"
3,Starlin Has One Story To Tell,"Although I enjoyed Infinity Gauntlet, I was more than a little disappointed at its similarity to Dreadstorm and the Original Thanos Saga, as well as the subsequent Infinity War. All Starlin Thanos stories have the same characters and mostly doing the same thing. Here, Thanos is still pining for Death, and trying to destroy the Universe and Warlock is back to trying to stop him with the help of the Avengers and other Heroes. The Heroes all get zapped, but Thanos still loses. Most of the characters are completely irrelevant to the story and are just plot devices to be knocked down by Thanos. It's really really derivative of the earlier stuff. Worse, Thanos seems like a pathetic wuss when he is trying to impress Death, it seems to me that this relationship worked better in the original saga, but I may be remembering it better than it was. This story really did not hold up."
3,Meh,"Was hoping for more based on the reviews, but there are too many plot holes and assumptions. It was a good story that could have been told better."
3,More hype than video,"This video was very hyped, because of the 40th aniversery playmate, but compared to other playboy videos, it lacked in content."
3,It is okay,"Playboy / Anna-Marie Goddard is fifty minutes long and was released on video on February 23, 1994. In my opinion, Anna-Marie is of the few Playmates that look sexy wearing clothes or no clothes. Anna-Marie Goddard is Playboy's Playmate of the Month for January 1994 and 40th Anniversary Playmate. Anna is seen in the first twenty-nine minutes and is only nude about 15% of the time. She left me wanting more. The other seventeen minutes are dedicated to the Runners-Up Bonus and the Anniversary Playmate search. Two future Playmates are introduced: first is Julie Lynn Cialini. Julie was Playboy's Playmate of the Month in February 1994 and Playmate of the Year in 1995. The second Playmate is Traci Adell; Playmate of the Month for July 1994. I saw more nudity with Traci and Julie combine then I did of Anna. Playboy / Anna-Marie Goddard get a C."
1,"a patchwork, not a book","The authors have taken the opportunity to publish a book of which they wrote only a small portion. The plot progresses through the snippets of first-time writers. This book is not a part of the series but an attempt to milk the series for all it's worth. (See also Grantville Gazette I,II, III).Instead of a cogent style, the book is pieced together from snippets available elsewhere. As a result the book fails to tell a cogent story, forcing the reader to parse disparate language and editorial differences from section to section."
1,1634: The Ram Rebellion,"Very, very disappointing. I loved 1632, liked 1633, was luke warm over the Gallileo book, and really disliked this one. Sad to see a great idea/series start go downhill so fast. The ""humor"" in this book is mildly ammusing for the first 10 pages or so then increasing sophmoric and boring for the next 50 pages. I scanned the last 50 pages and then ash canned this turkey. Save your money. I hope ""CAnnon Law"" returns to the quality of the first book, but the blurb on it is not promising. Most readers, like me, don't really care how many angels can dance on the head of a 17th century pin and get really bored with endless minutia about religious arguments. Wake up Eric and give us some fun, rousing tales of survival, war, and innovation in the unique ""world"" you created in 1632."
1,don't buy this book......,"....unless you have nothing else to spend your money on. I am a great fan of the other books, especially 1633, but this one is a poorly, maybe even unethically, conceived project. Many of the ""stories"" contained in the book were written by non-professional writers, and it really shows. Apparently many of them are available on the web, which makes the decision to publish them in book form, without warning the purchaser, rather iffy, in my opinion. The theme that is supposed to hold everything together, ""Brillo"" and his use as a symbol for a new form of government, is just, well, lame. The songs are unbelievably tedious, and the idea is not ever presented coherently.Pass on this one, save your money for 1634: The Baltic War."
1,What A Mess!,"This side story is actually an anthology of semi related tales. It is tedious, boring and an absolute mess. Unless you have a passion for the minutiea of 17th century German government this is a waste of time. I have enjoyed the other books very much but this one is so disjointed that it barely makes sense.I would suggest skipping this one and waiting for the ""real"" book to come about the Baltic War."
2,Boring and pointless,"I found it difficult to read through, goes into heavy detail on 17th Century German farming culture early on and that was the exciting part."
2,Bewildering Mish-mash,"Eric Flint calls this an ""oddball volume"" and a ""cross between a traditional anthology and a novel"" in the preface. I found it a bewildering mishmash, even the wrap up section at the end. The storyline jumps between characters and locations frequently, and the timeline jumps back and forth as well. The number of characters in play is astounding, and most of them are not the main 1632 characters. It was just plain hard to follow, and therefore hard to fully enjoy. For newbies, this is a definite DO NOT BUY. If you are a 1632 series experienced reader, go ahead, but be forewarned that this one falls a little short."
5,The complexity of alternative history,"For many readers of the Honorverse expecting lots of swashbuckling combat, the Ram Rebellion will NOT be their cup of tea. But if you enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of an alternative history and finding out what is REALLY happening behind the scenes and in odd, but crucial places, then the Ram Rebellion will keep you turning the pages. As Eric Flint himself has said, real history is messy. And 17th century Germany has tons of complications to make the 163x universe very messy indeed."
2,Disappointed,"I love the 1632 series. I have bought every book as soon as the come out, and enjoyed each immensely. This is not a novel in the normal definition. It is a collection of stories, kind of like the Gazette, except the Gazette is interesting. I was bored frankly with the stories. I normally read a book in less than a day, but this one took me over 4 days, because i just could not get interested, I just finished it to keep me in the story and to ensure I would not miss anything for future books."
3,"Not bad, but not fullfilling.","I liked this book as a series of related short stories. I liked how it provieds some additional background about what's going on in this new time line. It was nice to see how things are chaning in the area around Grantville. I emjoyed reading this, even though most of the writers aren't at the same level as Flint. However, I think the next book in the series from Flint is long over do."
2,Slow and Confusing,"To me, the best recommendation for a book is how often I re-read it after I have read it the first time. For example, most of my copies of Robert Heinlein's books and early Tom Clancy novels are almost worn out. By that note, this book gets low marks, unlike other books in this series. It is slow and confusing. Fans of the series probably should read this book as it does contain information important to other books in the series, but these are characters and stories you will soon forget. I have."
2,Wish they'd remember they're spinning a yarn!,"Sorry about the terrible pun in the review title, given the subject matter of this book. But the book is a death march--a long slog through trivia that might be fascinating to a few Baen's Bar fanatics, but which the rest of us find pretty boring. The greatest thing about 1632 was the fact that it told a great story, which was strong enough to hold the history that was hung all over it. The storytelling isn't nearly as strong here, and the history weighs it down. Recommended for die-hard 1632 fans only."
3,Not as good as I hoped!,The early in this book are fun and enjoyable reads. The later stories I found slower with the exception of the final climax of the book. This scene builds up through several of the stories to the final event and it suddenly occurs and is done with. There is less explanation of these final events than I found to be satisfactory. But it is in a series that I really like so it was still enjoyable. For those who do not like the deep intrigue of politics this may not be a favorite after the first couple of stories.
1,Ponderous and Uneven,"I need to start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed 1632 and 1633 and am an avid fan of alternate history novels. That said, wow, this book has been some serious work to get through. With a cast of over 50 characters (many who go by several names) and multiple stories cobbled together, this book is all over the place. I tend to read in small sessions and this book is not conducive to that at all. This book is only for the die hard fans of the series, and then only for those who like stories about tedious political maneuvering.This counts as strike two against the entire series, with 1643: The Galileo Affair being the first. Mr. Flint needs to get this series back on track and stop focusing on these side stories. The main story line is solid and makes for great novels. Save these side stories for the short story compilations where they belong. I will try 1634: The Baltic War next, but if it is strike three, then I'm done with the series."
1,Worst in the series thus far.,"By far this is the worst book in the series. Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development, 200 pages of dry political education, and 100 pages on ballet recitals. Dry and pointless reading."
1,Hugely Disappointing,"I've read all the previous entries in the Grantville Universe and enjoyed most of them quite a bit. But where the use of various writers and short stories worked well for a time, the quality of the writing has been steadily decreasing.The Ram Rebellion reads as a book totally abandoned by Eric Flint and handled almost entirely by the Regulars at Baen's Bar. I understand Baen's practice of pairing up-and-coming writers with more established writers in order to develop new talent and further the plot of popular series. It's worked well in the past.Here it simply failed. I'm about 1/5 through the book and am so tired of the lackluster writing, the sophomoric humor and the terribly slow plot progression that I'm putting it away for good. I'm probably unlikely to read the rest of the series because it's reached a point where having Flint's name on the cover is totally meaningless and not at all representative of the quality of writing to be expected within."
3,1634: The Ram Rebellion,"A good sidebar to the ""1632"" series of books. Not as exciting, nor engrossing, but fleshes out new characters in the continuing story of those Americans who were caught within The Ring of Fire. Look forward to new releases in this series. I've read four so far."
3,OK - But Enough Already,"I am one of those rare birds who actually enjoyed 1634: The Galileo Affair. I thought this would be an interesting sequel of that type. When I first started reading, I was very upset that it appeared to be a mish mash collection and it certainly was an up and down read. The final part of the book finally took off and ended up being an above average read, but come on already! Eric, GET OFF THE COUCH, STOP making excuses for your partners and WRITE THE REAL 1634 SEQUEL! THE REAL FAN REBELLION IS COMING AS WE ARE TIRED OF BEING TEASED! Write it yourself if Drake is too busy. So much for the joys of collaboration. We want the real thing, not more delay!"
2,Disappointing After the Really Great Work in 1632 and 1633,"I discovered Eric Flint's work when a friend loaned me 1632. I had not read much speculative fiction other than some Harry Turtledove and I have to say I loved it. Then I went out and bought 1633, it was another gem. Things skipped a bit with The Galileo Affair, just a little too much sermonizing. But this latest, The Ram Rebellion, just stinks. Most of the stories were written by obvious amateurs fascinated with sheep, cooking, agriculture and whatnot. Now those are all fine things, but I bought the other books to be entertained with action+fantasy+history, in that order, not history+agribusiness+feminism. I am going to read one more book in this series and if it does not improve I will swear it off for good."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I loved the first two books in this series but this one is a waste of time. Stories about sheep farming and ballet, are you kidding me? Call me when Mr. Flint gets back to the struggle of surviving in the brutal 17th century."
1,The reviews are more interesting than the book,"I must say that several of the reviewers that gave this book fours and fives showed a livelier imagination and greater writing ability than did the people that contributed to this book. If you've been reading the reviews, and counted the stars, the ones have it. There's little to add that hasn't been said already. I simply wanted to add my two cents in the hope that I might save one person eight hundred or so cents.This book is not an enjoyable read. Say what you will about the aims Eric had for this book... I buy books to read for enjoyment. This one I finished only because I spent money on it and I hate throwing away a book without reading it once. It was a relief to hit the last page."
3,JUST OK,"Just OK, not fantastic. Despite the reviews, no, it would NOT fool anyone. It's simply a nice addition to add to a collection of fun jewelery pieces."
5,I use this daily and it's great!,"I don't really like wearing my wedding/engagement rings on a daily basis. I'm always doing something with my hands, at the gym etc that the rings make me feel uncomfortable and I needlessly worry about whether the diamonds would drop off or I'd lose them.I bought this ring off Amazon.com as it was a cheap version of what my wedding band looked like. I have used this for the past 1 year and trust me, it's been through a lot. It still looks great! It's comfortable, no maintenance, low stress, negligible investment and it looks great. No one knows it's not my real wedding band!It really does serve my purpose. I would recommend this ring to anyone who would like something affordable for everyday use but doesn't come off like it came out of a 3rd grader's jewelry box. Quality product."
4,Very pretty,This is a really pretty ring for a nice price.It shines a lot and seems to be very well made.The only think I don't like on it is that it says MADE IN CHINA in the inside.I would be a little ashamed if I would buy this ring for a gift.
5,Just as described - maybe better!,"I am very happy with this purchase. It is just as described - maybe better. It is a very comfortable ring, has just the right amount of sparkle, looks just like the picture, and saves me having to get my real wedding band sized for now as this one looks almost as good! Thanks!"
4,Fabulous,"This little ring is worn regularly and has fared well. No stones have fallen out, it's kept it's sparkle with little cleaning and my mom's friend, who is a jeweler, commented on how well made this ring is when taking a quick look at it. I write this review about a year (or more) after having bought this item, so highly recommend it.The only thing that prevented me buying another one and from giving it 5 stars is that I am very put off by the stamp inside the ring that reads ... Made In China! ..."
2,CZ ring,"This wasn't expensive, but it is rather cheap looking. I have seen better CZ rings like this, at about the same price."
3,Worked well.,I bought this ring to wear to work during my pregnancy because my gold ring did not fit anymore. It worked great as a replacement and kept it's shine for months. Definitely worth it.
2,"it nice, but meh","its nice the first few times you wear it, but it quickly look dingy, even after being careful not to get it too worn out."
2,"Very pretty, not durable","I rrceived my ring very quickly in the mail. Because it was on sale, I felt I'd gotten a great deal! Especially once I put it on my finger. Its a beautiful ring! But in less than a week, one of the stones is already gone. What a disappointment."
4,Pretty and somewhat good quality,"I loved this ring when I first got it. It gives off a great look, but now it seems a bit faded away/washed out."
3,it's a 20 dollar ring...,"what can you expect? This ring did live up to it's price, I was just hoping to get more than I payed for. Lightweight, no sparkle, cloudy stones...it went back immediately."
3,Not convincing.,"I was excited to order this ring. I have developed an allergy to my white gold wedding set and needed something sterling silver to wear. The price is certainly right on this ring, but it isn't really convincing enough to pass as the real deal. I had decided to keep it since it was okay for the price, but I ordered the wrong size and sent it back anyway."
1,Not so much,I was very disappointed with this ring. I plan on returning it. Looks nothing like the picture. I would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall. Totally over priced not worth it at all.
4,Beautiful ring and a great alternative to the real thing,"I have a gemological certification and have spent a number of years in the high end jewelry industry. I was looking for an eternity band to wear while traveling, afraid to wear my own diamond eternity band abroad. This affordable sterling and cubic zirconia eternity band is far more realistic and beautiful, than I had anticipated. If you're looking for an affordable eternity band, whether it is to replace your own for travel/security reasons, or if you are looking for an eternity band unable to afford real diamonds set in white gold or platinum, for yourself or the one you love, then this ring is perfect.In addition, the ring arrived with a beautiful ring box, as nice as any ring box I've ever seen working in the high end jewlery industry, making it perfect for gift giving."
4,Decent,"After having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger, I decided on this one. This is the 4th ring I've tried. It fits nicely and looks fine with my small diamond solitaire. Has a good amount of sparkle but definitely doesn't look expensive. Don't let anyone look too closely!"
1,disappointed!,I wore it once and a stone has already fallen out. Spent way too much money for that to be acceptable.
5,Love this ring,"I like this ring. Inexpensive, but doesn't look it. Delivery was prompt. I probably should've gotten a slightly smaller size, but that's okay. Fits in with all my other shinies."
2,this thing is huge,"unless you have massive hands, this thing is too big. as soon as i got it out of the box i put it in my hand and back into the box and returned it. spend the extra money and get a dreamcast controller. nyko has another controller that it has but amazon no longer carries. that one is good (purple)."
4,good movie about moonshiners,We like movies about moonshinning and bad guys and then there's comedy like the dog and romance. then this all happens with all the water.
3,My son (age 16) is a wrestler,"My son is on the wrestling team. Since joining the team we have been at constant battle with ringworm and staph infections, so called 'grappling' illnesses. Anyway, after doing some research we decided to try this product. Funga Soap is packaged well and the price is reasonable, after receiving it and looking at the ingredients I was impressed. It being a new product, I tried it on myself first. I had no adverse reactions to this product however,my son broke out and his skin itched badly. Also the smell of the product is really bad. In conclusion, I think this product would probably work fine if your skin can handle it. But the only way to know if your skin can handle it is to buy it. Because we had such mixed results, I don't know if my review is helpful."
3,It helps...,"we suspected my husband has athletes foot. It showed up after he got a pair of shoes from a second hand store and he's had it for years. This product helps a lot, but it's still there. Maybe there are different levels of athletes foot and my husbands was just too far for this product. It did relieve itch, dryness, pain and swelling so I would say it was worth it."
2,NO use!!!,"It feels good after washing with it, but it has no effect on my fungi-nail at all!!! But it do feels good using it to wash."
4,Works!,Feet smell goes away fast after wearing tennis shoes or hiking boots for long days. Gets rid of itching and sensitive spots from shoe rubbing are not bothered by the soap. Strong smell- not really good or bad to me.
4,Mmmm.. Nice... Funga Soap,"I purchased this product because I was going camping and spending time at the beach. Knowing that things live in the woods and sand that are very fungal and like human skin I figured I would be on the proactive side of the attack this time. It has been wonderful. I knew it had tee tree oil in it but was pleasantly surprised with the Coconut, Olive and Peppermint oils. This product attacked a fungus I did not even know I had but can guess I got it from the local pool too. I now use it after every time I am in public spaces, especially the watery kind."
4,Feels good and smells great,"This product was not as ""tingly"" as some others, but did provide solid anti-fungal protection while I was traveling. I think that the product does what it says, but it's hard to truly quantify it since I was using it in conjunction with other products."
4,Works well,Worked well on itch. Its certainly no miracle cure. Like other reviews say you have to use it everyday. I will probably buy this again.
3,feels clean,I got this product because I have dry skin on my feet and I was hoping to remedy that situation. The product makes my feet feel really clean but hasn't helped with the dry skin.
1,No help,This product did nothing. You are better off with regular soap and just drying off well. Use a hair dryer if you must.
2,Had a bad reaction to this soap,"This soap made me break out in a rash everywhere I used it. I do not have insurance and I thought I would try to get around going to the dermatologist, but in the end it cost me more because I had to go to the doctor for the rash this soap caused and the original problem. It was $96 for an office visit(the dr. actually gave me a discount believe it or not) and I got 3 different kinds of meds that cost me $76 total. Just be careful if you use this stuff. Not sure what I had the reaction to because there's alot of stuff in it."
3,It is alright.,It smells nice. Didn't do much at all for the fungus - 1 star on that count. It got three because it smells nice and didn't make the fungus worse.
5,great product,I recommend this product to whomever like to feel the cleanness and freshness on your feet. I am a very active person and I tried many products but nothing like this one. 100% recommended
5,Smells like awesome!,"This stuff is great! Not only does it smell good, it feels great and lathers up nicely.Oh and it is doing wonders for my feet, which have a history of being dry n flaky and not super awesome to look at.With any luck, and the continued use of this, my feetsies shall once again see the public light of day!"
4,Not a perfect cure but it definitely helps.,"My boyfriend had suffered from terrible athlete's foot for years when I met him. I've made it a mission to help cure it. He said he's been to doctors numerous times and it never improves. His feet are red, cracked, peeling and insanely itchy. The shower always hurts his feet and makes them itch more.After buying a few products from the store (lotions, etc) and not showing any improvement I started looking online which led me to this stuff. The product smells a little funky (the whole bathroom will smell like it after he uses it) but it has really helped. He's nowhere near cured but the cracking has stopped (his skin hasn't split in awhile), the redness has gone down and they don't itch near as much. We're pleased with the results.More recently we've also started bleaching his feet which sounds crazy but does help!"
3,PediFic FungaSoap,"Smells decent and leaves me feeling clean, but didn't really fix what I bought it for (toenail fungus), would recommend anyway as a foot soap"
1,Didn't work,"Don't waste your money.I tried this for my ringworm. Did not work at all. It could have actually made it worse.Pros:None.Cons:a)This product will dry your skinb)You may break out if you're allergic to any of the ingredients, which may have happened to mec)It burns and stings for a quite a while after applicationd)It is watery and comes out faste)It is expensive for what you getI'd suggest an ant-fungal topical ointment before this. Don't be fooled by the great and perfect reviews. It is not great at all."
4,Good,"I think it's working, my skin feels way better when I shower with this. It seems to help with athletes foot."
5,Squeaky clean toes,Feet feel refreshed and moisturized. Cleaner feeling than soap. Toe fungus has dramatically improved. I would highly recommend this product to anyone for extremely clean feet.
2,"May work for others, but did not seem effective for me.","I don't like it simply because didn't help with my issue with tinea, not even a little. Was hoping it would of made some sort of difference, but after 3 months of using this, it didn't help with my issue."
4,"Smells funny, but works great!","I bought this product for my granddaughter to try on her eczema. It helped with her itching. I also tried as a body wash. As a women going through menopause, there are places you tend to sweat wear you never sweated before. I was noticing an unpleasant odor and tried different things to help get rid of that. This product smells funny, but it rinses off. I no longer have the odor."
4,Strong Vapor Action,Didn't cure my athlete's foot like others claimed but it does seem to clean deeper than regular soap. A worthwhile investment.
1,Disappointed,I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed. This product had GREAT reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots. Unfortunately it did nothing for me.
5,good product,"It's a good product and I don't regret buying it. I think it had a beneficial result on my son's skin. It indeed smells with specific odor, but this is not a problem for us.Thanks!"
2,"Feels nice, smells nice, but didn't work for me","I ordered this attempting to replace a clomitrazole and betamethasone diproportionate cream I use by prescription for a rash on my leg. While enjoyable to use, it was ineffective at preventing my rash.Following this, I triedClotrimazole Anti Fungal Creamand have seen good results. It seems the betamethasone isn't necessary to keep my rash under control."
3,condition still exists,have been using this product faithfully for at least weeks and the condition still exists.
2,"Great Product, but Inaccurate Size Info","This is a great product that works exactly as advertised. My issue here is with the seller. They list the item as 11.2 oz., but the actual size is just 6 oz. You can get this cheaper from other vendors on Amazon."
4,to pricey for me,"its a nice product. leaves you feeling clean and fresh , but the price is a bit outrages for the amount you get. (over a dollar an oz). i might pay 7 or 8 bucks for 13 ounces but 15 ? no thanks. 30 dollars every month or so for soap doesn't fit my budget. i gave it 4 stars for the product alone , but it certainly isn't a good deal."
1,Foot Splash,"It is not antifungal. For a new, fresh, clean scentto feet, eh maybe try massage oil or a scented moisturizing powderrather than this product."
3,Still waiting,"I have embarrassing toe fungus on one of my toes, and have had it for years, and tried what seems like every otc fungus treatment you can buy, and nothing has worked. I figured I would give this a shot, and I have had it for probably about a month or more, and have used it almost everyday, sometimes i forget to use it. Well I'm still waiting for the results. I have seen a little bit of clear up, but not a whole lot like some of the reviews have experienced. I have seen faster results with using vick's vapor rub on my toe, but I'm not going to give up I'm going to keep using it, I bought it, I'm not going to waste it, if I see anymore clear up, I will post it."
5,FUNGUS REMOVER,"I use this on my feet every time I shower. This really does work. If you are skeptical at first I suggest you buy the 6oz bottle. Once you see that it works, buy the 13.5oz bottle. This is a good purchase if you are embarrassed of showing your feet to people."
4,"I bought it, but my daughter loved it!",I bought it but my daughter loved it so much it disappeared. She said it made her acne much better!We also loved the scent.
2,just a nice soap,"This is a nice soap, nice smell. But it had absolutely no effect on toenail fungus and foot itching. I really do not understand where all the extremely positive reviews come from..."
5,Good Shampoo you can't find in most pharmacies,"If you get past the smell, this is a great shampoo to get rid of fungal skin problems in your hair. The smell is quite strong, but it seems to really help, so that is what is important."
2,disappointed! little treatment,"I have to say this one has little treatment for my Tinea Versicolor on stomach. I have used two bottles for 6 months, but it just very slightly goes better. I also used other tree oils, but still no effect. maybe it's because mine is a little bit severe since it's already there for like 4 yeas before I decided to treat it. But it's no excuse. it's should be used to treat this kind of gray skin. I'm disappointed."
4,worked but for something other than what I bought it for,"My husband has developed a case of Tinea Versicolor in the last couple of years. Last fall, it got really bad, it was all over his chest and shoulders and was spreading up his neck. I found this product on Amazon and read a ton of reviews. I thought this would help him, or at the very least not make it worse. Unfortunately, it didn't have any affect on my husband, but... in one of the reviews someone commented that their daughter took their bottle because it worked on their acne. I have adult onset cystic acne and it had exploded on my face recently, so I thought, ""Why not"" so I tried a little on my face and thank goodness. It helped calm my face way back down. It didn't happen overnight, but consistent use with my regular regiment really got it under control. So at least this product worked for one of us."
4,Finally!,"I like this product, it works pretty well for Tinea Versicolor, just give it time. After a week of treatment, my skin was already returning to normal, which is good, cause I don't have the time or money to see a doctor."
3,Not sure if it worked or not,"The rash I bought this soap for is going away but I'm not sure if Fungasoap was responsible. My athletes foot went away but I was treating it with something else, so... who knows?This soap has a very strong odor but it doesn't linger long on the skin and does not transfer to clothes or bedding. It rinses off well and leaves you feeling clean.Try it, it may help."
2,Letdown,"When i first heard of the possibility of a star blazers dvd i was quite excited.Unfortunately once i received it,i was throughly disappointed.Even though the original program was quite old,voyager could have done a much better job here.They cut corners to save money.Even some of the poorest vcd's have better video and sound quality than this dvd edition.You would do yourself much better to buy the current video tapes that are out there.As long as you have a halfway decent vcr,you'll do much better than this dvd edition.Keep your eye out for the japanese edition dvd's.I'm sure they are coming,if they aren't out already.They won't cut corners at the expense of quality.Save your money and spend it on some other anime dvd's like sol bianca.(Don't waste your money on the funimation dragonball z dvds,or the evangelion dvd's either.Their quality is almost bad as this)"
4,This is better than VHS.,"About 15 years ago, I found an article in a comic book advertising Star Blazers on video. I was excited at the prospect of watching my favorite animated series all over again. However, when I got the tapes I found the picture was very dark. I had to adjust the bright and contrast on the tv and even then it was not a perfect picture(my videos were made by Kidmark, INC.). While this occured on the entire ""Quest for Iscandar"" series, the next two series, ""The Comet Empire"" and ""The Bolar Wars"" were normal. I did acquire a tape of the original movie ""Space Cruiser Yamato""-which the Quest for Iscandar series is based on for American audiences- so I at least had a good picture, but it had a drawback too since I don't understand Japanese. Now that I got the first dvd of ""Quest for Iscandar"", I am happy that I have a very clear picture. To all who read this-and to those who may have experienced my problems with the videos-I recommend this dvd."
4,Flashback to childhood,"I ordered this DVD with the expectation that it'd be an amusing return to childhood diversions of getting up early to watch Star Blazers before school. I was pleasantly surprised how well it translated to DVD and how well the story held up. No, it's not a work of genius, and I had hoped for some ""DVD special features"", but it was everything I expected and then some."
4,"5 Star Series, 1 Star DVD","I loved this series as a child and still find the plot interesting. However, the science is a bad, snow on Mars etc. If you can overlook this the story is great. No DVD extras other than chapter search. They make up for this in the second DVD with a scene cut from the original Japanese series, character bios and better navagation. Not the best DVD production, but at least someone is putting this classic series on DVD. A must it you loved the series as a child or for your own children."
3,Not what I expected...,"If you are a Finch or Taking Back Sunday fan, I wouldn't recommend this cd. Yeah, it says this was purchased by people who bought the other ones, but there is no comparison. These guys are really, really different. I can't really say if they are good or bad, but they are nothing like Finch or Taking Back Sunday. Buy with caution."
1,America is Going Deaf,"I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music, as a vivd music listener and an open minded one at that, this music was the most horrid bit of sound I have ever heard. People need to stop and remember what real talent is, not this uncoordinated, bad singing group. Their music is as is they are making up the guitar riffs as they go, and I don't find it difficult to scream. So Glassjaw if your ever in need of a new screamer, I'm your man."
5,Another Amazing Album,"I just bought album a few hours ago, and have listened to it and have to say that it is great. I've been a fan of Gj for a while, and this album is beyond what I expected. I went into this album with an open mind, not looking for another ""Siberian Kiss"" or the next ""Piano"", I was listening to this as if I had never heard GlassJAw before, and I loved it. The songs on this album are wonderful, all as melodic as the can be angry, and beautifully written. I recommend this album to many people, but especially GlassJAw fans, because it's new material with a bit of EYEWTKAS blended with new emotion and matured writting skills. Go buy it, you won't be disappointed."
3,Not as good as the first album,"After giving this album chance after chance, I've given up on it and give it 3 stars for the 3 songs I enjoy which are Tip your Bartender, Ape Dos Mil, and two tabs of Mesculine. After finally receiving my borrowed copy of their first album, I was surprised at how rediculously amazing this album was and it hasn't left my cd player for some time. Worship and Tribute sounds like their first album if you put it in a blender and then poured it randomly on the floor and recorded it. Hope the 3rd album is a little more organized, melodic, powerful, and influential as the first one."
3,"Better, but Also Worse","This album is better musically than GlassJAw's first album, and Darryl's voice has improved. The production is worse, and the lyrics have degraded. There is also much less screaming, and Glassjaw has toned down their heavy riffs into something more classical. Overall, I would still recommend ""Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence"" over this.Overall rating: 3.5 stars"
3,Aggressive ambitions partially achieved,"3 1/2One of those few bands with heavy hardcore influences whose crunching melodies outshine screaming brethren, mainly of course from the distinguished, if over-enunciated and schizophrenic stylings from Palumbo, guiding some misguided or overthought segments but also huge vocal payoffs."
4,Rock Solid,"This is a very good album. It took me a few listens to get into it, but now I find myself listening to the album in its entirety 15 to 20 a day."
5,"Oh, the TEXTURE of it!","I liked EYEWTKAS not for the lyrics (which I actually thought were sub-par), but for the interesting musical soundscapes the rest of the band created. This CD is even better in that sense. From the first five seconds, in which a guitar riff moves from one speaker to another, you know that you are in for a musical odyssey of heavy riffs, frantic drumming, and frequent change within songs, a journey that increasingly few bands can take you on nowadays. Probably the best description of this work would be ""Dillinger Escape Plan goes emo."" If you like complex, intense rock with frequent tempo changes, get this CD right now. The only songs I don't like are ""Cosmopolitan Bloodloss"" and ""Ape Dos Mil,"" the first two singles. Oh well, maybe they'll get some emo kids to stop listening to their other music... and get some taste."
5,"knowing you're right, won't you heal?","After hearing this album for the first time, I was both stunned and blown away, not just by the music but how much glassjaw has evolved. They went from angst filled screaming desires to a more positive anger and more flow with the music. Right when this album starts, you will automatically get pulled into the music and whether you like it or not, you will be shown all the capabilites that glassjaw has. From Daryl's vocals to Larry's drumming, everything has changed but for the better. It's amazing just to hear how much Daryl's voice has changed. This album is definitely not a disappointment and I have had it in my stereo everyday since I've got it. It's impossible to put down and hopefully their next album will be the same way. Great job guys."
3,Good begining...,"This book was really good, it had adventure, amazing plot twists, and fleshed-out characters. Then, Paulsen just seemed to get tired of writing. The main character was just by chance whisked off and dropped back home. I mean, that could have happened any time in the story. I liked the book but was highly disapointed with the ending."
4,The Transall Saga,"I read the Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen. I have read many other books by him , and so far this is my favorite. I gave it a four star rating because it is really interesting, has realistic characters, but lacks good description. The plot is really exciting and I loved the ending. The characters had realistic personalities that were easy to identify. it lacked good description, though, for the other senses besides sight. It is a good blend of a sci-fi and a survival story. I would recommend it to anyone older than 13 that likes these genres of writing."
4,This book is cool,I rated this book four stars because I think that they should have made a second one or they should have made this one longer. It is a very adventurous book. So if you like adventurous books read this one.
5,A must get book!,"I have not enjoyed a book in a long time as much as I have with this one. The story is great, how the author describes everything with great detail that makes you feel as though you are there with the kid. It does start a little slow, but it gets so deep and amazing the more it you read it. The end, was a great ending to a book. I highly recommend this book to any age, but I do feel its for the younger audiance, but it'll prove a great read for anyone that likes adventure books."
4,Transall Saga,"My opinion on this book is that it is one of the best books that is have ever read out of this series. Yes, Brians Winter is a good book in all but Transall Saga blows it out of the water. With the time traveling and how he has to learn a hole different way of life and speak a hole differnt language it really cool. Beacause of all the changes and every thing that goes on between Mark and the other tribes it is really differnt type of book that i have read. This book i would recommend for people from the 5th grade to all the way to my grade(8th). All and all this is one of the best book I have ever read, and hopefully you will ever read."
5,A good book,This book is really good. Oce you get past the begining you won't want to put it down. It was a survival-science fiction. I had never read anything like it before.
5,The Transall Saga,"This book is not the usual Gary Paulsen book. But it is the best one of his I have ever read. It is about a boy who loves the nature, and hits the jackpot when his parents let him go backpacking across the Magruder Missile Range.He finds a mysterious blue light. When he aproaches it it transports him to another world. He struggles to get back to his parents. At first he does not think he will survive and get back to his parents. But his journeys show that he is more than skillfull to survive this world. At times he forgets what is importantand struggles to get back on track. It is a very good book about a boy and his struggle to get back to his family."
4,The Transall Saga,"I thought this book was a very good book. It had elements of fantasy, but it also delt with survival. I liked many of the characters and their personalities. The events were interesting, but the book was sort of slow between them. The ending was ok, but I think that the author needed to elaborate more on what happened when he first returned. There was nothing about his parent's reaction. Overall, I think I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure."
5,Buy This Book,"My boyfriend gave me this book with the words, ""I read this when I was in like, 8th grade, and loved it. But don't think it's a kids book...just read it, okay?"" I was skeptical but so glad he finally coaxed me into starting. This book is GREAT. The characterization is excellent, there's a perfect amount of side characters, description of the world, action, to keep everything flowing but you're still engaged in the thing. Really, a great book; I'd recommend it especially if you have a tween boy who you want to coax into reading. The only complaint I have is the ending--the last fifty pages, at least--felt really rushed and I was conflicted over the ending. That's not to say it isn't suitable for the book, because it's a perfect ending, but it's because you're so invested... well, you'll see, because you just HAVE to read it."
3,Unsatisfying ending,"I read The Transall Saga to my two children, ages 13 and 7. The 7 year old thought it was a great book. The 13 year old thought it was good until the end. He hated the ending. I thought the book lacked depth and description and the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. If this book had a sequel, it would be a decent series for youngsters 12 and under."
5,WINNER,"This book is about a boy that's on a solo camping trip. When he sees a blue light, he walks to it. Then a rattlesnake bites him,and he falls back into the light. Then he finds himself in what seems to be another time on another planet. Now he must survive and find the blue light again in a world that he has no clue about. On his quest, he lerns some shocking things about earth.When I read the Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen , I just could not put it down. I thought it was so cool. I read it in one day--that's 248 pages! If you like books that have adventure, I think you will like this book. I think this was the coolest book I ever read."
5,The Transall Saga:school reveiw,"Wow!This book was excellent,I don't think there's one part I disliked.I would rate this book with 5 stars because it was outstanding how Gary Paulsen matched the characters with what they feel.I liked how Mark was able to survive in another culture ,after being transported from the desert in a blue light to another planet in another time.I really liked how Mark became a very important member(a warrior) of the Tsook.I thought it was a little weird though, how Mark fell in love with the cheif's daughter,Megaan, from the Tsook, rather then the slave that he had known from when he first got there.I was suprised at how many people turned against Mark and wanted to be the one to stop the outlander.If you like science ficton and mystery, this is the book for you."
3,"Christie From YoKoTa, JaPaN",... The only people that should read this book is if you like adventurous and mystery like books. the part that got me was when he got his parents to let him go into the dessert alone.If it was me i would never go into the desert alone. if you want to find out thats in the desert you have to read the book....
5,Great for a sequel,"First, if you have not read this book you have to read it, you are hooked from chapter 1. It would be great if Gary Paulsen wrote a sequel like brian's winter. What if the blue light never came and he had to make a life living on the new planet earth. I think a sequel to this book would be as great as the Hatchet sequels. Please send responses to this."
4,"The Cartoonish Insects & Slide Feature ""Bugs"" Me!","Charles Reasoner has designed a whole series of these interactive sliding books. All of them will probably have to be read with your child since the sliding feature is simply too hard to them to work. Each pages describes the action of a particular bug and then asks which bug does such and such. In all of his books, the animals are hidden between the page (which you are supposed to pull apart to reveal the animal). If your child was to look at it alone, he would simply be viewing pages of scenery. The bugs also look very cartoonish and don't entirely resemble what they are supposed to be. Having said this, I don't regret the purchase and recommend this book - with some reservations."
2,Not his best,"This is the third of Burke's Robicheaux books I've read, and, in my opinion, the worst. to give him credit, Burke's descriptions are ethereal, his characterizations (at least, of Dave & Clete) are vivid and make you care. Unfortunately, his political rants honk unpredictably and obnoxiously throughout his books (especially this one) like an amateur tuba player in a beautiful symphony. I want to be entertained, not preached at. There are also times that his denouements leave much to be desired. As as mystery-reader, the puzzle is very important to me. I want it to make sense, and I want the loose ends tied up."
3,"Good writing, but short on plot","Dave Robicheaux and Annie are married and live in New Iberia, far away from the trouble in New Orleans. They are happy with their bait shop business until a plane crashes and Dave saves the only survivor-a little girl named Alafair. Annie and Dave adopt her, but the family is put in danger when Dave starts asking questions about the plane crash, particularly why Immigration only reported three people died, when Dave knows there were four. Then a brutal murder takes place and causes Dave to go on another alcoholic bender. In the end, It's not clear who the murderer was and why. But oh can Burke write!"
2,Unfulfilled,"I listened to this one on tape. The reader was perfect for the part. The story, however, left me high and dry. I felt like I'd fallen asleep and missed the part where he avenges his wife. Maybe I did. This was a depressing story for the most part but done by a talented writer. Too bad it seemed to stop instead of end. Loose ends left blowing in the wind all over the place."
5,Love James Burke,"Burke is one of my favorite authors, I have read everything he writes, I am now rereading some of my old favorites on Kindle and I would highly recommend this to readers who appreciate great ""visual"" writers who put you ""on the scene"", Burkes books are dark, violent, moody with great indepth character studies, unexpected plot twists, eccentric but believable personalities, and dialogue that is brilliant."
5,Heaven's Prisoners,James Lee Burke is my favorite author and once again he didn't disappoint. I have read all of his work and recently traveled to New Orleans and found it like it had been described in his novels. Its like I had been there before. I consider him the best writer in his field. His character development is uncanny. He can't publish them fast enough for me.
3,good,"I bought this book at very cheep price. Although the book is old, it is good deal for me. Condition of the book is good. NO trouble for receiving the book."
4,Great Read!,"This book is great. This is a fantasy novel that does not involve a quest, is self-contained, and the CHARACTERS are the most important element--not the quest. The only probelem is that the story takes awhile to move forward. However, you don't really notice because the characters are so interesting and fun to read."
5,"Amazing, absolutely amazing",I read this book in 4 hours only getting up to use the bathroom. I recommend this book to all high action fantasy lovers who like to be pushed over the edge as subtle as a hammer blow to the cranium. It is amazing is all. The plot is original as well and will keep you turning those pages.
3,Simple tale,"Well, this was a simplistic tale, quick read while waiting for the Masters to release their next of their series (RR Martin, Anthony Ryan, etc...) I would feel must better if this whole series was price at the 3.99 or worst 4.99 but as is, its overpriced for what it is.For 7.99 you can get the omnibus Theft of Swords (Riyria Revelations) and it has two books of the series (the other two Omnibus books are also 7.99 each). Point being that there are better and cheaper alternatives, this was my first David Gemmell book so I did not know what to fully expect. Check out ""The Hammer and the Blade"" by Paul Kemp, great fun, well written and 4.89!"
4,Objective and Informative,"It would be easy for anyone embarking on a exploration into new religious movements to be swayed by the sensationalist media reporting that many of these groups have been subjected to. This book, however, deals with a host of faiths and belief systems in a subjective and unbiased way, however bizarre they appear to be. Even Jim Jones gets a fair hearing!A great source of information for anyone interested in NRM's which wets the appetite for further study."
4,...hot tunes,"i would just like to mention ,for any body who may be comtemplating this CD that it totally kicks *** .It has all the classic Black Dog atmospheere of BYTES and especially THE TEMPLE OF TRANSPARANT BALLS, in my opinion this cd is an essential part of any BLACK DOG collection.The first track is SUUUUPERB!P.S dont buy MUSIC FOR ADVERTS ...."
1,Big disappointment,"Bought my new Sony and in less than four weeks did not work. Calling Sony just left me with buzy signals. Finally got through and they gave me no help, finally got fixed and is broken again after 6 months........WON`T buy another Sony....."
2,Cheap wood with lots of visible flaws.,"Cheap, rough wood with lots of visible flaws and wood filler. Luckily, I did not need it for finishing purposes."
4,Putting it in the wrong order?,"I agree with others here that this is probably Pat Traver's best effort. Just wanted to mention that on my copy of this disc the songs are in a completely different order than they are coded on the disc. The disc is coded in the order the songs appear on the cover, but this is not the actual song order on the disc. Be aware that if you rip this disc to your computer you will have to manually rename the files to..ahem...""Put them straight"".Actual song order on the disc = How the disc is coded:01 Life in London = Life in London02 It Ain't What It Seems = Gettin' Betta03 Speakeasy = Runnin' from the Future04 Runnin' from the Future = It Ain't what it Seems05 Lovin' You = Off Beat Ride06 Off Beat Ride = Lovin' You07 Gettin' Betta = Dedication08 Dedication = SpeakeasyKind of sloppy execution, if you ask me. Oh well, still a great disc. Buy it!"
5,Pat Travers. Putting it Straight,"Bought it many years ago on vinyl and still have it! Had to buy it it again in a more modern format.Simply one of my all time favorite albums. Pat is one of the most under rated guitar players out there. If you purchase this, you won't be sorry."
3,"great album, lousy cd","this was one of my favorite albums about 30 years ago. it had a sonic impact that was kind of fresh. i've been looking for it on cd ever since cd's were invented, and could never find it. so i was really excited to find it on amazon. and really disappointed when i listened to it. sound quality is the worst i've heard on digital.pat travers appeal was his musicianship, this isn't punk rock. this is like trying to enjoy ""kind of blue"" on a tinny sounding AM radio.i still give it 3 stars, just for the music. you can't find these songs anywhere else, and the album is a masterpiece. somebody, please, do a state of the art digital remaster of this recording. it deserves it!"
5,Quintessential Pat Travers,"I recently bought this CD after listening to cassette copies that I made off the original LP for many years. After wearing out both the record and the Cassette(s) I was thrilled to see it re-released on CD. I have seen PT several times live and have always thought this was his best stuff. I played guitar in a rock band during the late seventies and Pat's tunes were a refreshing addition to our set lists. We just loved jamming on ""Gettin' Betta"", ""Life in London"", and other Pat Travers songs. He is truly one of the great all-time rockers and IMHO this is his best. Every track is great!As an aside, I have great seats to see him at our local venue here in Annapolis, MD (Ram's Head Tavern) on November 28, 2005. I will be about 20 feet from the stage and can't wait!"
3,Nice little book,"This small book contains about 50 different animal connect the dots projects. Each picture has a little hint, such as ""If you come too close, I'll hop away"" for a bunny. After the child is done connecting the dots, he or she can use it as a coloring book. This is a good book to take on a road trip."
1,Terrible TV,"My daughter received this TV for Christmas last year. It was very easy to setup and the strwaberry shortcake screen saver on the TV was cute. The TV and DVD players started having problems 6 months after setting it up. The manufacturers warranty only covers 90 days after purchase. I find that awful since both products started having problems shortly after the warranty expired. Even though it is a ""fun"" I would recommend not wasting your money on this TV and/or DVD player."
5,NEIL SADAKA SINGS HIS GREATEST HITS,"This is a GREAT CD, wished I had ordered two! One for home and one for the car."
5,brings out the romantic in me,"These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a ""shot"" in the romance department, one or more of these songs should do it."
2,I think it was edited,"Before I purchased this, I saw cutouts for Heidi Marks role. Many of the scene I saw were not in this version on DVD. I do not know if the film was edited or the cutouts were literally the stuff let out of the final version of the episode. At any rate I did not find Heidi's episode very erotic. It looked like it had been hacked to pieces."
2,drys my skin out,"I liked this face wash the first 2 times I used it but after that I found it very drying. I have pretty sensitive skin, especially in the winter, and I found I had to use twice as much moisturizer after washing my face with this or my face would burn the rest of the day. I'm sure it'll be better once the weather gets warmer. In the mean time I am using it sparingly."
5,Great product,This cleaner is great at removing dirt and keeping my face smooth. Highly recommended.
5,Basis Face Wash,"I love Basis Face Wash. It has a clean, fresh smell and gently cleans my face of all make-up, etc. I used to be able to find this at regular stores, but have not been able to find it for the last year or so. I was thrilled to be able to order it on-line."
5,Great Cleanser,"I received a tube of this in a goody bag at a marathon, and the first time I used it I was hooked. I love the scent and how great my skin feels after I use it. - The 4 pack is a great bargain, especially since it is not the easiest product to find in stores where I live."
3,Bat man is overdue,"While playing with this Dark Night Figuere I relized that its just another plain regular Batman Action figure. I mean soon ther will be Batman Skateboarding figuers, even Batman Super Cape And Batman Double Punch. Ther is way to many, TO MANY Batman TOYS. IT IS LIKELY OVERDUE."
2,Horrible figure!!!,It is horrible because the Batman logo is off-center and the eqwipment does not help Batman in battle. The eqwipment can easily detach.
1,Chandipath,The quality of CD is hopeless. Thre are too many glitches. I could not listen all the contents. CD jumps from one song to third song. I will not recommand to buy this CD. The problem is processing of CD. All the songs are excellent and music is very good. The printed label on CD came off.
2,Sloppy research,"Although Desjardins' book contains a number of interesting revelations, his arguments are often compromised by sloppy research. For example, his key claim that ""Little Round Top"" was not known by that name until ""years"" after the battle was proven false nearly a decade ago. Desjardin is especially weak when he tries to play photo-detective. He mentions with praise the research of photo historian William Frassanito, but doesn't seem to have actually read Frassanito's books very carefully. Desjardin's arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent, but contrary information"
3,"Good service, not a perfect match","This product came quickly and in good condition. Although it is advertised to work with an Acer Aspire 5000. The one plug is too small for the outlet, but it still works if the power cord is not moved. They hand no problem with a return."
2,Doesn't fit exactly,Not an exact fit for my Acer laptop. I have to press it in hard to keep it charged. :( U get what you pay for
1,I could vomit,"Seperate civics lessons for boys and girls? Give me a break. A real thriving democracy should certainly tolerate this authors right to free expression but not go so far as to support it by buying it. My son can sew, if I have a daughter she'll know how to build a fence. That's not pansy p.c. philosophy, that's the foundation of a strong republic."
1,Moll Flanders,This book has the honor of being one of only two books that I have ever read that I TRULY regret having wasted my time on. I really and truly did not think that I would be able to finish this one BUT I ALWAYS finish a book once I start it. In my opinion this is one of those cases when a very controversial novel gets confused with a great novel. I am however VERY grateful that I picked it up at a library sale for only 50 cents.; 0 ) Sorry Moll Flanders fans.
2,Moll Fllanders,I had purchase this book before but not from Amazon. This edition is not what I had expected. I was looking for a student edition. Also this book had been wrtitten inside the pages
2,Only For Students of the Novel.,"This was the first book I had to read for the history of the novel in college. While I was working my way through this, I wondered if the rest of the class would be this slow. Moll does not command respect, pity or admiration. The scenes for the most part are not really memorable, and the supporting characters are not really convincing. Perhaps this is my biggest complaint. Charles Dickens can keep my interest even in an 800 page book. Yet Defoe could not hold my interest in 250 pages. The only reason I could give for reading this is that it shows a primitave stage in the development of the novel."
5,Better than Robinson Crusoe,"I really liked the way the story unfolded, its voice, and how real it all seemed. Its like a very well written window opening into a different time and allowing you to see things from a different perspective. Defoe allows you to become Moll and feel what she's feeling- something you really can't get from movies.I'm surprised this book isn't more widely read. I mean with nice writing, plenty of sex, and daring characters you'd think this book would have more reviews. :)I recommend this book not only for those of you who enjoy fine writing for its own sake, but also to those who like an intriguing tale about adulteresses. A+ Defoe."
3,Romance rollercoaster!,"Moll Flanders is one of the few 'classic' books I have read in which a MALE author parallels the thought of a woman as the narrator. Moll Flanders is the ultimate tribute to a woman out to make a name for herself in a world of poverty, protitution, and love, who eventually learns more about her own strengths than the lessons of any morals. Moll Flanders is an embodiment of feminism... but oddly enough is written by a male author-giving the text a female and male essence of love, twists, and, of course, misfortunes."
3,Wondering how true to life she was..,"I read this several years ago. Didn't have much of a problem with the writing style, but others might.As a mom, I just couldn't get over the fact she gave birth to about 10 kids, didn't give a flying leap about any of them, and abandoned every single one of them at her earliest convenience. I have heard of a lot of REALLY bad mothers, but none that just walked away, never gave another thought to any of them - on about 6 different occasions.My modern mind wants to guess she had reactive attachment disorder since she was abandoned herself, but of course she just may be the imagining of a man who didn't really care to write about a woman's relationships with her children. (Wikipedia says he had 8 kids by the same wife and 6 survived, so he should have known of the bond a woman has with her children).It's an interesting book, but I can't fully recommend it as a story. I would recommend it for people interested in 17th and 18th century England and America."
2,I find this Book practically unreadable,"Let Me start by saying that the Story of Moll Flanders itself is a fairly exciting One. The Story changes Venues and Circumstances so often that it only grows Dull in a few Places. It is well-written and filled with beautiful Description. However, I have never finished this Book due to two crucial Criteria:Reason 1) There are no Chapters. I find this to be quite Discouraging, as, without any Breaks, I often lose my Spot and feel like I'm not accomplishing Anything.Reason 2) Just like in this Review, every Noun is capitalized. If you found it annoying Here, just imagine 300 Pages of it.I would not recommend this Book to any casual Reader. If you're a literary Scholar, however, dive right in, it's an important Work."
2,enlightened ??,"This is one of the most depressing books I hope to ever read. The best summation I can give is, oh so there were just as many dishonest, stealing thieves in times past as there are today.It would be a good study for criminal minds and how to make light of ripping people off. I hated the book and am disappointed that it even falls into the classification of 'The Classics'"
3,Movie: Misguiding of book,"Having watched the movie version of this book starring Robin Wright and Morgan Freeman. I went on a quest to read the book and, of course, turned to Amazon.com for purchase. However the reviews of the book do not match the movie. The movie portrays Moll as a ""born in a prison, prostitute"" and the reviews portray her as a ""mulitple marriage failing mother"" (In which case, the movie version of a book, has yet again disappointed the reader, much like ""Gone with the Wind"" did. Both were masterpieces, but the movie was rather disappointing after reading the book.) If you're reading Moll Flanders based on viewing the movie, like I have done, please don't let it disuade you. Read on...."
3,"""Moll Flandes"" is an interesting view of human behavior.","""Moll Flanders"" is the story of a girl who was born in a prison. Through out Moll's youth she is determined to become a respectable and self sufficient woman. In effort to avoid becoming a servent she starts stealing to assure her independents. Over all the story is intriguing, however is difficult to stay interested in due to the redundancy of themes (failed marriages, greed, deceit,etc.)."
1,Made me sorry to have the gift of sight.,"I had to read this for a book club, and a fifth of the way into it, I began to wish I were blind, so I wouldn't have to continue. I considered gouging my eyes out with a grapefruit spoon. And if someone tried to read aloud it to me, I was prepared to pour hot parrafin into my ears. And if Anne Sullivan tried to sign ""Moll Flanders"" into my hand, I would dig into my wrists and sever the nerves to my hand with a carpet knife. Then if someone tried to tap the text of this book onto my back using Morse Code, I would be left with no course of action other than suicide. As it was, I completed my book club obligation, and as soon as we're done discussing this, I'm going to bandsaw open my cranium, locate the part of the brain that remembers I read this book, and scoop it out with a melonballer. Wish me luck!"
4,enjoyed,I enjoyed all of Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate books. They are not predictable and she has a great sense of humor. If you like something a little different I would recommend this series.
2,Not for me,"Don't care for the story line.Too, distasteful and hardly worth reading even if it was the last book I had.."
3,It was never easy being a poor woman!,"This book helped me to understand the perils of being a poor woman in Seventeenth Century London. The character Moll Flanders was born poor and she had no family to support her, therefore her only ways of survival was to get married, sell her body, become a servant at very low wages. She chose to become a thief, and to always to appear to be something that she was not.It is almost like a travel book because Moll is always moving from town to town, and from life episode to next episode, across the ocean trying to find a place to be herself and not a fake representation of a good woman.Sometimes the narrator is too detailed and tells more than I needed to know, but it does seem like a woman is speaking, or writing in a journal, even though the book was actually written by a man. I enjoyed reading the book and felt some sympathy for Moll Flanders because of her struggles, weaknesses, and her ability to endure."
4,good story but annoying as well,"I have been trying to read this book for several months now and I can't become interested enough to get into it for more than one or two evenings a month. The story itself is intriguing but seems to go on forever, though the novel itself is quite short. Keeping all the men in Moll's life straight gets confusing. Renting the movie would be much less cumbersome."
3,"a book worth reading, but only once","I enjoyed the ending of the book because I felt as if I knew Moll but I felt the plot repeated itself and she continiously did the same things. Parts dragged but her strong will is inspirational. If you're a lover of classic novels, you'll enjoy this."
3,Just rent the BBC version!,"I saw the BBC version of this book when it was on PBS a few years ago and greatly enjoyed it, but I can't seem to be able to finish the book! The first page tells you everything: 12 years a prostitute, 5 times a wife, 12 years a thief, 8 years a felon, and at last grew rich, lived honest, and died a penitent. It has some interesting things to say about love and marriage, but boy is it hard to get through!!"
2,Not the worst,As far as school books go it could have been much worse.it dragged and there were too many monitorial references.
3,unbelievable survival of a 16th century woman,"it's all about a woman who marries a lot of different men, steals to survive, and finally settles in virginia. during her pillaging years she dresses up as a man, goes under other names and is many a time near capture. She is the most wanted thief in Newgate, many people have been sent to jail because of her. This book is her own fervid recolletion of her memories."
3,"Good for the layman, but disapointing to physicists","Kaku is doing a service by writing in the format he did: I have recommended this book to many friends of mine who know nothing of physics. But I would not recommend this to anyone who actually studies string theory and higher dimensional subjects; this book exaggerated quite a few things that shouldn't have been focused on, and it read more like a story-book than a physics text. In other words, it's great if you don't plan on delving into the field very far, but if you're an aspiring student, I'd much rather have you read Feynman's lectures."
3,A bit dated,"The book was written in 1995.The writing style is not bad though there are several excursions into philosophy which are very speculative.If you have never read any layperson book before on string theory, this would be a good start.If you have already read Brian Greene etc, there is not much more that you can get from this book, especiallysince this book is older. Having watched Michio Kaku on TV, I was curious to read one of his books; hence picked this up.The one point I carried away from this book (which I have not seen mentioned elsewhere) is Kaku's assertion that the Physics is well-understood and all we are lacking is some ""21st century Maths"" to solve the equations that come up in String Theory (which is often described as a piece of 21st century Physics that just happened to be discovered in the 20th century)"
2,Interesting story,This book is more of a story than it is actual science. The foundation and basis of the theory is assumed rather than explained.
5,"Highly entertaining and addictive, Kaku shows his stuff",Very interesting. Kaku is entertaining and very readable. Not too much math :( but it is a good book book for an intro to multi-dimensional physics.
1,Didn't grab me,"I usually like books about weird science, but I have to say that this one didn't grab me-- maybe because I got to it right after reading Kip Thorne's book on Black Holes and Time Warps. It's ok, but didn't seem special."
4,Our tiny world,"I loved how this book brought out multiple aspects of the atomic world and explained them in terms of our physical world. The book is somewhat technical, yet still not difficult for an amateur to understand. It gets into some uncertain terrain, much like STILL PITYING THE FOOL, which can be a lot fun if you're up for it."
5,Great for core understandings,"Very good read - for the acolyte who's background is not in physics but interested in the topic, this books was great for me. Some of the supporting proof seemed a little weak, but heck, I'm not sure I'm qualified to dispute it.I'll read it again - that's the best recommendation that I can give."
5,You don't have to be a rocket scientest to understand this.,"Kaku does a good job of explaining the basics of the different mechanics of modern day thoughts about quantum theroy... While this book does contain a great deal of speculation, its more like Kaku invites us all into a group of scientists and fills us in on all the ""gossip"", the speculations that are out there being proven or disproved right now. If you want a book to introduce you to quantum theroy, hyperspace, and space-time, Kaku's may just be the best one out there. And from this book it is much easier to move on to Hawking and the other big brains of therotical physics..."
2,Abracadabra.,"If you're not yet convinced that there is a clearlink between modern physics and the Delphi Oracle,this book will probably convince you.The problem is that if you know what the author istalking about, you really think it is nuts topresent it that way, and if you don't know, you won'tlearn anything.On the other hand, if you want to be on a Star Trektrip, it is fun to read. But it has nothing to dowith physics."
2,NOT for theoretical physicists,"I praise Kaku's lucid literary writing style, but condemn everything else about this popular physics book. Kaku mystifies physics and makes it look like some sort of cult which deals with surreal objects such as ""hyper-dimensions"" and ""warped space"" - whatever those things mean to the average person who hasn't completed his PhD in supersymmetry. Reading Kaku's book is similar to reading a science fiction novel or watching an episode of star trek - things that have nothing to do in practice with physics. What ever happened to wondering about why the sky is blue, or how a radio works? Geez ... if you're into mysticism, try this book. If you're into physics, try another."
1,Lacks substance,"Scanning the reviews of ""Hyperspace"" I see that many want to give this book five stars. I find myself in the 1- and 2-star minority.""Hyperspace"" is the kind of book that makes people think they've learned something without actually having done so.This is the problem with ""learning"" by analogy. The presentation of many -- perhaps most -- of the concepts covered in this book might help one learn to talk about them, but not to actually understand them. Analogy goes only so far. Experiment is the crucible and if you don't explain the experimental and theoretical basis for results, then you have taught nothing. This is a flaw of much science writing (e.g. the second half of ""A Brief History of Time"").""Hyperspace"" started out interestingly enough, but the farther it went, the more it lost its bearings. A sense of wonder is a fine stimulus, but science is more than a word game of analogies. I read the whole thing, but the time I spent reading it felt wasted."
3,Good book,"The author presents the subject matter in an interesting way. He should stay away from the topic of evolution and religion, though."
3,Hyperspace just a bit dated,"Not a bad book at all, interesting and different perspectives on the same topics that I have found in other sources. the only issue I have is that it is a bit old. 1993"
4,An accessible introduction,"I bought this book when I was just starting to get interested in learning about the craziness of physics and quantum mechanics. I found it to be a very enjoyable and accessible introduction/overview of some of the key concepts without going overboard by drawing questionable conclusions or making iffy speculations as to what it could all implicate like many ""new physics"" books are wont to do.Overall engaging, interesting, and recommended."
3,For the non scientific,"This book was more like popular fiction, then true science. It had lots of fluff but not much substance. I would recommend this book only for those who are starting out in Physics. It read like a slow Science Fiction book. The writing style was not bad, just overly redundant with no real lessons."
4,A good intellectual exercise,"This book was particularly good because of its simplicity and elegant style of writing. The concepts are explained fluently, and they are in a layman's terms. Sometimes the author repeats his views again and agian and it becomes boring. However, I have to admit that your view about the universe can be influenced by this book. You are forced to challenge some simple and basic concepts. Is space a void? is it flat? It is hard to beleive that ""space itself can curl due to gravity"". But it was even hard to beleive that earth was not flat.You can appreciate Einstein's work in this context. However, I do not agree that time is 4th dimension as stressed repeatedly in this book.This book is good for you if you have learnt basic high school physics. Enjoy!"
5,The Problem with Physics,The major problem that those who have opinions or theories on physics but no doctorates degree is that no one will listen to them. We need to stop making physics follow the equations and start making it follow the evidence. The equations can wait if you can prove that something works. This book opens the minds of all of us non-proffessors and allows us to start to think that maybe our ideas aren't so strange after all
4,Very entertaining read,"It has a great start and a great end. The middle is taken up by much complicated physics that is difficult to follow. However, once Kaku begins to describe ways in which we might begin to probe the 10th dimension and civilizations that may have done so alredy, it becomes engrossing. It is certainly too much for the casual reader, but for lovers of science fiction or science in general, it is a fascinating book."
4,"Here's the problem,","There are lots and lots of books out there about science, but very few that actually inspire with science, and even fewer that truly teach it tothe general audience. Kaku is usually pretty good, but I think he sometimes turn into tinsel. My two favorite books on modern science right now are Brian Greene's Elegant Universe, and a new one by Leon Lederman and Christopher Hill called ""Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe."" I'd say either start with Greene to wet the appetite, then do Lederman and Hill, or start with Lederman and Hill so you are ready for Greene. I'll be teaching poets with these books. These books set the standard that you will see most other books fall far short of. With these books as my ""5 stars grade"" I rank this one accordingly."
5,Simply the best of its kind !,"For those with basic knowledge in physic, this is really what you need to start.Trust me, I've read tons of books from Paul Davies, John Gribben, Martin Rees, others ... but it's too difficult to comprehend. It covers most if not all the basic stuffs that you need to know. Not only that it was very well written, it was also structured just like any other good novel. A must have for physic lover !"
2,A little on the fluffy side,"Although ""Hyperspace"" is fairly easy to read, and does have some interesting ideas in it, it's a little light on the science compared to other books I've read. That might be due to the fact that the subject matter is still in the theoretical stage. But, still, much of the book is anecdotal and many of the analogies used to explain the main theories are repetitive and off-subject. Plus, the book (and the information inside) is pretty out of date. Kaku often refers to things that might happen by the year 2000. This book is more useful for light reading than for really learning about unification theories and multi-dimensional universe models."
2,Lots of fluff,"If you are thinking about reading this book then PLEASE consider reading Brian Greene's ""The Elegant Universe"" instead. It does a much better job on string theory and it is more current with the latest scoop on the second superstring revolution.The second half of Hyperspace is light on content. There is a lot of filler. After reading it, I thought that it was because there was not much else in the way of superstring theory advances. Hyperspace is truly outdated because of its '94 print date. The second superstring revolution began in 1995 which means you are missing out on a number of recent advances. Greene's book gives you the full history of string theory plus the most recent work which was much more fufilling."
3,"An Interesting, but Monotonous, Book","This book covers a wide area of modern physics as it title suggests, and does so in an acceptably thorough manner, but the author often repeats himself and often ends up beating a dead horse (or two-dimensial worm in this case) with his tiring examples and writings. Overall, a good book to read if a friend has it and you have no other access to any better books, but not one to buy. There are better, more thorough,a nd more interesting books."
3,Gorgeous!,"This is a gorgeous gravy boat--I love all the glass carving in it--and it is priced appropriately, I think. I bought it on Amazon. But I do wish it came with a saucer because, if you're actually going to use ths gravy boat for a meal, gravy drips and you need a saucer to catch the drippings. Guess I'll have to buy a separate saucer to go with the Goldinger gravy boat."
5,Superb text!,"In my University years, I must confess there was any other issue in the Engineering career capable to match (in what difficult concerns) than Dynamics. I consider that this isolated discipline is the seventy per cent of the whole difficultness in the Five Years.Harry Nara was my beacon in the darkness, his polished concepts, kind presentation, fundamental exercises and that easy going conciseness and accuracy at the moment of solving ""heavy problems"" , constituted to me the friendly hand that saved me from the waters.Go for this, I still use it in my Consulting Timing ""to help"" the new students generations."
5,My favorite collection of their songs,"There are several CDs out that have collections of the Chiffon songs. All of the CDs have their big hits like ""He's So Fine"" and ""One Fine Day"" and most of their medium hits like ""Up on the Bridge"". Each of the CDs also has some ""not so big hits"", which vary with the collection. I like this collection the best. All of the CDs have been digitally remastered, so the sound on all of them is better than the original records."
1,Avoid if possible,"This book is riddled with mistakes from incorrect derivations to incorrect tables in the appendix. Our class has our own lengthy errata webpage. As for the meat of the book, the derivations are not really fleshed out, and there are very few examples to go by. Except for one chapter devoted to applied problems, I lack to see how this book is called ""very applied""."
5,looking for a song,"Many years ago Entertainment Tonight closed their show with a performance by Tiny Tim. It was a country song about lost love and regret but the one line I remember, and has me searching endlessly is, ""...but if you're going to leave me, leave me satisfied.""A little help will be appreciated."
3,"Haven't bought yet, got a question for those who have","TT recorded a song with the refrain (if not the title) ""The icecaps are melting."" I think it was on God Bless Tiny Tim. That title doesn't show up in the track list on AMZN or on RhinoHandMade.com's track list (Rhino also sells the box set). Does anyone know what happened to that song? Am I mis-remembering the title?"
1,Spk Failure - Mic jack - Charger Issue poor quality control,SPEAKER FAILURES: Turns out the speaker - mic - charger jack is defective on many of these units. After a few charger plug insertions the contact that cuts out the speaker when using a headset fails to make a good connection when the charger plug is removed. Appears to be a class manufacturing problem... Jack contacts are accesible from battery compartment. Press a fine sewing needle point into the small loop contact (use magnifying glass)to make the loop buldge a little more and make a better connection with the other contact. The speaker will then start working again. Problem solved
1,Very Dissappointed,"This camera comes with no instructions or warranty information. The zoom feature doesn't exist as indicated in the technical data and editorial reviews. It doesn't even seem to be the camera advertised, but then who knows for sure when no written information is included."
5,"Gunfighter Ballads, just as I remember them!",I have this record and was glad to see if on CD. Big Iron etc. It's Great!
5,"My ""New Millenium"" Kids Even Love This!","My 4 sisters and I constantly listened to this album (yes, vinyl!) as children, and Marty Robbins was our pretend boyfriend/handsome prince whenever we played. (We almost re-enacted ""El Paso"" fighting over who got to be Felina.) I had forgotten about it until I heard ""El Paso"" played at a local fair. My children (son age 7 and daughter age 5) were mesmerized by the song. I still remembered every word, and I ordered the CD for a road trip. My kids listened to it over and over, and I so enjoyed singing along again. Marty is truly the best country music singer/composer of all time. I bet my kids grow up and pass this along to their children."
5,Best of the Gunfighter ballads!,"Marty Robbins is the original when it comes to gunfighter ballads. I listened to this on LP at my grandfather's 40 years ago; when he passed on, he left it to me. But I play the CD now.Simply outstanding."
5,raised on gunfighter ballad's,my dad used to always play this album when I was a little kid in the seventies. I still really enjoy hearing these old song's.
5,Husband this one,"My husband has always liked to listen to Marty Robbins, and this CD fits the bill. He doesn't usually listen to CDs, but he listens to this one."
5,not dissapointed,the cd was good as new no scrathes just good clean sound.Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs
4,Good old music,"Us old farts need music too. I had it on a record and wanted a new one, because I enjoy this old real music."
5,This Masterpiece is the greatest album in Country-Western history!,"Marty Robbins / Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs (bonus tracks CD): In 1959, the U.S. was crazy for Westerns (Movies, Television, Toys, Clothes and Music). In that year, Marty Robbins recorded this album which not only turned out to be the greatest County-Western album of all time, it is an album that stands besides the other contenders (in Rock, Country, Folk, etc) as one of the Greatest Albums of All Time. Some of these songs Robbins wrote, while others are covers and still more are traditional. The total effect is a moving Western fantasy unequalled in its brilliance. This album is Highly Recommended.This is a Masterpiece album and it deserves a Sixth Star."
5,Walk down memory lane,"I had heard El Paso on the radio, and, just had to have the whole album!! Great sound and quality..."
1,Them folks done messed it up,"I was so excited to find out that this record was finally remastered until I found out that they completely changed the order of the songs how they originally appeared. To listen to an older recording is to listen to how other folks listened to it at the time. It's rather wrong to mess up the original sequence of things. It's fine to add extra tracks at the end of the album, but for crying out loud, don't mess with the song order. Marty would be rolling in his grave I'm sure."
5,Marty Robbins at his best,"WE who love the old west and Marty Robbins find it all in this album. The song are of a period long gone but you feel like you are there as this album unfolds. The extra songs are like a gift for fans who have followed Marty since his first appearance on The Grand Old Opery. I thought i knes all 0f his songs but was suprised as I listened to ""The Rose"" and other new songs on this album. It was like getting to visit with a friend who has passed away."
5,"I'd like to take a Big Iron,","and use it on the talentless, commercialized, white trash trolls who call themselves ""country"" singers today: that idiot Trace Adkins and his hip-hop country rap crap, and Kenny Chesney et al- you guys aren't fit to shine Marty Robbins's boots. Marty is the real deal- great voice, talented guitarist, master lyricist. This disc has a great Western feel- my personal favorites here are ""Running Gun"" and ""The Master's Call."" Put this in your CD player and hit ""play through""- there isn't a bad song on here. If you're a fan of the ""Honky Tonk Badon-kadonk"" and other CMT video crap, you best look elsewhere. I hear Wal Mart has some good CD's by a talentless asshat named Garth Brooks."
3,Engaging Story; Easy Reading,"Leeway Cottage tells a family saga through many years. The story involves social changes as well as involvement in, and results of, WWII. It is easy to read, and the characters are interesting, if somewhat inconsistent. Some of the segments describing the war did not seem particularly integral to the story as a whole, but the author does make the point that wartime tragedy remains a specter that affects individuals and families forever."
3,Loose Ends--,"I am giving this book three stars, because it is involving and you want to keep reading. The loose ends really bother me. Early on we learn that Sydney's father's first wife died from complications of childbirth. Later we are told she committed suicide and then nothing more. Very frustrating! It is hinted that Sydney may have been in love with a woman while Laurus is in Europe. We never learn more. Is this just a crumb to titillate or to indicate a change in Sydney? If so it is too inconclusive and leaves the reader feeling of dissatisfied. Jimmy, Sydney's son, drops out and does drugs for ten years. Other than Laurus getting him a job on a lobster boat early on to straighten him out--nobody seems to care. Wouldn't there be some parental hair pulling over this? So while it is a readable book I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction."
3,Maybe I expected too Much...,"The only other book I've read by Ms. Gutcheon was 'More Than You Know', and I loved it. This book however was not nearly as entertaining or interesting.I'm not going to summarize this book, as many here have already done...but my opinion is that the characters were all one-dimensional. Sidney started out OK, with the father she loved passing away too soon, and left with her awful mother. She really wanted to be someone different then what she grew up with, but as she ages, she just turns into another run-of-the-mill demanding rich woman who summers in Maine.I gave this three stars because the idea of the story was interesting, I just don't think it was executed as well as it could have been. The two stories just didn't fit together, and the ending was confusing. What's with that last chapter?In the end...I'll still read Ms. Gutcheon's future novels, but I've learned not to expect as much as I did with this book, because I was definitely disappointed."
1,VERY disappointed!!!,"I thought I would like this book as the subject manner and descriptions sounded interesting. But the author would start a train of thought and then abort the idea and move on to another - I seemed like I was listening to an crudely abridged version! I will NOT read another of hers if this is the way she writes. I was very disappointed...this book could have been great!!!! The characters I felt were shallow and so much more could have been done to deepen their personalities, thoughts and feelings."
5,One of the Best Books Out This Year!,"""Leeway Cottage"" is so good that I tried to SLOW DOWN so I wouldn't finish it too fast...but I couldn't! All the characters are so vivid and interesting and Gutcheon does a fabulous job showing us their growth and change. There was a wonderful wealth of historical information about the Danish experience in WWII that I had never read about before in such rich, if disturbing, detail.To call this novel ""great beach reading"" is to trivialize its impact and depth...but it certainly is the book to select if you want to be transported this summer."
3,Definite Replica,"Saturn V has forever been my favorite rocket of the Apollo era. So, I bought it for my nephew. He loves it. Unfortunately, the needle nose isn't very sturdy, and you are possibly better off going to NASA to find a real durable mission patch. All in all, for the price and the look, it is a good deal."
4,Cool Saturn V Toy,"Well it doesn't do anything, but it's not supposed to! It's heavy, seems to be metal or solid heavy plastic, but it's covered in a hard rubber-like material that is durable and softer than I thought it would be. The pointy top is rubber-like too. The detail is very good and is quite realistic, but the paint could be a bit better."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"I ordered this for my son's birthday, paid the 2 day delivery so it'd arrive in time. After seeing it in its package, I would never have bought this particular one at a store. I ordered it as new but it looks like someone has played with it and put it back in the package. The tip of the rocket is bent, the paint is scratched and smudged and has finger-like prints on it, it's just very poor quality. I expected a little better than what we got, realizing this was a $12 toy, but it should have been in better shape. I'm asking for a full refund, including shipping, as I think it's only fair since I still have to locate this rocket somewhere else and now only have 2 days to get it."
3,Kids love it,"My boys, ages 6 and 7, love this rocket. I do agree with a fellow reviewer that the needle is a bit flimsy but it has been dropped and banged into a wall and seems to be holding up okay. They've had it for three days and so far so good. Now, my husband who is big into rocketry was disappointed in the sloppy paint job and the overall construction of it and wondered how it could be marketed as a collectible. It's a toy. It seems to be durable and able to hold up under multiple ""flights"" with two rambunctious boys. I am not disappointed and niether are the kids. Just keep in mind that it's a toy.On another note, it took almost a month to get it. That was disappointing."
3,Meh,"I used this on my car but quickly realized that dragging this on my car gave me the willies, so I stopped using it. Perhaps I am doing it wrong, but I prefer a synthetic chamois over this unusual piece of kit and would probably freak if I saw a detailer using it on my car. :)"
3,An Easy-to-Use Medical Dictionary with Excellent Audio,"Merriam-Webster's Medical Audio Dictionary is easy to install and use. The program is extremely stable. Definitions are usually succinct. The best feature is its clear, real human pronunciation of medical terminology. Compared to other medical encyclopedias, this dictionary does not contain as many illustrations. But it does give you pronunciations of virtually all medical words and their derivitives (noun, adjective, etc)."
1,It is a NO Star...,"People...Please do not waste your money on this garbage. It is out of date, inaccurate and either too simplistic or too hard to understand (I am a physician's assistant). I'm not sure why Webster is letting the DREADED DELMAR get hold of their titles to ruin them like they are doing. This is the second piece of crap they've made out of something nice."
3,Capturing Light in Watercolor,"Very enlightening text and step-by-step guidelines to paint less but prepare a little bit more. This will lead me to more simplicity, more atmosphere and less picture in future painting."
4,A Spy Among the Girls,"A Spy Among the Girls is fun on its own, but is even more so with the added background of the five earlier books. Naylor's newest book in this series is again centered around the three Malloy girls and their neighbors, the four Hatford boys. Readers will enjoy the fast paced events. They will identify with the children, who in some ways have lives like their own. They will see that problems can be resolved. They will laugh as they discover the answers to questions: Is Josh a spy among the girls, or is he falling for Beth? What is an abaguchie? Will Eddie have a good science fair project with Josh and Jake's assistance? Can Wally escape from Caroline? Does he want to? Is Caroline already an actress? Can the Malloys and Hatfords live peacefully as neighbors? Check out this book and enjoy!"
2,A step backwards,"Having read the previous books in the series aloud to my kids, I was happy to see the next one available. After reading it, however, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. It seemed pretty formulaic. I also was not pleased with the ""suicide,"" though Mom's reaction and subsequent talk with Caroline salvaged the scene somewhat. I have to confess to a little irritation at the kids-know-best-parents-don't-understand angle at the end as well. May her next book be fresher and more family oriented."
5,Get lost in the desert,"This book succeeds in taking me away from the everyday stresses of life and helping me appreciate the West's natural beauty, as well as its inherent danger. It offers a compelling story, interesting history of our country's struggles between preservation and population expansion, and thrilling prose contrasting the peacefulness and dangerous natural wonders of the West. I may actually have to read it again!"
2,disappointing,"I read this book primarily because it is known as a ""classic"" piece of environmental literature. In my opinion, it does not deserve to be considered as such primarily because it is shallow. The basic message that there is value in wilderness for its own sake is obvious. Maybe it was not apparent in the fifties but is obvious now. In terms of preservation, Abbey does not offer any insights other than: stop building roads, stop population growth, keep things as they were in good old times when there was nobody around and i could build fires anywhere i wanted, throw tires in the Grand Canyon, and cut down trees if i felt like it. Not much of an insight."
5,I love this book- but why no Kindle version,One of the greatest books written about the environment - still I do not understand why we would kill trees to print this and not have a kindle version available...
2,Desert Solitaire,"I was disappointed with this book. I expected informative and interesting descriptions of the desert southwest, and there is some of this. However, the author gets so carried away with inappropriate political discussion and criticism of almost everyone and everything, it really detracts from the story. I actual skipped through some of these parts. When he does stay with the natural descriptions, the author is knowledgable and actually quite poetic. Some of his descriptions are over-the-top though with tedious classical and cultural references. Would not recommend this book. I'm sure there are much better books with stories and information on the desert that avoid the political extremism."
2,no story,"This was just a travel log...almost just a daily journal. I expected a story line; a plot. It became more and more of the same, and less and less interesting. When it ended, I was shocked, and my response was, ""that's it?"""
5,The most compelling book on the Red Rock Desert ever,"I originally read the book in the early 1980's and continually reread it to refresh my memories of the most compelling, stark, unforgiving, beautiful, lonely, introspective, sensative, sensational and sensual landscape in the world. The author and his book are monuments, and unfortunately perhaps lone sentinels, to the passion that the red rock desert of the American Southwest inspires in the people who love it."
3,"Interesting, but uneven...","Edward Abbey's collection of essays about his work at the then Arches National Monument(which he calls National Moneymint to mock the villains who wish to pave over everything). Abbey does have some good points, like we should stop trying to pave over things to make it more convineat to see nature. The whole Glen Canyon tragedy is told, foreshadowing the novel ""Monkey Wrench Gang"". I did like his wide knowledge of philosophy and the desert fauna and flora, and I relate to his love of the desert, but his prose is a bit(forgive the pun) too arid, and I had to slog through parts of the book. On the whole, I recommend it."
3,Boring.,"We read it for book club, and while some members liked it and some thought he was anti-animal, it really did not leave much to be discussed. It is well written description, but it moves at a Brady Bunch speed."
4,Interesting intense read,"Wonderful and classic work by Abbey. His descriptions of his desert surroundings take my breath away. Less engaging are his diatribes against the forces bringing in ""progress"" to the wilderness."
4,"If you love the desert, you need to read this book","The first time I went to Moab, UT, I fell in love with the desert. I read this book afterwards and was captivated by every word Abbey wrote. That being said, I have spoken with other people who have never been to the Moab area who just couldn't get into the book. I guess maybe it takes a deep love of the environment and appreciation of the beauty of the desert to really understand this book. Abbey adds in so many interesting stories as well that keep the book flowing. I would defintely recommend this to anyone who loves the desert."
4,"""I would rather kill a man than a snake.""","""I would rather kill a man than a snake,"" wrote Edward Abbey, and I suspect he even meant it. That sentence summed up, for me, this book: it is filled with Abbey's love of the wild desert and its inhabitants and his contempt for modernity and its inhabitants. I think Abbey was one of the early voices in modern environmentalism, and this is a classic book in that field. I appreciate his desert and his writing; even if you are not an environmentalist nor a lover of the desert, you may see why people are if you read this. At any rate, his deep naturalist reflections deserve consideration in our fast-food, internet, climate-controlled, sanitized and artificial age."
3,I try to imagine a ride along the river...,"Edward Abbey is a contradiction. A poet when describing the wonders of the desert and the joys of solitude; then he becomes a strident critic of his fellow man if they have the audacity to disagree with him. There is a definite will and intelligence driving the prose, but it is partially spoiled by the rants that Abbey goes on. The book has a split personality; celebrating the wilderness, but using a voice that often becomes so disagreeable that you might want to take asphalt to the park yourself. Finally though the poet wins out and you go along for the ride. I try to think of this book as rafting down the river, enjoying the wonders and trying to avoid the jagged rocks. A little white water is fine; just don't hold me underwater for hours at a time."
3,this book is ok but not great!,"This book is ok, but not great! It was recommended by others, and I found it a bit disappointing. There were a few very descriptive passages that I liked."
4,Perfect travel companion for the Utah desert...,"I read this book while traveling and hiking solo through Zion, Bryce, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and Capitol Reef. Several of the stories are startling and heartbreaking--the moon-eyed horse, the deadman in grand gulch come to mind. This book is from the late 60s and as a woman reader I thought Abbey came across as pretty sexist, but no matter, the writing is still brilliant in unexpected places."
5,One of the most important books of all time,"The American experience has given to the world two priceless things above all: the fullest development of the idea of the worth and dignity of the individual life, and love and value of wilderness for its own sake. Desert Solitaire is a monument to, and a celebration of, both. It is one of the most important books of all time, for in it is the evolution of human conciousness. I'm grateful to Ed Abbey for his book, and for his encompassing, inspiring vision of the American West."
5,The book is as rare and precious as water in the desert...,"I've been there, the vast, silent desert. I thought no book could transport me back there, such an unworldly experience as it was. But I underestimated the power of Abbey's language. His muscular style, vivid descriptions, left me with pictures in my head, smells under my nose, sounds ringing in my ears. While some books make you feel like you're tackling a mountain, or headed towards a destination, Desert Solitaire successfully echoes the meditative, yet ruthless quality of the desert. His views about the protection of natural beauty are passionate and infectious. It can make you think twice or thrice about the fruitlessness of our petty, material lives. I plan to enjoy this one over and over, as I would a favorite song"
5,"One man, alone, in the land he loves","In this fascinating ecological memoir/rant, Abbey takes us along during his time as a park ranger in the heart of Utah's harsh red rock landscape to expose its beauty and contradictions. While some things have changed since the book's publication in 1968, the majority of Abbey's thoughts and experiences remain timeless. A true classic of environmental nonfiction."
2,Great topic but brought down by the ranting,"When Edward Abbey writes about the natural scenery of Utah it is splendid and a joy. When he moves on to his philosophy it is a struggle to stick through to the next page. The level of his hypocrisy is only matched by the level of his misanthropy. I could respect his opinions if he had quit work and moved to the desert, but he took a job for a capitalist government to tend the needs of the tourists, so all his rants about the same ring hollow. His ideas are what you would expect for a first year college student angry with society, not the deep thinker he takes himself to be. The number of glowing reviews really surprises me. I suspect many of them maybe didn't get passed the first couple chapters (which are great, great chapters). It's a wonderful topic but there are probably better sources out there."
5,"Back in print, August 2000","Mouritz,London, has brought out a new edition of the Universal Constant in Living, F.M. Alexander's last book.Edited and annotated by Jean Fischer, whose editions of 'Man's Supreme Inheritance' and the 'Articles and Lectures' collection have raised the standard for the serious study of Alexander, this promises to be a MUST for teachers and students of the Alexander Technique.The book is a sort of footnote to the earlier books, there is some problem with sprawl. But Alexander never wrote more clearly and succinctly."
5,CD of Spanish Civil War songs,Jamie O'Reilly's voice gives a heartfelt earnestness to this re-interpretation of the well known Spanish Civil War repertory. The ensemble is tight and introduces interesting rhythms to the songs. Many people have asked me how to purchase this CD but i think it is no longer available.
5,What a great CD!,"This CD is really amazing. The songs are so powerful and are sung just beautifully. In response to ""A Music Fan from Israel,"" I'd just like to say that the CD's subtitle is ""Songs of the Spanish Civil War,"" not ""Songs from..."" and I'm sure that the title was not meant to be ""decieving."" ""Pasiones"" is a wonderful mix of languages and I enjoy the contrast between songs about the War and songs that were sung by the soldiers. This is a really wonderful CD."
1,American folk group sing some Spanish Civil War songs,"The title ""Songs of the Spanish Civil War 1936-1939"" is deceptive and deceiving.Several songs in the album seems to be, at best, ABOUT the war. Others (6, 18) were written by English/American including music by Michael Smith, the performer. Hardly a Spanish song or lyrics.Rozhinkes mit Mandlen (20), is to the best of my knowledge an Eastern European (Jewish?) song. I wonder about its relevance to Spain.Worst of all, all the songs are performed a'la the great American folk style of the 60'. I was looking for Spanish songs with Spanish flavor and rhythm not to Peter, Paul & Mary."
1,This doesn't work,I bought 2 of these rumble packs and neither of them work. I have tried them in several different games and they only worked in one and then only on and off. It would be a great price if they worked but I feel like I just wasted my money. My advice is to pay a few dollars more and buy something that will work.
1,Does not work with nfl2k and nba2k!,This nyko jump pack sucks it will not work with nfl2k or nba2k. It works great in sonic. Just pick up the madcatz froce pack it much much better.
3,You get what ya paid for,"... this is a real bargain.... but if you really need a rumble pack go with the Mad Catz or Interact. I've tried those two and to compare it to this one, they are far superior. This rumble pack rumbles very softly and quitely.... which is pretty good. but it doesn't rumble at all. For Crazy Taxi it would rumble a bit and stop for a few seconds and then start rumbling again... so you get a unconstant rumbling. For San Fran 2049 it can't even be used for that game. it doesn't detect or use that rumble pak.So I don't think this rumble pak is compatible with all games... but it is very light so that's a plus. 3.5 out of 5.... but... it's a bargain."
1,This doesn't work right,This doesn't work right with nba2k and nfl2k do not git it get a madcaz one it works I have 2 thay r good
1,I must have missed it,"Other reviewers have given the plot, so I'll skip that part. I watched this and don't understand what the excitement is about. Bergman is a prop here, with very little actual camera time. There is about 5 seconds of tension, and when the tense moments are resolved (the scene could have lasted longer), the ending becomes clear. Too predictable for me."
1,No Light Relief,"The product is totally inferior to what I was expecting and advertised. I returned the item and asked for a refund. Hard to find someone to communicate with satisfactorily. When finally I got the money, it was substantially less than the money I paid for! Nobody cared to give me the explanation. All my emails went unanswered! I am terribly dissatisfied with this product, the company, and the service."
2,womans life in colonial days,"This book is a photocopied volume of an out of print book. There are no chapter headings and the text is garbled in several places and runs together with inserts that are intrusive. The information is there, but it takes more concentration to glean it than in a normal format. Carol Warburton"
4,This book may not be for everyone.,"The book was very interesting from a woman's point of view. There were things that I never knew. For example, I always assumed that women were the meek and unrespected sex of the colonial period, when in fact they were well respected. I did think that there were too many diary entries."
1,Womeans Life in Colonial Days- free Kindle Book,Didn't like the book so I couldn't finish it. I can't tell u what I thought of it since I didn't finish reading it. To me the book didn't make a whole lot of sense.
4,Very pleased,A nice set of box and open end wrenches - excellent price good quality.Allows for a proper size wrench to use on any project encountered around the home.
2,Does not work as advertised,In theory this looks so easy to use. I bought it with very high expectations. I have tried to use it twice now and it certainly does not work as described in the instructions. The water turns blue within a couple of minutes and all the granules in the sprayer disappear within the first 5 mins. The instructions say that if the container only has blue water without granules that means you need a refill of the fertilizer. I would stay away from this. It was a waste of money for me.
1,Only Lasted about Three Uses,"The product didn't mix well in the reservoir,so I shook it up, and kept spraying. I knew it wasn't applying evenly, but that was okay. Miracle-Gro doesn't burn my plants if I get a little too much on one or the other. But then the sprayer started leaking on the second use. I made sure I had the thing closed correctly and on right, but it leaked. And then the plastic switch on top where you switch from just water to water and fertilizer mix, completely quit working. I wasn't mis-using it or switching it back and forth a lot, just watered some after the fertilizer was gone, so the whole garden would be watered. Small garden. I was very disappointed, since I'd stocked up on Miracle-Gro for plants, tomatoes, etc. I love how easily it mixes and that it doesn't burn plants, but I'm afraid to try another sprayer.Does anyone know if I can just buy another sprayer/applicator and use it with Miracle-Gro?Thanks!"
3,OLD MODEL WAS BETTER,"The older model was better in that it mixes the fertilizer better. This newer model has better functions (various spray, lock spray, handle) but doesn't really mix well. The trick is to (1) fill it up with water with miracle-gro in it prior to use, and (2) occasionally turning unit upside down while using it to force better mix, and (3) stop spraying to allow water to mix inside container and then resume spraying for around 10-secs (repeat). This beats using water cans although I still use water cans for some hung plants."
1,Miracle-Gro 100410 lawn and garden feeder,"Good idea but poorly made. I followed instructions and hooked the feeder to my garden hose using city water. All was good till I let go of the trigger, then water leaked badly from the handle and trigger area. It became useless at that point. Will need to take back for a refund. Why should any product fail on the first use..... it shouldn't. Stick with the liquid feeder it seems to work better."
1,Doesn't work,The connection between the hose and the sprayer seems to be missing a part or something. There's no washer and there is an obvious path for water to escape. It leaks like crazy. Only recommended if it is hot outside and you want to get sprayed while fertilizing your plants.
1,junk,This contraption does not mix the miracle gro evenly. Why they put their name on something like this is beyond me
1,The old one worked well.,"The miracle gro product is great, especially in an arid area with little rain to activate a granule product, but the new feeder design is pathetic. When I FINALLY got it working properly, it dribbled constantly during and in between use. I checked all washers and retightened everything to no avail. The trigger has to be contantly depressed during use, and you have to squeeze AS HARD AS YOU CAN, regardless of the water pressure. It was exhausting. Do they bother to beta test these things? The old one dribbled a little if it tipped over, but otherwise was fine. It also had one switch and stayed on without having to constantly apply pressure. I'd still be using it if the container hadn't blown away in a wind storm."
2,Too hard to handle,I much prefer the Miracle Gro 'pellets' as this contraption is too hard to handle while dragging a hose to all parts of the garden.
1,Very poor idea,I have used the old Model #100409 garden feeder and was pleased. I used the old feeder with it's hose to hose connection. This way I could water my lawn when it was hot and dry. I cannot stand for two hours watering my large back yard with an end hose feeder.
1,... LOOK HERE FOR THE ANSWER !!!,"OK, folks, the Miracle-Gro Lawn feeder doesn't work. Miracle-Gro makes GREAT plant foods -- but they just can't make feeders that work worth a darn. So, this is what you have to do. Step one .. don't buy it. Step two .. buy an ORTHO Dial 'N Spray Multi-Use Hose-End Sprayer. I've got two of 'em. One for weed killer, and one for Miracle Gro stuff. Pour your Miracle Gro lawn food (one packet) into the Ortho Dial Sprayer. Fill it with water. Stir with a spoon (one that you will use permanently with this sprayer) Put the lid (top) back on. Set the dial to 2 and 1/2, then hook it up to your hose and blast away.When the blue water in your container is all gone, you're done. No guessing; no turning upside down; no wondering ... period. YOU MUST CLEAN IT OUT WHEN YOU'RE DONE OR IT WILL BE HISTORY AFTER ONE USE. It takes two minutes. And that's how it's done, folks. It really works -- good !!! Now, JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO IT !!!!"
1,Junk,I just got done using this thing and it didn't even work as expected. It takes FOREVER for it to fill with water. Then it seemed to never spray out the lawn fertilizer. I had to basically tilt the ting upside down and on its side for the water to even turn blue. NEVER AGAIN. Scotts - Please revamp this for next season. This thing is JUNK!
1,Junk,"This is a great idea. Too bad it's a peice of junk. I didn't like how inexact the feeding was since you never knew how much was left in there, especially after storing it for a while. I could have lived with that, though. What I couldn't live with was the fact that after three uses, water exploded from every available orifice. Junk."
1,new junk,on my old one could take front nozzle off and plug inbetwen hose's and feed entire garden.not on this piece of crap.and will not melt powder evenly.they screwed up a good thing
1,I have three of these things--none of which work.,"I am an old lady who doesn't throw anything away, thinking I might need it some day. Over the years, I've purchased three of Stern's sprayers, with high hopes that the newest one will finally work. Forget it. I'm finally dumping my hope and throwing them out. It's hard to believe that a functional one hasn't been designed."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I'd give this zero stars if possible. First, it leaks like a sieve after just a few (single digit) hours of use... as in 20% of the water lands on my foot. (And no, the leak isn't from where the hose mates to the sprayer). Secondly, it is hard to get a consistent rate of feed from the fertilizer. The first half is gone after a minute, and the second half takes an hour to disappear. Avoid it... enough said."
1,doesn't connect to my hose,i bought this from a local store and when i tried connecting it to 2 different hoses it didn't connect.Buy Miracle-Gro Shake and Feed instead it's so much better.
1,What happened Scott People?,"I used to have the old model feeder, an I loved it When that one got old ,and clogged I decided time for a new and improved one. BOY!!!! was I surprised when all I got was wet blue feet, becaused the thing leaked all over, feet, hands, grass. almost every place but where I wanted it to go.Shame,on you people. Don't you test your products. you ought to be reimbursing everyone who bought one."
1,Product sucks,"Product is cheaply made. The canister does not make a good seal, one leak. Then there are other leak issues at the hose connection. Good luck if you buy one sucker..."
2,"It Works, However....","Installed this and two new drives and was quite happy with the new disk space available. However after a while I noticed that my system speed had been reduced considerably. After troubleshooting and removing the card from my system, everything was back up to speed. It works but at a price."
4,A great find for Lynch fans,"A bit raw, but great for Lynch fans. First story is typical Lynch weirdness, with vague implications, and typical funny, wacky characters. The second story is surprisingly very 'normal', quite funny... and very 'Sex in the City'... in the 1990's. Can't say it was my favorite. Maybe that's because it wasn't directed by Lynch. The third and final set was a great, simple story about loss and forgiveness, depicted in typical Lynchian style. Crispin Glover and Alicia Witt deliver very simple but excellent performances. All in all, if you're a Lynch fan, Hotel Room is definitely worth seeing. If not, then you probably don't need to bother..."
4,"Not a healthy relationship to be found, but illness to amuse","This is an arrangement of scenes between men and women that displays a complex mess of cynicism and childish vulnerability. John Irving might appreciate how it wrings a twisted amusement out of you. Laughing at insanity, knowing possibly it's seed is squirrelled away inside you, is an interesting sensation. Which is why some people laugh at 'South Park' and 'The Simpsons' too. A great date movie. <end sarcasm>"
5,"THE BEST BOOKS MAKE YOU SMILE, CRY AND READ ON!",THIS BOOK KEPT ME READING RIGHT THROUGH AT ONE SITING TO THE END. I CONSIDER IT A BEST BOOK! HOPEFULLY MS KRUESI WILL DO IT AGAIN!
3,Charming & Whimsical,"The premise - Peter Pan really lives, the plot and the theme have promise. What could be better than a modern, whimsical, fairy tale? However the author fails to totally deliver with real characters and plot. Not bad - but not a keepr."
4,Great Read!,"This text refreshingly covered a wider array of topics than I expected. As a Nonprofit Management major in college, this greatly helped me prepare for relevant course work."
3,Required Reading,This particular book was required reading for a graduate course of mine. I wouldn't suggest it as a great read; only if you're trying to utilize a section for a course.
3,This Propeller Doesn't Fit a C2-30 Minn Kota !,"""This propeller (MKP-6) is suppose to fit a C2-30 Minn Kota Motor but it is too large fit into the motor housing as it should. I replaced my broken Minn Kota propeller with a MKP-2 which fits and works perfectly. I spent four hours on the lake yesterday enjoying my new MKP-2 propeller and it operated flawlessly. The MKP-2 fits and was made for use with this motor; weeds have never been a problem with the MKP-2."""
2,Bad sound quality,"I just purchased this CD via digital download, listened to the tracks, and the quality is BAD!It sounds like the mp3's were digitized using a turntable with a dirty needle! Or when the mp3 file was created that clipping occurred.As this date that I posting this review, DO NOT BUY these mp3s unless you want to hear cracks and pops!The tracks themsevles are good music, but the sound quality sucks!"
2,Doesn't even hold a two-year-old's interest,"I thought my 2-year-old daughter would love this toy when she got it for her birthday, since she loves anything that she can play with in the water. However, there really isn't much you can do with this; there are no moving parts, and only one way for the pieces to fit together. Another point against it is that you can't see the diver's face very well. This made her lose interest quickly. On top of everything, it leaks! My little girl still insists on having it in the bathtub with her (she has to have ALL her bath toys with her every time), so it slowly sinks to the bottom of the tub during every bath, and after every bath I empty the water out of the submarine. I haven't thrown it away because it was a gift, but I'm losing patience with this toy."
5,Excellent play rug,"My grandson(3 years old)loves this rug. He is big into farming and it is a wonderful place for him to set up his tractors, animals, fences etc. We have hardwood floors and this rug stays in place and does not slide around on the floor. He can roll the rug up (sort of) and put it away at the end of playtime. Farm equipment is easy to gather up because it is on the rug and not zoomed under the furniture. Colors are bright and cheerful does not show dirt and with a very active 3 year old boy that is an important feature! Would totally recommend this play rug."
2,Lazy reproduction of an old book.,"Maybe this book is out of copyright or something... but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing. It's actually a copy of the pages - not even fit right to the book's size. They didn't bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system, so you're basically paying for a very rough, poorly scaled photocopy of the old printing. No wonder it's not available on Kindle."
3,history suspect -- book free on Project Gutenberg,"This book was written in the 1930s. If you're a serious historian, I'd recommend finding some newer scholarship. Very sensationalized. You can down load it for nothing from Project Gutenberg."
4,old school female rap pioneers,I agree with j arce (puertorocreppin) the ladies of oaktown's 357 never truly got the respect they deserved. I was and still am a huge fan of this group and was very excited when i found out they finally released all their hit videos (along with their remastered hit cds) They come from an era when hip hop wasn't all about violence/hate. (which few people under 30 will understand) you see back then it was all about the party. True they didn't have the tightest lyrics but at the same time they still held their own and definetely put on a show. There are a more than a few club bangers on this dics and this cd is a must buy to add to any old school hip hop head's list.
4,One video missing from the DVD,Chad one of the other reviewers is half wrong about the DVD.The Turn It Up video is not on it.That's why I'm giving it 4 stars.
4,"Hot ,Sexy,and Black in 89!","I previously had seen Oaktown's 3.5.7 ""3-5-7 straight at you"" on Vh1 soul and it was a great video.The dances, The girl's and the rhymes were great!. As a young black old-school hip hop fan I LOVED THESE GIRLS and their song was a hit.If anyone out there has any info on these girl's ...please keep me posted.Until Then...peace!"
5,Generational Dirty Laundry,"Wow! This mesmerizing tale of South Carolina - flashing between 1966 and now is taut and disturbing and compelled me to make a new List: SLEEP? Who Needs SLEEP? Page turners - all night long.It's a ""Who Dunnit"" and a ""Why Dunnit"" and yet a well-crafted cousin to both ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""A Time to Kill."" Don't waste any more time reading these reviews. Rush your little cursor right up there to that ""Add to ShoppingCart"" button and get it now, ya hear?! Reviewed by TundraVision"
5,Captivating!,"It took me two days to read this book, only because I was working and busy with my 8-year-old. The plot twists were unexpected; everytime I thought I knew what would happen next I found myself sent in another direction. The only disappointments were Brittany and Yvette: Brittany is way too young to be that articulate, and even though she was afraid of Jack she probably would not have been old enough to know to try to hide in the fireplace. It also would have been nice to see what happens to Yvette once her meds were weaned. Overall I loved the book and would definitely read more from this author."
1,Racism in reverse?,"Sad,sad book. Although raised in NYC,I lived in both North and South Carolina during the 1960's and agree there was racism....but this pushes the limits of reality. White people in power (in the clan of course) are all mean and stupid and kill little black children. Shame on the author."
2,This figure is not meant to be played with,"Super tough looking batman figure. Best purpose -- for the collector who leaves it in the box. My son loves to play batman. Unfortunately, the first one only lasted about two days and the figure broke at the knees. So of course, we had to buy a replacement. The second one lasted less than an hour and it broke at the same place as the first one, right at the knees, where the shields are. Highly recommend for adult collectors only, unless you want to repeatidly keep buying replacements for crying children."
4,Minn Kota Deckhand 25 Electric Anchor Winch Installation,I bought two of these. One for the bow and one for the stern. The one for the bow I had to drill new holes in the mounting bracket in order for it to fit. The stern will take some major work to adapt it and I haven't installed it yet. The one I do have installed works fine though.
1,Trouble,"We have trouble with the electric anchor, The cord tends to backlash and ties itself all around the wheel. so far it has been a battle. Nothing like we expected. If I could I would return it. Great idea not such a great thing."
3,Copyright Is More Than Just About Profit,"This book does not really explore aspects of copy protection beyond profit. Copy protection's original purpose was to protect others from taking your intellectual work and pretending to be theirs without giving the original authors any credit. So yes, copyright protection is indeed important, as it encourages creativity when implemented properly."
2,Boring,"The problem with this book, is that you cannot argue for copyrights on one hand, and against them on the other. Either there is intellectual property or there is not. If there is not, then it is a government granted monopoly, and government granted monopolies can be shown to be less efficient then the market. As such, this means that copyrights would not do a better job at encouraging ingenuity. The thing is the book seems to talk about the philosophy of it a lot more then the reality of it."
5,Entertaining and Informative,"I read this book as part of my research for a paper on the history of copyright policy. I found Vaidhyanathan to be both well-informed and a good writer. Unlike many resources on this topic, Copyrights and Copywrongs was quite interesting to read. Vaidhyanathan's book is both insightful and entertaining. If you've ever wondered how in the world something like Copyright policy could be interesting or relevant, you should pick up this book. Once you do, you'll almost certainly keep reading until you've reached the end. If you want to learn about the history of Copyright policy and how it affects you, you should definitely read this book. ..."
4,Orson Welles Movie,"A rare look inside Belgium movie making in the early 1970's. The movie is a mixture of Fairytale & Horror, with Orson Welles primarily in the first 30 minutes of the film. Susan Hampshire is a fantastic actress playing four different roles in the same movie (you will not recognize her in her different characters). The DVD box contained a glossy sixteen page booklet, and Bonus Features on two DVDs. I would recommend this DVD movie to anyone who is a fan of Orson Welles."
5,Unicornis: on the History and Truth of the Unicorn,"Defanitly one of the best books That I have ever had the pleasure of inturpretting.Filled with Images of visual mastery, yet, langauge as vibrant as the origanal Unicorn Manuscript itself. Personaly, I beleve that the Prophecy states the horn is hidden some where in the rocky mountains. If at any point in time, you have any possibility of receving Unicornis: on the History and Truth of the Unicorn, I suggest you take the Oppertunity.Chris Snead"
4,"Excellent Selection, wish there was more!","This book brings together short stories by largely canonical American authors--people we all read in school such as Hawthorne, Poe, and Melville. What Franklin has done brilliantly is shown, by the way he has collected the stories, how much they share a developing science fiction sensibility. Franklin also offers introductions to the stories and authors that are well written and intelligent, but here is also the source of my only complaint: I wish the introductions were slightly shorter, leaving room to include a few more stories. Still, this is an excellent anthology, one that will interest both converted science fiction fans and those who restrict themselves to reading that counts as ""virtuous."""
4,For those with an interest in Philippine or World Music,"This album presents an impeccable recording and beautiful instrumentation and some very pleasant vocals. Like the country itself, the music represents a mix of the hispanic, asian and malayo-polynesian sensibilities. For those who have a deeper interest in Philippine culture, this is a must-get. But also for those who love authentic musics of the world, check this out. You won't be disappointed."
2,Misleading title,"The title of this CD is misleading because what is supposed to be kulintang music, entitled Ka-singkil, Vinta, Tahing-Baila, Malong - dance accompaniment for Southern Mindanao dances are not the authentic kulintang music as played by the indigenous peoples of this region. Likewise with Dinuya - dance of the Mountain Province indigenous people. These pieces in this recording are percussion instrumentation as performed by the Bayanihan Dance Company quite different from the traditional percussion (kulintang and gangsa) music of the indigenous tribes."
1,Really?,"I thought that this was the song written by Regina Spector because after purchasing one song from her, amazon linked me to this one. I completely regrett that I purchased it on accident. I couldn't even listen through the whole thing. Ten seconds was enough for me to decide that it lacks creativity, sounds straight up annoying and is thus total and utter crap. I would have given it zero stars but, amazon made me put at least one. If you are reading this don't accidentally buy or even buy it on purpose. This song shouldn't exist."
4,Awsome!,"Brazilian movies can be real good, this one is not an exemption. Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas made an intelligent and exeptional movie. Just don't know why it was produced in black and white. Watch ""Central Station"" as well, you won't be disappointed. By the way: the song in the end of the movie is called ""Vapor Barato"" (cheap vapor) by Gal Costa."
5,Jamie O'Reilly goes deeper,"Jamie O'Reilly's new cd is a complete listening pleasure for any Sunday afternoon. I found myself humming ""The Riddle Song"" and singing along to the standard ballad ""Annie Laurie"". Michael Smith's ""The Snow Queen"" excerpts and the token ""Waving to Picasso"" from their show ""Hello: Dali"" left me wanting to hear more. I could listen to Jamie sing all day. Although she bills herself as an alto on this recording, it is her crystal clear, warm high notes that tug at my heart strings everytime."
4,Relieved the fifth season was finally released!,"I had bought all the DVDs up to season 4 and was dissapointed that they stopped issuing the seasons. All in al, the features are the same as the other seasons and the dvd's are a must have for any fresh prince fan!"
5,Fresh Prince Will,I love the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and was happy to add to my collection season 5. I will look to add season 6 soon.
3,Overall good,"Honestly, I bought this album because of one or two tracks I liked in particular. Namely ""Walter.""Rest of the album, while certainly nice on their own, seem a bit repetitive when played straight through.Nice work, though."
1,Picture Looks Much Better Than Product,"If I had opened the box before I gave the Club Champ Putt 'n Return Putting Mat as a gift, I would have returned it. Disappointed in the quality and durabiity. Would not recommend."
2,Disappointed,"Although the subject matter was interesting, the lack of pictures and overall layout of the book made it tedious to read. I saw so many opportunities for this book to be better. For example, there were many instances where an accompanying picture would have clarified a description or put it into a better context. A specific example of this is where she mentions a nail belt. It would have been illuminating to see a picture of one on that page. The writing style to me seemed dry, almost ""textbook""."
2,"Decent ""starter"" book","Without reiterating the commentary from the five previous reviewers (all of whom I happen to agree with), I will only add that The Habit makes a decent primer for those who are new to the subject of women's clerical garb. It's a fast read and fairly interesting, but it really isn't worth the new hardcover price. Look for a used copy."
1,A Pastiche of Other's Work,"Save your money on this one. From an average introduction, things went steadily downhill. If there was any original research in this book, it could not be found. Pictures were dated and can be found elsewhere in several other sources. All were all full body shots with little or no detail. Perhaps strangest was the Glossary of Church Terms, few if any were used in the body of the text. What that had to do with the main topic is still a mystery. About the only redeeming feature is it is an example of ""pastiche."""
4,Hit the spot,I have always had a curiosity about nuns which would include their habits and this book was the only one I was able to find that helped break it down.Thanks!
2,Disappointing,"This is a fascinating subject, but Kuhns makes too many mistakes in areas I'm familiar with for me to trust there are none in areas I'm not. Her discussion of pagan culture is muddled; she collapses together customs of different centuries as if all pagans of all places and times were interchangeable. The book also shows signs of having been spell-checked by computer."
1,that's not even a nun on the cover,"The habit depicted on the cover of this book is that of a Daughter of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, before 1964. They do not identify themselves as nuns, since they do not take perpetual vows. They are ""sisters."" What a blunder!"
2,Not all 5 episodes!,"Why the description mentions the 5 episodes when, for some reason, you only actually get 1 with each genre of tour (and you don't get to choose which one), I am not sure. $2.99 for 24 minutes of view time is ridiculous. I hope it is a glitch and that it gets fixed because it is a super silly problem."
3,Colourisation Terrible,This is a wonderful story and a lovely movie for the family. However I would have purchased the b&w version over this. They did a rotten job with the colours. Most of the cast's lips (except the women) are the same colour as their face (flesh-coloured) which makes it look as if they don't have lips at all! This is particularly evident with the Butler & Heidi. If you can deal with this annoyance go ahead and buy the film. Otherwise look for the black & white.
2,What a shame...,"I've waited so long for one of my all time favorite films to come out on DVD and was really disapointed. The colorized version is laughable and the Black and white version is grainy and in bad need of restoration. If it weren't for Shirley Temple there would be no Fox Studios, so come on guys before you release her other films, do it right!"
5,A great classic!,This a wonderful classic that is worth watching during the holidays! A child and her grandfather develope a wonderful loving bond. A refreshing family movie!
3,"Great movie, bad DVD.","""Heidi"" is one of my favourite Shirley Temple movies, so I was thrilled when it was released on DVD. But after playing it, I'm not happy.I can't stand the colourized versions, so I was excited to find that the DVD included the black and white version as well. However, the quality of the black and white version is so poor, I suspect they may have just ""un-colourized"" the colour version and tried to pass it off as the original black and white.In this day and age, there is no excuse for the picture quality of a DVD to be this bad. You would also think that there would be a better process for colourizing by now. There is a black and white VHS edition of this movie that I am considering buying for my collection... I really would have preferred a DVD, but this release is just not good enough."
2,Americanized version of a Swiss story,"I was pretty disappointed when I saw this movie. I have read the book, seen quite a few Heidi movies, but this one is not close to the book. The first part is ok, but the second part is totally made up.Chasings, prison, Fr. Rottenmeier is very evil and ( spoiler)tries to sell Heidi, etc.If you look for a Heidi movie that portaits the book, don't get this one. If you want a movie about Shirley Temple, this one is fine then. Being from Germany, this one dissapointed me. My favorite Heidi movie is the 1956 w/ Elsbeth Sigmund. It has a few changes from the book, but in generell is close to it and also gives you a feel of the time and place where Heidi would have lived."
1,Miserable mis-rendering!,"As one who finds Johanna Spyri's ""Heidi"" to be one of the best children's books, I find this transition to melodrama dreadful, and totally untrue to the book's text. The independent Heidi, whose warmth and faith are such that she is fearless and completely kind, is reduced to a picture book moppet. Worse yet, characters such as Dete and Fraulein Rottenmeir, who, in the book, are respectively rather self-centred and puzzled at the lower class child, are depicted as totally wicked - ready to sell Heidi to the gypsies! Clara, who in the original is disabled more because of her elders' fear and over-protectiveness than because of her unnamed illness, now is the target of a wicked governess who has a financial interest in keeping her ill and weak.This dreadful film is suited only to those who are die hard fans of Shirley Temple."
5,great kids movie!,"After being totally dissapointed by the Emma Bolger version of Heidi, I purchased this one. It was beautiful. Sweet, innocent, funny, even a little sad. All the characters did an excellant job. Children don't need high paced drama to be impressed. They giggled and wiggled over parts such as Heidi milking the goat, the monkeying around, and the sleigh chase near the end. And don't forget Andrew trying to milk ""Bearly"" either! I am a mother with six children. We all loved this movie. I would recomend it to anyone who wants a bit of innocent entertainment."
4,Heidi,"It had been many years since I had last seen this classic. It is a wonderful movie for any age. I thought I had remembered it a certain way and then when I saw it again, it was like I was watching it for the first time. What a difference watching it as a senior than when I was a child. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,"""The Story of a Grandfather and Grandaughter""","Heidi is an excellent film, of course starring Shirley Temple as the witty Heidi, about a young orphaned girl who is sent away by her mean aunt to live with her strict and stern, but loveable, grandfather in the Alps. The film consists of many hilarious moments, like when Heidi is learning to milk a goat and when she tries to yodel in the village. My favorite scene is when Heidi asks her Grandfather to tell her a story. He reads her a story about a little Dutch girl with a pair of wooden shoes. The story comes alive and Shirley plays the little Dutch girl. The movie is excellent for young children and for people who loved the novel, to me, the picture is much better. The scenery is spectacular for being a 1937 film and the costume designs bring you into the time of Heidi. No Shirley Temple collection is complete without Heidi!"
5,Best version of Heidi,I think all young people should see this movie as it is a classic. Shirley Temple played Heidi as no other actress has been able to.
5,Great family movie,Shirley Temple is great in this movie and it is a wonderful family movie about how love can warm a heart. This movie is in black and white which is good but would have been better in color.
5,"Ah, Shirley Temple!","What a beautiful little story! My girls LOVED it, and I really appreciated the G rating. Definitely a must-see for the whole family!"
5,excellent,Best movie ever always loved it i recommend it to others a true classic upgrade to dvd for best view
2,Heidi,"Heidi is a wonderful story. Although I love Shirley Temple movies, I was disappointed that this movie did not follow the story line of the book but added unnecessary plot line. I would not let my younger grandchildren watch this adaptation of Heidi. The cover may be color but the movie is B & W"
5,Heidi,"This movie use to be shown at Christmas every year thats were i remember it from....its a pity they don't show it any more,I think the kids would really enjoy it."
5,Excellent Photography book,This informative book about Kern County is filled with beautiful photographs of the four seasons. They are identified by season in a colorful map featured in the front of the book. This central California book should be viewed by anyone interested in the scenic beauty of California.
1,Don't buy unless.............,"If you like peeing blood, go ahead and buy these. Seriously, I would have to say race only. On the street they are horrible, I am on here to buy Pro springs to replace."
3,Mixed feelings...,"It's a gorgeous skillet and the bottom is larger than other 12"" skillets I've seen or used. You can easily cook several servings at once. Unlike the 3-ply competitors, this has a thick aluminum/copper bottom. Unfortunately, this takes forever to heat up or to respond to gas changes. Combined with a skinny handle, it is very bottom-heavy and not well balanced--difficult to handle, especially when wet. Mirror finish exterior is easy to clean, but the copper bottom will look ratty unless you make effort to polish it. Finally, the stainless interior is of the stick variety. I'm surprised to see the review that says it can be used for stir-frying. It's way too shallow. Use a wok. Overall, it is a nice looking pan that is generously sized, but not as easy to use as I expected."
5,Eighteenth century epic.,A captivating tale of war and love in an eighteenth century setting during the war between England and France. A charming swashbucklimg hero that continually survives impossible odds such as those Hollywood film-makers love. Have fun!
4,My 4 year old loves it.,It's an old Snoopy book from my childhood. My 4 year old son loves it. We only wish that Charles Schulz would have written more like it. We keep wondering when and if Snoopy ever will get that Red Baron.
3,On the fence,"A travel companion raved to me about this makeup and I had to try it. Basically, I like the feel of this makeup. It's really soft and it feels nice when I am wearing it. It's also long lasting which is also really nice. My biggest issue with this foundation is the color. I have really ivory/fair skin and in certain lighting it appears orange. I also bought the lightest shade which is Ivory. If this foundation matched my skin color I would consider buying it again, but the price to way too high."
1,Sketches by Boz as read by Anais 9000,Imagine one of the funniest and saddest collection of short stories by one of the greatest writers in the English language read by an vocally affectless female computer. Absolutely the worst thing ever foisted on an unwary public. Not worth spending a dime on. Pass it by friend.Sketches By Boz
1,Lacks useful information.,"I recieved more useful information from a pamplet my bank sent to me than from this book. This book rambles on about how good credit affects you and why it's important to have good credit. The useful information is simply repeating what most people already know - That you can write your credit agency, and for a fee get a copy of your report, and you can write them a letter disputing what's in your report. It does not give any real depth to help you straiten out your credit."
5,great show,gritty realistic and severe. I wish this was the only show on T V because there is notihg lie it and it is well acted and great story line. very real.
5,awesome,Ive watched this show from the beginning. This show is laugh out loud funny. You can really relate to the characters and if not you just enjoy the story.
5,Love It,This is is most messed up family I have ever encountered. Entertainment to the Max. Shameless is a must see.
5,Totally GREAT,"I can't wait until season two comes out on DVD. Shameless is totally different and fantastically written, directed and the actors superbly cast. If it continues with this great ensemble, it will last season after season for years."
5,very funny,"This series has some really funny skits and some parts of it are really hard to take if your at all sensitive to the human condition.My wife is a social worker and had a hard time with some of the dialog, but we still recommend the show to our friends. The writing is probably some of the best on TV and the acting is truly wonderful, the whole cast makes the series real."
5,Great show! Fun to watch!,"I love love love this show! The characters are so well written play out great. Nothing clean about this humor though folks, so if you are looking for a show to watch with the family, try something else."
4,Totally Shameless,"I am sometimes horrified that I enjoy this series so much. I think the writers/producers would enjoy hearing that, as they love to go for the shock value. Sometimes, it goes over the top. I have seen things I did not want to see, but I can't stop watching.Seriously, this series will never be for everyone. I'm never gonna say, ""Hey grandma, come over and lets watch Shameless."" I worry that in showing the gritty truth of these people, they will somehow glorify them. No one wants their kid to grow up and be a Gallagher (except maybe Emmy Rossum's Fiona, has there ever been a better film depiction of youth being derailed by responsibility?) Yet despite it all, I like these people, and I wish for them (in the last, final episode someday) a redemption that God or scriptwriters seldom give."
5,Great show!,"This is one of the best shows ever. It's irreverent, funny, outrageous and makes me laugh more than any show that I can remember."
1,SHAMELESS: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON,i'm STILL waiting to receive it since Xmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't seem to track it and don't know who to send an email to????????????can you help track this down????????????
1,"""Edgy"" for the sake of edgy","I get that pay cable shows can show whatever they want, but with ""shameless"" they're just doing it because they can. It's a COMPLETELY inaccurate portrayal of 95% of the residents of the south side of Chicago and they commonly mistake normal Chicago landmarks. It seems as if it's a show made by people from California who have no clue about what Chicago is like.p.s. I call bulls***on ANY girl who looks like Emmy Rossum shoveling s***for a living. It just doesn't happen. I don't care how poor they supposedly are."
4,Crazy but good!,Watching this insanely disfunctional family makes one feel good about their own life. The show quickly grew onme and became addictive.
4,More Reference Than Workbook,"An unusual but excellent text. The author conducts a point by point review of grammar rules while also introducing a news and media-oriented selection of related vocabulary items in each chapter. The grammar overview is very concise, written in as non-technical a manner as possible and can be described as pithy. John Mace has a wonderful way of distilling rules simply and clearly. He also narrows the grammar down to the most useful subset possible. Although short exercises punctuate the text, the book is more a review than a workbook."
5,Sweet !!!,This movie is completely useless to any normal person! I lost whatever brain cells I have left watching it then couldn't find my way home from the movie theater! This is a masterpiece that would have Siskel holding 2 thumbs up from below. A must for the whole family.
1,"Dude, I Hate This Movie!","One of the worst films ever made. Seriously, dude!Ashton Kutcher from That '70s Show and Seann Wiliam Scott from American Pie. The show and movie are wastelands. No talent whatsoever. I contrast this with the classic Dazed and Confused which is a gold mine of talent, even the people in minor roles.So these two guys awake to find that they had such a good time they forgot the previous night. They also can't find their car. A lot of talk about ""shibby."" This is a shameless poseur stoner comedy. Dude, how's that for adjectives?As for the space aliens, Ed Wood did it better in Plan 9 From Outer Space."
4,Good silly fun,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"" opens with ""stoners"" Jesse and Chester (played by Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott) waking up to find Jesse's car missing (hence the film's title). But the boys have no memory of the night before, and thus must solve the mystery of the missing vehicle. Their first clue involves. . . pudding.""Dude,"" directed by Danny Leiner, is a whimsical blend of mystery, comedy, and science fiction. It's full of absurd characters and ridiculous situations, and is shot with real visual flair. The comedy is very much enhanced by the easygoing likeability of and solid ""buddy"" chemistry between Kutcher and Scott. They are well backed by a good supporting cast; along the way are some quirky and very enjoyable cameo spots.The DVD offers a feature length commentary by director Leiner and costars Kutcher and Scott. Their three-way verbal interplay is hilarious and very informative; if you already enjoy this film I highly recommend watching it with this commentary."
1,What a stinker,"How did this piece of junk ever get made? Granted, I'm not a teenager, but I hope that even teenagers have brains enough to recognize a dog when they see one! The only reason I viewed this film is because of the previews, they were pretty comical. But three or four scenes don't make a movie. What's wrong with screen writers these days? Whoever wrote this must have been related to some one in upper management, otherwise it would have never been produced. The writer should have smoked the script, it would have saved us all some money."
4,"Dumb & Bumber, Part 2.","I'm a huge, HUGE fan of Dumb adn Dumber and I thought this comedy was the same thing... which it is. BUT, and this is a very big BUT... it goes off onto a weird plot about fantasy things. It kind of gets ridiculous around the 40 minute mark, but the first half is pretty funny. It's one of those movies that you really have to suspend disbelief, because it's not real what-so-ever. Although if it would have had more realism to it, it could have been a great flic.The bonus stuff is pretty good and I love the commentary that Ashton, Scott and Danny give. Great stories from the set!"
5,Incredibly Well-Written for Something so Cheesy,"Dude, Where's My Car? rocketed straight to the top of my 'favorite movies' list after the first time I saw it. A great fan of bad puns, one-liners, and just overall tacky, I found myself laughing my head off. What really struck me about this movie, though, was how well-written it was. There was not a single part of the movie that was not integral to the plot in one way or another, which is made all the more dumbfounding after seeing jokes like ""Dude, Llamas!"" ""Dude, those are ostriches."" <a while later> ""Stupid Llamas!!!!"" *l* If you love whimsical, cheesy, and just a little tacky, this is definitely the movie for you!"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Ok, ok, we all know about my affinity for Ashton Kutcher, however I don't give all his movies 5 stars. Dude, is absolutely ridiculous, stupid, pointless, basically, a classic stoner comedy. While it has no real point to it, it does have some pretty funny lines and that's what earns it 2 stars. In my opinion, the movie is nowhere near as raunchy as it has to be. Movies like this are based on cheap laughs, and when it's PG-13 without a single boob or F bomb, it's just nothing special. By the end the film, it was just totally out of control. I should have just turned it off, but I suffered through to the end. Basically this movie was the foundation for Harold & Kumar. It was ok, but just wasn't funny enough."
3,Bubblewrap at its best!!,"Of course this movie was crazy stupid, but that's exactly what it's supposed to be! Don't expect a mind-boggling script, a philosophical question, or anything that requires a brain to comprehend. This movie is just plain stupid comedy at it's ""best"". I can never look at Bubblewrap again without laughing. It's great."
3,Hilarious...But Plotless,"This film was a very random, but very funny, movie. The humor used in this film is stupid humor, which usually can be random. The two ""dudes"" are going around looking for their car afetr a night of drinking. However, they turn the search into intergalactic war. Now you see why I call it plotless. So if you want to see a movie that is very random with a lot of stupid but funny humor, then see this. But don't bother if you are looking for a movie with a plot."
1,Terrible,"Its just another hormonal teen movie centured around sex and drugs. This movie lacks intelligence, and the plot doesn't flow well.Two friends are dating, and one day on the date of the twins girlfriends birthday, they lose thier car. Thinking that the twin have some sex in store for them, they go on an adventure to find their car. Memories are lost because of the'r wild night before. While on the way, they get thrown into another stupid plot, to find a machine for a group of women who plan to give them erotic plasure if they bring it to them.My best advice is to stay away from this ignorant picture."
1,I'd rather choke on my own vomit.,"Seriously, this movie's target audience had to have been the bed wetter wing of the special needs home."
1,Too stupid to even smile at,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is just another teenie-bopper-sex comedy movies to go along with the rest of the teenie-bopper...comedies....There is no real plot. Just two morons who woke up after a...night before (where many teenie-boppers will laugh at) and they can't find their car. And they are to stupid to even know what happened. This movie was made to draw in teenie-boppers, and it succeeded. But smart people who toally despise the teenie-bopper era, like myself, will stay away from this..."
2,Dumb comedy that falls flat.,"I went into this movie that it was going to be stupid. But I didn't even find it funny. Sure there are some scenes that make you laugh, but its cause they are so pathetic. The acting was terrible all around, and the story made no sense what so ever. This is just a bad movie with a cool title."
1,"Dude, did the writers write a good script? NO WAY DUDE!!","Dude, Where's My Car? (2000) Ashton Kutcher, Seann William Scott, Jennifer Garner, Marla Sokoloff, Kristy Swanson, David Herman, Hal Sparks, Charlie O' Connell, D: Danny Leiner.Juvenile comedy about two pothead morons waking up in the morning with hangovers to find they misplaced their car and try to recap the wild events of the night before.Lowbrow and witless, with goofballs named Jesse and Chester, in the tradition of Bill and Ted, or Cheech and Chong, or Harry and Lloyd. Yes, teenagers will find appeal in this, and it can be entertaining if your idea for a Saturday evening is a waste of time.TRIVIA: Andy Dick and Brent Spiner appear unbilled. Followed by SERIOUSLY DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?Running Time: 83 minutes and rated PG-13 for language, drug content and sexual humor"
1,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"This movie is bad! There is so much to say about why it is bad, I do not even know where to start. First, There is really no plot! NONE! The acting In this film is also awful! The script, Awful! Everything, awful!. I am so glad I rented this, and did not buy it without seeing it! I gave this movie 1 star, but it really doesn't even deserve that! This film only has one good thing going for it, an Early appearance by JENNIFER GARNER. I have been a fan of hers since the 1999 TV series TIME OF YOUR LIFE. This movie should have been a short film, a very short film, then maybe it would have been entertaining. It is not short, it seems to never end. This is by far THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Don't even waste your time watching this..."
2,"Dude, What Did I Just Watch?","This movie is definitely not one of my favorites. The story, about two ""lovable"" doofuses who lose their car, get involved in a weird science fiction plot, meet up with a group of ""hot chicks"" who may be aliens and end up in a ostrich santcuary run by Brent (This is just a paycheck role for me) Spiner. I thought the Bill and Ted movie were dumb, but Dude, Where's My Car makes them look Shakespearan. The laughs were in the toilet humor vein only and the dialogue, if you could call it that, was obviously written by a middle schooler-guys saying or shouting ""Dude"" every minute is not humorous. Seann needs to change lanes with his role choices and quit playing the sex-on-the-mind idiots like in American Pie 1 and 2. Seeing Spiner in this bomb, after his brillant work as Data in Star Trek:The Next Generation, made me wince. Thank God he appears unbilled..."
1,Pathetic,"I am not going to slam this movie because it is stupid. I enjoy stupid movies quite often (Amazon even predicted that I would love the movie). But I am going to slam this movie because it was flat out not funny in the least. The guy from American Pie was brilliant in that movie because of his sarcastic wit, yet in Dude he plays a different character - a dimwitted moron, and he doesn't pull it off. Ashton Kutcher is his 70's show self and is funny but can't even come close to carrying the movie. ..."
2,Didn't find it funny.,"Love both of these actors, but this movie was not good. It was really dumb. Hope they do better in future films."
1,"Aw, don't bother","Perhaps I went into watching this movie with too high expectations. Perhaps I was still on the high that was Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Perhaps I just needed to be high. Regardless, this movie stunk. Idea is great, but the movie stunk. It consisted of semi funny jokes that went all entirely too long. ""And then?"" ""And then?"" ""And then?"" ""And then?"" ""And then?"" Yeah, we got the picture. It's not funny. I also felt like the script writers thought they were just too clever by having the characters recap the movie every 10 minutes. Like we would forget the zaniness that is a transsexual stripper trying to get her money back and Hot Chick aliens trying to get the something or other Galactic refibulator.Take my word, save your money and go see Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."
4,"Dude, Where's My Car?","dude, Where's my car is a comedy about two young adults who cant remember anything from the night before. They Have to Find there car so they can bring there girlfriends their anniversary presents, give a suitcase of money to a man who looks like a women and all in all they fnd there car, give the presents, and the money, and save the universe. It is A smoking dog, Stupididy, Killer ostriches, and kinda of (well not really) a love story, all mixed up into one big laugh."
1,Waste of time,This movie runs about one hour and fifteen minutes without closing credits. If you can't fill a movie for at least one and a half hours then don't bother charging me for it. I can't beleive the reviews for this awful movie. The laughs are very few and very far between. It is like a bad Disney channel movie. The music is totally wrong so much so that it is very annoying and very distracting.
1,One of the top ten worst movies ever!!!,"I haven't even bought the dvd, but I have seen the movie, and I felt a need to write this after reading some of the other reviews. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It ranks right up there with that Godzilla movie from a couple of years ago, which was so bad that it actually angered me. This movie was just plain embarrassing. Either the other reviewers are having a good old laugh with their comments, or they're genuinely easy to please."
3,Cheesy but fun,"This movie is over the top and rediculous, but great for a light movie and a good laugh."
3,Lookers,"Typically this is the type of movie I'd hate. And this one wasn't good, as far as the story goes. The actors: I've seen very limited a selection of their other works and I assume from this that they can't really act outside of these types of characters too well. However, I happen to own this movie, watch it regularly, and Love it. It can't be explained. There are many, many scenes worth fast-forwarding, but basically the boys are very good looking (I don't feel the same way about the ""hot chicks"", though) and make a good, convincing pair. The movie is watchable up until the end of the middle, but then it gets silly."
1,I want my 10 minutes back!!!,"I just watched the first 10 minuts of this filth, and im contemplaiting commiting suicicide. Hands down the worst, stupidest and hideously unfunny garbage. It baffles me how people get money to make vomit like this!!! I cant imagine anyone over 10 years old finding this movie entertaining!"
1,"""Dude, Where's My Brain?""","I despise this movie. I really do believe my dog's life is more interesting than this. ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" makes you wish you hadn't paid a whopping two dollars to rent it and it also makes you wonder if anyone actually likes this. Dude, a tsunami crashing down on my head would've have been more fulfilling than sitting through this movie. It really needs to go away forever and never come back."
2,"Fans of ""10 Things I Hate About You"" Won't Be Impressed","I knew that this movie wasn't going to be like 10 Things I Hate About You, but it looked really funny. I didn't expect it to be so dumb. I thought it might be as dumb as There's Something About Mary or American Pie, but this movie was really dumb, I mean really dumb. Instead of making smarter from this movie I only grew dumber, much dumber. (...)If I hadn't been I would of enjoyed the movie one bit. Yes it is enjoyable, but just make sure your brain is turned off. If you want a teen movie that will actually get some credit from critics get 10 Things I Hate About You, if you want a movie to watch when you are lazy and bored then watch this. But if your looking for another acceptable teen comedy, you won't find it here."
1,No,"The writer of this film should be killed, and every copy of it should be burned. This is by far the worst film I have ever forced myself to sit through, aside from The Blair Witch Project 2. It's horrible."
1,Worst comedy of the year,"This has got to be the worst comedy I have seen all year. I don't recall through the whole movie laughing more than once. The plot was totally idiotic. I really don't understand why these actors do these movies, I mean don't they read the scripts? This movie is so bad that I wouldn't even recommend renting it. The only reason I watched it all was because I payed PPV for it and didn't want to waste my money. Through the entire movie you just keep waiting for it to get funny but it just never does."
2,Two Stars for a Couple of Yards,"There's nothing wrong with this movie. Accept the fact that it's not a very good film.I give it two stars. There's a scene in the beginning when both boys get knocked over by old people driving cars. Old people. Driving. They can't see very well, so they knocked the kids over. There's about 1 minute of the film spent on this scene.Making fun of old people is so funny. I'm a sarcastic reviewer."
1,One star is simply two much !!!,"Don't waste your time and money!! , it's not funny (but it does makes you cry , for the owfull waste ! )and the plot , well there is no plot!!! simply , don't to buy this ""film"" ."
4,Very funny,"I really enjoyed this one. It does get a little bit long and slow, esp at the part when the Sci Fi kids kidnap our heros, and hold them for some kind of ransom. But it holds its own, and has several parts where its just halarious.I give it four stars. Great extra features. I loved the commentary."
1,"Dude, Where's My Car?","So, my brother, his friends and I decided one saturday night to check this film out.The previews made sure to avoid the ridiculously stupid ""aliens"" are after them plot that takes over the movie. It really isn't even about finding his car. The acting was bad, the plot was from one of the worst scripts ever made, and the only funny parts were all shown in the previews. The only reason this has received any good reviews is that almost all the people who watched it were young kids who think it is cool to like this horrible show. Do not even waste your time.If you're into stupid comedy, watch ""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure"".SHIBBY..."
1,If only I could give zero stars...,"Yes, it's dumb, but no, it's not funny.And I love lowbrow humor. Like Dumb & Dumber...I laughed my hiney off and I'm no Carey fan. I rented this movie fully expecting something very stupid, and very funny.Well...it's very stupid, I gotta give it that... Only problem is that it never really got very funny. It looked funny from the commercials, but the problem is that those scenes were the ONLY funny parts of the movie. If you saw any commercials or reviews, don't bother renting or (heaven forbid!) buying the movie. You already saw the good parts.I just wanted to poke both of these idiots in the eye after about a half hour. I watched the whole dang movie waiting for it to ""get funny""...and it never did. No matter how much I smoked, it just didn't ever get funny. And I usually like watching idiots blunder around!Just do yourself a favor and at least rent it before you buy...this isn't a good flick to buy on the assumption it's gonna be good."
1,Dude wheres my money back?,This movie was terrible....even stiffler loses cool points for doing such a horrid movie....anyone who gave this 5-stars deserves to be dragged out of their house and blugeoned with a lead pipe.
2,DUDE! SWEET! DUDE ! SWEET! STUPID!,"I don't think this movie was terrible, but it certainly isn't a comedy classics or even one of the best comedies to come out of the year 2000 or 2001(whenever it came out, which i'm sure most people don't really care about). It's just brain candy. One of them gets DUDE and the other gets SWEET tattooed on their backs, this has to be one of the most ridiculously dumb scenes in movie history. There are much better comedy selections out there for you somewhat intelligent folk. I can't be held responsible for the rental fee of this film, that was my husband's job . This is more of a ""dude"" movie, I guess. Unless you are just suddenly in the mood for mindless dumb comedy with alot of T&A, then this will be right up your alley. It also has that cute guy, Ashton Kutcher from That 70s show as Jesse. Chester played by Seann William Scott is best known for his role in ""Road Trip"".(another mindless comedy)."
3,Read Review :P,"Okay, overall, i liked the movie, but just by a smidgen of a point as u can tell, the characters were really funny and the former ""stifler"" and current ""kelso"" were good picks for these parts. Seann William Scott makes really good movies for the teenage folk such as yours truly, and Ashton Kutcher i believe will do just as good. They played their chars very well, but the plot was very strange, they threw in a bunch of different random ideas, and imo, the writer was wasted himself as he wrote it. You never see it coming, but there is sci-fi added to the movie which really ruins it. If they stuck to the going around the neighborhood talking to people idea, it would have been better, but my eyes were rolling when the cult came in asking for the transsomething :P(stupid word, can't remember it). So what i am going for is that if u don't look at the screwy plot in this movie, you'll still like the chars, as long as you're not easily insulted"
2,Don't Buy This Movie!,This move is about two stoned idiots who can't remember what they did the night before and the whole movie is about remembering the night before. Overall this movie was OK and the ending made it a little better. To really enjoy this movie you would have to be stoned yourself!!!
5,Shibby!,"Dude, Where's My Car first struck me as a cheap... movie that a couple of teenagers made in their spare time; that was, of course, before I watched it! Not only do Jesse and Chester make you laugh your toes off, but they also have a sweet, semi-innocent look about them. Dude, Where's My Car is like a stoner version of Dumb and Dumber and is one movie that I'm going to have to add to my collection!"
1,Dude where's the funny?,This movie is not funny.Don't waste your money.I would love to give it 0 stars but apparently I have to give to give it at least one.
2,Dude wheres your car ??,"Well the movie was funny'. I guess I can give it that much.Two guys wake up and can't remember the night before, there car is missing 'dude where's my car' dude where's your car?' Is the famous saying through the whole movie'. The two go back and try to recap the night before to find out that they forgot there twin girlfriends anniversaries, run into some aliens who claim the two guys have a world saving device that works under mystical powers, not to mention they have some how gotten a strippers money and all this seems to be in there missing car.The movie had its funny one-liners and the two guys are sooooooooo stupid you wonder if people like that really exist. If you are looking for a pointless movie and like one-liners A LOT see it but other wise don't waste the effort."
2,At the Mall!,"I attempted to view this movie twice with equal disappointment both times. Granted, I was able to sit through the unrealistic ""Half Baked"" movie with a medium laughter scale, but this movie (which I thought was a match for Half Baked) was, indeed, not the icon it could have been. The movie's potential was lost after the first ten minutes and the ""Dude,"" ""Dude"" repetitiveness was spoken."
2,Pointless....,"This movie was just dumb, but some parts were funny that why it got 2 stars. It seems like the move was trying too hard to be the next Bill & Ted...but you know that's not gonna happen."
1,"Dude, Where's my stars?","Ok, after seeing this movie, I hoped to myself that there was a way of getting those wasted hours of my life back at some point. It was a Friday night, and I figued I'll go see a movie with the boys, so they pick this film. Natually I lose the ticket, and have to buy a new one. The movie is ideal for those who like mindless slapstick humor, in fact, a group of mindless stereotypical teen girls sat next to me and made the film extra terrible with their chatter and ridiculous comments which went perfect with the film which was of the same caliber.Not a thinking film. Not much of a comedy. Interesting (...) experience on the part of the writer and producers, I bet."
4,One of the dumbest movies ever made but a fun comedy,On a Friday night b4 I turned 21 a few years when I just felt like staying at home I rented this DVD and found out it's actually a funny flick. The plot revoles around two dudes trying to find their car and some other stuff. Seann William Scott steals the movie as always and he should have had top billing. Anyway just rent this flick and watch with the fellas and have some fun but be warned it's very very stuipd.
4,It's a gut splitter,"This film made me laugh. At times I laughed so hard I spit the beer I was [drinking] out...:-) It's that kinda flick. It's funny, then something even funnier happens that just busts you up....hard. A story of two - not too bright - dudes that party way too hard the night before, go outside the morning after and can't find the car. They trace the clues to follow their steps back to the places they were at the previous evening (that they have no recollection of) and discover they must have had a pretty wild time - But still can't find the car. If you enjoyed the comedy Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, then you will probably really enjoy this. Not for the high brow artsy types. This flick is for the kick back, turn off your brain and giggle and laugh goodtime crowd."
2,"If you think your getting ""Dumb and Dumber"" you're NOT!","This movie had some real potential to it. But by making the central plot line a quest for some alien space gadget, it comes up lame. Definitely should've just stuck to the simpler plot line of two hung over idiots looking for their car after a night of debauchery. Not a movie I would watch over and over, thus I would not recommend buying it."
2,It is dumb,"I borrowed this movie from my brother (thank goodness I didn't pay anything, even to rent it) and found it to be quite stupid. I love movies like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Bill & Ted, and this is no where close to any of these. Contrary to other reviews, the only funny parts I found were the tatto scene (saw it 100 times in the commercials, but still laughed at it, when he draws it out--""Suuuuuweeeet! What does mine say?"") and the bubble wrap parts. The Chinese restaurant scene was so not funny it actually made me mad.It gets two stars from me because I saw it for free after a long day with a sick child where I jsut wanted to get away from reality for a hour or two--it did accomplish that, but only minimally."
2,"Dude, Where's the Exit?!!","DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR aims at the protozoa that swim around in a puddle of sewer water...and succeeds. However, there is one hilarious scene worth watching! This is when our heroes, Jessie and Chester(Ashton Kutcher,Seann William Scott respectively) are in a chinese takeout drive-through... ""and then?""!! Well, you gotta see it because it's that funny. Otherwise, the plot(two Bill and Ted clones who wake up not having a clue of what they had done the night before, find their car missing, and then find themselves thwarting aliens who are trying to destroy the earth) is ridiculous and the main characters get annoying after awhile. Besides the chinese take-out drive-through scene, there are a lot of good lookin' babes to look at, but not much else."
2,Rent it... don't buy it,"Teens will enjoy this film, especially those aged 13-17. Although the two main characters look a bit old for the type of humor they employ, the film features a few excellent taglines and, in general, is quite refreshing.But beware, this is not your usual comedy and if you are looking for a masterpiece, you will be disappointed. I would not recommend you purchase this for your library as it is unlikely you will want to watch it for the second time. On the other hand, if you have a free evening and need some relaxation, which doesn't require you to think too much, this movie might be what you are looking for."
2,starts well,"starts well but after he doesnt find his car the story goes in a total other direction...people from space starts to show up and everything, i say it's wack"
2,Dude...wheres my money?,Unless your obsessed with Ashton Kutcher then there is no reason to see this movie. Its retarded and has no intresting plot line. There is no substance in this movie. Basically... its sucks.
1,Movies Like this Should Not be Made,"I honestly don't see the appeal in this movie. I went to see it in the theater with a friend when it first came out, and I absolutely hated it. This movie is not funny. It is not even unintentionally funny because of how dumb it truly is. It is just a movie that we sbould have been spared of. I wish I could give it less than a 'zero' rating because I cannot find the words to describe my distaste for this movie. It is a horrible waste of time and money, and I'd like to have a slittle as possible to do with it. In fact, the only reason I am writing this review is to warn anybody else interested in seeing this to give it a second thought."
1,Not worth the effort it's taking to write this.,"Every review here must have been written by a brain dead 14 year old. My brother recommended this movie to me (he was in 8th grade and I'm in college). I went with a friend and left after half an hour to go see ""Castaway"". THis is the only movie i have EVER walked out of. I used to think that was for pissy old parents who couldn't understand the movie. I even sat through Battlefield Earth to experience what is the worst movie of the young millenium. But this thing I could not bear to watch or listen to for it's breathtaking stupidity.Anyway when I got home I ...made (my) brother ... reimburse the 8.50 I spent on this steaming hunk of crap. Honestly if the rest of my generation finds this even remotely funny or entertaining, I worry."
2,Was This Supposed To Be Funny?,"If you were looking for a good comedy to make you laugh, well this movie is not it! There were some parts that made you laugh because they were so lame and dull. It made me laugh at some ridiculous parts so that's why i gave it some credit. I suggest not to go see it but, do not take my word for it you go and waste your money :)!"
1,DON'T EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE,"There are only two movies that I have ever wanted to walk out on and demand my money back...Batman and Robin AND Dude Where's My Car. I rated this movie with one star, if I could assign negative numbers, I would. This movie is horrible, don't waste your time, it'll be an hour and a half of your life you will never get back!"
5,"Dude, Wheres My Car?","Alright, this isnt the funniest movie to come out. And all the 1 star reviews, I dont bother to read. This movie was funny when I first seen it. I have the DVD. Its just REALLY stupid, and it makes it hilarious. Like when the dog was high, tell me that wasnt funny? I was rollin. This movie is funny from beggining to end trust me. Just give it a try, rent it at first to try it out. If it dont make you laugh, then you need to lighten up. Both the main actors in this movie, are known by everyone, and they can be funny. In this movie they are really stupid/funny. When they get captured by the nerds, wow, I was literally rolling, it was hilarious at how they acted. It has good stuff in this movie, just check it out. Its really worth the watch!!"
1,"Dude,Where's My Car?","Dude,Where's the movie?First off we start with a ridiculous dream sequence opening.The movie itself makes you wish you were in a dream sequence.""Calgon take this nightmare away""It's too bad,because Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott are pretty funny in other things they've done.All in all a very dissapointing and useless experience.So if anyone says dude watch this movie,take my advice run screaming."
2,........BUT THE ENDING WAS..............PANTS!!,ITS O.K BUT THE ENDING WAS.......PANTS!! SOME JOKES WERE UNFUNNY! INFACT THERE HASN'T BEEN A DECENT TEEN FILM FLICK! WHICH DISSAPOINTS ME MOST!
2,story plot,"This could be a good book but Gardner was not really a good writer, well for this book. He could have made the story more interesting but he did not.Some of the parts are not really interesting and very strange. Take for example, the part about two of the organisation members having a talk together, how could they not possibily not know that the British Secret service had been bugging the when the have the ability to start their operation ""WIN"" and ""LOSE""?"
2,JAMES BOND LOSES,"Why do most of John Gardner's James Bond novels seem like screenplays? I think that is what was always missing from his writings. Because they were similar to screenplays they read like movie scripts, not novels. It just leaves the reader so uninvolved. Detail and flavor for the settings are always noticeably absent from his Bond novels. This one is no exception. I suppose we all lose!"
4,Mystery endorsed,"Like the previous reviewer I have seen Angela Brown and the Mighty 45s live. This is the first time I've found reference to Angela Brown on a US web site. She may perform sometimes without the Mighty 45s but maybe not in the US at all. If she does a live performance, why is there no web coverage?"
3,A Classic Work,These black & white photographs by Erica Anderson are wonderful. It is a classic work on Albert Schweitzer. The only reason I give it three stars rather than five is the fact that the photos deserved to have been printed on a higher quality paper.
3,Good programming examples lacks context,"This book is filled with examples of how to use the JMX apis, but not a lot of explanation of how to design a JMX architecture, best practices, or what how you can use JMX practically in your enterprise. Being that the JMX api is actually pretty simple and straight-forward, I didn't find this book much use at all. A much better book in my opinion is ""Java and JMX: Building Manageable Systems"" by Kreger, Harold, and Williamson. That book does a much better job of going beyond ""programming"" JMX at a single point, and covering what the options and best practices are for building a management system using JMX.Get the ""In Action"" book only if you need to know the fundamentals of JMX in order to expose some Mbeans or write a quick client to manage a single application. If you really want to know how to use JMX to manage a distributed SOA architecture, then get the ""Java and JMX"" one."
3,JDMK necessary!!!,"The two first chapters do a perfect job to present the topic. So you beggin the third with eagerness and ... you can't compile the code!Why? After a moment you realize that the all the reamaing code source is based on Sun's JDMK! The catch is that you must by this library for (actually) 6000$ !!!!Ouch... no where in the book presentation/introduction/library necessary was any mention of this.Conclusion: if you have JDML this is an excellent book, if not you will need to write foundation code!"
2,ehhhhh,"I was REEEEALLY excited when I received my copy of this album. I took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting. I found myself pressing ""next track"" more than loving the music.It's definitely unique. Some of the songs are REEEALLY good, but the rest make up for it. Ugglor|Mossen might be one of the best songs I've ever heard. The rest of the cd can't compete though. The reason this album earned 2 stars is because this song is on it.I've reviewed a number of cds and box sets... if it's great GOA you're looking for you get you movin and groovin, go other places. It may be a great album for some of you looking for a unique sound that unmatchable (like I thought it would be), but I can't say I'm satisfied."
2,Not at all.,"Joyce is an experimenter, not an essayist.This book is ugly and boring.If you want to read good essays onliterature, art, philosophy or whatever,read Chesterton, Santayana, or Russell.Not a book to smile at."
4,Satisfied,"It is a good product to travel with or for an emergency, small enough to put in any bag. But it's not for heavy rains or more than 1 person."
4,The best of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer,"This set is a wonderful collection of Terence Hill's and Bud Spencer's classics.Some are them together and others their soloe films.The collection includes Nobody's the Greatest (a.k.a. A Genius two partners and a dupe.),Little Rita of the west,Renegade,All the way boy's and much more.It is the greatest set ever,filled with slapstick."
2,Trinity,"This was not what I was expecting. It wasn't as funny as any of the westerns. Nobody is my name for example. Very disappointed, not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself."
3,weak films by two great actors,"quantity not quality of film-making here. for very slow days only. all nuance and elements and little thematic build-up. only for those desperate to have basic, low-grade entertainment and see these two fine actors' easy-going play-throughs of scenes. shelf-filler mostly."
1,Disappointing,No westerns here - and poor quality. Also does not contain 10 films as advertised. How do folks get away with advertising things like this?
1,This Is A Rip-Off,The cover of this set specifically shows the two stars in a western together. There are no westerns with them together and 8 out of 10 of the movies are not westerns. This set is garbage and not even worth the 15 bucks it costs for the 10 movies.
4,Another slant on the founders.,"The book is a readable account of the beginnings of American newspapers, which were at times more biased and full of lies than today's worst news outlets. Looking at the beginnings of the United States from the publishing perspective also adds some interesting tidbits to our knowledge of Sam Adams, Hamilton, Jefferson, and others not so well-known to history. I found it an interesting--if not compelling--book to read a chapter at a time."
5,The eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was,"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism is the eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was. Feuds, partisanship, and outright lies often colored journalism of the era. Some founding fathers, such as Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Sam Adams, were leading journalists, others, such as George Washington and John Adams, passionately disdained journalists; and Thomas Jefferson was a skillful manipulator of journalists. Infamous Scribblers is divided into three sections: ""The Role of Authority"", ""The Approach of War"", and ""The Tumult of Peace"", all tracing the contentious relationship between the founding fathers and journalism throughout the birth of America. Highly recommended for American history shelves, and an absolute ""must-have"" for public and college libraries."
5,Newspapers are still a rag,"""Infamous Scribblers"" was a fantastic read. Newspapers haven't changed much since colonial times. the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up, and the infighting of politicians and printers, among themselves and with each other. It brought out things about our founding fathers that aren't in your regular history books. There is a very great likeness of events and people then and now, The one big difference today is newspapers don't attack like they did then. They didn't hold back much at all and would keep it up and not backdown. Give it a try I think you will enjoy it....Ken"
3,Nice,"Not quite as large and chunky as I would have liked, but a beautiful watch nonetheless. Has a nice weight to it too."
3,"Loved the first one and his other work but this, hmmm.","I loved the first instalment as the 'zombies' acted and came to life in such a unique way and the story was just what I like. This book I just couldn't seem to love and my eyes kept wandering from the page, I thought that it was very impersonal as alot of characters were introduced with some having a back story but most were just names and also a few were introduced then never mentioned again so I couldn't get into it. And alot of just pushing the dead away seemed to do the trick of escaping even though the sheer volumes of dead would overwhelm you even if they were weak, everyone just had no trouble getting from A to B and no nail biting, oh my god are they going to escape, moments happened for me. Not a bad book just not as good as the first."
4,The walking Dead and the people who love them,"Not the most technically sound writing in publication but very far from the worst. For zombie fans, there really is no such thing as a bad zombie story, but David Moody's work really is something special. Its not your run of the mill flesh eating frenzy type of story and that's refreshing. The Autumn novel's power resides not in their ability to disgust or in the description of violence, but in the psychological despair and utter hopelessness that would be felt by the survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Very emotional, very disturbing, utterly wonderful."
5,They are everywhere,"Have read both books. Love them. I really respect the way these zombies are different. They re-animate differently and don't seem like a huge pack of rabid dogs from the beginning. The writer gives them a more human quality, and has more to talk about the morality of killing them because of it. This is not just a gash and slash blood fest. It is a zombie book, but it develops the characters very well. Will there be a 3? I hope so."
5,give him his props,"Little Walter Jacobs doesn't seem to get the respect he deserves. Let's fix that right now: it says here that ""Hate to See You Go"" is one of the top five blues studio recordings...ever! First off, there's the huge, steely sound of Little Walter's harmonica, amplified (he was the first in Chicago to do so) and drenched in lonely reverb. Then comes the biting lead/rhythm guitar of Walter's pal Muddy Waters, along with primitive, powerful drumming. This is a fine set of songs, very diverse by blues standards, mostly written by Jacobs or Willie Dixon. But best of all is Walter's vocal approach: raw, primal, but controlled, full of personality. He emotes the pain of a Robert Johnson or Billie Holiday, and the aggression and power of Muddy. This is a must for anyone with even a passing interest in Chicago Blues."
3,Drapery Rings,"I'd love to correctly review this product, but I'm still waiting for the Tension Rod that goes with these drapery rings! Unfortunately it's on backorder for another MONTH!!! So I think the Drapery Rings will look great, but they will sit in a box until the Curtain Rod gets here!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm hoping the rest of my order really WILL come 'cuz I won't need these Rings without the Rod!"
5,great curtain rod rings!,These work great on my curtains...they are big enough for the larger curtain rods. Look very professional.
5,rings on the windows,"these are the best for hanging curtains, just open the clamp put in the curtain material, slide on the rod and the window treatments are finished,I use these rings for all my windows.quality metal, smoothly finished and well made."
4,Easy Door Curtain,These clips allowed me to hang a curtain across a doorway without hampering access. They slide easily on the rod and look great!
3,Simple story of brave fliers,"This is a thin book of 92 pages and quick to read. The author's religious faith (Mormon) is well threaded through the story, and while the book is interesting it is short on detail and tends to act as a vehicle to promote the work of the artillery recon pilots as being the most important contributor to military aviation in WW2. I enjoyed the book, but it lacked substance. Make sure you sample more detailed books such as ""Above the Thunder"" (Raymond Kerns) to learn more about liaison aircraft in WW2."
2,Review of Grasshopper Pilot: A Memoir,"I have an interest in the L-4, and thought this might be interesting. I felt the book lacked military detail, and was too general in its presentation. I would have enjoyed more information about the places and events."
5,Grasshopper Pilot,"I read this book through twice. I found it to be easily read and kept my attention. I am glad that I found and read this book, because it gave me a perspective about military aviation that I knew about, but did not have the information about how effective it really was. All the fighter and bomber pilots wrote about their exploits, and little was ever said about light aircraft used in WWII. I am glad that was written to document this type of military aviation to preserve it's history and give it the respect it deserves."
3,"great, but build up","This is a good faucet for the money, but i find that where the handle lifts up a film forms for the water not completely draining."
5,"I've played it 5,000 times since I bought it.",My favorites are May I Serve Thee and Wrap You In Love
2,Fun toy while it lasted,"This is a cute toy you can use indoors. However, the first one we got broke (the fan died) within the first 30 mins we had it. We returned it and got a second one. That one was missing a screw on the battery case so I had to find one that would fit on it. It's poor quality but fun."
2,"Lots of fun, but unreliable","It's fun--great to play with on hardwood or tile floor. I don't think it works on low pile carpet as it claims, but it provides good indoor fun and exercise with minimal danger to people, walls and furniture. UPDATE--I liked it so much that I bought one for my nieces and nephews, but theirs never worked. I don't think they ever bothered to attempt to return it."
3,Library of Congress Remixed,"Here's a great way to make a buck. Take some classic old 78 rpm church hollers and barrel-house rockers and sync in some beats per minute and have people call you a break-thru musical genius. I have to give Moby credit though. At least he's introducing compu-teens and upwardly-mobile handshakers to the shakes and quakes of the old school yard groove. When he keeps the field out of the studio, he creates some thoughtful moments, such as ""Porcelain"". And original collaborations like ""Why does my heart feel so bad"" shine as well. Overall, the album flows nicely and makes a satisfying salute to the joy of music. But has Moby changed the face of music? At the very least he's learned how to program its soul. My recommendation: Buy this along with an Alan Lomax field-recording. Decide for yourself if the tree trimmer has injured any of the roots."
3,Moby . Looks like Fatboy Slim just a lot better,Play is a good album for the people who are new to electronica. I have to admit though Moby could have been more creative. He often uses a voice sample excessively. THat can be a little annoying. I hope Moby challenges himself further in later albums. I guess Play is Moby way to further finance himself. It's to commercial and plus he isn't the first to use gospel and blues singers is electronica. Moby is good but Recoil is better.
5,What a masterpiece!,"I had only heard of Moby before this from his song ""Oil 1"" from The Saint soundtrack. One of my friends is responsible for turning me onto one of the ten best CD's of my 900+ collection. I cannot even begin to tell you how great this CD is. Usually ""GREAT"" CD's have 8 or 9 great tracks out of 12. Every single track on this album is great. Of course some stand out in my mind like the beautiful ""Porcelain"" and ""Natural Blues"", and the tropical island reminiscence of ""My Weakness."" The combination of Old Jazz samples, modern techno beats, and hauting vocals; works to perfection in creating one the the best albums of all time, OF ANY GENRE! Moby's faith seems to play a large part in creating an ethereal ambience of heaven! You don't have to be an arrogant sophisocate to like this, just a lover of music. Buy it, and if you don't like it, I will personally refund your money."
5,Simply Genius,"Words can hardly express what Moby has done to music coming into a new decade. Moby has inspired thousands of people to look beyond there normal window of musical vision. Play has turned mothers, fathers, children and other cultures into eclectic music lovers. Music is suppose to move you or reflect a mood and I can tell you Moby has created a masterpeice that has touched many people, myself included. It's simplistic nature is the true genius and I can not imagine ever getting sick of it."
4,Comercialism as Art or Vice Versa,"I got hooked on Moby through hearing his songs on TV commercials. Maybe a sad commentary on our times, but I are grateful to be introduced to his music, and I'm sure he's grateful to have his record sales rocket. Consistently moving but also eminently danceable, Play is one of my favorite discs. I have it nearby at all times."
4,Wonderful,This has to be Moby's best work. I especially enjoy Run On it's different than Moby's usual songs but it's grrrrrrrreat. I highly reccomend this CD I know you will enjoy it.
4,Very very nice,"I got this CD because my friend has been raving about him ever since ""I Like To Score"". So I thought since this was #1 at the Virgin Megastore, I'd check it out. I ended up like the first track, so I bought it to further listen to it. I listened to it, and it was kind of boring, until Run On came on. Run On is simply a masterpiece. One of the best songs this year. This whole album is worth it just for Run On. But Honey and Bodyrock are also very good tracks. But almost the rest of it is kind of boring, but it is still a great CD."
5,Moby is a genious!,"For some strange reason, I haven't seen any bad reviews. It's nice to know people like the same kind of music as me. Moby's ""Play"" is the first album I've ever bought by the artist. If I had never seen him on MTV or Space Ghost I probably never would have bought the album. This is the second best electronnica album I've bought in a long time, right next to Norman Cook's ""Better Living Trough Chemistry""."
1,drivel,"A complete waste of time and money. I bought this based on a few songs I had heard on the radio. Unfortunately, the songs I liked on the radio were not on the album. Aparently the good versions are on the b-sides and remixes. You might want to look there first.I've only been able bring myself to listen to it a handfull of times. The album has no energy, no spark. None of the songs had that ""play it again"" interest. Several of the songs were of the ""let's not go there again"" variety.I bought other albums at the same time and they are wonderful: Olive 'Trickle', BT 'Movement In Still Life' and Delerium 'Karma'. I can repeat play all day and not get sick of hearing them."
1,zZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz,"This CD is so boring! There are no good up beat trax on this cd, Buy this CD if you like for music to put you to sleep!"
1,The most boring recording EVER!,"This is, in my opinion, techno at it's best. However, because it is techno, it's AWFUL. Every track here is about twice as long as it should be, and each gets boring after the first minute. I despise techno because it's always the same thing over, and over, and over. And over. And over. The sampling just rips off other artists, and what little new musical ingenuity exists is buried so deeply in the mix that all you hear is the damn drums and the same samples replayed indefinitely. A little bit of lyrical change would be nice too, instead of ""Rock y'all, gonna stock y'all, to the beat y'all, the bodyrock y'all"" twenty seven times over. And over. And over. And over. And over."
2,simple but scary,"If I didn't know any better, I would think that this album was put together in a day as an afterthought. I've always been a firm believer in simplicity, but I have also been a firm believer in talent, which in the case of Moby, is nonexistant. If become a recording ""artist"" is this easy, what the heck an I doing? ""Run On"" should of been the name of all the songs."
2,How the hell did this album get on the Best of 99!,"It's a moderately good dance record with a couple of stand-out tracks. It's nowhere near as good or as ground-breaking as 'Everything Is Wrong'. It's sample overload. It's a unfocused. It works in places and not in others. It's 'clever'.If you're dipping a toe into the murky waters of dance music, and you want a 'safe' CD from a North American artist to play at dinner parties, buy this. It's better than Deep Forest or Vengaboys.But seriously, how is the Best of 99 list made up? Who decides? It's like a dance music equivalent of a rock list including The Eagles, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. All good acts ... but not in the running any more."
4,this album is the best,i dont know moby s music but i have kistened only natural blues and why does my heart feels so bad?and they are the best songs to relax! so long dudes moby 4 ever
1,Unoriginal piece of boring work,I bought this CD by reading the comments of few of the other reviewers and to say that I am disappointed would be less. This album in no way can be classified as Techno/Electronica or be compared to Prodigy/Chemical Brothers. Also the music is hackneyed and seems to be inspired by Enigma. Moby has lot more work to do to get into the genre of Prodigy or Chemical Brothers.
5,Love ya Moby!,"Moby music is awesome. I pity the fool who does not like it. If you don't have it, buy it!"
4,playin around,"The best thing about this disc is the great ""rants"" (or essays-whatever) that Moby writes in the liner notes. Being neither a Vegan nor a Christian I still enjoyed reading what he had to say; the man is coherent!This was my 1st introduction to Moby. (Actually that one song on the Gone in 60 sec. sndtk was...I digress). I Think its a terrifically solid CD and a good intro into what Moby is all about. If you think you might like Moby, also check out 18 and I like to Score."
4,Moby Continues His Great Style,"The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond. Since then I've been hooked on his music, and he certainly doesn't disapoint on this great album. One thing that Moby has, is a unique sound. He will never sound old, or his style of music will never be used by others, because no one could copy Moby. It isn't Rock, nor techno. it's something in between On this album, all the songs are strong, but in particular I think the song ""why does my heart feel so bad"" is the best. It pours out the most emotion without a doubt. It was used in the trailers of Black Hawk Down, and was used perfectly. Overall, if you are a fan of Moby, Buy this album!!"
4,moby,I enjoy Moby's unique music. Very soothing and takes you to another place . I'm ready for the next one!
5,"So far, the best CD of 1999.",An amazing recording. Congratulations Moby; thank you for the moving music and for the enlightening essays.
2,Has been,"This was such a great album when it came out, but maybe I just got sick of hearing the songs played over and over again in commercials. It's just not happening any more."
1,not as good as all that,"this album - overated? yes. Overhyped? yes. overplayed? yes.are there any redeeming features? yes. the end.short, but to the point, this album is overated tripe, worthy of nothing but burning."
1,Shame.....,"It's such a pity that so many 'top' artists today have to rely so heavily on the work of others. How can sampling the work of someone else be classed as original? Once again, this is an album created more from the effort and skill of others than from any new input. Sure, it's well put together, and it does have it's moments, but sadly, they owe their origins to other artists rather than Moby."
1,Shallow...,"So I finally downloaded this entire album because of all I heard about it. Yet another shining example of why I should never trust mass opinion when it comes to music. Firstly, this is not techno. If you want techno, go listen to Underworld or Juno Reactor. This is ambient / electronic with soul / R&B samples. A rather intresting idea, but it comes off as remarkably cheesy and not very catchy either.If self-help books came with musical accompinaments, this is what they would sound like. Nice non-thought provoking, non-challenging background music for the masses to lap up. Yum!"
1,Don't fall for it! Your heart isn't made of plastic!,"Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold, synthetic, superficial beats, create an unsettling tension that sounds unintended. He should be made to leave his room and go out and get some exercise."
2,Fades Fast,"Initial I loved this CD, but it didn't last. Soon the tracks started to grate and seem just a to predictable and calculated. Maybe I'm being unfair, I am comparing to Leftfields Leftism, which still sounds original and fresh 6 years on. Compared to them Moby is twiddling in the sandpit."
3,Moby Gets Jiggy With It,"When listening to Moby's magnum opus, I couldn't help but notice the similarity to benign pop sclock like Will Smiths 'Get Jiggy With It', as opposed to brilliant electronica like Fat Boy Slims 'Praise You'. As much as I enjoyed this disc, it just feels a little too cookie cutter, as opposed to the break through master piece it's been hailed as."
2,Drowning in the stuff,"I, a techno fan, hate it. My two best friends, who are avid blues fans, hate it. The songs drag on forever. In fact, the only good thing about this album is the Bodyrock. An Moby's shiny little head."
3,More integrity and humility please,I know the personality of the performer should be irrelevant when judging the quality of the music BUT 1] Moby allowing his music to be used for car ads strikes me as immensely hypocritical considering his so-called 'green' credentials and 2] the sheer EGO of the man that came across during his recent Glastonbury performance really stuck in the craw bigtime. A shame - as I would have given the album an unconditional ***** only six months ago...
5,Best CD of 1999,"Sadly neglected at the Grammy's, this collection of gospel-techno-ambient-soul food was the best CD of 1999. Each track is different, but all favor the unique, almost subliminal beat and subtle sampling that is Moby's trademark. Ideal for creating Spinning(R) mixes, or play the first 7 tracks straight through. This album is the benchmark from which all future ""DJ/Dance"" releases will be judged. favorite cuts ""Southside"" and ""Natural Blues"""
4,Had me hooked from the start...,"I found that I purchased ""Play"" for Moby's cut ""Porcelain"". The more I listened to this CD, the more I found alternative favorites. This is my first Moby purchase, and I'm thrilled I stumbled on it. (Diehard Moby fans excuse me - I'm just learning) I find many tracks to be calming and peaceful (ie: ""My Weakness"") and a few that I could live without that seem to interrupt the overall feel of this CD. Another reviewer noted that you need to turn this one up to hear the intricate details...I highly recommend this latest from Moby - the integration of a funky club beat with piano solos is very intriguing. I'm not one to usually contribute to an internet review, but this one had me hooked from the start."
5,Play it again,"If I would have to name top 10 songs list, about 5 of them would be in this CD. I like techno-like music which happens to be almost all the time very annoying when listened too much. Moby is something else because of his original style putting peaceful samples in tracks. Like Porcelain isn't actually quite usual for any genre of music. Overall: Best album ever and it's long, too! Not any 40 minute 10 track album but 18 tracks and length over an hour. It's unfair to hope better album from him, but I still hope that his next would be even better (if possible)"
4,Great,"Moby sure knows how to play a fine melody. A lot of songs on 'Play' sound great and do have immediate appeal. It is very nice to listen to 'Play'. Highlights are: 'Porcelain', 'Southside', 'Why does my heart ...', 'If things were perfect', 'Everloving', 'Guitar, flute and string'. Well, what more could you ask ? After all: it is the music what it is all about ...If you listen closely to 'Play' I have to admit that Moby is not original in his approach. He is [borrowing] ideas from other artists. Ok. Who cares ? It sure sounds great.It is very simple: Moby is not a great musician technically spoken, neither groundbraking in his style(s). He simply knows how to touch your heart and soul. After a while I am sure I will find 'Play' a bit cheesy and 'cheapish' and maybe I will stop playing it then. I suspect that these songs will not make an everlasting impression to me. Ok. Who cares ? Radiohead's 'Ok Computer' in the end proved to have a lifecycle also."
2,Booorrriiinng,"This is one of the most boring albums I've ever heard. I've read some of the reviews, and this is not even close to techno/trance/electronica. Not only that, but most of the album wasn't even done by Moby. It's old recycled stuff with a bassline and drum beats spliced in. It does have its redeeming songs like Porcelain, Natural Blues, and the radio-friendly, Bodyrock, but on the whole, this is NOT the album its been hyped up to be."
1,music for car commercials,"i don't have this cd, but it was playing everywhere between mid-1999 and early 2001 - in stores, on tv, at work.....this is just ""pretty"" music that takes itself way too seriously. it's nothing original either."
4,could do without gospel,"I bought this the day it came out (almost 1 year now i beleive) i bought it because i was a fan of his, and this was a beautiful album.Moby is an electronic musician with rock influences. He is not known as a singer, and his singing on this album is hardly a high point or something to praise. He makes music and hew is very good at it (vocally as well.)Now he is very popular because of a movie soundtrack. WOW! Now people everywhere will praise his singing. Hes been around for quite a few years, and this album is hardly new."
1,who knew?,"who knew that there was such a big audience for 93 style trip hop and adult lite jazz. i would recommend just about any electronic cd over this one. Hell, I would even recommend jock jams over this cd.MOBY is serious wack. he failed at his late attempt at switching to grunge rock and now hes jumped back into dance music with a seriously dated style. i gues there are a lot of people who have no clue about dance and electronic music. very dissapointing."
3,"Interesting, but overrated.","I bought this CD based on the nearly breathless reviews I read in WIRED and AMAZON.COM. While I generally found the music thoughtful and ingenuous (despite the vacuous liner notes) it was technically uninspiring.The core of the album is basically 4/4 drum beats with guitar and keyboard arpeggios, and some sampling of some old blues artists thrown in for good measure.If you really want to hear musical genius using the most sophisticated musical tools available today, check out PAT METHENY GROUP. ""Imaginary Day,"" and ""We Live Here"" are both excellent CDs from this remarkable international ensemble."
4,"Clean, special music",I like what this guy's doing. He really knows how to put inspiration on its feet!
5,"A spur of the moment purchase, but what an album!","When I moved up to university I was listening to the singles charts on the radio, and ""Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?"" charted at number 16 (in the UK) and I thought ""wow!""! It really captured the mood I was in during that period.Few months later, I heard ""Natural Blues"", followed by ""Porcelain"".Whilst shopping, I thought I should take a chance and buy this album and it was a chance well taken.There is an interesting mixture of songs, (When I heard ""Honey"" for the first time I laughed, as I didn't know what to expect!), with the atmospheric, relaxing songs near the end of the 18 track album."
1,"No matter what I come up with, it's still too kind...","Seriously, how can anyone like this dreck?But before I start my rantings, I must say that ""Bodyrock"" and ""Machete"" are awesome tracks. Unfortunately, in my opinion, they are the ONLY tracks worth listening to on the entire c.d.. Two tracks out of eighteen... Pretty sad average if you ask me.That is, of course, unless you like listening to old blues and gospel remixed with a techno-feel.But I do have to give credit to his label for picking ""Bodyrock"" as the first, and so far only, single to be released. Had they picked from the other anthing-but-sweet-sixteen pieces of trash, I honestly don't think that the c.d. would have sold more than 100 copys.But, to each their own."
1,moby = genius ¿? why ¿?,"People are saying that moby is like a god, that he is one of the world best producer, people say that his this record, Play, is the album of the year, ¿?. I have heard this is the best techno album ever. I cannot understand this things. Please forgive me, but in my view, Play is simply a bad album. The only thing moby has made, is sample some old soul vinyls, and put music behind. And believe me, that the only good things of this album are these voices, which are the only things moby has not made. The drums are simply bad produced, the music is simply, and his voice is, oh my god!, why anybody has say to moby that he cannot sign?. You could say me you like some of the album songs, but please, DON'T SAY ME THAT MOBY IS A GOOD PRODUCER AND DON'T SAY THAT PLAY IS ONE OF THE BEST 90's ALBUM!!!"
3,Puh-Lease!,"People! Yes, this is good, but if this is reinventing-your-world good, get out and listen to music!And other people-please. Just because you've heard non-pop music, you aren't God, you don't have to be such snobs. You don't have to be too good for it if it sounds nice, which it does, whether or not you admit it. I mean, one of the many who complain about repetitiveness cited sigur ros as music you should listen to instead! Sigur ros is frickin' amazing, but, less repetitive? So don't hate. It doesn't make you better to call what other like crap.In short, don't write the 5 star, ""it changed my life"" review, because it doesn't do anybody any good, and you probably aren't exactly a musical expert, either. And don't wirite the one star, ""the world is coming to an end if this guy is called a musician review"" just because you think you're the world's foremost expert on good music."
1,Electronicrap,"lets put it this way: if you want to buy the juggling alchemists under the black light, or IFO by etnica/pleiadians, you can expect to pay hundreds of dallars. probably more if you want it on vinyl, or care about condition. i just saw a mint condition IFO on vinyl up for sale for a fitting $604.00. (goa). it's not a limited edition vinyl, it's not signed, it doesn't have extra tracks, most if not all of their fans have a downloaded version of it on their harddrives, and it's not pressed from solid gold. it's just a regular old IFO album. and people will buy it for that price. they will buy it because the pleiadians/etnica are genius. no one's spending $604.00 on a moby album. at this point you may be thinking that no album is worth hundreds of dallars. if so, that's because you listen to moby, and think play is a good album."
2,There is NO way this CD is one of the best of the 1999,"I purchased this CD because everyone is raving about it. I mean I ever heard about it on a night time sitcom...but whatever the case, I found this CD a utter disappointment. granted there are a couple tracks that I thought were okay, but the rest of the CD was a waste. I mean what is going on with the chanting. The bottom line here is people loved this CD becasue it was new, not that it was great."

2,plaY,One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani. Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby. Waste of money
1,I pity the fool,To me it is wrong morally for someone to use the work of people who have passed on in your music.the decest whose old blues vocals he samples arent able to defend there work from this evil techno machine.heres msomething original use a living persons voice for your vocals
2,An Aaron Carter RIPOFF,"This guy thinks he's so clever because he ""does"" his own music. Well, machines do most of it, he just presses buttons. But ripping off Aaron Carter and Lizzy Maguire's style is downright atrocious. Stay away from this carbon copy borefest. I'm feeling cranky today. Get some original music by real, innovative musicians such as Cannibal Corpse, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Death, Led Zeppelin, and Tori Amos, to name but a few. Have a happy day."
1,Don''t believe the hype,"Hearing wonderful reviews of Moby, I decided to check out this album myself. I was very dissapointing. To me, most of the first few tracks are unlistenable. The best song on the album, South Side, is terrific. A wonderful duet with Gwen Stefani of No Doubt, South Side can find a place in everyone's library of music.Porcelain is another good song, with a very relaxing string orchestra, and although it may not be better than South Side, it delivers very well.Don't be the album, just buy those two songs.It'll save you money and stress."
1,Noise,"When I first listened to this album, I was startled to hear raspy voices and clunky piano sounds combined into what sounded like obnoxious noise. I thought, ""The whole cd can't be like this."" I was right: the rest of the songs are even worse. Moby has taken samples of gospel singing and thrown them together with syrupy, maudlin new-age sounds. The gritty texture of gospel voices does not compliment the wimpy, synethesized ""muzak"" - somehow, the ill-fitting combination makes both styles seem ludicrous. The best way to enjoy this music is from under the influence of some kind of mind-altering substance - but only if you're the type who enjoys having a bad trip."
4,Excellent!,"Just got the CD today and can't stop listening to it. The music is really soulful and yet at the same time has great techno beats. This CD makes for great upbeat ambiant background music while on the computer or cleaning your room. OR great to listen to, sing to or get up and dance to. The music on this CD is really easy to listen to, it doesn't get on your nerves like some CDs do! Buy it, you won't be disappointed!Also recommended: Santana - supernatural, Nirvana - nevermind, REM - Green, REM - Murmur, Best of House Music, Vol. 3 - various artists"
5,It was all good. Full of excitement and ready to jam.,"It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. Oh yeah, it was all good."
4,Upbeat AND ambient - This is really great,"Play is one of those records that you can take any where. The number of good tracks on it is quite phenomenal; out of the twenty songs, there is only really one or two that aren't truly wondeful. There is something for whatever mood you're in, whether you want to party HONEY/BODYROCK/SOUTH SIDE) or you really just need to chill (WHY DOES MY HEART.../INSIDE/NATURAL BLUES) This is definitely one of the best Records i have ever bought - wonderful!"
2,Just another CD for a collection..,"Well, I gave this CD a listen and it became just that, merely another CD in the collection. It has some interesting points but too much piano for my tastes. Personally I listen to techno to get away from conventional instruments which I find rather boring..this is great background music though!"
4,One mans junk is another mans treasure.......,"This is one of the years best and certainly the best that Moby has put out. Those that accuse Moby of ripping off blues/gospel are in one word..jealous! Sorry you nay-sayers didn't think of it first. From the opening track Moby handles each sample with reverance, surrounding each with either deeply penetrating grooves or transcendent arrangements. A deeply moving much needed reprive from electronicas same 'ol stuff. This record can make the most uptight white boy want to get funky!"
3,Did you know he was in the HC band VATICAN COMMANDOS?,"Yea, prior to doing this stuff which isn't bad. It reminds me of Beck. There's a heap 'o stuff here. My daughter when she was around 15 was horrified that I like PET SHOP BOYS. It's what we call a guilty pleasure. But their hits are dance done right, great overall presentation. Normally, I like JIMI, punk, hardcore punk, international hardcore punk and rock with some jazz and some world. I tried this and was not disappointed but it's not really for me. Lotsa energy, lotsa ideas but doesn't really ring my bell. PET SHOP BOYS hits, that does it for me. Glad I bought it, especially since I bought the VATICAN COMMANDOS 7"" and 12"" back in the early 80's and glad i did, real hot hardcore punk rock. ciao bella. God bless."
5,amazing work of music,"i bought this cd used, just a few weeks after it came out (i guess someone didn't like it, their loss). i hadn't heard much of moby's stuff other than his dance-y material but this was a welcome surprise. it's musical beauty permeates your soul and fills one with goodness (i know that sounds cheesy). moby does a wonderful job with the voice samples he uses and his mellow, slow instrumentals are his best yet (i favor track 14, everloving)."
2,boring,"This album is enough to make you want to go to sleep. With the exceptions of tracks 1,5,7, and 9 (which rock and save the album)this album just drags on and on with boring ambient techno (which is cool, but the ambient techno on this album is just a waste of Moby's talent). Moby's worst album in my opinion."
2,Disappointing,"Most of the reviews I've read say that this is Moby's best album. I think that Everything is Wrong is a much more interesting and varied album. Play is too long, and the songs all tend to run together. I have never been able to listen to the whole thing, because frankly, it gets a little tedious. It's true that on the tracks like Honey, Find My Baby and Run On, where Moby samples blues and gospel vocals, the CD really picks up some steam. Unfortunately those tracks don't really represent the entire album. Check out Everything is Wrong if you're just coming to Moby's music."
3,Uneven,"the album is a good introduction to ""electronic"" music to the uninitiated, but it fails to live up to my expectations. i have only listened to go and everything is wrong by moby but this recording seems to be piled in the same bin with them...uneven. if you want to listen to some intersting techno with your friends cruising around town on the weekend though...buy this and all other prodigy and chemical brothers cd's leave aphex and squarepusher to the ones who love music...real layers, real complexity...this is fake and contrived...i wish moby would expand his instrumentation but it seems he is content murking around with that one synth sound that evokes emotion in me i must admit...but it is fake emotion...anyway..go ahead and buy it if you want it...don't take my word for it as reading rainbow would say."
1,Moby takes a great idea out back and shoots it,"Is this the dullest CD of all time? I'm not sure, but it certainly is a candidate. Moby is on to a great idea -- the combination of found sound sources with beats -- but the problem is that this is well-tread ground. Many many many have been here before. Moby adds nothing to the genre. His source material is also mined from the same veins that have been used so much before. This is kind of like Fat Boy Slim -- but not as catchy.There is a great record yet to be made with this concept. This isn't it."
1,One huge R.L.BURNSIDE ripoff--the rest pretentious drivel,"Another overrated record. Moby found some old blues recordings and slapped them on top of disco, probably because they are in the public domain and he doesn't have to pay any royalties. Sure he's ripping off the man, just like all the white boys of the past, and all the kids will buy it not knowing where to find the real thing. He is obviously desperate for a new direction, since this CD seems completely directionless. If you like these bogus beats, go get yourself some R.L. Burnside and treat yourself to the real thing."
3,"so so, half an' half","i have mixed feelings about moby's play album. most songs were one extreme or the other, love it, hate it, with only machete being in the middle. most notable in my opinion are honey, why does my heart feel so bad, run on, porcelian, down slow, and if things were perfect. all the above were in the first half of the cd. i started out liking the second half of the cd, but after the 2nd or 3rd slow song, it started to bore me and put me to sleep. most of it sounds like typical ambient new age music that can be found anywhere (i've heard very similar slow music by deep forest). i tend to skip over the more commercially popular songs such as body rock, south side, and natural blues since they're pretty worn already. overall, i'll probably use this cd to rip and make mixes with other songs i like, but i don't enjoy enough of it for it to be a regular in my cd player."
4,a genious in his own right... (4 Stars),"Moby has always been a man to push the envelope wide open, and surprisingly the music industry for once caught a genious in action. This is the first Moby disc that has recieved world-wide fame, but it IS for good reason. This is a classic both in dance and good old rock-and-roll. It's Moby at his finest.So good, in fact, that many like myself are forced to purchase the ""B-Sides"" album and some of the man's earlier stuff, starting probably with ""Mobysongs"" the greatest hits released right before he made the extrication of ""Play."" Sheer genious in every respect, with a handful of singles, a growing fanbase, and praise from critics, Moby is now right where he belongs; on the forefront of rock-and-roll. Enjoy his masterpiece...."
4,Moby,"Moby is pretty cool and I think teh best song on Play is Bodyrock. I also like Honey and 7. I rated it 4 out of 5 because there are some bad songs, but I recomend listening to it and buying it."
4,An Emotional Trip,"I hadn't heard of Moby until recently, and I must say, this is excellent work here. I really enjoy the more serious, if not depressing side of this brave artist. The cut titled ""Why does my heart feel so bad"" is a beautiful and forgiving tune. It's this darker more serious side of Moby, that has caught me. ""My Weakness"" is another that tells us something more is under the surface of this man.You will hear and feel a different world through him. No wonder it's a Grammy nominee! I highly recommmend you buy this right away if not sooner. Sit back and listen to Moby's world as it comes to you."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I purchased this cd on someone's fervent recommendation, and am pretty disappointed in the very limited scope of this artist's work, as well as in the over-use of sampling. The piano flourishes are in no way clever or interesting. This is merely ho-hum dance hall stuff without any real depth. You want enlightenment? Check out ANYTHING by Orbital; they understand and employ technology and polyphony better than just about any group. Also, Moby's proselytizing in the liner notes are just so annoying!"
5,If God wrote pop,"One moment Moby seems to distill the wisdom of the ages, the next moment the music exists for the sheer joy of being. Elegantly balanced, superbly crafted. Want a soundtrack for your life? You could do no better than this work."
1,"disappointed in the lack of ""content""","This album is just awful. I bought it expecting something completely different, like content. It's just a series of sampling tracks, as if Fatboy Slim teamed up with the mid 90's group ""Beautiful People"" for a duets album. It has one redeeming quality...I think it would be a valuable resource for an avertising exec for commercial music. I recognized two tracks that are currently background music in TV commercials. And don't get me started on the liner notes. Moby missed their audience with my purchase. My dog liked it though, he's crunching on it now."
3,Elevator Music,"For the majority of this CD, the songs are great just to relax to. There is little substance to any of the songs and many are very strange. If you would just like to sit back and relax to calming elevator music, buy this CD."
2,Ehhhhh...,"Moby chose samples dripping with soul, and threw sterile beats around them. The work was already done for him. He didn't write a lot of this, he just arranged cute little sound collages. Yee haw. This record should come off as blasphemous, but it is just an honest, silly record."
3,like the song eric caparas.,"hi my name is eric i down load samples before buying them for my dj mix show. in the year 2000, i will build a pirite radio station on 91.1 fm digital stereo. in el cajon, ca. i also been in a movie called cheer fever out next year too hope any fans would respond to eceric@theglobe.com. i do dance mix show for the friday and saturday night street partys. and at the drive at five. favorite your favorite club music back to back beat to beat in the mix. the Q96.1 FM."
2,For the musical children,"Extremely basic, and fairly sad effort all in all. The fact that it's so popular just proves how bad pop music has become and how little people actually listen to music. Because you really listened to this album you wouldn't hear alot!Worst of all you can hear the plagerism in all the songs.But it's catchy and makes people happy so i give in minor credit."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I have recently gotten into the likes of Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, and Orbital. Maybe it was my bad for not doing more research, but Play is boring to me and I hope I can help others with my taste avoid it.If you are looking for upbeat electonic stuff, (Prodigy Fat of the Land and Orbital II are my favs) stay far away from this. If you want repetitive gospel type singing laid over basic beats, knock yourself out."
2,My grandma like it...,"I bought a 12 inch version of Go, years ago. I bought this last week. What a bore! But my grandma like it, she said it was 'pretty' so I guess I'll give it 2 stars for my grandma."
3,A truly unique work,"The reason I bought this album, like most people, was the single ""South Side,"" a remix of which (featuring Gwen Stefani) plays on the radio. So listening to ""Play"" was somewhat of a shock, since South Side is the most rock-based song on the CD, and it dosn't have Gwen's voice in it, making it sound hollow. I was also taken aback by the lack of lyrical content (which is the main thing I look for in music), but the messages of the music are conveyed through the music -- all the electronic instruments, loops and samples come together in an artful arrangement. I'm still not crazy about it, but it is really a very good album."
4,Cute lil cd,"I have to admit, I did not want to like Moby at first. Some girl begged me to pop it into my cd player one day when this album was still kinda fresh. I heard Moby was dorky, but I actually liked some songs from here like Porcelain, Machete, GuitarFluteString, and the last one. I thought a couple songs from Everything is Wrong were decent too. Now I heard a live rave album that I downloaded by Moby from Audio Galaxy from a few years back... NOW THAT WAS GOOD. Moby should stick to that type of stuff because otherwise his stuff all sounds the same."
1,Just really terrible,"At first I kinda liked the album although it wasn't much to listen to . After a few more listens it just fell apart . Added to this was that the feeling you had heard all the songs before and by now it had really begun to grate on your nerves . It has the feeling of one song been sped up and slowed down and there are incidental words just thrown across it every now and then without thinking of the consequences . If you are a pop loving soul , then by all means buy this album ( if you haven't got it already ). If like Eminem ( which I also don't like but I think he's got a point with Moby ) then just don't listen to this . If you are looking for some really nice ambient dance music may I suggest The Orb or Boards Of Canada . They make music with a lot more imagination than you'll hear from this pile of waste"
5,truly superb mix of eclectic sounds,"I won't bore you with the same ecstatic praise as all the other fans of this album. One recommendation, though. Listen to track 14 with headphones. Loud, of course."
5,Moby's lastest is awesome!,"This is one of my favorite electronic albums. I rate it up there with Basement Jaxx ""Remedy"", Daft Punk, Prodigy's first 2 albums, Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, DJ Shadow, ect. Its a good album with alot of variety. Songs like ""Porcelien"", ""My Weakness"", are the best, but every song is great! I love this album, and I'm looking forward to furture Moby releases."
3,Funky Coffee Shop Music,"You know what you like but don't know if you'll like this album. As far as mainstream music goes, bands 3, 4, and 5 (conveniently provided for your listening pleasure here on Amazon) set the bar for this album. They are reminiscent of Enigma: driving beats, unintelligible lyrics, and kind of fun. But these represent only one style on the album which, especially toward the back end, has an experimental feel. For example, the album sets traditional music (in this case, blues) to a beat, similar to Enigma's treatment of Gregorian and Indian chants. There's hip-hop and a track with acoustic guitar. At one point, Moby (I assume) reads poetry to music while standing too close to the mike and turning pages. Some tracks are just tunes in a loop and very short. You will either find this a wonderful patchwork of creativity or an annoying mish-mash of sound bites. My copy is up for sale. I kept Enigma."
2,Vastly overrated,"I bought this CD and was struck by how souless it is. The disk is nothing special though it has its moments, mostly in the last third of the disk. I don't understand the hype. Look elsewhere."
1,Lousy clock but terrific customer service,"I bought this clock to go in our kitchen. I wanted a clock with butterflies and they are difficult to find. I paid about $30 for it and I could have gotten a better quality clock at Target for $5. The clock was poorly built,noisy,and we could see through the faceplate to underlying numbers that had nothing to do with the clock. The first clock I received stopped working after 24 hours. I emailed the company to request my money back. The owner of the company contacted us by phone and email to resolve the problem. We should have insisted on our money back but we thought the owner was being fair so we accepted the replacement. The replacement clock unsurprisingly was just as bad as the first and now we have it in our garage where we don't care if it is poor quality. I wish the company had better quality clocks since the owner was obviously concerned about making his customers happy."
4,Goes great with your favorite brew ....,Just good music with something for everyone... be prepared to sing along though
4,A good light for the purpose,The lamp was suggested to me by the Colorado Vision specialist here as I am having more and more trouble reading which I do at least five hours a day. The light makes it much easier to see. The only problem is that I have to sit very close to it. I like that you have to just lift the bulb holder to turn it on. You can carry it around easily although I haven't done that yet. The swivel base is handy so that it can be adjusted to whatever I am reading.
5,Improvement on a great product,"Purchased this lamp as a replacement for one that died after 8+ years of daily use. Even though the old one died (had to do with the lighting up when opening mechanism breaking) few lights compare for bright light on a compact footprint. And with the new swivel base in this model, it is even better!"
1,"burned skin, radiation?","I have had this lamp for about 9 months now and I was happy with it until recently. I spend my time studying 4 to 5 hours at a time on week days. Lately I've noticed that my skin specially around my hands start burning when I'm doing work under the lamp. I tried placing it further away but the burn slowly built up as long as the lamp was turned on near by. Once I made this connection I immediately unplugged it and started using my old regular lamp and what do ya know, no more burning skin. It's a shame because I really liked the quality of the light, kind of like sun light. Unfortunately it seems to carry similar radiation properties because the skin burn from the lamp feels just like a skin burn from the sun. I make all of my amazon purchases based on reviews so I felt like I had an obligation to let others know. I hope this helps someone."
4,Table Lamp,"I design jewelry and we set up at craft shows and psychic fairs, so we purchased 2 of the lamps. They are especially great when I'm working on a design. At the craft shows we put them on a shelf & the light spreads out on the jewelry below which works very well also. They are great when it comes to packing, sleek and lightweight. Since we purchased these a person had a LED light that you could twist around and use as a spot light, so I might have checked that out before I purchased these. Overall we at [...] are pleased with the OttLite."
5,Fantastic,"This light is in use as I type...I love it's compact design, great light and easy on and off with closing it down. Would definitely recommend this one!!"
2,does NOT attach to a wall,"I wanted to put some sort of full spectrum light over or beside my african grey parrot's cage. I bought this particular Ott light because it mentioned in the product description( in fact, in three places) that the lamp could be attached to a wall.It cannot be attached to a wall unless you want the light to face straight up. There is a keyhole type hole in the base of the light for a screw to attach it to the wall, but it is in the wrong place, and there is no way to change it. Wish I had known that, I would have bought some other type of light. Customer Service got back to my query right away, but said that they did not advertise using the light by attaching it to a wall. Hope they remove that part of their manufacturer's description. Otherwise, the light is bright and the fixture is good looking, it just can't be attached to a wall."
3,"Like the light, but the On/Off mechanism needs work","Really like the light from this lamp, but once the lamp is opened up and turned on, it will randomly turn itself off. The only help for this is to close the lamp and open it again. Would much prefer having an On/Off switch than have the lamp turn on when you open it."
1,no star was unavailable,"So bad. How can people write a book about movie this boring. This book will be more useful as kitchen towel than reading. Stronger than any sleep aid And It says he is faculty in PSU, I'm not sure about that I check and he comes out as waged stuff? I do not know what exactly it means but isn't janitor wage stuff too? So boring book."
2,robyn luvs syd,"interesting introduction to pink floyd's legendary ""missing"" founding memeber...who's most-often described in this dvd, as being ""beautiful"" yet there's not enough footage of this beautiful person, to satisfy my longing to learn more about him...but still worth seeing - if only, for the footage of robyn hitchock playing several of syd's tunes with such a heartfelt reverance that it inspired me to want to hear more from both of them!"
5,WON'T YOU MISS ME ? WE SURE WILL,"SIMPLY PUT, AMUST HAVE FOR ALL FLOYD FANS, WHO WANT TO GET THE EARLY FLOYD HISTORY FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THEMSELVES."
5,"Syd Barrett, RIP",Syd Barrett will be greatly missed. His whimsical songwriting style was unique and greatly influenced many famous musicians like David Bowie. This dvd is an essential purchase for those wishing to know about a genuis.
3,Provides dramatic play for preschool children,"My 3-year old daughter played with this toy as a prop for play stores, movie theaters, and any other scenario she designed which required buying and selling. The ATM-card scanner with its beeps was a big hit. It was well used for a limited time and worth the price. However, she was ready to move on to a calculating cash register with play money replicating real money within 9-12 months."
5,Substantial,AWOS was the first fiction novel that I read that I fell in love with the character. Emma Harte is a terrific heroine. One for the ages. I read it over 20 years ago and I have never found a novel to compare. It's not the easiest book to read and I often had to pick up a dictionary to search for a word. Nevertheless it is a wonderful rags to riches tale. I will never forget this book.
5,I'm a non-reader and couldn't put this book down.,"I watch more TV than I read, but Barbara Taylor Bradford has changed my thinking. I specifically am searching for her books now, because ""A Woman of Substance"" really grabbed me.I laughed and I cried and I was really shocked. When I got near the end of the book, I did not want the story to end.I could really feel the friendships with Emma and Blackie. They were always there for eachother through everything. They're relationship moved me.And the book was very inspiring for me as a woman. She didn't wimp out and kept fighting for what she wanted and what she earned."
4,A good read overall,"A great read. The author describes emotions and events well but sometimes the descriptions are crude and not those of a mature writer. Though I believe this was her first novel. I'm looking forward to reading her last one, for comparison of writing style."
3,A determined woman,"I didn't realise it was going to be such a long story ( Hard to tell the size on Kindle), but I did enjoy it once I got involved in Emma's life. I found the beginning of the story about Emma's adult life really got me in and when it switched to her early life I was annoyed because I wanted to know more. But I thought I'll read on because it will come back to where it left off. Little did I know it would be the whole book before I found out the rest.I have only read one other of Barbara's books - Letter from a Stranger. She is an excellent writer and certainly makes you part of the characters lives. I will be checking out some more of her books."
3,"Entertaining, but nothing special","I have been wanting to read a Woman of Substance for a long time. It actaully took three tries for me to get past the first couple of chapters. I felt this was another retread of Gone With the Wind, rather than anything new.I will admit that I finished the book and found it an ejoyable read, but had the following quandries about it. The opening scene seems hard to follow and offers little character development. It makes the book more confusing, rather than enhancing it. The story was forgetable. I had to keep remininding myself who the characters were. Finally, Emma, the protagonist is simply not a likable individual. I had little intesrest in her, did not feel her motivation was clear and founs her to be rather cold- not a heroine I enjoyed.If you likes the business aspect try Jeffrey Archer's As the Crow Flies instead. That is a far superior tale of one man's quest to create an ENglish shopping empire."
2,Lots of superficial information which should include more.,"Lots of names in this book, most I have no clue who they are. Tony Williams? Rolf Bjorling? Stephen Burks? I think another column explaining who these people are would wrap this book up nicely. Also, too many empty or generic causes of death. A little research would fill in these blanks (death cirtificates are public information)."
