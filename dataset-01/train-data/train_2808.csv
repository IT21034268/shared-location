1,Only received promises,Do yourself a favor and don't order from Andrew Christian. I can't believe Amazon has a relationship with these people.
4,A good all around starter book,"I was asked to coach my son's basketball team for the YMCA. Not being a big fan of the game, I needed a good introduction and skill fundamentals for third and fourth graders.The book covered all aspect for someone new at coaching basketball."
1,Typical Mormonism,The sad truth is that most Mormons don't even know what their religion is all about -- that is until they are too deep.
2,to: a reader from the rockies,"you are blinded by your religion and are not objective in your opinion. you are only lashing out at a woman who is not ashamed to call herself a christian. i too am a child of god. i have a question for you. in revelations, it is written that if anyone adds anything to ""this book"" (the holy bible) plagues described in the word of god will be placed onto him. what do you call the book of mormon?"
3,"Pretty at first, but short lifetime","I purchased this same frame from a local store rather than Amazon, but thought my experience was worth mentioning. It's very pretty and shiny when you first get it, but as others have mentioned it doesn't last long. In a few short months, salt and grime from the road took off all the shine and most of the chrome, leaving a very dull, cheap looking gray underneath. After a year, it's a nondescript gray frame that vaguely resembles palm trees.Another note, my hatch only had the two upper screw holes so I was only able to attach the top half of the frame+plate. I should have gotten a base plate or simply bolted the bottom holes together and put some weatherstripping foam behind for scratch protection, because after year two, one palm tree snapped in half completely.In short, the finish lasts a very short time if you commute on a highway or anywhere they salt the roads, and the product is on borrowed time anyway if you don't properly secure it."
1,ILLEGAL IN FLORIDA: YOU WILL GET PULLED OVER,"I bought this license plate frame about 6 months ago and loved it. The problem is, the palm tree leaves cover your registration sticker. About two months ago, I was pulled over and given a ticket for ""failing to display a registration sticker."" Slowly but surely, everyone I know that has this frame has been pulled over and have been forced to throw it away. Don't waste your money if you live in Florida."
3,Palm Tree License Plate Frame,Well these look great new but half way through winter both of them are pitted from winter salt & corrosion which leads me to believe that the Chrome plating is very thin...if no bad winter then they are great
1,"Looks great, but doesn't fit properly","I bought this for my husband and before I attempted to mount it on his car, I noticed that the palm trees completely covered the tags. Ended up returning the product."
3,Poorly done,These box sets seem to have been discontinued. There is little documentation or commentary. The selection is haphazard and the sound is poor. The only thing saving it is its voluminous length.
5,"gangsta pimpin fa sho piqua,ohio","this is definately a 5 compared to pimpin phanelia which is a 1 .he definitely came up on this one .explicit game is tight & can you feel me also.it is a must have for dru down fan,it's original.dd"
4,tight cut,i was feeling this song back in 97 when it came out.it's one of the best songs by Jamiroquai that they have done.very Stevie Wonder feel going on.a tight jam.the Mixes are worth checking into.
3,No stocking on this item,I ordered this item June 17 and it is Aug 2nd. No word from Amazon or anyone on shipping of this item. I've had this happen twice with Amazon. They list items that are not available. I am sure the product is great but the service from Amazon is questionable.
4,"Versatile Tool, However...",Use this tool often for installing door hardware and onsite lite millwork. The issue I have is the depth adjustment can change during use. The flip lock is handy but not as secure as it should be. As an owner of many Bosch tools this one could use a second look at the locking mechanism. Thats why I gave it a 4 rating.
4,So far so good,"I received this kit a few weeks back and admittedly have only had the chance to use it a few time, but so far it's been great and is really easy to use and manipulate for small projects. The included accessories truly expand your project options."
3,Almost a great improvement,"I have been a professional woodworker for 20 years. I had a Porter Cable Laminate trim kit that I loved, but it was stolen. I bought this because of the variable speed, detents in the tilt base, and more powerful motor. Unfortunately, the bases slip until you adjust the lock nuts, and it is a very fine line between too tight to adjust and too loose to hold. Worse than that, the darn thing is much louder than the PC kit. It is a good router, and comfortable to operate. Bosch routers are usually well crafted and bullet proof, so I suppose I'll get used to it. Wish I'd bought another PC, though."
3,Good router but accessories are a but lacking.,"This is a good tool but the regular base will not accept a standard router busing. For that you have to order the PR010 Round Subbase. In a kit with several different bases you'd think it would be included. The worst part is that once you attach the PR010 base the tool will not fit in the case!. This is frustrating; I don't want to take out 4 screws to put the router away, then reassemble and center the base when I want to use it again.So a good router with a poorly designed case and accessories."
2,Very average teen flick,"Predictable, production values average, acting the same. Perhaps it is the tennis theme that has the other reviewers so enthused. I, however, would not recommend this to others: the trajectory of the story line is so stereotypical of many teen movies out there with a lot better talent."
2,Cute but tedious,"Worth a rental, but not a purchase. Unless you like TENNIS and guessing how and when things are going to happen. Then, it's highly recommended."
1,Simple and Stupid,This was a rather sophomoric movie meant for 12 year olds. The acting is what you would find at a mediocre middle school play. It will put you to sleep.
5,Cool Movie!,"This was a fun, clever, and enjoyable movie. I learned a lot and my kids really enjoyed it. Great action. Will there be a sequel?"
5,Get This... You'll Like It,"Accurate, square and true right out of the package... nice quality for the very reasonable price paid. You can buy a much ""fancier"" unit, but unless you're made of money and just ""have"" to have the $70 you-know-who model, save your cash and buy other shop essentials with the money saved! I'd like to highlight another feature... the 'True Blue' level vial is VERY easy to read and is a nice feature. The blade's square-channel groove is a sign of a high-quality tool; it keeps the blade true to the stock. P.S.-- a drop or three of light machine oil on the blade will smooth the action, and help prevent rusting. Got this tool fast via Amazon, got the best price, and I'm very happy!"
4,Good Enough,"If you're not going to buy the $100+ Starrett this is probably your next best pick. It's nicely made. There are visible milling marks where you can see it has been cut to flat (presumably they could be lapped away if it's bothersome). Mine arrived slightly bent perpendicular to the axis that is square. I'm not sure if this was Empire's doing or Amazon's shipping. In any case I carefully pressed it back into shape and it should work fine for my purposes. The measurement marks are clearly printed and I like the almost matte surface finish of the ruler. On the square I had prior the edges of the ruler were not completely flat and the measurement marks were actually etched into the ruler. This combination square but Empire is much nicer and although somewhat of just an aesthetic, the blue coloring to everything is nice too."
5,Another Good Tool,I've had good luck with Empire over the years. They have turned out to be a nice middle of the road brand. The square appears very accurate and was essential to setting up my table saw. The price is right that I'm not going to cry if it gets lost or managed.
5,combination square,bought this to replace the one I bought 25 years ago. The ruler had tarnished and was no longer legible. This one item looks to be of even better quality. I look forward to it outliving me!
4,Not Quite Perfect,"Mine arrived with very light damage that did not occur during shipping. The ruler has a couple of light scratches, and the body had a scratch and chip out of the black finish.Otherwise, it is a nice product, and more than square enough for my thumb fingered projects."
4,Good Combo Square for the Price,"It's not a Starrett, but close enough for the money. I checked for accuracy and found it to be within a few thousandths of an inch over the length of the blade. The etched markings are clear and easy to read. Sliding operation isn't silky smooth but, again, for the money, it's just fine."
3,Not Bad,The Empire combination square is good for carpentry work but I would not recommend it for high-precision woodworking tasks. If you need a combo square for woodworking look elsewhere.
3,"Interesting book, unique historical perspective","Not a well written, but interesting book. Presents an account of notable historical clashes between whites and Indians from a man torn between the two cultures. For anyone interested in US Western history, it is worth reading."
5,Intriguing plot that is a must-read!!,"Bloody Point is a mystery packed with realistic, suspenseful action and believable characters!! Its faith-encouraging plot kept me reading from the first page."
4,Block Magic,I bought this book to have in my library and to date I have not really used the designs that are shown. Good book though.
1,Great fun !!!!,"I've only been quilting for a short time, and a friend showed me her copy of this book.I ordered it from Amazon right away and have used it,to some extent, on every quilt I'veproduced since. Sometimes I use the blocks to establish a theme, or to customize a quiltto the tastes or interests of the person who'll receive it. Great, fun results!"
2,Ham Fisted,The pianist seems intent on banging the keys too much and loses a lot of the subtlety. Liszt deserves better.
4,Beautiful Piano Music for a Cat Lover,"I checked this CD out of the library out of curiosity.Some of the pieces are so beautiful they made me cry.The little booklet that accompanies the CD has many pictures of the his beloved cat Mimi, and stories of his life. The touching stories in the booklet made me miss my cat so much. I had to the give the cat away before I moved and it was heartbreaking...The English translations of the Chinese titles and stories, however, are not very good. The second track, Xie4 Hou4, should be translated as ""Chance Encounter;"" and the fourth track, Xi1 Xi4, ""Playing,"" for some strange reason is translated as ""Crazy Ridiculous."" Hmm???"
2,Will not order again.,I thought these were very dry and had a bit of a bitter taste. I will not order these again.
4,A little dab,"Ironic that product so popular in my youth should prove to be exactly what my very dry hair needs at a much more advanced age. Just ""a little dab"" and this product helps keep dryness away, control my hair and add a touch of blue to eliminate any yellowing in the gray. This is not, repeat not, a greasy hair product. I highly recommend this product if not overused to yeild a ""greasy kids stuff"" look."
3,Good Hair CREAM,"I like this. It is medium texture, not thick or runny. This size of tube is great for traveling. Not a very big tube."
3,Great read for a novice of Jerusalem's history,"It must be a daunting task to have to squeeze about 3000 years worth of history into a 300 page book, but I thought the author did well in mapping the important events out and kept the book interesting throughout. Greeks, Romans, Persians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Turks, Brits..a large number of empires have held sway over Jerusalem which makes for a fascinating, if tragic and bloody, history. The story of the city is told from Jewish, Christian and Muslin perspectives in separate chapters which is a great approach. The only thing I thought was brushed over towards the end was the war of 1967, which I would have been interested to read more about to give context to the politics of modern-day Jerusalem. Other than that, I thought this book was a great introduction to the history of the city."
2,"Written by a ""hack.""","This writer attempts to portray 4 thousand years of history using broad generalizations. Serious subject matter and topics are generalized for the most part, with little or poor references. He also writes with a very strong bias, without much respect for genuine religious history, and writes strictly from a ""materialist and secular"" viewpoint. Many of his conclusions would be seriously challenged by any scholar in the various fields he attempts to enter. The style of writing is not bad, but unfortunately, he needs to get many of his ""facts"" straight. He is so off base on many of his conclusions, that it puts in question anything that he writes. It is a lousy piece of work."
5,Broken,The CD was in perfect condition and it arrived on time. I had this CD before and I played it so much until it wouldn't play anymore. I was excited when I was able to purchase a brand new CD for less than what I paid originally.
5,Great Quality,I think the quality is great. The bowls and plates are a little smaller than standard ones.
4,Corelle Dinnerware,"The dinnerware itself is great. It is a fun set and is wearing well with my children. Unfortunately, one of the sets that I ordered was very poorly packed and I could hear the shattered pieces moving around in the box before I opened it. I was amazed to see that it was the plates that were shattered and not the mugs. I did not expect this after reading other reviews about shipping of Corelle. It is a wonderful product but you will take your chances with the packing and shipping."
4,Great every-day ware,"Purchased as a gift for a newly-wed couple. Practical, stylish, and more than anything it's Corelle and we know that it will last for years and years."
3,Could have been better,"I have always loved the Corelle my grandmother had and was determined to only buy Corelle every day dinnerware because it's so light and indestructible. But, as with others who purchased this set, I was disappointed that the mugs were not Corelle. I also found many flaws in the pattern and wondered if I had been sold a ""second"". Apparently not. As with many things recently, I've found that the old versions far outshine the new. Could it be an overseas move? Corelle, get your act together."
4,Great buy,"I ordered two sets of these plates for when I first moved out of my parents home. My mom has an old set of corelle plates for when she first got married and I absolutely loved the quality (she still uses them to this day).They didn't arrive broken, they were well packaged but I did have a manufacturer's defect on one of the plates- it had a dent on the side. I have two problems with this set:1. The mugs- they are not the same material as the plates and eventually I noticed chips on the mugs from normal wear and wash.2. The color of the plates are not the same as the picture above. It's actually more of a light red as opposed to a deep red.Despite those two issues, the plates and bowls are great. By accident while washing dishes I dropped a plate on the floor in my tiled kitchen and it did not break, not even a small crack. I definitely think these sets are well worth the price."
3,too small,"The dinner plates are a good size, but the luncheon plates are hardly big enough for a sandwich to fit on. Also, the bowls are not big enough for a decent salad. The cups are the perfect size for a cup of coffee. Overall, even though I like the dishes, I am very disappointed with the size of the bowls and plates and would not have bought them had I know they were so small."
5,Lovely dishes,"I ordered two sets of these for my mother. She loves Corelle dishes because they are sturdy and so light weight. Such a nice alternative to the 5lb plates of many of today's ceramic sets lol. You have to work out just to stack them in the cupboard! = )These take up very little room and are microwave and dishwasher safe. They never scratch or fade and are consistently good dishes. I hadn't seen the red before and she really loves 'em! A great started set or the perfect light weight set for older people, or anyone in between really. I can recommend the set to everyone.Oh, one set did arrived smashed to bits but I got online to do an exchange and the new set was here in a 2 days, even before I had returned the broken one. Great customer service from Amazon!"
4,Exactly what I expected.,"I have three sons, ages 6, 9 and12. Corelle livingware is a great benefit for our active, and occassionally clumsy family. It doesn't break. I'm very pleased with both the product and the price. My only complaint is that I wish Corelle had included mugs made out of the same Corelle ware material, instead of stoneware mugs. The stoneware mugs are not easily stackable in the cupboard, and of course, they are breakable (though we haven't broken one yet)."
4,corelle dinerware,Would give these 5 stars because of price and corelle is great for everyday. Was a little disappointed because these are a true red. Very bright red while i was expecting a deeper red as shown on picture.
3,Stunningly average,"This set looks pretty good. The coffee cups are very good. The plates and bowls? Eh. Average construction, at best. They are light and easily broken. Oh, when they do break, they break into 100s of tiny pieces. Dropping a plate turns into an hour long session of hunting down the tiny shards of whatever cheap material was used to make the plate.I gave them three stars because they can actually hold food and drink...but wouldn't buy them again if I had a choice."
1,Do not buy this,I bought this thinking it was a nice deal from corelle and amazon both of which seem quite reliable. this set does not match the corelle standards whatsoever. the mugs are not made of the same material as the rest of the set. they do not even match the color of the plates and bowls at all. it looks tacky to say the least...i have returned the package and am awaiting a reimbursement now. do not buy this set.
2,Not what I expected,"The quality could have been much better. There are simply too many visible flaws on the bowls and plates (made in USA). The mugs, made in China, are flawless, but they are made of stoneware. They are heavy, not stackable, and easily break."
5,Always satisifed,"My family has always loved Corelle. They are light, durable, can be used in the microwave and never disappoint. I received this set as a gift & as always, love them! The design is perfect for either a modern or casual feel. The mugs are nice too, no problems with them. Great set!"
3,"Nice design, but beware","I bought 4 sets of 2 different designs to mix and match. Both had listed the size of plates/bowls as the same which I found to be incorrect, this design was smaller than the other design. I kept them as the cost of returning 2 sets would be close to what I paid for one set, a lose lose situation for me."
4,Great gift for my daughter,"My daughter has two young children, and I thought this would be a great substitute for her heavy pottery dishes. The kids can help her set the table, and the Corelle doesn't break if it accidentally gets bumped. Plus, my daughter liked the pattern."
2,Not worth it,Just got these and have washed them maybe 2 times. Most of the plates already have medium size white spots in the black area which has already came off.
5,Urban Red,"I do love this set and the color, but wish they would make the cups out of the same thing."
2,not as good as it looks in real,"it looks good in pictures, but looks not so good in real. Plus the quality of the glasses inside is pretty poor."
3,Love the Dishes... but not the mugs!!!,"I just received 1 of 3 sets of the Corelle Urban Red dishes I've ordered. I absolutely love the dishes.. and they are MADE IN THE U.S.A...WOOOO HOOOO!! But I, like the others have mentioned, am NOT in love with the coffee cups! Stoneware??? and made in China??? ick. I tried to cancel my other 2 sets.. I would rather order the extra plates and bowls seperately...but it's too late to cancel since they are in the ""shipping process"". I guess returning them is still an option.. just disappointed with the hassle that will entail!"
4,Great everyday set of dishes,This set was nice for an everyday set of dishes. I ordred the black rimmed set and the red. Odd thing was the black set came with all black cups and the red set came with white with a line of red trim on the brim of the cup. Looked ok but red cups would have looked cooler or the white with black trim. Not a big thing though- still nice sets of dishes for the price.
5,corelle dishes,We bought these dishes for our son and daughter in law.They can now get almost twice as many dishes in the dishwasher and not have to worry about scratches that so often happened with the china they were using.
4,"A parents view--good alternative to Barbie, etc.","This was given to my 3 year old daughter and I was so excited to see an alternative to the ""adult"" look of Barbie, Bratz, etc. These girls have rounder faces, thicker legs, and more realistic figures. She loves them just as much and they come with lots of accessories to dress them up! This is a great alternative if you feel Barbie, etc. is too old for your child."
1,Wee 3 Friends Dolls with Carrying Case - Lame! Lame! Lame!,"I HATE Wee 3 Friends! No one can dress that bad! When I saw the hats on the girls I thought it was the Snow! Snow! Snow! dolls! Those hats give me nightmares. How can you say Wee 3 Friends are better than Bratz? Bratz are bad role models? Are dolls supposed to be role models? NO!! Say they wear too much makeup? Look at the wee friends! They are 8 year olds wearing makeup and bratz are teens so I don't understand why you guys are complaning! What's wrong with the way Bratz dress? They are plastic! The clothes are velcro! The make up is paint! Stop saying they look like tramps, strippers and hookers just because they wear painted makeup and high heels! And strippers wear, uumm... thongs, did you ever see a bratz doll wear them? NO! Wee 3 Friends have tacky clothes. So STOP saying Bratz are bad role models and 8 year old girls who wear makeup are good role models. DOLLS ARE NOT ROLE MODELS!!! Thank you very much if you read this."
1,Bratz are Better!!!,"Some time ago I bought these Stacie dolls and what a mistake that was! They are like figures, and they just didn't appeal to me because they are not like the Stacies from before. They're too big to be Barbie's sister. Everything about them is so lame.Bratz are much better! These Stacie dolls ARE 8 years old, but have bodies like they're 12 if you know what I mean. Bratz are teens, and they look and dress SO much better! They are more exciting and pretty than these. Bratz are not street walkers,get over it.So, if you buy these Stacies you are wasting your time and money.I have Bratz now-including the TWIINZ!-and those are so much better and worth it, so there!!"
4,Great show!,"This great show got even better with color in this second season. Intriguing episodes are a ton of fun to watch. Even though the premise for some episodes were a bit corny, that is what makes them still fun to watch today.I like the packaging and format (single-sided discs - I don't care for those double-sided discs). Cover art, etc. is fine.As some have mentioned, there are *no* special features. Now, I'm not one that cares about hours and hours of special features. But I do miss the 15-30 second episode introductions that Robert Conrad did for the first season."
3,In Memory of Ross,"One of my favourite TV stars was Ross Martin. So it was a singularly enjoyable delight to be able to access some of his most memorable performances in ""The Wild Wild West"". I cannot believe the film-makers even considered the idea of ""updating"" this series with the mediocrity of Will Smith in the leading role! Thank the Lord for those who invented the Archival Section of the film genre!My deepest thanks to those who have made it possible to again view some of the best in television entertainment.January B."
5,The Wild Wild West - The Complete Second Season,Just as great as I remembered the show. It arrived when promised and was less expensive than I could find it nearby.
4,"Great show...wish there were some extras, though....","Season Two of the WWW is pure action/western entertainment, 60's style. The show seemed to delve deeper into a James Bond/Sci-fi vibe at times, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Can't get too 'out there' for me. The only drawback is the lack of extras, as I had gotten a big kick out of Robert Conrad's episode 'previews' from season one. Overall though, you can't go wrong if you're a fan. I find myself enjoying these shows at age forty-four just as much as when I was a kid of twelve or thirteen. Then again, that simply might be a 'maturity' issue.Thumbs up! Bring on season 3!!!"
5,DVD Review,This show has become a family favorite. My sons and husband are big into westerns. The boys are learning to appreciate the classic westerns from a different era. The shows are as good as I remembered as a kid. Quality of DVD is excellent also. Good entertainment with a good value.
4,Nice set; but it could and should have been better,"As stated by others, there are no extras on this set. it's pretty ""bare bones"" as most other releases go. There are no chapter menus; no subtitles and there is no; ""play all"" feature. I know there are a few cast members still alive besides Robert Conrad. Whitey Hughes; (The Night of the Vicious Valentine) the great stuntman (who occasionally acted on the show) would probably provide some interesting comments about the stunts on the series. Phobe Dorin; (Dr. Loveless's Anntoinette) it might be interesting to hear from her too. It appears that CBS is more interested in making a ""quick buck"" than paying homage to a series that made them great."
5,Steam punk rules OK!,"I am so pleased that the second series of ""Wild Wild West"" is available. This is an incredibly inventive and exciting sci-fi western series originating from the 1960's. The series is witty, sharp and action packed and features two engaging stars as well as guest starring a whole range of quality actors and actresses quite often playing power crazy geniuses out to rule the world.One of the best TV series of the last 40 years! Reviewers should not compare this series directly with the Will Smith remake. Personally I found them both engaging in their own way but to my mind the original was best. You are getting 8 hours worth of solid entertainment here."
5,Super Team,"I remember this show when I was a teenager. It was a great show, not your typical western though. It was great to find it on dvd to add to my movie collections. There are about 28 movies all in clear picture with beautiful colors."
5,The Wild Wild West- The Complete Second Season,It is SO nice to see old tv favorites coming out on DVD. This show is like re-visiting an old friend. The reproduction onto DVD is amazing and it is like time has never passed. Robert Conrad and Ross Martin made that show so believable and the opening scenes make you feel like you are there with them every week. This was a must buy in my household and I know others that loved the show will enjoy it also!!!
4,Classic early Cocteau Twins,"This EP contains four songs:Two versions of the title track, ""Laugh lines"" and the original version of ""Hazel"". This is the Cocteau Twins' only release where they invited a producer, it was Alan Rankin from British pop darlings Associates. But this didn't lead to a change in sound. All the tracks are rhythm-oriented, distorted and powerful. However, with bass player Will Heggie leaving the band after the release of this EP, it was time for a new direction, and the Twins happily found it with ""Head over heels""."
1,Idolos o Idotas,"Save your money! Being a loyal fan of Miguel Bose, I was aware of a new cd release due in Sept. of 2001. I read about ""Idolos de Siempre"" and located a copy. Just like I picked it up, I should have laid it back down. Any fan of M. Bose will already have the music, being that they are the original hits he first put out. The sound is very dated and a great injustice to the eighth wonder."
5,This book is important,I have read all of the comments that people have made. Even the ones from those pesky New Yorkers. I think they are way off base. This book is very basic because it was written for people who don't necessarily understand the Web but have to hire someone to build a Web site. This is important. Lots of people are trying to build businesses on the Web that don't know everything. They don't care about Wired Magazine. They are trying to figure out this medium and this book helps alot. I gave it to five of my clients. They said it was the best thing they ever read on the Web.
1,"Good concept, but the author strikes out.","I was pretty excited about the concept and title of the book, but the more I read, the more my disappointment grew. A beginner would benefit more from a half-hour conversation over a cup of coffee with a somewhat experience web developer. And if you have any web developement experience at all there are more useful books out there."
1,Not enough hard information.,"I found myself thinking that readers who have some background in outsourcing will not get enough information about the peculiarities of the web to be useful; nor would readers who have a web background, but not much management experience, get a reasonable amount of useful information from this book."
5,This reviewer is wrong,"Perhaps we all don't know everything. For those of us that need information about the Web business, this book is very informative. It has already helped me and my clients alot."
1,Not a book I would give my clients.,"In response to the previous reviewer, I think some people, including myself, have concluded that this is a mediocre book. It's as simple as that. Most of the negative reviews here have been succinct and on target. This isn't a book I would ask my clients to spend their valuable time reading."
4,"Great book, better reference tool.","I originally got this book for a technical writing class in college, and since I have gotten out of college into the working world, it's been a valuable reference. It's everything a good technical manual should be- clear, concise, easily navigated, and quality information. It avoids being too wordy and is great for anyone who deals with any kind of business writing."
5,Watch if you dare.,"Educate yourself and watch this. Sometimes I felt that the filmmaker kept his camera on a scene a little too long, but, know what? We deserve it."
5,No more cheap sunglasses!,"I just purchased this pair of sunglasses after trying for several weeks to live on ""cheap"" frames. I recently broke a pair of Ray Bans and lost my Smiths and didn't want to spend the $$$$ to replace them, but someone told me about Rudy Project glasses so I thought I'd give them a try. This is absolutlely the most comfortable pair of glasses I have ever worn - you don't even really feel that they are on. The lenses provide excellent clarity for driving and hiking and have a life-of-the-product guarantee. The interchangable thing is a plus, but not really the reason I bought these. Comfort, comfort, comfort + great lenses = no more headaches and poor driving vision."
5,Great Item,"Well made, durable, very easy to install. Excellent product. We replaced a much older version of this mailbox due to 20+ years of weathering. They last a long time."
4,Curious who this book is directed to..,"This is an excellent read detailing the failure of the US media to truly report the situation in Iraq. Mr Massing details many stories from independent reporters who have seen first hand the devastation that is happening daily which is never reported in the US.Although I enjoyed this book, I am curious as to who it is aimed at... those who are truly interested in world news never watch mainstream US media anyway. They know that if you want to know what is happening in the world, any US news media is the last place to go... Those people who do watch the US news media, probably do not care to know any more than what is already reported."
2,not so great,"I ordered a pair for my BF last Xmas and could not tell whether they worked or not since he does not ride very often. I decided to buy a pair for myself since my REI panniers practically fell apart from so much use. I read the review saying the bags were kind of large but anticipating a roadtrip I thought I would be fine. I was not. The bags are made of great material and love the exterior pockets but they are too big so when I pedal I hit the bags with my shoes, if I push the bags towards the back of the rack they are ""floating"" and on occasion they hit the spokes. What a disaster. Needless to say I returned the bags.I then decided to order the LaSalle model, but they are too small for my needs."
5,Inspiration to Faith,This book should be an inspiration to anybody trying to find a way to increase their faith. Read this book prayerfully and you gain new insight. John Hyde was definitely a unique man who had indeed lost himself in Christ. His was no doubt a life to be emulated.
4,One Hip Mama,"Growing Seasons offers a feast of gardening, aging family, movie biz, marriage and new parenting stories to keep you laughing and crying all the way through. The book truly is a gem. I was sorry it ended so soon."
5,Sonoma County Library,The author came to visit our book group at the Sonoma County Library today. She was just as sweet and sassy as her book! We loved her and Growing Seasons.
5,Perfect,This is the perfect stroller for our two kids. One is 2 and the other is six months. We get compliments and inquiries about where we purchased the stroller all the time.
5,A great start to the day,"Although I had to take the cover off to read the book on the train, it was a quick, fun read and a great way to start and end the 3 days it took me to read it. I found myself laughing several times at what the author had to say about the double standards of our society and that a lawyer was able to pickon his own profession and point out what's wrong with this world while making you laugh. I thought this was the ""South Park"" of law books. No one is spared."
5,Not All Lawyers Are Ambulance Chasers,"All Lawyers don't chase ambulances. Author, Attorney Megna goes to strip clubs and writes commentary on how the federal deficit could be illiminated if exotic dancers just paid their taxes. A very interesting book. The cover is somewhat bizzare, maybe offensive. But the book itself is funny, actually close to hilarious, and thought provoking. Short, easy read, hard to put down. If you hate lawyers, read this book. You may change your mind, or you may hate them even more. I'm still not sure."
2,Trashiest gay novel I ever read,RHINESTONE COUNTRY was - by far - the trashiest gay novel I've ever read. I could hardly put it down.
5,Brilliant Trash,"Better than anything Jackie Collins or Jacqueline Susane ever written. So trashy and tawdry, you keep turning the pages going from one lurid chapter to the next. Trash has never been so entertaining."
4,this is 1st book I have read of hers.,"I found the beginning a bit slow, but once I hit about page 65 I couldn't put it down. Now I will have to go back and read the 1st 2 brothers books. And by the epilogue it looks as if their half brothers story is next - I can't wait - he was sexier then then Joshua in this book!"
4,Where did this movie come from? It was GREAT!,"Never heard peep about it in the news, online or in previews at the theater but it was way better than the crap that Hollywood's been shoveling out onto the teen market -- finally a movie where the dialogue reflects how real young people really talk. Great story, greatt dialogue. And Seann William Scott is awesome, again. So is Timm Sharp and Dave Foley. Excellent film which I'm sure is on it's way to cult status. All grreat unheralded films go there.Rent this movie. you won't be sorry."
5,One seriously rad film,Just saw a bootleg and can't wait to buy the official version. Dave Foley is his funniest and Sean Scott is pretty funny too. Very Visual and the music and editing are the best I think I have ever seen/heard..Definitely a recommend.
3,smaller than what i thought,"My son had asked for this playmat for Christmas after some shopping online. He is obsessed with cars. So I got it as a Santa present, thinking this would be a good way for him to keep his cars in order and in one spot. But to dislike, this was WAY smaller than what I thought. Also there isn't as much detail in the picture on the mat also. He was a little disappointed, and has yet to really use it. He preferes the bigger mats and rugs to this item."
2,too small but found an alternative,I bought this item for my sons legos but it is so small. Those of you looking for something similar should check out Etsy's website for homemade versions of the same thing. One Etsy shop by Radical Thread Co. has a mat three times the size for $34.
4,SNARE SOME FUN,MY 10 YEAR OLD SON RECEIVED THESE FOR HIS BDAY AND LOVES THEM THE GAMES THAT COME WITH IT ARE CHALLENGING ENOUGH FOR A BEGINNING DRUMMER I RECOMMEND THESE IF YOU OR GRANDPARENTS ARE LOOKING FOR AN INEXPENSIVE GIFT(RELATIVELY) THAT WILL BE A HIT!!
2,Nice Try,"I sounds like a great idea, but the kids were bored fast and the flexiblity is limited when you have to keep the two sticks together with the cord in one mode. I think this is best suited for a pre-teen who is really interested in using it as an instrument rather that a toy. In our house (boys ages 7 and 12) they make great swords."
2,Frustrating,"My 8 year old wanted these for Christmas last year. By the time we figured them out....he was frustrated and bored. It's now been a year, and the only time he picks them up is to torture his younger brother (they make a good weapon)."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I got Air snares last year for Christmas. It was the thing I wanted the most, but not after I played with them. One of the sticks didn't work then I wasn't even able to play the games because the instructions were soooooo confusing. They will keep you Entertained for about 10 minutes if that! They are now lost somewhere in my closet! If I were you and was thinking about buying them for any age child I would reconsider that thought! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
1,Air Snares Dud Game,"Our twelve year old daughter asked for a drum set for Christmas. My husband and I weren't really into that idea for the usual reasons. To appease her appetite, we ordered this toy. She tried it out once briefly. It was relegated to the closet (I think), and has never seen the light of day again.It would have been more accepted if some of the noises it made could be compared to an actual drum set. If there were a setting for this (instead of human screams and breaking glass), we never found it. But then it only held her attention for minutes.As for durability, the physical product didn't break, but the toy itself had such a limited life that it's hard to call it lasting."
2,FRUSTRATING!!,"I thought that this would be a great toy that my 7 year old would love. WRONG! Neither he nor I can really play the games -- the air snares just seemed to respond arbitrarily. Plus you have to ""drum"" with quite some force to activate them. The toy ended up making him scream & cry -- not what I'd had in mind at all.Now, my 2 year old thinks they're pretty great. She likes everything that makes a noise.Avoid this toy."
3,Lost user manual / instruction sheet,My 10 year old daughter really likes this toy. It's a lot of fun. But I agree that it is impossible to play without the user manual/instructions. We lost the user manual but I just called Mattel and they sent it to us electronically. In the US: 800-524-TOYS (800-524-8697) In Canada: 800-665-6288. They also said they could mail it to us if we had problems getting from our email. Mattel was VERY helpful!! Don't give up on this toy. It can be really fun if you take the time and use the instructions!
1,Overpriced chopsticks,"My son begged and begged for these for christmas, and he was so disappointed when they came. They are impossible to use, with no instructions, and are now located in the bottom of the toybox. I wouldn't waste your money!"
1,Disappointing,My son and I were very disappointed. I should have kept the old hit stix for him. They were way more fun than these. My son couldn't even play a tune on these like the Hit Stix. Save your money!
3,Disappointed to say the least -,"I bought two pair for my 5and 6 year old girls - they have more fun pretending they are microphones - they are much more limited and flimsy then I had been led to believe. Not that great a value for the $$ - if you don't get annoyed by tinny off beat sounds and you have a child who does not bore easily, these are great."
1,don't waste your money,I got these for my 9 year old son last year for Christmas. We couldn't figure out how they work. They were very frustrating. Would not recommend them at all.
2,Not impressed at all!,"First of all, the game was quite loud and irritating.Second of all, there was too much play along with the built in synthesizer and not enough true drumming.My son quickly lost interest in in when he realized that the sticks were ""playing"" more than he was.Too bad, we had high hopes for it."
1,Big Disappointment,"This item didn't do what it said it would do. It says you can play music in mid-air, but only one stick would play and the other wouldn't. Also, you can't play your own tunes, just the ones that you press a button and they play it for you."
1,THIS SUCKS!,"These things suck! They don't even work if you use it in the air... you have to actually hit something with it and only one of them works but it still makes really annoying sounds and I thought it would help me practice drums when I'm not at home but it didn't work one bit. Plus they don't even have a sound on it that actually sounds like a real drum. Only noises like breaking windows, cows mooing, and cats screaming... PLEASE don't buy these because you'll only waste your money and waste yuor time trying to figure out how to work it..."
1,this toy is a waste of money!,"The reason it is no fun is cause it doesnt have any instructions! We just pressed a bunch of buttons until we finally found the game! Then when we found the game it didnt even let him play! It just did a rythem then kept going and all he would get was boo!!!The reason it is not durable is because the rubber ends bend easily!It wont even make a good noise! After about 5 times of banging in the air to get it to make a sound his arm was too tired to try it again. I bought these for my 12 year old kid he hated them cause they were so frusterating, trust me any 5-14 year old will hate these and throw them in their closet like i did. These are horrible!!!! Dont get them!"
5,GOOD...,"THE DRUMS ARE GOOD!YOU COULD PLAY 4 DIFFERENT SOUNDS;SNARE DRUMS,LIGHTNING,BASS DRUMS, AND SYMBALS.I LOVE IT. ZELDA RAPLINK HAD THE POWER BUT i HAD THE MIND"
2,Disappointed Would-Be Drummer,"Unfortunately, this product arrived without any instructions, leaving the recipient to fumble thru a series of 8-10 buttons with cryptic markings and no clear correlation to what function they play. Playing the ""air"" is not particularly effective, and playing something as soft as a pillow results in a thud from contact that's louder than the effect produced by the sticks."
1,don't buy this ........... save your money!,i used this toy about once........ cauz it stinks! you can't even play them in the air because u have to actually hit something. I hate this toy!!! don't buy it!
4,good job making this toy,i think that it is a amazing toy and that im glad my mom bought this toy for me
1,difficult to program this toy,"There are lots and lots of buttons on both sides of each drumstick. The programming and button pushing that you have to do in order to make this toy work is excessively complicated. If you ever lose the paper instructions that come with this toy, you are doomed. You will never figure out how to operate the controls for this confusing toy unless you read the instructions every time you turn it on. Also this toy ships with only half of the required batteries. When you get it you have to put in the rest of the batteries that it needs. Avoid this product."
1,Waste of money,"My 8 year old son requested these for his birthday. What a disappointment! They do not work easily, instead you must thrash your arms in the air to get any sound out of them. My husband even had trouble trying to get them to make drumming noises. My son gave up playing with these after about an hour of trying to make them work, and has never had any interest in picking them up again."
2,Boring,My daughter is a percussionist and is always tapping pencils and drumming on her legs. I thought this would be fun for her. She didn't like them at all. Should have just bought real drum sticks.
4,"Great, particularly for professionals","The book includes some great tips about working in the DIR model for kids with speech and language delays, and autism. It is heavy going though, and would be more useful for a professional than a parent."
3,Trying too hard??,"A disappointing outing for the Adderley Quintet, recorded live at the famous Hermosa Beach, CA, Lighthouse. Too many of the tunes are played way too fast, leaving little substance to them. Even the best cut, ""What Is This Thing ..."" is taken too fast. These performances should have been better."
3,"Nice product, but careless work by the factory needed correction","-- The shipped base column was for a narrower model of mailbox and did not fit. A very helpful woman at Step2 support (1-800-347-8372) arranged to ship the correct base and have the wrong one picked up by FedEx.-- Had to trim some plastic flash off the bottom of the rear door so it would close (door not properly fitted to the box).-- Had to add three metal washers above the rear door latch magnet to lower it to match the door metal plate.-- The magnets seem weak, thinking about getting better ones if there's a wind problem.-- Once installed, the box seems sturdy and looks nice. Would I buy another? Maybe, but I'd shop around first."
2,Colors not accurate,"The color shown in this picture is nothing like the real thing, it is much brighter. The ""lace"" on top is a really bright blue, kind of cheap looking."
1,Internet Exploder required???,"Come on... that's rediculous. Microsoft is one of the most anti-java companies out there, and all they can do is base their included CD-ROM on this?What a waste."
2,Not very sturdy,"Ordered this as a medical bag/laptop bag.But the latches/hinges are very flimsy and can bend very easily.Lots of sharp edges and metals.It is a beautiful bag but not very practical for me.Had to return it, regretfully."
1,Tedious,Terrible. This book is poorly written and very difficult to understand. It takes very simple concepts such as pH and makes them extremely difficult. Do not recommend.
5,excellent textbook,This excellent textbook has the best illustrations I have seen. Many illustrations are done for student learning that do not appear in other similar texts. This book helped me a great deal pass my boards. It is very up to date and very readable.I have trouble understanding other's problems because I found this to be such a wonderful text. I wish other texts on related subjects could reach out to beginning students like this one did.
1,Hard Read,I use this book for my Patho class. I had a hard time reading it. It is very dry and it is hard to get through the chapters. If you have to buy this book for ur class I would recommend that u get another study guide book for the times when u just cant understand what the book is talking about.
4,The Wackness: dope enough for your money.,"I definitely enjoyed The Wackness. The cast was superbly chosen, but some members were underused. I especially enjoyed the performances by Josh Peck (Luke) and Olivia Thirlby (Stephanie). The script was good, but not revelatory. The lighting in the scenes were brilliant. It's not a new favorite, but I would recommend it to my friends if for nothing else but the great soundtrack and the underlying tone it has about growing older."
5,the wackness review,this movie has a good feeling to it.escape life to classic hip hop and the streets of New York City
4,Lies and Alibis,"Funny movie, underrated. A lot of good stars inside with a pretty cool twist. I'd buy it."
5,The Wackness,"This movie is one of my favorites. First time I saw it I did not have very high expectations because the lead was being played by a Nickelodeon star, but Josh Peck did a fantastic job. Ben Kingsley, like always delivered a spectacular performance. This movie makes you think about life as a whole. It is also accompanied by a head bobbing hip-hop soundtrack, with songs performed by artists such as Craig Mack, Krs-One, A Tribe Called Quest, The Notorious B.I.G. and many more. I would definitely recommend this movie as a great watch for whatever mood your in."

4,I CAN'T LIVE IN JERSEY,"The story line is the ""Wackness."" Luke (Josh Peck) is a coming of age drug dealer in New York. He sees a psychotherapist, Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley) who he swaps marijuana for sessions. Dr Squires has a failing marriage to his wife (Famke Janssen). Luke is an outcast who is smitten by Stephanie (Olivia Thirlby) the step-daughter of Dr. Squires. Luke is attempting to sell drugs at an accelerated pace to prevent his family from being evicted and exiled to New Jersey.The film has its cookie characters in drug users (Mary-Kate Olsen, Jane Adams) and is filled with truisms which adds boredom to a dialouge already burdened with too much seriousness. While the situation is comic, the dialouge fails to keep pace. The characters lacked a certain amount of believability. The film got rave reviews, perhaps due the original plot and underlying themes, but as a comedy it won't have you rolling on the floor. 3 1/2 starsPARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity."
2,Company Disatisfaction!,"Now I ordered 4 of these 1 lb. containers of bitter melon powder. About 80 or so dollars. Believing that my purchase would arrive via USPS, as I was told; there's no worry. My wife and I move frequently and the change of address system now is pretty efficient. However, after two weeks, I get an email from the company that UPS is going to handle the delivery for some odd reason. Now we have a problem. We received several emails from Raintree; that when read sounded like I was being scolded like a child. I finally have my bitter melon, it's the 28th of January. Over a month after I placed the order! I would have been prepared if I knew they were going to switch carriers on me. But telling me to basically make up my mind, product or reimbursement; and then be ""asked"" if I would send an 8 dollar check for reshipping is laughable."
4,Haunted Women,"This is a truly excellent collection of ghost stories by women. There is something for every taste: stories amusing, tender, unexpected, and/or truly bone-chilling. The stories, which range in length from a few pages to novella, are arranged in chronological order; and the focus is by no means only on women.Come a dark and stormy night you will be glad to have the company of this compendium of pleasant horrors."
3,'fine imaginative storytelling with a superb command of the supernatural',"34 stories by 20th century women writers, from the Edwardian (Edith Wharton, E. Nesbit) to the recent (Fay Weldon, Angela Carter). A lot of the names will be familiar to those who have read the Virago Classics.I can't say I was exactly scared - maybe none were long enough to work up a state of terror in the reader (try Sarah Waters' 'Little Stranger' for that!) But they were certainly diverse and interesting, featuring a host of settings, from ghostly schoolmistresses, poor night-nurses seeing awful things, wronged women, a lady with a unicorn and even a haunted saucepan."
3,Pleased I bought it.,"I found this an enjoyable tale, but you have to take it for what it is - not a scholarly treatise, and not even very credible, but an entertainment. There are far too many errors of spelling and grammar, and a phrase such as 'anally retentive' in the middle was a little bizarre. (In its Freudian meaning, nothing to do with sex) Sometimes, there were chunks of abstract musings from what almost seems like a different author. No mistakes in those chunks, but also, I thought, quite unnecessary.Don't expect anything more of this book than an entertaining fantasy, and you will not be disappointed. Over-priced for what it is - I've reviewed far better books at half the price, and yet it was a fun entertainment, and I did read to the end, only skipping a few convoluted bits of history now and then."
4,Sheer genius,"Milosz is magic- these English translations of his originally Polish works resonate with intelligence and beauty. These poems brim with such gorgeous music, you'd never guess they were translated. See especially, ""A song for the end of the world."""
5,Phenomenal,"I highly recommend this collection -- Czeslaw Milosz is perhaps my favorite poet. His haunting, lyrical style speaks so much to the beauty in humanity. If you're even thinking about purchasing this collection, do it."
2,Disappointed,"Despite being (allegedly) written - in part at least - by a professional card fraud gang, the book offers only very basic information on both the way card fraudsters operate, and how they can be stopped.The book is OK for a small merchant, with little credit card experience or knowledge. However, it is a waste of time for anyone with a reasonable understanding of the topic.It is also ridiculously over priced. Although having 53 pages, please note that:- a number of pages are either completely blank, or alternatively, contain only one small paragraph- The book is of relatively small dimensions- The font is quite largeIf you gather from this that you don't a lot for your money, you are 100% correct."
2,"Read the digital version, not a huge fan, but some good points","I am a fraud investigator myself, and read this book digitally of course, 100 dollars for a paperback novel, with pages not even filled with text was ridiculous to me. Reading this novel there are some good points, and some good information in regards to how cards are compromised, a small bit of what all the possible fraud trends. Where I can agree that some of the techniques to prevent fraud may inconvenience customers, he fails to also mention what companies such as CyberSource (Where I am employed) has actually saved for the merchants because of techniques that we use, that a chunk of are not listed in this book. These very vague techniques that are listed are a small part of a huge picture. Good info, but bulls*** as far insulting those companies who work with knowledgeable and experienced fraud analysts to locate trends and prevent customers and merchants from losing money because of fraud patterns that were detected by our staff."
2,nice but couldn't figure out how to run the fm section,"The sound is OK, the display is a bit small to display mp3 info. But the most challenging thing about this unit is to try to tune an FM station. I admit this is my daughter's boom box, and I didn't have the manual. BUT should you need the manual to tune an FM station? I have an advanced degree in CS, but it didn't help me with this product."
2,buttons are a little stiff,I bought this as a gift for my mom (she's visiting right now) & she's complained that the buttons are a little stiff & the cassette door doesn't open & shut too easily. She isn't too impressed...
5,Fantastic setup for things to come,"My friend got me interested in The Illuminati a while back. So I went out and bought three books: The Illuminatus Trilogy, Schrodinger's Cat Trilogy and The Earth Will Shake. I just started reading the books starting with The Earth Will Shake and I must say that it is fantastic. I haven't read the other two volumes yet but I have the feeling that the entire point to this book was to introduce the characters and Wilson does it very well. He is definatly building up to something huge. I can't wait until I get a hold of the other two volumes."
2,Textbook,"The title is good, but this is a fairly boring book. Had it as a textbook in seminary, and only remember one or two things from it."
4,Very much like a Christian L.L. Western.....,"When you combine a fiesty, independent 30 year old woman in the west who also happens to be a photographer-- with a handsome gentleman with plans for an isolated ranch, you are in for a wild ride.Ollie as I called her, fought with the best of them, often freeing herself and others from the frightful gangs of outlaws which terrorized their towns. She was always ready.One of the highlights of the book occured when Ollie was commissioned to do a 24 picture series titled Women of the West and her quest to obtain those pictures...the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, all colors and ages.....what an adventure.Much action, much emotion, just enough religion and love cause this book to hold one's attention clear to the last few pages when I wanted to throw the book across the room I was sooo disappointed. More, please."
4,Overall good construction,"Kneeling pad not attached very well, uses 2 small pieces of velcro that have already come unglued from the seat, otherwise good quality garden product, also works well as shower seat for much cheaper than dedicated shower chairs"
4,Waited too long,"Wonderful product for use as a kneeler when putting bedding plants into patio planters. Just waited too long to buy one, but very contented with having this product in hand when now when needed."
2,OK but not as good as the Garden Rocker,"THis is simply a bench. I was much happier with the Garden Rocker, which is ergonomically designed has a more comfortable seat, and tilts with the body. It is ingenious!!!"
5,saves my back!,I love this bench/kneeler. Just the right height and saves my back! Easy to cart from one garden spot to the next. Sturdy but light.
5,Can't garden without one.,"I have one in each of my homes. My last purchase was given to an elderly neighbor who had borrowed mine. He is thrilled with it and wants to purchase one for his friend. Whether you are young or old, it is an invaluable tool. I have purchased others but none compare to the sturdiness of this one"
4,Step 2 Garden Kneeler,I purchased this kneeler recently and have found it to be great - light enought to move around but sturdy enough to take my weight! It really saves my knees and makes it easy to do weeding etc in the garden
4,Makes a great shower seat as well.,"my wife broke a toe about three weeks ago. The first week she couldn't put any weight on the foot.I had bought her this gardening stool last year and it turns out its great for the shower. Very light weight, very stable, the right height and its well made so that the water doesn't even get in the hollow plastic moldings as I feared it might. After allowing to dry a bit, I can take it out of the shower and it doesn't slosh or drip at all from trapped water.PS its also meant to be used upside down (for kneeling while in the garden) and there's a removable knee pad velcroed to the underside we removed for this use.PPS Its a OK garden stool and kneeler as well."
5,She couldn't do without it,"My mother lives for gardening, and is out playing in the dirt as soon as the weather allows. She'll be turning 90 on her birthday in October, so this kneeler has been an enormous assist to her, not only in kneeling, but as a bench. She's been using it for a month (ever since Mother's Day) and wishes it had come along sooner in her life."
4,Off the dirt,"We purchased this to use at our beach house, No worry about rusting. We have a more expense kneeling/seat at our home, which we really like. The beach unit was less expense and time will tell if its just as good for the wear."
4,lightweight and sturdy,"It is easily carried and comfortable kneeling. The cushion does come out perhaps too easily. You can only use the ""kneel"" one direction. It is sturdy enough to assist one to a standing position. [I am in my eighties and don't get up and down easily]"
5,Great kneeler and seat!,This garden kneeler is great for getting down to the gardening jobs and great for helping to get back up. I use this constantly and just love it.
4,GREAT FOR THOSE WITH BAD KNEES!,"THIS GARDEN KNEELER IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY, I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS IF THE COMPANY WOULD FIND A BETTER SOLUTION FOR KEEPING THE PAD IN PLACE. I STILL LOVE THIS THING THOUGH, IT IS VERY HANDY IF YOU HAVE BAD KNEES LIKE I DO BUT STILL NEED TO TEND YOUR GARDEN"
5,Works Perfectly for My Aprilaire,"My wife and I had never changed the old pad in our whole house humidifier. I figured it was time, given the crusty accumulations on our old pad. Before we changed the pad, I have to say that the efficiency of our humidifier wasn't as good. It seemed to take days for the humidity in the house to go up when I would adjust the humidistat. After changing the old pad, the efficiency was noticeably better right away. Adjustments resulted in changes to our household humidity in less than 24 hours. If you are like me and you are wondering how much of your pad actually gets replaced, you will find that the pad in your humidifier actually has a black frame that comes apart. This is the frame that has the water line attached to it. Once you open the frame, you can discard the mesh metal pad and insert this new pad. It will fit perfectly. I'll be coming back for more of these in the future, and I would highly recommend them to anybody."
5,Works the same,"The BestAir water pads work just as well as the original Aprilaire pads that I have had for my whole house humidifier, and cost less too."
4,matches the factory filter it replaced,"seems to be working just fine, i would buy this product again, with eight more words in this review it will save."
5,Great Value,This humidifier pad was the correct size I was looking for. The price was significantly lower than other web sites I checked. I will reorder again when I run low.
5,Humidifier Water Pads,"Good buy. Order at least 2 like I did because of the shipping charges. With 2 filters and the shipping charges, I still would have only been able to get one IF purchased locally for the same price. Fits in place just like the old one. I would do it again....in a couple years, they say to replace annually."
4,A very tidy concept,"I purchased the Pearl JG-16 to convert a Premier 16"" X 18"" floor tom to a bass drum. It has done the job nicely and looks very tidy and compact. Please note you will also require the Pearl ISS and BT-3 components to complete the conversion project. It cost me around 30 in total to convert my floor tom to a bass drum. Apparently Pearl made this product with musicians into Jungle music.....? Any way i use it for jazz/be-bop/blues and the likes. I use a fairly small 3 drums 3 cymbals kit and it works well for me."
4,Count your lugs first,"If you are converting anything other than a Pearl floor tom the Jungle Gig adapter will not simply snap on and fit perfectly. For my Yamaha16x16 the recommended Optimount adapter could not be made to fit. The 16""version only works on an eight-lug rim. My solution was to take the BT-3 off the Optimount and attach it directly to my tom. Drilling and screwing required. If you are willing to work at fitting it to your non-Pearl tom you will have a sturdy dependable little kick drum that converts back to floor tom mode in a jiffy."
4,Sturdy and built to last but......,"the JG16 is a great adapter for any body who wants a small kit for travel or when playing in small clubs that wont permit having a standard set on stage. When i first got the package, i was ready to hook it up on to my 16 in floor tom but suddenly realized a missing piece of the puzzle. apparently the foot pedal base of the JG16 needs another contraption that holds the base's rod in place to support the drum. A standard BT-3 bracket by pearl is what i got which ment that i had to drill a hole into my drum :). but if you don't want to do this, you can also buy an ISS suspension system that comes with the BT-3 bracket so that the bracket is still floating but more importantly, you dont damage your drum."
3,"Dragons are cool, but the riders are chocking hazards","The toys look cool and the action feature on the Dragon is cool. However, the rider figures are poorly done. They are far from durable and break into pieces way too easily. The package says the toys are for 3 and up. Since the rider figures, which are small to begin with, break apart so easily, I'd have reservations about giving this toy to anyone under 8 years old."
4,Good value for the cost.....,"I found the overall performance to be good. I see the problem of the bushings falling out of the straight edge jig still exists. Maybe Jet doesn't read these reviews. Super glue fixed that. The water collection system falls short, especially while grinding planer blades. The stone came ""factory trued"" but still needs a little truing, definitely need to order the Truing Tool when you purchase the unit.All in all I feel it does a good job for the price."
1,Go with Tormek,I bought this tool and had a problem with the motor. Jet customer service was no help and no one would fix it even thought the problem was right out of the box. I thought I was getting a deal with the Jet but now would gladly spent the extra money for the Tormek. I'm a timber framer so having sharp chisels is my life. Will gladly go back to the Tormek.
1,Not as shown on Amazon,I ordered the Jet Slow Speed Sharpener as a Christmas Gift for my husband and this week (5/13/2012) he set it up only to discover that the base that was pictured with the unit on Amazon was not included. IMHO this is false advertising. I chose to order the unit as pictured because it included the base. IMHO the seller should sell what they pictured. I've contacted the seller and so far they fail to supply the missing base.
1,Pour Quality all around,"I have owned a Jet sharpener for 5 years. It has burned out the motor. The shaft that holds the wheels on is not stainless, and water from the wheel has rusted the bearings. The motor would lag and after several years it has failed completely. I am buying a Tormek T7 and not a Jet.By the way Jet was of no help with service on this item.... I was unable to get new bearings or a shaft for the machine earlier.Bottom line, you get what you pay for, and this is not a quality tool."
4,Gives Tormek a run for its money,"Like others here, I spent a lot of time comparing the Jet to the Tormek. I recently was able to get the Jet for roughly half the price of the Tormek, and have been using it for a few months now. All the comments and gripes about the Jet are mostly true, IMHO, but are pretty minor when put in the context of the price differential. Sure, a Mercedes is a great car, but a Honda Accord will get you to the same place for a lot less. If the Tormek were a couple hundred dollars cheaper, I might have gone for it, but the Jet will probably last me the rest of my life with money left over for wood."
4,Flag,I was very happy with the United Kingdom flag pen. It was just as discribed and arrived ahead of schedule.
4,Good intro,"For someone on an initial exploration of the world of trance / techno / uplifting dance music, this is definitely the CD to buy. The artists are relatively unknown, which is why the CD sells for so cheap, but the music is still very intense. Each song has a rather long intro, and this allows for climatic tension and crescendos. The only drawback is the pause between cuts - there is no smooth mix from one song to the next. Ultimately, this is the best and cheapest CD for the techno virgin."
3,Who in the world really WANTS this much Play Doh?,"This is the gift that you give to someone's kid that you really dislike - - imagine, 50 different colors of Play Doh to pick out of the carpet - - YIPPEE! Truthfully, who really NEEDS this much Play Doh?Does anyone really have the room to store this much Doh? I read other reviews that said the containers are smaller than what the pictures suggest. Could you imagine storing 50 regular sized cans of Play Doh?"
1,Not a good choice,"This product is not nearly as good as I remember. As a parent, I avoid this like the plague.First of all, let's be honest, it stinks. I forgot how nauseating this product really smells. Yuck! Second, it's messy. It crumbles and falls apart easily. Therefore it ends up everywhere. I.E. on the table, floor, chairs, carpet, etc. Third, the colors do not mix well together, no matter how much you work them. Finally, once it dries out, it's garbage. Children tend to never put the lid on properly, so it has a short shelf life.Yes, I'll admit that it is fun to squish, mash, and make various shapes out of this. However, modeling clay is a much better choice. It lasts forever, because it does not crumble or dry out. It does not smell great either, but it smells better than this stuff."
5,very good product,"We have been using Source Micronutrients for several years. We noticed the difference in our horses coats within 30 days, and they have been in incredibly good condition ever since. People are always asking how we get them to shine so much."
2,Disappointing,"After reading about Schaeffer's Last Chancers in the Imperial Guard codex, I got my hands on a copy of Kill Team. I enjoyed Gav Thorpe's Angels of Darkness, so I had faith that Kill Team would live up to the same standards. It did.Annhiliation Squad did not. The beginning is a bit disorienting and there is a noticeable lack of character development that made the previous novel interesting. Much of the plot development is meandering and monotonous. The epic backdrop of the 3rd Armageddon War can't even invigorate this lackluster story. In the last 3rd of the book there are some intriguing twists that immediately spiral into a miasmic convolution that abruptly terminates like a piece of rotten fruit hitting a concrete wall. You read the last sentence and turn the page, thinking there will be another paragragh or new chapter and realize that the story is just ... over!I won't speculate why it ended the way it did, but it was disappointing."
3,impressive indie pop with its own voice,"The main artist, Jim Huie is usually associated with various projects which have fallen in the categories of garage or even ""paisley pop."" However with this release he flexes his own vision and ""voice"" with some intriguing and ironic songs. There's a lot of ""production"" going on here, but it's of the do it yourself type, not formulaic ""what everybody else is doing"" kind of production. So this should age well. Cool contributions from some hip special guests. hooray for indie artists like this."
5,Great pop music!!,"Jim Huie is not only a great musician but he is one of those very crucial people who helps put it all together for the rest of the world. He writes beautiful jangly pop music and brings excellent guest stars into the loop like Steve Almaas and Mitch Easter. With titles like ""She Married a Loser"", ""Love is Not Linear"", and ""How to do Everything RIght"", Jim reveals a great deal of thoughtfulness and a sense of humor in addition to the great music."
1,Garbage!,"HATCHET was a 5 star movie and I enjoyed every bit of it, but this sequel HATCHET II was a huge let down. I was looking forward to seeing Danielle Harris lead this and Tony Todd's expanded character, but they couldn't save this movie from the awful chewed up bubblegum of Crowley's monster. I wasn't scared, didn't laugh, wasn't grossed out, wasn't anything and I couldn't wait till the movie finished. I even thought I'd like it more after meeting the cast at the latest Fangoria Convention in Burbank last year, but they had to know what a piece of garbage they made here. Sorry Mr. Green...this movie sucked!"
3,I wish I could only give 2 1/2 stars (AT MOST),"Unfortunately,I HAVE to agree with most of the other reviews,what a PIECE!! Man,I was so stoked for this to finally come out,and for WHAT? To me,it seemed SUPER generic compared to the first(which I LOVED btw)I really hope the director(Adam Green)reads some of these reviews,because he really needs to take note.Not sure exactly what went wrong,but wow..what a let down.After all the hype of ""we used 500 gallons of blood on this one,compared to only 55 with the first.."" Come on,ANYONE can splash some fake blood on a wall or tree..maybe I saw a ""cut"" version..but to me,there seemed to be not nearly as much gore as the first,and when there was?,it was completely FAKE looking!Better luck next time(and you KNOW there WILL be a next time)Too bad."
1,Rushed sequel,"First I want to say that I really enjoyed the first film and was looking forward to the second film. Bottom line was that the story was rushed and didn't make any sense. We were given more of the background of the character however the twist at the end didn't make sense and I saw it coming. I knew that this movie was going to bad from the first kill, which didn't look real, it looked fake and plastic.The fun and spirit of the first film is gone. I was extremely disappointed and I really wanted to like this film. I would recommend watching it if you can see it for free otherwise don't waste your time or money."
1,Total Borefest! Same movie remade...,This movie was terrible... its basically a remake of the first one in terms of introducing something new.... it was the SOS.... totally a waste of money.
5,Stop The Spoilers You Di*ks!,"In my opinion this movie was great! High body count, low plot, and tons of over the top gore. My only real issue is with the D Bags on Amazon who feel the need to ruin the movie for those of you who have yet to see it. Take my advice, check out the movie and be careful which reviews you read because there seems to be a lot of morons out there that think they must give away the movie in order to tell you about it. SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR OTHER CONSUMERS YOU INTOLERABLE IDIOTS!"
2,Not very good,"I love B movies. I understand what the directors are trying to do and the statement they are trying to make. Movies like Thankskilling, The Feast, Girls Gone Dead, and even the first Hatchet were all excellent B movies. But this one was crap. It almost tries to take itself too seriously like its a real movie. The effects were garbage, and the acting was terrible even for a B movie. This one will not make it to the collection."
2,CHOP GOOEY,"Adam Green who was so subtle in his FROZEN shows little restraint in this blood-soaked sequel to HATCHET. I've been a lifetime horror fan my whole life but it seems today's films rely on massive gore rather than real scares. Aside from the insane ways the cast is bumped off, HATCHET II has little imagination or thrills.The story picks up from the original and instead of mindless teens we get mindless rednecks. We even get Tony Todd as ""Rev. Zombie"".Danielle Harris from the original HALLOWEEN is our heroine..now HALLOWEEN is one scary flick.If you like lotsa gore, this is for you."
1,The turd won,"So I took a dump, forgot to flush, went to watch this movie, mid-movie went back upstairs to flush and ended up watching the turd instead, as that was more interesting."
4,Humorous.,I always enjoy her books. If you like a light read with interesting characters you might want to give this a try.
4,Another enjoyable story from Bond,"I haven't yet read a Stephanie Bond story I didn't like, but I'll admit that there was a point, about 2/3 through this one, where I thought it dragged a bit. However,I trusted Bond to bring it all together in the end, and she did in her usual entertaining style. Some aspects of the ending seemed a bit forced to me, but it worked."
3,Whole Lotta Trouble,This book was not as interesting as the last Stephanie Bond book (Our Husband) that I read. It was readable but not as fast moving.
3,Whole Lotta Trouble,It was very engaging. The characters were funny & the plot was easy to follow. Which makes it easy to read when you are reading snippets of the book here & there
4,Great Book,"Pretty good story line, mystery and romance...what more could one ask for in a book....it was enough for me to start reading other books by this author."
3,Middle of the Road Read,"I've read better and I've read worse but, overall, I'd recommend this book for it's light reading, spots of humor, and smidge of romance. Basically, 3 friends in the publishing industry set out to humiliate a man who has been destroying their personal lives and careers. However, their stunt goes awry when the man ends up dead and the 3 women are suspects. The mystery of `who done it' kept me reading, but the conclusion to the mystery wasn't really satisfying. I also wish the author had explored the romances a bit more; there was a lot of chemistry between a few characters in the book but it wasn't a primary storyline. I would read a Stephanie Bond book again though and hope for a little more fun."
3,Whole Lotta Ho Hum,"Stephanie Bond's tale of intrigue in the publishing industry is one that may appeal to the many new authors that are entering the field through the revolution of independent publishing. However, I think some of the subtly will be lost on the general public. I found the writing to be adequate although the author used some boiler plate gimmicks in some of the imagery. The story was a little far fetched and had the feel of a comic strip rather than novel. Sure, I understood the humor, and some it was funny, but overall it lacked dimension. Some of the characters were not well developed although the two main characters Felicia and Tallie were adequate. The authors certainly has a slew of other works if you find that you enjoy her writing. As for me, I will try something different."
2,Very disappointing,"I threw this book at the wall. After a promising beginning, the story went downhill fast. The ending was beyond ridiculous."
2,Normally like her writing but just couldn't get into this one,"Just couldn't get into this one. I did like the opening with the accountant who sent in the 500 pg autobiography - seen a few of those myself. But the whole, secret agents and 'hidden in plain sight' thing was not where I wanted to be. Seems like I read something like it before except that the secret codes where hidden in a toy.In summary, I didn't make it through the whole book. I made it about 10 pages in the front and read the last chapter, it was all I could do. The writing style is fine but the story idea was a redo."
2,"Like the author, hate the book","Of the two female leads, one is so incredibly selfish it's a wonder she even has friends and the other is such a people-pleaser her stress is manifesting in physical ways. I know there's someone for everyone, but I was so unimpressed with the ""heroines"" I couldn't believe they could find men to legitimately love them. I fully admit I gave up midway and found something more interesting to read."
4,really enjoyable read,"I really enjoyed this book it's an easy read without angst or stress in the plot. I looked forward to reading it every night and wondered what would happen to the characters next as I thought about it through the day. For me thats a good book and one I look forward to reading. Im new to stephanie bond and this is the second book of hers that i've read (our husband was the 1st), I really enjoyed them both and am looking forward to reading more."
3,A Fun Story,"It seems women get into more trouble nowadays, but it is not their fault. Three women who just havehad enough and are doing something about it. However, it was really innocent....really! You'll laugh andmost likely agree with some of the antics of these women, along with feeling their pain."
4,"Very good, fast reading","I really enjoyed reading this book. It was an easy read. I am not one to read on a steady basis, so sometimes its difficult to keep focused on the story. In this book I had no problem picking up where I left off. I would, and I am reading other novels by this author."
4,More like 4 1/4 stars,Not a bad fast read. I felt there should have been more meat towards the last few chapters. It felt rushed like Ms. Bond wanted to finish off the story quickly.
4,Fun to read.,This book was fun to read. It captures your attention and is hard to put down. You want to find out what is going to happen next. A good summer read or anytime.
4,easy read,"Borrowed this from the lending library, its a funny murder mystery more laughter than suspense in this book. will read more by this author."
5,Soul gives you soul...,This purfume is great to add to your curve or any other collection. When you wear you it you feel sexy and confident. It's great to wear to work or for a night out on the town. A little bit of this product goes along way.
2,Never touch my soul!!,"This is not a fragrance I enjoy. I think it too floral and unbearable for someone like me who suffers from a severe case of sinusitis. After spraying it for the fist time, I could not use it again so I had to give it to a relative of mine. Not sure you would want to purchase based on my experience unless you are in a simlar situation like I.But I must comment on the fast shipment and the fact that I received the same item as described and the price is unbeatable. Go Amazon! GO!"
1,It stink,"I wish I knew what it smelled like before I brought it, I don't like the smell and it don't last"
4,Not for me,The perfume does smell very clean but I'm not too fond of it. It's like a strong soapy smell for me. It lasts just about the entire work day which is what I want in a perfume -biggest reason I gave this four stars. For $5 I think it was worth trying out.
5,smells good,I'm a guy so i don't really know what king of parfum to buy but after getting this for my bros wife she seamed to really like the smell it wasn't over powering but lasted a long time
5,A Fairely Good DVD Collection...,"Even though this DVD has only 10 video clips, I have been enjoying it quite a bit. All the clips were very well made but my favorite is ""Break It Down Again"", which wasn't included in some other similar dvd collections, along with the three biggest hits from the album ""Songs from the Big Chair"". Video quality is superb and PCM stereo (only audio track) sounds great. Disc was made in Germany.Tracks are:1. Break It Down Again2. Shout3. Goodnight Song4. Mother's Talk5. Head over Heels6. Advice for the Young at Heart7. Everybody Wants to Rule the World8. Sowing The Seed of Love9. Woman in Chains (with Oleta Adams)10.Mad WorldThis DVD is definitely worth getting especially for the cheap price (when I bought). Highly recommended!"
5,great cd,This cd is great especially for new fans. It has most of their best songs. best spanish rock band ever!!!
3,Well crafted Lovecraft,"A well crafted movie with fine acting, a benign subtle humour, and a charismatic Ellen Pedersen in a wonderful bit part as Grandma."
5,Rediculously Entertaining,"A perfect mix of cheesy monsters and great one liners. This film kept me dialed in until the very end. McGinn does a great job of bringing the viewer right into the Lovecraft story line, even for those (me)who are unfamiliar with background. I don't remember a movie with a better mix of quality comedy and horror. I will definitely be on the look out for McGinn's next project. Hey McGinn, if you read these, use Barak Hardley again, he was hilarious! If you like Fanboys, The Hangover, grew up watching The Goonies, or like any movie that has ever been on the SciFi channel, CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT! You won't be disappointed. It's only 13 bucks, just buy it."
4,Very fun movie,"As other have said this movie is reminiscent of Shaun of the Dead for its comedic style. The animated vignettes throughout the movie are really well done and plot appropriate. As a Lovecraft fan, I wasn't expecting a horror type movie and therefore was not disappointed. There are many quotes from the movie that will have you laughing out loud. The creature effects were fairly good for such a low budget offering. The characters embrace the nerd stereotype and the result is some great dialog and memorable scenes.It is nice to see this type of work, that takes a good-natured poke at the normally weighty Lovecraft Mythos. The movie ends with sequel potential and I'd certainly be up for another funny tale of dark cults and tentacles."
4,Good Fun if you don't have a stick lodged between your cheeks.,"The film the Last Lovecraft is worth your time if you are (A) a Lovecraft fan, and (B) you have a sense of humor. You will read allot of reviews bashing this movie, the people who write those review should be pitied. They are so locked in to what they feel is Lovecraft's vision that they won't allow themselves to laugh.That being said, I love Lovecraft's work, i have read all of it, including the work he ghost wrote or teamed up with other people. I also have the innate ability to not take myself, or really anything too seriously. If by describing myself, i inadvertently described a reasonable facsimile of you, get this movie. And if you are like me, when its finished you will (A) wonder how tight the stick is lodged between the cheeks of someone who would hate this movie, and (B) hope there is a sequel.Hope this helps, and be sure to read the negative reviews, they are something special."
3,Just kinda meh...,"So I read a bunch of these reviews and thought that all these people must be friends of the director or something, cuz this movie looks awful.Well I just gave it a shot on Netflix (which had similar glowing praise) and for a no budget movie it manages to rise ever so slightly above the muck. It's got a few funny bits so if you're a Lovecraft completist this movie won't be too painful. The director has no clue which can be a little jaring; for example,look at the box cover art. The star of the movie is the guy in the background on the left. All through the movie the star just kind of ambles along, overshadowed by the other two characters. It's never confusing who the star is, but what is confusing is why the other characters do all the heavy lifting. In other words the hero never really has his hero journey.Not worth buying but get all your nerd buddies together and watch it on Netflix."
3,"""It's A Nerd Black Hole""","The Last Lovecraft is perhaps the geekiest movie I've seen in a while. It can be fun and entertaining, but the characters did grate on my nerves at times. And the movie was too short to live up to its potential. Running at only 73 minutes sans closing credits, I felt there was more story that could have been told."
3,Dorks From The Deep,"Reviews Of Unusual Size!Re: Jeff is an average guy that just happens to be the last descendant of HP Lovecraft. So naturally, it falls to him when Cthulhu starts to rise, sending his slimy minions to seal the deal and steal a relic from Jeff and his misanthrope friends.Outstanding: This movie has a great sense of humor about itself, and though many fall flat it stays pretty amusing throughout. The traditional special effects, especially the monster suits are well done.Unacceptable: The same can't be said about the CG, unfortunately, which is very cartoony and jarring. The humor is a little broad sometimes, and I thought the grandma was a poor addition. I didn't like the makeup for Starspawn at all, his tentacles were too small and random, and he was too red.Summary: Worth watching, but not a classic. Certainly the best HP Lovecraft comedy action horror movie out there!3/5"
2,yuck,They all have the same flaw in them. one channel(side) always has more bass than the other. if its not that then they are never balanced right. all in all they are cheap so your gunna get a cheap manufactured headphone. i recommend you look for something else because this product is a waste of money
3,Not as helpful as I'd hoped,"I bought this book to help me figure out how to use my TI-83 Plus for College Algebra. When I took Algebra in high school over 30 years ago, no one used calculators like this - we had to learn to figure everything on paper. As I got to different chapters, I tried to look up how to do a certain function, and for the most part - I couldn't find it in this book. Because Algebra was hard for me to understand, I sometimes did not know what I needed to do to calculate the formula. It would have been nice if there had been a little more help in that regard. Luckily, the class is over and I am returning my rented calculator and planning to resell my book."
2,"Not like other books for ""Dummies""","It is not much information, to be honest. I picked up a few tips, but not what I expected for the money. I have found a simple internet search will give you much more detailed information on the type of problem you are working on and how to solve it with the TI-83+. Worth it if you can pick up a copy used for a buck or two, otherwise, trust me and just use Google."
2,OK,"Not easy to navigate book, not easy to follow, ended up going to Google and getting my answer. Google got it fast and easy, this book- waste of my time."
2,Graphic calculator TU-83 Plua,"It was not the one i ordered! ?They showed lots of them and i clicked on the one with the case and plug. That's the one i thought i was getting but got a total different one and of course there is no number to call anyone about it. You think when you spend that much money on something, I get what i wanted. Next time i will just go to Best Buy!"
1,Minimally useful,"I found this product minimally useful. To find out how to clear errors, you have to two locations in the book which is a nuisance. Instructions on other operations were not clear."
2,Am surprised by the other positive reviews,"I loved the finance section of this book but everything else was simply a rehash of what is in the existing TI-83+ book which can be downloaded for free from the TI website. As a matter of fact the free download from the TI website is far superior. This book comes across more as a recipe book which explains how to push buttons but does not give much examples as to why you might want to do this. I find it significantly different from the TI-89 book for dummies which I would easily give 5 stars to. I am even suspicious that the Finance chapter was written by a different person than the rest of the book, or possibly that the author's area of expertise was Finance and he wasn't that familiar with anything else."
4,TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator (manual) for Dummies,"The product was delivered quickly, and the book was in perfect condition, but I feel that I must be more of a dummy than the author had in mind, as I have been unable to figure out some of the instructions for a couple of the simpler functions. It is not to be handed to me on a platter, evidently. I shall not be daunted. No daunts here. I shall go on, undaunted. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. Much better than the TI manual."
1,Horrible Book,"Truly a horrible book. Don't buy it - get it from a library or buy a used copy. Mr. Moore shouldn't receive a dime in royalties. This retired BATF agent doesn't attempt to hide his hatred of the FBI, The National Rifle Association (NRA), and ""Gun Lovers"" (his description) of all types. To try to smear the NRA, he states that the NRA lied about BATF, yet he wrote numerous falsehoods (lies) about the NRA. For example, he falsely wrote that the NRA sold the rifle (that killed President Kennedy) to Oswald. Such false statements make an intelligent reader question all his so-called ""facts"". A reader would have to review all his footnotes and source material to judge if his ""facts"" and conclusions are accurate or just a reflection of his bias, hatred and prejudice. Is the BATF filled with agents such as this? If so, we may have a real problem. Mr. Moore clearly advocates ignoring citizen rights to nail BATF targets. The Second Amendment? It doesn't exist for Mr. Moore."
5,Gospel Aerobics {Michelle LeMay} Video,I like this video. The clairity is good and not fuzzy. I am glad to know there are fitness expert who are willing to show one can be fit by working out to Gospel music and not just the secular music. This videio actually exceeded my expectations.
4,vhs is outdated,"I love this workout tape but, only order it on dvd! I can no longer use mine. The moves are a bit much at first but you will catch on. Let the praises move your soul. My goodness, the cool down music is so very relaxing."
5,Very Handy,I love that is on wheels and scoots around the garden with ease. Could be a couple inches higher as the knees are getting older and creak more. The open storage underneath makes it easy to get at tools when you need them.
3,ok,"My last one was about 20 yrs. old, & simply wore out. This one is open to the rain, & not easily moved when I'm sitting on it....like the old one. It is sturdy. If left out in the rain, the bottome tool holder holds water, which I don't like...think I will drill holes that will let the water out."
5,Excellent buy!,I purchased this item last month and liked it so much I just ordered a second one for a friend.
3,Could have been designed so much better,"When i purchased this item i had assumed that the top part was a lid that could be opened and closed. Admittedly that was my mistake but i think the item would have benefited immensely from this alteration. The wheels work well enough, the seat is pretty large although putting tools under the seat can be a bit awkward. I also would have liked some sort of hole so that i could attach a piece of rope thus allowing me to tow the hopper around the yard instead of bending down and picking it up. I accomplished this by drilling a hole at the edge of the seat plastic and securing a piece of acrylic rope.Overall this item was not as convenient as i had hoped but i was able to adjust by adding the rope. Turning the top seat into an opening lid unfortunately wasnt possible."
4,Garden Hopper Mobile,"I bought it so that I could reach things lower down without having to bend from the waist for long periods of time. This does the job well and I can now reach baseboards and the backs of low cabinets and move along while doing it without getting up. It is sturdy, just the right height, easy to pick up and carry to my next project, and I feel safe since I no longer ""fall off my improvised perch"" (an upside down kitty litter bucket). Great for people with knee problems. Just what I was looking for."
5,rolling garden seat,"I used this in the house to sit on when I pulled up old carpet padding & the 5 million staples that was left in the floor. It works good in the garden, too. but will sink in the soft dirt. Only wish the seat flipped up to store things inside instead of sliding them in through the hole."
4,"Sturdy, practical, and FUN!","I bought this to do some painting and work close to floor level. I gave it four stars because I wish the wheels were bigger. It's fun to play on, too - have the kids pull you down your Victorian hallway, laughing all the way!; then take it outside to weed the soil around your favorite tree. Versatile."
1,Hasn't arrived,"I am a disappointed and a little concerned because this has not arrived yet. It was ordered several weeks ago. So I haven't had a chance to try it out and the garden season is about over. So therefore, I rated it the lowest, even though I don't know if I hate it or not!!!"
3,needs improvement,this stool makes gardening easier but it really needs hand holes on each end to hold it while you're moving from side to side on unlevel or lumpy grass. It would also be helpful if the top/seat lifted to have easy access to the things you have inside. it's also kinda awkward reaching inside while you're sitting on it. I haven't tried the cup holder yet.
5,Great Ride,Both myself and my husband have had a ball with this little ride. Myself in my garden and with my husband painting our 300' long white picket fence. At our ages in the 70's it is hard to get up and down a lot. With this little ride it is easy to move along with your project and not have to do all that bending up and down. One of the best buys we have made in a long time. It is by far the best $30 purchase I have ever made. It is very light weight and easy to carry around.
3,It's alright. . .,"It's ok, it looked like the top would open kind of like a lid (like I've seen with others) but it doesn't. The drink holder will only hold a tiny cup w/o a lid, so you'd have to worry about bugs, dirt, etc. falling in your cup. But it is still useful, and great for toting around your garden tools, and to sit on w/o hurting your back."
4,cute and functional,Even though it was very nice and well though-out I had to return it. We live in a hilly and rocky area and it was not suitable for the terrain.
3,Good But Needs Improvement,"If you're a lightweight and looking for something to scoot you along, then this is for you; however, if you're a little on the heavy side even the slightest, the wheels on this hesitate to move smoothly. The reason is these do not have wheels that are totally rounded on the inside as well as the outside. Picture a wheel cut in half and each half goes on opposite sides of the garden stool, so the wheel itself is not very supported on the inside. Now, I have another garden stool I got from Home Depot. The wheels are round on the inside and out, much stronger, roll smoother and have a seat which you can pick up to use as a handle to haul supplies, kind of like a kid's wagon. On this you cannot. So, as I said, if all you want is something to scoot on and you're a skinny-mini type of person, then this will do well for you. Otherwise, try your local garden center."
5,Saves your back!,"The Garden Hopper is great. It has saved my back already this spring! It is very sturdy and rolls easily, even on bumpy ground. I would recommend this to anyone who does any gardening."
3,Sturdy but could have more handy features,"This is a very sturdy little item for yard work, but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight. Would be nice if it was a few inches taller. The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible, and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there. Would also be nice to have a ""tongue"" so that you could pull it along."
5,Garden Hopper Mobile Garden Stool & Storage,Any gardener or weedpuller will absolutely love thishandy little knee saver. Just the right height towork in yard or garden - and even has a place to keeptools or gloves - or an extra can of Diet Pepsi.Worth every penny...
3,Product not as described,"The lid on the Garden Hopper is not hinged and it does not open. Other reviewers have noted this flaw, but Amazon continues describing the product incorrectly. There seems to be a near-complete disconnect between Amazon, the products being sold through Amazon, and the product descriptions. Otherwise, the service is great. And the Garden Hopper is OK."
4,great item,"Great product for the price. A long handle on the front to pull it would help, but overall I am very pleased with it.."
4,garden hopping,MY 87 YR. SISTER LOVES TO GARDEN -BUT- GETTING UP & DOWN WAS A PROBLEM.I BROUGHT HER THE GARDEN HOPPER FOR HER BIRTHDAY & NOW SHE'S HOPPING ALL OVER THE GARDEN. VERY GOOD PRODUCT.THANKS AMAZON
3,MOBILE GARDEN STOOL,A very sturdy stool. The only minus point is that it is very low so it makes it difficult to stand upright from the sitting position.
5,Mobile Garden Stool,"Due to a leg injury I can no longer kneel to do painting or gardening. I bought this wheeled garden stool to get me low enough and move without getting up. Works well for my purpose. I am a 180 lb. female and can say it works and wheels along just fine. Top doesn't pop up or come off, but works well as a handle and gives me a place to store my gloves, clippers, etc."
5,fantastic,"Great product. I have bad knees and this makes working so much easier. I like it so much outside, that I plan on buying another for indoors."
5,great little cart,We love the little stool on wheels. We are using it to navigate through a crawl space more easily. And it will always be available for yard work or maintenance projects.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W430/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
4,Mobile Garden Stool,Have used this product only once since receiving. The weather has not been nice enough to work in the yard. So far I am pleased.
4,Successful gift,Purchased as a gift for an avid gardener. She loved it. Plans to use it in the Spring in her garden.
2,too low,Just sitting in the garage. I found it too low for my comfort so haven't used it much. Would work nicely for a smaller person.
5,Nice,It was sent promptly and I am very satisfied. I would recommend this vendor. I got it after the season so can't tell you how much I liked it!!
2,PETE'S EVALUATION - AGE 81 FOR GARDEN STOOL,"This would be good in a flower garden area where there are small places with a hard surface to roll on; but in a vegetable garden with soft dirt, it doesn't work very well. It's great to sit on to pull weeds; but then you have to get up and move it yourself to the next area that you want to work. It sure beats standing in a bent-over position pulling weeds."
5,Easier gardening,This has been wonderful. I am disabled and gardening had been very difficult for me. With the hopper I am at the right level and the ability to scoot to where I want to be is great. No more backaches from bending.
2,Disappointment/incorrect description,The seat is not hinged like the product description said.....therefore plants can't be pulled in it because the seat doesn't flip up
3,Gave this as a gift,"It's a nice looking item but would be much more useful if the wheels actually turned. As it is, it's just a seat and has to be moved instead of rolling along."
5,Garden Hopper also a House Hopper,"I got this Hopper to sit on while painting baseboards and doing all sorts of close to the floor projects around the house. I love it, and my kids love playing with it."
5,Very sturdy,"I appreciate that this reasonably priced garden seat can support my extreme overweight, and allow me to roll to the next plant as well."
4,the Garden Hopper,My sister-in-law told me about the Garden Hopper and said they were supposed to be a great idea for gardening. I checked them out on AMAZON and found one that paid for the shipping and got it cheaper than buying it in the store. Good shopping experience !
5,Knee Saver,This mobile stool is perfect for garden work. It gets me off my knees and is a good height so there's no back pain while bending.There's no hunting for tools as they can be stored in the handy compartment in the stool. I love it!
4,Step2 Garden Hopper Mobile Stool and Storage #5A0000,I am happy with the stool except I would like to have the storage compartment air tight so I could leave all my tools in it and store it outdoors.
5,A gardener's must-have item,"This is another must-have item for anyone who likes to garden or pull weeds from the yard. I purchased this with the Fiskars 9424 Garden Bucket Caddy and now I actually enjoy working outside again. The Garden Hopper is lightweight and easily moves around a thick yard of grass with little effort. I don't use the storage area located underneath, instead I place my garden tools in the bucket caddy and place weeds and debris in the bucket. I can't believe I used to stoop over or kneel, and my back would always pain me for several days later. I wish I had thought about getting these items years ago. Gardening and weeding are like a meditation for me, my friends think I'm weird when I tell them this is what I did on my day off. The garden stool would also be ideal for those who have to paint the floorboards or cut in at the base of a wall."
2,A disappointment,As an elderly gardener I thought this would be a great help to me but it is not easy to use.The height is fine and it is reasonably easy to get up from it.However it does not wheel well.Proper tyres would help.The seat is slippery and I find it quite difficult to carry around.
4,Garden Hopper Stool,"THis thing did what it was supposed to. A great foot and back saver. The interior could have been a hair longer for some of the various hand tools. We even used it as a four wheel dolly, to transport a large pot across the yard."
2,Small,It looks bigger in the picture and it is too small to do much with it. Ace Hardware sells some that are much nicer for about $5.00 more.
3,Just one problem,There's only one problem with this stool - you can't leave it outside if there's any possibility of rain. The hole in the top leaks water down into the storage cabinet - bad news for rustable parts and garden gloves. I tuck mine under the eaves. That's OK for straight-down rain but no good for blowing rain. Otherwise it's great.
4,Puzzled by the poor review,"I read this years ago and, as someone with anger issues, I found it useful. I especially appreciated learning the many ways - and expressions - we use to disguise our anger.Miller's comment ""outdated, and really kinda fun to read and realize folks used to think like this"" is a great puzzle to me. Anger is as old as humanity. Hard to understand exactly how it's dated."
5,Motion Sickness Medication,"I've been using Marezine for many, many years. Mostly for passengers on my boat, but occasionally for me. I'm a U.S. Coast Guard licensed captain, and frequently have non-seagoing guests aboard. I've tried just about every other over-the-counter medication available, and Marezine has not failed me yet. IT MUST BE TAKEN PRIOR TO DEPARTURE!!! My passengers have not experienced the drowsiness, which is common with most other meds."
5,For those who want to keep taking it . . .,"My husband takes this every day (to help with ADD) and after some research discovered that Bonine for Kids has the same main ingredient (CYCLIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE) in it. Note that this is only true for Bonine *for Kids*, not the regular Bonine. So he has switched to that, now that this is discontinued, and it works just as well. I do hope that this comes back, as Bonine for Kids is more expensive, comes in small packages, and has half the amount of cyclizine hydrochloride in each tablet that this does. But if it works, it works. Hope this can help someone else."
3,A good item for the island of misfit toys,"Ok. So we didn't look at the fine print on the box which never proclaimed it to be a bath toy. I think wheels on the boat should have given it away. But the boat sinks and all of the sea animals float--go figure that one out. Otherwise my kids enjoy playing with it--in the tub--even though the boat makes no pretense at floating, and the only way the sea animals make it to the bottom is if they fill up with mucky tub water--a quality which won't make this toy last in our house very long."
1,BUY FROM STORE!!!!,I am surprised to see this item at $58.00. This exact product is 19.99 at TOYS R US. DO NOT PAY 58 dollars for a 20 dollar product.
3,"Ages 3 - 9, uhhhh NO.","The dragon figure and ramming gear are done well. However, the rider figure breaks apart way too easy. I would not let a child under 7 years old play with the toy for this reason."
5,Maria Veloso makes poetry with her words,"I don't even have the words to express how beautifully written ""MIdwinter Turns to Spring"" is. All I can say is that Maria Veloso makes poetry with her words. It was heartwarming to read such a love story with pure depth of emotions like hope, faith and selfless love. The music -- oh the music! -- gives me goosepimples whenever I listen to it. I hope Maria continues making beautiful music and writing stories as unforgettable as this."
5,The Best Jordan Video of All,"I have seen almost all of the Michael Jordan videos yet Come Fly With me is special. This is the only video that captures the essence of Michael Jordan in his prime. Jordan was definitely most breath-taking to watch when he consistently went for the daring lay-ups and the spectacular dunks. This video was filmed before Jordan was a world icon and doesn't contain all the scrutiny and controversy that is present in such videos as Above & Beyond and Air Time. If you are all about the highlights, this is your video."
2,Total waste of time,I watched this movie expecting nothing more than eye candy and I was disappointed. The characters are annoying and I started hoping they'd be killed ending my misery.
2,Horrible Picture Quality,"Enough has been written about this movie. You either like it or not. I personly like it. My comments are about the transfer to DVD. I have owned both the DVD and Blu-ray and the picture is horrible on both. I have tried the DVD in three diffent players and TVs and the picture is very grainy in most scene were the robots appear. I was hoping that the Blu-ray would be better, but WRONG!!! It's just as bad. Why pay $5-$10 more for the same quality picture. The same thing is wrong with Terminator Salvation. What happened to high definition? I have other, older movies ( Beetlejuice, Cutthroat Island, Patton) were the picture is beautiful. What's going on here????"
4,"thrilling, great special effects",Always afraid of the sequel's not living up to original movies. This one can be enjoyed by those familiar with the first movie and also those who have never seen the original. Some serious adult humor throughout which may not be appropriate for the age group I originally purchased it for (the youngsters who appreciate the toys etc.) but deffinately something we as adults enjoyed. The p13 rating and movie comedy don't exactly coincide with the kids who typically are transformer toy oriented. But as a movie for the older crowd I would recommend it strongly.
1,Good if you're wasted,"Pros: Lots of explosions, Megan Fox is hot, cool visual effects, Megan Fox is hot, a lot more action than the first movie, and Megan Fox is hot.Cons: Most shallow character development ever, innumerable plot holes, a lot of transformations and explosions just for the sake of, well, transformations and explosions, no sense of continuity or cohesiveness in the characterization of the transformers' abilities and motivations, overall retarded script."
1,bad disk!,"I was really looking forward to getting this movie for my wife who really likes transformers. The rating on the disk said ""like new condition"" but when it arrived the disk is scratched so that we can't even watch the movie. if it skipped a couple of times I think I could accept it but this thing locks up and I have to eject the disk to regain control of my DVD player. I am disappointed."
2,"Unbelievably stupid movie but amazing computer effects, and of course Megan Fox","I had heard about the Transformers movies and just wanted to see one for myself. An unbelievably stupid movie for twelve year old boys. Almost impossible to follow the so-called ""plot,"" just a lot of giant Hasbro toys bashing each other, and constant explosions. The actors don't speak, they shout, exaggerate, chatter uncontrollably and act like idiots, nonstop. Three saving graces. The computer animated digital effects are amazing. Some of the US military footage is remarkable. And of course Megan Fox. What a beauty. Unfortunately - I never saw her in a movie before - her acting skills are dumber than a box of rocks. She should not try to talk. I rarely fail to finish watching a movie but I just could not follow the story and there came a point of one explosion too many. It's sad that Hollywood makes money producing such dreck."
3,The first was better,"The movie was good except for the unnecessary sexual scenes like the dog humping and transformer balls. Would have been a great movie with out Michael Bay trying to make it a great movie with gratuitous sexual scenes.The good points are the nods to past transformer fans! It was awesome to see combiners and small nods to old fans. So overall, good try."
5,Me Like Splosions!!,"Stuf blowed up and lite flash in me eyes. Their wuz girl on screan and she be hot two, Whoo nead storie wen we gotz hot chik!?!!? I eazily enertaaned and dont nead nuthin mo then brite lite N wirring noize. Tummoro i whatch blendir in ma kitczhen fore threa ours. Lay offf micky bey, he awzume and i gots gud taaste in muvies and u dont no nuthin. Piece...."
2,somewhat all good,"Well, over all the movie was good. Didn't have to think cause it really is a Saturday afternoon B-movie. But did they really have to put sexual raunchiness into it, seriously a dog humping another dog was funny once, but after the second got old. And the fact a robot humping a leg was not needed. Plus the language by the two ""gheto"" robots was not even funny and now I can't take kids to see it because of them. Seriously this was supposed to be a family movie for pure entertainment, but falls short on the friendliness."
1,Booo,"It sucked balls. This movie was way to flashy and had a plot that was about as compelling as sitting in a old folks home all day long. I mean come on!!!!!! The franchise was booming and soaring to new heights and than the let Michael Bay fly and take the lead. And predictably he crashed it into the ocean.....BOOM. Movie sucked. Plot was non existent. Only reason to watch the movie is for Megan Fox. OMG she is smoking as always. Save your money and bootleg this movie, not worth buying."
1,I'd rather be at a dentist,"AWFUL movie. Plot was so thin, acting was mediocre, dialogue was gut-wrenching. Special effects were amazing, but all the special effects in the world couldn't put this humpty dumpty plot back together again..."
2,Not so great,"Transformers 2 was a let down, it was not as good as the first one by any means; however if you have 1 you must have 2."
4,Long awaited sequel!!!!!!,"This was a great moive. It was hard to compete with the previous one, but held its own. The graphics and CGI has evolved and with that you see more action scenes with the transformers. I can't wait for a part III...there is one in the making is there not?"
3,Transformers II,"Interesting movie, but the first one is way better. Effects in both are kind of cool but the first one did a better job making it believable. The second on was for the most part hokie. IMHO I would not buy this one if you are thinking it is going to be like the first movie."
3,Overall a good film,Overall I enjoyed the movie with my family. Good story line and excellent special effects. They did a good job with anticipation for what was to happen throughout the movie.
3,Stupidly OK,"If you accept from the beginning that this movie is going to have horrible acting, stereotypes, and a confusing story, then maybe you'll be able to semi-enjoy this. Just like the first movie, the special effects are awesome (except I still find the robots to be way too busy.) Shia what's-his-face did a pretty decent job, but the rest of the acting was subpar at best. The entire college thing was dumb. Huge over-the-top frat parties and tricked-out dorm rooms? Seriously?Lower your standards and if you understand that this is a dumb movie with lots of explosions, then you might appreciate it."
1,"Good Lord, Spare me from this crap!","I made it about an hour and 15 minutes into this very long and horrible movie. What a waste of money. No plot, Speilberg comic relief and scatological humor updated for 2009. Poor Megan Fox made up like an over the hill porn star having her leg humped by a cybernetic dog was probably the low point. Way too much profanity for a kids film, but if it was any good at all I might overlook that. Fine special effects I suppose. No likeable characters, even the nice guy cars are obnoxious in this one.What a shameful huge steaming pile, kind of like the stegosaurus poop in Jurassic park come to think of it."
3,Too much action and not much else,"There is such a thing as too much action, but sometimes I think Hollywood forgets that. This movie was mostly action with little else. It just seemed like one special effect after the other and no pause. I've seen worse films than this, but this could have been better. This movie is like watching a video game. I just can't recommend that anyone go out and pay full price for this movie. Wait for cable or get it used for a cheap price. I think the 3 stars average rating it has here is about right."
5,Very Good.....,"Nuts to all of the nay-sayers. This was an excellent follow-up to the original. If, indeed, you enjoyed the first installment.....you will enjoy this movie. Highly recommended..."
3,Tries too hard to impress Disney channel tweens,"Obviously the special effects are impressive and the Transformers fights are as satisfying as old Godzilla movies were to my younger self.The weakness is that so much of the dialogue has been written to impress and amuse tweens who are accustomed to the Disney channel. The flippant language, the histrionic whining... I could go on but I'll just sum it up with a quote: ""Punkass Decepticon!""The other thing is that it's extremely sexual for what I thought was a family movie. The depiction of the protagonist's freshman year experience at Princeton is about as realistic as the scantily-clad Megan Fox."
1,Insult to fans and intelligence,"For those of us who grew up with the cartoon, and loved the toys as kids, this movie is a horrible disappointment.What it lacks in plot it makes up for with gratuitous dog sex scenes and crude jokes. Though the action and special effects are decent, they could have been chopped up and added to movies with plots and been much more wisely used. Because of said Gratuitous dog sex I don't even feel comfortable letting children watch it. Not because I'm offended by dog sex, but because I would hate for children to believe that it qualifies as entertainment.Words cannot express my level of contempt for this absolute garbage that some people call a film."
3,Flawed,"This still has the chemistry between Sam and Mikaela. This is still saturated with Robotic battles and human survival. So it's good enough to watch. This gives fans enough Shia, Megan, Optimus and Megatron to continue the series.That said it's flawed. A tiny piece of the cube resurrected Megatron, but a whole quest was needed to resurrect Optimus Prime? Also at the end of the original Bumble Bee could speak, so why couldn't he in this one? And the new Autobots added in this one weren't very bright.More importantly that political engineering in the movie is disgusting. When the original was made the Republicans had the White House, so the movie just used the phrase ""The President"", and has the government siding with the Autobots against the Dicepticons. This one was made when the Democrats have the White House, so it uses the name ""President Obama"", and has a government that impedes the war and fears the Autobots."
2,Awsome Effects & Poor Story.,"I'm a fan of the Transformers since I was growing up. Loved the first movie, but this one is very disappointing. I'm puertorrican, but whats the deal with Sam's new friend? What was his ""real"" role in this movie? and what about the two ghetto robots? Common! Megan Fox really sucked in this movie! BUT! I really enjoy the CGI!"
1,Disgusting Distasteful,"This movie starts out with more sexual content than should EVER be in a pg13. Just a mere ten years ago, this would of got an R rating for sure. In the first ten minutes, there are dogs humping several times, his girlfriend scantly dressed, his mother saying how his cherry got popped, his mother eating brownies with marajuana in them, a girl dressed like a hooker, strattles his lap....need I go on!! Transformers used to be a KID thing. This movie is definately not for kids and not really worth watching for adults. Its sorta like pre-porn for my young sons....Disgusting..."
2,"Starscream and Soundwave could have stolen the show, didn't need 2 see so much of shia and the twins.","Soundwave just sat in orbit and did nothing, no fighting, he could have move over egypt during the fight scene and ""brought the rain"" but noooooooo. Starscream during the desert fight scene could have attack the same way he did in pt 1. It looked like Star went out of his way 2 NOT kill anybody; since when did he avoid trying 2 kill humans? Those foolish twins got the most screen time of all the bots and they seriously got 2 start moving away from having this series revolving around that Sam kid. Sure wish Rob Zombie would write and direct this."
1,ZERO STARS,"jeff,old-timer young dude must not have seen the same movie I have, because this movie just stinks. Dont waste your time or money on this movie. Buy the 80s classic of the transformers the movie. You wont be disapointed."
4,Pretty cool Summer Movie,"We enjoyed the first transformers and enjoyed the second one as well. folks, this is not an academy award contender..most summer movies arent. *rolls eyes* Combined with the subject matter and the director, this was a ""non stop"" action movie anyone should have expected it to be, with parts of it having me cracking up, and even my painfully unfunny husband laughing as well.Some language and sexual references that werent in the first movie, but our 8 year old knows those words arent acceptable, he told me so :), and to be honest, he remembers the transformers, not what they said. I would still be wary taking children under 13. you've got to know your kids, IMO. my son has seen it 2 times now."
1,No Excuse for how awful it is,"This film is one of the few times the film critics have ever agreed. This is without a doubt one of the worst films ever created. Certainly the worst blockbuster ever created. The people who made this film should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. This was disgraceful at how mindless and awful it was. But, with Michael Bay on board, I could have seen this coming. The only thing more pathetic about how awful this film is, is that people went to see the movie, and they'll probably buy the dvd.If you are going to buy this film don't. There are plently of good films out there that won't be in the $4.99 bin at a gas station in six months. This film without a doubt will be. It was awful."
1,Sorry!,"Sorry I purchased this DVD for my grandaughter's ninth birthday. Too dark, violent, inappropriate!"
4,Great!,"I ordered this movie as a gift for my brother-in-law, I ordered it early and took advantage of free shipping. I actually recieved it quicker than I thought I would and everything was packaged very nicely. Items were in great condition, no smushed or scratched items. I was very happy with my purchase!"
4,Robots and Action,"This movie is full of action. It is not quite as good as the first film, but it is still very good."
5,overall great package!,"Say what you will about a Michael Bay movie; I was highly entertained by this one. The special effects are phenomenal, acting great(you have to remember that most of the robot scenes are acted with actors and papercutout on a stick). Bay does a wonderful job integrating the action with his camerawork, it amazes me to this day.The blu-ray version has colors so vibrant that you believe you are actually there. And the best part is the behind the scenes: methodically showing what went into this movie, which was a lot of hard work.People bash Michael Bay movies for being vapid. I don't expect to walk out of a movie quoting Kierkegaard; I go to escape reality and immerse myself in pure entertainment. That is what this movie did for me, and the blu-ray package could not have been done any better in my opinion. Worth the money."
3,Not sure what the movie was supposed to be.....,"This movie is a harder movie to review than the previous one. So I am going to stick to my ""good/bad/summary"" approach.On the good side, I thought this movie had a lot more depth than the previous Transformers movie (which was much more a shallow movie for fans). It is still not a deep movie, but it poses some material that can actually be food for thought.On the negative side, I there were a number of things that REALLY bugged me about the movie and made it downright cheesy. Having Optimus Prime spit out teeth during the fight is just wrong on so many levels. Similarly the college scenes were extraordinarily cheesy by any standard.If this is a movie just made for fans, I suppose I would have to say it doesn't measure up. I think it was an attempt at something more, but where neither the director nor the screenwriter had any idea what that ""something more"" was supposed to be. The result, while interesting to watch once, simply doesn't measure up."
1,The Wrong Darn Disk,This was the second time I ordered this movie from GoHastings. The first time the disk was badly scratched and then the second time it was the right case but the wrong movie. They were my preferred dealer to order used movies from but they need to do better to keep my business.
2,HORRIBLE! OBNOXIOUS!,"I would have cut out about 1 hour of this nightmare of a movie. It was so obnoxious, unnecessary footage and horrible. The first one was one of my favorite movies. This sequel was done so fast and thrown together that it showed the low quality and low time put into it."
3,Not as good as the first,"I bought this movie simply because I needed something new to watch because my son is addicted to the series. Transformers 2 has a lot of action, but I felt the plot was weak. I felt like I was in the middle of the story at the beginning. I am still excited to watch the third Transformers and the 2nd was a nice change, but the first movie was the bomb!!"
3,Story first...then the eye candy,"There just did not seem to be an intriguing story behind all this. It's noisy and flashy and moves fast, but I never got emotionally involved. The two jiving robots were embarrassing and degrading, and I'm a white guy. Two dogs humping, and a robot humping Fox's leg...now that's what I call entertainment. The first Transformers had a story and was enjoyable. This one just assumed we cared about the characters, I think we needed a few scenes to get us re-involved with them. Then we would have been experiencing all the action vicariously thru them...not just watching in a detached way."
1,The worst movie of 2009,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen marked one of those rare instances where I walked out of the theater not only feeling like I'd watched a bad movie, but also feeling insulted and even violated. Every single solitary element of this movie is juvenile, crass, amatuerish, condescending and just plain awful. Be it the embarrassingly inane dialogue, the superficial direction, the wooden acting, the non-existant story, or the cluttered, messy and all but incomprehensible action scenes, TF 2 shoots for the level of god-awful Hollywood schlock not seen since Batman and Robin. Avoid like the plague."
2,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"My family thought this DVD was good until in the middle and at the end. Was going to send it back, but it would have cost more than we paid for the DVD."
1,Not exactly a kids movie,"Is it just me or is every shot with Megan Fox in it centered around her Breast? Seriously?!?! This is supposed to be a Kids movie!! Not a border line pron movie!! I had to talk my kid out of the Theater after the tail came out of the ""fem Bots"" crotch!?!!?! super standards there guys!!!"
2,"The first one was better, if they make a 3rd one....GET RID OF THE PARENTS.","The first one was so good we had to get the dvd. I went with my friends, and while we were hoping to see the new characters in action, all we got was the woman who played sam's mother being annoying as hell, not funny at all. I cant believe she got more screen time than the new characters who show up only about a minute (sideswipe, jolt, etc). The woman was making a FOOL of herself and it was not funny at all. We all were like...is this supposed to be funny? The effects were great. Oh man, the parents show up at the end too. Too bad it wasnt better. so if they make a third one...i hope the parents are not there...specially the mother. Needed a better script and maybe a better director. the humor in it just wasnt funny."
1,elizabeth,"It seems like my dvds were stolen in the mail,however I did receive 1 out of the 3 dvds that I ordered.I would have gotten all 3 if they had been shipped out as 1 shipment..So thats my comment.."
1,Who is the target audience?,"Too much sex for little kids and a script that cannot hold adult interest. Who is the target audience of this movie anyway? Great special effects, but a script that worked on several levels like Toy Story could have saved this project. Does anybody in Hollywood read the scripts anymore? The script is beyond lame. If you make the decision to see the movie, do it the cheapest way possible like streaming and remember I told you that you may regret even the four bucks. Take my advice and lower the sound so you can't hear what the actors are saying and just watch the special effects as a background to something that is actually fun like a party."
1,My God this movie sucked,"I really thought that this could not suck nearly as much as the first one. I was so wrong. It sucked twice as hard. Two and a half hours of Shia Ladouche saying the following monosyllabic words in various combinations: No, wait, stop, bro, dude. Add to that Transformers who talk like Chris Tucker in Rush Hour and call people ""p*ssies,"" and you have the makings of steaming pile of crap. What a waste. Michael Bay, you take ""suck"" to a whole new level."
4,An Underappreciated Film,"Was this movie as good as the first or third? Of course not. Between the Writers Strike and pressure to get this movie to audiences, it's no surprise this movie didn't live up to expectations. But those were BIG expectations. This movie is better than it is given credit for, and in blu-ray, even better."
1,Bare Bones,"There is absolutely nothing on this dvd other than the movie. Do I now have to pay $10 more for any type of bonus materials? No theatrical trailer or anything. I just feel like this is a ploy to try and sell Blu Ray movies, which I don't want."
3,"Great product, as expected.","Received item in timely manner, it was what I expected. Pleasure doing business. Thanks."
3,A gift for my sister.,A gift for my sister. The first one was so bad I have no desire to waste 2hrs of my life.
5,Transfermers x2,"Don't be fooled by the ""nay-sayers"", it's everything the first was and more. Way more action. way more humor. I don't get the bad reviews, if you were a fan of the first. It's not meant to be a thriller, a suspence, or romance movie, just action and this movie delivers in spades. If u liked the first, then u should love this one. Twice the fun. Michael Bay did a great job on this one can't wait to see the next."
1,Are you Serious?!?!?!?,"I received the movie today, and it looked like it had been chewed on by a dog and had crumbs and cola stains all over the package. Needless to say I sent it back, and unfortunately I can only get a refund, and if I order it again I will have to pay for Shipping. Boo Amazon. This is the second item I have sent back in less than a week."
1,Too much of a good thing,The first movie was good because we finally see a live action transformers. I was not impressed with the acting of Shia LaBeouf. I think he over acted and he really slowed down the film. One way to describe this film is too much sizzle not enough steak. There are explosions and fighting robots. The two most cringeworthy scenes include a robot humping the heroine's leg like a dog and robot genitalia. Michael Bay needs to make a movie with story and not just special effects. Saldy he doees not know the difference.
2,What am i watching??,This movie pretty much sucked!!! I mean a college chick robot was retarded!! What happened to Sound wave up in space attached to the satelite just leave him there? Then they show megatron coming out of the ocean and then standing on some planet. Just stupid!! The only thing good were the special effects.
1,What a horrible film.,"Bad acting, lines, cinematography, the only good things are the visual effects and Fox's sexiness. The action was just robots bashing up each other. Gets boring after a while? Nah. Only REAL good thing about the movie.2.5/10"
1,The machine has balls,The writers are equally to blame for this POS. The blu ray looks and sounds great but the movie took everything that was bad from the first one and multiplied it.
2,A lot of grain on the PQ.,It is a disappointing buy. The picture is very poor. It is detail but a lot of grain. Not sure if this is made on purpose but I hate it!
1,I still can't believe how awful this movie was!!!,"This movie had one of the worst plots I have seen in years. The acting was ok as Shia Labouf did well, but Megan Fox (unbelievably hot) needs some work. Don't get me wrong the action was good, but not spectacular. The action scenes became too long and I found myself bored. At times I couldn't stop shaking my head as to why the dumb humans would act that way or why is this so unimaginable. I thought Transformers 1 was awesome and many others agreed. I would only pay less than $5 for this blu-ray just to have it sit next to the first transformers movie I bought last year. Visit [...] for all your true critic reviews to see how lousy this movie was. Otherwise, AMAZON is awesome as usual. Thanks!"
1,Nothing but bad,"From the frenzied, incoherent opening to the anticlimactic end, there was nothing redeeming about this waste of film/pixels/whatnot.Scenes seemed randomly sewn together as if they might all have come from different films, the acting seemed like the director simply accepted every first take on every scene, and the overall writing was at about the level of an average 5th grader.Not recommended for anyone that isn't either in a coma or already dead."
2,"Big on Special Effects, Little on Story","This movie is like watching a 2 and half hour long video game with nothing but big giant robots fighting each other and thats about it, there really isn't a story there, the guy and megan fox are fighting mostly, you got stupid jokes with robots humping legs and bad acting. The special effects are cool to look at but I fell asleep 3 times during this movie. special effects are not everything, you need a good story like the first film which was so much better."
5,Watch it again on Blu-Ray,Well I saw it in the theater and it was ok! But then I got the Blue-Ray and it is awesome on a home theater system! The second disc has so much stuff with Michael Bay doing his stuff and just so many extras from the opening of the movie it is just great to watch everything.Also after watching this movie three times it so grows on you it is amazing and awesome! Great stuff!!
4,Good movie!,Loved the non stop action. Story couldve been a little bit better thou. Looking forward to part 3.
2,Doesn't compare to the first one.,What happened to the story line? This movie turned into Megan Fox porn star meets 2nd rate character dialogue. The graphics were still great but that's about it.
1,"My God, what a bad Movie!!! This sucks in every deparment!","Too much sex, too many stupid jokes, two stupid twin autobots, not enough action, too many complicated battle scenes, ridiculous decepticon house appliances, Megan Fox looking in every scene like she is doing a porno shoot, The most ludicrous and pointless plot I can remmember in recent years...and the list goes on and one. How it is possible that so many people working on a high budget movie don't realize they are producing crap?The only good thing in the whole movie was the fighting on the woods where Optimus dies, really well done. But again like in the first movie the machines look way too complicated, is difficult to follow the action.In few words, one of the worst movies in recent memory. And the worst is you know there is going to be another one."
3,Not for kids,"This movie is replete with sexual innuendos and bad language (including multiple instances of the f-bomb). I felt comfortable watching the first ""Transformers"" with my kids but am glad for a friend's warning that I should not let them see the sequel."
3,Good Quality Movie - streamed awesome,"Good Quality Movie - streamed awesome to my PC, HD TV and Amazon Kindle Fire.Wanted to watch over again, so I would be caught up before the latest movie."
1,Not HD,The quality of the movie was not HD at all. Didn't get past the first 5 minutes of the movie. Waste of my $2.99.
3,Entertaining but just too much!,The original transformers (still waiting for my ordered copy) is quite entertaining but this episode strains the concept beyond reason (and many winks) and thus makes it less enjoyable to me because I got tired of winking!
1,Not even popcorn,"Not even a good bag or bowl of popcorn could turn this into an enjoyable experience. Special effects can only go so far. Even the worst of Bruce Lee, or Jackie Chan movies is far superior to this badly written piece of junk. The target seems to be socially retarded junior high students, I'm sorry that's an insult to socially retarded junior high students everywhere. I don't mind Caricature instead of character, but these aren't even decent caricatures. Watch a bunch of bad Saturday morning cartoons if you want to spend a more profitable 2 hours. By the way, I really liked the first Transformers movie, this is dreck. I feel so sorry for the waste of time of some very talented actors."
3,Only decent,"I really liked the first Transformers movie, surprisingly. I thought I wouldn't like it, but I did, a lot. So, I was hoping that this sequel would be just as good. I was unfortunately disappointed. There were many parts of the movie I just found to be unneccessary. Certain characters they added I kinda hated. And it failed in the humor it tried so hard to put in. The overall plot was pretty decent, and the action was good, but it just is not near as good as the first, and even if it wasn't a sequel it would still only be a so-so movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,I watched it for the robots.,"I love seeing Optimus, but the story just was awful. It's just too slow; and this is an action movie. I also didn't like the little stereotype 'joke' telling transformers. They just made the movie longer than necessary."
4,Movie good but blu-ray is made for home theater,"Fast action, sharp (computer-generated) graphics, explosive but clear surround sound makes this an ideal blu-ray disc to enjoy/showcase on your home theater system. The plot of movie itself is OK - not as good as the first one."
1,Ummm..... really?,"I'll conceded the good points of the movie, everyone agrees about those. However, what overshadows all of those good points was the Plethora of AWFUL points. Wow, it's almost as if the bad points was of such monstrosity that they were almost celebrated to the negative. And one over emphasized facets that just really bugged me in this film; every, I mean every girl in this movie was of model appearance. The stand ins, background and fillers were young, long hairs, tan girls. Which we all like in proportion, but damn... if that's all there is as a standard, beauty starts to reverse itself. Even if one contends this was to be about ""eye candy,"" eye candy becomes anything but if it is overplayed. It's sort of like the premise; one must have bad in order to have good, in anything in life in order to be valid. Ok, one GREAT point: Special Effects - Awesome!"
1,I had a pretty good nap,"I saw this in the movie theatre. And I generally like this genre of idiotic special-effects-driven tripe. But this was so bad, I decided sleeping was a better use of my time. And despite the loud continuous noises, I fell asleep anyway. Only one other movie has won such an honor- the last installment (epsidoe 3) of the Star Wars franchise. If you want to waste your time and money on this junk, go ahead, you might just have too much money or need a little nap."
2,Why do they make this stuff?,"I love action movies but hate this stuff. This movie seems to never end. A child could right this type of script. At the end of the day it's really just a bunch of robots slapping each other around. Kids should love this but all you adult fanboys really scare me. The only thing i really liked was the boys mother, who seemed to curse about anything."
2,Robots Fight,Um...that's it for 2:30 min.Acting is pretty bad.Dialogue is pretty bad.Special effects....pretty good.Save your cash and more importantly YOUR TIME.
3,Fun,"The only thing that amazed me was why would Megan Fox inject her lips. She was perfectly beautiful in the first movie. Now she had to go and ruin her face with that vulgar pout. She looks ridiculous, her mouth cant even close shut. And the awful tan - why both females are so orange? Too bad this movie got a few scenes that make it unwatchable for my 6 year old, he loves the first movie. Any sexual inuendos in the dialog of T1 went right over his head, which is fine by me. He is not watching T2 though."
2,You won't believe just how bad it is,"I liked the first movie, it was not perfect but the good outweighed the bad and it was an enjoyable summer action movie. Now, take all the bad parts of the first movie, multiply them by 100, throw in an utterly incomprehensible story which drags on for waaaaay too long and you have the tran wreck that is Transformers 2. As an adult, there is NO REASON to torment yourself with this noise.Why did I give it 2 stars, well my 6 year old nephew loves it for what that is worth!Dreadful!"
2,Two hours of explosions and fighting and twenty minutes with the characters.,"Well, at least that's what it seemed like. Whereas most sci-fi movies have characters and special effects, this movie has so much and so many special effects that they aren't special anymore. They are the movie. The characters are there just to provide a minimal vehical for a story to wrap special effects around. I'm glad I saw this in a way that I didn't have to pay for it.Oh, and Megan Fox is beautiful enough in her own right without these posed glamour shots that seem designed only to provoke teenage lust. To bad she didn't actually do more, you know, like acting and stuff."
2,More than meets the eyes? Not really.,"Here is one of several movies I had high hopes for in summer 2009. Bigger, longer and definitely NOT better than the previous Transformers movie. The story wasn't all that great and the acting was a lot worse.There isn't a lot I liked about this movie, even by seeing it in IMAX. Watching the Autobot Bumblebee open a can of whoop@$$ on two Decepticons at the same time was cool. Voice actor Peter Cullen reprises his role as THE voice of Optimus Prime (thank goodness). Right before his final confrontation with Megatron and the Fallen (which was pretty bad@$$), it was awesome to hear Optimus Prime say a vigilant catchphrase originally from September 11, 2001.... ""Let's Roll!""I've seen a lot better summer action movies than this train wreck. Director Michael Bay and the screen writers have taken what could have been an exciting sequel based on a popular 1980s franchise and ""raped"" it! Do yourself a favor and don't buy this."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"While this movie has excellent special effects, it has an incomprehensible plot, robots which for some reason have cultural accents, and some of the worst dialogue I've seen in years. Why was this movie around two and a half hours long??? I seriously cannot fathom why so many people like this movie (and the first one for that matter). Michael Bay made a classic action film in 1996 (The Rock) but he has gone way too far in making over-the-top, mindless, action summer blockbusters. Please do not make a third one."
4,"Fast Shipping, Packaging can be more careful","The item arrived quickly and well packaged. However, the box was a little ruin due to a tight fitting packaging and the way it was put into it. The Bluray was in fine condition. The movie was Great. Overall, quite happy with it and very greatful of the fast shipping."
1,Phoning it in...,"Just as bad as all the reviews have said. I really enjoyed the first one, it was great summer escapism. But this follow-up just meanders from one sequence to the next, with no attention paid to plot or characters. Even the humor seems canned, and the young lead actors are already phoning it in."
2,Disappointing,"Feels like this movie franchise is heading towards a Jar-Jar Binks type Star Wars theme. Forget the campy and stereotyped robot characters and put out a movie with a decent plot.Movie looks and sounds awesome, but the plot was awful...The first movie was 10 times better (not sure what that says actually)..."
4,DVD movie picture quality,"not sure why but the picture quality of this movie seems to be very poor compared to my other DVD's......even when upconverted, it pales in comparison to other movies I already own."
2,Not as good as the box-office shows,"When I went to the theaters to see this movie I was expecting alot, since it had already earned a good sum of money. However that night I left the theaters disapointed. The reason I felt this way is because there was not a very good plot. I think the biggest reason why this movie made such a large sum of money is because of the special effects, all the transforming and Meghan Fox.I thought there was good acting in this film but if there is not a very good plot good acting can only carry a film so far."
3,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray],The blue-ray looks spectacular in HD sound destroying my house did not sleep the neighbors ...I grieve because the box only arrived broken ...
4,nice sound,transformers revange of the fallen have good 5.1 surround sound( dts hd master audio) its nice movie.picture quality is someparts shining and normal
5,Very happy son,My son is all about Transformers! I got him this DVD for Christmas and he loved it! It came brand new in sealed plastic and was in pristine condition. It was shipped very quickly too.
5,My Favorite of all 3 but many people hate it.,"1ST. The picture quality is 9/10, the story is fine 7/10 but really? Superhero movies usually are not known for their story, rather the awesome CGI and action. The movie has action all over. Many people hated the comedy, I loved it. My fav were the two tween robots, they were funny. Amazing, my favorite scene was when that scorpion thing came out of the sand and suddenly popped out in slow motion making that spinning sound. Its so sick."
3,"Better CG, but weaker in any other count","Dont know whether I have too high an expectation or I am 40+ with high requirement for a good storyline plus good characters even in a sci-fi action thriller. For sure the production team had been too busy to show off the incredible CG. Personally I find ""II"" much less charming than ""I"". I always replay the scene in ""I"" which the US army fought bravely against the scorpion in the Quatar desert intermingled with humor of ""IDD call centre from India"" and ""the black man shouting left cheek, left cheek....send the rain"". I just cant find any scene in ""II"" that I have a strong interest to replay, perhaps except the very sexy ones of Megan Fox. I know most people who had watched ""I"" will watch ""II"" as well. So, just regard this review as an old man's mumbling. Pardon me!"
4,"Good service, OK movie","Timely and accurate shipping. Movie is OK after first screening, maybe it'll get better each time like Transformers does. A lot of swearing in the first 45 minutes."
1,Worst...movie...ever...,"I'd rather wake up with my head stapled to the carpet than to have to give up 2 hours of my life watching this utter garbage. The mindless fights aren't even introduced by the paper thin plot (when there is a plot). Most of the movie is spent watching Shia wandering around while the Autobots inexplicably keep abandoning him. Come on, any 5 year-old playing with dolls can come up with a better storyline. This movie is WAY too violent for kids, and WAY too stupid for anyone over the age of 10. Watch the terrific first movie again instead, you'll thank yourself for it."
1,Immature humour spoils this movie,"I was excited to be finally able to see this moive in the cinemas, however I was very disappointed. This movie was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen in my life (after the latest Indianna Jones). The comedy was clearly written for teenagers. I didn't find it funny at all. Steven Spielburg is clearly losing its touch to produce high quality movies (ET, Schlinder's List) with the recent misses (Disturbia, Eagle Eye, Transformer 2, Indianna Jones 4...)."
2,Good / Bad,"Price and delivery were outstanding. Packaging and DVD package were very good.Bad: The DVD is scratched badly. I would rate this ""fair"" on an optimistic day. Probably more like poor.It plays, thus far (I am currently 40% through it). And, if it continues to play, I will be satisfied as-is."
2,Explosions over Substance,"This movie is a good Example of a Successful bad Movie. This movie was just so bad, I wanted to walk out the Theatre, but due to the fact that I paid so much money to see the movie, I sat and watched it. This movie went from being something that was actually Good, to something being horrible. The first was so good and A good movie for the fam. While his one is so full of Racial Stereotypes, and Bad Language I thought it was a Rated R movie. The fact that the Mother said ""I'm going Skinny dipping and you can't say [...] about it."" The Story was Horrible...Please Skip this movie or rent it"
1,"""Fallen"" Down...","I loved the first Transformers film, and yes, I collected some of toys when I was a kid. Of course, then, I was eager to see ""Revenge"" in the theater. Let me say that the entire film was a ""fallen"" creation. The acting, lines, characterization, and plot was very forced and contrived. Buy another movie."
1,Definitely a big step down from the first Transformers movie.,"We thought this would be good, mindless fun after seeing Transformers and we wanted to see it before watching Dark of the Moon. And yes, we expected it to be somewhat sophomoric and geared toward teenage boys, but we found the first Transformers tolerable and enjoyed the story. Sadly, ten minutes into the movie we were ready to turn Revenge of the Fallen off but gave it another 10 mins to see if it would get better. It didn't, and it actually got worse. It goes beyond juvenile. You can bet we won't even bother wasting our time or money on Dark of the Moon."
5,MUCH Better than the original cartoon series,"This movie, like the first, is well worth watching over and over again. They are BOTH a hundred times greater than the original cartoon series ever was (which was entertaining and fun while it lasted) because they look so lifelike. This movie, though, will blow you away with its continuous action scenes, fantastic computer enhanced graphics, and great story line! Those guys (writers and artists alike) do an awesome job on this one. The Transformer characters in this movie look like they actually DO transform from autos to robots and vise-versa. These are the types of characters that are fun to watch on the screen but you wouldn't really want to see them up close and personal."
4,Transformers Revenge of the Fallen,Good movie and if you have it on bluray with all the bonus stuff its a must buy.
4,"Lots of action, fast paced",It was almost difficult to keep up during the fight scenes because it was so fast. Great special effects and a good story.
4,even adults will like this movie,"Really enjoyed the movie, brings back memories of when my son was little and played with them many years ago."
5,Great,Item satisfy the need I needed. Would recommend. Seller shipped item very timely and in ggod condition.
4,Transformers Revenge of The Fallen,Now every says this movie sucks or its to long well i liked the movie to me it was awesome and i can't wait till transformers 3. I think the reason people did not like this movie because they don't think it is as good as the first. i think that's because the first one was new to us the first transformer movie that was live action/ cgi movie. so when they went to see this movie it was too familiar so they might of hated it or just diliked the movie. well i say buy this movie it great and the action is great and Megan Fox is not a bad actress.
4,Long,"It's an O.K. popcorn flick,but it's kinda too long.Other than the fact that it should have been edited (for time) by about 30 minutes,it was well worth seeing."
4,entertaining,you can say what you want but this movie was made for two reasons... to entertain and to make alot of money at the bo. it has done both so far! this movie was not made to earn an academy award. it wasnt made to win an oscar for best acting and that is fine with me. i am a huge transformer fan since the early eighties. the first movie was really good. this one wasnt as good but still was legit. i think some critics need to realize that not all movies are trying to win these awards but instead they are trying to please the audiences. this one has done that for the most part. i will admit though when the third one comes out they will have to put in a lil bit more effort in the story because if not it could be a disaster!!!
4,Transformes 2 Review,"It 's beautiful slip cover. It's a great movie with a lot of special features, the sound e imagem was amazing too."
4,Good Movie,"This movie, along with the 1st installment, will be enjoyed by most fans of action or sci-fi, but especially anyone who played with the toys or watch the cartoons in the 80's. This is a favorite of my nephews (5 & 14), but, from my experience, not well liked by women in there 30s."
4,"Fighting crazy robots - 5, Megan Fox - hot, Story - ......2?","Length:: 5:28 MinsGina from Team Haunted Flower reviews Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. We love to watch robots fight each other and lots of explosions in our summer movies, who could blame us? Yes, there are gaping plot holes, but there were a few improvements made from the first one so don't know a popcorn flick too hard. Here are my thoughts and complaints.[...]"
2,Bad movie,"I think directors were too busy making a movie visual effects filled and forgot about what makes real good movies like good plot. I cannot believe this movie is still related to Steven Spielberg's good name. What is he thinking? This movie had some offensive languages and some stupid visual scenes that was totally not child friendly. How could directors or producer could have no clue what offend people. Also having so many bots, it is hard to tell which one were Autobot and which were Decepticans. Maybe making Autobot all red and Decepticans to be blue will help tell which bots are friendly and enemies. Also this movie had no good actors and actress. They are all stinks. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this film to anyone."
4,Almost 3 hours of action,"Transformers 2 was a very pleasing movie. Decent acting, action packed, and great special effects highlight the movie. The story was ok. It seemed like the story was kind of all over the place at certain pints in the movie, but it all makes sense at the end. In addition to the story there was quite a bit of foul language in the movie. There are many younger children that like transformers, so i was really surprised at some of the things that were said by the transformers. The language and the story kept me from giving the movie 5 stars. All around this is a very good movie."
4,Very good,This movie has some great action sequences and I liked this better than the first movie. The acting is a little cheesy at some points as can be expected but this movie is all about the action and effects.
1,Great kids movie except for several unnecessary curse words.,"Since my kids were three I bought them Transformers toys. The toys are age 3 and up so when the movies came out I allowed them to watch. The PG-13 is not unreasonable given the Sci-Fi violence, but I just don't understand the need for all the cursing. This movie has every word except the ""F"" one. Probably 20-30 curse words throughout the movie. The mother is eating pot brownies which is supposed to be funny but instead is just a stupid scene. Really disappointing that they have to do this stuff."
4,More Robot Animals Please!,"An enjoyable second outing in the Transformers franchise. Scene stealers include Ravage, the jaguar-like robot (matched only in ferocity byDestroy All Robotssteel sharks) and the truly awesome Devastator. Some of the relationships got a bit lost in all the action and it lacks the human touch of the original film. However the effects are truly superb (if overlong). Worth a watch (and Megan Fox gives it the extra star!)"
1,Terrible just terrible,"First of all this movie is sucktastic.Remember when you were a kid and youd played with your action figures and made up the story as you went,this is what thats like,just without the fun.The only difference between kids playing and this movie is that the kids are more mature.In summarey:this movie is a pit of suck in which nothing cool can survive,sorry soundwave."
1,Horrible Movie.,"This movie was downright horrible.The first one is awesome IMO.Why didnt they try to stick with what made the first one work, What was Michael Bay thinking?This movie grossed 400 million dollars at the box office,how did it do that?I know how,idiots like me paid 7 dollars to see it thats how.If you liked the first one dont waste your time or money on this one,save money and dissapointment at the same time."
1,Here are ideas for a reboot,"1. No more Michael Bay.2. All original voice actors, including Chris Latta edited to fit script3. Please no more government motors cars. They are only known for breaking down.4. If these conditions are not possible in live film, just make an animated film.Otherwise, I will not waste my time with Darkmoon nor any other wannabe Transformers reboot."
1,Possibly the worst film ever,"Based on the size of the film, the budget... the ignorance involved with it's filming deadline while an industry writers' strike was going on, also based on how much money this film made off of people who would do anything to get their money and time back...this movie might be the worst movie ever made. I would nominate it.Small yet huge issue -- Megatron was never meant to have a boss. Terrible. Seeing him bow and obey a master.... Uch, terrible. That's only 1 of a hundred gripes I have with this horrid film. The fact that it's being rated decently on Amazon shocks me. Not sure what people are thinking.advice: Never watch this film."
3,review,OK movie not what I expected. Did not find much of a story line and the transitions reminded me of a old mad max movie not something made today. I may have expected more because of all the advertising and toy's made around the movie.
1,skip it,"What a disappointment. Here's why: The movie starts by teaching the lie of evolution. Throughout the movie, the actors quote Bible phrases in a mocking manner. Also, there are lustful displays of women (his girlfriend and college women in dorm settings). Technology will not save mankind. Technology will not destroy mankind. Technology is lifeless. Robots won't destroy the world; God will. ""...the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"" (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9)"
2,uh......,i bought these headphones for 11 bucks seeing as that they were over the ears headphones they would stay on...well they fit REALLy snug on ur ears..but the bass on this thing is H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E...i wouldnt reccomend these.....now thats 11 bucks down the drain.
4,A gift,"When Professor Paul Keddy was given a death sentence by his doctors, he realized he had better leave something about how he looked at life for his family, & he'd better take stock of where he'd come from, where he was then & what he might do with the rest of his life, such as it was.I liked what I read, it told me things I didn't know, ideas I had already thought, practices I have already begun,As an instruction book for youngsters when they ask The Big Questions: ""Why am I here? Where did I come from? What should I do?"" IF I SHOULD DIE BEFORE YOU WAKE offers some attainable first steps."
3,Hugo in 3 months,"I bought this book because I learnt spanish with the aid of Hugo spanish and a teacher to guide me through the book. I do live in Spain so it does make things easier!So with this in mind and knowing the format, I knew I had to learn Italian next so I was very pleased when my book arrived before the expected delivery date.When the book says learn in 3 months it feels more like 3 years! It doesn't explain things very well and is very confusing, I would say that this book is not for absolute beginners. Although having spanish as a language and school french helps, I would say use this book along with a teacher."
2,Miglia TV Micro,"This product has alot of potential. The software looks good and is easy to navigate, but I had problems with software bugs using my Mac Mini 1.5 GZ with 540 MB Ram using Tiger. The software would sometimes work and sometimes not when trying to record videos at VCD quality or really any quality for that matter. When I would try to close the software app, it would lock up and refuse to close everytime. Even, Quit Process/Force Quit in Activity Viewer would not close it. Eventually, I returned the product for a refund.The tuner is excellent and design is good. I just couldn't get the software to perform to my expectations. One good thing is that the software does have an excellent export feature for use with Video Ipod or other file formats. Too bad that there is compatibility problems. Do not recommend."
3,not working very well for me,"i love the idea of tv on my monitor. i have an external monitor hooked up to my 12"" 1GHZ powerbook with 1.25 GIG ram, and i love the idea of having a small window of tv open while i work.problem is that it doesn't really work very well. after playing for a half hour or so the video begins to get really choppy, and then will often just freeze up completely. the only way to get back to a smooth video is to restart the whole system. it is as if some sort of cache is filling up.also, it uses so much processor that it is vritually impossible to use any other programs while the eyetv is open.troubleshooting anything is also frustrating because all the info is on the web and only accesible by search, so if you aren't using their terms for a problem, you will not get any search results. frustrating.pros: nice design, easy to hook up. clean software, great featurescons: does not work well enough on my setup, which i don't think is that weak of a setup, to use with satisfaction."
1,Hurts the ears AND the nose!,"Ok. Granted, I bought this blade to go over the free shipping limit when I bought something small. So it ended up costing just a couple dollars versus the shipping cost without it.I put it on my Craftsman 21833 table saw. This saw is rock solid, passes the nickel test, and is silky smooth with my Delta and Freud blades.However once the saw spun up, the blade made this horrendous noise. Not quite screeching, not quite whirring. Something in between. I had to put ear plugs in with the blade just spinning!I tried to cut a pine 2x4. Crosscut was ok. Not good, just ok. A rip cut left gouges like the blade was flexing from side to side. I then ripped a scrap of purpleheart and it burned the heck out of the wood. Purpleheart burns easily, but this blade filled my garage with smoke!This blade is banned from my saw. Maybe I'll make a clock out of it or something."
2,Concept Good,"A good concept, but a bit bulky and a bit high for our 3 and 4 year old children to navigate. Love having the lift up seat for mittens etc. Great if you have sufficient space to have one for each child."
4,Sturdy Little Product!!!,"I am satisfied with the bench. It is sturdy and the storage compartment is roomy. The only improvement which I hope could be made is the addition of another ""shelf"" to fit three more pair of shoes."
5,Great book!,"There are several recently released books on polymer clay I'd highly recommend and Judy's book is definitely one of them. The other recent additions would be Kim Cavender's ""Polymer Clay For The Fun Of It"" and Ellen Marshall's book on surface treatment.Judy's historical references to other media attest to the versatility of this amazing material and her examples are wonderful! The projects are beautifully executed and the gallery photos a real treat. Judy is a real perfectionist and it shows on every page.Congratulations on a great book, Judy. This book belongs in every polymer clay library.Donna Kato, author of The Art of Polymer Clay"
4,Expert presentation,"At first I was not interested in ""creative traditions"". After a friend showed me a copy I decided this was a must have. The photography is excellent and step-by-step instructions are clear. I was surprised and pleased by how Judy Belcher's techniques could enhance my most contemporary work and with the wide variety of ""traditions"" she presents."
2,Waste of a wonderful talent,"Jaci has a marvelous, emotive voice, filled with expression, and the first song on the cd, Como se cura, showcases her talent. The rest of the songs are horribly over-produced. Most are overlaid with a draggy disco-era beat or force the singer to compete with a chorus or ""Kenny G""-type sax riffs. The duet ""Mi vida"" is not so much a blending of voices as an irritating competition. If Christian pop must be arranged to sound like a second-class Vegas lounge act, perhaps this world-class talent can find another venue. Or maybe there are producers out there who will understand that the joy of listening to this singer praise the Creator is not enhanced by piling layers of excess over her voice."
4,Jaci's image maturing,"With ""Llegar a ti"" Jaci made a substantial mark in the crowded Spanish crossover market and with ""Mi Corazón"" she's found a more distinctive sound. Less of her soft-poppy Christian music past, more vibrant young woman -- without the need to embellish every line with 30 extra notes (a la the Cristina Aguilera's of the world)."
2,meh...,"Being a fan of ""Smaller God"" and the intro to Angel, I thought that I would like this CD... but I didn't. It lacked the edginess of the other two aforementioned singles, and was rather lack luster, in my opinion."
5,Almost Perfect,"This album is a fantastic buy to showcase Darling Violetta's range of song styles and vocal ability. The first few songs are pop-friendly tunes then the next few are nice mellow tracks, then the album rounds out with some really great complex songs. There is no obvious repetition of any song style and just listening to the short sound bites doesn't show how complex many of their songs are. This is definately an album i will listen to regularly."
2,Damaged and Sad,"The statue itself is beautiful and would have made a perfect gift for one of my family members, but unfortunately it was broken upon arrival - and really badly. This is the reason behind my terrible review. Both of the horse's legs were so far gone that any hope of fixing before gifting it were dashed. They were basically almost completely broken through, so that if left unsupported, the entire statue from the break up would lean dangerously forward.I see these sellers only have one left, and I hope they aren't trying to re-sell the one I returned to them. I now wonder at both the quality of the piece itself as well as the shipping/storage methods of the seller. It's unfortunate, because it really would have been perfect."
2,Repetitive and too much talking,"I was disapointed in this video for several reasons. Maybe the problem was that I had never done a Baron Baptiste video before and I didn't expect him to talk non-stop throughout the entire series. I mean he never comes up for air ! So if you use yoga strictly to exercise and you need someone to ""pump you up and motivate you"" he tries to do that. Personally, I use yoga routines to not only get a workout but also to relax and de-stress and someone yakking through the entire session is not my idea of relaxing. I much prefer Wai Lana's videos where she softly tells you the moves and then lets you experience it in silence. I also didn't care for the endless repetitions of the same moves, it got quite boring. I didn't count them but it seems some asanas were done 15 times, a bit much for me. Otherwise, the sessions were invigorating and effective."
4,Great product!,Great adapter for ipod. We use it in our Sienna which has an AUX jack. Only drawback.... doesn't charge the ipod.
2,Won't work with an IPhone,This cable works fine with my Nano but no sound when connected w/ my IPhone.
2,Did not work for itouch,I don't know which products this works with but I couldn't get it to work with my iTouch
2,This Thing is Huge,Beware this is not a small cable. The housing is thicker than my iPod Classic and the whole thing dwarfs my wife's iPod Nano.
1,Not compatible with Ipod Shuffle,"Thought I could use this as an adapter to connect an ILive speaker/docking station to my IPod Shuffle, but the docking station and the cable both had male ends, so it would not work. My mistake, as I had hoped it would plug into my docking station and use the other end in the headphone portion of the IPod Shuffle. The product may be great, but it's difficult for me to rate it since I couldn't use it for the purpose I wanted to."
1,Buyer Beware,"Unfortunately, this product did not work with my iPod nano 4th generation. The product description eluded that it was compatible. This was very frustrating as this was my second cable that I ordered. the shipping costs approx half of what I paid for the cable. Luckily for me, I have a friend who is electronically savy and was able to modify the cable to function."
3,Good while it lasted,"The cable worked fine for my Ipod. I enjoyed at least 6 months of music with no static or interference that I got with the FM Transmitter deal. The problem is that the cable is not all that durable and it got kinked one day...that is the end of it.Its a great Idea, but I am not buying a replacement of the same product. I think I will just buy a standard non-retrectable cable."
3,Underperformer,"This will get the job done, but it's rather flimsy, and the dock connector is HUGE and square.Go withSiK din for iPod (FireWire/ Line-out Audio Adapter)instead."
1,Does NOT work with iPod Touch 4th Generation,I bought this to go from my iPod Touch to a 3.5mm input jack on an amplifier. Everything went together OK - BUT - NO SOUND. I read other reviews where the 4th generation changed something in the OS that would make these inoperable. In any case it seems well made and MIGHT work for an older iPod but not this one. SO I have to give it 1 star.
2,Beware: does not work for iPod 3gen/4gen or Iphone 3/4,They fail to mention that this product does not work for Ipod 3rd gen nor 4th gen AND Iphone 3 or 4. It only works with older versions of Apple products.
2,defective and cheap,"Within a month after purchase I started noticing that the cable would slip a few inches every now and then. Well this continued to get worse as time went on and eventually never was able to be stretched out since it would simply spring back (once it actually retracted and threw my Ipod across the car like a slingshot). So many of these Ipod/car connectors have been of poor quality that I basically gave up on the retractable feature, which is 50% of the reason for buying the item, and just continued using it while it was in the fully retracted position. So now we have a cable that DOESN'T get moved around at all other than slightly turned to plug the Ipod in and what do you... the wires inside went bad anyway. Turn left in the car and only two speakers work, turn right and all speakers are back in business. I would avoid wasting your money on this product unless you only like getting a few months out of your purchases."
1,dislike,when attached to my ipod nano 6th gen there's no sound through my car's speakers or the boom box speakers I keep on my night table.
2,Worked really well... for maybe six months...,This cable worked well for about six months (maybe less) then the sound started cutting out like there was a short in it. I'm back to my old non retractable cable that doesn't have as good sound quality (not much difference when listening to music but makes a big difference listening to podcasts). Currently searching for something with better sound that will last a lot longer!
2,Don'tbuy,The lights are not nearly as bright in the picture. They broke within 3 weeks and are very difficult to change.
5,so good,"beautiful sounds and catchy melodies on top of a foundation of solid dance beats. Just as interesting as squarepusher, venetian snares, but more danceable than both and with great melodies that stick in my head. strong attention to timbres and detail, ""organic"" development of material. so good."
5,Oh that Fruit!!!,"This book was awsome. It flowed perfectly. Remember, nothing just happens, it's part of plan greater than you or I! I can't wait for your next literary work of art."
4,Okay read,"This was the first book I've read from this author and I somewhat enjoyed it. It wasn't a bad read, but something about it didn't set too right with me. Overall the book was okay. I'm looking forward to reading A Fly on the Wall, in hopes of it keeping my interest."
3,Umm Interesting Read,"Never read a book as diverse in language and description as ""Chocolate Covered Forbidden Fruit"". One minute I think I am reading deep erotica & the next I am reading a moving sermon that would make you ""just wave your hands"". This writer is very talented.As for the book, I preferred the first ending, I could swallow it all better as a dream."
5,"""If loving you is wrong ...who cares""","i really enjoyed the story of Thadia's and her friends and the Rev. Issac. I was completely wrong about this book, when I first read the back cover of this book I thought I was going to be reading a drama filled book about this young girl messing around with the Rev. I was completely wrong!!! This is truly a Romeo & Juliet story about 2 adults who are looking for love and find it in each other, but at the cost of possibly a friendship and a close father & daughter relationship. I have enjoyed all the books that have been written by this author. I am now reading going broke, and really enjoyed Fly on the Wall!!"
2,Erotica and Christian lit rolled into one,"I thought this book was just ok. For the first half of the book I was confused and kept reading the description on the back since it took so long to get to the relationship with Rev. Isaac. It wasn't short on drama, that's for sure. Thalia got her freak on in the first half then got her praise on in the second. The fake endings were just too much. At least there is a moral to the story."
4,I'm missing something.,"I didn't care for the first eight chapters, they were to much for me,the language was too much but from chapter nine on i loved it.I felt Colin should've been beat up,charged with rape or at least shown for the dog he was.How did he not know that Tyann and Thalia were sisters didn't they have the same last name, didn't they both live in Miami,Colin had no clue?"
4,The Bomb!,"I have never read anything from this author before, but I was very impressed. This book was very heavy and touched on numerous subjects that could be considered tabu! It was very well written and left me wanting to know more!"
2,Been there done that,"Waterbone is a studio group of two musician-composers D. Kendall Jones and Jimmy Waldo. Tibet begins where Deep Forest left off, inspired this time by life and its sounds in the Himalayas, particularly the ceremonies. The basic style follows similar lines to the recordings of Deep Forest and Enigma - indigenous sounds like gongs, chanting monks, huge horns, flutes and singing children are imbedded in a chunky mix with plenty of overdubs, funky grooves and electronic melodies. You get the picture, a ""worldy"" album for a commercial market. Very catchy and cleverly put together, but musically superficially beautiful and not well able to be sustained for the full length of the album. Still, Deep Forest and Enigma fans should enjoy."
5,"Delicious, Simply Delicious","Carter takes a now a day typical urban living situation...and keeps you on the edge of your seat, or should I say...you can't put it down until you have finished, it like apple pie it's delicious! -James Thompson, WABC Radio - NY"
3,Rinérse '- Le Mobilier,"Rinérse's most upbeat track off their debut gets remixes here from Seb K. and Ray Gun. Seb K., under his Truxton guise, pushes up the tempo slightly for a club-friendly mix and redoes a guitar part as a synth riff. Ray Gun, on the other hand, remake the track as a crazed psychedelic 70's jukebox track."
5,Space Saving design,This tub so far has been really durable and the fact that it folds up is really nice. Other baby baths just seem to take up so much space and with this one since it fold up it fits nicely onto a shelf so that it is out of the way when it is not being used. Nice and sturdy design. Good buy!
3,not bad,"works well and is strudy.sits a little low to the ground but u are using for BABYS.written by a dad,iam sure a womans propective is different.does what is say it does"
5,Read it more thank once!,If you work for a non-profit or profit making company this is a must read! Billy Shore gets it! This creative man helps all of us think in creative ways about this and future generations.
1,Factual Errors mar otherwise fun book.,"Who wrote this book? Do they know about checking facts before submitting them? The misinformation is unfortunate, but overall is a fairly decent book if you are interested in an overview of the sport."
2,"Nice idea, but the errors are numerous!","I hate to criticize this book because its heart is in the right place. Unfortunately, as the first review stated, there are a lot (and I mean A LOT) of factual errors in this book that cannot be overlooked. The most glaring, as the first review pointed out, is the ""death"" of a well-known ice dancer who, in fact, is still very much alive. Here's hoping the errors are corrected before the second printing. I'm sure the aforementioned ""deceased"" skater and his family would appreciate it."
1,Better titled the Encyclopedia of Figure Skating Errors,"Anyone purchasing a book by this kind of title expects accuracy. Accurate this is NOT. Along with spelling errors in skater's names and goof- ups in listing competition results, this title claims a skater dies in 1992 who is very much alive. I would return this for a refund except now I am planning to try to find all the errors. As an avid fan of skating this is kind of an equivalent to Where's Waldo."
2,a reader from quebec,"Book with a lot of informations, however too many mistakes for the price I paid for. Mr Malone should have this book reviewed by consulting different references available from others sources (books, former skaters, professionals, agents or researchers). I hope that, if a revised edition is published in the near future, informations will be more accurate."
3,Good for getting an overall view of figure skating history,"As a beginner skater I tried to find a book to give me a lot of information about skating and I hoped for a little bit more descriptions of different elements. Also the book is very USA-oriented. Still, I got a lot of useful information and was happy to learn that the great Protopotovs started to skate at a fairly old age (hope for me!).It also filled me in with some important issues of figure skating history. It is an interesting book if you know nearly nothing of the people in figure skating."
2,I DON'T KNOW WHAT POSSESSED ME,"Ever since 1957's classic INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, film-makers have used the scenario of alien possession on multiple occasions. GREY SKIES is one of those movies.A group of friends gather for a reunion in an isolated lodge in Michigan. Guests include a newly engaged couple, a gay couple, a player and his new conquest, and a single sullen lady with her own secret. On the first night, a strange meteor-like light impacts the nearby woods and the next day strange things start happening.The problem with GREY SKIES is its slow beginning. While necessary to develop characterization, this movie's characters and actors aren't particularly interesting. Things pick up once we realize what's going on and a steady level of suspense is maintained.The creatures aren't shown in full detail and the movie's bizarre opening is never truly integrated into the story.GREY SKIES looks nice at times, but ultimately is no match for the classic pod people."
5,A Wonderful Indie Supernatural Thriller!,"This is a very well-made independent film, and it is a great thriller! I don't usually like ""scary"" movies, but this one is very well done and quite clever, so I really enjoyed it. The ending is particularly haunting and thought-provoking. Check it out!"
4,Del treasures: scattered coins,"Finally, a collection of Del Amitri videos.. if there are others, or larger collections, let the world know! 10 videos, 41 minutes of: Roll to Me, Always the Last to Know, Just Like a Man, Driving w/the Brakes on, Here & Now, Not Where It's At, Cry to be Found, Don't Come Home too Soon, Start w/Me, Some Other Sucker's Parade.Are there more videos out there? I would think so. Don't know why they stop at ten, but this whole series from Universal seems to stop on the dime. Can I say I give it 3 anda half stars? We need more videos, and perhaps more 'hits', depending on your taste. Interviews or extras would have put it over the top. Yet let's just enjoy our Del Desserts and sit back and enjoy. Rudimentarily pleasing. In-Del-ibly delicious!...?"
3,"Underproduced, somewhat raw",This is older stuff and not really very good. Justin was still trying to be a rock star. I saw him in NYC recently and he's so much better now. His solo album is fantastic...
1,A big disappointment,"Lewin fails to clearly define what complexity and chaos mean and the jocular, conversational style of this book never actually brings things in to focus. Much is made of ""the edge of chaos"" yet it is never actually defined or examplified. What examples exist are simplistic and only erode and hide what ever the point may be."
1,WARNING DO NOT PURCHASE,The seller of this product 'lies'1. they state - multiple patterns I ordered THREE and everyone was WHITE2. they stated TWO per order I GOT ONE4. I spent over 40.00 to get THREE of these5. I have now learned they run 4 for 10 everywhere else OR ONE FOR 3.006. The going price is 3.00 for ONE or 4 for 10 - THE SAME brand is 3.98 for ONE why would I pay 9.38 for ONE????? PLUS SHIPPING???? My total for THREE of these was in excess of FOURTY dollars - then I tried to call them about this and I have to pay to send them back and LOSE the 12.00 they charged me to ship this little item that weighed LESS THAN A LETTER.Consider yourself forewarned - by the way these cooler items do work very well I bought 4 for 10 from Amazon and they are WONDERFUL just this buying experience was horrid and over priced.Search for Neck Cooler to find a NON rip off solution.Cool Downz Cool Down All DayCool Downz Cool Down All Day
4,Good product for inexpensive price,Value for the product is very reasonable and provides a simple solution for hot summer comfort that you can take with you anywhere.
3,Nice for recreation for lazy family,I'm just intermediate player and with my skills we kill one shuttlecock within 15-20 min. game. You tell me if this is ok.
2,Not for those already decently-healthy eaters,"I am giving this book two stars, though I think for some readers it will be much more beneficial than it was for me.I have been on the healthy food awareness path for many years. I've already taken out pretty much all over-processed foods. I've been vegan and I have a lot of knowledge about what makes my body unique, how it responds to foods.I thought this book might be unique in that it would provide a universal philosophy about cleansing. From reviews I had read I expected some ideas that might be applied to anyone, whether they eat a lot of processed food now, or are eating all organic, mostly vegetables, etc. Because no matter what we eat, we may still encounter challenges in our bodies that could possibly be ascribed in some way to our diets.This book was not helpful for me. It seems obviously dated now to me. I think it would be a good book for someone just beginning to get into healthy eating. I was disappointed."
2,"Somewhat vague, psychological perspective","I've bought the book but been unable to really get interested in reading it, despite the topic being exactly what I want to learn about. Two biggest downsides to me: the book is written from a very right-brain, psychologist-type perspective (in fact, the book even interviews many counselors and psychologists, which adds to that impression); and, the book pulls too heavily from a limited pool of interviewees. There are 45 women mentioned, but often the quotes are from just a very few, who may not have a perspective that interests you (again, very right brain-ish). I found myself wishing for a different treatment; and luckily, there are other books that do this more to my taste, including ""Women's Ventures, Women's Visions,"" ""Our Wildest Dreams,"" etc. If you (unlike me) LOVE right brainish, psychological ""takes"" on things, you will probably LOVE this book. It's pretty clear that it wasn't a good fit for me."
5,Wonderful introduction to creativity....,"Although I haven't done all of the ""workbook entries"", I will say this...this book is very inspiring. Reading about the different obstacles, creative outlets, time management skills the women portrayed in this book has given me insight on how to create my own creative universe. Purchase this book today, I do not think you will be disappointed."
5,Please don't buy this book!,"I really want to keep it my little secret :) My comfort, my chair side mentor and inspiration.Thank you, Gail!"
5,A fresh approach to Creativity for Everyone,"This book offers a special emphasis on listening to the voice of the feminine but is not for women only! In this book, the author, Gail McMeekin has interviewed women in a variety of creative endeavors -- the arts, the media, publishing as well as the world of commerce. What these women have in common is a sense of vision and purpose - a commitment to their unique form of creative expression that would not be silenced. A treasure trove of advice, exercises, and rich stores offers insight and practical tips. Read it, reread it, and be inspired again and again. The perfect companion for the 'creative wannabe' as you move through your own creative process."
4,Great Quotes,"I have so many this type books that my new creative outlet is how to arrange them on my ever shrinking bookshelf. This book is presented in an easy to read and to follow format. Many creative and successful people have been quoted and offer suggestions. That is what puts this book above so many of the unleash the(fill in the blank) within you books. It is honest, down to earth and do-able."
4,Good Quality Paper and Print,"It's easy to read because the pages are much whiter than most books, and the print is dark."
3,Something to Get Ideas From,"I bought this book as a way to help induce ideas for me career-wise and entreprenurship-wise. However, after reading Corporate Creativity (Robinson) and taking a course on high performance idea innovation, I was a bit disappointed. I do believe that these components set my expectations higher. It is a fast read and allows for useful tidbits, but it is mostly things that everyone already knows. Not really secrets!"
5,HIGHLY CREATIVE WOMEN,"SAW THE BOOK IN A SHOPPE IN TOWN AS DISPLAY,WENT HOME GOT ON LINE AND ORDERED.HAVE NOT FINISHED WITH THE BOOK, BUT A GOOD ONE AS I EXPECTED.."
3,A good rounded resource for information on getting going again.,I'm just getting started with this book - but I can tell it is one I'll keep around and use for inspiration.
5,A wonderfully inspiring book,This book was a great read! It really made me examine my priorities and gave me great inspiration.Lindsay Tawa
5,Extraordinary book,"I loved this book especially reading about the 45 creative women and their journeys to personal and professional self-expression! This is the perfect gift for all of the women you know,"
4,"Great trivet, or oversized coaster","These trivets, I ordered by accident thinking it was a deluxe coaster. Well, actually they are. They are large trivets suitable for pots, pans, skillets, or the oversize beer stein. The designs are subdued and naturalistic, complementing my own wood furniture. The trivet can be used by itself (with the cork bottom protecting your the surface underneath), or sitting inside the oak holder. Creative Ventures (vendor) is a great shop, dedicated to total satisfaction, and has cheerfully given me personalized service. This are a highlight of the Thirstystone line."
1,Underperforms.,"I was very disapointed with this product for several reasons: 1) the dustbin is very small 2) the main brush needs to be unscrewed to be cleaned 3) the little side brush is made of a rigid plastic that was about to break after being used only a few hours 4) but the main problem is that this robotic vacuum kept spinning around table legs and bed legs, often 5 or 6 times before getting unstuck, and once even 13 times before I finally turned it off and moved it to another spot. There was obviously something wrong with the software of the unit I purchased.Overall, this seems to me to be a very cheap and unreliable product. I am unable to recommend this product to anyone."
4,A Great collection of Apop hits,"This is a great collection of Apop songs and you have to be living under a rock if your a DJ and your not playing these guys!This release includes one of my most requested songs ever, Kathy's Song (vnv mix). Other good dance floor hits include, Deep Red, Non-stop Violence, Electronic Warefare."
1,WOW,"Should of stayed with ICOM radio. The Cobra is a piece of junk. Never had buzzing from a ICOM radio, But I do from the COBRA, Customer support from COBRA was NO help, They did not care..."
3,"Brutal--But, She's Great","Annette Hanshaw's last recordings are great, and this collection nicely organizes them in chronological order--as if it were the last volume of the Sensation series. However, the sonic treatment of these recordings is pretty brutal. To cut down on the crackle and other surface noise, the engineers seemingly chopped off much of the high end frequencies.I suppose one might not really notice this without an original record to compare it to, but sadly, these songs can and should sound MUCH better than they do here. But, there really is no other choice for Hanshaw fans, so you gotta go with this for now."
1,Disappointed...,"There are very few DVDs about Burma, so when this one arrived I was eager to put it on and... all it is - is a photo presentation with audio story about this country. If I knew there will be no live footage on this DVD, I wouldn't have bought it. The site said nothing that it is a photo presentation instead of a documentary movie... Very disappointed."
5,Smells good!!,"Really like this cologne, my boyfriend uses it and it smells so good on him. The smell is not too strong, just right!"
2,Scavenging from the Numetal Scene.....,"I've heard some of Breed 77's other stuff, and it must be said that, although its not great, it kicks this poor excuse for a single into touch. Title track 'The Message' drags along with nothing interesting happening, as does second song 'Downer'. 'A Choice has to be Made' is a little better, at least it bothers to include a slightly memorable chorus. Even this song, though, stinks of early Korn/Coal Chamber style riffing, and unoriginal vocals."
2,Big Disappointment,"I own a Kingsford grill purchased over 10 years ago. It was working like a champ, but the grill was coming apart and it's pretty crusty. I saw this grill and thought I'd upgrade. Big mistake- This thing had a dent in the rim of the top, which I corrected, but it wastes charcoal like a champ. I can't get the damn thing to go out. I'm still experimenting, But pretty frustrated."
1,Sick and perverted,"You have to wonder about the mind of someone who concocts such serial killer scenarios. I bought this book before Halloween thinking it was a ""fun"" holiday scare....wrong. It was perverted and the writer needs medication or incarceration. I don't want to know him and am glad he's not a neighbor. He is why fences were made. Not scary...just makes you want to lock your doors and NEVER buy his tripe again"
3,Thought it was going to be different.,"Thought it would be more of the Halloween spirit with haunted houses, ghosts, cozy but found it a little gritty for my tastes. But that's me. You may like it."
1,Scary book!,"I bought this book thinking it would be a nice, moderately suspenseful Halloween mystery story. Instead, it was a horror mystery! I had to skip through parts of it altogether, and when I tried to give it to a fellow mystery reader (we are always exchanging books to read), and told her what the book was about, she wouldn't take it home either. I had to discard it! If you like horror, this might be the ticket for you, but it wasn't for me (or my mystery reading friend either.)"
3,Good stuff,"She writes with eloquence, even if she's a bit of a vocabulary enthusiast. But it's basically a workbook where she wants you to do some activity to expand your horizons every week or so. Like ""summarize a newspaper editorial in as few words as possible and ask your friends if they get the gist of it"" or ""look up a new word every day"", mixed in with some brainteasers here and there.It was enjoyable enough to read and play with the exercises, but it's one of those books you have to revisit. Ideally, you'd spread the reading of it over a year or so and work through the exercises as you go. But once I start, I have to get through it.I have yet to actually implement the program as she's presented it, but the exercises are good, and no doubt if you applied yourself to this program over the year, you'd be very well set."
5,This book is my bible!,"I would highly recommend this book. It really is excellent. (I don't know the authors in any way.) In addition to this book there is one more book that I would recommend to go with it, and that is, ""Reasoning Skills Success in 20 Minutes a Day"" from ""Learning Express"". The Reasoning Skills book helps out with the part in Logic that the Brain Building Book recommends."
3,Since when is 9 a prime???,"angelfire.com/zine2/fictiononline/myworks.htmlThis book was first published in 1972. At that time the writer Marylin vos Savant was supposed to be the smartest person on earth, with an IQ of 230, the highest IQ measured on the Stanford-Binet test until then. I don't know whether this record has bean beaten or not. Anyway, she wrote a book in collaboration with Leonore Fleischer about brain building through exercises.It is an interesting book with some good, down to earth advise and some brain teasers. But to me, what made the book unusual was the curious fact that in more than one numerical brain teasers, the number ""9"" is listed as a prime. Huh???? And the book is written by - I reitereate - one of the smartest persons on earth!There seems to be no hope for us mere mortals."
5,Bang for the buck,these are very sturdy and you actually pay for two when you buy one i didnt expect that ...its nice and the hood is attached the one con is that i ordered extra large and it was still kinda small and im 5'7 so one needs to watch the sizes...o and its not very long so ud need some boots to go with them
3,satisfiy,"it seem okey , dont know how strong it is ,and how much can hold the weather , still under the the trial period ,so hopfully its hold for a long period of time."
5,Optional lenguages,Somebody knows if series has spanish option as a language ?? Not subtittles or captioned.
5,and Season 2 is................,"Terrific dvd set,love it!In response to all thequestions about if and when Season 2 is goingto be released.....it is going to be releasedthis October before Halloween!"
4,The Munsters -The Complete First Season,I really enjoyed watching the first season. This show and others from the 60's and 70's remind me of when I was young and brings back memories. Are there any plans for the release of the second season?
5,Australia says thanks! Brenton Whittaker Adelaide SA,Thankyou so much for releasing this series on DVD. Here in Australia it was my favourite show as a kid growing up.I have such good memories of arriving home from school inthe 60's and tuning in to the next episode of The Munsters.The show has so much warmth and love. The cast outstandingand the set amazing! As a kid I always envied Eddie livingwith such a cool family and wished I too could have one ofGrandpa's potions.Season 2 please!!!
5,The Munsters - Complete First Season,The Munsters is a great series that the whole family can enjoy. The first season has some great episodes that are hilarious! The only problem I had with this set was the double sided discs. I would recommendThe Munsters: The Complete Seriesit is well worth the purchase.
2,Where's Season 2...?,"Hello? Season 2? The funniest of the two. The makeup is less caustic and Gwynne becomes ""Herman"" the man/child and not quite so flat a personality."
3,another mid level rating,"because the price seems so ridiculously high. will have to wait for a big sale on this one. sorry, hermy."
5,The Munsters are great fun!!!!,"The pilot episode in color is a real treat. You get to see what the set and actor's makeup looked like in a more true to life way. However i think the show really works better in the black and white format. The pilot has the same cast members except for a sub-par Lily and a very annoying Eddie. I'm glad they recast those roles for the series. I did notice that the sound level is different on some episodes,you may have to adjust the volume. With all the episodes included on the season one it will be fun to watch!"
2,Good song,"This song ""lately"" is really good, I wish i could find the album for it....The girls of Divine sing with such strength and passion its a wonder why they haven't had more singles out."
2,Terribly out of date,"A lot had happened since this book came out, rendering the information within all but useless. The title should read ""British Political Parties The Day Before Yesterday""."
1,Absolutely Entirely Accept No Substitute of a First Rated,"Absolutely entirely accept no substitute of a first rated garbage. The whole book is copied from Hinton and Owen, Finite Element Software for plates and shells. This author obviously do not know what he is talking about. The attached software, at first sight looks nice. But when you started to use it, you find that it is a piece of spegetti code, with so many ""goto"" that you dont even know what it is doing. The code is obviously taken from Prof Hinton's research group and modifiedpurposely to make money out of it. Extreme disgust ..."
1,Publisher did a bad job,As you turn from an even numbered page to an odd number page you find you are re reading the last half paragraph to two paragraphs of the previous page. Very poor job of editing to say the very least. This printing mishap occured over 8 times through page 31. Very disconcerting!I would give this book a -1 star if I could.
1,Simply Unfunny,"Larry is funny in the way that Joe Theisman's leg break is funny. If you want racist trash disguised as ""aw shucks, I'm just being honest,"" humor then this book is for you. Of course his jokes do contain farts which I find endlessly amusing. Just not enough.Tera Delu!"
5,Best Book I Ever Read,"Like I said in the title. This book is the funniest and most thought provoking book ever. I was getting looks all of the time. I laughed practically the whole time I read it. It took me twice as long for that reason. There is a lot of funny and crude material. I also strongly suggest this book to those 17+, and don't bring it to school!!I got to hand it to Larry, Git-r-done!!!"
1,Save Your Money,"Bah, bug and hum. I enjoy the Blue Collar DVDs. I like to watch the four men when they appear on cable. However, I strongly encourage you to save your money when it comes to this book. There is no continuity. No flow. There are disjointed, rambling mutterings printed from the first page of the book to the end. I did not read it all...I skipped through in the hopes of finding some redeeming content. It wasn't there. I am returning my copy. What a waste of a tree."
4,Fun to read in a crowded place,Take this one on the plane or train or into a crowded place. It is laugh out loud funny.
2,Meh...So-so.,"I read 90% of the ""Look Inside"" review and got bored. His stage comedy is a lot different. The book is only okay. There are some things that are funny, and others that spur no reaction what so ever. The constant crack about pygmies gets old though. I'm not easily offended by this sort of thing, it just got annoying. Yes we know you believe they are just a group of dumb human animals in some wild country. Whatever. Let it go! Other than that it was extremely monotonous and flat in structure. He spoke mostly about what ""pisses him off"" or whatnot. I near fell asleep towards the end. And that was just from the review! I'd say borrow it from the library, but don't waste your money.Sorry Larry. Oh, I Mean Dan."
4,"Very Funny book, easy read.",Very funny. Typical Larry the Cable Guy material. Easy read so you finish it uick but it keeps you entertained and laughing.
3,Larry's book is good.,"I'm not the leading authority on comedy, but i did enjoy Larry's book. The one problem i do have is that i hate the word ""retard"" and this book has that word on almost every page.But enough of the negative. The book is damn hilarious, and Larry does deserve the fame he's got and is getting. He has worked hard for it, and even his book shows his talent worth."
4,Goodwyn one of rock's great songwriters,"When not out buying records, I would often go to a shop like Don's Discs in Thornton, Colorado, and just look at LPs and covers by my favorite bands. I was always amazed at how many albums April Wine released before ""Roller"" and ""I Like to Rock"" broke in America in the late 70s. At random I selected the Stand Back LP from this group of early records and was not disappointed; the album contains several terrific songs, two of which are ""Oowatanite"" and ""Tonite Is a Wonderful Time to Fall in Love."" Listening to ""Wonderful Time"" now (along with its 1994 update on the Frigate CD), I'm more convinced than ever that Myles Goodwyn is (and always was) one of rock's great songwriters."
2,There have to be better books than this.,"I bought this book because it was one of the first to be published and was available at the time I needed the information necessary to deploy an upgrade to Exchange 2003.I found the organization of the book to be poor. The most basic requirements were too sparsely convered. There was not enough information on basic setup. There was not enough information on upgrades and migrations. What information there was in these areas; was poorly explained and difficult to understand.I've not found this book very helpful as a guide to installing and upgrading to Exchange 2003. Perhaps as I migrate and begin to use some of the more advanced features in Exchange 2003 the book will prove to be more helpful. But, for a network admin with five years of Exchange 5.5 experience looking to get his arms around Exchange 2003 before deploying it; this book was highly disappointing."
1,Ponderous reading,"This book made my head hurt. The ponderous writing style of the author, and his contstant references to Exchange 5.5 (who cares about Exchange 5.5 any longer???), Windows NT, and Windows 2000, made it difficult to actually learn the Exchange 2003 product. This book is about 300 pages of content about Exchange 2003 compressed into 896 pages of backward looking fluff. You are better off reading ""Learning Exchange Server"", by William Boswell."
2,Not as good as I thought It would be...,Exchange Server 2003 isn't such a big jump from Exchange Server 2000. I thought I could get by with one book-this one-but it turned out not to be true. I can't recommend this except as a reference even then it's lacking.
1,DO NOT BUY THAT BOOK!!!,"I have already found 3 errors in this book:(and I just started reading it...)1. SRS is not even mentioned (the component that allows exchange 2000/2003 to be a part of exchange 5.5 organization and allows for move mailbox migration)2. ADC is presented as ""new with exchange 2003"" - not true - exists in windows 2000/exhange 2000 environment.3. In the system requirements, the book says you need windows 2003 - not true - you can install exchange 2003 on windows 2000 sp3 and up.Ronen"
1,I feel stupid buying it,"Although this guy is repeatedly saying, throughout the book, ""I am talking about ..."" and ""I am not talking about ...,"" at page 401, I still CANNOT figure out what he is really talking about. Because of this book, I have to be very, very careful in the future when ordering books published by Sybex."
4,Good job,A good account of how Conan became King by his own hand! Well written and every bit what i would have expected from Conan.
3,Super Reader,"Having gained the Treasure of Tranicos, Conan finds himself assuming the role of a rebel general, as men flock to his banner, little liking the insane king that ruled in Aquilonia, and his sorcerer, Thulandra Thuu.He has to fight ambushes, the wizard, and Aquilonian and regional commanders to eventually make his way to the palace."
2,Chance lost,This book was a great chance to tell a super part of Conan's life. It misses the mark by being too boring and not enough action.
1,Mac users ...,Any mac user who can afford accounting software [such] as Quickbooks is probably a professional who uses their Mac for their business. Most professional business use accountants. Most accountants use Windows.QUICKBOOKS 5.0 FOR MAC CAN NOT CONVERT DATA FROM THE WINDOWS VERSION. Thus rendering it useless for anyone on a mac who uses an accountant and needs to transfer data back and forth....
1,"Disappointing, very, very disappointing","I am a small business owner, happy using Macs and a long time Intuit user. I was delighted Intuit was again ""supporting"" the Mac platform and was one of the pre-purchasers of QB Pro 5 for the Mac. I assumed, perhaps naively, that since it was the hot new thing, it would have all the old features I associated with Quicken and all the QuickBooks options for which my accountant had been begging so he could play with my files on-line. Instead, I find that this product just doesn't do these things. No, you cannot export data in PC format. No, the accountant cannot enter the program to organize data his way. No, on-line banking is not supported. This is 2003. What small business wants to be without access to on-line banking?"
1,Very disapointed,"Realistically, there are times when I have to work with others on Windoze. Thus, I need files created on my Mac in various applications to be interoperable with the PC version of the same application (works great with Microsoft Office files). However, this is not the case here, a Windows .QBB cannot be opened on a Mac, And, altough one can restore a Mac backup on a PC, one cannot restore a Windows backup with this Mac version. Pretty lousy I say! Sorry I just cannot use it."
3,Not even close to being as good as the video,"I think the exercises in both this book and the separate video series are very effective. However, I found many of the written instructions in this book to be very unclear.The book does have over 100 large pictures. However, the pictures do very little to illustrate the range of motion needed to complete the exercise in proper form. If you have never seen these exercises performed on the video, it's difficult to figure out what exactly you are supposed to do."
4,The next lambada,"I first heard this tune in Costa Rica in February 2001 - it got everybody on the floor, and comes with its cute little dance and is the next big latin hit if not the case aleady!"
4,For Rollins fans probably 5 stars,"I'm not a huge fan of the Rollins style but I enjoy it very much. Also, the selections are a little thin on substance. It is the absolutely incredible imporvisations and solos of Rollins that makes this compilation as good as it is. There is a lot of Rollins typically stunning improvs and solos featured in this set. Enjoy.Added 8/12/07: The Milestone period was one of inconsistency for Rollins. This cream of that period has been wisely culled from that period for this collection."
2,Kim is great.... too much is missing here,"to a lot of people, Kim Carnes is only known for ""Bette Davis Eyes"". Which is a shame, as she was one of the most underrated female singers of the 80's. However, this set is missing too many of her 80's hits to count. Among those missing, ""Draw Of The Cards"" (#28, 1981), ""Cry Like A Baby"" (#44, 1980), ""Voyeur"" (#29, 1982), ""Does It Make You Remember"" (#36, 1982), ""Invisible Hands"" (#40, 1983), ""You Make My Heart Beat Faster"" (#54, 1984), ""I Pretend"" (#73, 1984), ""Hurricane"", ""Invitation To Dance"" (#67, 1985), ""Abadabadango"" (#67, 1985) and ""Divided Hearts"" (#79, 1986). Over half of her charted singles. Even tho none of those songs were anywhere as huge as Bette Davis Eyes or More Love, they were all great 80's songs that deserve exposure. Try a budget compilation (you can find plenty that have all of the hits on them) instead. Kim, if you're reading this, we'd love you to return"
4,Email Correspondence,All product issues were resolved quickly and efficiently. Fast service. Prompt and courteous service. Resolved conflicts in a timely manner.
4,I've wanted this for 10 years and....,"now I'm happy to have it.... not the best music I own, but I sure do turn it up high in the car and sing loudly! I love her voice!"
5,So Smart series is a hit in our house!,"We started with So Smart Colors, Letters and First Words and my daughter loves them. It keeps her attention and she has begun at 19 months actually saying the words and colors in the videos and knowing exactly what the images are in real life. We decided to upgrade to First Word Stories and she is finding them laugh out loud funny. She is in her toddler chair, watching, interacting and learning. I would recommend these videos to anyone."
3,Hard? No. Solid Gold? Yes.,"I was impressed with the second half of this odd pairing, Solid Gold. More of the same style on Entertainment! that I like. Hard, however sounded like a soundtrack to a Miami Vice episode. Not many bands have been able to take that post-punk sound into the dancy sort of new-wave style except for a few like joy division - new order."
2,"Same Old, Same Old, Same Old . . .","If you are already a Red Sox fan, you already know everything in this book (and probably more - much is already dated). If you are not a Red Sox fan, you won't care. Either way, why bother?"
3,nice idea - had some problems,"Just bought this unit. The design is quite nice as far as being able to rotate the vents and the flexibility to have one down, one up, both down or both up. You can set the desired temperature, but you should know that you can only set it to 60, 65, 70, 75, or 80. That's it. Nothing in between those. The main problem I have with this unit, and it is going back tonight for a replacement, is that my room is 64 degrees, and the unit won't go on until I set it to 75. And even at that, it shuts off after the room gets to about 65 or 66. To me, it seems like the thermostat is off by about 10 degrees."
5,the power to win,"HELLO !! ""THE POWER TO WIN"" IS THE FIRST BOOK I BUY WHITH YOU, I HAVENT RECEIVED IT YET, IS THIS NORMAL ?? I DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIME IS NEEDED TO RECEIVE IT. I LIVE IN MONTERREY, MEXICO. SORRY BUT MY ENGLISH IS POOR. THANK YOU.PABLO TOSCANO."
5,The Greatest Guilty Pleasure,"I'm too old to like this group, but Breakthrough grabs your lobes and won't let go. Fun, surprisingly tough, and a lead singer you will hear of someday."
3,Energetic indeed...,"A nice energetic power pop ablum, however, has anyone noticed that the rhythm guitar section in the song ""He's Enough Reason"" is a rip-off of Boston's classic ""More Than a Feeling""...?"
5,Better Than Anticipated,Lovely piece and the price is exceptional. Looks as if we paid much more than we did and it is a snap to put together. Will not hesitate to purchase another piece from this company.
5,Best little dog toy!,My dog can't live without this one - it's the only thing he wants to play with. Have to keep a backup around in case the squeeky dies.
5,Totally Radical!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this game, youre fish grown until they start to breed coins, and you must defeat all diffrent types of aliens that attack your tank, it is addictive!"
5,THE CASEBOOK OF JULES DE GRANDIN,"I read every one of Seabury Quinn's books that I can get my hands on. I am hoping more of the short stories he wrote for WIERD TALES will be gathered into book form. Jules De Grandin and his friend are the occult Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, they solve supernatural mysteries. The stories are never disappointing. They bring up so many of the old legends and horror stories and they are satisfyingly spooky! A great read."
3,Could have been better,"I expected a lot more from this book, but in all this book lacked much substance and failed to analyze in depth the many other HNIC such as Russell Simmons and other modern ""so-called"" ""black activists."" I expected the book to deal with a wider number of these activist but it failed to do so. Overall the author did do intense research on topics that were true to his heart and interest, but i expected more."
5,Awesome voice,"This CD is excellent. I especially like Dulce Veneno, Candela Pura, Dime que Si and No Me Controles. Very nice salsa music with excellent upbeat rithm. I highly recomment it."
3,Design can wash off,"I ordered 2 sets and received everything intact. However, after a single dishwasher cycle, I noticed that 3 of the yellow flowers on 6 out of 8 of my dinner plates had come off! Upon further inspection, I noticed that these 3 flowers on the remainder of my dinner plates were thickened and irregular, as if someone haphazardly dabbed yellow paint to create just these flowers (It was the same 3 flowers that were affected on all plates). Amazon sent me two replacement sets free of charge, and their customer service would have made up for the 2 stars I deducted if I were not solely rating the item itself."
5,Very Pleased,This set was such a bargain! The dishes are very pretty and the ceramic mugs are a very nice shape and weight. Everything arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
5,Fast Shipping and Great Order,I received exactly what I ordered very quickly and was pleased with my purchase and transaction overall.
1,product about....,hi ilike secret grden dinner set because design and price totaly fit in my budgt when i receve my product i a'm very happy but when i sow my pruduct i a'm very upset because my dinner set look like old i think some body used it & i bought the new dinner set but i receve old & used dinner set so i'm not happy with us......
5,Nice Design!!,This is very lovely set! Especially the bowls!! They come with a nice delicate row of flowers design outside the bowls which you normally don't found in other corelle sets!! I am still looking for matching platter and large serving bowl!! Unforunately Amazon doesn't carry them!! You can get same set of 48 pieces in Walmart as well!!. Also try the bake-serve set available on amazon which matches this one.
4,A nice set,"Bowls, and plates are very nice... just like any other Corelle dinnerware. Light weight ..chip resistant awesome finish. Cups are regular chinaware didn't quite like it. But for this price i feel its a steal... Wish Amazon could have 32 piece sets and also correlle cups/saucers sets."
5,Corelle Secret Garden,Delivered on time. No damage. Bright & light pattern. Gave as a gift and recipient just loves them.
4,Does what it's supposed to do,Got the BJC8200 a few weeks ago and have been printing like a madman...the photo magenta was the first to go low. Got the nectron since Amazon doesn't seem to carry the Canon ink for this printer. Haven't noticed a difference...we'll see how long it lasts...
2,I love Tweezerman . . .but I'm bummed!,"I think that the full sized Tweezerman tweezers are the greatest thing since slice bread but the Tweezerettes are disappointing. They are a great size(perfect for travel), but they are nothing more than a small pair of tweezers you'd buy at the dime store. I guess I expected them to be more like the full size pair with sharpened tips, instead they have the same tip that a cheap tweezer would have. Maybe that's a good thing for travel in this day and age, but I'm bummed. I'm going to unload mine on Ebay and buy myself another pair of the full sized to carry in my purse and travel bag."
4,dawn's book,"My favourite stories in this book are how Dawn Met Sunny, when she rescued Clover and Daffodil from the burning house and when she moved to Stoneybrook and did something she shouldn't have done but learned a lesson from it. This book portrayed her to have a soft side more so than a critical side which she showed in other books at times. Other good and funny parts were when Dawn glued blocks together in nursery school cause she loved her building so much, how Sunny used Morse Code to rescue her and Dawn's mother from a stuck elevator and the pretend cooking show Dawn had with Stoneybrook sitting charge Sandra before she betrayed her with snooping around."
3,Ilove dawn and the whole baby sitters club.,I love to read all of the baby sitters club books . My favourite character is Kristy. I also think Anne.M.Martin is a great author. From Catherine
3,I liked some of the stories,"I enjoyed reading about how Dawn met Sunny and thought she was strange at first but grew to like her after an incident at the mall. She learned things like tie dyeing and morse code from her. I also liked the story where she babysat for sandra but I don't like how she found out about her repeating second grade and was being unethical by snooping through their mail, though it was nice how she tried to help her with math and english. Dawn learned an important lesson from all she experienced in this book but those two stories are the only ones I really enjoyed though there were several moments throughout the book that I enjoyed like about dawn's kindergarten days"
4,ACCESS DENIED - no PC cable included with camcorder,"Well, Happy Mother's Day to me? I get this awesome DVD digital camcorder by Hitachi but no cable to hook up to computer so all you do is record digital stills but can't email or use as wallpaper on PC. So basically you get a AV cable to watch playback on your TV but digital means digital so I would like to know why when I phoned Hitachi they said they didn't have the cable either. Circuit City should have told my husband there was no way to link up to your PC.They claimed a PC kit called DZ-WINPC3(W) is generally availablebut no retailer/dealer we checked with had one nor did they carry the mini-USB B connector 5-pin type cable. Wish I had bought the SONY ( they have a connector cable included )"
4,"Great Camera, but READ THIS","Just a note for people who buy this camera. Takes great images and easy to use however if you plan on importing your video to your PC, you won't be able to edit it with any normal video software. The ONLY program that currently is able to edit the .VRO files that this uses is ULEAD personal edition. This adds... to the price of the camera."
2,Back gammon,Nice looking but very light and not hardwearing as the traditional boards. Dont think this will last too long with the more serious players or slammers. Will do as an ornamental set.
4,Beautiful set,"The wood patterns on this set are beautiful, and generally I was very pleased with it. As someone else said, the magnet clasps do not work well. One side holds but the other side does not. That is the only negative thing I have to say about this set."
4,Beautiful board,"This board shipped right away and is a beautiful set, especially for the price I paid for it. I would recommend it to anyone wishing to purchase a lasting game board. Great workmanship."
5,Hilarious,"This is the funniest book I can recall. A delightfully irreverent (and therefore challenging) account of the death and afterlife of a Jamaican shopkeeper, and his relationship with God in a very Jamaican heaven. It is full of insights into Jamaican life, and a humorous critique of American Puritanism too. There is a lot of sex in this heaven - just as there is in Jamaica - but what else is there to do in paradise? Would you want to go without it for eternity?"
1,It deserves a -10. Really poor story.,"It's been years since I've read a well written book that was so poor as this one. On p. 144 the author writes,""Personally, if it was me reading this book, I'd demand my money back."" That's the best line in the book. Believe me. I was expecting a charming story and it's a tasteless diatribe against the predominant church denominations in Jamaica. Repetitive. Boring. It was a waste of my time to read it."
1,crap,"Thought it was a live concert video, it's just individual videos (in which i already have). plus, it has no sound. wont buy from them again."
5,Willow's story is exciting and Duncan is adorable.,"This is the companion book to The Seductive Imposter and focues on sister Willow Foster. Willow uncovers an environmental danger to her beloved hometown and is almost killed trying to bring the criminals to justice. Of course Duncan, who decided long ago that he would marry Willow, is there to help. Duncan is so male and yet so adorable that is would be hard not to love this book. Duncan's secret life only adds to his charm. A must read."
3,Not her best,"I'm a fan of Janet Chapman's but this book definitely wasn't her best effort. While the basic theme of the story was ok, there were several things about it that drove me crazy. Duncan's accent for one. I'm around enough Scotmen on a routine basis to know that none of them sound like a pirate as Duncan does (didn't someone say he sounded like Popeye?) And if Willow called him ""Dunky"" one more time I was ready to throw the book out. It was even worse than the running troglydyte joke. And bringing in Duncan's family near the end just was a way to provide romantic interest for the few remaining single major characters in the book. Geez...doesn't Puffin Harbor have ANY permanently single people?All in all it made me long for Michael MacBain!"
5,A good one,"If you read this book expecting the greatest thriller or perhaps the hottest love story around you'll get disappointed. If you read it just to have a good time and to enjoy the pages written you'll have a merry time. This is the first book of the series that I read so I can't compare this book with the others, but nonetheless I like it very much."
1,This is a piece of {expletive}!!,"The memory card has 360 blocks of memory!!! Sounds great, right? Not so fast.... The memory is 8 pages per section, in 3 sections, there are 2 buttons on the top of the card for section selection. Problem # 1: you have to remove the card every time you reset or turn off the system or the card will erase all data on all 24 pages. Problem #2: the card itself is so cheaply made it may fall apart during removal from the system. Problem # 3: you have to push the buttons for section selection so hard to change pages that the card may break. Buyer beware!!! DO NOT BY THIS BRAND FROM ANY SELLER ANYWHERE!!!!"
4,My Opinion Only(Christopher P. Nelson),Every one uses memory cards diffrently. I use them in my PS2 Slim for PS games. I have no problem keeping stored information on them. Most after market or NON-OEM's are not even recognised by PS2 consels. This one is!If there are problems with this Unit a change of batteries does the trick in most cases. The old PS2 do have problems With some Of these Memory cards.I suggest investing in to date consels.
5,Great Canadian Band!! 5 Stars PLUS,"Of course being Canadian I think April Wine is one of the best!! Being a teenager in the 70's I bought every April Wine album I could get my hands on!! This CD is great because it gives a good taste of the songs I listened to on all those albums in the 70's. If you are looking for some good April Wine tunes, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed!!Of course I would like to buy every CD that I have in album from the 70's!!! Probably if I can find them on amazon.ca they will end up in my CD collection now!! This is just a excellent band and if you have never heard April Wine this CD would give you a variety of April Wine tunes. From some good ole rock & roll to tender love songs. I could go on & on about how this is a great band. Just check it out for yourself, you won't regret it!! This Canadian band rocks!!"
5,"Timeless fun -- like ""SimCity"" for buses, trains, ships and planes!","Yes, an oldie but definitely a goodie! From the same genius behind RollerCoaster Tycoon comes Transport Tycoon Deluxe, a much-expanded and improved version of the original Transport Tycoon. Build, micro-manage, and compete against the computer (or solo play) to establish your own transportation empire! Lay down roads and rails, then add buses & trucks, trains and planes, all to get passengers and cargo where it needs to go! Special emphasis on trains, with steam, electric & diesel engines, plus passenger, mail, wood, goods, coal, oil and many more freight cars. Maglev trains, Concorde planes, ferries, helicopters, too. Exhaustive details (with screenshots!) available at Wikipedia, but simply, an excellent involving game."
2,Catalina is hot stuff. Others Not.,"I can't say that this movie is a total waste of money. Catalina is definetly very hot stuff--the kind of woman a man with several graduate degrees would love to date. However, the other people in this movie are plain ugly (please keep your clothes on!). Sexual magic has a great masurbation scene at the beginning, but otherwise boring even at a very fast spead. Although I liked both movies, I could not keep myeslf from asking ""What am I doing with my life wasting money on this stuff?"""
1,Disturbing,A film that presents characters with characteristics such as these is disturbing. Cameras in public washrooms? Hard to find the attraction for this material.
3,Careful,"Don't watch this movie with anybody prudish. It's basically soft pornography, and a bit disturbing."
4,Nice Cozy,"Meredith Mitchell has been working for the British Foreign Service for years, and Pook's Common is the best place for her to move after getting a desk job. When she meets a charming woman, Harriet Needham, she knows she's found a great friend, until she turns up dead at the Boxing Day Hunt. Now it's up to Meredith and Inspector Markby to find the killer.While this was a very charming cozy, it wasn't all mystery. It did deal a lot with the relationship between Meredith and Markby. I also felt that the author described the characters a little too much, I was waiting for a murder. Overall I enjoyed this book very much, and recommend it to anyone looking for a great cozy this holiday season, or for anytime of the year."
3,Good cozy,"Ms. Granger's ""Mitchell and Markby"" mystery series is very enjoyable. She crafts as decent mystery as cozies go and I'm usually interested enough to finish the book. The plots are neat and move along fairly quickly. However, I've read about seven in this series and am having a real problem warming to the heroine, Meredith Mitchell. She's just not all that likeable and in this particular book, she's especially disagreeable. It seems that on every page she's either annoyed about something or going into some sort of snit with the long-suffering Alan. Other than that, it's a pretty good book."
2,More politics than mystery,"The English countryside, mistletoe, murder and a little romance - I thought this would be a great book. What a disappointment, I stopped after 40 pages because I couldn't take any more preaching. Unless you want to read endless left-wing rants about what is wrong with the world - save your money."
4,Excellent,"The idea of taking responsibility for oneself is becoming rare in our modern world. We want someone else to take responsibility for us. Then if we don't like the outcome we will always have someone to blame. Osho is asking of us to take responsibility for our actions and by doing so empower ourselves. This then leads to a maturity and a satisfaction that we can be proud of. But he says that in order to do that we need to have the courage to look inside ourselves and be the person we choose to be. I enjoy the way Osho goes about describing how to achieve this. It is simple and easy to read, but not so easy to execute!Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,Great DVD!!,"I love this DVD as an addition to my Pilates workouts. Do it 3-4 days a week and you will definitely see results! I especially love the 20 minute ""slim and trim thigh workout."" Who doesn't have 20 minutes a day to slim down your thighs, right? It is a simple, yet effective leg workout in which I feel the burn EVERYTIME I do it and I've see the results fast."
5,great workout,I love this workout video. It works really well. I use it a lot and my friends enjoy working out with me to it.
5,Love this DVD!,"I ordered this DVD to replace a pilates class I used to take at my gym that got cancelled. The class at my gym was the only class I found that toned and leaned out my thighs. Since the class got cancelled, I've struggled to find something to replace it (my thighs got thick again). This DVD was my solution! I love that there's 3 separate 20 minute workouts for hips, thighs, and glutes. I can do all 3 at one time or 1 or 2 if I'm pressed for time. The best part is, it really works! It has me sweating! I'm sore in all the right places the next day! I'm confident that after using this DVD regularly for a while, I will get back my toned, lean thighs. :)"
5,I wish I wrote it,"This is a book about surfcasting the way Moby Dick is a book about fishing. It's really a story about avocation, family, parenting and about how a sport can enrich our life and connect us to the people we love. And it talks about these things with none of the intellectual pretentions and posturings of other fishing memoirs.I wish I'd written it.Jack FallaAuthor ""HOME ICE"""
3,it was ok,This book starts off pretty slow and I kind of gave up on it for now. of course I had just read Steven King's 11/22/63 and that is a tuff act to follow..so I will give it a little time and try it again
4,Great book,"My child loves reading the sentences about saints and the Catholic Church. Black and white pictures but great, just the same."
4,No assembly required,"Although the box was big and heavy once it was opened it was ready to use, absolutely no assembly required, this was a huge plus for me."
3,A nice sorta-Christian album from Richie Furay,"The Richie Furay Band / I've got a reason: This is Richie's `Jesus Rock' album and it is good but not very powerful in either its lyrics or its performance. My problem is not with his faith (as I am a believer in the Resurrected Jesus) but with his halfhearted attempt to sing about it. In wanting to be one of the `Jesus movement' singers, but not wanting to offend his secular listeners, he ends up pleasing very few of either. I have friends that love this album, but I am not one of them.Three Stars"
3,for hardcore evans fans only,"Make no mistake about it, these are bootleg recordings and they are of fairly raw sound quality. The piano is often boomy and distorted, the drums scratchy and the bass inaudible. There's also a lot of crowd noise (on the first disc there's a guy with a particularly ""productive"" cough). If you can tolerate all this, and you're going to need to be an Evans fanatic to do so, these are interesting recordings, but their interest is more archival than musical, I think."
4,Excellent Music,"The sound quality is not the best that the commercial recording companies would normally produce, but it is head and shoulders above the quality of many ""bootlegs."" The music quality rearely gets in the way. Rather than be put off by so many of the reviews here that express concern as to the sound quality, just give it a listen on the Amazon web-site. This should convince you that the sound quality should not put you off of these records.I really love these performances. Evans consistently played wonderfully. Buy them before they are gone."
2,crap,read the reviews thought these would be comfortable nope I was wrong had to buy insoles to make these even worth wearing the second day.
1,Stay away from Hitachi DVDCams!,"I own a previous model Hitachi DVDCam. I have had several of my DVD's become corrupt and unreadable after I had recorded (and viewed) several videos on them. I called Hitachi and after a LONG phone call was basically told that I had bad luck and they were sorry. It is a porblem with the DVD itself and they do not stand behind the DVD's (because they are from a different manufacturer). My only option is to contact a data recovery service to get back my hours of lost video. Looks like that will cost me about $200-400 for two discs.I understand that they do not make the DVD's, but their cameras use them. If I can record my videos on to them, I should be able to see those videos again. The only way to use their DVDCams are to record onto DVD's! Save your money and frustration and don't risk losing your precious family memories!"
3,Problem with my Hitachi DZ-MV230A DVD Camcorder,"I bought a Hitachi DZ-MV230A DVD Camcorder from Future Shop, Surry, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 28th Sept., 2003. My computer OS WIN XP (Home Edition) does not detect the Camcorder, nor the recorded DVDs are detected by the DVD ROM installed with the Computer. So, I cannot download anything from the Camcorder. The Camcorder is thus useless to me though I like its picture quality and shape. No software was supplied along with the gazette and it was written on the manual that it would work with WIN XP. I wish, the manufacturer gives weightage to this letter and send me the solution."
4,Nice watch,I like the watch. Seems durable. It's stylish but the color was lighter than what my husband thought itLooked like online. Too much in the almost pink family for him. It's not pink but dark magenta....He kept it since I bought it as a gift and he hasn't had any complaints about the function at all.
5,Great watch,"I neede a watch to use on a daily basis for casual ocasions! This is the perfect one!It goes very good with pretty much everything and it's an ""all-terrein"" watch!"
1,"Two 54"" wide panels? NO. A TOTAL of 54"".","Description says ""This package contains two 60x54in panels."" NO it does not. It contains two 27"" wide panels, for a total width of 54"". Not even going to TRY to return these since it's a third party with minimal info on how to contact. Useless."
2,cheap clip,Th case was alright. But the clip is not exactly strong. I ran into the some thing hard with the case and the clipjust snapped right off. It is not replaceable or repairable so the whole case is not useless. I lasted me a whole 4 weeks...
5,Great product,Use it daily - much better than the case it comes with out of the box and is fully compatible with blackberry - turning the device (curve) off and on.Can't wait for the new 4.5 and then 4.6 OS to come out...
4,Great case,I just purchased this case. It's a very comfortable and handy case. When I get on my sport bike I feel at ease having my expensive blackberry phone inside this case. THe handle practically closes by itself. The second the phone is inside the case it locks it. Awesome case.
3,Nice Case for the Money,This case is great. It fits comfortably on a belt or strap of a bag. The latch keeps your blackberry from falling out if you run or bend over. The only issue is that the belt clip will break within 6 to 12 months.
2,Better products out there than this one.,"It worked before it broke! Luckily the return was not a hassle.Pros:+ Does protect and carry phone well+ Love how it lets the phone know that it's in the holster and automatically change profile (the holster I have now, non-BlackBerry brand, does not do this)Cons:- The unit is kind of bulky and sticks out a bit too far (due to the swivel. Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap. Hassle to put and remove phone.- The swivel moves a little too much (little effort needed to move holster position)."
2,I share the VER SAME thoughts ! ! !,"""The case and functionality with the device are nice. The magnetic closure is effective and quick to use, and if you've set your device correctly, email will open automatically as it should when the Blackberry is removed from the case.However, the belt clip is terrible. Even if you're just a bit overweight, the top of the clip will jab you in the ""love handles"" section of your sides. The clip is extended in a way that makes no sense - for leverage when unclipping, I guess, and it's terribly frustrating. Not to mention the fact that it gets snagged on things and will break. I'm on my second holster already.The Blackberry Curve is a great device. But I'm not sure there's a better clip/holster alternative for it. I wish there were - or that RIM would fix this holster clip.""THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO WRITE. So here it is :)"
2,Annoying,"The case and functionality with the device are nice.

I wish there were - or that RIM would fix this holster clip."
4,Tight fit w/ skins,If you are going to put a skin on your 8300 you should purchase the 8800 OEM holster. The 8800 is a little wider than the 8300 so the 8300 w/ a skin fits perfect.
1,The Clip Will Break.,"I really wish I had read the reviews before I bought this case. The clip will eventually break, probably within just a few weeks of regular use. I actually bought two of them with the same result. I was fooled twice. It's very cheaply made."
1,Not as good as it looks,Ordered this at the beginning of April. within a month the clip on the back broke off. I really liked the case and the clip worked well but one day it simply fell off. The phone in the case fell to the floor.
1,2 broken in under a week,"Something is wrong with these. My pearl version worked for years, had two of these where the clip fell off in under a week. to bad since its a nice case."
1,Broke within 30 minutes,"I was pretty excited about getting my belt holster. It looked like a pretty quality product and was happy I wasn't going to have to keep it in my pocket anymore.I got in my car to go to work, drove there, and parked. I stepped out of my car, and *snap*. The belt clip broke and my Blackberry fell to the concrete. At least the case protected it from the fall. But the plastic belt clip is worthless and makes this product unusable. I got about 30 minutes of usage out of it before it broke. And mind you, I'm not even overweight. It was on my left hip, I stepped out of my car to the left, and it broke. Very unhappy."
1,More Broken Clips,Just want to add to the list of failed clips. I had one of these cases as did one of my friends. Both broke at the swivel in less than a month. Nice case but defective design.
1,Awful,This product was not a real Blackberry product. The phone didn't even fit in it. I think I threw it away.
3,Blackberry case review,"We have been using this case for a couple of years now. Other than the fact that the swivel and clip keep on breaking off, it's a wonderful product. The phone never falls out of it, it is always secure in place and very convenient. It also looks nice and professional. I wish they would just fix the clip so it won't break all the time and that way we won't have to rebuy the item every few months."
3,Not too bad,I've had it less than one month and a piece of the leather has torn on it. Other than that it's okay.
1,Disappointment,"The order did not get to me within the range it was supposed to be to me. Once I recieved the product it was not even the correct product I ordered. It had no Blackberry anything on it...that was my whole purpose of getting this case. The leather case I received was very plastic looking and the swivel clip was not removeable, nor does it move easily. It is a struggle for me to even twist the clip."
4,don't play to ruff with it on,This clip is good but just don't play to ruff with it on the clip part will break
3,Shipping,"The product is great but the shipping was more than I paid for the product. Price was right, fast delivery but would have liked a less expensive shipping option."
3,Good enough for its price,"The quality is pretty good except the BlackBerry logo on the flap cover fell off after using it for a couple of weeks. For me, it is stil too bulky. Ideal for clip on a belt. Not the best choise for a girly girl."
2,swivel clip broke within 3 months of use,great functionlity and worked as needed. But just need to last longer.I used plastic holster came with 8700g for over 2 years and it's still working. but swivel click on this one broke in 3 months.I will not replace it with same holster.
2,Blackberry Holster,I found the holster too small for my Blackberry and I nearly lost it as it came out of the holster on its own.
3,Nice case but broke to fast,I like the case but a crack appeared on the plastic cap that holds the rotating clip on. It broke of after a couple of weeks and is now less useful than case that came with the blackberry.
2,Poor belt clip design,"This otherwise great product is overshadowed by the poorly designed belt clip. I have had multiple belt clips over the years but none as difficult as this one. At first it is just too tight to easily affix to the belt. Over time, the leather separates from the internal metal clip and it gets even more difficult to use. After owning this item for less than 5 months I am ready to throw it away (and in fact will be doing just that as soon as I get a replacement product)."
1,Buy lots of spares,"The case is outstanding in the leather portion, but if you have any job or hobbies that involve climbing in, on, or around tight spaces expect to break the clip off the case; numerous times. The other downfall is the Blackberry requires the magnet in the case to lock the phone on holstering, finding aftermarket cases when your on the road all the time is inconvienent so you have to go back to the closest carrier store."
1,"very nice case, very poor clip","As a case, this product is excellent -- nice leather with magnetic latch -- protects the phone very well. As a clip-on holster, this product fails miserably. Broken clips on two cases in six months convinces me that I won't be purchasing this product again. The plastic swivel is too weak and any bump at all makes it snap.Re. the suggestion from a previous reviewer that one place the phone inside a pocket and clip it to that pocket -- why have a clip at all? If that is the plan, why not just buy a case without a clip?"
1,Life Expectancy - 3 weeks,"The case is great, looks good and does its job... for about three weeks. The first case broke in two weeks time at the clip, Amazon was great about replacing it. The second one broke just after four weeks. I would typically expect a case like this to go for $20 and made of higher quality. But since i'm seeing it being sold for under $10, i'd say its fair to say someone cut serious corners on quality.And here's the kicker, there isn't another case out there, that looks this good and works this well ... that is for the three weeks it will last."
1,Blackberry Curve Holster already broken,Curve Holster lasted only 3 weeks. Belt clip is held on with a cheap welded plastic button that didn't hold. Don't buy it. It's like throwing your money away!
1,"I bought 2, 1 didn't work that much and broke fast (unhappy)",It seems to me that the mechanism is very weak. I lost my money with one of the two I bought.
1,product shipped did not match picture or description,I ordered leather case in black for the BlackBerry Curve and AccessoryWiz LLC did not send the Leather Case that is described or pictured. It appears that the case that was sent is the right fit for an earlier and physically larger BlackBerry. Very Dissatisfied.
2,blackberry holster,"doesnt stay clipped to my belt, falls off easy. hard to get my blackberry out. Wouldn't recommend this product. took way to long to get."
2,Not so great,This holster is too tight and caused the phone to dial when inserting and removing it. After 2 days of stretching it out it's better now.
3,"Quality below expectations, but considering the price is ok.","The quality of the product was lower than of the same item that I bought previously at [...] (the skin of which the holster is made is not that shining and soft). However, considering the low price ($[...]), the item is acceptable. Nevertheless, if look for a real good quality product, get yourself the holster at [...] for $[...]."
2,Anyone make one with a metal clip?,"Like a number of other reviews, the clip on my holster failed. This was after just 4 months of use. Couldn't the manufacturer make the post and cap that allows the holster to swivel out of aluminum? This part should not be failing after just weeks or months of use. I had thought of purchasing another of this model but after seeing all the negative comments on them breaking, I'm not throwing good money after bad design."
2,Clip Broke Within Week,"This is probably the cheapest option for storing your blackberry clipped to your belt; I would sooner keep it in my pocket but don't have the room since I carry a separate cell phone. The case itself is pretty nice, and the magnetic clip holds well enough, but the clip is very cheap.Mine broke within a week just from carrying my laptop bag. If I walked briskly or went up/down stairs, the bag would swing into the holder. It wasn't even noticeable until the clip gave in and broke off, about five days after purchase.I think that having a swivel-style clip was the trade off for a durable product. I would recommend a better solution if you're like me and need to keep your BB out of your pocket."
2,clip broke,I loved the product for the first four days until the belt clip broke. Now it is of no use. After I got out of a vehicle I noticed my phone missing and found it laying in the parking lot and the belt clip broken.
4,Good Product,We have a Corporate Account for our communications needs and did not like the hard case that came with my Blackberry so wanted one that looked more professional. This case is simple yet sleek and protects it well. Couldn't beat the price.
4,8300 Leather Swivel Holster,"Great Product. Magnetic Clasp is very secure. Made of good quality leather. Swivel function gives a full range of carrying options from vertical, to diagonal to horizontal.Only negative is that the Belt Clip is very large and may poke you in your side when you sit down."
1,nice holster terrible clip,"As have many of the others reviewed here my clip broke after 3 weeks so don't waste you money on this one,"
5,"New product, great condition","The blackberry case was delivered in great condition, packaged in sealed plastic. Exactly as I wanted and in a reasonable amount of time. Thanks!The leather is very soft to the touch, and the clip is strong and rotates to 45 and 90 degree angles. There is a groove on the inside to protect the trackball as well as the ability to activate preset profiles on the phone. The phone can be inserted facing in or out. Great product."
3,Causes init to dial,"Placed it in and it redials last # called. have to lock it to keep that from happening, and that stinks! Like the nylon one I got at Wally World better."
5,Blackberry Curve hoslter,"I recommend this holster as an alternative to the in-the-box holster. I also like how you can adjust the holster. Although a little bulky, it serves its purpose nicely."
4,Great price,"I have broken two of these already - of course for this price I ordered two of them, paying the price I would have paid for one of them had I gone to an AT&T store or gotten directly from BlackBerry."
2,Nice leather case - bad clip design,"I have purchased 2 of these in the past 6 months...both have the same death with the clip breaking off of the case at the round base that is affixed to the clip. Why is it that my RAZR case can flex and still be working after 1 year while this can't? Plus, the magnet feature doesn't work as reliably as the original RIM case..it's as though it's not in the right part of the case. Great price for the case, but I won't be placing any more investment into these unfortunately."
4,Good case for a good price,This is a good case and I have tried a couple. The clip is strong and the leather is soft and clean.
1,Looks like the original but is not,The original one is bigger and the phone fits better.Last time I buy this product.
2,nice case if would last,"I really liked this case but the swivel broke after just a few months of occasional use. Usually I use one of those rubberized skins but when I traveling I used the case. So if you consider a case for your phone as a consumable item that needs to be replaced every few months, I guess this would be good. Fortunately it's not too expensive."
3,Servicable holster - but one problem,"Works well. Nice finish. Strap holds phone securely. Would rate higher, but for one issue. Plastic from belt clip rises up above the back of the holster about 2 inches. Even when the holster is swiveled at 90 degrees, the plastic clip still sticks up above your belt line. Can be uncomfortable in some situations. But for that, I am very happy with the holster."
1,"Nice case, very poor belt clip design",Case holds phone perfectly. The belt clip is made of plastic and broke after five days of use. I can not recomend this product. Look elsewhere.
1,More Clip Problems,"I have to echo the problems with the clip. I own a construction company, and I am constantly getting in and out of my vehicle. In addition, I take probably 20 calls per day. I went through two cases in about 3 weeks. The clip is great. The case is great. The attachment between the two is just not robust enough for real use. I am looking for an alternative."
1,My 4th one....,"You get what you pay for, these things don't last longer than a couple weeks and break incredibly easily. I've gone through 4, until realizing that I'm an idiot thinking that if I'm more careful the next time they won't break. These things are incredibly cheaply made."
1,Leaky batteries,I purchased the BC-900 charger and got a $2.99/4-pack deal on these batteries. The charger came with 1 pack and I bought 4 more packs. 12 of the 20 batteries were leaking in the shipping box. At $2.99/pack and no response from the company they will be going straight to the recycling box. Don't buy these batteries even if they are free.
5,Best ever,"These are some of the most imaginative and delightful books ever. Not just for children-but for most adults, if they look closely, can find themselves in these wonderful creatures."
3,Cute but hard to breathe,"The mask is very cute on, for older kids possibly five and up, the mask is big and extremely hard to breathe out of. It gets warm in there. Good for about two minutes of play."
4,A fan of Nathalie Baye,I saw this movie on Netflix; I enjoyed it so much I bought it. Wish I could get the soundtrack; I liked the rap 'Gigolo'. A good film; recommend it.
4,An Excellent Resource for Studying the Synoptic Gospels,"This is a handy reference for studing the related texts in Matthew and Luke. It pressuposes the idea of Q, which is a theoretical common source used by Matthew and Luke. It also gives other parallels from Hellenisitic sources and early Christian documents. It includes both original languages(mostly Greek)and English. It also includes brief notes giving the differing opinions of scholars on the relationship of Q to each parallel. Since it deals mostly with primary source materials, it is useful for anyone studying the Gospels. The layout is extremely helpful for studying various forms of parables and pericopes."
2,More MS than Legal,"I was greatly disappointed with this book. While it may be a nice reference to MS Office, its uniqueness for the legal aspect was poor. I expected to see some key elements related to the specifics of legal writing (setting up specific styles, conventions and fonts - cf. The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation). I was not interesed in the stuff on the CD and the one Word document I looked at --""Sample pleading.dot"" -- used the tab to align text! It would have been far more effective using a table or even the margins. I sure wasted my money on this thing as I am proficient in Word (above in the other MS Office products). I had hoped not to have to reinvent the wheel, but I think I can do a much better job on my own."
4,More History than Instruction,"This book is a collection of historical documents about qigong, massage, and some herbs. From a historical point of view, it's a very interesting book. From the point of view of ""what should I do now,"" it's less valuable. Some of the advice--how to induce vomiting, for example--seem pretty dangerous to me. The qigong postures are described and illustrated, but the description is short on detail, and the illustration are period line drawings that are lacking in anatomical specificity. If you already study qigong and are interested in the history, it's a great book. If you are a beginner looking for instruction, make sure this isn't your only book.Susan Lynn Peterson,author of Western Herbs for Martial Artists and Contact Athletes"
3,Pilot for a StoogesTV Show that never was,"This is not a Columbia short but a failed pilot. It is similar in length and comparible in quality to the ""average"" Shemp shorts of the period. It can't really be placed at the level of the top Shemp shorts such as ""Goof on the Roof"" ""Heavenly Daze"", etc. It would have been interesting if the TV show was picked up. Maybe after a number of episodes, the writers would find a rythm with the Stooges.As a Stooges fan, I recognize that Curly is the best ""third Stooge"" but I like Shemp, too. Too often, Shemp was burdened with inferior material and cheap remakes but every once in a while, they'd hit a home run with Shemp but nowhere near as regularly as they did with Curly. This pilot is another example of this: it's pretty good with a few laughs but you probably wouldn't place it in the top 25 Shemp shorts."
5,nice,Completely plug and play. I have a Mac and a PC and I use the two simultanously to browse the net and this switch works smooth.
5,Great network switch,"I bought two of these to facilitate connecting my Dish receiver, Blu-Ray player and TV along with my desktop computer to the router. My Motorola router only has one port so I ran a short cable to one of these switches,connected the desktop computer to it and also ran a 75' cable to the second switch at my entertainment center. Everything now has access to the internet and is working great."
5,Can't go wrong,"This is great! I needed two Ethernet ports in my home office and this does the job.It's small and for the price, you can't go wrong.This item shipped fast!"
4,Can You Learn to Table Tip,"Years ago, I became interested in Table Tipping. In checking, on amazon I discovered Angela Mattey's book. I used this book to learn the proper way to begin. The book is simple, straightforward and an excellent way to learn. Through the years I have purchased this book several times to give to others who had the same interest in table tipping. I found the material as a beginning point and at time to time refer to it. Anyone with an interest in physical mediumship will want to evaluate this area of spirit communication. For those with further question. Angela has a web site and is easy to contact. Dinah Harrison Arnette is the author ofNever Alone - A True Story"
2,Don't buy this book,"Book reviews should help people who have not purchased a book to make a buying decision. If you like frustration, like researching information in books and checking it for accuracy as if you were the author, go ahead, buy the book. But if you want a book that prepares you to take the OCP exams, buy something else."
2,Fire the editor.,"This book is comprehensive and easy to understand, but contains many errors and contradictions. The Excercise questions are often vague or outright wrong. Furthermore the answer is just what letter is write with no explanation.My advice go elsewhere. I hear SYBEX is good."
3,Not Good Enough,"It is a decent book. I believe using this book alone you will not pass the test. Unless you have been working on oracle for a while. I used this book as supplement of the Sybex study guide. The practice exam questions were helpful. I passed my exam (1z0-001) on March 29, 2004 relying on the Sybex Study Guide. I would not recommend this book to someone new to oracle but I can recommend that as second reference.I give 3 stars."
1,Extremely weak,"Poorly organized and filled with errors. Oracle Press has better titles, use one of their other books to prepare for the exam."
4,Enough to Pass the Exam,There are errors in the book.But the material covered in the book is enough for passing the 1z0-001 Exam .I used only this book considering that it is from oracle press and have no prior oracle experience.Passed with 53/57.XYZ.
1,It IS John Barnes,"I Just wanted to clarify that the review below is erroneous and this is, in fact, the same John Barnes, as explained in a note from Barnes on the Amazon page of the first Time Raider novel, Wartide. The text of the note is as follows: The author, John Barnes , July 31, 1998 I really am the same John Barnes. No kidding. Wartide and Mother of Storms are both by me. I write a lot of different stuff. I am reminded of the story of Picasso wandering through a gallery and pointing at one of his own paintings, and saying ""That one's a fake."" A friend with him said, ""But I saw you paint that one myself!"" Picasso shrugged. ""Sometimes, I paint fakes."""
1,Not the real John Barnes,"This book wasn't written by the same guy who wrote all the Sci-Fi tales. He has the same name but it isn't the same guy.Poorly written is being nice. This is probably the worst book I've ever had the misfortune of buying.I made the mistake, I thought it was the other John Barnes. Don't do the same. You have been warned."
4,Great book! Read all three! Like to see more!,"I think the premise and story behind the Time Raider Series is awesome! John,please continue your stories and don't let a few bad online reviews discourage you from revisiting it!"
5,"After Bugging out, the Straw Hat Crew must deal with lies, many lies....","Volume 3 of One Piece picks up where Volume 2 left off, with Luffy and Zolo and Nami set to finish their epic battle with Buggy the Pirate. The Straw Hat Crew sets sail afterwards and quickly encounters more danger, this time in the form of an isolated island inhabited by a mysterious character. I have to admit that I really liked the Trial of The Forest interlude in this volume, as it speaks to the high moral character of the Straw Hat gang. Luffy is a pirate, yes, but his strong core beliefs always lead him to do the right thing.This volume also sets up the Usopp the Liar story arc, introducing another major character into the mix.As usual, the art is over the top, the violence is outrageous, the humor is off the cuff, and the plot careens wildly from one situation to the next. It's awesome stuff and you can't help but be swept along for the wild ride. Get Volume 3 and keep sailing!"
5,So many ideas...so little time!,"As a teacher of 2-yr olds, this is one of the best books I have found!! In fact I originally borrowed it from our local library and had a problem taking it back so I purchased my own! Thanks to Pam Schiller for another hit!"
3,A little too much for one child?,"I purchased this book to give my nanny a resource for taking care of my 15-month-old. It is a bit more suited for a daycare than a nanny, as it has lesson plans for large groups of children. Although, there are some interesting suggestions and I like the way the book is organized. Not a waste of money or time, but I wouldn't recommend this as the only toddler activity book to purchase. This one might make a good extra book. I would recommendThe Encyclopedia of Infant And Toddler Activities: For Children Birth to 3as a starter book."
3,"Not one of his best, I'm afraid","This is a bit silly, and certainly not one of Simenon's best efforts. I was a bit disappointed in it, and couldn't recommend it. He did better elsewhere."
3,OK If you enjoy old movies,I really enjoy old movies and amd familiar with Pinky Tomlins life. The movie is very weak but I enjoyed it simply because Pinky was in it.
3,Swing it Proffessor,The film has some good stuff in it. Worth it to see Pinky Tomlin. Not his best still some fun in it.
3,Strictly for beginners,"A good starter for newbies, and hopefully one that will help fill the gap between the baffled new user and the huge, daunting and badly-indexed eBay Help section. Half the problems on eBay happen because of lack of understanding of the basic system, and this book will be a useful tool if you're learning. It also covers a few helpful areas such as simple HTML for auction listings in addition to being a primer for eBay's system. There is nothing much here for the more advanced eBayer; still, this book is ""for Dummies"" so that's to be expected. It will help you learn the basics and elevate you from ""dummy"" to at least ""advanced beginner"", though there is no substitute for experience - don't forget those message boards."
3,EBAY for DUMMIES,This is so basic believe the next level Ebay for Dummies would be more appropriate for anyone who is computer literate.
1,"EBay for Dummies, Fourth Edition",This book has a lot of info which frankily is just a bunch of common sense that one can figure out for one's self. It really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.That's why I returned it for a refund.
1,Very out of date,"Like other books in the ""...for Dummies"" series, this one is well written, informative and fun to read. Unfortunately, it is also very out of date. eBay has changed SO much since it was published that, for me, it was a waste of time and money. I had been an eBay member for about a month when I purchased the book. I had learned the basics simply by participating in the eBay community. What I wanted was not the most basic information, but rather some advanced knowledge, and that was completely lacking. So my advice would be if you understand the basic workings of eBay, go elsewhere for more subtle and/or advanced information. If, on the other hand, you simply want to literally learn how to join, log on, bid or other extremely basic actions, this might be a good book for you. And did I mention I know where you can buy a barely used copy of this book for next to nothing?"
1,big disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was rambling, covered subjects of little interest (example: how to ship, post office, UPS, FedEx, etc..) but DIDN'T say anything about how to post a picture of your auction item, how to link to a personal web page, or how to start an eBay store.Less than one star in my bookJeff CampbellHouston, TX"
5,The only guide any eBay user needs!,"eBay for Dummies is what really got me hooked on the company. I have had the privilege of buying from and selling to many people I don't even know so I can enhance my coin/sports/whatever collection or just make a few extra bucks. Marsha Collier writes this book with everything you need to know about being an eBay loyalist without the technical jargon. I'll be able to enhance my buying and selling skills as time goes by, and all the info I need is here in this book. Well written!"
5,TOP OF THE LINE,"Without a doubt this is the most clearly written book in the ""Dummies"" series.Ms. Collier has captured the essence of Ebay and provided an easy route from Tenderfoot to Turbo-Ebayer in a quick and entertaining read.The section on accounting is particularly well written and I highly commend it to your attention.If you buy any book on Ebay, buy this one."
5,absolutely wonderful book,"It is filled with helpful information and links. I was so scared to start using ebay, but this book has set my mind at ease. Thank you so much..."
3,Truly a beginner's book,"I've been selling on Ebay for a while and I picked up this book hoping to find some help with making my selling work better. That is really not the focus of this book so I can't fault it for not finding what I wanted. However, if you're a newbie to Ebay and want to find out what's going on without actually logging on and clicking all of the buttons, then this is a good starting place. Like all ""Dummies"" books it covers the basics but doesn't go very deeply into anything. And truthfully, you can learn 98% of what's in this book just by logging onto Ebay and clicking around. Ebay really is pretty easy to use. Oh yes, like most Dummies books they load it down with lame jokes. I just wish they'd leave that ... out. In summary, not an outstanding book but good at what it's designed to do."
5,Not just for Dummies - a fun reference,"Ebay is great for buying things and I have been selling a few items. This book covers all the little details that are easy to forget. I find myself jumping around from chapter to chapter, looking up things I need to clarify. The answers are all there, and I keep the book next to my computer. I'm selling more on ebay now, and the tips I got from the book are helping me get higher prices for my items then I did before. Even though ebay is constantly changing - this edition is updated with all the new features."
4,Great book - Missed one critical tool,"This book is very well written and will give you a lot of instruction on how to use eBay that will save you lots of time. To find out how to sell products on eBay I would recommend Marsha's other book Starting an eBay business for Dummies in addition to this one. I recently became a millionaire buying and selling on eBay in my spare time in addition to my academic work and I can tell you its not that hard. You do have to know the secrets though and this book includes a lot but left out the biggest one. There is a software tool called www.powersnipe.com. eBay auctions are often lost in the last few seconds of the auction because the majority of people wait until the last seconds to place their bids. This tool bids for you at the last second and ensures you win, a big time saver and the biggest key to success."
2,eBay for Dummies,"I am disappointed with the structure of the book, as it doesn't detail what I needed to know - even how to upload pictures. It is not for Dummies, a complete beginners manual. I should have been more thorough in reading other reviews."
5,Simple and precise,Excellent book with lots of knowledge simply put. Will come in handy with the many questions I will have with starting a business.
5,Best Maps seen for Tokyo,"The size of the book is not the best to be carrying with, but definitively If you plan to spend many days exploring the city, this book is a must. Probably, you can get some maps in the hotels or tourism's offices, but believe me these are not enough detailed to rely on them or to find an important spot after a long walk. Sometimes, the maps show importants places as shops and buildings that are very useful as reference in your walking tour. Otherwise, even some reviewers have reported that maps are not updated, I did not have problem with this. To conclude, this book will be very useful for you if you plan to have a long stay in the city, for a short stay is optional."
5,Don't Navigate Tokyo Without This,English AND Japanese in one detailed map book. Essential for getting around Tokyo without getting lost.
5,Very useful,"The Tokyo City Atlas isn't critical for the average tourist, but is very helpful if you want to dive deeper into the city. On a recent vacation to Tokyo, I lent my copy to my brother who lives north of the city. He didn't want to give it back. This atlas makes a great gift for friends and family living abroad near Tokyo."
3,"Good, but NOT Great","You are kind of stuck. You need a map like this to navigate Tokyo, and this is the only map of its kind on the market. In other words, you pretty much have to buy this book.Unfortunately, as good as this map is, it still fell short of my needs. Too often on my trip, I found myself travelling in neighborhoods just slightly out of range of the map's detailed sections. There is a similar map made for London, which I have used in the past. That map is far more extensive and detailed, so I think my standards were set so high that this Tokyo map, while decent, is still too limited for me to declare it a 4 or 5 star publication."
4,Very helpful.,"You won't get lost with this atlas. The best thing is: all exits from subways are numbered, so you will always find the right way out. I highly recommend it."
5,An extremely useful item in an extremely confusing city,I purchased this atlas on Amazon after reading many postive reviews for it on travel sites around the net. I was not disappointed. Extremely detailed maps helped me know exactly where I was during my whole trip. It even helped me decipher the confusing address system!I actually ended up recommending it to some Tokyo University students I ran into there who said that even they get lost.I highly recommend this to anyone navigating this city for any extended length of time.
4,Buy if you are moving to Tokyo,"I'm just repeating what other reviewers have already said, but this map is indispensable. The train stations here are massive and this atlas labels all of the different exits using the same system as the train stations do so you know exactly what exit to take. Also, it has all the block & ward numbers so you can find where you are pretty easily.The only disadvantages are that there aren't detailed maps for more areas (but Tokyo is huge, so maybe more detailed maps will come out in the 4th edition) and that sometimes places you want to go fall on two different pages and so you have to flip between the two. I don't know how this could be avoided though.Anyway, I am very happy I bought this atlas, I carry it with me everywhere. I would recommend buying it before you arrive in Tokyo, although there are places you can buy it here (but how would you find them if you didn't have this atlas?!)."
4,At the advice of others,"I recently went to Tokyo. Before I got there I thought I'd be lost if there was no way to figure out the somewhat strange addressing system in use there. Well, as it happened, you can get lost just the same (especially if you're looking for an establishment that closed two years ago!). I think the map is quite good but one has to keep in mind that if one is lost with the map, it's as good as not having a map if you can't speak Japanese."
2,CaptMorgan1670,Outrageously expensive for such a small book. It does provide a good couple of points that vindicate Morgan's reputation. For the hard core fan this is an ok read. (...)
3,"So far, so bad","I received a Breadman Pro (TR875) for Christmas, along with a bread machine cookbook. The book that comes with the bread machine really doesn't have many recipes or explain the cycles well. I tried to make a loaf of banana bread. The instructions said to use the Quick Bread/ Cake cycle. The closest thing I could find to that on this machine was the Super Rapid Cycle so I used that. The loaf looked and smelled great but when I took it our of the pan the center of the loaf still looked like batter and the whole loaf fell apart. What a disappointment. I have other recipes that call for the Quick Bread cycle and I have no idea how to handle these, and am wondering what exactly is the Super Rapid Cycle for?"
1,Buyer Beware,"Received this item today and was initially impressed with its look... however, upon further inspection I saw that the top of the machine was clearly scratched and smudged. The entire face of it looked as if it had been rubbed with a solvent of some sort. The top wobbled and the seals are questionable, at best. Overall, this appears to be a poorly made machine, even if it had been received in ""new"" condition as I had expected to be purchasing it. If this was indeed a new machine, then I must say that the factory appears to be having some production issues as the appearance was not something that was in any way remotely new. As a result, I have sent the machine back to Amazon for a refund and will be searching for another brand of breadmaker."
4,A gift for our daughter-in-law,"This was bought for our daughter-in-law (our son just enjoys the results). The report we have had back - from our son - is that it made a very good loaf of bread. As we were back in the UK before it was tried, we can't testify."
2,nice design but did not hold up well,"I have owned this bag for several years and was initially very happy with it. The design is perfect. It has space for everything we needed. However, after very light use, (maybe 20 performances a year), it started to fall apart. First the plastic clips broke. Then the zipper broke and finally the fabric began to fray so badly that the bag is virtually unusable. I really cannot recommend it."
4,The Fox-Alive & Well,"Thanks Biography channel, you've done it again. Keeping the memory alive with a totally inclusive retrospective has become a crusade for you and we the real fans appreciate it."
5,classic album!,"This album is a classic! I've had ever since its release and still enjoy listening to it to this day. Ever since hearing ""I Cried The Tears"" and ""I Like It"" on the radio, I have not stop listening to Jomanda. They sing with real feeling and emotion on each song especially the heartfelt track ""After All This Love.""That song makes you want to cry. Jomanda sings more R&B on this album than their previous which was mostly dance music. Cheri sings the lead while Joanne and Renee sing background and their voices work so well together. If you don't already own this CD, then I'd strongly recommend you make it your next buy!"
2,Not great.,"I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my parents, who are retired and do alot of traveling. I thought that it would contain lots of great tips. However, I was wrong. Alot of the ""discounts"" we already knew about, or could get through our insurance(AAA) at any age. Alot of the discounts were so small that it really wasnt worth the time to even try to get them. My parents are not into traveling in large groups either, so that ruled out a large portion of the travel discounts. I did not find much useful information in this book, and ended up selling it to the used bookstore instead of giving it to them."
2,Disappointing,"I'm actually disappointed in this book -- didn't have any NEW deals I didn't already know about, and the day after I purchased it here, I found it somewhere else for a fraction of what I paid here. Oh well ... live and learn, I guess."
3,Helpful For New Ideas,"I like this book, but it is not as helpful and I had hoped. It is filled with many new ideas for us and I am sure that we will use it."
1,"Unbelievably Good Deals? Well, should be if over 65...",If you're over 65 this book may be of minor interest. That's what the title should be IF YOU'RE OVER 65.Check it out of the library before buying it.
1,bad,"This tape would be ok if the instructer wasnt a complete distraction, she paid hardly any attetion to women but flocking about the men in this video. She spent no time explaining the moves and how to do them right. She is not what I expected this was the worst investment on a video workout tape I have ever bought! She loves her self a little to much!"
4,I remember it too,"I grew up with Rick(only for the year he was at the military academy) and went to Lake Havasu in 1969 to go to some of those ""cultesac parties"" he wrote about in the book.He and I planned to go to a ""concert"" back east together that we wound up not making it to, something called Woodstock.I remember him all these years later as just the guy in the book, a crazy guy who told great stories about Havasu.We pulled some good stuff at the military school too, shaving creme fights, playing ""bringing in the sheves"" instead of the prescribed marches much to the consternation of the bandmaster.Great book Rick!"
4,The man behind Science of Mind,"For students of science of mind, this book provides insight into the thinking and vision of Ernest Holmes, as shared by a friend and colleague, Reginald Armor."
1,Somethings Fishy,"This book is a waste of time. I have my B.A., my M.A. and am working on my Ph.D. in literature, and can assure you that I can read. This so called author likes to use large words to sound intelligent, but really just proves that he is a phony with his sad attempts at complex sentence structures. The prose is that of a child who grossly overuses the Microsoft word thesaurus function. I suspect that the positive reviews were also written by him, as they are in the same pretentious tone of undeserved superiority, accompanied with the ususal spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.Don't be fooled."
4,tim is electric,"I bought this cd expecting an acoustic tim reynolds like dmb and tim at luther,etc. wow was i surprised. he is electric. with a bevy of electronic loops including bass,drums and organ he is unlike anything that he has recorded thusfar. it's entirely live. the guy who reviewed the cd that said it's mostly acoustic obviosly never heard it. tim sounds like jeff beck, hendrix, or stevie ray vaughn at times. i believe that he could have varied things a bit more but it's worth more than one listen. he is quite the guitarist. 4 stars"
1,I don't know about this product.,This item came up on my account to be reviewed...couldn't get rid of it. I am a MALE and I never ordered this item and cannot vouch for it. Amazon is not very flexible about things like this but in all honesty I can not say anything about this one way or the other.
2,Brits Do It Better,"I'ts unfortunate if you've seen the original (British) version of this soap. Our cousins had cuter actors, more sex scenes, and a faster-paced script. At times in the US version I found myself looking at the clock as the melodrama dragged on. But... it's a start for more frank TV here in America. Let's see more and better follow-ups."
1,Puh Leeze! An Insult to the gay and lesbian community !,One word review CONDESCENDING!I was trying to give it ZERO star!
1,The worst show I've ever seen.,"I saw ""Particles of Truth"" with Gale Harold and thought he was good, liked the fact that he could play a gay man and was hoping the show would be ""raw and cutting-edge"" and unusual. The acting is just horrible, I only watched 5-6 episodes (since I paid Blockbuster for it), I can handle all the stuff they are showing (being a straight woman), but the show is poor and choppy. I can't believe in Editorial Review it says Sex and the City is like a tea party in comparison with this show. In my opinion, there is no comparison. Sex and the City is brilliant, hilariously funny, touching and a classic! I was hoping Queer as Folk would be something like this for gay people, but it is pretty pitiful. Sorry to say that..."
5,I Love QAF,I didnt plan on enjoying Queer As Folk as much as I thought I would. A friend showed me a few episodes 20-22 and after the first one I thought yeah right but then came the last episode and I thought YEAH RIGHT I was hooked and knew I had to get the DVD as soon as it came out.Living in Pennsylvania I find these characters are dead on accurate. What I enjoy most is the characters are there for each other in good times and bad.I think Brian is a great character-strong and outspoken.This is a Great series and I hope it doesnt end anytime soon
4,Very Good!,"I loved this series: funny, imaginative and certainly original! My only complaint is about the lack of subtitles in the DVD collection: as English is not my first language, the subtitles would have been very helpful."
4,Surprisingly Heartwarming,"My first impression of the show was that it was nothing more that soft-core porn unintentionally labeling everyone in the society it depicts. Then, the more avid of a watcher I became, I noticed the heart of the show. Jennifer's struggle to accept her son is beautiful, and Justin's unbreakable devotion to Brian is so moving that it will leave you with a feeling of utter shock. Watching the show is a truely breathtaking adventure you will want to experiance over and over again"
5,One of the best shows on tv,"I never watched Queer as Folk when it was on Showtime, but I figured I would buy Season 1 and check it out, since I started watching The L Word,and liked that alot...I loved this show, the guys are hot (even though they are gay, lol), and it has a great cast and storyline...Can't wait to buy and watch the other 3 seasons.."
3,Definitely different than what I assumed it would be,"I watched this show from the beginning and I have only one word for it - SHOCKING. As a heterosexual male watching this I must admit I found it very uncomfortable to watch some of the scenes. However, as the season went on I did learn to look past the disturbing scenes and see the innate humanity of each of the characters. In many ways they seems just as screwed up as straight people. :-) Michael's longtime unrequited love for Brian is an emotion most people can understand at a basic level.However, I (insist) that this show should not be taken as an overview of the gay community (course they do have that disclaimer at the end of each show ) just like another of my favorites the Sopranos should not be thought of as an overview of the Italian community. At the end of the day, its just television. Not a bad piece of television. Just television."
2,Despicable,"I am gay and I found this appalling. The characters are nothing but embodied testosterone containers passing themselves off as human beings. This isn't a series about gay men. It is a series about sexual addiction and decadence. ... The complete spiritual bankruptcy of the characters is absolutely stunning. The dialogue is absurd. I do not know anyone who lives like this and I do not know anyone who doesn't condemn gay men who still live like this but here they are in all their infamy: selfish, self absorbed, promiscuous, materialistic, dishonorable, drug abusing, shallow, amoral, piggishly sexual. One doesn't have to wish them an untimely, ignoble end as it is inevitable. It is more the disgrace that this is watched by young gays as some kind of primer to gay life (yes, it is). Guys, it isn't. It is a primer for how to end up in rehab, therapy, bankruptcy, and a clinic."
2,Jose,"Estoy bien insatisfecho por que la serie no me llego y el distribuidor me dijo ke me iban a renvolsar el dinero pero yo queria mi serie por mi no volveria a comprar en amazon, pero con los otros productos estoy super satisfecho gracias a los distribuidores que son buena gente por ellos 2 los del cd y el mp3 compraria mas en amazon"
3,A Good Gay Soft Porn,"Thanks for the VCR remote to skip through the boring parts of the show. I watched the whole season and I found only 15 percent of it worth watching. I gave ""Queer as Folks"" 3 stars because I was aroused when the show became really interesting. Brian looked very good and so did Justin. But I found the sex scene between Justin and Chris to be the sexiest."
1,Mass-produced w/bad disc!!,"While I have to say I love the series, I would suggest buying it from some where local, because it was mass-produced with ....[messed up] episodes on disc 2, and you may get one with a bad second disc too. Better to buy local..."
5,this show rules!,"This show is very addicting. I caught half an episode one week and was hooked afterwards. Lets face it this show is HOT! But thats not all it is, its also moving, funny, emotional and interesting. The show focuses on a group of gay men and women living in Pittsburg. Theres Brian (SO UNBELIEVEABLY HOT!), Michael, Justin, Ted, Emmet, Melanie, Lindsay, Vic and Debbie. In the pilot 29 year old hot shot Brian meets 17 year old Justin. They hook up for the night and Brian thinks nothing else of it, Justin on the otherhand has fallen head over heels in love with Brian, as it was his first time. These two were extremely interesting to watch throughout the season, as we saw them develop and grow. Brian is my absolute favourite character and even though he can be an assehole you cant help but love him. The other are interesting too and i love them all. This show is beautiful and great to watch. If you dont watch it you dont know what you're missing out on, gay or straight, it doesnt matter!"
5,Gary Palmer said it all,"Review by Lyn Carr, Denver, Colorado. USALoved the Queer as Folks DVD set, and the hours of extra goodies on number six. What more is there to say about this series, slick or not. It's great and so are the DVD's, especially the inclusion of what the music is and who did it on each disc.Gary Palmer, a reviewer, said, ""This episode,(first season finale) more than any other, amounts to a near-perfect combination of music, character development and dramatic action, and is without question the most heartbreaking hour of television this reviewer has ever seen."" Ditto, my man, ditto.What leads up to it is a must seeThis set is a keeper!!!"
3,"Great series, shame about the DVD","When a friend lent me a VHS copy of the series, I told myself, I have to buy the DVD box set. When I got it, I was all excited to see the season one in its entirety but I was disappointed with the set. Episode 1 special edition slowed down from the start; I barely saw it. That same episode minus the commentary also skipped in places. Each disk thereafter has episodes that have parts that skip. Worse, my disk 3 is defective; my player couldnt read it. Is this a common problem?"
5,Queer as Folk (Showtime version),"QAF is an extremely well written series, presenting a cross section of urban American gay stereotypes. The characters are well developed, with exceptional depth. A leading character (who you are at first likely to despise) exhibits very subtle hints of a person with far more depth, early in the series. Watch for it - it's there in what he *doesn't* say. In a perfect world, this series would win top honors for cinematography: bedroom scenes, in particular, are stunningly beautiful. Nothing of the urban gay nightlife is left untouched, yet it is touched gracefully and with remarkable sensitivity. This adaptation (US) teaches several clear paths to self-respect as a gay person living in the USA."
5,Being Real,"This show is the best on television. I am not gay, but it really addresses a very wide range of social issues, while not being preachy at all. The dialogue thorughout the entire first season was incredible and consistent with the words I hear on an every day basis (odd that a typical day receives an NC-17 rating) Sure there are some graphic scenes in this show, but they are actually central to it. This beautiful piece of art is a must have that I reccomend to everyone, even homophobes."
5,The greatest television drama series ever made...,"Speaking as a Brit, I thought our version of QAF was good, but I think the American series is even better than ours.I award this series full marks for writing, acting, direction. And the sex scenes are far more daring than I'd ever imagined they would be, without being too gratuitous. Perhaps the producers of ""Queer as Folk USA"" (as we call it) could come over to Britain and show our TV producers how to make a decent show. Most of our TV dramas stink!This DVD set is a must have. I've watched the whole of the first series twice now, and I love it!Long live QAF USA!"
4,addictive heartfelt TV,"This show dives into issues relevant to gays, straights, bi's around the world: tolerance, identity, truth, friendship. I applaude the actors, directors, writers, and producers for their courage. I hope that they keep on pushing the envelope.I've seen both the American and British versions of QAF. Both are excellent, but the British slangs and accents make the British series harder to follow.Speaking as a straight woman, the American QAF ensemble is much more attractive than the British ensemble. The Brian Kinney/Stuart Jones character becomes more believable when played by the magnetic, gorgeous Gale Harold.Vote with your dollars and buy, rent both US and UK QAF. Show all those scared corporate drones that daring, intelligent TV has an audience!"
5,One of the BEST series ever created!!,"I found this show while channel surfing, just a few months ago on a censored station. I had heard of this show before, but did not have premium cable, so I was unable to watch when it hit the screen originally. I absolutely fell in love with it with just one episode, I would tape and watch faithfully. I was determined to get the DVD version, so that I could see it uncut and in it's original form. The first season is very near and dear to my heart, probably the best of the series!! The show was casted perfectly, you will fall in love with each and every character. Yes, it contains a lot of sex, drugs, and language, but it's also full of loving relationships, fun, humor,intelligence, brilliance, and warmth that will make it very difficult to tear yourself away from it. I'm a 40yo straight woman who would love to be a part of these queer as folk!"
5,GROUNDBREAKING!,"Since the price of the dvd set of Queer As Folk's first season has been lowered, I felt I should write a review.Straight and gay people alike have watched this show. This was the first of its kind, and although the show tended to get better in later seasons, it's still nonetheless great to watch! Sharon Gless is a joy to watch, and is one of the main reasons I stuck with this show from beginning to end! The entire cast are great actors, and just because most of the characters happen to be gay, it does not mean a person viewing this remarkable show has to be gay!The beginning of the series starts with a high school student who comes to terms with his sexuality (very easily) and ends up meeting a group of friends-all of which have their own quirks, problems, and comedic moments. This show really is something to witness. Showtime did an excellent thing by putting this on the air"
5,Straight Girls Love It Too!,"I have loved this series since it first came out. I haven't missed ONE episode and bought the set for my mother to watch. I'm a straight married woman, which from what I have seen, is a very up and coming QAF fan group!These folk are so real and funny! I find myself laughing out loud every few minutes during the shows. My ""used-to-be"" against gays hubby even has started watching this show with me and although he doesn't agree with everything he sees, he is beginning to accept gay lifestyles as a real love. Real men, real women who have the same kind of problems that straight people do. Along with a few others.I think this show does open some closed minds and if others would just give it a chance, they would absolutely LOVE it like I do. With three kids and one on the way, working full time and trying to keep a house, this show gives me that boost of laughter and emotional connection that I need each week. I can't wait until next season!"
5,Great Show,I really enjoyed this show! I had to buy it for a class but now I'm hooked. The characters are so appealing! I will have to get the rest of the seasons.
4,Good tv series,"The first season of Queer as folk ( american series) works fine, except for some plots diferent to the original british version, don't well written ( Emmet's Conversion, for example).Besides, the series is terrific: good performings and many extras in the DVD colecction. Is avalaible in spanish mono languaje, too, but the voices of the actors in the translation are ridiculuos and ""sassy"". I give 4 stars."
3,"A Flawed Release, but...A Good Series","As mentioned in other reviews the second disk of the DVD set I purchased is flawed. Here I am ready to watch Justin do a classmate, and episode 4 and 5 on the second disk will not play. I thought it may be just my set, but now I see that others have purchased sets with the same problem."
5,I feel compelled,"I feel compelled to put in my two or three cent review before reading what others have said. I purchased the DVD set months before watching a single episode. It sat gathering dust because I was expecting a perhaps lust-ier regurgitation of all that we've seen about gay people's lives...sadness, pain, rejection, humiliation offset by a laughing caricature-like character or few who would say, ""Its all OK.""What I started out with, as I sat down to go through my children's out-grown clothing, was a view of the lives of people who were gay AND human beings with real lives and...um stuff. What I ended up with was a closet of messy children's clothing because I was compelled to watch undistracted. I immediately purchased the rest of the seasons and was a gruesome addict to the end.I've seen the Lesbiyawn series The Lword. When will they get a show as powerful and clever as QAF? I can say that because I've dated a few..."
4,Good,"Dvds were in good shape. The box was kind of messed up, but not too bad. Took a little while to receive."
5,Queer As Folk-Season 1,"I luv this show sooo much-I haven't watched it in years and finally decided to order it-My package arrived in like 2 days and was properly packed,great purchase:)"
3,It will be nice if it is available with subtitles for the hearing impaired,Or for people who speak another language and desire to hear the original voices. Is not that true that it is exactly the way it should legally be?
5,I recommend this product to share with friends on sunday afternoon,"hi everybody, I recommend this product, cause the serie show the gay life in America, Already several years have passed,Queer as Folk - The Complete First Seasonthe gay culture have not changed about the manners, social behavoir,uses and customs. It's good cause there are many options, if you see the tv serie in english with subtitles or dub into spanish.The dubbing into spanish is good cause the voices are simmilars to latinos.In the box set there are material extra about the characters."
4,"Lifestyle aside, you get caught up in the lives.","In spite of the fact that I'm gay, some parts of this series makes me uncomfortable. Nonetheless, I got caught up in the trials and tribulations of the characters. I'm not able to watch Queer As Folk when it airs so I am glad I can purchase it to view, and review in my home. I think my money was well spent, and I am going to purchase season two."
4,Queer as folk,"I really enjoyed watching the first season again, such a great series its a shame that it ended. I've since gone on and purchased the next few seasons."
3,Looks amazing; feels too rough; too pricey for the low quality fabric,"The sheets look really nice. However, they feel a bit too rough for a child. I ended up washing them a couple of times with softener which of course blurred the picture.My daughter still loves it. I would have given it 2 stars otherwise"
3,"Not the best, not essential",Much of the improvising is rather dull and predictable sounding. Also there's an extremely annoying electronic buzz all the way through. Nevertheless it's a keeper for me as I love Rollins' sound and playing style - only play it about once every 5 years due to the above limitations.
3,Part 1 & 2,"This would be a great album for the fusion lovers, but I don't really like it. I don't know where he was going with this"
1,Really Bad Scanner,"I have one of these scanners and thank goodness I didn't pay for it. I wouldn't give you a dime for a truck load of them. All of the software will not load and then the scanner locks up and looses it's self. When this happenes, you have to close all software, unplug the power cable and then tell it to find/refresh it's self. I have had to try to scan one page 6 times to get it to scan. I will be getting a HP asap and even sooner if possible. I hate this scanner...do not buy one!!"
1,Terrible with Win2000/XP,"1- Doesn't work with Win2000/XP2- Umax tells you to BUY (!) their driver for Win2000/XP (not downloadable)3- Even with the appropriate driver, the Umax 2200 still doesn't work.... Very frustrating. Terrible support/brand. Do not touch UMAX with a 10 foot poll!"
3,"Not stellar, but does the job, and DOES work w/ Win XP","Bought it at a rummage sale for $15. Another $15 for the CD from Umax w/ the Windows XP drivers. Once the CD arrived, I installed everything and had it up and running (with only minor hiccups) on my Win XP Pro system in about a half-hour. Not the best scanner, but quite acceptable for what I need now, and quite a deal at a total of $30."
2,Very annoying machine,Used to work ok in win 98 but when I upgraded to XP it's nearly useless (considering how expensive it is!)It only works if you unplug the transparency cover and UMAX won't upgrade the drivers for XP. I bought it for slides and it wasn;t even great at those - bad colour reproduction. I have to fix almost every image with photophop.I advsise against this and will not be buying any more umax products.
1,A Parental Refresher,"If you are in your 20's and never had much parenting, you may find this book worthwhile. On the other hand, if you have had some socialization and/or you've read any self-help books, chances are good this is a repeat, at best. It's true there's a lot there, it covers most of life's skills. But it is boring, written in a parental ""do it this way"" voice with advice about not talking with food in your mouth, your elbows on the table, being rude, inconsiderate, etc. There's a page after each chapter with ""Mistakes to Avoid"" and the expected consequences, in detail. I found the short quotes that begin each chapter the best part, but after that, it was downhill . . . ."
3,Better than a ZipLock,"I purchased this case thinking that it was like my last one with a clear plastic cover across the keys and display. I work in construction and this helps keep the dirt out. This case did not. It also relys on a plastic base that clips onto the phone. I have had problems with the part on the face side comming off. That being said, it is better than a ziplock so I will continue to use it."
5,Great phone leather phone cover for the V3,"This is made by Naztech and it fits my V3 perfectly.The case they sold at the Cingular store seemed a little long (on the ear piece) and slid on my phone. The plastic piece that fit near the phone hinge where it flips broke off and I had to get a replacement. I did not want the same case because it did not last long (22 days, cingular store would not replace it), looked like cheap plastic and cost more than this case.This case looks nice and protects my phone better because the fit is better and it has a swivel clip that seems just as nice as the previous case that swivel clip fits too so I have a backup. It is well made and nicely priced."
3,"""Kidnapped"" - WOW! , ""Catriona"" - Meh....","Kidnapped is one of my favorite books. Perhaps that's why Catriona didn't do much for me. To me, it read as the typical sequel to a great story. It just doesn't have the punch and thrills of Kidnapped. The prose of course is excellent, though there is far more scottish lingo than the 1st book. This makes it a bit of a struggle to get through. I don't think I'd recommend it, especially after reading Kidnapped, unless someone has a real passion for Scottish literature."
1,Smear Tactics,I personally know most of the people who were involved in the Republican Heritage Groups Council that helped to elect Reagan and none of them were Nazi's.Some of them were teenagers when they came to the United States and were not involved in any way with Nazi's in their countries of origin except to try and not be killed by them.The horrible desecration that communism visited on the Eastern European countries these people were from led to a life long and well justified hatred of communism. And their embrace of American freedom and their fight against communism certainly doesn't make them Nazi's or Nazi sympathizers.
4,ELIZABETH AND JESSICA RUN AWAY,I think Jessica and Elizabeth can not permit Eric and Wesley Nelson's practical joke. But I think thier joke is sweet joke. Then they become good friends. I think good.
3,ok book for kiddys,"As a big Sweet Valley fan I have read the odd jr series,especially as my neices own them.This is a story about the twins""running away"" only they are found in,like,an hour and have not left home...These books are often anti-climax,but I think that is ok.The author is attempting realism,and to be real to the way kids really behave."
4,sexy,it kept my interest . I like janet chapmans writing style. i like her highland series. they are intertwined okay
2,Not very good....,"A time-travel story with magic sounds great but this book was juvenile. It took little imagination to write that a person is/was a bird or whatever. It was just dumb. The author should take a lesson from Diana Gabaldon, the master of time-travel novels.And Ms. Chapman cannot seem to make her heros very cool with words or actions, with the possible exception of Michael. In this the author should take a lesson from Tara Janzen, the master of the cool hero, and heroine for that matter."
2,Way Too Supernatural,"I did not like this book at all. It was way too bizarre. I enjoyed ""Charming The Highlander"" very much. This book was awful, however.There is so much mystical magic going on with all the characters, the story gets lost. The worrying and dismay over the dying tree was kind of pathetic.I don't recommend this one at all."
1,I hate wimpy women,"This book made me so mad. i can't buy that the heroine was so swept away by passion that she let the ""hero"" treat her this way. This is the person whose hands the fate of the world rest in. Boy are we in trouble. I got about halfway through the book and then ended up throwing it across the room. don't waste your time."
4,enjoy reading,"Same as last book, enjoyable hard to put down wanted to finish in one sitting but not enough time."
2,Weak plot,"This story was such a let down. It seemed from the first book of the series,Charming the Highlander (Highlander Trilogy), the existence of Winter MacKeage was built up so much that when I finished reading this book,I was left a bit dumbfounded. It's been mentioed time and again in the previous books about how powerful a druid she will become and even Matt/Curam for that matter, yet there was a lack of evidence of this supposed mighty power. Curam did not even strike me as a powerful druid to beware of, as the impression I got from Robbie MacBain and Father Daar. In fact, Talking Tom seems to be the one that resolved the supposed big catastrophe waiting to happen. I also did not really feel any chemistry between Winter and Matt/Curam. The storyline for Talking Tom was a bit more mysterious and should have been what this book was about."
5,Important Work Translated with bias,The translators of this important Work do almost everything in their power to demythologize and empiricist this works mystical and visionary thrust with Aristotelian bias. Still because we have Corbin's commentary we can read against this bias and not let the academics bamboozle us.
3,Inventing Being,"In Inventing Being Ferenc Mózsi compiles 56 highly personal poems that are surprisingly mostly about the poets experience as just that, a poet. Titles include, ""Poetically Just,"" ""Disheveled Poems,"" ""Unwieldy Poem,"" and many others in which poetry is the subject. Through the beauty of the words he uses he shares with the reader an experience that for him is almost holy - writing. Of course, the collection is not just about poetry, for that would be strange to say the least. Like any writer Mózsi, whether intentionally or not, transplants his life unto the page. There it mixes with the fundamentals of a poem, and the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. Mózsi shows that as a poet he cannot separate his life from the poetry, nor the poetry from his life. On some pages dreamlike images are included, as though to aid the reader in feeling what Mózsi must have felt."
2,Inventing Being,"I am not a poetry lover and this book did nothing to convince me otherwise. For 200 pages (100 actually- half the book is the original poems in Hungarian, the other half translated to English) the poet rambles on and on about his search (and struggle) for love through muddled images of flowers and starry nights. I think the poet's goal behind this descriptive style is to pull the readers into a dream like world to better illustrate his confusion, but instead it just becomes annoying. I couldn't even finish it."
4,Inventing Being,"The poems written by Ferenc Mozsi and translated by Peter Hargitai are both playful and cerebral. Mozsi uses countless plays on words, making the reader take a deeper look past the surface and into the emotional root of the words which create the poems. His work is mysterious and passionate, connecting things like roses in the desert to the feelings he cannot describe because they are too complex for words. Although this book may be too much for the casual reader, lovers of poetry may feel a deep connection with the feelings touched upon by Mozsi."
3,"Francois Jr Alexandre (O'cayes, Haiti)","Ferenc Mozsi INVENTING BEING translated by Peter Hargitai is a book of poems that are about love. Through out every poem in the Inventing Being, I get a variety of feelings. The efforts of his writings are shown in every line, from beginning to end. Not only will you feel love, but you'll be introduced to passion. If you were to put these words into your everyday life you would be reborn in the name of poetry."
5,nice!,"(In) Venting BeingThis is one of the greatest modern poetry books out there. His poems are not cliché love poems but instead poems of a tortured man in love. His poems are very real to what love truly is, with out falling into stereotypes. He also has a very original way to play on words by adding parenthesis at the beginning of words. Very real. Very easy to relate to. I would recommend this to anyone!"
3,Inventing Being,"Ferenc Mozsi INVENTING BEING translated by Peter Hargitai is a book of poems that are about love. The poems are written in such an abstract art form that needs you to think out of the box to get a full meaning of what he is trying to say in the poem. Mozsi uses his poems to vent out all of his inner emotions that have been contained in him for so long. The poems give vivid images of passion and love. The book not only touches the heart, but the mind and body."
4,Inventing Being,"This book of poems was great to read because it put so many thoughts into your head as you read a long. So many different ideas coming from the same person, the creativity of this man is incredible. While reading this you open your mind to new meanings and thoughts that you had never understood before. I personally think that this book would be appreciated by anyone who takes the time to read it."
5,Inventing Being,"The book Inventing Being written by Ferenc Moasi and later translated to English by Peter Hargitai is an exciting poetic adventure. The poems relating to how he is able to find himself and be comfortable with who he really is gives the reader a new meaning of life. It lets us know that is ok not to be perfect and to be happy with ourselves as we are. I truly recommend this book to any person who is trying to define themselves, it will help to hear from other's experience."
3,SAC and B-52s,"This is a hokey film that has little relationship with real SAC/B-52 operations in the late 1950s. However, it is certainly worthwhile as a means of viewing some flying shots of the (early) B-52 aircraft. Most of the ""on-base"" flight sequences were taken during the film-crew's visit to Castle AFB (at the time, near Atwater, California; the base was closed some years ago). As a young Lt. fresh out of USAF flying school, and assigned to the 328th Bomb Sqdn. at Castle, I was lucky enough to see some of the filming, and observe some of the 'stars' walking around the base. It was amusing to see Mr. Zimbalist walking around in his colonel's uniform, and being saluted by all lower ranks who passed him; I'm sure he got a chuckle out of it. Definitely worth a look!!"
4,Duty or Money,"This is a interesting movie, about a career USAF Sgt, who is a Crew Chief on large bombers such as the B47 or B52. It show's how miltary personnel are sometimes tempted to move into the private sector by money and a more stable life and the miltary's struggle to hold on to talented and trained personnel. This is still relevant in the miltary today."
2,Poor story line!!!,Poor story. Military didn't allow officers to date NCO's family. Lower ranked personel worked on aircraft while most NCO's supervised!
3,bombers b-52,I bought this item for its technical aspects.Specifically the action in the B-52 getting the landing gear down. The story line was OK but not of any factor in whether I bought the item or not.
1,Shoddy Workmanship,"This very pretty bracelet fell to pieces the first time I put it on; the wire used appears to be too fine for the weight of the stones. Ultimately I'm left feeling this is an expensive piece of cheap junk jewelry--enough to make me think twice about ever buying jewelry over the Internet again. And, a month later, I'm still waiting on a refund..."
5,Very unique,"This bag was a gift from my boyfriend and it's gorgeous. It has a good quality, it's different and the materials are very durable. I'd say this is a very nice addition to anyone's bag collection. Although I must agree with the previous reviews saying that the bag is a bit heavy, but besides that, it's a beautiful bag."
1,Couldn't wait to finish it,"Yes, I admit it, I was fooled by the bright pink color. And the sad thing is I don't even like pink. I thought this was going to be a laugh out loud sort of book but little did I know that the only laughing I was going to be doing was out of sheer exasperation. The only way I finished it was purely because I can get neurotic about unfinished books. Strikes at times, whilst some times I have no problem chucking an unfinished book at walls.MAYBE my expectations were out of proportion. After all it's a self-help/ anecdotal sort of book. Then again, most of these tips seemed like common sense. And the writing was pretty mediocre.Not going to buy a pink book again."
3,Quick Read,"I bought this book after reading from[...]that it was an awesome book. It has small anecdotes about every day married life written by the wife. It kept me entertained for awhile but by the middle I was already skimming through it. It had some good points but after I was done, I quickly donated it to the local library."
2,Ho Hum .... Humorless,"I specifically got this book because I thought it was a book of humor and it received good reviews from other readers. I personally have been married for six (6) years so I really thought this book would be completely hiliarious. Sadly, I was wrong. Honestly the wife comes off as nothing more than a boring doormat. This is suppose to be a book about all the fights that all married couple has during the first yearof marriage but reads more like how to keep your true feelings bottled up and not cause unneeded conflict while trying to keep your arguments constructive. In a word - A poorly written Self Help Book. It would have been a saving grace had it been funny and/or helpful."
1,Twice the price,"I will readily pay a premium for convenience, but this item is priced at more than twice the cost at a local grocery store. I am shocked. While a great product, it is not worth the premium price here."
1,Bootleg - no original dvds,"Don't buy this dvd, because this is not an original version. The only legal way to buy the Ranma 1/2 is buy the viz, the other foreign editions or buy the japanese version.Bootlegging company is fx."
3,"Bootleg yes, but its the best bootleg.","All I am going to say is that the bootleg company pictured here is one of the best. Fx always makes some good rips with decent packaging. Really though, it can't be too hard to get the whole set legitimately for just a little more money. ...Nevermind, it would cost you about $210 for the complete DVD set if you bought them by season box sets."
1,How do these get into Amazon?,"Bootleg item. Doesn't benefit the creators of the anime, and the official N.A. distributors (yea, the people who bring anime from Japan into U.S. Legally).The quality will Not be DVD-worthy as these will be ripped off of Viz English-dubbed VHS videos. Save your money and buy something else!"
5,Refuting the ideas of the contemporary world,"This Catholic Church document, Persona Humana, was released in 1975 to help refute the growing confusion and relaxation of morals in the world. In particular, this document firmly restates the church's teaching on sexuality.A few topics are explicitly mentioned, including pre-marital sex, homosexuality, and masturbation. The ""fundamental option,"" which says mortal sin is rare and only occurs when someone totally commits to turn away from God, is also refuted.The document is short and can be read in about an hour. It's a good and orthodox choice for those who want to know more about the Church's teaching on sexual ethics."
2,Win98 drivers it comes with are no good,"If not for the comment left by Keith Peterson from Bridgeport, CT USA I would not have been able to get this working. I spent hours frustrated because the Win98 drivers that came in the box would not install. There online chat tech support left me waiting for upwards of 45 minutes before I gave up on them. I had to install the Realtek drivers to get it to work."
1,Warranty Warning!!,"Belkin warranty [is not good]! They will only honor a warranty IF you purchased the product from one of their authorized resellers. Purchases from what Belkin terms as 3ed party resellers, are not eligible for their warranty. I purchased their product, new in the factory box, but it was from a source that was not on their list. I actually bought 2 cards but one was DOA. After a couple of emails back and forth with Belkin, my only recourse was to chalk it up as a lesson learned and I will never buy a Belkin product again because I can never be sure if the seller is on their current list of authorized resellers!!!!!!!"
4,"Great card, little trouble setting up","I installed the card on an older Gateway machine with Win98 installed. The card was recognized in the Device Manager but not seen in the Network area. After some surfing I discovered the chipset it uses, Realtek 8139A, downloaded that driver and after installing, everything was recognized and now my network is humming along with no problems. I would have given the card 5 stars if it wasn't for the small driver issue."
3,It works great in my Windows XP computer.,"A good cheap way to set up a network, if it is just to share an internet connection, to simply connect two computers.<The card comes with a cable that the instruction manual call a WOL, it says to plug it up to a WOL port on the motherboard behind a PCI slot? It works fine if you don't, I don't know what a WOL Port is, I have opeaned many computers ane never seen a port as described by this manual"
5,Saved my computer use with new service,"The individual who installed stated piece of cake, I do not work on computers so why ease of installation is stated for someone who would mess up the computer, he had to download some software he had to make it connect but process tool about an hout and now Ihave a computer hooked to my DSL!"
4,Nice table,"I bought this directly from a Target store after seeing it in a circular. It took about 15 minutes to put together, very easy. Solid construction, smooth, slightly sheen black finish. Was slightly smaller than I thought after placed in my living room, but overall happy with it."
1,Almost The Worst?,"There are undoubtedly worse movies -- but this one is certainly pathetic. A ho-hum plot that, had the actors known how to act, might have been saved, but not one of them, save occasionally Bud Spenser, ever utters a line without it seeming to be read directly from the script in a senior class play. The color is awful, the babes are cheap and phony, fight scenes are a farce, and despite torrents of bullets no one ever gets hit, to say nothing of killed. It is sort of a comedy, and sort of an action movie, but mostly it is just a waste. Imagine, people actually collect Spenser and Hill movies!! What was it H.L. Mencken is supposed to have said, ""No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.""?"
1,Expensive baking pan,"Not sure how other people have been able to make a real loaf of bread with this, but I certainly could not. I made three attempts, all failures for various reasons. Either it did not mix, or the dough was so hard it knocked the pan off its base, or it created pebbles of dough. It definitely can not be left unattended, which defeats the purpose of delay start. It bakes OK though, but you better do all the upfront work yourself. PS. I was using the recipes that come with the maker."
4,There is nothing like the smell of fresh bread to wake up to in the morning.,I really enjoy this machine as it seems to work well with all of the different recipes I have tried so-far. I really enjoy the fact that it has so many programing options for different varities of bread and dough. It is also a very attractive appliance that will complement any kitchen. My only complaint is that sometimes there will be a small amount of dough that doesn't mix well in the corners of the baking tub.
2,Good bread while it worked,"We used this breadmaker lightly (once every 2-3 weeks) for about a year. When it worked, it made good bread. After it stopped working, for no apparent reason, it will simply not knead the bread. The machine powers up, the timer starts, but the timer never decrements, and the machine does nothing. We have all the parts. The manual says that this can happen if the kneading paddle is not installed, but ours is most definitely there.I'm not the only person with this problem, either. It seems fairly common with this model. No amount of fiddling or playing with options can get it to do anything."
4,Great Machine,"This is my first bread machine and so far I am not dissapointed! I made the best pumpernickel bread ever following the simple directions. It is beautiful in stainless steel and is not an eye sore on the counter.the drawbacks-I find this machine a bit noisy and the so called ""see through"" window is really not see through. The ""cradle for the baking pan can be a little troublesome. Once a timer has been started it cannot be changed, for instance, you'd have to clear it and start over. It does however, let you know when each cycle has been completed.Other that that, it lets you know when to add ingredients and when its over. It has an hour extended warmer so your bread stays warm. You can delay the timer for those nights when you pull yourself together and mix the ingredients for fresh bread in the morning.I still can't believe that I can put the ingredients in and walk away and comeback to yummy hot bread."
2,Breadman 900S,I have owned this breadman for one year. I make between one and two loafs of bread per week. Mostly whole wheat bread. I purchased the 900S because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well (8 years).Pros:It makes a good loaf of bread.Good selection of cycles.Loaf is easy to extract from the pan.Cons:The motor is not very powerful. It lugs down when making whole wheat bread.After 7 months of operation the Teflon wore off the mixing paddle.At 11 months the bearing failed in the mixing pan.Overall I am disappointed in this bread machine and I could not recommend it.
5,Great bread - great machine,"I received this bread machine and within the first week have made three loaves of bread. The first one was from a package and I believe the yeast was old, because it did not rise properly. The second and third loaves were from scratch (from cookbook included with machine,) and to my surprise the bread was the best I have ever baked. I previously owned a Panasonic bread machine, which was a plain machine without all the selections this machine has. We love it!!! and the low cost to make the bread is the best! I make a loaf on Sunday afternoons, so the house smells wonderful before our Christian friends come over for Bible Study."
4,Great Bread Maker!,"Very good product! The manual is easy to understand and has countless recipies for every kind of bread, dinner roll, pizza dough and what ever else might interest you. It has all the dough courses listed right on the lid so all you have to do is follow the recipe in the manual, enter the course number, select the size of the loaf and darkness, turn it on and forget about it. It's so easy that anyone can do it! The breads and pizza doughs have all been delicious. (I haven't tried any of the jam courses.) My only complaint is that there should be some sort of removable crumb tray under the cooking compartment for easy cleaning. Highly recommended product."
5,Love this machine!,"Got this breadmaker for christmas. I've never used one before this, I was trying to teach myself to make bread by hand with only occasional success. This machine takes all the guess work out of the process. I have made bread at least 2x per week since we got it and have had no problems what-so-ever. Bread comes out perfect every time.It has many features, but until now, I have only used it to make bread.I highly recommend it"
5,Goldmine's Country Western...,"It has provided hours and hours of answers. We have started a small collectors ""business"" and it helps us to establish our parameters."
4,I basically love anything by this author,"Randisi has done it again.He has managed to write a police thriller that will keep you on your toes and make you feel as though the book should never end.Although I thought that I had figured out the ending, it turns out that there are a few twists and turns in this one that I hadn't counted on.Buy this book and enjoy an honest to goodness thriller. I have been really missing those lately."
4,Thank you Liming.,"A generous sharing of the experiences of a very courageous woman. Brings a personal view, from the countryside, of the effect of Mao's ""madness"" on China's society. Liming gives us all this without losing control of her emotions. She is a survivor and an inspiration to all women. A good companion to Nien Cheng's _""Life and Death in Shanghai""."
5,Flying High out of a Tibetan Valley,"Many people in the US take democracy for granted. They never give a thought about it. Or they think democrary is nothing important. However, they can freely criticize the US government without any fear. They don't realize that they have been enjoying democracy.Liming knows how important democracy is. As she was growing up during the Cultural Revolution in China, even a joke might put you in jail. Chinese people at that time had no freedom of speech. If you criticized the government, you would be killed or get a life sentence.China has changed a lot since Mao died. But still, people in China today do not have the freedom of speech that Americans have.Flying High out of a Tibetan Valley is a great book. After you read it, you will realize the true meanings of freedom and democracy."
4,pleasantly surprised!,"I've always felt insecure about my bikini line, but after I used this Nair product I'm not nearly as insecure as I was before. I have yet to use it on my legs, but have tried it on my bikini line and found it to be a success. At first I tried a small area and waited about 9 minutes and tested it out. It worked, which surprised me because the last time I used Nair (about 5 years ago) I thought my skin was going to burn off. Sure, the smell's not great, but it has improved since it first came out. Give it a try!"
5,One Love To Syko,This piece is hotta than fish grease. Syko is a long time friend of mine and I'm glad to see that he is finally getting some recognition for his talent. Anyone who wants a copy of any of his last 5 albums hit me up at [...]. I'd be more than happy to help promote Syko and hook you up at the same time. One Love Syko.Mr.Bandit Locc
1,"Another ""Mastering..."" masterpeice","Do you see the word ""Mastering..."" in the title? That means, as always, leave this one on the shelf. I've never met a ""Mastering..."" book that was worth a dime."
2,Terrible static in both our cars,"Yeah, it's cheap, but it doesn't work well in either of our cars regardless of the locale we're in. I get loads of static on any of the channels I use. I sent back my first unit thinking it was a problem with the unit, but the replacement is just as bad.I'll look for a different solution, perhaps one of the adapter systems which directly connects an iPod to the existing stereo in cars, or perhaps a replacement of the tuner unit with one supporting iPods and satellite radios.Too bad this doesn't work better for us. It would have been a great solution."
1,"Works great - 4 stars, not 1","Works as advertised. At first I thought there were issues with it's transmitter as the signal was very quiet, but I found that you need to use both volume controls (on the iPod and the stereo you're transmitting to). Crank up the volume on the iPod and then use the volume level on your receiver. Has a good range too, I'm able to sit away from my vehicle, iPod in hand, and listen to it on the car's radio."
1,Not Too Good,"I bought this on saturday and returned it the same day! the signal was poor at best, i could constantly hear the static in the back ground and the sound was heavily degraded. not even close to cd quality or just directly pluging the ipod in. save your money."
2,Pretty but ineffective...,"I bought this thing because it looked well thought out and I had heard good things about it. The truth is, it can't hold a signal in a car. In addition, if you live in a market like New York where every other spot on the dial has an FM station on it, you're not going to get the space the manufacturer recommends. You're far better off getting a cassette adapter if your car can use one. The only place my iTrip gets used anymore is in the house, where I use it to play my iPod out of radios in whichever room I'm in.One other thing... if you just press play on your iPod, rather than a specific playlist, and you're in shuffle mode, eventually your iTrip settings, which are stored on the iPod itself as 5 second tracks, will get ""played"". This leads to your iPod changing the station you're transmitting on-- and loss of signal on your current station."
4,Coolest add on ever,"I don't get the bad reviews this little gem is getting. My iTrips work just fine. I'll admit that it's a little troublesome to have to shift frequencies when travelling but it's a small price to pay for a wireless conection to your car radio. 97.7 & 98.3 work for me in almost all locations. I find that stations between 93.1 & 98.9 work best for the strongest stereo signal.It work in my friends rides as well unless the radio is piss poor then we have some trouble dialing it in. Usually shortening the antenna solves the problem.I have both the old & new models and some of my favorite past times are,Going into a stereo store, tuning all the receivers to my iTrip station and proceed to rock the aisle...Finding a place of business that has a radio on and taking over the broadcast...Pulling up next to some punks in a hot car and blast them with my music through their own radio...I love the technology in this day and age!"
1,"A good idea, but with major flaws","My mother and I both bought brand new iTrips, and within two months, both were broken (mine broke within weeks). The iTrips have no warranty and break very easily. Sound quality is decent at best; expect random interference, and the weak signal crumbles at higher volume. If you are considering an FM transmitter for your car, casette decks are much less expensive and have far better sound quality than even the best FM transmitters . I strongly suggest you give this particular transmitter a miss."
3,"Great Product, but not perfect","Sound quality with the iTrip FM Transmitter is real good if your in a more rural area. If your in a metropolitan area of a major city like me, it is sometimes hard to find a full static station to connect. Besides that I love the fact that I can have thousands of songs to play in my vehicle."
2,"Not for audiophiles, then again, not for anyone.","First off, I'll admit it, I'm a bit anal when it comes to my music. However, all I wanted was radio-quality sound with the iTrip. What did I get? I got a good amount of buzzing, humming, and electronic interference. I have been able to find ""empty frequencies"" however, humming and a loud annoying bass boom negate any good things about the iTrip. It zaps energy from your iPod like none other, too. Sure it looks sleek and nice, but this device is all show and no go. I'm off to put in the extra cash to get a nice Monstar iCarPlay transmitter and expect great things in comparison to such a dissappointing product."
1,"It doesn't work on all iPods, as advertised",This iTrip didn't match the connectors in our 30Gb iPod.
3,Good For Taking Your i-Pod on the Road,"The good: Just plug it in and you can take your ipod anywhere there is an FM radio and get your music. Best option for this that I have found outside of a docking station that costs a lot more and doesnt help you in the car.The bad: Regardless of what they say, battery life is impacted, music quality is not quite as good and my first one lasted only 6 months with only a few hours of use. After searching for other options that could possibly be better, I picked up another one!!"
3,It works but could be better,"I have had this device for about one year now and i have been using it with my 4th generation 20gb iPod. The best features are that it integrates neatly into the top of my iPod and that i don't have to buy batteries for it (it uses the iPods battery). Griffin claim that it doesn't decrease the battery charge of the iPod but i can honestly say that i can get about 3 hours of non stop play on a full charge. Without the iTrip i can get 6 hours of play. Im going to buy an iPod car charger when the price comes down.The sound quality is not that great, its basically just like listening to the ordinary radio stations. I think the most difficult part of using this device, is trying to find a radio frequency that isnt used by a major radio station (it sounds easy but it takes a while even if you live in a rural area). Just like everyone else says here, i find the tuning procedure really clunky.At least im happy i can play my music in the car without earphones."
4,Cool lil ipod accessory,This thing works pretty well. The only time I've had a problem with it is when I have a crappy antenna on my radio. Thanks to amazon.com I got it for almost half the price anywhere else. It is totally worth it!
4,it's allright,"It's not as good as I hoped it to be, but it's better than not having one. I'd rather have one over those casette players cause those are too much of a hassle, even though these aren't as clear."
1,A good idea that doesnt work,"I tried using this device for my beloved IPOD. It wasnt nearly powerful enough to get a decent sound. Mostly all I got was static and a small tune in the background. Its a shame, because I would love to take my ipod with me in the car on long trips for everyone's enjoyment. Im extremely disappointed."
3,Installation is not difficult on PCs,"The one review scared me after I purchased mine that I was going to have to deal with musicmatch, but this is not the case at all.Go to this link for instructions on easy windows installation; ......"
1,HORRIBLE,"If you're thinking of buying this,think a hundres times. You're gonna waste your money on this JUNK. All you get is static, the audio quality is hoorible, and you better-off listening to a radio station.GRIFFIN SHOULD BE RECALLING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO.PIECE OF JUNK."
1,waiste of money,"I got the itrip 3 weeks ago and still dont now how to use it,the cd that comes with it dosent explain how to use it."
2,"Worked good, but not for long.","I bought this for my 60 gig ipod. It worked for about a month, then stopped working for some reason. Also my friend got one for her mini ipod, and it did the same thing. It works really good, then all of a sudden it doesn't work. I would buy this if it always worked, but it doesn't. Beware, don't buy!"
1,Low quality sound and too much noise disturbance,I tried the iTrip with different frequencies the result was consistant - Low quality sound and too much noise disturbance.I am returning the product.
1,Almost unusable,"On the plus side, it is very compact and fits great on the iPod. It looks like it is part of the iPod. It's a great idea.On the minus side:1. Finding gaps on the radio dial can be very difficult, especially if you commute a ways and pass through multiple radio markets.2. The iTrip just doesn't put out a very strong signal, which means that your iPod will always sound like a radio station that is fading out. You'll get no stereo separation and lots of static.3. The way you tune the iTrip to a radio station requires that you play the ""song"" corresponding to the station you want and then hit Pause half-way through it. This is an elegant solution in some ways, but you wouldn't want to do it while driving!"
3,fragile but a good product,"This was the second iTrip I bought, after the first one broke. It was attached to the iPod and the iTrip snapped off at the connection.However, this product is a good idea and is unlike anything else. It's the only way I can think of to listen to an iPod in the car.I live in Boston and often there is interference and the iPod gets staticy."
2,Disappointment,"I was so excited when I got my iTrip in the mail! It worked really great for about a month. Then, with no warning, it stopped working completely. I am really disappointed with it and I'm not sure what I can do to get it to work again. The reception wasn't all that great to begin with."
1,Waste of money!,Disappointed it did not work well. Terrible sound! Invested in a more expensive option and love it. You gotta spend to get the best.
3,hard to learn at first,The way this thing works it's a bit hard to figure it out but it serves its purpose.
1,iTrip review,Sorely disappointed with this product. Very crackly sound at best and not user friendly.
1,Don't waste your money,"The reception is poor quality at best. More static and buzzing sounds come through this device than music. After trying every available channel I contacted Griffin Support, their explanation was that I live in a big city with many radio stations causing the problems. ""Big city""? My population is less than 1 million. guess you have to live on farm to get good quality sound out of an itrip."
2,"Was fine while it lasted, which was about 4 months","I bought this transmitter just before going up to school. It worked fine up until about a week ago. The connection on the bottom of the transmitter started to pop out, I didn't know what to do about it so I left it, it still worked but after a few days it completely came off and will not work anymore. Not Recommended especially for the price I bought it for...."
5,This is excellent,"I have yet to listen to my ipod with headphone. This transmitter is excellent. If you want digital quality songs through your system, you will be better off with cables. But the portability of this thing is amazing. I drove from Texas to Philly and never listened to a song more than once. Without the ipod, I would have to carry bunch of cds. THis transmitter makes playing in the car easy, where I listen to most of the music. I have used it at parties too and it is pretty good."
5,Works Well,I got this and it works very well in my Car- 1999 Passat-I also have the car charger and thus car trips are not a problem...I don't get the static that some have spoken about- only when my volume on my ipod is not high enough do I get that.
1,Not a robust performer,"There seems to be a bit of debate over whether this device works well or not. I can't vouch for every car and radio make there is, but I have tried it in two Hondas (old and new) a Mercedes, a Volvo, and a Subaru, as well as on my home stereo (Panasonic) and if you hold it at just the right angle, within 5 feet of the radio, and don't jiggle it too much, you can get it to work pretty well. However, if you don't like to drive with your knees while balancing your ipod to get proper reception, it just doesn't work that well. Staticky interludes will drive you nuts and so will the fact that there are other devices that don't have these problems. Try something else."
3,It's Better Than Nothing,"If you're like me and don't have a cassette player in your car (Audi TT) and want to have your beloved iPod by your side, this may be the way to go. The other choice is the Belkin TuneCast II. Sure, the sound is not much better than an average radio station but what other choice do we have? The iTrip powers itself off of the iPod so no need for a power source unlike the TuneCast."
2,Does not fit the Ipod Nano,"Before you buy this...make sure you understand that it does not do as advertised. I assume they made this before the Ipod Nano was introduced, because this ad, AND the front of the box says ""works with all ipods"", its very small and not user friendly...but hey, doesnt really matter when it doesnt fit the Nano, now does it?"
2,I guess if you can get it to work,"It's a drag. Every time you get in your car, you gotta re-program the damn thing: so a quick trip to the store you might as well listen to the radio.Other than that, this thing worked GREAT for about three days. Then, in the middle of my commute, it just went to STRAIGHT STATIC. I tried all the other little stations and what not and they didn't work either.Not worth the bother. I just bought the belkin cassette thinger. My car didn't like the first one I bought, but it seemed to like the second one okay: so far...That's gotten some bad amazon reviews also. Right now, I'm breaking the law by listening to my ipod with my headphones. Breaking the law! Breaking the law!!!"
1,itrip - good idea but works very poorly,I purchased an itrip only to return it very quickly. I found that it worked very poorly and I was far happier with an existing adapter for my cassette deck in my car. The reception from the ipod was simply unacceptable. I am still hoping for a better implementation and have found others that I am willing to try. But don't waste you money on an itrip fm adapter for your ipod.
3,Looks neat,"Sorry folks this is NOT an absolute answer, it has the same performance (which is not much) as the rest of the competition, the advantage is that it essentially matches the iPod, self power from the iPod battery, and can be tuned to any available frequency.HOWEVER!There is a hack (search the web) to boost the signal power, however you are still at the mercy of your stereo competing for other frequency which cause interference.If you are a serious iPod road warrior and want absolute crystal clear audio HiFi, you need to install an AUX input adapter, which connects to your stock/aftermarket stereo (if your stereo does not already have RCA input jacks).BLITZSAFE -dont be fooled by the name, they are leaders in the industry, there are others brands like P.I.E. and SoundGate, which work well too.Just do it."
1,Is not compatible with latest model of the Ipod Shuffle,"I bought this to go w/my husband's Ipod Shuffle. He has the latest version of the Shuffle, the one w/the click wheel. I was under the impression, based on the description of this product, that it would be compatible. Unfortunately it is not. Wish I had known before I went and ordered it."
4,Best FM option,"I love my iTrip. It works exactly as expected and seldom lets me down. I live in an area with a fairly dense FM dial (Seattle/Tacoma) and I can always find a station. Static usually comes in 2 forms for me: if my car is next to a public bus or when my cell phone changes towers or receives calls/messages. For some reason, our public buses around here generate a lot of static on the lower FM frequencies (87.x). My T-Mobile phone sometimes generates a brief burst of tones through the iTrip, too. Other than those two annoyances, my iTrip is perfect.The best features are it's size and portability. The inline power adapter/FM transmitter combo devices limit you to your car whereas the iTrip can be used with any FM radio."
3,"Decent performer in the boonies, but not so hot in the city","When I first tried the iTrip out in my friend's car, it didn't work so hot. But, in my vehicle it worked well, once I got out of the city and onto the highway. I only was able to set it to 87.9 since that was the factory setting. Works well - especially well with my indoor table radio! Neat buy."
1,Poor sound quality,I used the Itrip in Dallas where there are many radio stations and the quality was BAD... So bad I could not stand it and return it. You hear all kind of static noises and you lose a lot of the quality. So bad that radio sound 10 times better... :-(
2,Broke in a week,"Worked fine with good quality FM sound, but the connector broke in less than one week with just a few hours use. Must be pretty bad quality control, since I saw another review with the same problem."
2,shoddy,"I am currently on my third itrip. The first one lasted the longest, a whopping 4 months. The second I had only a month before it broke, and i recieved a new one for Christmas, we shall see how this one holds up.I have few complaints with the broadcasting quality. Sometimes it refuses to transmit over the selected station, but occasional glitches are to be expected with electronics like this, and since i usually just play music from a playlist, i avoid the risk of it changing stations on its own through shuffle.my main complaint is with the quality of the itrip itself. both of my itrips broke the same way! the plug that goes into the ipod dislodges from the white shell exposing the delicate wires. After this happens, you may try to stick the plug back into the white part, but there is no hope, it will not stay in for long. Soon the wires will break rendering the itrip useless. Both were damaged during everyday use of my ipod, putting it in and out of my bag or taking the itrip out. beware."
1,Not worth your money!,"I've been through three ITrips in less than five months. They suddenly stopped working, wouldn't respond, the light wouldn't come on, etc. I finally called and emailed Griffin Technology to tell them I thought they were selling a faulty product. They responded by telling me to watch the video on their website about re-tuning the Itrip. (This after I told them all troubleshooting options failed to solve the problem) Then I was basically told ""sorry your Itrip doesn't work"". They didn't offer any more help or a refund for the product.I returned my third (and final) ITrip back to the store where I purchased it. I told their customer service that if I ran the store, I would stop selling such a lousy product.There are other options out there if you want to listen to your Ipod in the car. Some are more pricey, but I will never buy another product from Griffin Techonology."
2,Nice concept poor execution,"The iTrip looks great and the ability to change channels via the iPod is nice, but it simply does not work well--a more powerful transmitter might be helpful.BTW, for those of you that have this or buy this, if you uncheck the frequency selection MP3 files in your iTunes library, it will skip them in shuffle mode, etc."
5,Exceeds Expectations,"I've been needing an FM solution for my iPod because the car I drive most often does not have the option of a cassette connection. I read the reviews for all the different products and settled on this one.I was aware that audio quality can vary depending on how crowded your local frequencies are, but I've had great success in all of my cars and my home radio.I would recommend this product highly. It's easy to use and it looks snazzy on top of your iPod. My only regret is that I didn't purchase it from Amazon because I paid WAY more at Radio Shack."
1,Does NOT work with the new Video ipod,"I just got this in the mail and it is not compatible with the new ipod video, so if that's what you are buying this for, forget it. i dunno if they even have an itrip out for the video ipod yet."
1,itrip to the rear,the itrip sounds cool but it does not work in either of our cars unless we put the ipod in the rear of the SUV to be hear the entenna.... We have an acura mdx and a lexus rx300 and both have an antenna in the rear of the car. Neither car picked up the transmission from the front seat... So I am off to buy yet another accessory.
1,Absolutely Worthless,"This device simply does not work well. It's FM transmitter is nowhere near powerful - even on clear channels, the Itrip is overwhlemed by outside interference making it almost impossible to listen to.Compared with a satellite radio equipped with FM transmitter - this is really pathetic.I'm no engineer, but I suspect that it is because it is only powered by the Ipod itself. If you want an FM transmitter for your Ipod - get a powered one!"
1,Very poor reception in Dallas,Bought this along with the Griffin auto charger. None of the pre-programmed frequencies work well in the Dallas area...lots of static and background noise.
3,Works okay kind of not very impressive,I am using this in my car but even after frequency matching and all sometimes it doesn't give the desired performance. It is prone to noise and disturbance not very clear only at times when only radio is on and car is not being driven. Though I won't say its bad but it should surely be improved.
4,Good deal,I just got my iTrip and tested it with my car radio. Finding the frequency is very easy. Radio produced little bit noise when in a crowded area but otherwise the sound quality was good. I think overall it is a good deal for this price.
2,Not worth it,"I bought is so that I could take my ipod anywhere and have music just in case.I was the in highlands, the ipod with the itrip were right next to the stereo antena and the reception was scratchy.I recommend getting additional sets of stereo cables to connect to an auxiliary source, far better sound quality wihout any fuzz."
2,Not useful driving around Los Angeles/San Diego,"I regularly drive between and around the Los Angeles and San Diego areas. The radio dial is very dense so there are few frequencies that are useful. I also regularly hit areas of interference (high power lines, military and telcom equipment) along I-215, I-15 between the I-10 and San Diego, and I-805. I'm constantly flipping to different frequencies. Quite disappointing.Indoors, I like to use the iTrip to transmit to my bookcase stereo system but I still can't get more than 12 feet away."
1,Did not work satisfactorily.,"I'm sorry to say that in my opinion this is not a good accessory for the Ipod. The FM transmitter is notably weaker than other accessories that are available for the same purpose, which surprised me since this FM transmitter has a bigger antenna than the others. But no, this one produces more static and less signal, simple as that.Further, the design of this unit is questionable. It uses song files to control the frequency of the unit, which is a clunky approach in several ways. For example, if you put the Ipod on shuffle, you sometimes hit the FM frequency file, with unsatisfactory results. Not good.Pass this one up. There are better alternatives."
1,Waste of money...,"I wasted $30 on this piece of crap!!!!I live in the middle of suburbia ohio. The Itrip shouldn't have problems transmitting, since the nearest radio station is at least 40 miles away, and yet it did. I constantly had to switch frequencies, which is no easy task when driving. So many near car accidents!!Sound quality was awful. When I COULD find a station that worked, there was often background static, and sometimes the iTrip didn't do its job 100% and let some of the radio station play. I tried many different stations, and this occurred frequently.My itrip stopped working all together a couple weeks ago. That's right. IT BROKE. It doesn't transmit whatsoever. It stopped lighting up. Thank god it didn't break my iPod or there'd be blood to spill.You get what you pay for. If you want an inefficient, poorly-made FM transmitter that will most likely break on you within a month or two, please buy this item."
2,Simply put: DOES NOT DO THE JOB,"Griffin is a great brand (I like their other products), but this FM transmitter reduces the crystaline ipod sound quality to a hissing, fade-and-surge mess. I was very disappointed, and was too busy at work to return it within the return window. The cassette link offered elsewhere is not much better, in terms of sound quality and logistics. The only satisfying way to link ipod to car radio is the direct connection BMW, Volvo and others are now offering (can also be retro-fitted at custom shops). I do not like to slam products (as my other reviews here prove), but I want to ensure others are not similarly disappointed. Caveats: sound does come out, just not clear sound. Could be that my city (Seattle) doesn't have the optimal radio spectrum."
5,Love it!!!!!!!!!!,"This is amazing. Just don't turn up the volume on the ipod too high or it distorts. The only other problem I've found is that sometimes the radio frequency you select will have to be changed as you travel into an area where the signal is being used. Otherwise this product is outstanding. I'm a traveling party with this thing. My music - any radio, any place, any time."
2,Not an ideal solution,"I had a hard time getting the iTrip to work, and even when it did, it was still on the static-y side. It comes and goes: sometimes it works -- and not that well -- and sometimes it just decides not to. Maybe it's because I live in a city where there are radio stations for nearly every spot on the dial. Yesterday I went through every FM station and got nothing. All these FM-based products are just a patch until car stereos become more iPod-friendly. I'm almost tempted to buy a BMW so I can just plug the damn thing in. Almost."
2,drains the battery,It works pretty good...when there is a quite part in the song you can hear so much static. It doesnt work good with the system in my car...doesnt put out a strong enough signal for a loud bass. the main problem is tho that my 12 hour battery completly drains in 5 hours. Reviews say that it barely uses the ipods battery..........this is so false....i listened to it for 2 hours and the bar was half gone....i suggest rca cables instead or keeping the ipod plugged in while listening
3,Three stars sums it up...,"Well, it's not bad, it's just not very good... where to start?The physical design is okay. It's durable. I drop it just about every time I get out of my car, taking it off the iPod to hit the hold switch while carrying a number of items-- this in itself is a problem, since it'd be nice if the hold switch was left exposed. Otherwise, it looks fine...The iTrip is very moody. Sometimes it just doesn't work; I have to reset my iPod and then go through the whole bothersome process of setting the frequency. The software's terrible, and it's such a bother to set the frequencies, especially while driving.As for the sound quality-- it's not great, and often it fades out and delivers a troublesome amount of static and noise. The frequency range is limited. I drive a volvo, which has the antenna in the back of the car, so this could be the reason, but even in other cars that have front antennas, the quality's still mediocre at best. Stick with a tape, if you have a tape player..."
4,It's a great thing but not for every place,"Well, I've just bought my iPod with my iTrip and I'm very pleased with what I got, here in Mexico it works great! And I said that because I bought it during a week I spent at the US, first in Orlando and then in Miami, in Orlando it worked just fine, like in Mexico City, but in Miami it's impossible to make it work because of the saturation of the FM spectrum...So...if you live in a city like Miami, forget it, but if you don't, go for it. You wont regret."
2,Expected a better product for the price.,"I use the iTrip in my car mostly. It has to be placed right next to the radio (not the antenna) to come in clear. Anywhere else fills my music with unbearable static. Also, the iTrip dramatically reduces my iPod's battery. I would be getting 10-12 hours, but using this thing drops me to 4-5 if I'm lucky."
1,great idea poor execution,its a good idea. however griffin executed iTRIP poorly. The frequency doesn't reach my car stero.not recommmended product.
2,Works while it lasts - UPDATE,"This performs great. I live in Southern California and if you leave it tuned to 87.9, it works great in most areas. HOWEVER, both mine and my wife's iTrip quit transmitting after a few months. I would go for the new AirPlay - it's smaller and easier to use.UPDATE - After ""retuning"" it a couple of times, it works like new."
2,"too much static, sound is substandard","I was very excited when I purchased the itrip as I didn't want to go throught the trouble of running cables/wires through my car. I figured that the FM transmitter would be sufficient for my driving to work and such... boy, was I wrong. I agree with the other posts that this device suffers from too much interference even on empty frequencies! I live in an area that does not crowd the airwaves and even then I receive quite a bit of static that is even more noticeable when the hard drive searches in between songs (annoying). The sound quality is terrible and is akin to listening to a radio through a tin can. I purchased this device this morning and intend to either return it or sell it on ebay tomorrow. A good idea (although the playlist problem is annoying as well) and good design which delivers what it promises but does it poorly."
3,Very poor transmiting signal,"Ok the principal problem is that the signal sometimes is ok but sometimes is just the worst and the signal always sounds like dirty, no clear sound.Is a very good size very portable and easy to handle. I haven't try others but I can imagine that is something better out there."
2,wrong,it does not fit all iphones this is for the old models.mailed it back I dont even no if I receive a refund.
4,Griffin iTrip for Classic iPod,This is a replacement for a unit I have used for years. It works well when the radio does not have a wored connector. The Vendor was superb.
5,I POD FM Broadcaster,"Well worth the money!If you have an I pod you need this for your car , stereo, RV it works where ever you have a FM Radioyour music goes with you."
1,Just doesn't cut it.,"The problems I have with this product are not specific to just this product but to all ipod-to-FM devices. The sound quality is just terrible and it is very hard to find a middle of the band station to use. Basically you get the best speaker sound separation when you use a station in the middle of all the stations. If you live in a metro area this is impossible, and even out here in SD it is pretty much impossible. Also FM just cannot handle low end bass sounds and causes the sound to crackle when any bass is introduced.Bottom Line: Just find another way to hook up the ipod. If you have a tape deck use a cassette tape converter. If not then find some way to rig the ipod to the sound system using rca cords. Using FM devices just makes music sound horrible."
1,poor reception,"Having been very happy with apple's smart design on so many products, I was surprised to find that such a poor products as this is promoted in their stores. The reception is terrible, with lots of hisses and pops that get worse the longer you use it. I thought it was just me, but my friend who also bought one reports the same issues. Hopefully the new models work better."
1,don't buy this,"Your first problem with this non-transmitter is turning it on. About half the time it doesn't. If the company says it's in sleep, read coma for sleep. Then there's the problem with transmitting. This is rabbit-ears technology: you usually need to be touching it for it to come in. Remember watching the Orioles in the world serieses (sp) in the late 60's-early 70's? Someone would have to hold the rabbit-ears for the station to come in? That's this thing. And if you drive by overhead power or telephone wires, forget it."
1,2 down and 2 to go.,"The only thing that takes a trip is the ITRIP.I have bought 3, 2 for friends and one for me.Mine I have returned once for a replacent and now thereplacement doesn't work. One of my friend's ITRIP alsostopped working."
1,fm transmitter,The transmitter doesn't work. I tried everything I could think of to try and make it work but it doesnt.
4,Well worth the investment,"The ITrip makes listening to the Ipod in your car very easy. YOu simply plug the Itrip into the top of the Ipod and tune your radio to a blank station(I use 87.9) and that's it!!!!No Wires, No charger, Just the Ipod. The Itrip is small, so it will not weigh down the Ipod and again, with no wires, you can just rest the Ipod on the dash or on the passenger seat or in your lap and you are ready to go!!Sometimes, there is a little static. The battery life of the Ipod is pretty significantly shortened(my Ipod is supposed to last 5 hours on one full charge; with the Itrip it is more like 3 1/2), but these minor setbacks don't matter to me; because I always have 7500 songs in my car with no fuss!!!For $20.00, you simply cannot go wrong!!ENJOY"
5,iTrip - best alternative,"For those of us with only a CD player, the iTrip is the best alternative. Ideally, the cassette adapter produces better sound quality but, with some fiddling, the itrip can sound pretty good. I have an accord coupe with tinted windows and a radio antenna wired into the back window so I was prepared for the worst when i got my itrip. But it has performed pretty well and I am happy with it. I live in DC but go to school in Ithaca NY so hopefully the FM band will be a lot less congested when I go back. Short of all of us getting BMWs with seamless ipod integration, the itrip is the best way for us to be able to play all our tunes on the road."
4,No strings attached,I like this product a lot. I debated between the iTrip and Monster's icarplay. I liked the simplicity and portability of the itrip better. Setup was easy. I recommend not using the included cd and going to Griffin's website and getting the latest software. I like the fact that the whole FM spectrum can be utilized.
2,"complex setup; when done, performance rates D-","I purchased this thing at Radio Shack today. It was ""on sale"" for $29.97, plus tax, or $32.48. I thought I was getting a bargain. Took it home, spent a good hour installing the software, reading all instructions, and then tested on my (excellent) home radio, as well as on my (poor) portable radio-in-an-earphone. I had to fiddle with the thing quite a bit to find an FM frequency that was more or less open. The performance on the radio was C; not good enough to enjoy music. The performance on the portable radio was F+, so I give it an overall of D-. It might work in some way on a car radio, but I'm too disgusted to try. I have a wired setup to play my iPod in the car. (I was hoping to avoid wires when I bought this thing). I'm bringing it back to Radio Shack tomorrow, hoping to get a refund."
4,91.9 works perfect in Los Angeles,I've had the iTrip for about a year now. It's been good to me.Pros:1. Powered by iPod2. No wires3. Decent sound (some hiss)4. Low priceCons:1. Needs to be reset from time to time2. Changing iTrip frequencies is a hassleRecommendations:1. Take the time to read the manual and figure how to change frequencies on the iPod to control the iTrip2. Pick a station that as far away from any used stations as possible3. Turn iPod on a off a few times when iTrip is not responding4. A charger improves reception a car
1,not reliable,"In the 3 cars that we have used this product in, reception is unstable. There is a lot of intermittent hiss and interference. Another problem is fit - if you use a skin on your iPod, you will have to remove it so that the iTrip plugs all the way in. Too bad I didn't research this more carefully before buying!"
1,Works great... for awhile,"I've owned two of these and they worked great, but both stopped working after a few months. I'm going to try another brand and hopefully I'll have better luck."
2,doesn't work for everyone,"My initial excitement was put down minutes after I found out, the little cool looking device doesn't work well with my car!!! You'll have to put the unit right by the car antenna, which is unrealistic. I was very very disappointed. If you can try it out ahead of the time, do yourself a favorite and do it. Unless you like it so bad that you are willing to go through some modifications with your car by running antenna extension wire to the front and all that. (I had an Integra and a TSX) Volume sucks too."
2,"Good, not Great","The iTrip does what it is supposed to, but not in an outstanding way. The signal strength is not usually too strong, and has to compete with inescapable static and interferance, no matter what station it is set on.If you haven't already bought this, buy something else."
2,not impressed,"I use my Ipod in my truck almost exclusively, often for several hours per day. I had been using a transmitter that charges the Ipod while playing and was very happy with it, but had problems with my Ipod hard drive crashing, 3 times in fact, and HP service indicated that overcharging may have been a factor. I bought the ITrip to see if it would help. I was happy at first using the default radio seting, but after I downloaded the software into my Ipod I had a hard time getting the ITrip to lock onto a station. I also found that I got more static than the other transmitter had produced. You might have better luck in a remote area with fewer radio stations. If the default setting, 87.9, works for you, don't download the software. As it stands now I rarely use the ITrip."
2,Save your money,"I tried this in 3 different vehicles. The sound quality is poor to none. Lots of static, then no signal at all. Now I've switched to the cassette adapter, which at least works."
3,Update: things better now.,"Griffin has updated their software for the iTrip. The website is user-friendly and the install is very simple. The device works somewhat better now, though a lot will depend upon how you use it. In a car, if the unit is very far from the antenna (not the radio) or if you have heavily tinted or thick window glass, it won't be good enough for clear stereophonic differentiation.My earlier review:The design looks nice and it fits well into the 2nd gen iPod, but the functionality is not too good. With PC based machines, the software does not work and the documentation is useless. A call to their tech support folks did solve that problem, but what you're left with is a transmitter whose quality rivals that of an AM radio. Not cool."
2,"Well, it works, sort of anyway","This thing is a real disapointment. Yes, it does work but badly. Even after finding a free frequency (not easy here in the north east) the transmition and reception are marginal at best. No where near close to quality sound. I plugged in the cassette adapter from my old cd walkman and the ipod sounded fabulous that way in the car. Thankfully I didn't dump tons of money into it."
2,Not the greatest design especially for urban use,"I have had this product for approximately two weeks and have used it in both an urban environment and also in long distance travel and as far as I am concerned it is a dud. If you happen to be lucky enough to find a station where there is no interference from another signal, the itrip does indeed work. I have encountered this for at most a half an hour on a three hour journey. What generlly happens is that other stations will interfere with the station that you are listening on as you are driving. The sound quality decreases and then becomes unlistenable. In and around Boston where I am from, I have yet to find a good station. It would be great if Griffin would put up a list of channels in various regions that are good for broadcasting on. I still have hope that I can find a station to listen on without interference, but my hopes are diminishing."
1,Big City - forget it,"The iTrip just doesn't work in the New York, Northern NJ area. I tried all the recommended stations, but the sound quality is not even remotely acceptable. There is considerable static. Just terrible."
1,Shockingly bad product,"I have to say I was simply astonished at how useless this product was. Firstly the 'manual' is a waste of paper and I had to get info off the web to tell me how to install the FM channels into ITunes thru Wondows. Secondly, once you get it going, you'll wish you hadn't bothered. I've heard AM stations that sound better. Static, more static and even more static thrown in for good measure. It's no different whether you're in the car or at home. Don't waste your money. Instead, think about a wired-in option for a car set-up or make do with the headphones."
4,iTrip,"I think once you download the city finder from griffin it's real easy to get excellent reception. I had a hard time at first getting it to work well, but after looking at the city finder it was much better with the recomended stations for your area."
2,A good product for lackluster technology,"The iTrip, and products like it, are short-distance RF transmiters. This product worked well for me compared to similar products. But whenever there's a stronger signal, such as a radio station, in the vicinity, it interferes with the iTrip transmission. Basically, if you're in a remote area, it works fine. If you're in an area that has FM broadcasts close the station setting you're using, the signal will fade and generate static. For an external source like an iPod (or any other product) it's best to use a cassette tape connection. Or, if your system allows it, use a direct cable connection. If you only have a stereo with an in-dash CD player and no cassette, you're kind of screwed."
3,"Okay, but please be gentle.","It sure is pretty to look at and the concept is great, but as others have said, this gadget is best suited for people that live far removed from larger cities, so that there are plenty of free channels for the transmitter.Also... don't drop the thing, or it goes bye-bye. This was perhaps the flimsiest thing I've ever bought. I wouldn't even look at it too hard if I were to buy another one."
3,Average,I would definitely say that the iTrip makes it convient to listen to your iPod at any given location wirelessly. The quality is about average and could possibly be a little better. From what I understand that the direct connection either cigarette lighter or through the cassette tapes works alot better. The only thing is that you cannot listen to it on your home studio.
1,Worthless in Los Angeles,"I decided to try this, since my car stereo doesn't have a cassette deck or auxiliary input, and I wanted to listen to my iPod holdings in the car. I should have listened to other reviewers: This is WORTHLESS in Los Angeles. There are basically NO open frequencies on the dial, and the sound was garbage when it did transmit. I'm returning it, and planning to either have a mechanic install an auxiliary cable or have an electronics retailer install a stereo with an auxiliary input."
3,make an informed decision...,"the only reason the itrip doesnt work for some people is the particular car they have, not the inferiority of the product itself. jettas, for instance, get terrible itrip reception. i dont know why, its just a pecularity of the make. acuras suck as well. in order to make sure you wont have a bad trip, get a friend who has one to play it in your car and if it doesnt work dont buy it. people who complain about the itrip are uninformed and rushed into it. i got an itrip after trying it out in my pimp new bmw 7.45 xi and it works fabulous next to the dvd nav system and ps2. just kidding i drive a corolla, but it works just fine in it."
1,total waste of money,"I bought this for the ipod I got at christmas and it didn't do anything. For some reason it has 2 things on the bottom. An earphone connector and a random square thing that doesn't go into anything since the only hole on top of the ipod is for your headphones. Anyway I loaded up all the stations plugged it into my earphone hole and nothing happened, no light, no power, no songs, zilch. So I returned it. After I returned I saw an itrip that looked like it went in the ipod's normal connecting spot (the bottom, duh) but that was 49 dollars compared to the 19 for the regular i-trip, so I went with a competitor that just goes into the headphone hole, and actually works."
1,I ended up returning this...,"I had just bought a new iPod and wanted to bring it on a car trip. It doesn't work at all in moderately populated areas. We were driving from Sacramento to San Francisco and it hardly worked for more than 5 minutes everywhere. Right when I'd get my mp3s to come in with any clarity (albeit while holding it just right), a new station would get in our way and suddenly I'd be listening not to soothing Radiohead but Bob and Carl in the morning. This might work if you live in Iowa, but it doesn't work in populated areas."
1,Look for other options,"My iTrip worked very poorly. The static was nearly constant. I can't believe a product this bad is on the market. Everyone I asked about it (after I bought it) said the same thing. Oh, yeah, the static is a big problem. I swapped mine for a Kensington Digital FM Transmitter/Auto Charger. It plugs into the cigarette lighter. Problem solved. It is more pricey, $79 versus $49, but the difference is a product that works versus one that does not."
2,Doesn't work well if you live in the City,"So I live just north of Minneapolis and quite frankly this thing sucks. There is a ton of interference and it cuts in and out constantly, plus when the song changes and what not, you hear an annoying huge pop. However, when you get out of the Minneapolis area, and in the middle of no-where it works pretty well. If you live and plan to use this in a highly populated area, I would pass on this item and try to find a different one!"
1,Disappointing,"The iTrip transmission was initially week. When I went on the road, I couldn't get it to work at all in a rental car even after selecting alternate FM stations. Documentation did not include any troubleshooting information to remidy this problem."
1,I bought an iTrip not compatible with my iPod,"The iTrip I bought was not compatible with the iPod video I had. It was designed for an older version, but the information provided on the web was not enough to know that."
1,Bad information about this item!,The Itrip dont connect to my ipod photo. When i choose this item the information was: Compatible with the ipod photo.Very bad information!!!
3,good item for the price,"We bought this so we could play our IPod in the car. It works great when you find a working station. The CD it came with shows a listing of stations that may work in the area you're in but wasn't always accurate. Make sure you read the directions very carefully before selecting a station for it to play off of or it'll add every single station to your Ipod, which can then only be deleted when you hook it up to your computer. Quite a pain for road trips."
1,kinda lame,My wife and I used this transmiter once and bought something else. will not work in a city with a lot of radio stations.
1,Sucks,Sound was staticky regardless of placement. Finally stopped working after about 3 months. Wouldn't buy it if I were you...
4,Worth The Price,This i a good transmitter. But it still has local disturbances. Since some of the transmitters in the market have much more disturbance i would reccomend this product. Some of the transmitters equivalent to this need separate power cord but u can use them with a lot of other devices like laptop and other mp3 players. Overall if your purpose is to only use this with an ipod i would say go for it
2,Not recommended for the NY Metro Area,"I am disappointed by the performance of this device. It is great in concept, but in practice I find that it is very sensitive to being placed just so in the car, and needs constant attention to keep working reasonably well. Even at its best, audio quality suffers considerably - the MP3/AAC format is already a step down from CD quality, and sonic quality suffers further with the crush into FM. Not surprisingly, the NY metro area is not friendly to this device. The instructions suggest finding a frequency that is only static, preferably with frequencies on either side that are also only static. In my daily travels through the area, no such space exists. Not recommended."
2,Not that great,This device has weak power. Good luck if your car has one of the newer style antennas for the car. I was not impressed with the iTrip.
2,There are much better FM modulators available now...,"When I purchased this product many years ago, it was an amazing device. It was powered by the iPod itself and allowed frequency changes directly from the iPod as well.Since then, FM modulator technology has increased by leaps and bounds. The iTrip produces a constant, high-frequency tone that's higher than most people's hearing range. Not mine, unfortunately. The iTrip also required special tone files to be loaded into your iTunes playlist to change frequencies. Not a big deal, but a little cumbersome.Note that this product does not work with current iPods."
3,griffin white iTrip 4 iPod,"This item is no longer available in stores around me, and now I can see why. This item worked GREAT when it arrived but after about a week and a half of use, there was nothing but static. I know things are not made to last, but only a week and a half?"
2,Neat Idea...if Only There was Good Reception,"I love the idea the Apple guys came up with. I just wish I could find a station that transmits a clear signal upon syncing my iPod. I live in South Florida, which is for the most part suburban/metropolitan...no rural dead zones. I find myself changing stations TOO often when driving, which could be a very dangerous task to undertake. If you can afford the investment, given your car's stereo system is interchangeable, purchase a moderate Pioneer CD player that has the iPod jack compatability (also made by Pioneer). Now, this combination sounds like heaven!"
3,Decent,"The FM transmitter works fairly well. The problem with it is that if you driving between cities, the station you have it set to often gives out and then you are forced to change the station it is transmitting on, which if you're driving alone is not exactly easy. This is a problem with FM transmitters in general, though it may be true that better ones will hold the signal through more interference. Works fine within a city."
1,unreliable,"I bought an itrip for my ipod about 10 months ago. I really didn't use it very much. When I did, it seemed to work okay at best. The other day I tried it and it didn't work at all. The light lit up but that was it. It gave out no signal what so ever. I tried everything I could think of, nothing worked. I went to the electronics store where I got it and they told me that they had had a lot of complaints on it so they had stopped carrying it a few months earlier. I got a monster made device which charges the ipod while you are using it in your car. Much better. My advice to all is to stay away from this semi unreliable (at best) device which is ready to die at any time!"
3,Works great on stereos with bad reception.,"This transmitter works well only if there are no other signals trying to get through. So if you live in a city (I live in Los Angeles) you find that signal strength varies almost from block to block. This means that when something is trying to come through on the station you've selected, your iPod signal will suffer and therfore your listening pleasure will as well.This thing workd great with my alarm clock, but thats because it can't pull a signal at all. So, in summary, if you have a great stereo in your car and live where there are lots of stations, wait for something better. If you live in bfe go for it. Also, it's a pain to try and search for a song while driving. The iPod is not driver freindly. That should be the next inovation. But that doesn't have anything to do with the Transmitter."
3,"ok, but not anything special","I bought this for use in my car, thinking it would sound like a normal radio broadcast. However, there is a fair amount of static, and even the slightest movement of the iTrip causes major increases in background noise. If you REALLY want this then get it, but i would recommend an alternative product."
4,Working as expected.,It is working as expected but will it last in the hands of a teenager. This thing is being used every chance the teen is driving the car.
2,You get what you pay for...,"If you're looking for an easy way to play your iPod through your car speakers, don't want to spend a lot of money, and have infinite patience as reception levels on various channels fades in and out, the iTrip is your answer.If you're looking for an easy way to play your iPod through your car speakers and want consistent reception, bite the bullet and pay for a professionally-installed, hardwired FM transmitter.Our experience with the iTrip was frustrating at best. Of course, it was great for vacations involving a lot of driving of a rental car. But as an everyday solution to the iPod-car trip connection, the iTrip thoroughly failed. If you live in an urban environment with a large amount of FM airwave usage, reception (static) can change drastically from block to block."
2,"It works, barely.",I think this works only when the battery is really charged. There is a lot of static. I'd try something else before getting one of these.
2,ok..first try but not good enough,Summary: overall it works but trying to tune to a radio station is a horrible process; horrible UI or lack there ofPros: uses existing power of iPod and snuggles on top of playerCons: When you play random all files on your iPod you also play all the iTrip mp3 files; static is noticeable; No seperate UI for use of application on iPod which forces you to may a playlist of all iTrip mp3 files; trying to find a radio station in the Bay Area that is clear is very hard
2,Skip it if you plan to use it while driving,If you are buying this to use in your car forget it. The signal is weak and on a few occations the signal fades and cuts out. Prob due to other radio stations. I did find it better if you have a car charger for your iPod. It seems to boost the signal up a bit.
1,Misleading/False Item description,To be more customer oriented I would recommend changing the false/misleading product description. The iTrip for iPod only works with certain iPods and certainly does not work with the new 5th generation video iPod. So the result was a complete waste of my time and money to purchase a product that does not do what it's product description implies.
1,DOESN'T WORK WITH THE NEW iPOD VIDEO,"The new iPod with video doesn't have a ""docket"" next to the earphone plug, so this product just wont fit..."
1,Don't waste your money,"Buy yourself a hammer and smash your thumb, then go buy a different product. You'll be in less pain then if you buy this and you'll have a hammer when you're done which is actually useful (as opposed this this thing). Difficult to tune, terrible reception and mediocre audio quality."
1,No wonder Amazon is throwing for free,"I ordered this item as Amazon is throwing item for free along 20GB Ipod. Later on, I cancelled this order after reading the comments."
3,Short range,"I don't know if this product is bad or if the problem is to find a free station where I live (Recife/BR). The product it self is easy to use, small but its transmittion is not so good! I tried it at my place, my girlfriend's, at my car and a friend's car too....and it works only when I place it on certain parts of my roon or on my lap at my car. I was expecting a better product. Sorry. Maybe if Griffin increase the power of the transmition....I think that would help. I know there are goverment policies..but....who knows....it can be change."
2,Weak signal,"Used it in my car. The signal was weak at best, and the quality equivalent to a cell phone. Ease of use and set up was challenging as well. Better off puchasing an IPOD stereo adapter. Can work much better in your house."
2,Doesn't last,"The initial itrip I received lasted only a few weeks before it simply stopped working. I could not think of any reason that it stopped working, it wasn't mishandled, dropped, or anything that would physically harm it. I sent it back for a replacement, which lasted a few months before the same thing happened. While it was working I was satisfied with it's performance (considering the price tag), but I didn't expect it to be a disposable item."
2,Not For Your Car...,"If you want to use it to listen to your home stereo or out in the garage, then this works fine. But do not think about using it to replace that cassette adapter you have in your car. I tried it in my Dodge Interpid for a week and was tired of the AM radio sound quality. Went back to my cassette adapter.It works okay in my wifes Chrysler T&C; though. Go figure."
4,iTrip is awesome,"I never thought I would use an iPod because I rarely have the opportunity to wear headphones. Then I discovered the iTrip FM transmitter and immediately realized I could get rid of the numerous CD cases in my car and replace them with an iPod+iTrip. I love not having to manage wires for a cassette converter or wired FM transmitter like I used to do with my portable CD player.I also use my iPod+iTrip at home with our kitchen radio mounted under the cabinets. Works great with the exception of some occassional interference, especially in the car. I haven't tried changing the frequency, but I suspect that would help.One tip: Don't max out the volume of the iPod when using the iTrip or the sound will be distorted. Keep it between 50%-75% and it should work fine."
1,i-crap,"this thing is horrible. if you listen to anything with bass, you will be very disappointed. i wish i could return mine. actually i may sell it used on amazon if you're interested."
2,Not very good,"I got this as a combo deal with the 20GB iPod. It works, but if you want a quality sound in your car, and live in a Metropolitan area, don't buy this. There is way too much interference with radio stations. Even in a clear area the sound is not crisp. The tuning of the transmitter is easy though."
3,You can live with it,"I think it's pretty good. I use it mostly to listen to my iPod in the shower using my water-resistant radio, but I've also used it to play my iPod at friends' houses because they don't have a conveniently located set of speakers that use a headphone jack. They're by no means perfect. I get a lot of static in the shower because I have to keep my iPod 4 feet away, through a sheet of glass and under a washcloth to prevent the moisture from destroying it. But it's bearable. I didn't get these because I wanted perfect sound reception. When I'm at friends' houses and I put it really close to their radio it works amazingly well. So they really depend on what you need. But I'm satisfied."
2,Bad iTrip,"Well I had a Bad iTrip. The thing was a knobathon to get going in the car while driving (and that was with my CoPilot) and when i 'luckily' found a station almost by accident, it sounded terrible. Like an MP3 thru an FM channel or an FM station thru a tin can.it has been returned - up for auction it goes.(++ on the plus side the design and concept were way too cool - it hooked me. It might take 2-5 years to perfect the technology maybe then i'll try again...but for now it definitely sucks.)"
1,terrible reception,"The itrip seems to have a sweet spot a few inches from my radio, unfortuantely I have to hold it suspended in the air there. Everywhere else there is too much static. I have great reception for regular radio stations. I have tried a couple different frequencies- including those suggested in the station finder."
1,These things are garbage,"TWO of these broke on me, snapped right in half from normal wear and tear. They are cheaply made and another fine examples of the millions that companies milk off of all of us iPod suckers. Sure you get the cool iPod, but what? You want to listen to it in your car: $60. You want to protect it? $40 You want to put it through speakers? $20 You want to charge it? $40 Crappy headphones broke? $50 WHAT A RIP-OFF!"
2,"Neat Idea, But Not Good for Major Cities Like LA","If you live in an area with relatively few FM stations, this transmitter would be great. If I stay in one place, I can find a station and the reception is great -- comparable to the megawatt radio stations.I bought this device to be able to play my iPod through my stereo in my car when I commute (50 miles across greater Los Angeles area). Unfortunately, there isn't an appropriate station that isn't overridden throughout the entire drive.Luckily, for cities with fewer stations, there is a utility that Griffin provides that will tell you what station(s) you should use, based on your metropolis. Unfortunately, both stations listed for LA are in use somewhere along my drive, making this device useless for my purposes."
2,It's annoying,"It works fine, but the multitude of stations that are loaded onto your ipod are annoying. if you leave the ipod playing on browse, it will ""play"" a station, thereby changing it so that the transmittor will stop working until you re-program it. I use the transmittor that radio shack sells and it works perfectly, albeit it is a little bulkier."
2,Not impressed,"I've used both the iTrip and belkin's tuncast. In all honesty I wasn't impressed with either. The sound quality is just plain awful, full of noise and static. Everytime I took a turn in my car it would cut out for a second. While the iTrip does have more frequencies than the Belkin version the method that you change them are awkward and takes up HD space on your iPod. My advice is to skip the whole FM transmitter concept altogether until they come up with something better."
1,Poor sound quality,"I am extrememly dissappointed with this product. For the first few weeks it worked ok, but after the that the signal strength and sound quality got worse and worse. If I'm going to pay $300 for a iPod with digital quality sound-- I want digital quality sound! The sound with the transmitter was almost as bad as AM radio. Spring for the extra money and get an adapter for you car stereo."
2,adequate?,"I got this thing @$21+ free shipping... if I had bought it at the store for $40 I probably would have returned it. In one car it always has some overlap from the radio (this is in Chicago, to be fair), so everything sounds like a worn record (who says you can't get the same sound from digital?). In the other car, the reception is better, but the problem is vibration-- the itrip doesn't line up flush with the back of the ipod, and if you have it resting on a hard surface (most that are close enough to the stereo to work are), road vibration can cause the itrip to suddenly transmit a disorienting blast of noise through your speakers. Tapping the unit will bring back the music... but I don't enjoy the sudden jolt while driving. I'm thinking of trying a direct connection to the antenna imput instead."
1,"iCrap, I mean iTrip",Our iTrip worked OK for the first 30 days (see return policy). We live in a rural area and we encountered a bit of interferance but it usually did not last long. There were no radio stations near the iPod station so that seemed unusual. I would imagine that if you live in a more urban area this might be more of an issue. However the cheap mini pin plug that connects the iTrip to the iPod broke off 31 days after purchase (see return policy). This just added to the hassel of getting an iPod that actually works. So figuring in the two weeks we were dealing with the first iPod the iTrip only saw about 2 weeks of use before breaking. Great job Griffin!!
2,"neat concept, bad implementation","I like being able to transmit my music to FM, and it has a decent range, but the method this device has for changing the broadcast frequency is really annoying. You have to play a song which beeps at the device to signal the change, and then pause it as soon as it understands.... anyway, it's annoying because you have to stop whatever music you're playing to change it, and sometimes the songs come up on shuffle.There are better products that transmit to FM; I had to get this one because it was part of a package deal."
1,Weak Interpretations of the Classic Songs,"This book has EXTREMELY poor tabs of all the songs, not the actual versions. Unless you are a total beginner, this is NOT the book you want. Dig around and find the old guitar mags instead otherwise you'll be disappointed like I was."
3,Return of the Warrior,"While I love Kinley, this was not her best work, I found Christian tiresome and well not likeable to begin with, but he grew on me like you'd expect. But I'm still left with the thought, what would I have written differently, if this character was mine, and I realy can't think of any difference, this is was the natural way for this character to go. Is this book a must read, yes, if you want to follow the series."
4,"My first Kinley McGregor novel, but not my last","As I said, this was my first book by this author and I thought it was fantastic and unique. I have since read the others in the series (the short story in ""Where's My Hero"" and ""Champion""). Any fan of this author will love this book. If you like historical romances, this series is unique. I cannot wait to find out which member of the Brotherhood she will write about next!"
5,Deep Sigh!!!,"I love Kinley's books. I love Knights and Scottish Highlanders. I love a hero and heroine that love each other and not afraid to fight about what the want. I love the passion.This book had all that, so I Sigh.......and what for the next book."
3,Not so hot,"I like a crisp, light waffle. This iron just doesn't get hot enough to attain either crispness or lightness. It bakes well but the result is halfway between a waffle and a pancake."

It only reminds the reader of the illegitimate Anglo-American Hindu love affair whose illegitimate literary off-spring is the inquuiry of an Occidental in the Bengali Hindu's Kama Sutra, as seen from the author's point of departure and deliberation on Jibananda Das."
4,Dreamy,"I love this film! It has just the right blend of comedy, action and romance. With a little fantasy thrown in. Chow Yun Fat is very good as the somewhat confused CIA agent sent to China to recover a ""treasure"". The main story takes place at a temple with a cute little boy monk among all the adults. The ""treasure"" turns out to be a strange young woman and the two have many adventures on the way to falling in love. A real gem for mature women fans of CYF.This was a fun and fanciful film. I agree with another reviewer - Chow looks great and has more range in this film. Not just the macho mow-um-down man (although there are gun scenes), there is also some comedy and romance. Since I had never heard of this one I was pleasantly surprised."
3,Good for developing minds not great.,My kids love to play with these. THey can built whatever they want with relative ease. Both of my 4 year olds and my two year old all have no problem building with these. THey are fascinated with them. The only downside is that these toys may not hold mom and dad's attention. You can build whatever you want with ease. There is just not many things with such streight lines that you can build. Bottom Line: Great for kids. Not so much for adults.
5,Excellent Leadership Lessons,"The movie is framed as a jury trial to determine whether General Nobile's choices constitute failure in leadership and dereliction of duty in this doomed North Pole expedition. The trial is convened by Nobile himself during one of his countless sleepless nights even forty years after the events under question. The jury, those whose lives were ended or changed by the expedition, is called up in Nobile's mind to recount the story and render a verdict. This works very well as a case study in leadership, planning and contingencies, rebellion, failure, and forgiveness. Used in a teaching setting on leadership, this is one of the most compelling dramas I've seen on the topic. Sean Connery's role is not large, but his presence in the movie renders it a little more accessible to today's viewers."
4,A memorable scene which will leave you breathless,"There is one scene in The Red Tent in which a rapidly receeding disaster scene is viewed from the perspective of a momentary survivor, who is rising with the doomed remnant of a derelict lighter-than-air craft. You know this soul is doomed, too, because of the nature of the disaster which has just occurred. The scene has lodged in my mind for many years since I first saw it. Astonishing film making."
4,Too cold for me.,I have seen this film a couple times on TV and enjoyed it very much. I have always been interested in explorer and exploration. The only bad part was the so-called love story part of the film. It had no place in this film.
5,This is great stuff!,"I haven't been so excited about a CD in a long, long time! This CD is truly inspirational and full of energy! I am a new listener to PCD and I will be a longtime fan! This is great stuff!"
5,WELL WRITTEN,This was an interesting story. It helps you get to know her father more and see that he really cares about her. I thought that Mary Anne's grandmother was rude to keep putting him down to her and to criticize Mary Anne and make her upset. Mary Anne tells her off and runs out the door and hides in the cornfields. Then she comes back and says sorry. SORRY FOR WHAT? That part irritated me. It was her Grandma who needed to say sorry. It was her doing.
1,Hate Mary Anne!,"Mary Anne is a spoiled little witch, so I can't say I liked this book. It was dull, and all Mary Anne cared about was how good she looked in glasses she was so overwhelmed about the mother's day tea party (come on, Mary Anne, it's only a TEA party that happens once a year!) that she ended up with two guests! Geez."
5,Bread making,Product as advertized. Prompt shipment. Have consumed some wonderful bread products produced with this machine.
2,bread like lead,Two different loaves came out like lead.I found 2 potentially fatal errors in the recipe book - One missing water and the other calling for use of a non-existant cycle.I returned the machine
5,great product!,"I bought this bread machine after my old one finally broke and I must say I'm much happier with this machine than I ever was with my other one! The breadman not only bakes a loaf of up to two pounds, but it's easy to clean and program and every loaf I've baked in it has turned out perfect. It also comes with very easy to follow instructions and a really nice recipe book. I just made the cinnamon rolls today and they were to die for! With machines like this out there, I can't imagine why anyone would ever eat store bought bread or desserts again."
2,Designed to wear out quickly,"Although it works fine, this bread machine is underdesigned in the area of the bread pan and paddle.Specific problem areas:1) The seal at the bottom of the pan wears out.2) The paddle strips out.3) The machine walks around on the counter while kneading (I think this is a potential fire hazard, in addition to causing it to break if it falls off).Ours needed a new paddle and pan after one year, and about 100 loaves of bread.Cost for a new pan and paddle? About $60, including shipping and tax.In fairness to this machine, all of the other brands we've used (about 3) also had seal failures fairly quickly. However, the mixing shaft is smaller on the Breadman TR888, allowing the paddle to strip more easily.Only buy this if you don't seriously plan to use it."
4,"Good, all-purpose breadmaker","I recently replaced my old breadmaker with the TR888 Corner Bakery Breakmaker. What I like most about the new breadmaker is that the paddle never detaches itself while cooking or when the baked loaf is removed, although it is easy to detach for cleaning. The ingredients mix very thoroughly, with virtually no need to scrape the sides of the pan. The pan is also heavier than the pan in any previous machine I have owned, which makes for stability. It is easy to select and use all the various options. The whole grain cycle seems to take a little longer than with other bread machines, but my whole grain loaves have risen more evenly. I have had the breadmaker for about 4 weeks now and made more than a dozen loaves of bread. I am pleased with this selection. It's a good value. The only thing I don't like about it is that the breadcrust, even using the darker option, doesn't get even a little crusty. Perhaps, this is because the bread pan is heavier. It's very minor deficiency"
4,Great machine and excellent bread.,This is our 3rd bread maker over the last 10 years or so. We use it at least once a week and often more. It makes delicious bread every time. We only use recipes (or modify them) with at least 1/2 whole grain flour. I've used as much as 2/3 whole wheat and it still turns out great! We also use the bread maker for dough. It sure beats depending on the ambient weather to get your yeast doughs to rise and it only takes about an hour. Our last machine had little lights that told you what part of the process it was currently in and that would be a nice feature for this model...but only for my own curiosity. I would definitley buy it again...a great machine for a great price!
1,Big Disappointment,"I had high hopes for this bread machine as it showed lots of options and I had had Breadman brand bread machines in the past. It has been a complete disappointment. I have never had a bread machine (and I have had 4 so far) that was so temperamental. If the ingredients aren't all room temperature, the bread won't come out right. Since I keep my flour in the refrigerator, this means I actually have to warm up the flour before I can use it in the machine. Despite this, at least half the loaves come out of the machine a failure-they either don't rise or they collapse towards the end. I've had the machine about 1 1/2 years now and am finally giving up and buying a new machine because this one will no longer mix in ingredients when the beep occurs. I wouldn't waste my money on this machine. Lots of options are useless when they don't work!"
4,Good dough maker,I've used this machine for more than a year and works good. The breads do come out good; I primarily use it as a dough making machine as I prefer to control the raising and baking manually. Would recommend.
2,Stay away!,"This product kneads just fine (if somewhat long), but can't bake properly. Bread finishes undone and cake is burnt. Changing the settings doesn't help either. I would definitely stay away from this choice if you are looking for a good bread machine."
1,"It did great at first, but...","Well, I was very impressed with this machine when I first got it... Three days ago. Only, I am now having to take it back to the store because the motor is straining and it can't knead the bread anymore. I am really sad at having to take it back. We made two loaves of bread and one cake in the machine before it broke down. I will admit that I have not decided if I'm going to replace it with the same model or not. I will admit that the recipe book and the user manual was very simple to follow. I just wish that it had lasted longer. All I know is that it did manage to completely hook me on fresh baked bread. I'm definitely going to get another bread machine."
4,Love it,I am very happy with my bread maker. It is easy to clean and every loaf comes out great. I have not owned a bread maker before but I can't imagine another one out-performing this one. I highly recommend it.
4,Wonderful for making dough!,"I actually didn't purchase this bread machine, I received mine for free through a Freecycle group. So obviously, my model came to me used and was actually a bit banged up. It's lid is no longer attached, and it looked like it spent some time on the counter being ignored. But it works and that was key. But let me tell you about how it performs and how I use mine.I don't like the way the bread baked in a bread machine comes out so I only use it to make dough (or butter if I'm feeling fancy). I use mine several times a week. It's getting a ton of use out and considering I've had it for about a year and a half, it's doing a bang up job.Will I buy another bread machine? Probably not since it takes a ton of space up on my extremely limited counter space and I can probably do exactly the same thing with a mixer which I can then use for other cooking projects. But if I were going to purchase a bread machine, I'd get another one of these. This model has impressed me."
4,quality product,This bread machine is a real quality product. I have used it several times and it performs really well.
2,Not worth the price,"I have now had two of these machines in two years. I make 8-10 loaves of dough a week. Though the bread tastes fine, it is too costly to replace this machine every year. My last machine's kneading pin started hitting the side of the pan because the pan pin wore out. To replace the pan it would cost $43 (including shipping). You could buy a Sunbeam machine for less than that.In the end, this machine just doesn't hold up under regular use. If you have a good dough recipe it really doesn't matter what machine you have. Go for less expensive."
2,"""odd and nonsensical--more for younger readers?""","I understand there are a lot of political jabs and innuendos in this book. Perhaps they were applicable when this book was written. To me this book was silly. I'd prefer to listen to ""Jefferson Airplanes"" version...White Rabbit, or the question in ""Matrix""...how far does the rabbit hole go? For a young kid, this book may prove to be quite a trip."
4,Great compilation of delightful music!,Grandes Exitos is a great compilation of some of the best songs of Jarabe de Palo. I highly recommend the CD to anybody who is a great fan of good music. Great for in the car!
5,Excellent Quality.,"The quality of the build is impressive and has worked well so far. Overall I'm very satisfied,"
3,Dunlop dual chipper,"Chipper is well built and of very good quality. My overall opinion on it's use is not as good, as I find the club difficult to get use to."
1,"Oh, no, not yet another generation being exposed to these !","When I first had these readers assigned to me in 1953 they were the most boring books I ever read or have read thereafter. ""Mother"" stays home and wears dresses. ""Father' goes to work. In 1953 I don't remember many families like that, and for sure today's children are not being reared in that style. I cannot imagine how awful and strange these books must seem to children who now have instant information accessible to them via computers and the Internet. To compare then and now, nowadays children are often (not all school districts) expected to be able to read before they start kindergarten. Back then, when we started kindergarten we were taught to count from one to ten and learn ""to say our ABC's"". I was very disappointed to see these books are still around! Go, Go, Go, Run, Run, Run, Vomit, Vomit, Vomit! And to all of you who also gave them one star, Clap, Clap, Clap! You are wise people."
5,Dick and Jane,"My son is [...]is reading this book my himself. The book uses repeats the words many times which is how he learned them. Once he learned the sounds of each letter, the book uses words that are easy to sound out. The stories are cute and he can relate to them because they are simple and humorous."
2,"ordered two books, only got 1","well, i have been waiting for 2 months and feel ripped off. I have not recieved my other book that I ordered with it. beware!!"
4,Great to help kids read,My granddaughter learned to read this book very quickly at 5 years old. Some things never grow old. Great for kids learning to read
5,Perfect for a New Reader!,"With the repetitious way these books are written, it's no wonder they are classic. My son is in Kindergarten and after the first night of reading them, he was hooked. He loves the accomplishment of actually ""reading"". They belong in every home library and back in schools!"
4,Works but could be better,"I own a 99 Honda Accord Ex (4door) and the way it goes on is with an adhesive strip thats already on the back of the plastic. While i havent tried to take it off it does allow me to open my windows just enough to get some fresh air while driving without worrying about rain coming in. think i paid either 40 or 50 here on amazon, so i guess alright for the price, i think 30-35 would be more than enough."
3,Track listing is confusing.,"Pros of The Complete History CD are Great & memorable songs by the 1990's dance duo, 2 Unlimited. The cons are that the track listing for this CD is misleading. Being displayed is 20 tracks. Actually, there are only 16 tracks. Track 15 is actually a medley of 5 of their songs. Track listing itemizes those particular 5 songs and lists individually as tracks 15-19.I was very disappointed that I spent $21.00 on what I thought was 20 tracks which turns out to be only 16 tracks."
5,Randomly picked up..but wow it was good,"Ok, I randomly picked this book up at the library...and when i saw it and read the synopsis i said oh well. I took it home and the first few pages bored me a bit..but then...Man the Vixen in this book was sooo baddd! She literally made me mad and i had to put the book down with some of the stuff that she did to these ppl in this book. GREAT BOOK1"
4,What is this? (Skeptical),"what is this story? Supernatural? suspense? Is it horror, fantasy? about a love story or Humor? I can't decide. I'm still reading, about half way done. So far, so good, stays kinda funny. Whatever it is, I kinda like it."
1,The worst ever,"Yep, it's cheap. But you don't get what you pay for. The slightest bump will send your bottles crashing to the floor because it's insufficiently deep to securely hold any bottle I've tried. It's the very definition of ""flimsy"" and worse than ""cheap"". Thankfully, I figured that out when I placed the first bottle into this abysmally conceived contraption and grabbed the bottle before it was too late. Hey, maybe it would work for you. But I don't buy without a rating of 89 or better -- and I buy only one until I've sampled (you know, I don't always agree with the critics); if the good rating's deserved, I buy as much as I can afford. At that point, every bottle becomes a treasure, and I won't risk a single one. I've supplemented storage with several 44-bottle, unfinished pine racks (also available on Amazon) that are too snug for sparkling wines (alas) but inspire confidence for about anything else (especially when linked to a safety wire anchored to the wall)."
2,Lousy,"I do not reccommend this product. It is sitting against the wall in my garage. Instructions were a joke, does not hold the bottles evenly, and a pain in the neck to set up. I've ordered a different one that looks like tinker toys goes together simply and is cutomizable to the shape of the space."
5,A TRUE BLESSING!,"THIS WONDERFUL WORK OF ART BY MORT CRIM IS A GODSEND! I HAVE NEVER LISTEND TO SUCH COMFORTING, AND INSPIRING WORDS OF WISDOM, I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HEARING THE TAPES. MORT IS LIKE A GOOD FRIEND WHEN YOU NEED IT. I HAD TO BUY A SECOND COPY TO HAVE FOR FRIENDS.HEARING MORT'S ESSAY'S IS LIKE THE PERFECT PRESCIPTION ANY DOCTOR CAN ORDER!"
4,love this rack,"This rack fits in my All-Clad 'lasagna pan', which is actually and smaller and MUCH less expensive version, of the full-sized All-Clad roasting pan. This rack is easy to clean and holds a large chicken, capon, or small turkey with ease. Even though I only use it once a year, during the Winter holiday's, it's worth every penny."
1,simply doesn't work properly,"I have never used a printer that is as worthless as this one. It simply doesn't work! No matter what type of paper I put in it, it pulls multiple pages through -- sometimes 3 or 4 at a time. Also, the first black ink cartridge ran out after very few pages were printed. (Unfortunately, it usually takes multiple tries to print a page so you wind up wasting both paper and ink.) HP products are usually outstanding. So I guess I recommend don't go cheap -- buy a high-end inkjet or laser printer, because you'll just end up throwing this one in the trash."
2,Beware,"I bought this oven for my children. After I lugged it home, my wife, an aspiring novelist, told me that ""It was a quear, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York."" I said ""Don't you like the kid's new stove?"" She replied, ""How frail the human heart must be - a mirrored pool of thought. ""I left it at that, and cooked some macaroni and cheese for dinner, after a good cigar and a glass of Weller's, I came back into the kitchen, only to discover....well, that's a long story, I just hope you realize this ain't no kids stove, it's the real deal, bud. Chance rules every corner of the universe except the chambers of the human heart."
5,Beautiful film,I didn't buy this DVD but I saw the film. It's worth the price: Many clips from films and surprisingly many home movies of Sonja. Touching ending.
4,Cover flow not so hot......All else is excellent,"Just upgraded from a 4G Ipod, so the difference in features is amazing. The menus are well organized and very intuitive.When using coverflow, the Ipod has a tendency to freeze for a couple of seconds while changing menus or even playing the selected soundtrack. Personally I don't see much use for the coverflow, specially when you have over 50Gigs of music. When you are NOT using coverflow, the Ipod runs like usual.Coverflow is nice to look at, but its more practical just to search for music by genre, artist, etc."
5,Good for all your music,"I love the product. I am slowly putting all my music on it and with 80 Gbps that will take some time. The quality is great which, as an Apple product, is to be expected."
4,Not as good as my 60GB,I love iPods. The 160GB turned out to have issues that my older 60GB didn't. First is it is much slower. Second is that twice now it has lost my place on an Audio book.On the positive side I like the menu system better and I have become addicted to Vortex (game).I had a 5th gen and the hard disk quit after 3 years of constant use.Overall I would buy it again but I wish it was a little faster in navigation.
2,Read the fine PRINT,"Do not buy the iPod Classic!! While this iPod offers the basic benefits of the iPod family, Apple has made one, Microsoft-worthy, change. The only component cables that will work (especially the video/AV/component cables) are the $50 (or more) Apple brand cables. They have inserted an ""authentication chip"" requirement into the firmware.If you notice, the 5th and 5.5 generation iPods (not the newest 6th gen. Classic) are more expensive for a reason: They're LESS RESTRICTIVE. After-market cables (such as Belkin/Griffin/Etc) will not allow video output from the Classic to TVs.If Apple introduces a firmware change to allow ALL video cables to be used, then you should consider this one...otherwise, stay with the 5th/5.5 generation units."
5,satisfied customer,My daughter was surprised with this gift for Christmas.She is very happy. no complaints. thanks
2,"IPod Good, ITunes Bad.","Everybody loves their IPod. What's not to like about carrying most of your favorite songs on the road with you, right? The unfortunate thing about the Ipod is it's controlled by ITunes software, a program with more bugs than a Beta Microsoft program. There are a million annoying things about this software, but the most annoying of all is that if something goes wrong (after the first 90 days from your purchase) you will find very little support. Apple will provide stock questions for support issues, but makes contacting them regarding specifics extremely difficult. Unfortunately, once iTunes is screwed up you have your choice of never loading a new song on your Ipod again or wiping your hard drive clean. I'm hoping some day there will be a high end MP3 player you can load from Windows, but it looks like I'm in for a long wait."
4,My new 160 Gig iPod,My first ever iPod works very well. Nice to have your entire music library on it as well as podcasts and some videos.
4,Freeze!!,Product tends to freeze up frequently. Other than that it has a lot of cool small improvements over the previous one.
3,The SLUGGISH new IPOD CLASSIC,"The new Ipod Classic 80 GB is sluggish and the click wheel sensitivity has just deteriorated compared to the previous Ipod Models. I own several IPOD's starting with the 2nd generation and frankly the SLUGGISHNESS to user controls and the WEIGHT of the new 80GB classic is quite a disappointment.Apple packs less in the package, first the dock disappeared , then the CD and now the sleeve has disappeared.All you get that matters is the IPOD and a USB connector cable.The output volume is more powerful and the battery appears to to have less work to do , so will last longer.My Ipod touch arrives next week and I hope that will give me more joy than the classic !"
3,Why does Apple send you a white headphone for a black IPOD,"Please enlighten me.I recently bought an Black IPOD and received one with a white earpiece and white charger. I called Apple to return it and get a White IPOD but they want to charge me a 10% restocking fee. Wish I had bought it from Amazon instead. Do not buy from the Apple store, they will charge you a restocking fee if return it for any reason.Daniel"
2,ipod 60gb classic 6 gen,i liked my gen 5 60 gb but the 6 gen was very dissappointing. i sent it back to amazon today after one month. the click wheel did not work well. it would not not off. many other small bugs. i'm amazed apple let this one out of the factory as is. i wish i could trade it for my old one but all anybody has is 6 gen. i might switch to an archos like i bought my son for xmas. it's too bad apple turned such a nice device into poo.
4,"No complaints whatsoever. Great product that delivers without fuss. Has had this since 2007, if the battery does eventually ...","No complaints whatsoever on this little baby except that with newer releases this is clunky by comparison - but really it's not.A GREAT product WITH NO ISSUES - DELIVERS without fuss.Great battery power - days of listening on a quick charge.I have had this since 2007, and it is my music repertory backup - if the battery does eventually wear out - I still have a hard drive for storage.Meanwhile it's still going good...and I still use it despite having added an iPhone, iPad to my list of toys.If you haven't already got any of the iPs, then this is a good purchase for you.If you are just after storage, there are cheaper HDs.Later releases are slimmer and sleeker but for the price, this is hard to beat for the storage you get.Consider a Nano for a lower outlay.Minus 1 star only because it's ""old"" & a little dated (but you shouldn't let that worry you). Otherwise a perfect 5."
5,Works for me,Ive been having some ipod issues and i needed another one for transition. I don't have any issues with this one. It arrived promptly and in good shape. This now gives me 3 ipods. One for the bedroom. One for the basement/mancave and one for the charger/garage and backyard. I'm a music adict and love my music all the time. This 80gb has plenty of room for me. I've bought ipods on ebay but Amazon was resonable and i did not have to haggle. thanks
5,Perfect for a music lover,This is the classic. If you are not up and well with new technology like touch screen and you dont feel like spending your time fiddling with the apps this is the ipod for you its a basic touch wheel design and holds a ton of music. It may not be the top of the line but if you intend to use it to listen to music and carry it with you everywhere this is the ipod for you
