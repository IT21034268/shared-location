4,: ),"great story! the characters had great, rich personalities. the only problem with this book was the way it was told. ""but dear reader."" just get on with the story already! other than that, it was a great story that's too good to forget."
4,movie better for kids,This book is interesting but the under 12 set is better off watching the movie . It is really dark.
5,"Okay, we've got the princess, we've got the hero.....","You know more advanced readers can enjoy this book too, even though there is a bit too much whimsy in the first couple of chapters. I'd say that I am a pretty advanced reader, I read more than 300 books last school year, and read the Lord Of The Rings when I was eight and I would say that this is an excellent book. This book is about a mose with large ears, and some human-like tendencies: He likes to read books instead of chew on them, and he loves music and states, in the book, that it ""...[S]ounds like honey..."", which all the other mice are worried about. One day he follows the music and finds a princess named Pea [laughs] who he immediately falls in love with. Now meanwhile, we have this evil rat who wants to kill the princess [for reasons that I won't give away] and his means to do so are an abused kitchen girl named Miggery Sow.This book is a must-read for any lover of fantasy.Adieu!"
4,Tales of Despereaux,I think this book is an excelent book. It keeps the reader reading. I also think it is really cool how they keep changing point of view and perspective. I think anyone who wants to read a good fiction book should read this book.
4,A True Knight in Shining Armour Story,The Tale of Despereax was a skillfully written book of a young mouse who is determined to set out onto a quest to save a princess from the clutches of a manical rat and an easily fooled girl. This young mouse faced dozens of hurdles he had to face and overcome in order to save the young and beautiful Princess Pea. What is truly facinating about this book is that it not only focuses on one character but goes through the eyes of several characters to show their desires and gives you a better perspective of this timeless novel.
5,"awsome, best book i've ever read",Read this book if you like fantisy and very interesting books. You'll never want to stop reading this magnifacent fairy tail. Full of action stringe love and a heart as big as this little mouses ears. (wich are huge)
5,Once Upon A Time,"This is a great tale to add to the collection. It is a story with a mouse, Despereaux, who is an unlikely hero. He is unwanted and thought to be strange because he loved music, books, and especially the princess. When he is sent to the dungeon because he fails to act like a mouse, the real plot begins. With characters like a rat who likes light and a servant girl who foolishly thinks she can be a princess, the story forms and leads to a inventive climax and a warm ending."
3,A good book,This is a pretty good book. It's very well written - I just thought it was a little bit depressing even though it ends as well as it possibly can.
5,Good read for any age,I read this book after seeing the previews for the movie and enjoyed it very much. Great book for any age.
3,The Tale of Despereaux Review,"The Tale of Despereaux is a great book for younger children. It is about a mouse; who's very different compared to all the other mice. Despereaux is a courageous mouse, who falls in love with a princess named Pea. When the princess gets captured by a rat named Chiaroscuro (Roscuro for short) it's up to Despereaux to save her.This book wasn't that exciting to me. I need my books to be realistic, which gets me going and getting into the book. This is why I recommend this book to younger viewers. The book has a very unique way in getting a person into the book. After every chapter the author asks you some questions which I thought was nice. The Tale of Despereaux isn't one of my favorite books, but it is one I will remember."
5,The Adventure of a Mouse,"The Tale of Despereaux is about a mouse named Despereaux who finds true love with the Princess Pea. It's also about a rat named Chiaroscuro who is the only rat to sees the light and who wants to plot his revenge on the princess pea. The princess gave him a foul look which made him go back to the dungeon. And Miggery sow who was sold by her father for a hand full of cigarettes, a red table cloth, and a hen. She becomes a slave to the man she was sold to.The author, Kate DiCamillo, talks to you in a way that it feels like she's right next to you. The story takes place in the kingdom of Dor.The main events are Despereaux finds his true love, Roscuro kills the queen and Miggery Sow becomes Roscuros partner.Despereaux does things the way he wants whenever he wants no mater what mice say. And what Kate DiCamillo is saying is that you can think for yourself and life is always an adventure.By Miles"
1,If I could use a ) star I would,"This is a horrible story: abuse, powerless/stupid/fat/beaten up young girl. What else could happen to this young girl. I read this story to my girls, the first few chapter and decided to go further on my own just to make sure the story would take a ""lighter"" turn.It didn't it went from ok to worse. No wonderful role model here for young girls.Very sad and disturbing story."
1,Unsuitable for Children of any age!! Violent and Sadistic,"Like the other reviewer who gave this story one star, I received the book for my 8 year old son as a gift from his grandmother. Yes, the book is creative, enchanting and very well written. But absolutely NOT! suitable for children. The story opens with the depiction of still born babies, infant rejection, continues with excommunication for the idolisation of unattainable love, includes capital punishment and covers a lengthy paragraph on the fine points of torture, including the art of befriending and then betraying someone so as to amplify the effect of torture. As an adult, the story is interesting. But for a child, no-way. In my opinion, these themes don't belong in our children's culture."
4,The Tale of Despereaux,"I received the book in a timely manner. It was an older book, but I knew I was purchasing it used."
4,Da Review...,"The main character of `THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX' is a very knowledge and brave mouse. He read books all the time... Most of his books are about love. The involved `Sleeping Beauty', Cinderella'... etc. all books about Prince and Princess.This book takes place in a huge castle in the middle of a beautiful forest, where the King's family lives. A mouse falls in to a LOVE with the princess Pea. One day he gets to talk to her, and touch it. Unfortunately the law in the mouse world is if you talk to a human, you have to go to the `DUNGEON' where all the scary mice are living. So he had to go there. Will he survive? How? Well you well found out in the book.This book gives a new vision for kids. It shows us how to understand bullying, and I love the character."
5,A Great Book,I read this book in my Literature Circle at school and I liked it a lot! It's about a mouse named Despereaux that gets sentenced to the dungeon by his own brother and father for breaking important mouse rules. He escapes the dungeon only to return to it to save Princess Pea. I won't ruin the story. You'll have to read it to find out more.
4,It was pretty good,"This book was a neat story. The author gave you a small description whenever she used a large word. It had a great begining, a verry exciting middle but the ending was only 4 pages long. I reccomend this book for grade three ang up."
5,entrancing tale,"I used this book as a read aloud with my 7 year daughter. Former high school English teacher, now home school mom, I thought this was one of the best books of children's literature we've encountered yet. (Also loved Because of Winn Dixie.) From the first chapter we were captivated by the characters, the brilliantly descriptive narrative drew us into the story, and the illustrations captured the mood of the story perfectly. Because of the short chapters, we were able to read alot or a little depending on what was happening that day. My daughter loved the story so much she kept asking her friends over to listen with her. A story of love, hope, faithfulness to ones-self, and good overcoming evil."
3,trying to force feed wonder,"My child loves to be read to, and to read. We have gone through contemporary books and classics, Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan, The Cricket in Times Square. We have read a lot of books. Usually they have good dialogue and characters with relationships based on lively experiences.This book was not usual. It felt like the author was unable to create character desciptions with any weight. It was really hard to keep going on reading this every night. It is the first time we have felt this way about a chapter book.It is okay, not horrible. I just can't figure out why it won a medal. Children don't need to be told feel wonder here. They just do, when a story is good."
4,Charming Book,My children enjoyed having this book read to them. It was a great adventure & and we were all relieved that it had a happy ending. Most enjoyable.
3,A Lovely Little Book,"This was a great read-aloud book (we actually started listening to the audio version together in the car, but had to return it to the library). I would highly recommend the audio version - the narration was beautiful. So, we finished it together (my son and I) last night. I'm not sure he thought much of it, but it was a lovely little book. Not as much plot, or excitement, as I think he was expecting, but fun nevertheless. We're looking forward to seeing the movie this holiday!"
4,great book,"the book was exiting. It was about a mouse called Despereaux Tilling. And one time Furlough Despereaux brother took him for a walk in the castle. Despereaux sneaked out one night to go around the castle, and he saw a human. Tha human was the princess. the princess was with her dad the and the king was singing a song to princess so could to sleep. one second later the princess sees Despereaux. and that is when the adventures happen. its a great book for kids i recomend this book to kids that like adventures."
4,The Tale of not-so-disappointing,"Kate's books are always so refreshing, simple and well written. The tale of Despereaux is proof - although my favorite is The Magician's Elephant, this book was a great read. Very insightful with many wise words. Would highly recommend and read again!"
1,"Dark, sad, and disturbing.","I read this book long ago when it was first published, and can not believe it is being made into a movie!This book, simply put, is full of nothing but sadness, malice, violence (toward children, no less) and in my opinion is *inappropriate* for children.I will never understand how it won the Newberry, and wonder how much of the story will have to be changed to make the movie palateable. I imagine it's holiday release will put a dark cloud over more than one family's holiday festivities."
5,What a mouse story!,"Not only did I read the book, but I also asked for the movie for Christmas! I watched it the same night. I'm a children's author and write stores about mice. Of course, this is far better than I could ever have written. Great story!"
4,A Story About Adventure and Love,"The Tale of Despereaux first tells you about a mouse who was born with his eyes open. His mother named him Despereaux, which means disappointment. She named him Despereaux because he was the only mouse in his litter to survive birth. Despereaux is different from other mice; for instance he likes to read.Then you hear about Chairoscuro, a rat who, unusually, loves light. Last you hear about Miggery Sow, a young girl whose father sold her for a red tablecloth, a hen, and a hand full of cigarettes. All of those three characters are related to the Princess Pea. Despereaux is in love with her, Chairoscuro wants revenge on her, and Miggery wants to be her, and when Mig and Cairoscuro conspire to get what they both want, Despereaux must save her.I liked this book because I like when everything is connected. In this case it would be the characters. Although I liked the book I did not think it was exciting."
2,In the minority...hated it,"I will admit that I plan to reread this book. I first read it a couple years ago to see if it was something my kids would enjoy as a read-aloud book. It had received rave reviews so I was looking forward to it. I hated it and almost didn't finish it but did so because I kept holding out hope it would improve. It was truly dark (think WWII writings) and morbid and I found very little uplifting, humorous,etc. I read a bit to my one daughter (the most serious who has patience with most books) and she even lost interest quickly. Now I see they have made a movie of it and I was shocked! I thought what a depressing film. But I know everyone now seems to love it so I'll give it another shot and re-read it. But I guess I'd warn people to read a chapter online or in library before buying it, just to see if its what you expect in tone and style."
5,The Tale of Desperaux,"The Tale of Despereaux, by Kate Dicamillo, is a really good book.It's about a mouse that is in love with music, stories, and a princess named Pea. It's also about a rat named Roscuro who has never seen the light. Another character is Miggery Sow a girl who really wants to be a princess. She also is a maid to her dad, who hits her in the ear every time she says some thing stupid. This book is one of my favorite books.If you like short books, this is not a great book for you, but if you like long books, this is a great book for you. The genre is fantasy. I love this book because I love the author Kate DiCamillo. I like that usually her books are about animals and their tragedies. The reading level is third grade and up. If you like this book, you should try The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane.by Sadie"
5,exceeds expectations,I bought this book for my 9 year old daughter last Christmas after she enjoyed reading Because of Winn-Dixie (also by Kate DiCamillo). We have been reading chapters every night and she and her little sister can't wait to hear what happens next. At dinner they start talking about the book. We haven't had this much fun reading aloud since Little House on the Prairie. This book is very well written and the short chapters keep the plot moving at a nice clip. There are new and challenging words (perfidy) for a young reader to look up but they are presented in a fun way. But more than anything the author has created a range of characters that all seem to evoke our empathy. She gives you insight into the motivatiobs behind despicable and incomprehensible acts. But it is still a fairy tale with an engaging underdog mouse hero.
3,I was too hard on this book originally,"I was unfair in my original review entitled ""dreadful"" so I am totally revising the review.I wouldn't recommend this book to people--I think there are many better children's books (the author's included) from which to choose--but it does pick up after the first ""book"" (i.e., section) which both my son and I found boring and shallow.As the narrator might say, ""Beware, reader....."" The cruelties described in the book make it unsuitable for kids under 10."
2,Hmmm...,"A great story, just poorly written. Because they switch characters frequently, it is harder to understand the story. Very dreary and makes you feel ugh, not in a good way."
4,"The Tale of a Small Mouse, And a Beautiful Princess Pea","Do you think that a small mouse could live happily ever after with a princess who is ahuman? In The Tale of Desperaux by Kate Dicamillo it`s possible. In the story a smalllittle mouse with huge ears named Desperaux falls in love with the beautiful Princess Pea. Since his ears are too big and he was born with his eyes open (which is not normal for a mouse), he has to go to the dungeon because the mouse council does not approve of that. While he is there, he meets a man named Gregory. Gregory tells him many stories, including the story about ""Miggery Sow"", a slave girl. She is trying to become princess by killing the Princess Pea. Miggery Sow teams up with the evil rat Roscuro. I recommend this book to readers of any age, because it is a real page turner. Will Miggery Sows evil plan work? Will Desperaux and the Princess Pea live happily ever after? To find out, you have to read the book."
2,Very dark book - not really for kids.,"I just finished reading this aloud to my [...]son. He enjoyed the book but I was troubled by the deeply disturbing parts of the story. A servant girl is beaten so often her ears turn to cauliflowers. They visit a dungeon that smells of blood and despair. A mouse family sends their son to his death because he doesn't fit in. There is very little redeeming about many of the characters. Had I known, I wouldn't have chosen this to read. We liked Winn Dixie very much but wished we'd skipped this one."
4,The Tale of Desperaux,"This book is about a mouse. When he is born all of his brothers and sister die. He is named Desperaux because he is a disapointment. He has huge ears and a tiny body. He hears music, and falls in love with a princess and he is thrown in a dungeon. He meets a rat named Roscuro and a prisoner named Gregory. They sneak onto a tray and get out of the dungeon. They meet a serving girl named Mig. Mig helps Roscuro kidnap the princess and.... read more to find out!!I give this book 4 stars. In the beginning when it first goes back in time it's really confusing. Everytime when it goes back it's confusing. I recommend this book to 6th graders and up, because it's confusing, but still a good book. If you are a person that likes suspense, this is a good book for you. It is just a very good book."
1,Very dark,"This is a terrible, terrible book. It is very dark and filled with characters who are abusive and abused, lonely, sad, violent, and depressed. I read the entire novel because I wanted to have faith in it and wanted to believe that it would get better. It didn't. The subsequent animated film was no better. I read it out loud to my 7-year-old. He liked it alright, but didn't get excited about it. I'm sort of sorry I read it to him, given how dark and negative it is. Think twice about this one."
5,Soup for everyone!,"Kate DeCamillo write such wonderful characters! Despereaux, Chiaroscuro, miggery Sow-- all fabulous, even if they happen to be villains. the fact that DiCamillo gives each character's sad backstory makes all of them just that much more believable. What a great fairy tale! Soup for everyone!"
5,An Amazing Adventure Anyone Can Love,"This is one of my favorite books of all time! It's a beautiful story. The plot and characters are amazing! You feel like the author is really talking to you. She tells you things and you know she is because she says ""Dear reader"" when telling you something. At one point in the story she tells you to look a word up in the dictionary because she knows you might not know what it means. Desperaux lives in a castle with a beautiful princess who he soon falls in love with. He is a strange little mouse. Infact, he was born with his eyes open. He can read also. He meets different people there in the castle: a servant girl who is jealous of the princess, was sold by her own father and beaten; and there are plenty of others. If you like this book, you would also enjoy ""The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane""."
1,A Kid's Review,"I really did not like this book very much because I don't like to read about people dying. It was also hard to tell sometime what was a dream in the book and what was really a part of the story. I think it was confusing to read sometimes. I liked the characters of Despereaux and Princess Pea. I also like reading about Miggery Sow when she was little, but I didn't like her when she got older."
1,Newbery winner?!,I could not finish reading this book- it was terrible. I felt like I was being condescended to and that the author had used every cheap cliche when writing it. I am stunned that this won the Newbery Medal.
1,Don't take a child to the movie!,"The book is OK, and the movie is OK (not great) but there is a trailer for a film called Coraline about a girl who is asked to sew buttons on her eyes, it is a dark horror tale and my kids are having nightmares. Despereaux is G, there is no wa Coraline can get a G. Either go late, or make sure your kids don't see the Coraline preview - if they do you will regret it."
1,I did not like this book but my daughter did,"I found this book to be rather stupid and a pathetic story to boot. First of all, who would name a princess Pea? But, more to the point, the story includes a girl who is sold by her father and then beaten up by her owner. Why is that a good plot line for a childrens' book? My nine-year-old daughter liked it however. I thought some of the plot twists and turns odd like the jailer and the dungeon he works in. And the Miggery Sow character sad, and not at all sympathetic. I liked the little mouse, however. I just did not like it. I don't know why kids do."
1,Oh please!!,"I read this book, because I was really bored, and it was in that car. (We where going to Main, and my little brother was reading it). A mouse who can read, and falls in love with a princess named Pea? Come on!!!! I really can't read books like that. It was annoyingly ""happy"", ""silly"", and ""fun"". Then again it may just be me. If you have read any of my other reviews then you will see that I mostly read dark fantasy. Little talking mice, outlawed soup, and killer rats simply don't appeal to me. Then agin the suggested reading age is 6- 12, so that could also be it. Ok I'll stop now before I make anyone mad. Sorry but I just really didn't like this book."
4,not just for children,"I discovered this book in a class that I was substitute teaching for. I was intrigued by the title and it was very easy to read. I read the book in about 4 days in between everyday responsibilities. This is not your typical children's book and that is what I liked about it. Politics, the threat of the ""rats,"" compassion, villainy, and doing what is right are all part of this book. You won't be disappointed when reading this book. This would be great for second grade and above."
4,The tales of Despereaux,"This is a very fun and exciting story that I think its appropirate for almost all ages. It has alot of suprises and hasnot all happy moments and some arent even expected. While the book made like a old fairy tale themovie was very cute and friendly and was kind of differnt from the movie, expeccial the illustrations of the book VSthe movie. I love how Despereaux only likes to do things HIS way and not really scared of things like the others are.Even though he is so small and he looked a little differnt, he didnt let his differences get in the way of anything."
4,Entering a World of Fantasy,"The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo is such a charming story that takes readers to an enchanting world. The use of illustrations in a novel entice readers and really bring the story to life.Despereaux is a mouse who against the odds survives and possess the talents of being able to read and hear things that no one else can hear. Once upon a time, Despereaux meets a king by the name of King Philip and his daughter, Princess Pea. Despereaux is lured by the king's music he plays for his daughter and soon enough, he finds himself talking to the princess and falling in love with her as well! The story takes a twist when Despereaux's brother does not approve of the relationship between a mouse and a human.This fantasy novel draws readers into it's magical world! It really draws in readers and allows them to practice their imagination."
4,Are You A Man or A Mouse?,"This is a modern fantasy book that hits on the timeless themes of good over evil, love conquers all, courage overcoming fear, and self-sacrifice. The narration is quite engaging and draws the reader into the story. I suspect that in the tradition of book to movie projects, the movie can not do justice to the book. This is book is suitable for all ages, whether as a read aloud for younger children or as a book to curl up with on some lazy afternoon. Jack gives this book two arms and two legs waving in the air."
3,great book but kindle version . . .,"love the book. unfortunately, the kindle version has titles to chapters that aren't well done and don't look good. they are blocky graphics. a minor issue. the pictures don't look great either. my hope though is that the publisher will read this review and correct as every part of the reading experience should be enjoyable"
5,"A Modest Mouse, falling is love with a princess","This book is a thrilling novel made for those who would crie for someone to be back in your lifeYou will love this book as much as I do and you will bring it everywhere you go !If you've read this book before, then you know you'll want to read it again, and again.this book is about a moouse that falls in love with music and a princess. He also has to save her ,and himself ..."
4,A Toching Book,"I thing it is a very nice ,sad, toching , and easy to read book for ages 6 or 7 and up.But there are some hard words. Other than that, the book rocks. I can read one book in one night. Children would love to read this book.P.S. There are some scary pars."
5,funny and romantic,"The Tale Of Desepeaux is a very, very funny and romantic story!!!!!!!!!!!! I think it is a five star book(*****), and should be a best seller book. I also say in a way it is a kid's book. In this book my favorite character is Desepeaux. It also should be a classic."
2,Nothing happens,The Newberry win is kind of mysterious for this book. My kids and I (all enthusiastic readers) agree that nothing ever really happens in it. It's rather short and empty. Surely there were more deserving books that year.
2,Disappointing,"I was not enthused about this book- I found it's story line rather bare, the characters were never fleshed out and the story itself too disjointed and pointless. I read all of my children's books first for quality so I'm no stranger to children's books. I cannot figure out how this book won an award."
4,A students review of Tale of Despereaux,"Do you know what happens when a mouse falls in love? Well, this little mouse named Despereaux (Des-per-roe) gets into some troubles! Despereaux is a sweet little mouse, born with big ears. One day, he finds the king of the kingdom he lives in singing to the beautiful princess of the kingdom. Well, the number one rule for these mice is to never let humans see you! Still, Despereaux went closer and closer to the princess. Well, the princess saw Despereaux and picked him up! Soon his brother sees him. Uh-oh! Now Despereaux is in trouble!Follow this mouse on his great adventures by reading this fantasy\adventure book! In my opinion this is a great book to snuggle up with by a warm fireplace! If you want to read a great adventure and love story, pick up The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo. By Sophie"
4,A clever and sweet story,"I really enjoyed this book, it's cute, clever and sweet and the pictures are absolutely ADORABLE. I can really see why it got a Newbery Award. I liked the end and the beginnig the best. I didn't really enjoy the part about the girl, I forget her name. That's why this book gets 4 stars and not 5. The part about Desperaux was so sweet. I loved it. I also think this is not only a story for girls, because I think boys might like the part about the rat."
4,radent,''You have to read The Tale of Despereaux'' it is full of saddness and dreams. It is a book that will knock your head off.
3,"Spooky, good story",I bought this book for myself (44) just to see what the literature for teen children is today like. I have to say that I've read it in one gulp but found myself few times quite scared and maybe even disgusted - I am talking about poor sold Mig and the clouts and spooky Gregory in the dungeon full of desperate people and rats. Probably the morbid pictures made their portion but I am sure I would be terrified in my 10 or 12.The story itself is nicely built and told with only two weaker points - the motivation of Roscuro to kill the princess and then the final scene with the needled mouse was quite quick and not that pointed I would expect. So all in all it is a nice story for adults but I doubt I would have enjoyed it in my childhood.
4,Disappointed in Rhode Island,"I read this book before it was given the Newbery Award and was surprised when it won. Two things bothered me about the book. One was the ""Dear Reader"" device;as an adult reader I thought it was condescending. Maybe it won't bother children. The secondthing was the cruelty alluded to by the reviewer from Long Beach CA, the treatment of the girl who was beaten and boxed on the ears till she was deaf. This detracted from a charming story of love and courage and might have a detrimental effect on sensitive readers. I thought it was unnessesary to the plot. I loved the author's first book ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" but the ending of her second book ""Tiger Rising "" also disturbed me."
1,"Do not buy, do not bother with... not literature","Honestly a terribly written book. Those who think otherwise need to go back and look at Trumpet of the Swan or Charlotte's Web, just for a start. It is needlessly and endlessly repetitive (""the light, the light!"" ugh, no need to bash children over the head), boring, dark, unimaginative, nonsensically cruel, and insulting to the intelligence (""now, reader, this is important:""). I'm astounded that this won a medal. There are much better investments of time and money, and no, I certainly DON'T mean Harry Potter."
1,Lame plot and turgid prose,"I had to make a first review here in protest at such junk packaged as high-brow kids lit. The dark content is off-putting, but all the more so because it comes with an exceedingly poor plot & is written in an achingly moronic style. Honestly, I think the book adaptations of straight to dvd barbie movies exhibit better literary flair. I'll reprint here another reviewers thoughts that echo my own...Honestly a terribly written book. Those who think otherwise need to go back and look at Trumpet of the Swan or Charlotte's Web, just for a start. It is needlessly and endlessly repetitive (""the light, the light!"" ugh, no need to bash children over the head), boring, dark, unimaginative, nonsensically cruel, and insulting to the intelligence (""now, reader, this is important:""). I'm astounded that this won a medal. There are much better investments of time and money, and no, I certainly DON'T mean Harry Potter."
1,"awful, reader, just plain awful","Please do not read this book, reader!!! Reader, I had just finished reading Because of Winn-Dixie, and I found it to be a wonderful book and story. But, reader, Tale of Despereaux did not come anywhere close to what I expected a good, or worthy of reading children's book, should be. I also, reader, feel that anyone who has to tell a child what is going on without letting them think for themselves or create their own meanings should not bebale to get their books published. I have always felt the point of getting children to read is to, get them to read! Then the stories and meanings can be discussed later. Children always bring something new the table, and this book ruins a childs creative and imaginative mind."
1,An Awful Book!,"I HATE this book! It has a terrible story line that doesn't make any sense. It is a crazy book. And parts of it are very, very strange. When I first heard about it I thought that Despereaux falls in love with Princess Pea(what kind of name is THAT?) and some fairy or magic turns him into a prince or something like that. Instead we get a strange and confusing story. I give Kate one thing though, she certainly has a big imagination. I wouldn't buy this book, EVER!, so make sure you get it from the library if you still want to read it. But believe me, I'm a reader, BIG time, and this is definitely a book you don't want to read. How this got an award is a mystery!"
4,Windsurfing,"This book does an adequate job of expaining the sport. The sport has changed since this book was copyrighted, though. Someone interested in pursuing the sport should not only get this book, but also there are are good video resources out there that can be reviewed as one progresses in the sport. The cost of these resources represent a tiny fraction of the money that will be spent on Windsurfing gear."
4,Good Reference,"This book has helped me with my windsurfing technique(or the lack there'of before I bought this book). I think that it is probably the next best thing next to a lesson, or ten. I would recommend it to anyone with a desire to windsurf, it helped me."
1,Revolting stuff,"Anyone interested in the revolting history of Christian anti-Semitism can find one of the founding documents here. I am amazed that two people posted reviews of this book and didn't even mention the truly disgusting language and images employed by this so-called ""Saint."" In fact, the latest edition of the works of the ""Fathers of the Church"" simply omits these homilies because they are so repellent."
4,Heavy duty rack and still looks nice after months on boat..,This is still a nice looking rod rack and it has been installed in our boat and used for months...
3,"It is OK, but the Division's history of the whole war is better.","This is an initial report that Draper wrote.The better final version of it is in the Division history of the Battle of Germany.Much is identical in the two versions, but the final version has more detail.It lacks the maps, and paintings by Sgt. Walter Chapman. I find the maps to be very important to understanding the small battles.It is very good in what it covers, the 84th's role in the Battle of the Bulge, but the 84th did so much more."
1,not worth the money,"while the dvd may be helpful to someone just starting, it glosses over material that just about any coach already knows or can easily obtain in more extensive (and much cheaper) formats including free on-line coaching forums. Coach K's drill DVD's are much more helpful."
5,Best little mixer in the world,This little mixer is great for all of those powders we mix into our drinks for better health. It is very powerful and durable. It travels well and even has it's own pouch for storing.
4,Good but wish you could control the speed.,"Bought this for mixing up chocolate milk for me, a 32 year old male adult. The reason however is I avoid all sugars and found some sugar free chocolate syrup but for the life of me couldn't get it to actually mix up with a spoon. Guess it's due to however they make the sugar free stuff.This thing sure did the trick but the first time using it I nearly made a unintended whipped cream topping in the process.It spins super fast and I really wish there was a way to have control over the mixing speed.But I've since learned to do short pulses in order to get it mixed to the level I desire without overdoing it."
4,Great little mixer.,"This portable hand held mixer does a great job mixing my protein drink every morning. Two AA batteries last a long time. This my second Fit and Fresh mixer. When you are finished using the mixer and rinse the mixer wand under a faucet, do not stand the mixer upright. If you do this water will run down the mixer wand and get in the electric motor and damage the bearing. This greatly shortens the life of the Fit and Fresh mixer."
2,no exactly satisfied,"This is not what I thought it was going to be. The product I purchased before, which is the same packaging, etc. had one plastic mixer and 1 steel mixer. The item I received is in different packaging entitled ""Fit & Fresh"" Portable Mixer and has 2 plastic wands, which will not properly mix the stuff I use."
3,Portable Drink Mixer,"I love the size and portability of the drink mixer. It's powerful for its size so works great for my 3Xday protein shake. My only complaint is that after several months of continuous use, the battery connections cease to work so it's a struggle to get the mixer to function. I've just decided that they are so inexpensive that I'll use them til they work no more, toss them, then use another one."
2,no power!,"i have been using these things for years. I typically have 3 or 4 of them in various locations to accommodate ""happy hour""; They also made nice christmas gifts. The quality of my last batch of these mixers was not that great and it was time to re-stock. I spent a lot of time trying to find ones that will hold up. I bought 3 of them a few weeks ago. One is dead,,,the other two are too weak to mix a drink w/ ice. They appear to be a bit sturdier than some of their competition,,but they skimped on the motor,,,not worth a damn! I'll be buying 4 more of the cheaper ones i guess and just planning on using them as almost disposable,,but at least they'll mix a drink."
5,Great stirrer,Have been using these for years to stir milk with Nestle's Quik in it. Order several as they only last a few months with daily use.
4,Great portable mixer,I love this portable hand mixer that is so compact and comes with handy case. It is easy to use and clean.
1,It worked ONE time,"I used this item ONE time. I went to use it a second time and it did not respond at all, I thought maybe it was the batteries so I changed them, but no, it is dead. One time use."
5,Good Product for a Good Price,I bought this one to replace one that had finally quit after 10 years of use. It arrived on time and in good shape. It works great for mixing up powered drinks.
3,Breaks easily,"I ordered this, and it broke within a week. We liked how it worked, so we returned it and got a new one. That one lasted two months, but it's now broken again. We use it to mix Carnation Instant Breakfast, and apparently that's too much for it to handle. The two stirrers that come with it are plastic, and the threads that hold it to the motor get quickly stripped."
1,never worked right,"This thing barely had any power from the first day. No matter how many times I switched to fresh batteries, it didn't have the power to mix up the simplest of things. I went back to a manual shaker. Would not buy a Vitaminder product again."
5,Best Little Mixer In Town!,"I have used this little portable mixer for years, and there's nothing like them, when you're on the go. Great for instant liquid meals."
1,This is a ToY! Apply the cost to a real handheld mixer.,"The Fit & Fresh handheld mixer has low power and doesn't work well, especially with protien drinks. It might make a great toy for children who want to ""help out"" in the kitchen. Please apply the cost of this mixer to a real handheld mixer rather than wasting it on this. Amazon does not return this Item. One must call the seller...Fit & Fresh Portable Drink Mixer"
1,Avoid this flawed product,This could be a handy little mixer if it were not for the fact that the switch plate inside is too close to the contact making the on-off switch nearly inoperable. Last night it just turned on by itself while no one was within 5 feet of it. Look around for a better model like the Norpro.
1,Worthless!,I was so anxious to receive this so I could make my protein drinks at work. It worked for all of 10 seconds and quit. Tried 3 fresh sets of batteries. No luck. It costs as much to return it as I paid for it. What a waste of money.
2,Not the best,"The IKEA milk frother is much better. This thing has removable blender parts, and so it cannot handle thick-er solutions. It tends to fly out of its socket and then you put it back, flies out again, etc.I don't really use it anymore since I got two frothers. It was a waste of money to get this one, but it was to arrive faster, and cheaper."
1,I've owned THREE---all were a piece of crap,"Got one thinking it would be handy to use when we travel. Used it at home as well, daily. Lasted about six months then just died. I tried a couple other BRANDS and one didn't work out of the box, the other's performane was sub par. So I figured, what the hell, I'll buy a couple more of these Fit and Fresh ones and just figure if they last 6 months I can live with that---I mean the price is certainly attractive, right. Well the second one worked with noticeably more power than the first one I owned several months prior. I was pleased. That lasted a total of about 5 minutes then the power fizzled to the point it wouldn't even stir your imagination; let alone protein powder into milk. So I tried the third. It's power sucked too.This thing is just too cheap to bother with. So don't."
4,Not too bad,This little mixer works rather well for its size. Easy to use and clean. Certainly not meant for any heavy-duty mixing but OK for protein drinks and hot chocolate.
2,Item only worked for 2 weeks,"The item is a great item and I purchased it to mix powdered formula for my granddaughter. The problem I have with it is that it only worked for a little over two weeks. I have tried new batteries and that is not the problem. I have not attempted to return this yet, but I had several from a number of years ago (different brand) and they are still working."
1,wow,dont go by what you read in the reviews. this thing feels like its meant as a toy for your daughters baby dolls!
2,Nice idea but too light in wind,I'm allergic to sun so am constantly looking for better working gear as I'm outdoors 90% of my days working as a farmer and restoration carpenter. This hat is a great concept but needs refining.Flap is too light so in the slightest wind blows up like your a Nun taking a vow. A flying Nun I'm not. The result is that your neck and temples get burned all to easily. The long bill is nice. Does not stand up to multiple washings. Would not buy again.
1,Popeil Pocket Fisherman performance issues,"The concept is great. Small foldable fishing rod. Ordered two for myself and my wife. My wifes reel worked sporadically after casting, and mine had a defect where the line came out of the handle, causing it to catch and hang up when casting. Too bad. Improved quality would make it a great idea."
5,"Finally, a fundraising book I didn't dread reading!","Kim Klein is an excellent writer. She knows fundraising, but better yet, she knows how to teach others about how to fundraise. I will definitely be reading more of her books, if not all of them!"
2,how they did it,"Green is thorough, but fundamentally limited by 1) his categories and 2) his critical judgment. The latter does not exist for canonical Christian texts. Paul conducted his mission as reported in Acts, etc. In fact, Pl's letters do not support the picture of Acts.Categories are those of modern evangelical theology. Not wicked, but not those of the first century/ argument therewith vitiated."
4,House 2,Great classic 80's B flick.Still holds the test of time. I enjoyed it as much as the first time I saw it. It's one of those movies you just forgot about.
3,Different Address...,"HOUSE 2 is much sillier, though far less frightening / funny than the original. This time we've got all new characters in a different house, trying to help a living dead cowboy (Royal Dano from Messiah Of Evil, and Killer Clowns From Outer Space) keep a mystical, crystal skull out of the gnarly hands of another (evil) cowboy zombie. The house itself is a portal to alternate realities w/ dinosaurs, monsters, and a cuddly dogger-pillar (!!). John Ratzenberger (Motel Hell, Pixar's entire catalogue) is Bill, the electrician / adventurer who inadvertantly opens a gate to another universe filled w/ angry aztecs! Bill is my favorite character, and is not in it long enough. Bill Maher also stars as an annoying record producer. HOUSE 2 isn't bad as long as you don't expect anything remotely resembling the first movie..."
3,not as good as the first,"this was a completely different story line to the first house. still good, but not as great as the original"
4,Good for beginners of horror,"I've seen this movie many times. I like it because it's funnier than the first, as the first is more macabre. And the cross between of a dog and caterpillar, one of the characters in the movie, is extremely cute."
4,You've got yourself an alternate universe in there.,"If you are looking for a scare, this movie is not going to deliver as there isn't much ""horror"" here to speak of really. This sequel is a much more entertaining and comedic film than the original.Don't expect to jump out of your seat in terror or be blown away by outlandish Hollywood special effects. Do expect to chuckle every now and then and be entertained. It has a slight child edge to it (ie grandpa's green dogworm & a prehistoric bird).DVD is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features. I doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film. I'm just happy it was released on DVD!If you are a fan of low budget horror/comedy movies this movie may appeal to you. It's no Evil Dead, but it is entertaining and a great movie for just about any age."
1,Avoid completely,"i watched this thinking it was going to be a decent sequel and my friend watching it with me kept commenting that he saw it when he was a kid and he thought it was good then. well not far into the movie you can see its going to be crappy. too family orientated to be a decent sequel to the first. but if you do have some youngsters that want to watch a 'scarey' movie than this would be good for that, other than that avoid at all cost."
1,AVOID THIS MOVIE!,This movie has one of the most incoherent plots of all time.It tellsthe story of two idiots who have a series of crazy misadventures.This movie suffers from poor special effects and an even poorer plot.See it only if you need a good laugh. Also this movie is a good one for the kiddies to enjoy.
2,"fun, but absolutely pointless...","I was a fan of House(the first of the series) and so purchased the combo DVD set of House and House 2. I watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while House is pretty good, House 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on. It is really quite dumb, but some of the creatures(i.e. ""catter-dog"" as I like to call him) are kind of fun to see. I would suggest skipping the second House unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be;-)"
2,A bit silly...,"This is more of a horror comedy than anything, and like 'BEETLEJUICE', it has it's ""scary"" moments. This may prove a bit silly for real horror fans."
3,It is okay for a comedy/horror,"This movie is funny and chilling at the same time ,Arye Gross and John Stark are funny."
4,Not as good as the first!,This movie other than the fact it makes no scence. First of all the grandfather was beried under ground for like 100 years and he is still living. and at the end the gunman was hiding in the cooker and shoots the grandfather. Other than that it is funny and scary.
1,STRAIGHT GARBAGE..,"..I recently purchased the first ""House"" movie, i remember watching it as a kid, it was apparently alot scarier during my adolesence, anyways the second one came with it for free, and i must say it was garbage, i did not have the patience to sit thru this crap, i now use this dvd disc as a cup coaster.Peace."
4,Best Book on the Subject,"Why do I give a damn about these people who have absolutely nothing to do with me? My sis lives in Vegas, and years ago when I was visiting, we were standing downtown when she pointed out that it was no longer ""Binion's Horseshoe"". She said it was due to the shady death of a family member.Well, this story has it all, sex, boobjobs, topless dancers, heroin, drive by shootings, and the most screwy attempted murder cover up ever. These people were the kind that typically do not make good criminals, genetically smiled upon individuals, whose brains should stay in their crotch.I have read ""Quicksilver, and two other books on the subject, and this is the best. Following the viewpoint of the head investigator, (who is a composite of law enforcement), watching the show as it unfolds,this book is easier to follow than the others yet does not sacrifice chronolology."
5,A Real Page Turner!,"I beg to differ with the reader from Scottsdale, AZ. I found King's book to be a real page-turner, as are all of King's books, from beginning to end. I particularly liked the historical aspects of the book, from background about Las Vegas and Nevada to background on the Binion family history. King doesn't pad his books with filler--instead he tells a story the way a story should be told. If you like romance and/or Gone With the Wind type stuff, or descriptions of city streets that take up eight pages or so every time a descriptive passage presents itself, then you should stick with the so-called and self-proclaimed ""Queen of True Crime."" If you're after hard-hitting true crime that really moves, page after page, then you'll like this book and just about anything else this guy has written."
2,An Early Grave,"I have a hard time with the condition portion of the description of the used books that I have bought. Although they (the sellers) consider their books in good condition, in my opinion, they are not in that good of condition. Or, there is a large range for good condition. I find that it costs me as much as a brand new book when shipping is included. I have bought books that have a .99 cent price tag from from the Goodwill store still attached to them and I pay an average of $10.00 (book + shipping) for the book. Considering this, all my used books that have been read once, are all in excellent condition and I would sell them for the same price as the used ones I have bought. Maybe it's just my personal critiquing that is the problem, but unless I really want to read a book that is no longer being printed, I will first try to locate it at the Goodwill store."
1,Pure Sleaze!,"Don't waste your time on this one. It lacks the forensic psychological profiling necessary for an interesting true crime book. If you're looking for more than just sleaze, read any of Ann Rule's books."
3,Almost a Runner,"I read this book after taking a writing seminar with the author. It's refreshing when a writing instructor actually publishes -- and Wisniewski practices what he preaches (forgive the cliche). The characters are original and the dialogue rings. However, I sense Wisniewski is holding back -- a little more and the story could explode into greatness. I'd buy the next book."
5,"an exciting, fast-paced trip through time aboard used cars.","Through the eyes of a young boy, readers will find themselves engulfed in an unusual experience. Set in the 195O's on the Polish-American south side of Milwaukee, this book will make you laugh and cry. Wisniewski has been compared to Mark Twain by a review in the LOS ANGELES TIMES; so if you enjoyed HUCKLEBERRY FINN, take a spin through CONFESSIONS OF A POLISH USED CAR SALESMAN"
1,Not what I ordered,I was sent a generic piece of crap from hong kong. I ordered a name brand product. They told me they were out of it and they sent me something better. HA! Liars.
1,Mildly problematic,"What a great idea. But this particular design was not capable of staying in the charging socket. It kept backing out on its own. The company very promptly sent me a replacement, but the replacement did the same. I drive a Subaru Forester, and I think it's socket would be the same as other manufacturer's, but nonetheless, I could not keep it in the socket. Gave up and bought another type."
4,"BEING A LITTLE CRITICAL,YES,BUT THIS STUFF GROWS ON YOU","First impressions:not a very smart singer -tries to add something different to old chestnuts by changing the melody in parts -comes out losing when the melodies are so great.Another reviewer kindly mentioning his ""chuckling ""when he blows a lyric, i find this annoying . That said ,this stuff grows on you if you're inclined to tumble down.Strange how he has mannerisms similar to Dean Martin (did Dean make a cowboy album?)For me the highlights are the whistling and the strange chicks in the background adding some weird showbiz flavor to these simple but strong songs.This is a good addition to cowboy song canon,even with the caveats!"
3,Very Sexy,"I have to admit, the reason I bought this movie is to see the stunning beauty Cynda Williams play the role as a sex crazed ghost. She has an unbelievably gorgeous body and I'm a fan for life. I guess the role didn't require her to have any lines. The movie was real slow and non-emotional. Leon is a good actor but its not much he can do with this script."
2,An okay movie. Was saved by Leon's acting.,"This movie was about a married couple who move into a 200 year old house on the North Carolina coast. They quickly discover that their new house already has a long-standing tenant (Arabella, who is a ghost) with a varocious sexual appetite and who has a vicious jealous nature. Arabella and John share a weird affair in the upstairs art studio while his pregnant wife is on bed rest. A so-so movie with strange things going on. Leon is a strong enough actor to pull off such a so-so movie."
2,GREAT CONCEPT--A BLACK THRILLER/LOVE STORY,"I LIKED THE CONCEPT OF THIS FILM. IT DEALS WITH THE PAST AND THE PRESENT. AFRICAN RELIGION AND AFRICAN AMERICAN SYMBOLISM, A LOVE TRIANGLE (A HUSBAND AND WIFE AND A GHOST. AND THE PAINTER/""VAN GOGH"" MENTAL ILLNESS CONCEPT. LEON AND REGINA TAYLOR ARE GOOD IN THIS. ITS GOOD TO SEE REGINA TAYLOR PLAY A DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER. SHE'S ALWAYS PLAYING A STOIC ASEXUAL CHARCTER IN MOVIES. TOO BAD THE MOVIE DOESN'T GET INTO THE SUBPLOT OF THE SLAVE GIRL (CYNDA WILLIAMS)MARRYING HER SLAVEMASTER AND HER TRAGIC DEMISE AND TEH HOUSE THAT SHE HAUNTS THAT LEON AND REGINA BUYS.. EXCELLENT AND INTELLIGENT FILM. GREAT SCENERY. THE END OF FILM IS CHEAPENED WITH NO EXPLANATION OF LEON'S CONDITION AFTER HIS SPIRIT CAME BACK FROM HBEING POSESSED BY THE SLAVE GIRLS' (CYNDA)SEXUAL POSESSION OF HIM. THE SEX SCENE WITH LEON (WHO HAS A GREAT BODY!) AND TEH GHOST AND REGINA TAYLOR CATCHING HIM WAS HILARIOUS!"
4,interesting,"I heard about this dcs from a friend, so I search and found it. It was interesting, I did enjoy it."
1,Leon!!!,1 star for Leon...he is so hot! He has a great body and super hot rear end. And just to let you know I am a 19 year old straight guy!
2,Who is the Slaveship Captain?,"Is that Christopher Northup playing the English slave ship captain? Man, at least somebody will break out of that film...Cynda is always amazing...Applause to Tim Ried for gettng it done."
1,Boring Film,"I didn't like this movie because it was so boring. Nothing scary really happened. It wasn't even a bit violent. This movie belongs in the thriller section only, because it's not a horror movie whatsoever.I kind of liked the acting. The beginning of the film is the kind of beginning that is put into a good horror movie. However this beginning tricks you. It seems like it is going to be a good horror flick, but turns out to be boring.The ending was kind of pointless, too."
5,"Rug Hooking Mofits ""But I Just Can't Draw"" Crowd-2nd Edition","I loved her first book and used it to decorate in my garden nursery, my customers always enjoyed the creativity of the mofits I used. Now with the second edition, I have designed and worked one rug and have another design ready to be hooked. These Mofits are for all people. They are helpful, especially for those looking for new ideas, and to those (like myself) without the imagination to come up with it on their own. Thanks to Ramona for making this possible and easy for us new to rug hooking."
2,A so-so history,"This book does not help me with the specific data I was looking for, ie: the famine of 1720s and ancient history. The author totally ignores the famine of the 1720s. He does give me a good sequence of the earlist populations, though very brief."
5,oh my gosh,"this is some of the best music i have ever heard. so much more rockin then the first release and that is good. i have been listening to this lp for so long and cant get enough. everyone enjoy. key tracks are when i get the feeling, making zealots, when pigs fly, still."
3,Who is killing the great fashion models of Italy?,"Like a lot of those 70's Italian sexy thrillers, or ""giallos"", this movie isn't as trashy as it may initially seem. Yes, there's gore and sex, but there's also style, humor, beautiful women, and credible acting. Set in the world of fashion photography, ""The Case of the Bloody Iris"" delivers a pretty good time. Excellent widescreen print and good dubbing, too."
2,Entertainment at a base level,"Unlike the other films in the Giallo Collection, Case of the Bloody Iris's worth rests solely on camp value and female nudity. Shot like 70s TV drama shows with flat, inexpressive lighting and banal camera work, it's barely competent, uninspired hack filmmaking. For Giallo fanatics only."
5,cant wait till summer,"very accurate when you throw it, cant wait to take it outside. it has a hard plastic ring, so not the best to throw inside."
2,Too flimsy,"I am dissapointed with the material used on this device. It seems too lightweight for an object that is going to be thrown around a yard, and shortly after we began using it, my concerns were validated as the fabric tore in several spots, and the cardboard 'circle' began to lose its shape. On the positive side, it is easy to toss and has a good trajectory."
2,First time user review,"Bought this based on a whim based the good reviews for my 7 year old boy & I to play.The good: Neat toy, went really far, and could be thrown pretty precisely. Everyone that saw it though it was neat and had never seen anything like it before.The bad: Don't try catching this thing without gloves. The ring at the bottom is fairly narrow and really slams on the ground upon landing. Both my son & I tried catching it a few times and decided not to do it again. We didn't get hurt but imagine someone could."
5,Please you must watch this 10 stars,"Joey may not be the greatest motorcycle racer ever, but hes the greatest man to ever race a bike!!!!!In America, road racing means racing around short circuits, but in Ireland and the isle of man, road racing means racing on roads at easily over 200mph and 1 lap is 37 miles long, need i go on!!!! great onboard lap with joey, some great footage from the early days, and also a very touching funeral!!!!!just brilliant"
1,Timberland will not repair this model,The Indiglo watches are from a separate manufacturer that no longer carries parts for this model.I recently found this out when I called because the watch I had was 'supposed' to be water proof up to 50 meters.I think they meant 50 centimeters cause I went in the pool and just dipped my arm and the damn watch began to beep.Needless to say it no longer works and Im outta luck.I will never buy another watch from this company.And btw their boots suck also.
1,Rip off copy of a great movie,This is one of the worst dvds I have seen.It looks like a very poor direct transfer from tape.And to cap it off the whole movie is one chapter.
3,"Forty thousand horsemen (1941) chips rafferty (40,000 horsemen)","A must for WW1 buff's, shows the australian ""she'll be right mate"" attitude that accompanied so many australian diggers through the war.the footage is recorded from original film and is a little ""jittery"" in the VERY begining but settles down ok, it even has the original ""intermission"" in the middle of DVD.realistic audio in battle scenes, none of this studio mixed sound effects but actual ""on feild audio"". so much noise its hard to distinguish what and where its comming from, just as it would have REALLY been like on the battle field.if you like the Australian LIGHT HORSE history then this should be in your movie collection,just remember this DVD is a direct copy of the original 1941 film, and the audio and visual quality is only as good as it was in 1941.having said that, i'd recomend it to any one who is interested in the Australian war effort."
2,"40,000 Horsemen","1938 film. Picture quality poor, sound poor. Story good. The first two points could more or less be expected. Film itself would appear to have been copied onto a computer."
4,Forty Thousand Horsemen,"I searched the UK amazon for this dvd for my father in law with no luck. But hey the oz amazon had, reasonably priced, postage to UK was reasonable too! it arrived as described within the month specified. overall score 10/10 xx"
2,Forty Thousand Horsemen,"Although it is a great movie, it cut out three quarters of the way through as if the DVD was faulty. Very disappointing not to see the end of the movie."
4,40000 Horsemen,Forty Thousand Horsemen (1941-Australia)Excellent - made in Australia but can only purchase through Amazon.
5,Today's Ovid - Timeless Love,"Just in time for Valentine's Day comes the timeless gift of Ovid's handbook on love. The ways of man and maid have not changed in the intervening two millennia, and Guy Lee makes that clear with this light, witty, and appropriately naughty version of these love poems. And his loyalty to the original Latin is beyond reproach. As the translator of Ovid's Heroides (Dutton, 1972), I can attest to the difficulty of the task, but Lee carries it off without apparent effort. The illustrations add a vivacious charm and remind the reader that these poems are classics in both the popular and the traditional sense of the term. If you haven't time to brush up your Latin, or you never had any, this book is the answer!"
5,"Fascinating, informative, insightful reading.",Barbara Watterson's Gods Of Ancient Egypt explores the main characteristics of ancient Egyptian religions and provides the first book to trace the origins of all the major deities of ancient Egypt. Photos and illustrations provide lavish embellishment for a treatise linking Egyptian history of cultural and spiritual change.
2,Clear but not for too long,"I purchased this product directly from the Apple store when I purchased my iPhone, about 45 days ago. That is how long it has taken to change the color of this ""clear"" case to turn yellow!!!! I work in an office, not any place prone to grease or dirt yet this case now makes my $600 iPhone look like trash. DO NOT BUY THE CLEAR. I wanted the Black but at the time I could find one."
2,"Silicon case good, belt clip bad","Well, the title really says it all. The silicon skin works quite well with access to all the physical buttons of the iPhone. And the iPhone definitely feels protected from (short) falls. However, the belt clip when it's on the belt digs into your side. In a way, I suppose it's reassuring to know that the phone is there, but on the other hand, I don't need a literal thorn in my side to remind me. Other than the physical pain of wearing the belt clip, the case and the clip integrate quite nicely.If you're looking for nice pain-free belt clip, I recommend the DLO Black lambskin Exposed leather Holster for the iPhone. After wearing the Speck belt clip for a couple of days, I found the DLO holster, and this works (and feels) much better."
4,Met my expectations. Better than Darkseed original.,"I enjoyed the game, but needed to find a run-through after getting stuck once or twice. It's got lots of characters, good and bad, a good plot, a good maze, lots of adventure, not too many puzzles. I enjoyed the original Darkseed and played it quite a few times, and always hoped they'd come out with a sequel. Giger's art is impressive."
2,"Button trouble, dead handset","We've had this set (base + 3 cordless sets) for 10+ years. It may have been a good product at the time we bought it but it seems outdated today. In terms of reliability, one of the satellite cordless sets died about a year ago and the '3' button on another started having trouble a year before then. Overall, we're not impressed with the set and will be replacing it and switching to another brand (likely Panasonic) soon. Among the problems or annoyances with it, besides the two mentioned above, have been a difficulty to share the stored phone numbers among the sets, the lack of the LCD backlighting on the cordless units, and the lack of a clock on the cordless sets. We also had trouble transferring calls between handsets (though it's possible, it's not easy)."
2,Al Jourgensen high. That is all. The End.,"This thing is 93 minutes of nothing more than Al getting high and his behavior while high. It's not about Ministry as a band at all. It's more sad than entertaining. This thing should have been a 10 minute bonus footage track on some Ministry Live DVD. 90minutes of Al Jourgensen high is boring.The interviews with Ogre, David Yow, Maynard and others is interesting but there is very little of this in it.Don't waste your time or money on this. Instead go buy/watch the LEMMY documentary. It IS worth watching.Lemmy: 49% Motherf**ker, 51% Son of a Bitch [Blu-ray]"
2,Vaguely amusing,"The best part of this movie is Jello Biafra reminding everyone that The Eagles behaved about as well as Al and no one ever batted an eye. The second best part is Buzz Osbourne's dog. What remains is just a lot of stereotypical rockstar antics--screaming, throwing furniture, banging groupies and drugs. It is, of course, edited in such a way as to make it appear that heroin was being injected on a nigh continuous basis, but if you pay attention it's really just two or three episodes chopped up and spread out over the course of the film.It's not difficult to see why Barker left, nor is it difficult to see what exactly Al's contributions were. It is, however, difficult to pay attention to, so unless you just want to see how jowly Trent Reznor is looking these days, you should probably keep your money. Touring is boring enough to drive anyone to drugs."
2,What is this exactly?,"As a Ministry fan who looked forward to this film, I am very disappointed. What exactly is this movie about? Drinking? Drugs? Life on the road? It's essentially 100 minutes of drunk, paranoid ramblings, drug abuse and nothingness. I did not walk away from this movie learning a thing. In fact, I feel bad for Al...the movie makes him look like a moron 99% of the time.If you're a fan like me, seek out a free copy. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this. It's a pointless film...and that pains me to say it as a fan."
4,Intense,This is one of the most intense documentaries about a band i have ever seen. It is a must have if you are a huge Ministry fan. There is not a lot of live footage but it really lets you have a good in depth behind the scenes experience.
5,Fix the ministry movie,A great documentary taking you back to the old days of the Jorgensen / barker ministry plus barker's fix this is a sonic delight
2,Don't judge the play by this film version,"There is a stage revival of this play recently presented in New York and I was curious to see this film version. I found it very dull. Walter Matthau acted very well but I thought him miscast (appearing too old, to me, for the part of the angry war vet). Felicia Farr (Jack Lemmon's wife) was excellent, though certainly there was no chemistry between her and Matthau. I don't know what happened to actor Robert Lipton; he does a good job here as the frustrated idealist. As a bit of theatrical history (many consider this to be Odets's best play), you could do worse, but the play deserves a better film version."
3,Short run on Broadway,"AS live on Broadway archives comparable cassics, buy ""The Iceman Cometh"" or ""The glass menagerie"" or""A long days journey into night"". 3 goodies, but skip this one ?"
3,Risky,"I had no idea why my GWS Slow Stick rc plane had a hard time taking off initially, and why it would quickly pull to the lef. There are 3 issues:1) The hard plastic that is glued in the middle of the wings is hard to install. If you are not too careful, the wing's dihedral angle will be affected. I ended up having to fix my wing by cutting the hard plastic in a couple of spots, bending the wing by hand and taping them in the correct shape.2) The tendency of pulling upwards and to the left is common with the Slow Stick. The motor mount is off by 5 degrees upwards and to the left. I found at least two video clips where other people have encountered the same problem.The Slow Stick is not a good first plane. A plane with the prop in the rear would be a better start. The best way to start is with a flight simulator!!"
1,No motor comes with this plane. I wish I would have known that NPS means (No Power System)!!!!!!!,"When you use initials (N.P.S.) to describe something.... you should define what those initials mean as well (No Power System)!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont know anything about ""building"" a remote control airplane and never would have purchased this product had I known that it didn't come with a motor or a remote control. Now I have to spend hundreds of dollars to ""build"" this plane for use, and I have to pay someone to build it. This was intended for my 12 year old to fly. I would NEVER have purchased a ready-to-use remote control airplane that cost hundreds of dollars for my 12 year old to play with. Next time you write a description of a product, SPELL IT OUT!!!!!! I believe this was false advertisement and I won't ever buy a product that only has initials in the description again."
2,Not to be compared to The Nonesuch Lure,I thought this was just plain silly: not at all suspenseful as Mary Luke's The Nonesuch Lure. Promised much; delivered very little. Sorry.
2,"Sounds great, for a short time","I received these as a gift a few years ago. I liked that it was two sets of headphones and a Y adapter in one box. The headphones sounded very good for a cheap set of headphones for a short time. Within 2 months, the speakers inside the ear pieces started to work loose and rattle with the music. I first though it may be a defect with one of the two in the package, so I switched to the other one in the set of two. It had the same problem that the first one did, but lasted about 3 months before it started to rattle and become annoying. They do have a lifetime warranty, so hopefully Koss will replace them with a better set."
5,"Great price, great product","I enjoy nice things, but like everyone else, want to pay less for them. This frame is fantastic."
4,"great show, only missing 5.1 or DTS","Great show, all the hits, only improvements would be to a) Not make some of the hits a medley and b) not only be recorded in Dolby 2.0."
3,Frankie Valli,"The songs bring back memories, but the tempo and enthusiasm is not there. I saw him live about 2 years ago and it was great. I bought this DVD to watch while I exercise. I use it on a slow day."
3,Good Video Overrated preformer thinks he is the best,Nice product. But Frankie thinks he is the best and there are other preformers that run circle around him. Check out the johnny maestro and the brooklyn brige concert and see a better preformance. I am from chicago so this is not a new york bias review
4,Good but not great,"I admit I'm not a Frankie Valli ""fan"". I like him, the 4 Seasons, and his music. I bought this DVD as I like to watch concerts when working out on my rowing machine. So I was expecting a live album with video.The songs are great, very few surprises there. But this is more a tribute to Mr. Valli's professionalism, not his enthusiasm. He's still a great performer (very little falsetto anymore, which is fine), and he knows how to work the crowd. But overall, he seems to be going through the motions. He's singing songs and using patter as if he's done this thousands of times before -- which he has. I don't know if he's having an off night, or this is just his style, but don't expect to be blown away by his stage presence or feel a special concert ""spark"". It's just not there.What is there is a good set list of tunes you'll remember and enjoy. I recommend this DVD, as long as you manage your expectations."
3,What's with that audience???,"I bought this video on a lark... I was looking for video to exercise by while on my treadmill. The production was good and Mr. Valli was giving it his all, but ""oh, that audience!"" They seemed to be in a comatose state... showed no enthusiasm for the music. Where did they get those people??? At a funeral home??? Anyway, the songs brought back all my teenaged memories and the video was a good addition to my ""oldies"" collection. I would recommend it to anyone who sang along with those songs on their transistor radios! It will bring back tons of memories of those days."
2,Wow... This is NOT what I expected.....,"Being a HUGE 4 Seasons fan, I thought this would be a great dvd to have - all the guys, live!! WRONG ! Apparently, Frankie Valli now owns the name ""The 4 Seasons"" and that is what his back up singers are referred to!! They are just a bunch of guys! I'm not saying they're aren't accomplished musicians & singers, etc..etc but they are not the guys who sang & performed all those wonderful hits so many years ago. I was hoping that I could ""go back""...but you cannot. Whadda ya gonna do."
3,Live???,I was excited to see a live taping of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons after seeing Jersey Boys on Broadway. Unfortunately Frankie sang and looked very bored and put on a lackluster show. I am so happy there are other reproductions of their music to listen to. It was a disappointing show for me.
1,Egypt travel Atlas - Lonely Planet Series,"This atlas is way out of date (i.e., 1996) and not for the serious drive-yourself traveler. Be aware that most road identification signs are in Arabic, with only the major routes identified in English. I suggest using an up-to-date map, such as the Bartholomew World travel Map series - obtainable in bookstores located in Egypt."
1,so out of date it is dangerous,"I have been traveling around Egypt by 4WD, along the Nile valley and also in the Eastern and the Western Deserts. I took this book and found it useless -- worse than useless, in fact, because it is so inaccurate and out of date that it is dangerous to rely on. I recommend instead a good map such as that by Freytag + Berndt."
1,An excellent soporific,"I'd read several highly positive comments about this book on the DorothyL mailing list, so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I couldn't get beyond page 42. Nothing in those pages had grabbed me sufficiently to make me want to continue. Where the cover blurb raves ""lighthearted and sparkling"" I would substitute ""trite and sophomoric."" The main characters are Ike and Abby, recently divorced but still managing to work, tango, and skate together. Ike is the woman, and Abby is the man. Isn't that cute? They set out to solve the murder of Connie Candela, the new co-anchor of a morning television program at NTB, where Ike and Abby are both employed. I think there may be a decent puzzle in there somewhere, because the circumstances of the murder do immediately raise questions about how this murder was committed as well as who committed it. However, I was unwilling to slog through an additional 257 boring pages of narrative in order to satisfy my mil! d curiosity."
5,Quick & Entertaining read,"This book is a must for cat lovers. I've owned cats all of my life and they still fascinate me. This book is full of funny and intriguing tales from a cat behaviorial specialist. I finished reading it within a few hours, it was so interesting - I couldn't stop. Even when I thought I might know a lot about feline behavior - I was surprised to learn a great deal more from these stories."
3,"A book of anecdotes in which, amazingly, every story has a happy ending.","More for entertainment than for disseminating specific cat-care information. Read it in an hour and a half, gave it to my wife."
2,"Some amusing stories, but did she exaggerate them?","The author presents some stories about how she successfully solved problems related to cat behavior. Every story ends the same way, with Pam Johnson-Bennett making an astute diagnosis and saving the day. Everything is neatly tied up by the end of each chapter.I wanted to believe her, but I came away with the feeling that at the very least, she took some real liberties with the truth."
3,"I have never seen or read this, not sure why it is in my review box?","I have never seen or read this, not sure why it is in my review box?"
5,I have it!,I feel very fortunate to have this book as it is now out of print. I bought it in 1993 at a book store and just ran into it on a whim. I enjoyed the book as it had a lot of information about Reba and her journey through life so far. Up to this point I have every book that has been written about her and find this one to be very informative.
2,Difficult company to work with,"Mop did not stand up to use. When I called the company to report the issue and return the mop, the company was very difficult to work with and said I had to go back to Amazon for the refund. Amazon said I had to go back to the company. When I emailed the mop company about this, they never responded. In the end, Amazon showed excellent customer service and refunded my money back. Shortly after, I received a call from the mop company stating that their return policy is 30 days, and again not responsive or willing to return the product. Poor customer service. Thank you Amazon for your excellent response and customer service. I will definetely buy through Amazon again, but would not recommend the mop or mop company."
1,Lasted 4 uses,"After the fifth use, this mop's head totally fell apart. I didn't abuse it or anything, it just is cheaply made. Stay away."
2,what a mess!,"""Devil Take the Blue-tail Fly"" is not a good book, to put it charitably. The story about a concert musician coming home from a asylum and being confused about the actions of her husband and acquaintances simply doesn't hold together. Worse, the author throws in a humongous twist at the end that supposedly explains it all. None of it is plausible, not even close.Bottom line: a disappointing book on multiple levels. Not recommended."
5,A delightful read!,"Rarely does a work of non-fiction captivate me so! I've been surprised to find myself thinking about our heroines throughout the day, and looking forward to reading a chapter each night. I believe Marshall is a master at her craft.I recommend this book not only to anyone interested in feminism, American history, and Boston, but also to anyone who just enjoys a good read. Call me a nerd, but I say, Ladies, throw down your chick lit, and pick up The Peabody Sisters!"
4,Women in Transition,"This book proved interesting, and I felt that many issues still resonate today. Women have many more opportunities now, but marriage and motherhood still present conflicts concerning career and home life. The three Peabody sisters were admirable in their search for knowledge and influence in America in the early 1800's. I found the Unitarian and Transcendentalism issues interesting as well. Religion seemed to be in a state of flux moreso than today. It is a long book, but well researched and fascinating when you find three sisters from a relatively poor family become so knowledgeable that they have no problem discussing life and theology with Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, Horace Mann, Rev. Channing, Wordsworth, and many more literary and educational giants of the day."
4,Well researched and long overdue,"At the center of the American Renaissance stand several families whose impact has been often studied and written about. One family of women has been clearly neglected and their impact downgraded, the Peabody Sisters. Megan Marshall has written a very well researched and long overdue work of depth that flows along lightly. Highly readable, this work articulates the contributres of Elizabeth, Mary and Sophia (wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne) in prose that reads more like a novel than like a multi-subject biography. For those interested in the American Renaissance, American Romanticism, Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, early feminism, and literary excellence this book is a necessary presence on your bookshelf. Do yourself a favor and read this book. I highly recommend it for scholars and layman."
4,"Kill the ""soulful"" ballad at the end","I am referring to the last ballad called ""My heart, farewell"" that was mercifully omitted on the CD. It ruined the whole show. Celine Dion knock-offs simply have no place in an Irish show. Why couldn't the director put a more authentic Irish lament, preferably in Gaelic?"
4,Really Nice Little Book,Really cute book with beautiful illustrations. Very funny premise. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it seems kind of short--even compared to other pre-school picture books. But my 4-year-old daughter has enjoyed it very much.
4,Nice extension and decent price,"This is a very nice extension track for the Rokenbok monorail, and mostly required if you want to have more than an oval. It is actually bigger than it looks and on Christmas day it took me quite a while to set it up so it would fit on the table with the other Rokenbok stuff, have an interesting shape *and* integrate with the starter set. That said, it is easy to build one of the examples and you can invent your own as well as there are plenty of pieces. More slopes would be good though as there are only 4. Ideally, I would like to get a second set for more freedom and being able to build the track upwards and save a bit of space while making it more fun for the kids."
4,Grandson ask for this.,"Grandson,who is 10 loves this and plays with other children age 6 up to adult. Very entertaining with additional items sold seperately."
2,Beautiful music but...,"the constant noise of the river just really sounds like static--very annoying, in my opinion. If I am upstairs, I can hear just the music and it's better.I usually love music accompanied by the sound of water. However, on the other CD's and tapes I have, the sounds and tempo and intensity and kinds of water VARY.The river is a distraction--and this tape (surprisingly!) is advertised for meditation!"
4,Why not D'Angelo,"The first song that came to mind when I thought of songs that would be on the Brown Sugar soundtrack was the song Brown Sugar by D'Angelo. But I soon came to realize that they didn't have it on the soundtrack. Why not? It's a great song, and it would have fit right in with the theme."
1,Warning! Copy Protected CD May Not Work In Your Player,"I loved the movie and had to have the soundtrack. Unfortunatly, when I got it home, I could not get it to play in my stereo's CD player! Won't work on my computer either! Stay away from these copy protected CDs! There's a good chance, you will not be able to listen to it!"
1,Watch out for backdoor computer programs,Sony has gone too far. Until they recall all XCP DRM discs and hand out free copies to exploited consumers then I will continue to boycott them. Five stars for Don't give Sony a penny till they make a full applogy for this mess. Don't buy this cd.
1,This CD has been recalled because it contains a rootkit,"WARNING - DO NOT BUY THIS CD. This CD is infected with DRM, a technology that not only limits what you can do with the music but actually affects the ability of your computer to do other unrelated tasks and opens you up to viruses and privacy infringements. Sony has actually recalled this CD and by all rights it should no longer be for sale on Amazon. In general, don't buy any CDs that are labeled ""Copy Protected"" or are made by Sony."
4,watch the movie,"the music is good, but it makes the movie great. Don't try to copy or daownload it though cause it won't work. It's a good mix of soul and hip hop."
4,Nice Mix of R&B and Hip Hop,"For those of you who enjoy both Hip-Hop and R&B, you will enjoy this soundtrack. It has smooth melodic songs from R&B queens such as Angie Stone, Jill Scott and Mary J. Blige and rump shakin' beats from Mos Def and Lateef. One plus is Cassandra Wilson's rendition of ""Time After Time"" (originally done by Cindy Lauper). Her tenor voice and smooth jazzy style brings a millennium twist to this 80's hit. In addition, a remix of the classic Hip-Hop jam ""Paid in Full"" by Eric B. and Rakim is there for all the old schoolers. With 12 out of 15 tracks being ""ear candy"", it got 4 stars in my book."
2,...but its a strong two,"Honestly, I should have just bought Erykah Badu's 'Love of my Life' as a single. And what a wonderful 'single' it is. Jill Scott, Angie Stone, Rashaan Patterson's contributions are nice, though not as fresh sounding as Badu's. But they do make me feel better about purchasing a cd with only one, and I mean 'one', really strong track on it. To be honest, I'm not a fan of rap music. Therefore I cannot offer any unbiased compliments or criticisms of those tracks. I'll simply limit my opinions to wishing this had not been another hybrid hip-hop/neo-soul project."
3,Movie was better than the music,I loved the movie but the music was okay but it was a hit and miss. Some songs you could play over and over and others you wondered what the heck were they thinking when they arranged the cd.
2,Big Disappointment,I loved the movie and just knew the soundtrack would be great but I was really disappointed. The first three tracks were great but the rest of the CD was just not good.
1,The copyright protections ruins a good cd,"I was happy to buy this cd because I love Jill Scott, Angie Stone, and Mary J. However, I recommend that everyone stay away from this and others with the new copyright protection. This feature doesn't let you record your own cds to make mix cds with the songs you like best (or hate worse - whatever your mood!) for your own personal use. Also, this cd plays great in my car and in my clock radio - but it doesn't play in my stereo. Tsk tsk to the manufacturer."
4,SOME OF THE BEST ''PORN GRIND/DEATH'' EVER!!,LIVIDITY..the new MENTOR's for HETERO's!!!This band can always make me laugh..just like THE MENTOR's before them LIVIDITY are taking back our women and being even more violent about it!!This album is honestley a CLASICK in PORN DEATH GRIND..TOP NOTCH STUFF IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF THING!!I suggest you get their live album as well as ''AGE..'' GREAT BAND!!!''Come on in (...) lover's''..most hilairious sample ever!!
4,Excellent for staff training,"We used this book last year for training our staff and we are looking forward to using it again. If you are in the service industry this book is a must for you. The authors used clear, diverse and practical examples of how to better a serve a diverse clientele. The workbook style made the topics approachable and simple. My staff really enjoyed what they learned and I found that they put the information to use.I liked the diversity of cultural examples in the workbook; it was not just from one or two cultures. We did some fun role playing with book during our staff training.I highly recommend this book to any business seeking to be more in tune and ready to serve all their customers and even expand their customer base."
3,Bought as a gift.,"Purchased as a gift for someone, so I really didn't read it. Just heard it was good. So wanted to help her out."
1,God Awful,"I found this series to be APPALLING. The first entire CD was interviews of Chritians who had raised strong willed children. It was a lot of hand-wringing.....""oh we've suffered,"" kind of stuff Christians seem to love.Most of the people interviewed spanked their children (sometimes up to 5 times per day or morefor being strong willed)......and the worst part was that this was ENCOURAGED. Other types of harsh corporal punishment were also condoned.I am a clinician. I also have a strong-willed child. I have read (or listened to audio) of dozens and dozens of parenting books. And I have to say that the advice given on this audio book goes against every bone in my body as well as most current parenting thought and knowledge.Thankfully, I follow other types of parenting advice and my daughter is thriving.DON'T BUY THIS TERRIBLE BOOK."
1,I found some of his advice disturbing.,"I am a parent of a strong willed two and a half year old. I agreed with Dr. Dobson that sometimes spanking is necessary, however, he is totally opposed to non violent ways of dicipline such as the popular Time Out technique which DOES WORK. I stopped reading when he suggested hitting your child with a belt or a switch on the legs if he/she gets out of bed, and that he rather parents hit their children with a paddle, belt or switch instead of using their hand for spanking. I found that to be terribly disturbing and could be dangerous if read by a parent who lacks self control and/or parenting skills.Hitting children with belts is when the line is crossed from dicipline to abuse."
1,Dr. Dobson and Mr. Spock from Star Trek,"First, that shoulder pinch trick he loves, reminds me of Mr. Spock's Neck pinch that was used in Star Trek to knock out people.Really, Dr. , a phaser blast to a STRONG WILLED CHILD would work better.Violence to solve and stop violence, how confusing and troubling coming from a follower of Christ.On the bright side, it makes good starting fuel for kindling wood."
1,Anyone who admits to beating a 12 lb. dog with a belt . . .,"I can't believe it. In the very first chapter Dobson describes how he beat his 12 lb. dachshund with a belt. And this man thinks he is an expert on behavior? Clearly he's a sadist, not a psychologist. I've had dachshunds (and strong willed children), and I'm appalled."
1,promotes violence,"In the introduction, Dr. Dobson compares raising a strong-willed child to beating his dog with a belt. He seems to focus a lot on the parent having power over the child and assumes the child is strong-willed because of bad intentions. He gives about 50 reasons why you should spank your child. The violence made me a little sick to my stomach:("
3,Not as exptected,"This book was not what I expected. I bought this to help with our toddler, but I'm not sure it was what we needed. It may work well for someone else."
1,"If you want an antagonistic relationship, then this book is for you.","I picked up this book along with several others in order to work with my difficult son, and I was blown away at the perspective that Dobson takes on difficult children.He takes the view that when children misbehave it is a deliberate effort to make life difficult for the parents. I can't imagine any real Christian parent sincerely subscribing to the maxim of ""beating the devil"" out of your children, but this is the closest thing I have come across to this view.If you want to love and respect your child, I would recommend Stanley Turecki's The Difficult Child."
2,Way Too Right Wing,"I am a strong Christian. However, this book was way too right wing for me. After ordering it I talked with a counselor about it and she said it is not one that she recommends either."
5,Good information and confirmation that your not alone in this...,"I found the book to be very good. I listened to it on CD's and I believe there were 5. The first two CD's focused quite a bit on religion, and I'm Jewish. The rest of the book focused on the issues at hand on dealing with a very young strong willed child, through the teen years.I found it to be very informative with good suggestions and alturnitives. It also made me realize the degree, or level my child is at. It discusses the mild ""strong willed child"", to the highest level."
1,"a scary man, wouldn't want him near my kids","This is my first review. Dobson's message of bring-the-fear-of-God to your children is extremely disturbing to me. If you believe that instilling fear is the best means to break a strong willed child, then push that ""put it in my cart"" button for this book. If you believe a relationship between a parent and a child should be based on a respectful, sometimes tough teaching paradigm which ultmiately ensures a child can make their own good choices, check out the ""Love and Logic"" series. I have nothing to gain financially from making this recommendation. It could keep me awake at night, thinking of people accepting Dobson's pious, totalitarian philosophy as any kind of answer to the challenges of child raising. I wrote this review so I could get back to sleep."
3,Alittle disappointed...,"My disappointment was with seeing people today. They are not going to raise their children in christain homes, because everything has gone secular...and attitudes are bad because of whats around us. I did like it about HDAD...but then again...he says there is no cure for it and he states, he didn't know causes it."
2,"Nothing ""New"": just recycled and out of date advice","Dobson doesn't really have anything ""New"" in this book except the title, an attempt to sell more books, as if this was an update from his previous ones, and it is not. He ignores decades of research findings about the best ways to raise healthy and successful children, and instead reverts to his standard method -- ""pick up a belt or a board and hit them, and don't allow them to cry longer than a few minutes, or hit them more until they stop crying about it."" Parents who are seduced by his folksy style into following his advice are likely to injure their children and invite child protective agencies into their lives. Dobson is the dinosauer of child rearing -- he needs to become extinct. This book is harmful, creating the opposite effect of what parents really want for their children."
1,Is there a support group for the children survivors of this book?,"I suppose that should some up the review.But truly, I grew up under the sick-minded, mercy & forgiveness free parenting teachings of Dobson. My mom loved the strong willed child. It destroyed our family.I was hoping there is some sort of support group out there for people how suffered through his sick teachings. I know there is a lot of support against similar teachings from ""To Train Up A Child"" authors (the Pearls). IF anyone knows, I'd love to get hooked up. I think it might be a path to finish healing.Honest to goodness, I've forgiven my parents (though I have disowned them), but I can't seem to forgive Dobson who empowered them & gave them ideas about calling me evil-intentioned when I was not. Taught them ways to be violent (shoulder pinch?) and so much more. Can we send him to Guantanamo?"
5,A must read!,"I was skeptical about reading this book because I want to have a positive parenting experience and didn't want it to be all about spanking. Let me tell you, it is about so much more than spanking. This book has really assisted me in dispelling the mother guilt that has held me captive and stolen my confidence and joy as a mom sometimes. I am SO grateful to not only have read the stories of other parents but also to have some guide posts about when to put my foot down and how to do it in an effective way. We all want to do the right thing with our kids and we want them to know we love them and have security in our relationship parent-child relationship. This book has helped me get a confident grip on my role as a parent and to do it with building confidence as I balance love and discipline. This is a must read!"
1,Just a replica of Dobson's other twisted books,"This book is just like any other one of the ""child-rearing"" books by James Dobson which does not give any psychological help or truly Christian advice but only keeps repeating that you must beat your child into submission instead of teaching them right from wrong. Parents might want to consider that Dobson does not have a doctorate in the training of children but of animals and according to his latest book, as well as the others, he believes you should treat both the same. So don't waste your money on this book because here is the thesis of it in a nut shell: Hit your kids until they're senseless instead of incorporating morals into them. This book belongs to criminals and child-abusers, not parents looking for Christian or even decent advice on how to raise innocent children."
1,Paging Dr. Child Abuse.....,"Sickening drivel! Comparing children to dogs, and that both need to be beaten! How is this author a doctor in anything????"
1,A World of Disagreement With Dobson's Cruelty,"A new book from UNESCO shows results of a recent worldwide survey of the archaic practices of corporal punishment of children. ""Eliminating Corporal Punishment"" explains the urgent necessity of abolishing completely the practice of hitting children, and reveals the evidence that corporal punishment results in seriously damaging consequences.It goes further: Where spanking, pinching, shaking, and hair-pulling are inflicted on children, those homes are the training grounds for the crimes and wars and abuse that parents claim to condemn.Over ten years ago the UN Convention on the rights of the Child clearly and famously stated: ""ALL FORMS OF CORPORAL PUNISHMENT OF CHILDREN, INCLUDING IN THE FAMILY, ARE PROHIBITED."" Is his mind and heart so closed that Mr. Dobson cannot focus on this important message? James Dobson, please hear this: HITTING A CHILD IS A BULLYING, COWARDLY ACT. - Norm Lee, author of ""Parenting Without Punishing"""
2,Rambles too much,I sent this book and his workbook back. I felt he just rambled and did not get to the point. I got bored at the beginning. I tried other chapters and still could not get the book to work for me. Sorry...
1,Legitimizes child abuse,"I found this book offensive. It encourages coercive and dangerous methods of punishment like spanking which studies have shown don't work.Here is a quote: ""The spanking may be too gentle. If it doesn't hurt, it doesn't motivate a child to avoid the consequence next time. A slap with the hand on the bottom of a diapered two-year-old is not a deterrent to anything. Be sure the child gets the message.""I discourage parents from getting this book as it promotes mistreatment of children. There are dozens of other ways to discipline and this isn't one that is respectful to growing people."
2,The CD Titles,"The product itself is fine. But the CD was dubbed over some secular CD with titles about ""sex."" I was making a backup onto my computer when I discovered the titles from some other album instead of the titles of the book."
1,A Strong-Willed Child,"This book is terrible. It talks about children like we're sub-human. It also talks about whipping dogs and spanking which is not in the Bible! Since when does God come out of the clouds and whip dogs and hit children's butts. Adults should wake up and treat all people like people. If they want to hit someone they should hit real criminals, not little children. Or we might hit back! Read a better book, like Paddington Bear books or mysteries and just talk with your children and understand their lives.Having a strong will is a good thing!"
1,Guide to adversarial parenting,"I used this book with my oldest 3 children, and it was a disaster. I am disgusted with the kind of parent I was when I was following Dr. Dobson's advice. It is nothing more than dominating your child to make them easier to live with. This is the WORST possible advice for dealing with a child who has any spark of individuality or spirit. Two thumbs waaaaay down."
1,Disturbing,"This book is dangerous and disturbing. It makes me sad that so many parents are fans of the concept of ""making"" your child obey. There are better ways and much better books."
1,Oversimplification,"Before I continue I should state that I am not against spanking, so my review is not based on any opposition with Dr Dobsons view, but on the actual content and style of what was written.The problem I have with this book is it makes the assumption that all children react the same way to physical punishment. Any parent that would apply a little common sense to discipline will realise that this just isnt the case and that all children react differently to any given punishment depending on their personality and temperament. This book is just Dr Dobsons repeated singular message padded with personal stories and scripture. I found it so one dimensional I gave up on it with just a few pages left.There must be better books on discipline then this out there."
1,You're advocating illegal acts.,"I remove children from abusive parents daily.Legally, you cannot hit your child with anything but your open hand on any area but your child's buttocks. If a neighbor, friend, teacher or family member calls Child and Family Services because your child reports to them that you are doing what Dr. Dobson advocates, your child could be removed from your care."
2,Bad book great customer service,"The book arrived quickly and appeared to be in new condition. However, as I began to read it I ran into a problem. It appears there was an issue when binding the book. Pages 86 to 102 and missing completely and pages 201 to 235 are printed twice.I received excellent custoemr service from AMAZON when I reported the problem and a replacement book arrived within 5 days of my compliant. Repalcement book is also new and was boudn crooectly with all pages appearing only once."
1,The New Strong-Willed Child,"On p. 125-130 Dobson inserts an article that claims the research on corporal punishment is mostly ""opinion-driven"" and ""flawed"" and ""spanking is not abuse"" if done ""appropriately and not in anger"". This article also recommends hitting a toddler who hits, or the toddler's ""hitting will persist or even escalate."" This information by Dobson like much of the book is ""opinion-driven"" and ""flawed"". The research on corporal punishment of children consistently finds evidence of harm and it is being regularly replicated by unbiased researchers. Corporal punishment of children has been banned in seventeen countries. The World Health Organization has just announced that it is a ""predictable and preventable"" health problem and should be eliminated. Parents should be wary about the opinions expressed in this book. Nadine Block"
1,Absolutely Shocking!,Zero stars. It is so shocking to me that Dobson hits his dog with a belt as well as children! I cannot understand why he thinks this is the correct form of discipline! There is no doubt in my mind that Dobson dislikes children!
1,This book keeps the cycle of violence going,"This book is based on the assumption that most children are born with an inclination toward aggression, dishonesty, rebellion and greed and therefore the author recommends parents to use physical punishment and other mean spirited actions in order to rein the child's will from a very young age (eighteen months) and force him into submission. The book views parent child relationship as a constant struggle for power and control and advocates disrespect, violence and unkindness toward children. Children learn most from the way they are treated. This book keeps the cycle of violence going and passes it on to the next generation."
1,Jesus would never treat a child like this.,"There are better ways. I highly recommend books by Christians like Clay Clarkson and Dr. Sears. Another wonderful book is ""How Would Jesus Raise a Child."" Can anyone really imagine Jesus using corporal punishment on children? We are to model ourselves after him (as I'm sure Dobson would agree), so shouldn't we also model our parenting practices after him? Please read one of the other books recommended above instead."
3,Hopeful,Haven't finished it yet. The beggining not easy to read through - seems like a transcipt of a radion show. I was looking for more quick advise but my friends recommend so I will finish reading it.
1,For Parents Who Can't Understand the Difference Between Discipline and Punishment,"Beating your kids is not a good thing. There are some who think it's an occasional sad necessity with some subgroup of ""problem kids"". What I find off-putting is the tone of almost gleeful relish Dobson seems to use when he writes about physical violence against children. His words read like those of a sadist hiding behind cheap rationalizations. In any case, there are many other strategies that have been shown to be much more effective."
1,This book is NOT what you need!,"I actually rate this book NO STARS, but the form requires a minimum of 1. I was appalled at some of his ideas! What ever happened to rearing children with LOVE and gentle guidence? My book went right in the circular file! There are much much much better books out there. Skip this one."
1,Not worth it,I was astonished after so many people recommened this book how utterly off the mark it was with current parenting preactices. The sheer thought that one should physically harm their child in order to show them whos boss is beyond what my mind can wrap itself around.This was a waste of money and the time I spent reading it.
1,No Thanks,"I purchased this book after it was recommended to me to help deal with my spirited preschooler. The person mentioned that spanking was advocated in the book, which gave me pause, but parents in my situation know that you are willing to hear out anything that might help. But after paging through the book I did some research on the author and was horrified to discover who this man is and what he stands for. In a nutshell, this man was a prominant Evangelical Christian who in addition to corporal punishment advocates that: women should know their place, thinks gay relationships are destroying society, non-traditional sexual roles are abominations, and on and on. I have a live and let live viewpoint on religion in general but I refuse to financially support anyone whose views are so at odds with mine. So this guy may be the child whisperer but I'm not going to find out because I'm returning the book and going with MacKenzie's work on the same topic."
1,Bully 'em into submission,Dobson has an obsession with control that is very disturbing.His methods are mainly those of the schoolyard bully and seem to be contrived to raise kids who are afraid of you. Is that really the result you want?It's interesting that many cases of elder abuse involve grown children giving a long-overdue payback to the parents who beat them when they were young.
1,Kristian Facist,..just like his teaching on every thing. AVOID. I know one girl - who's parents followed this book - in spite of the fact that the girl was NOT strong willed - she ended up lesbian - probably partly just to spite them.
1,Misleading title,This is a heavily christian based book with a lot of Jesus references. That disclaimer should be put right on the cover. This book was useless to a non christian reader.
3,Sold under incorrect label,"Bought The New Strong-Willed Child as a ""new"" book. When it arrived this seemed to be the case, cover and spine in excellent condition, no dog-eared pages. However while reading the book I have come across highlighted and underlined pages. Not many, certainly not enough to go through the hassle of returning it. But it wasn't ""new"" only ""like new.""However, it is a wonderful book and, though the more I read the more I don't think I have a true ""strong-willed child,"" it is providing excellent, Christian based, parenting advice and humor."
1,My parents used this book,"I'm a college student now and my parents used this book to raise me. I suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome and will have flashbacks of my mom and dad being so incredibly angry and hitting me so hard my heart felt like it was about to burst. Dobson and every other parent who hits their child- you can call it spanking, whipping, smacking, whatever- should be in jail. My parents would also constantly tell me to stop ""being defiant"" and when I was a child I didn't have a clue what that meant. I will take my parents money but as soon as I'm independent they can go to hell. Avoid Dobson and go with Dr. Spock"
1,Excuse for Child Abuse,"My Mother read this book when I was a kid. It was just a justification for allowing my step-father to abuse me. I obeyed out of fear with a strong hatred. They always found something wrong with me, no matter how hard I tried. I never gave up my will, I just had to wait for my 18th birthday. I left home as soon as I could, and have been healing the trauma they inflicted on me. I refuse to speak to my step-father. I only speak to my Mother because she apologized for putting her needs over mine and giving me a rotten childhood. I am extremely willful today. All those years of forced obedience were enough for a lifetime, thank you very much. I'm an atheist too, even though my parents brought me to church every week. Science has a lot of evidence to show that physical punishment is not helpful. So, if you don't want your kid to grow up to be a rebellious, atheist adult who hates your guts DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
1,AVOID THIS BOOK!,"As a Christian (ordination track) and parent of three, I cannot recommend this book. Our second son was VERY difficult and this book was not only unhelpful to us, but the pinching the shoulder trick bordered on abuse! We found better, more positive ways to reach our son, who is now relatively well-adjusted and with a strong faith of his own.Nothing against Dr. Dobson, but do not buy this book!"
5,the strong willed child,"I read this book 20 years ago when I needed advice on how to handle my strong-willed son. James Dobson is great when it comes to giving advice on discipling your child and I have over the years recommended this book. I am Linda C Dipman, the author of ""The Game of Life It's Almost Over"". His book applied with the game of life makes a great combination because you understand how important it is to discipline the strong willed child. Our children must be tools for God. Great revisions James, keep up the great work. I have passed your book on to my children for their children."
2,Focus Please??,"My sister purchased this camera and returned it after a week for the 4MP Canon Elph. It looks stylish, but the picture quality is dreadful. The photos looked about as good as her old 2MP Fuji and were often completely out of focus. Also there is no optical viewfinder and the LCD screen is very difficult to see outdoors when it's sunny due to glare. The user interface is also diffuclt to use. Buy this phone if you want something pretty to show off and don't care about picture quality."
2,not up to olympus standards,"flash is very weak and pictures that are not closeups are blurry and grainy and the battery life is so weak that you can not rely on it. I can barely get 1 hour of shooting maybe 40 pictures so make sure you buy at least a second battery. The LCD is visually only good for shooting in daylight. I bought this as a second camera to put in my pocket, but am getting rid of it and look for something better."
4,Great camera to shove in your pocket,"I've stayed with Olympus cameras ever since my first digital one. Of of the 5 different models used, I prefer this one over the others. I owe a blue one and a black one.Pros:-it's compact-uses rechargeable battery-lightweight-takes very decent pics for the megapixelsCons:-there are times when the shutter slides back and forth as though it's seizing. I have to turn it off and on several times before it works. Not an always problem but it crops up frequently-rechargeable battery (I travel out of the US often and it can be difficult and time consuming waiting for the batteries to charge)I definitely recommend the camera. It's been good for all the pictures I've taken on my various travels."
3,"High style, low performance; short life","I finally got the ""card cover open"" error that so many other users have gotten (see various web forums). That means I can no longer use the camera.No great loss. I was getting pretty marginal results with it anyway. As a former E100RS owner, I was looking forward to excellent photos from the Olympus lens and CCD. But it was not to be, the lens/electronics combo is so slow that you need some sort of camera support or bracing for indoor, non-flash shots. Granted, this is just a simple pocket camera, but as such, it's a disappointment. Not up to the Olympus standard, IMO."
1,You're Better Off with a Disposible.,"I think the designers of this camera spent so much time making it look cute and slick that they forgot to actually try it out.I returned mine in 3 days. It was the biggest piece of junk I've ever bought. The picture quality stunk. My old 2 MP Sony took pictures 10 times crisper. There were problems with the focus. The flash was weak. It'll illuminate your subject's face, but forget about background. Indoors, the backgrouund will come out all black. It's garbage.If you're considering buying this camera, you're better off choosing something of comparable price with your eyes shut."
4,Great pocket camera,Great knock around camera. I expected quality of pictures to be better for a 4MP.
4,"In responce to ""Digital Photographer""","First, Olympus as a company does not sell any of the verves cameras at a seprate price structure. The Prices venders pay for the cameras are exactly the same, so if you see different prices for different colors then the vendor is setting those prices. Just look at Amazon every color is the same price. As far as bad picture issues my Verve is great! The pictures are awesome and look really good on the LCD screen. Compaired to some of these small LCD screen cameras, I can see everything in great detail. I really dont se how you could take a bad picture with this camera. Plus, as far as awkwardness, I find the camera very easy to use. I can take a picture and zoom in and out and switch between movie picture and play back modes with one hand! Im again dont understand how it could be awkward when everything is so easy."
2,An exile's appologia !,"A poor ""Euro-mimicry"". An inferior recreation of the Joycean creek(witness the parallel he draws conciously or unconciously between ""G"" and Stephen Dedalus).He has simply rebaptised Stephen in Black waters.Needs to be reconceived not through the kaleidoscope of racial baises, but through the very essence of art.This is a bannering of existentialist canvas that can hardly feed upon life. No doubt such is the dream of the caliban:The coward's paradise."
3,"""Rollerball"" review","I had been wanting to see this movie for years, and could never find it on video. After seeing the preview of the new Rollerball, My husband rented this 1975 film starring James Caan as the Rollerball champion< Jonathan.It's set in the future, as the filmmakers of the 70's saw the future, which is very archaic by today's standards. Basically, the film is the Rollerball tournaments, very 70's parties, and a lot of James Caan, which is fine by me. And some sort of mind bending drugs that make everyone behave a certain way, or at least the way that John Houseman wants them to.Caan turns in a great performance as always. Is it worth watching? I'd say so. It had a few slow parts, but the acting and storyline keep you interested enough to see it through to it's very fitting ending."
4,this was the first one,"the other ""Rollerball"" isn't even worth the name of 're-make' I'd say it was just the same old soup warmed over, typical Hollywood repetion as opposed to imaginative script writing."
3,"Great movie, not so great DVD","I'm not going into precise detail what's in the movie, since many before me have already done that. There are areas where the movie appears to lag, such as many of the scenes where Jonathan E is wandering around, sitting down, and staring at the wall. Other than that I really enjoyed the movie.The DVD however, was not so enjoyable. The images were very grainy and it looks like there was not attempt to clean the picture up. The sound is okay for a movie released in the mid seventies, with excellent classical music.I believe I'm going to purchase this DVD for my father, since he enjoys these kinds of movies."
2,"Wanted to like it, but couldn't.","Not good.Soylent Greenoffers a better rendering of futuristic corporation-run society, andThe Running Manhits the sweet spot of ultimate reality gaming. Either one is a more satisfying film experience than Rollerball; you could even make it a double-feature.Blade Runneris of course the classic dystopian vision.Fans of James Caan will be better served byThief. Here he seems less sure of Jewison's direction, less sure of himself, even. On the other hand, John Houseman (""They make money the old fashioned way...they earn it."") is quite good.Nice reduction in ambient nose in the championship game, but it's too little, too late, in my opinion. Tons of worthless dialog and plenty of unanswered questions. Maybe I'll give thebooka try sometime."
3,Better than the remake.,"Lot of action....good for the time period. This movie was copied alot so you know it has at least SOME substance. I'm not a huge James Caan fan but its funny to see him play an action star. If youve seen it before then hey, why not, go ahead and buy it."
3,a dvd only with director's commentary?,"i never realized this dvd was only dubbed with director's commentary blahblahblah from end to end, and it's so annoying to hear the director's reminiscent self-important voice over the dialog. this is not a big deal movie especially re-released today. i've tried to find if there's another category that i could avoid the voice-over commentary but, no, only his voice covered every scene. this is so bad, because all i wanted was to reminiscent the 70s movie by myself not by the director himself. sorry, man, this is not what i wanted."
2,Interesting but not valuable,Way to much money for an iconic movie. I would not choose to watch a movie like that in the future.
4,A good but not great movie,"""johnathan jonathan"" the crowd screams James Cann plays the leadinig role in the movie. this movioe is about the corparation CEOS owning the world this has essitial part to the plot but all the gore and violence are also essintil in this movie."
4,Today's movie,"This movie is as good today as it was when it first came out; and given its message of corporate rule, even more relevant. The last time I saw this movie was some 20-25 years ago. Back then I thought of it more as an action film. Not now. WOW. There's so much in this film that speaks to where we're headed: Corporate rule, violence as recreation, a pill for every mood. The 2002 remake wasn't. THIS is the one to watch. They should pull it out again for the big screen. All I have left to say is watch it!"
1,MGM (Fox) Where is the SE already? It's been out in Japan for YEARS!,Japan has a nice anamorphic version with extras. Where is the R1 already????
1,Rollerball,I bought the DVD and it doesn't work on my (U.S.)computer DVD player. All my other DVD titles are from Warner Bros. & work fine. This is the only one I bought from MGM and it crashes before the movie starts. I e-mailed MGM about this. They have not answered. WB includes software to make sure their DVD's run fine but I guess MGM can't be bothered.
3,Good but forgettable...,"Nice, psychadelica mid-tempo jangly-rock tunes are catchy with nice hooks, good lyrics and the lead singer has a unique voice that perfectly matches the music. But this album is immediately forgettable once you finish it. You will never think of any of the songs again (except Sister Surround). They all sound the same and it is mostly bland-texture sounds. So an entertaining music disc, but certainly not great."
5,Soundtrack Of Our Lives,"I just got 'Behind The Music' by Sweden's Soundtrack Of Our Lives, and it's actually very good. Think of a swirling stew of influences blended together to concoct something palatable, aromatic, and biting. Everything combined creates something completely different. You have your 60's influences like psychadelia and late period Beatles; 70's rockers like The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd. And hell, I even detect a bit of Britpop...all under one sparkling/melodic groove-oriented framework. And like most stews, although you know the recipe ahead of time, once it hits your tongue, the intoxicating sensation is more powerful than the sum of it parts. You might know the ingredients, but oh, it tastes so good."
2,Bring Back Union Carbide!!!,"I originally got interested in this band when I found out that some of the members were from Union Carbide Productions, a mid-80's heavily Stooges influenced band who's album ""In the Air"" was a classic. Since 1st albums are usually the best, I decided to try ""Welcome to the INfant Freebase"". It was definitely NOT Union Carbide sounding, however, I was not disappointed; it had a sound and style very unique....hard to describe, really....almost like a heavier Pink Floyd circa ""Piper""...not as trippy. Anyway, since I did enjoy it, I thought I'd try this new one out. And this one is a big letdown. The problem is, it just doesn't ROCK!! Where's the rock?? Every tune is just a slow acoustic number, almost like listening to an Eagles record. The volume and quirky aggression of the first record are gone. It honestly put me to sleep. Now, I gotta go dig out my old Union Carbide albums and burn them to CD for some real good listening..."
3,"Good music, bad vocals/lyrics","The music sounded great, however I feel the music could be much better suited to a different/better vocalist. I also felt that the lyrics were composed of trite dribble only acknoledged as satisfactory by prepubescent children (Example: tan as a ham). 3-4 songs stand on their own, which barely merits purchase of this album."
4,Real mom and real daughter face life toughest battles,"I was amazed at the honesty of the author's words. As a parent of a daughter with CF , this book helped me understand my issues with my daughter. I was pleased to see that it was a book about real people, not all a perfect fairy tale. It made me think about things from a patient's perspective, and made me feel understood as a parent that has my days of suffering along with my daughter when she is ill. There is alot of religion in the book but I found it to be uplifting when I was given the example oof how Peg's extraordinary faith helped get her through. I wish I knew her but I thank her mother for this gift of her daughter for us all."
4,Nice story,I enjoyed this book although most was quite sad. This disease is so tragic but it was nice hearing about a woman who fought so long and hard. She had a huge will to live.
2,The quality is not very good,I actually bought this dvd at a dollar store for $1 and that is all it is worth. buy the following two cartoons instead:loony tunes Golden collectionclassic cartoons B00063QD6G
3,"piano wizard, pretty good","This is a good program for practicing manual dexterity with the piano notes. It does not do chords much in the early lessons and there does not seem to be any way to integrate a child' music lession into the game. But it is good practice for playing notes. Using this keyborad with another program, music ace, is also helpful for the beginning piano student. Of course a music teacher is still important. I'm sorry that I bought the premier version in addition to the easy version. The premier does not have a lot of the features of the easy version and you have to download their versions of songs, limited availablity."
2,this is really just a game and not a very good one,"I purchased this software hoping to get some basic instruction and have a little fun. Its very lacking in both areas. The graphics are circa 1990, and the basic premise is find the key and hit it -- find the key and hit it -- find the key and hit it. Its more like that game where you bash the gophers as they come out of the hole than a learning experience.The interface is setup with ""lessons"", but these are just a selection of the song you want, and the colors of the notes, orientation of the keyboard, etc. There are no real ""lessons"", its point and shoot from beginning to end.Having spent the money I am now in a position of having to research some software that teaches. At least the keyboard that cam with it is OK.If you looking for something fun and educational, this is not it."
1,no support from m-audio,"Never had opportunity to try the product. E-mails (9) requesting help to m-audio and support@allegrorainbow were either never answered or took over four days and resulted in no help. Calls to m-audio resulted in being put on hold immediately, then put on hold for tech support with no results . The calls were never picked-up. I left my name and phone number on three separate occasions and never received a return phone call. This has been going on since 1/12/08. The company does not care and does not back it's product. They delayed so that the opportunity for return has passed.Piano Wizard for PC With 49E Keystation"
5,fun way to learn the basics,"My kids as well as my husband love this piano. It is a good way to tell if your child will be interested in learning piano and getting the basics down. It won't replace lessons but it is a good place to start. Even if they aren't bound for piano greatness, it is fun. The 49 key station is definately the way to go. The other would be too small."
2,"old, out of date software","This software may have been great back in its day, but it is falling quite out of date by now. It didn't work at all for me with Windows 7 64-bit. It just doesn't receive any signals from my keyboard, even after carefully re-installing the latest drivers from M-audio, etc. The same keyboard works just fine in several other programs that I have installed, so there is no excuse for this.I would strongly recommend waiting for the release of Piano Wizard 2.0 before purchasing. And I wouldn't fall for the ""buy 1.0 now, get free 2.0 upgrade later"" offer either... I couldn't find any promises on the piano wizard website about when version 2.0 will be released. Elsewhere I found rumors of its impending release from over two years ago! Sounds like it will be out of date again by the time it's released?"
5,Perfect for ny needs,I had one of those old style roll up covers on a previous truck. This one installed in 10 minutes and just folds up right away if you have bigger items to put in back of your truck. We have had a foot of snow one night and it didn't bow at all. Great product!
5,I recommend,"For many years I suffered from depression, I hadmedical treatment but it did not solve my problems. Iread many books written by doctors, it seems they arefar away from the suffering person."
2,Not That Exciting!,"I purchased this for my son who was doing a presentation on Lions in his class. It was informational, but extremely boring. The background music was pretty lame.I needed it in a hurry and paid for an upgrade in shipping...and I'm sorry that I did!"
1,anyone notice this?,"while i intend to purchase this book, or at least some edition of an inter-linear greek-english new testament, i noticed in viewing sample pages that the word ""kristos"" (anglicized- christ) is not translated. i have been looking through interlinear new testaments and find the same problem. it seems to leave much to be desired, as even in modern greek, not to mention ancient, ""kristos"" simply means ""annointed"" being a greek translation of the hebrew ""mashyah"" (anglicized - messiah) we hear and read these anglicized words but never read what they mean in translation... what's the dealio yo?"
5,Good Interlinear NT Greek-English Bible,"Interlinear setup: See the scanned images in Amazon.comReadability: The book is highly readable, with clear and sharp font sizes and font types.Cover: The hardcover is very durable and thick.Pages: Thickness is about 1/3 of the thickness of a normal inkjet paper. The pages feel thin but feels strong enough for bible study.Cons: Lacks a table of Greek letters' pronunciation and construction. There's a concise Greek grammar but not enough to be used to study Greek."
5,The best Interlinear New Testament to this day,"Being a student in Greek, This New Testament Greek Interlinear Bible witht he NRSV translation has been a blessing during my studies."
4,New Greek-English Interlinear New Testament,"A good reference text for those who are discerning of New Testament translation. I consider some noun and verb translations as somewhat ""loose"" when compared with a Greek dictionary. Nonetheless, I believe still accurate as to scriptural meaning."
5,A good book!,"It is a joy to read passages from the NT, and than see the greek words. I have a Nestle Aland at home, but I prefere to use this because it is bigger and it is easy to find specific words."
4,as described,Just what i wanted...although it's the personal size so the words are somewhat smaller. But brand new excellent condition and fast shipping. no complaints!
5,Perfect for the price and purpose it was intended for!,"This is a handy book to bring to church, small group or even class as it has a durable hardcover, easy to read font, has some margin room for writing notes and has a nice, short intro on grammar.What I like is this interlinear uses the NA27 and the NRSV as an English translation. Even if the NRSV is not your preferred translation, it does stand well on it's own and is more towards a word-for-word translation than the NIV for example (I prefer the ESV, so the NRSV is not too much of a stretch for me).I do not think this book was written as a end-all translation but more so as a handy tool to be used in one's spiritual journey. With that said, I feel it is worth the price paid! Now if I could find an OT interlinear that is as nice to this, I would be thrilled, so please post any suggestions you might have."
4,"Good calipers, good price","These are not top-of-the-line calipers, but they are reasonably priced and appropriately accurate. I now have a few of these model. They are handy for reloading, but equally useful for taking detailed measurements of engineering and machined items. It's definitely worth having some around."
1,Unbelievable!,"If zero stars were an option I would do that! The roaster arrived today. It was not broken like several other buyers had indicated with their experience. However, after getting ready to use it I noticed that the lid does not fit the roaster. Not even close. The lid is clearly made for something different. Roughly the same size but totally different shape. Sending it back ASAP. I do not want another one from Amazon. I hope they get this straightened out with their supplier. Stay away from this item!"
1,Poor Quality and Workmanship,"I have purchased quite a few cast iron cookware over the years and this is without a doubt the worst. The finish goes beyond ""rough"" to actually uneven and globular. I cant fathom how any individual associated with their quality control allowed this to come off an assembly line. Plus, the lid doesn't even fit correctly and appears to be warped. This is the first time I have purchased a Bayou Classic and while I have been interested in other pieces from their product line, I seriously doubt I would ever purchase anything from their company again. Please don't waste you money on this piece of garbage, look elsewhere. My belief is that Bayou Classic is completely inferior to any other cast iron cookware out there."
2,not the best quality,"I ordered this oval roaster last year. The roaster was cracked, so I sent it back and reordered another one. It was fine, except for excessive wax coating on it ( Which I still haven't got it all off yet). The lid is defective on one side,as if a four inch slinder piece was broken off the side of it. I did keep it as I hate returning items and it is a good price.( I still use the old castiron cookware for almost all my cooking, as my mom did.)"
1,Thumbs Down On This Product,I'm a big fan of cast iron cooking but I probably won't use this roaster very much. I'm unhappy with the way the lid fits on the pot. There is no lip around the edge of the lid or a recessed area around the edge of the pot to hold the lid in place. The surfaces of the outer edges of both the pot and lid are flat and if the pot is tilted slightly the lid will just slide off. I've never seen this on any other cast iron cookware and I own many pieces of cast iron. I would not recommend this item.
5,CAN'T WAIT!,"We all thought this DVD pkg. wasn't going to get released! Thank you Buena Vista for picking it up. I can't wait to get it when it's released on July 20. We all know it will include the late John Ritter as Ben's dad...so that is maybe why they decided to press it for sale. Either way, 1,000's of Felicity fans worldwide thank you - including me. I can't tell you about how great the series is -- Season 3 will be a great add-on to my collection of Season 1 & 2. Let's now get a date set for Season 4. I watch the entire collection, back to back, day after day within one week from receiving it. You'll enjoy it too.I want to relive my college years (I'm 33) - How about you? Live them w/Felicity and the gang, over and over again. The tale sure speaks of life in a realistic and flawlessly acted, humourous way!Peace!"
4,Enjoyable,"Season 3 of Felicity finally gives us a chance to see Felicity and Ben as a couple, which of course is great. However, this season is much different from the others. From Julie's struggle with her dad's passing, Ben's father, Noel becoming ""Leon"" and Elena's ""Dr. McGrath"" issue to Avery obsessing over Ben, this season definitely gives you a real world view of college life drama. It is still an enjoyable Felicity season packed with a serious punch."
5,Lovvvvve Felicity!!!!!,"I can't wait for this DVD to come out!! I am still in shock that they ever took it off the air. It was the only show I ever made sure to watch each week. The WB screwed up when they let go of this one. It's the only show that was truly a work of art. Plus it was so real to life and you could totally see where they were coming from. Plus the triangle of Noel, Ben and Felicity was great. Incredible actors and incredible script. Too bad they let it go, they really had something. Good thing we can get it on DVD atleast. I wish they would sale 3 and 4 at the same time instead of making us wait. Anyway AWESOME show and can't wait to buy it. If you've never seen it, buy it you wont regret it!!!"
2,Slow service,It took awhile for this product to be delivered. It took almost 3 weeks before I received the DVD's. I was very disappointed.
5,I love Felicity!,"I think each season is better and better.Unfortuantely, I just got to the last DVD and it's totally defective!The first 4 were terrific, I don't know why this one is damaged.The docuventary is REALLY bad-- I can't see or hear anything!Well-- I ordered a replacement one and that should be okay, I hope.Did anyone have probs with theirs?I still love Junior year and I can't wait for Felicity and Noel to have their summer!!!"
5,Looking forward to season 3,"I missed most of this season because the WB is a only available on satellite and digital cable in Canada and our local station decided (stupidly in my opinion) not to run the show during the regular season, opting instead to run it in the late spring and summer when I was out of town. I've seen a few episodes but most of them I've missed so I'm looking forward to seeing them. This was such a great show and so different than the cookie cutter shows that have become the norm. (...)"
5,The Best!,I cannot get enough of Felicity! I've watched and re-watched this series for years and look forward to sharing it with my kids someday. Highly recommend!
5,Felicity Rocks,"I have been a faithful Felicity fan since it first shown on the WB in 1998! I have been waiting years to get the DVDs and believe anyone who buys this series, will not be disappointed! Can't wait for the Senior year DVD, so my collection will be complete! Felicity was a wonderfully fun and realistic show, of which I haven't found any other show that could match it!"
3,Worth the wait,"Ok people, if u were thinking do i? or dont i? buy series three on DVD, well DO ITThe extra feature ""Docuventary"" by Greg Grunberg makes it all worthwhile.All the characters talking about all the episodes - very cool and kinda enlighteningSure it's not as strong drama wise as the previous series but is it better than what's on TV now? of courseIt's a long weekend down here in sydney and i know what i'm doing!(...)John"
5,Felicity Rocks,"When Felicity first aired, I tried to watch it. I remember the original intro was a Madonna song. At the time, I was already watching shows like Charmed and Dawson's so I didn't keep up with it. After I graduated college in Dec. 2002, I began watching the reruns on WE. I went through a really tough time after graduation and Felicity really helped me cope- despite how cheesy that sounds. :) Bottom line, Felicity is a show the means a lot to me and whether you are or were a college student or not, you will enjoy it b/c of the humor and the characters that you come to care about.This is one of my top 5 shows ever!"
5,Rick and Arlene are the best!,"I bought this book and took a pressure cooking class at Arlene's school in Wayne, NJ - Adventures In Cooking. She and Rick Rodgers are really the experts when it comes to pressure cooking. The recipes in this book are wonderful - my favorites are the risottos. I still can't believe that risotto could be so easy - only 8 minutes and no stirring! I'd recommend this book to anyone who hasn't the time to spend in the kitchen, or just likes great food prepared quickly. And if you're in NJ, check out the pressure cooking classes at Adventures In Cooking and see Rick and Arlene together in person."
3,pressure cooling for everyone,"an average cook book, doesn't cover more than the basics.... Did not cover things like pressure frying"
5,"Good Solid Recipes, GREAT!","I have found all the recipes in this book very good and tasty, easy to make and with ingredients that are easy to find. Some are fairly basic (beef stew) with a nice twist; others a little more exotic,things I never would have thought of. All in all for the low price I paid here on Amazon, I am VERY happy. Love the book and my new pressure cooker!"
3,A little bland....,I bought this book because it was one of the books highly recommended in the pressure cooking internet group that I am in. The book is beautiful but kind of bland in taste. It goes to show that you can never judge a book on its cover. I was kind of disappointed with the purchase. I recommend any of Lorna Sass's books. I own all of her books and everything tastes just right and is pretty easy to use.
4,Pressure cooking recipes,Purchased this cookbook to learn how to cook with a pressure cooker. Best move I ever made. Food comes out delicious in half the time of conventional cooking. Meat comes out so tender and vegetables are perfect.
5,Love the cookbook,This book has great recipes. I use it with my Cuisinart electric pressure cooker. I Would highly recommend it to anyone who has a pressure cooker!!!!!
3,nice book just not my cup of tea,This is a very pretty book however the recipes seem fancier than what I was looking for. I was looking for more of a homestyle or meat and potatoes type book. I will still keep the book as I see there about 3-4 recipes I may use. I recommend going to a bookstore first and skimming through all the pressure cooker books. And then come back to Amazon to buy what you like since its cheaper on amazon. I should have done that first but I do like the book enough not to return it.
4,Pressure cooking for everyone.,"I am a beginner, and haven't had a chance to try many from the book, so it hard for me review.it is very clearly written and illustrated.I will make more recipes during the winter months, I am sure, as it is the middle of summer here in Australia."
2,Not for families,"I was very dissapointed when I received this book. There are a lot of unusual recipes that kids just would not eat, nor would a meat and potatoes man. As for me, I'd say that I wouldn't even waste my time trying some of the recipes...just a little too ""off the wall"" for our taste. Many recipes call for expensive or seasonal items, too. I'm returning my copy..."
3,"Good idea, disappointing production values",This movie offers an interesting story and engaging actors but it let down by the lack of film making techniques. I guess the producers didn't have enough resources to realise their visual. A shame because this could have been a great movie. I was disappointed and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.
1,Do not waste your money!,This movie has a good concept but I think I could have made a better movie t home myself. This movie is not worth renting much less buying. I was very disappointed!
1,"Production much to be desired, Save Your money.","I bought this DVD because it was shot in Selma, Alabama. But this movie looked like a bad drama on one of the lesser networks to me or possibly a home movie of some amatuer. I understand the budget was low, but it would had been better to save the interesting story for a good make someday. I suffered through watching this and it seems all the scenes took place in one field and one house. It could have been much better with more camera shots, multiple viewpoints, Changing scenery, camera zooms, etc."
3,BEWARE!,"The titles listed are not that of this album. The titles listed are from the Atlantic issue of ""Comin' Home Baby."" This album is a compilation of ""hits"" from other albums."
4,Weaver Rimfire Scope,"I purchased the Weaver Rimfire 4X28 Riflescope to mount on a Marlin 795 .22 lr. I felt the slim, lightweight design particulairly suited it for the Marlin's sleek platform. I chose the matte finish which compliments the finish on the Marlin nicely. What really matters though is it's performance. I find it to perform better than other competitively priced models while still retaining all the features one associates with the long Weaver tradition. It isn't the finest scope money can buy but is priced accordingly. Windage and elevation adjustments are easy and concise. It was quick to sight in and has held true since. It's a fine value for it's price range and in my mind superior to others in it's price range."
3,"Need air valve control, weight","This is great looking decoration but the ""action"" doesn't work (the lid doesn't go up and down) unless you can adjust the air flow, which means you need an air valve control. Plus, it won't stay level; it rises up from one side regardless of air control."
5,"Nice, but needs an air flow valve","This little chest works great, however make sure you get or have an air flow valve to cut down the airflow to this. I have a separate bubbler and this chest. The air opening in the chest is large so all of the air comes out of it and keeps the lid open, and no air flowed to my bubbler until I put a small valve to turn the flow down. Now it works like a charm."
4,"Too light to stay in place, but cute when weighted down","This is a great looking ornament, but takes some time to make it work.1- The treasure chest is too light. It will not stay in place. What makes it even more important is in order for the moving lid to work, the chest should be placed in a horizontal position. And without taking care of the light weight, it would move very easily and the moving lid would get messed up. We weighted the chest down by putting two gravels inside it.2- You should really have an air valve to control the flow of the air to the chest. That way you cal also adjust the frequency in which the lid opens.** Overall: great-looking, and really fun to watch, but takes some patience to set up and secure it."
4,"Cool concept, if it worked properly...","I love the idea of the diver going up and down as the treasure chest opens and closes. Unfortunately, the chains attaching the diver to the chest are cheaply made, so the diver came off and I had to sort of rig him so he stays attached to the chest. Due to the rigging, he doesn't go up and down when the chest opens and closes."
2,action treasure chest,"I would love it if it worked. Still trying but so far, Action Air Treasure Chest & diver has no action except a few bubles!"
2,diver,it takes too much air pressure to activate it. only a pump higher than 10 pounds will work it. also has no action.
1,"JUST A GENERIC BIOGRAPHY, NOTHING INTERESTING","A huge disappointment, no live footage of Rachmaninoff, nothing but a short biography. 30 minutes only. A waste of money."
1,False Advertising! AVOID!,"It is claimed that this video shows footage of Rachmaninoff, and it was primarily for this reason that I bought two copies (one for another pianist friend). Moreover, Rostropovich is supposed to be the primary contributor with Alexis Weissenberg also participating.Nothing of the kind! There is no Rachmaninoff footage, no evidence of Rostropovich or Weissenberg. Instead, it is an amateurish 30 minutes of facts and photos gleaned from biographies.I am asking for my money back!"
1,IT IS VERY SHORT,This DVD work is not good. The content of it is very short and the subtitles are not available. The spoke opcions are only for russian and english.
2,IT'S RACHMANINOV! Not Rachmaninoff.,"I only have to rectify - for your reviewers - the huge but deep-rooted mistake: this RUSSIAN composer's name should be transliterated from Russian as RACHMANINOV, or even better - RAKHMANINOV and not with this obsolete old-fashioned French-inspired ending ""-off"". Please, please let's collectively return to this great man and the greatest composer his true identity! And let's continue enjoying his great music!"
1,Not Good,"I bought this for my Mom for Mothers Day. She had just gotten this phone and I wanted to get some accessories for it. When she tried to put the phone on it, it would not fit. The phone does not fit in the slot. So she cannot use it and I have to return it."
1,AVOID!,"This dvd seemed like a nice Christmas gift. I really dont know why I got it, but it was probably a dollar speical. The thing that bothered me was the orignal theme song was cut out! HOW COULD THEY DO THAT?!? I can understand paying royalitys, but COME ON!"
2,Wretched production,"Lucrezia Borgia, while not one of Donizetti's best operas with a rather dopey libretto, is well worth hearing but not in this poor production. The camera work is at best routine, and tends to reveal the weaknesses of the staging, the stolid nature of the acting, and the rather inappropriate casting from a visual point of view of the two female leads. The subtitles are farcically incomplete and there is no libretto or any other useful information. Yes, the singing is distinguished, and Anne Howells is a delight, but as a whole this is highly disappointing. Since this DVD is not worth watching, and Lucrezia Borgia is given a much better performance in the 1977 recording (still available on CD transfer) with Sutherland and Bonynge in better form than here and with Aragall, Horne and Wixell vocally at least as satisfying as Krause, Howells and Dean, only a very devoted Donizetti fan will want this DVD. I shall not be watching it again."
3,Review of Lucrezia Borgia CD,Video quality was poor. The DVD could not process the last part of the opera. The picture remained frozen.But singing was excellent. Joan Sutherland is exceptional.
2,just not as pictured,When i saw this bypass toe ring i was really impressed! It looked thick and just what i had been surching for.Well when i got it in the mail i was so disapointed!!! It is very prety but the gold is so thin that it would snap if it got caught one time! That is a real problem for me. I wear my toe rings 247. For that kind of momey i excpect a lot more.
5,One of the best of its kind!,"I LOVE this book, and try to read at least one reflection daily.... more often, if necessary to re-center myself. What I love most is that the reflections are the perfect length, and get to the point in very realistic, down-to-earth fashion. While I appreciate the occasional biblical references, sometimes I need to hear concrete ideas that I can relate to and that I can apply, in my own mind, at that moment. I will read this book over and over again, because even though they're the same readings, they touch my heart differently in each unique situation or frame of mind that I find myself in."
2,treat with caution,"This book should be treated with caution. It is unedited and self published, and takes a totally phonological approach, which research has shown to be unsuitable for all but very mind cases of dyslexia. It does show some similarites to Alpha to Omega, which I would recommend as a general guide to teaching dyslexics and which has been endorsed by Dyslexia Action in the UK, but is really not in the same class."
2,"Do the job, but poor quality","The title pretty much sums it up. Nice and round, but so flimsy. The weight of the metal is like aluminum foil that has been triple folded. I'd prefer something with enough weight to cut through a raisin for example, when cutting cookies or biscuits."
5,"Cut Sandwiches, Cookies, Pastries, Rolls....",This set of round cutters is perfect. The sizes are great - all three sizes are what you will need to make a variety of circle shapes when cooking. They also work for cutting sandwiches into nice little round shapes.Great buy!
3,Cutters,"They seem to be okay, however they are not sized properly. The three inch cutter is not quite the three inches that it was advertised to be as I found it to be a bit smaller. But they seem to work alright."
1,CHEAP,these cookie cutters are so cheap they look like they were made by a teenager in shop class. the handles aren't even attached to the cutter! cheap cheap.
5,Baking Made Fun With These Cute Cookie Cutters Kids Love Them,These cookie and biscuit cutters make the day in the kitchen so much more fun. They are easy even for small hands to grip and they make the perfect circle design that you want. Stainless steeel quality workmanship makes them even better. They are dishwasher safe and I wish I had a ton of them. Put some fun back into your baking with the kids by using these creative cutters.
3,These Will Do the Job,"Got this set for my wife as she was beginning to make homemade buttermilk biscuits. We only needed the biggest one, but the set was cheap enough for all three sizes. These work fine, but don't press down too hard---I bent the curved handle and nearly broke it off. If you use a gentle touch (which really is all you need for cutting dough) then these will do the job. Would give it a higher rating if they were a bit more indestructible."
4,clay pot meyer lemon tree,"Although many leaves had falllen off by the time this tree was deleivered, the tree has made a rebound and seems to be sprouting new leaves. It also aquired some blossoms and has a delicious light sweet smell. The company that sent the tree was very helpful when I called to report the barness of the tree--they reassured me this was ok and that new leave would soon appear and if not, the plant was guarenteed for a year. I would reccomend this item."
2,Where's the **MUSIC**??,"I bought this for my daughter because she loves Disney's Beauty and the Beast and I wanted her to be able to listen to the music without sitting in front of the TV (watching the video). Well I was mightily disappointed! The read-along includes an abbreviated version of the story ONLY, no songs, not even one! The story has a narrator and audio clips from the film so the quality is fine, but in my opinion it's a bit of a waste of money without any of the wonderful music from the film!"
4,Great tool for Bible study,"A good little book that asks you a lot of detailed questions, which makes you dig into your Bible for answers. Worked good for our group."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought a Timex Nutrition Manager and it worked great for about 2 weeks. During that time I bought two more as gifts for my dieting buddies. None of them worked longer than 2 weeks! I even bought new batteries trying to get them to work. The concept is great, but they don't work so it is worthless. What a disappointment. I had always liked Timex."
3,you get what you pay for,"I love this calculator, but its true that its not the best device. It takes me three or four pushes of the button to turn it on and there is something rattling around inside. But all in all, I would recommend it. I actually thought I lost it, and ordered a new one right away. It has enough foods listed for me, and it's easy to add new ones. I only keep track of caloric intake, but you can do fat, fiber, etc. But, you're def not going to get a $80 device for $10!"
1,disappointed,I bought this nutrition calculator to replace another I had for a long time but recently lost. I was disappointed that the new one is more difficult to use. Additionally the product seems to be defective. Sometime when the buttons are pushed it works fine but at other times nothing happens. I bought a new battery soon after it arrived thinking this was the problem but that did not fix it. I think if the buttons worked correctly I would be more apt to spend the time learning how to use all the features but right now it is just gathering dust. Sharon Houghtling
1,disappointed on a timex name,the picture of the nutrition manager looked very easy and doable. But after I received it and tried to set it up it broke and was totally unusable. I was very frustrated with it and threw it out. I do not recommend this item to anyone who wants to keep count of food calories.
1,Piece of Junk,"I received this product and it didn't work properly. I believe it came with a near dead battery, as that plastic thing they have wasn't really in the right place. The off-on button doesn't work, the display is very small, only shows half of what is on the screen. Then again, that may be due to the near-dead battery. Although low battery does not show up on the display anywhere. I didn't save the original packaging... I mean, who can save that type of packaging when it takes a jack hammer to open up one of those stupid plastic sealed boxes? My only hope is to maybe try to get another battery, if that doesn't fix it, then it's in the trash and a lesson learned."
1,waste of money,"This product is a waste of time, confusing and not easily used.It was bought and passed around the family. I have found none that cared for it."
1,junk timex nutritiion manager diet,Junk this worked about 1 hour I even hit reset and lost the LCD screen. This is a brand new battery. Save your money and a headace. I am returning this for a full refund. JUNKTimex Nutrition Manager
1,Junk,Ordered 3 of them. Only 1 worked on arrival. The one that did work was a real chore to use. Back to a written log for me. Amazon was great about returning them for me.
2,Not too good...,I usually am always happy with my Aviation book choices but this one was not what I hoped for; too many stories and not enough facts; it was boring so I returned it to Amazon. Hopefully one day I will find the B-52 book I am looking for.
3,Substandard sonics....historic nonetheless,"If you're a deep fan you won't be bothered by the bootleg qaulity of the tracks. Iggy's speaking voice is heard among the music culled from 1973 and 1974 gigs. Bass is strong, audience resonates.It appears that the famous photo seen on the Live In Michigan CD is taken from the '73 show herein. Please correct me if I'm wrong.Some hideous, some beautiful photography in the booklet.Prince...bend an ear, baby."
2,Cajun,"The CD arrived just fine, but the music is boring. Like ""Easy Listening"" Cajun music. I won't listen too much because it sounds so ""canned."""
4,The 112 album was the best thus far,I have all but good things to say about this 112 album when they are singing I feel that they are singing to me. They now how to express there feelingd towards a women very beautyful way. I will always be a 112 fan forever. Sean Combs did a wonderful jobs with these guys.
2,Be sure to get Equipment Protection,"I recently purchased this phone and everything was working fine. The phone was then accidentally dropped from less than one foot and the screen has gone black through the middle. If you do purchase this phone, be sure to buy the extra equipment protection with it as the screen cannot handle any pressure other than from the stylus or fingernail. Good luck."
1,Don't make the same mistake I made by buying this LEMON,"I purchased a PalmOne Treo 600 from VerizonWireless in Sept. 2004, content that I could finally ""converge"" my PDA and cell phone into a single device. WHAT A TERRIBLE MISTAKE THAT WAS!Soon after my purchase but unfortunately after the 15-day return period, I found the Treo 600 to shut itself off randomly, often in the middle of phone calls. I brought the phone back to the store and was told that I needed to contact the Verizon tech folks about my problem. The Verizon tech support team sent me one replacement phone after another but they all had the same problem. Finally it was determined that there is a software bug in the SMS application which causes a hardware failure for the device. An Verizon network engineer informed me that there is nothing they can do until a software patch is released. I am now on my sixth replacement phone and I still can't use this LEMON. Save yourself some headaches and buy something else."
2,Bad Things,"Love the PDA features, but the phone is awful. If battery is not fully charged it can not make calls. With a full signal and battery it drops calls or will not force its way on to Verizon's network. Ringer volume is fine but vibrate mode is weak. I teach and cannot always answer the phone... I'm going back to Verizon to see if I can upgrade or change over. Maybe the 700 is better."
3,"Decent product, but made for very tall women.","This simple stocking was just what I wanted. It's not fancy, but I wanted something just for work that I didn't have to worry about, and the price was excellent. However, these stockings are very, very long. Even raised as high as they could go on the belt, I still had about six extra inches at the toe. At 5 foot 5, I didn't expect this for an average size. I thought I was average! Good service and good price if you are tall enough to fit into them, though."
3,Very delicate,Despite all the care I took when putting them on they still broke a hole in the toe seam. These are almost one-use disposable stockings. But nonetheless still very pretty.
3,Fits well,"This product fits well and looks nice, the only thing is that the material is very thin and gets runs easily. You will probably only get a few wears out of it, but not bad considering the price."
2,Thigh High- White,"I ordered these in white. I was expecting them to need a garter, but they didn't. However, they weren't flattering. They're not lace top and I think the intention was for them to be worn with a garter. The tops dug into my legs and I had to cut them and fix them. More work than they were worth. They're also a very thin fabric, not high quality. Snagged easily."
4,"Good quality, great price","Purchased this item for a halloween costume, I ordered the One Size option. I guess my thighs are a bit bigger. Although I wear them with a garter belt, the sides roll down just a bit. I'm 5'3, 145lbs, Perhaps i just have thunder thighs. This by no means makes them unwearable, and they look great with my costume! Good buy!"
2,Don't Last,These stockings look good but don't last long. My wife wore them one time for 2 hours before they got a run in them. Next time will look for a better product especially after paying almost 15 for these you would think they would last longer.
1,Unsure about that above pic,The stocking were very lovely. The pic shows an elastic on the thigh area which is false. I bought these for my wedding and did not even open the package until the day of. I was very upset to learn that I needed the elastic straps to hold the stockings up.
4,ahead of its time,"This funny album sounds actual again. It perfectly fits with the current break 'n bossa and new jazz trends: simple uplifting funny melodies, perfect for a party when everybody is a bit tipsy. The music is mainly a combination between honky-tonk and techno, which sounds pretty refreshing. The music is very light without pretentions, just straight dance music suitable for parties. Do not look for 'deep intelligent' stuff, it's more like the Basement Jaxx type of no-nonse dancemusic. The package is something special: it's the 'worlds first analog cd-interactive boardgame!' Jelly good, indeed. In other words, if you don't like the music, you can still use it as a board game.... :-)"
5,Uplifting Happy and Bouncy,Great combination of synth sounds and happy and silly melodies with good dance beat! Love it! I've used the music from this album as a soundtrack for several home-made videos.
2,There's a better book,"Although this book about me came from a reputable publisher, it is chockablock with errors and misinformation. I had no idea of its existence until someone handed me a copy. It isn't hostile--just wrong in many issues of fact. I recommend instead the book by Ross R. Olney, which is far more accurate. My own autobiography, on offer by Sterling Lord of Sterling Lord Literistic of NY, awaits a publisher."
1,Misleading,"The title of the CD lead one to believe that this was a compilation of various artists singing their rendition of Blue Moon. In fact only the original version, sung by The Marcels, was present on the CD with various other songs. Over all, very disappointing."
2,A bit misleading,This 20 pin connector unfortunately only comes with 14 of the pins in place and 6 spots empty. To use it on my 2004 Honda S-2000 I'll need to buy two of these to piece together one that works properly since I need 16 pins for the OEM radio.
5,Must have for 2004 TSX,"Installing an aftermaket radio in the 2004 TSX is difficult, but it CAN be done. You need to use the factory MP3 player adapter that converts your storage pocket to an ""almost DIN"" size opening and use this reverse wiring harness teed into the other Metra harness to plug back into your factory radio, to retain power to light up your clock and HVAC panel. I ordered my stuff off of Crutchfield, and they made no mention of losing the displays or needing this harness. They did credit me $15 however, so I could buy this elsewhere. The system is now in perfectly, and as usual, the aftermarket radio blows the factory out of the water. The main reason was to get Ipod input, and while I was at it, HD Radio. Again, this is a must have harness."
3,"The Famous Cookery Cookbook,",Very ordinary. Not sure why this book with just average recipes commands such a high price in general for second hand books.
1,Who Told This Man He Could Sing?,"Who ever told this guy he could sing was obviously tone deaf! Listening to this CD reminds me exactly of what fingernails being scraped down a blackboard sounds like. And the ""lyrics""? Giovanni's obviously stoned out of his mind when he wrote them. They make no sense whatsoever. Who can relate to this pseudo psycho-babble nonsense? Thankfully, my copy of this CD was a ""gift"", given to me amid much laughter and ""You aren't going to believe this!"" sort of comments. Now I know what all the laughter was about. The only good thing I have to say about this ""piece of work"" is that the CD makes an excellent frisbee. My advice to Mr. Giovanni: don't quit your day job."
4,The Mechanoids Trilogy,"For those of you who've done RPGs before and know of Palladium Books' work, this is a good way to see how they got started. While i myself got the book mainly to do research into the Mechanoids for a little writing project of mine, i can see that Kevin Siembeida knew what he was doing on this book. While there isnt much detail on the individual types of mechanoids, it does give a general outlining needed to create a world being torn apart by alien invaders; after that, the rest is up to the players. It's a good book and i'd recommend it for anyone looking to get into playing Role-Playing games."
5,Sonny & Cher: I Got You Babe,Great! I finally got a copy of this cd! Always wanted to own one back then.It's still fun to listen now as when I first heard Sonny & Cher in the late 60's.
1,Still Not Arrived So Hard to Comment,I ordered the CD on 24 December 2007 and it was advised that it should be delivered around 17 January 2008 but as at today 23 January it hasn't arrived.
4,Jacky Cheung is an excellent Chinese Performer,"I personally am a big fan of Jacky's and really enjoyed the older hits on this album. In fact, those are the better ones that he's sang. Plus, why does it keep saying japanese title for the song listings? True he sings in Japanese sometimes, but...oh well. A must buy for your Chinese pop collection."
1,Boring -- too much about sex,"This book focused way too much on O'Hara's sex life and not enough on his work. The prose style is tedious, and I found myself skimming it through all the excruciating details about the poet's various lovers. The reader snoozes, O'Hara loses."
1,An Incredible Bore,"It's not surprising that Brad Gooch, a professional homosexual, writes a book that makes Frank O'Hara appear to be nothing more than another professional homosexual. Actually, Gooch may be right. O'Hara is an incredibly minor figure in American poetry, and this books devotes too much print to a third-rate writer who would probably best be forgotten."
3,BrainQuest is better,"Nothing wrong with this product, but the BrainQuest series is more interesting and engaging. If you're just looking for page after page of exercises, this does the trick."
4,3rd grade tutoring,"I use this book to supplement what the student learns in school. It covers many basic topics in reading and writing. It also covers some topics on science and social studies in the readings. However, there are not a lot of practice problems for some topics and too much practice for others."
4,Nice CD,"The previous reviewer must have listened to a different CD, as these are original recordings of Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles singing Christmas songs. A nice slice of 60's R&B for the holidays."
4,pretty good program to understand a bit of Thai,"I've used Pimsleur's program for Japanese and other languages and found it to be fairly effective, when combined with the study of grammar and other basics. This time I only used this program to learn Thai. Although I couldn't remember most of the sentences after arriving in Thailand, I still remember some of it 2 years later. I still couldn't understand people's conversations since it's not the complete program, but I could pick out a couple of words here and there."
2,A number of deficiencies,"The CD collection would be more useful if a leaflet of the most common phrases/sentences in phonetic Thai and English was included, particularly to understand how a sentence is constructed. I agree there are some unnecessary statements of the bleeding obvious, and the constant switching between male and female gender can be confusing.My major criticisms of the CD's are the male speaker sometimes pronounces a Thai word differently to the female speaker, and also that there are some words which are mispronounced to the point a Thai native cannot understand them.I was thinking of purchasing the more comprehensive Simon and Schuster Thai lessons ( $200 - $350 ). However, I believe the money would be better spent on having Thai lessons in Thailand. This basic Thai CD collection is probably suited to tourists who want to communicate with Thais on a very limited basis."
3,It is Adequate for an adult - But falls short of Excellent,"The Pimsleur method states that it doesn't have the learner repeat over and over, but that it will re-introduce a phrase right before your memory might forget it. In a sense, how a child learns.That's all well and good, I don't take exception to this. However, the adult who is not always in a position to be listening, may be able to glance at some word/phrase to review the pronouncing of the words from memory. This will accelerate that person's learning. The Pimsluer method falls short in this regard. Therefore, I believe this method is adequate but not excellent.David Fisher"
1,Can't Hear First Word or Sound in many sentences,"On my CDs, the first word or sound on many sentences is clipped or missing. So, a sentence like, ""Are you there,"" becomes ""You there?""I e-mailed Pimsleur twice, and both time they prmosed to get back in three to five b-days. They never got back at all."
3,So So,"Its OK and I give it an average rating. It's not as good as it seems at first. The Thai is spoke too fast with a lot of dead space between the spoken phrases, I assume to give you time to repeat. Also its text book Thai which is not what is really spoken in Thailand. So you end up wasting a lot of time trying to learn parts of speech you will never use and even the Thai's themselves don't use. I place this in the same category as many of other methods and courses. Too much time spent learning stuff you wont use. I'm still looking for something better."
4,Cute book for kids who get into trouble because of manners,This book can be for parents who want there kids to learn the responsibilitys of manners or it can be for kids who just want to have fun reading this book because they will get taught there manners but in a fun way. I think this book is great and how they used bunnys as an example of bad behavior is so cute.
3,naughty bunny book for kids,this book is good for little kids because it teaches them that they shouldn't be bad.it teaches thenm that when they are bad they get punished(well most kids do)but anyway the bunny gets into a lot of trouble and gets punished.
4,A lot Information in such a small space,It's almost better than having cheat sheet in school. More than 90% of the information you keep thumbing through the book for in on this double sided plastic 'Micro Chart'. Very helpful.
1,A fish called Wolfgang,"Seriously odd. All the piano pieces are lovely, um, apart from the sloshing water and the moaning sounds. Not my idea of meditation, but perhaps this will soothe the heart of any forlorn blubber processors rendered idle by the International Whaling Commitee's moratorium."
2,Utterly pointless,"While I was totally enchanted with Cupid and Psyche, I could not care less about the title characters: Aimee and... what's his name again? The book does contain some amusing scenes, but I would have rather seen more Cupid/Psyche romance."
3,A Mini Biography and Not a Book About the Trials,"Needless to say, as others have stated here, this book is NOT about the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. It is, simply, a book containing 22 mini-biographies of the major Germans who were tried at Nuremberg. However, some of the bios were quite good. Others were quite boring. The stories about Schacht, Funk, Von Shirach were uninteresting reading. But those on Kaltenbrunner, Hess, and Goering were good and kept my interest. However, only the last two chapters of the book (The Organisations and 20 Years Later) were exceptional. It is only these last two chapters that pull the men and their criminal pasts together. If you want to read about the actual trials, do NOT read this book. There are many others which do a MUCH better job discussing the day to day events of the trial than this book does."
4,The first gay friendly music company,"Its a CD featuring different pop songs from gay artists, it is a great opportunity for all these singers, in all there are good and not so good songs, but there are some that are really worth while like, so i think you wont regret it. And another thing, i believe its really great that gay artists are finally getting a chance to express themselves and they want to in their music, so in a way, its a good start..."
5,Great For A Beginner - Like Me,"When you live in a small town without ""Sanskrit resources"", THIS is a perfect book.I also suggest the Healing Mantras CD. I had never heard Sanskrit Mantra chants. They are wonderfully hypnotic and powerful.In this book, I learned about Seed Mantras (One Syllable) and the meaning of each.Healing Mantras shares Spiritual Wisdom.I Highly Recommend it."
3,Happy to have it,"I teach yoga,meditation and stress management and was exicted to get this book (and had read all the reviews saying to buy the cd as well). As someone with knowledge (not expertise) of Sanskrit, I find that I wont need the CD (while it would likely compliment the book nicely, not neccessary if you have a basic knowledge of mantras and sanskrit). I had hoped the book would have a magical ""draw"" whereas I'd not be able to put it down, but (& to the authors credit, he says, read some, put it down, come back a week later- and he's right)so far I'm not ""captivated"" by it. Am happy to have it though, the chants are applicable to life,situations we commonly experience and I see myself coming back to this book again and again to ""graze"". I am happy to have it on my side table. Nameste"
2,Description needs more detail,I wish Amazon would do better at defining their products and SEPARATELY break out the reviews. I read the reviews but did not realize I was only ordering the BOOK. It did NOT come with the CD. So now I'll have to place an additional order for the CD. Either offer the items together or make the reviews totally separate from one another. Don't lump the reviews into one.
5,The world is sound -,"This book offers a wonderful view into the world of using sound to heal the body, mind, and soul. It provides an excellent foundation for understanding the power of mantras.When I purchased this book (about four years ago), I had a lot of problems with my eyes. I used to get ulcers on my cornea, and no doctors were able to explain why this happened. I discovered a mantra in this book, dedicated to healing the eyes. After practicing this mantra for a few weeks, my eyes began to feel better. After a few months, my eye doctor was suprised to find a noticeable improvement in my eyesight. Since practicing this mantra, I've only experienced one more corneal ulcer (about two years ago).Since then, I've incorporated many of the mantras found in this book into my daily life.Peace be with you! Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti!"
3,Some question as to the correct pronunciation in the Ganesh Mantra,"""Om Gum Ganapatayei Namaha"" After researching online extensively,it seems that there is some question about Farrands pronunciation. Most information I referenced sais that the correct pronunciation is ""Om Gam Ganapatayei Namaha"" ""Gam"" being the bija sound for Ganesh. I then checked the Upanishads and indeed, the correct pronunciation is ""Om Gam Ganapatayei Namaha"" I spent 21 days chanting the ""Om Gum......"": and, after the research changed to ""Om Gam......"". In his book he places this Chant under :Resolving Inner Conflict"" On his CD Farrand states that this Chant is for resolving any obstacles in one's life. I find these inconsistencies a bit disturbing. I find myself double checking his pronunciations and use of Chants. My advice, Double check his work with other sources."
2,academic overview,"This is a classroom review of healthcare human resources. It lacks case examples of organization structures or design strategy in a hospital. It misses out on any review on performance management or metrics or balanced scoreboards. It misses out on workforce analysis and recruiting strategies, critical in an industry with shortages. From a business world perspective, this book is very limited in value in healthcare human capital management."
1,wrong plug for alternator,The plug didn't fit my alternator. It is for the map sensor. Amazon said it would fit. I guess I should have looked more closely.
2,not getting what you order,Placed order for one ball and got another totally different looking one. Sent back and got replacement. Got the same one that was wrong the first time. Picture on website not matching the part number so kept getting wrong ball. Decided to go somewhere else to order. Never had issue before but the customer service was very helpful in trying to get me the right ball but when not able they made sure it was pulled from the web site so it would not happen again and had no problems refunding my money. Only giving two stars for excellent customer service.
4,Brine Lobo Futsal Ball,"This product is great. Although the first one i received was lopsided, the seller promptly sent me a new one at no cost AND in time for our game in the following two days of the products arrival! The ball plays great, looks great, and is by Brine which is a great, quality soccer ball! I Would recommend this product!"
4,Brine Lobo Size 3 Soccer Ball,Brine Lobo Size 3 Soccer Ball meets all expectations. I use the ball for indoor soccer training for my high school team. This ball appears to have good durability and compares favorably to both Mikasa and Kwik Goal futsol balls that I have used in the past.
5,Perfect present,My daughter loved her ball. Shipped timely and arrived quickly. Daughter stated that it worked great at practice. Recommend for anyone working on their foot skills
5,Kettler is the best!,I recently purchased this swing set for our daughter. The quality of this product is superb. Kettler is well known for putting out a great product. It took about a half hour to put together. The colors are great. I wanted a swing set that was well made and safety was a concern. I am so happy with this purchase. It is expensive but worth every penny. It will get well used by our daughter.
1,"What nerve calling your show, ""Investigative Reports""!","How can a show call themselves, ""Investigative Reports"", when no investigation into this crime was ever done by your show? Your show was completely one sided. Why did you not speak with anyone from Tim's family? Why did you not speak with any one of the seven other Detectives that had worked this case and believe that they got the wrong guy? Det. James Broderick and then Prosecutor's, Jolene Blair and Terence Gilmore, went after Tim to further their own careers. If anyone out there wants to know the truth as to what happenned in the Tim Masters / Peggy Hettrick murder case, they won't find it on this video. They need to check out www.FreeTimMasters.com. This site will show how Broderick lied on the stand and put an innocent man in prison for life."
2,LG Stereo Headset,The headset is sleek. However the sound clarity is not that good. I guess the impedence of the headphones is slightly high.
3,My earphone purchase,The item did not work with my LG phone. The fitting was to small and it would not work with a adapter.
3,"It's a nice replacement, but not perfect.","Purpose: I purchased this item to replace my previous headset that produced very low sound volume.Pro: These headphones produce normal volume with one side on and exceptional with both sides on. There is also a volume adjusting wheel and call end/begin button on the microphone piece. The microphone, short side, and long side are all decent lengths.Con: The wire between the microphone and the plug end is rather short. I have to keep the device in a pocket on my upper body for the headphones to fit comfortably. The wire pulls down on my ears if I try to keep my phone anywhere below my belt, such as in my pants pocket. By no means am I too tall either, standing only 5' 7"".Marcus"
2,disappointed...,"I'm not sure what reason it is but this has not worked well since day one with my phone. Maybe its because I have an LG enV and it isn't compatible or whatnot but the microphone is horrible. The clarity of the 'phones is great but the microphone just doesn't work well at all. Every time I use this thing in the car people just can't hear me. I have to hold the mic up to my mouth just so that people can hear my voice, but even then all my friends tell me that the sound quality they hear is horrible. I would've thought thata gold tipped WIRED headset would be good clarity on the receiving end but this just isn't the case."
4,hmmm,"well its great to use your MP3 player. volume control on button part-easy access. HOWEVER!!!! very non durable. i dropped on the bud on the floor and the shiny part hit the floor and snapped off. howver, can be put back."
5,Lund 95084 Tonneau cover,I think in my opinion that this is one of the better toneau covers that are out there. Easy to install. You don't have to worry about any snaps. It looks great on my truck. Easy to fold up.
1,Money for nothing,"unfortunately, I opened this only to find two songs on it. It should have been advertised as such"
3,litter scoop,The item is interesting and I enjoy having a disposable bag at hand to throw away waste
5,High quality at an amazing price!,"Like ""Animals in the Wild"" this DVD is very good. The only better works are those BBC ""The life of Mammals"" and ""The life of Birds"" but if your a wildlife lover than these DVDs belong in your collection.The Wildlife Stories series consist of three DVDs - each DVD dedicated to two animals each. In this case spiders and beetles. Great closeup footages, lots of indepth info make this DVD very interesing. Compared to the only other DVD about insects ""Insectia"" this is ten times a better purchase."
3,"Misleading title, but fairly interesting anyway","Based on this book's title and short description, I was expecting ""tales"" of interesting or unusual animal behaviors or characteristics. Unfortunately, many of the chapters seemed to focus more on the people who study or hunt these animals than on the animals themselves. While many of the chapters were fairly interesting, little unique or fascinating information about the animals was presented. Finally, it was hard to consider some of the animals or their behaviors to be even faintly repulsive (e.g., a bull being used to film a TV commercial)."
2,Average at best,"I wasn't very impressed with this book in general. While I must admit much of the information is their, by and large I found it lacking when compared to other books of this genre.Search around some more, their is better quality out there."
4,"Very good book, avoids most of the pseudo-historical romance","Very good resource, excellent descriptions and images of pipes in museum's holdings. Covers pipes from around the world, includes historical information. Avoids most of the pseudo-historical drivel that often obscures the actual use and history of the Highland pipes, as well as revealing to many for the first time that there are bagpipes from places other than Scotland. All in all, an excellent book!"
5,Just Super,I bought this 1GB card for my Palm Zire 31 Handheld mainly for storing and carrying around music (with the convenience of an organizer) for my rehearsals. The card works flawlessly and the write and read speed is absolutely amazing. PalmOne's documentation gives the impression that only PalmOne's cards will work on their PDAs and does not document that any other SD or MMC card would work. But I took a chance with this 1GB card and I saved big time as PalmOne's 512 MB card with way lower write speeds (not even specified by their specs) sells for $99. I got this card for $89.
2,Outdated,I bought this book because my 3 year old son was getting his 3rd set of tubes and adnoids out. The other books I bought were much better. The pictures are outdated and boring. Tubes in My Ears: My Trip to the Hospital was a much better book.
3,Too Young,"My 3 yr old granddaughter actually enjoys this book. I am unsure whether or not she is actually getting the message. Each time she visits, she asks for this book by name ""my"" book the ""my my my"" book. I enjoy reading it to her and she reads it to me in her own words. I believe she gets it. check with us later (like six months when she turns 4. I recommend it anyway. When she puts her panties on we always say, cover your 'private parts' and she definitely ""gets that concept."
5,Excellent Book!,I purchased this for my 5 year old son and we love it. Great explaination what is private and who to talk to. I would recommend this book to anyone with kids. I also think they should have this in schools as well.
3,"A bit of a scarey lesson, but very important","Being a victim of sexual molestation I completely understand the importance of teaching your children good touch and bad touch, but I was afraid of making my daughter ""think"" too much about this stuff. I'm not sure of the right answer, but this may have been a bit too much for a 5 year old. Best defense......keep your children close."
2,Too Graphic,"We bought this book to begin the ""private parts"" talks with our 5 year old and 3 year old. We did not end up using it, though, because the illustrations as well as the text are too graphic. May be appropriate for a child who has been abused, but not good for kids that have not."
3,Overpriced,"The book was simple to follow, easy for the younger kids. But, it was a simple little, practically should be free, book. It was more like the type that should be given out at pre-school. The concept is great but they prey on our fears."
4,Very beautiful but...,"This is a very beautiful toe ring. I did call the company and ask if the diamond was raised higher then the band or if it was flush. She said flush. I ordered two, one for the same toe on each foot. You can't wear high healed closed toed shoes with this toe ring because the diamond is higher then the band and your shoes will press down on it vary hard. I would have to turn mine side ways, not very comfortable. In the summer with sandals this toe ring is beautiful. People really notice. I have now gone back to the toe ring that has diamonds on both sides of the band and is adjustable. It looks kind of like this one but of course without the stone. If you live in Hawaii, Florida and wear sandals everyday or tennis shoes by all means this would be a great toe ring."
1,Horrible representation of black greek life,"Being a member of a Black Greek organization and I participant in step shows during my college days, I watched this movie thinking it would remind me of a great time during my college years and that it would be along the lines of Stomp the Yard. The only good thing about this movie was the fun I had in laughing at how ridiculous the acting and the step routines were, as well as the unrealistic plot. Save your money, absolutely not worth the price. This was one of the few movies where I have been amazed at just how horrible it was! The only reason I would watch this movie again would be if I needed a good laugh, not at any well written comedic scripts, but at just how horribly bad this movie is."
3,Ladies do the dam thing!,It was some time ago that I watched the movie but It was decent. The ladies did their thing!
1,horrible,"Do not purchase! Not only is the acting poor but the plot and shooting is low budget. I bought this not anticipating it to be good but I didn't even finish watching the whole thing. At some point it was no longer even amusing on a low-budget, this is crap-level and just became pitiful. Also, the copy I had skiped and froze repeatedly. Someone probably threw the mess against the wall. I repeat, do not purchase. Worse then phantoms and gigli."
1,Save your money unless....,"Ladies and Gentlemen -- Unless you want a memento of Dame Joan Sutherland's last performance, I agree with another reviewer who said DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. The opera is boring and senseless, the production and direction is acceptable at best, and the singing -- well, lets just say it leaves much to be desired except for Amanda Thane. Clifford Grant was painful to listen to most of the time and while Anson Austin (tenor lead) has most the notes, he has no clue how to sing convincingly. Dame Joan was shaky and only appears in Acts 2 & 3 of this 5 act opera. Acts 4 & 5 are mislabeled as only Act 4 on the DVD insert. If you want to see La Stupenda in something worthwhile, try the Norma or Anna Bolena with the Canadian Opera Company or her Lucia from the Met. MAYBE, the only redeeming thing on this DVD is the 28 min. credit cue point at the end when she is on stage AFTER the performance is over."
4,leg problems,I bought this for my sister. She hasn't said if it has helped much or not. She has severe circulation problems.
3,Boston excitement,A good mystery but not a great one! I enjoyed it but how it ended up where it did I don't understand.
4,The Big Dig by Linda Barnes (2002),"Bored with her assignment working undercover to seek out fraud on Boston's Big Dig project, private detective Carlotta Carlyle moonlights by taking on the case of the missing Veronica James - an investigation that goes nowhere until the mysterious death of a construction worker uncovers links to a vast conspiracy that could threaten her own life..."
3,"Barnes' Yarn (not bad, and with kudos to Bernadette Quigley)","Not the greatest detective yarn, but with enough chops and spice to make it worth the ride in the end. Found the tape version and found the narrator compelling. Reminded me a bit of the old radio shows my grandmother loved, but with less melodrama. Have no idea what narrator looks like, but if there's a movie version, I'd go with her."
2,not a page turner,"This was my first Carlotta Carlyle book, and I thought it was boring. I will not read another one. I love murder/mystery books and this was not a page turner. The ending was very disappointing."
1,I guess anyone can get published,This reads like a junior highschool English project. Have you ever met someone at a social function and they take a long time to tell you some story that has no end and no purpose? No? Read this and you'll understand what I mean.
2,Not as described?,Anyone else notice that it only displays military time? The picture clearly shows PM next to the 12:34 but there's no such option on the clock settings menu. As I write this it's 1800 hours.For all this thing can do it seems that such a simple function would be available. I only paid [...] bucks for this and I still feel ripped off.
2,But see it for Sondheim!,"There are so many better things to do with your time than watch this movie. But how often do you get the opportunity to see Stephen Sondheim act? Rarely, so it's worth it just for that."
5,Ideal for hardcore trivia contests and enthusiasts.,"Written by Wisconsin Almanac author and sports buff Jerry Minnich, Badger Sports: Trivia Teasers presents more than six hundred trivia questions about the athletics tradition at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Covering hockey, football, men's and women's basketball, and almost every sport from rowing to wrestling, Badger Sports offers its golden nuggets in straight question-and-answer format. Black-and-white photographs illustrate this great collection of the highs, lows, scores, and star players of UW-Madison sports, ideal for hardcore trivia contests and enthusiasts."
3,WEST POINT STORY IS FUN!,"THIS MOVIE IS ON BLACK AND WHITE AND IT REALLY SHOWCASES JAMES CAGNEY, HE DOES SOME HOOFING AND IS VERY GOOD AT IT. THE MOVIE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A PLOT BUT GORDON MACRAE LOOKS SO HANDSOME IN THAT CADET UNIFORM! THIS IS A FAMILY MOVIE AND ONE MOVIE I DIDN'T LIKE DORIS DAY IN. I GAVE IT 3 STARS. ENJOYABLE!"
3,Confusion,"This is confusing. The claim is that this is an MGM musical entitled ""The West Point Story"". It is not. It is a documentary of the same name as indicated by part of the reviews. I didn't pay close attention; ordered what I thought was the musical and got the documentary just as happened to another reviewer."
1,WEST POINT STORY:FORTRESS OF FREEDOM,"I DO NOT OWN THIS MOVIE NOR DO I WANT TO,IT WAS SENT TO ME IN ERROR,I ORDERED THE MOTION PICTURE: WEST POINT STORY STARRING DORIS DAY"
3,Not so boosting,"it's not bad, but doesn't do any good for my hair either.I bought it because of ""boosting"" word - but all i got was just a conditioner"
3,Rutger at his most beautiful.,"I found the plot inane and if you don't care for rather explicit sex, it's somewhat tedious. Rutger as a young man was gorgeous but the plot is very much of a kind with some of the Beatles movies of really being too ""hip"" for words. It pretty much is about sex, sex and more sex with ridiculous older people and completely improbable situations.This movies was a terrific hit in The Netherlands when it came out, but frankly all it has is sex and pathetic characters."
3,This is a delightful film that started out as an adult movie...,"The story is so good and the acting so superior that the second half becomes much more than just an exploitation film...It begins with Eric, a sculptor and chronic woman-chaser, whose wife is dying of a brain tumor...Eric is so successful with the ladies that he begins collecting their hair, attaching it into his scrapbook... He comes across a striking redhead named Olga, whom he brutally seduces in the car... Instead of cutting her hair, he falls in love with her and chases her all over Holland...The treatment of sex is stimulating and humorous... It is not graphic, but the performers are quite active and the erotic encounters are exceptionally realistic...It moves quickly from reality to sexual fantasies combined with daydreams of killing, blood, and vengeance... Despite these outrageous displays, the movie is so full of life and powerful acting that it is more fascinating than repelling..."
4,Unexpectedly good,"I bought this film mostly because of its scandalous reputation, so that I could form my personal opinion. But what started like a crude and laughable grotesque suddenly turned into a serious and emotional drama. I believe it's done not without Ingmar Berman's influence, as it deals with Bergman's favorite themes - love, sex and death, but for the former it's more graphic that the master would ever go for. However, in our times these scenes don't show as shocking at all, although one can only imagine what an upheaval they must have caused back in seventies. I would recommend this film to serious viewers only, it's definitely not about light entertainment but rather about profound issues of artistic expression, love and death. I also think that in its graphical approach it is very North European, and comes in a sharp contrast with Italian cinema, for example."
3,there bright,they are really bright but they not very green but over all still a good product i just would like them to be a bit more green
1,Whine me a river,"This cd was one continuous song...the same song...forever...and ever. I thought this girl would be right up my ally, with her edgy rockabilly look. I was mistaken. It's very whiney. It drove me nuts. I'm surprised I made it through the whole cd. It's in the trash now. It's not even worth re-selling. I would feel bad for providing this cd for someone else. I'm not normally this negative, but I can't give this cd a bad enough review. It was truly awful."
5,Amazing and Inspiring,"This book is amazing and inspiring. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ought to, in my opinion, do everything within its power to obtain the rights to this entire book of scripture and canonize it at once. The expanded and restored passages are of amazing inspiration. Truly the Lord raised up a prophet, seer and revelator, Joseph Smith. This book will bring inspiration to me for the rest of my life."
1,Joseph Smith has done it again!,"That's right, not only did he create a fictious story called the Book of Mormon, but he had to rewrite the bible to go along with his outrageous lies! It's amazing to think people actually believe this hocus pocus. BTW--- I wonder if Joseph received revelation for his ""inspired version"" of the bible through the same magic rock he dug up in the Whitmer's well? By the time he finished writing the BOM, I'm sure he was a pro at deception and plagerism; no need for the magic stones, huh?"
1,It takes a good deal of gall...,"It takes a lot of gall to rewrite the Old testament and then claim that your version is inspired rather than the one used by churces. Smith edits, rewrites, invents for this absurdity. A mess!"
4,forest dwelling killer,"This is a powerful, surreal and frightening film. Like Deliverance, It's mostly about the very thin veneer of civilization. Shot in a cinema verite style, the brutality and horror seems almost documentary like, unlike Deliverance where there are practically signposts saying ""meaning here"", this film allows the horror and absurdity of itself unfold itself slyly around the edge of the frame. (consider the brilliant satire of having the surgeons chant ""take him apart! take him apart!"" as they dance around the campfire. And the eerie shot of the forest dwelling killer standing on top of the hill, a shadow against the sun.)Wheras Deliverance was all about northern white guilt, the doctors in this film have something to be guilty about. I think ""Rituals"" is great but the film reveals it's limitations, it's lack of guts, and it's prettifying of nature. Ultimately ""Deliverance"" is a superior film."
5,Astrology and Free Will,"This book blends many different philosophies and gives the message that using astrology can be a tool to self-understanding and transformation. I see now, that it is not a mysterious tool of divination but that it can be used to examine our existing beliefs, and that it is up to us what we do with that knowledge."
3,An ok overview of toys history,"When I bought this dvd I was expecting a history of toys a little deeper than this one (including maybe more historical names, inventors, more situations that forced the constitution of some toys perhaps, also a bit more of the history of toys in the world, not just in the US).Nevertheless it is very well made and has a good time line, it covers most of the basics of this history so if you are looking for an overview, history of main toys in the US, it will be just fine."
5,Excellent course of instruction,The Palmer-Hughes course books are a well thought-out set of instructional materials. The user can never be dissatisfied with this plan for learning the accordion
4,Christmas book by Palmer,"Nice book that will provide the music for any level accordion player. Each song is written for simple, complex and multi-accordion. You'll love it."
1,Low quality,"These glasses are made out of cheap plastic and did not fit my face.Essentially a piece of junk,at a ridiculace price."
3,Quicksand II,"It's amazing how much this band sounds like Quicksand. It's a decent EP; production is good, vocals are a little shaky in parts, but not bad overall. The last song drags on, clocking in at over 7 minutes. If you are a Quicksand fan, you'll either appreciate it because it sounds like them, or write it off as a ripoff. You could easily fool your friends into thinking this is a new Quicksand record. Did I mention it sounds like Quicksand? :)"
4,Great start for the band,"I heard ""Remnants"" in late 2002, and waited until March of 2003 to finally get this EP. It may not be the best thing you'll ever hear, but it shows much promise in this Texas band. The cd is not badly produced, and has some great riffs in the songs. The best songs on the Cd would be ""Remnants"" and ""Pass On Through"", in my opinion. For 7$, it's worth it."
2,Echoes of the Dance,"I really enjoy Marcia Willett's books as they are full of characters that feel like friends. This one was not one of my favorites, but was still a worthwhile read."
5,As Good As the Series.,"After saving the world from Nagi's insane destruction plot, the Windbloom kingdom and Garderobe Academy are back to normal. A disaster strikes, and Mai & Mashiro are transported to an island with no way off. The rest of the Otome are trying to find them. Arika cannot use her powers since Mashiro is gone. There is also a terrorist group that is trying to free Nagi and resurrect an ancient Otome. There is plenty of action and drama to see in this OVA. The good thing about this is that since it's a short OVA, the production quality is much higher than the series. But My Otome is still not as good as My Hime."
1,Stay away from this one!!!!,"I bought this printer some months ago, and I only used a few times for printing, since I actually bought it for scanning. But after weeks I realized that every time I turned on the printer, even for scanning, the level of ink was decreasing. So this printer not only takes about a minute to get ready after you turn it on (wasting ink unnecessarily), but actually at the end it will tell you that the cartridges are empty when indeed you can hear that there is some ink in them. Once it tells you that one of the cartridges is empty...it won't print at all!!."
2,Utter Junk,"This is the only all in one printer I have ever owned and I bought it in 2004. The scanner part of the unit is good and works well for negatives and slides. The printer's color matching ability is good. The scanner refuses to work on any level if the ink is out and this is why I gave it a low review. Also, the ink cartridges don't last long and will ask to be replaced when there is enough ink for 3 or 4 more documents. Also, you don't have the option to print just black and white, they say this is because it keeps the color ink fresh. Also, the card reader doesn't read sdmc cards over 1mb. Overall, I am unsatisfied with this printer and wish I would have bought something better for this kind of money."
3,"Nice, creamy consistency...color? what color?","I have light olive skin, and this was recommended by InStyle magazine for my skin type/tone. I definitely like the formula, but I'm not quite sure about the color. It's like wearing nothing at all. It also didn't last past 2 hours, and I had nothing to drink or eat. I just wasn't blown away, and felt I could have spent far less at the drug store for the same results."
2,bad packaging,"I liked this lips stain but the bottle does not close tightly. While closing the first bottle. I broke the lid. I took it back and it was replaced but I was warned that it was a delicate lid. When I was careful not to close the second bottle too tight, it opened up IN MY PURSE!. I think I should get a refund. But I'm done with this stain. Bobbie Brown has a creamy stain that doesn't drip and lasts just as long and stays moist."
2,too orangey for me,"i wanted a true NUDE color. after hearing what a perfect nude this was, and because i love nars, i tried it.i do not like the color at all.I'm fair skinned with brown eyes and dark skin, and this is very orangey. when i wanted my lips to be very neutral and nude, they stand out like a sore thumb against the rest of my makeup.unfortunately, my hubby threw away the packaging, so i can't return it...."
4,"Not bad, as far as short self-helpers go.","Not bad, as far as short self-helpers go. Some were things that made me go ""Yea, this doesn't apply to me."" Some made me think ""I knew this, I really should start doing it."" And for some, I took notes. I like the research references at the end of each Point."
4,Good use,This was a put to good use for my daughters birthday cake. Some of the paint looked kinda funny but not noticeable if you don't look to closely.
3,Haven't used it much,I'd like to become more familiar with the old Negro Spirituals. Someday I'll take the time to learn them better.
5,Great Book,"This is not only a song book, it's also gives some history of the music too. I wanted a selection of black spirituals and this is what I was looking for and more! This is great for learning to sing, and they're good songs to commit to memory. I wish there were more songs, somehow 230 doesn't seem like enough!"
2,Correction for the previous reviewer!,"This book originally was written in 1937-38, and published in 1938. The first ""Little House"" book came out in 1932, and the books in Laura Ingalls Wilder's series dealing with her South Dakota years, beginning with ""By the Shores of Silver Lake"" were first published in 1937. So it is more likely that Rose, while editing her mother's books for publication, used (I hate to use the term ""plagarized"" but it almost fits) her mother's children's books as ideas for her own (she also did this with ""Let the Hurricane Roar""). Both ""Free Land"" and ""Hurricane"" (reissued in the 70's as ""Young Pioneers"") are probably only of interest to those interested in Rose Wilder Lane, whom I believe was better at editing other people's material and writing short stories than actually writing entire books on her own."
1,way too large,i ordered this necklace thinking that it would be small and dainty. it is actually quite large and cheap looking. i was really disappointed
5,frying pan for fish,"I had an old pan for over 30 years and it broke, so it took me several weeks to find one like I had and this one was perfect the only issue I had was that it took me a lot longer to season that the instructions indicated"
5,"20"" cast iron skillet","This 20"" cast iron skillet is huge. It is large enough to cook 6 pounds of shrimp at once. If the need to cook really large amounts of food is your task, then this is the item for you. It is heavy and it will need to be seasoned before first use."
1,Ridiculously large,"I was so excited, until I saw the box. Then I knew I was in trouble.Its about the size of a bottle cap for a 3000 gallon coke bottle.It's large - ridiculously, unusably largeIt's so large, it won't fit on my range top - I would need 6 burners with no controls.It's not seasoned but I was ok with that until I realized I can't season it because it won't fit in my stove, which is too shallow.Too big to fit on my large Big Green Egg.I have a normal sized kitchen, normal sized appliancesPotential alternative uses include a small neighborhood pool or in winter a semi-portable ice skating rink."
1,Bill R,"The first time we used it the pan developed a huge crack. It is now unuseable. We did follow the directions to ""season"" the pan by pre-heating and putting oil on it."
4,French film scores!,"Even though apparently aged, black and white, and treatment, this film packs a wallop. Timeless themes and beautifully filmed. Definitely not your Hollywood movie, and not a cheerful one either."
3,A look at a suicidal person,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Fire Within, or ""Le Feu Follet"" in French is Lois Malle's fifth feature film.The film is about Alain Leroy who is in a private clinic battling alcoholism. One day he checks out in a suididal state and debates about whether or not to kill himself while visiting old friends.The special features include interviews with director Louis Malle and actor Maurice Ronet, new interviews with actress Alexandra Stewart and filmmakers Philippe Collin and Volker Schlöndorff, and the 2005 short documentary ""Jusqu'au 23 Juillet"" which is about the film the novel it is based on.This is hard film to watch due to it's theme of self-destructive behavior."
2,poor quality,my daughter had fun making it and the instructions are easy to use but the stone cracked within a few days of making it; very disappointing.
2,Where's the orchestra?,"Listening to this over high fidelity stereo loudspeakers, I found this video largely unsatisfying. It's pleasant to look at, and the singing is fine. The main problem is the balance. The orchestra is much too far in the background, as if the engineers mistakenly considered it to be accompaniment to the singing. As a result the spectacularly colored orchestrations, the harmony, and much of the DRAMA (!) of this work are lost in this video. In short, musically it makes no sense...except for a number of scattered moments when the beautiful sound of the music is discernible. I suspect that this was a good performance, badly recorded or engineered."
3,"musically interesting, but very cold staging","The cold and abstract staging here is clearly meant to reflect the suffocating world of the title character, but two hours of it becomes very disagreable. Better get the CD version: the music is gorgeous and there is no distraction from the intensity of the music."
4,Fun Game if a little bland toward the end,"This game is worth it to play. It's fun, interesting, and the TRON world is just cool. However, towards the end, the game gets a little bland and generic.With that being said, it's a VERY fun game."
4,Missing one track!,"The only thing I can really find wrong with this album is the lack of the song 'Leap Of Faith' which, in my opinion, is their best song! The CD is very good in general though, containing some of The Suicide Machines' best (Killing Blow, Perfect Day, Vans Song). Very good 'first Suicide Machines' CD."
3,an ok cd,This CD was OK. If you are just getting into the Suicide machines I recommend Destruction by Definition before getting this one.
1,crapy cheap,I would just like to say that there is no way anyone should buY these cheap guitars..im not kidding..they dont tune right ..there cheap and dont play or sound liKE a guitar...i waited a week and i got it the smorniNG and i was beyond dissapointed...im a begginer and i would never play this..i am returning right now.horrid horrid qualit flimsy cheap...i am appaled at how horrid this is.its liek a guitar u would find in aplay set for a 2 year old...tiny lightweight and very low quality..i cant even stress how horrid it is..i have nothing good to say..even the cutaway isnt even cutaway anough to access any high notes wich makes the hole cutaway pointless.not even worth 10 dollers let alone 40 or the original price.wich i dont believe it was ever priced at that its just to get u to think ur getting a deal...
1,Bad Guitar at cheap price,"Wood not high quality,wreaked of spray paint,cheapest guitar ever constructed,will not tune,2 sets of bad strings,had chips in the paint,also had a crack near the top of the fret board,the top two strings buzz no matter what,and the bridge slides and isn't fixed into place,nor have notches for the strings not to slide out of place. All in all a worthless product even for a beginner. I bought a Dean for [...] bucks more that I've had for years and is one of the best mini guitars I've ever heard."
2,needs improvement,"I found this item to look the part very well.As a musician i can recognize the effort it took to make this guitar look great.As for quality of sound .I found it to be very poor but what do you expect for the price.However it should at least be tunable and have a fair sound to it.For a small child you would like to be able to have a instrument you can teach,play and tune,Im from TN and here we know what a guitar ahould sound like.My rating is two stars for this product."
3,The rumors end here,"Shirley Eaton was the woman sprayed with gold paint in the James Bond movie ""Goldfinger."" It was uncomfortable, but she survived it and it had no physical effects on her. That should end the rumors about her. The book continues to tell of the rest of her life in film and in reality. She also has a book on poetry."
4,Succinct and essential,Covers the very elemental basics. Good for a challenging class. Don't expect detailed treatment. Section on Partnership taxation is only 58 pages long. There are sections of the IRC Regulations longer than that. Still a good value.
3,Gilbert law Summaries Taxation of Business Entities,It is a good book but more for a lawyer than for a tax preparer.
4,See Hoffman Do Russian Pathos,"This is one of those movies you have to search for, even for the few who know it exists. Its got all the Russian depth and despair. Not an easy watch. Was the virginal Hoffman up to the role? You decide."
5,"Fascinating, complex character study","Very interesting, well acted videotaped play, starring Dustin Hoffman in oneof his earliest leading roles.Hoffman has some great moments, though he occasionally goes over the top,but the whole cast of NY theater actors is top notch.Hoffman plays a reader for a publishing company in 1890s Russia with grandiosedreams who is assigned to read the diary of a now dead nobleman, and their twovery different tragic lives blend in Hoffman's character's head.Deft and well handled and ultimately quite moving. A very interesting use of multipletime frames and fantasies.The quality of the videotape itself is a bit rough - understandablegiven the age - but this is well worth seeing."
1,"yaaaaawn, zzzzzzzzZngooorrrkkkk!","Boring. I would recommend the CBS archived Nursing Diaries - much more virtual and much like shadowing nurses in the real setting. Very helpful when I presented to my nursing students. This one, forget about it."
3,an unique and excellent book,"It is an unique and excellent book. It explains in details the pointer concept. However, I think some of the codes can be better written. The examples in the book are written in such a way sometimes it is difficult to get get the points cross to its readers. For example, the examples can use more printf statement to let readers see the result."
5,Huge assembling of unrealased Burroughs essays and short sroties,This book is an assembling of previously unreleased short stories and essay from Burroughs between the time where he wrote Queer and Naked Lunch. The book countains The Junky Christmas and other stories ending on Word a text where the writer transforms in the radical seer of Naked Lunch. The book countains elements of writing that bad been assembled in Naked Lunch in the cut-up method. This book is enjoyable by the fact that it countains thirteen differents stories and that those essay had been unpublished with wonderful introduction by Oliver Harris giving the exact sense of the feeling of those writtings. Burroughs is always unpredictable going from stories of Tnager to crude hardcore violence and crude metaphors that complete the huge writing og one of the most important American writer of the 60's.
4,A great example of American story telling.,"Burroughs takes the essence of Naked Lunch, and this time divivdes it into somewhat a short-story form. The way Burroughs mashes a million different idea into one sentence really makes you feel like you are in the mind of a junkie."
2,Missed it,I must not be cool or smart (or high) enough. I tried hard to like this book but just couldn't follow it. I get that he is deconstructing language and all that but... Meh.
3,History,"A very well written book on a man named John Miller. The author puts out a very good case for his being Billy The Kid. Although Miller never himself claimed to be The Kid, lots of his friends and family believed him to be. Very well researched book with loads of interviews from Millers friends. The story has never been proven to be false. This could very well be the Kid himself."
5,Around the world in 45 minutes,Let Ricardo take you on a musical ride around the world with this album - all the way from Congo to Cuba with a little stop in Turkey. How can you resist this journey?
4,Wamsutta towels,"They are fine, but not as good of a quality as the centennial towel from years past (a few spare threads sticking up here and there), but still over-all better than many other towels we have tried.Update: We have now had these towels for over a year and a half. They are not as fluffy as they were, but soak up just as much, and have held up very well, with daily use. None of them have shredded at the edges.... A good quality towel (same goes for the wash cloths)."
1,"Pseudo scholarship, tabloid reporting, erroneous conclusions","While some of his comparisons seem accurate, this 'thesis' written by a 19 year old surfer, falls no where near the actual truth about this religious organization. Large assumptions coupled with negative innuendo are used in a fairly convincing attempt to create a false expose'.Unless you are a believer of the National Inquirer, a closed minded fundamentalist in your own religious belief, or relish seeking out the negative nature of all mankind, go somewhere else to find out about the teachings of Eckankar."
1,Disappointing polemics mar the value of this book.,"I have of course read David Christopher Lane's book on Eckankar, but find it disappointing because although it may be true as far as it goes it seems so polemical, so lacking in a kind of religious empathy or sense of balance and complexity, as though he were just out to find only the negative aspects of Twitchell or the movement."
3,Kindle edition,"I thought I was getting the whole book with the kindle edition but it didn't download the whole thing. I like to have the actual book, but I'm not going to pay over two-hundred bucks for it LoL."
3,good sound but little amplification,These speakers would be better as headphones than speakers-the sound is excellent but power is lacking.
5,Good Speakers,These are good Speakers and get pretty louad. I recommend buying a universal adapter for it to have it pluged into wall. If you want a powerful speaker this is the one for you.
5,Daylight anytime you need it.,"This light turns night in to day with the 2 500 watt bulbs. It has a sturdy stand, and it is nice how the height is adjustable. It would be nice to have two, because this thing will create a shadow, and two at 90 degrees would help reduce the dark spots."
2,Real disappointment,"The ""Gold Fibre"" name and increased cost over Mead Cambridge top-bound notebooks left me with high expectations for this book. Used equally over 4 months with two Mead offerings this notebook's front cover and a number of pages disattached completely with the back piece of cardboard on its way while the Mead notebooks were in fine condition. Also, notes taken with a Bic mechanical pencil would be smudged and faded on this book's pages while remaining clear and dark on my other notebooks.I will not be returning to Ampad notebooks and I believe my foray into top-bound books is also over as their ease of writing is outweighed by the difficulty of flipping through and searching your notes."
2,"Snow White DVD-Unless you like KK, skip this film.","The only reason I saw this movie was for Kristin Kreuk. Granted, she filmed it two years ago when she was seventeen, but she was terrible. So was the rest of the movie. Cinematically, it wasn't even that beautiful. I would say the only good thing about the film was Kristin, and she didn't have any lines practically. Miranda Richardson was tirelessly annoying, as was the rest of the cast. The script is a wreck. The worst part about the film is that it had the potential to be great. A dark version of the classic fairy tale. Bring it on! It wasn't that dark, nor was it even vaguely interesting. However, I'll be buying it anyway, such is the beauty of Kristin Kreuk. Her acting in the film isn't great, but her charisma is captivating."
3,"Snow White Good. This movie, eh.","Got this movie for my nephew.Pros:Good cast, good graphics, and good music.Cons:A bit dull, as I find most Hallmark movies, because plots are a little thin and long winded.Summary:All in all, not a bad movie but, not a particulary good one either."
1,Really isn't that great.,"I didn't like this one. There was a jagged feel to the way the scenes lurches around and the acting--especially the dwarves--was bad enough that I couldn't immerse myself in the story.However, the imagery was breathtaking. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save the film."
1,".....""who is the C R A P P I E S T one of all??""","This pedestrian attempt at storytelling has to be the most pathetically ridiculous interpretation of Snow White that I have ever seen. I should have known better than to spend ($$$) this film, considering that it was made by the same nincompoops who butchered Alice in Wonderland in 1999. I could write pages and pages about this film. ...PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS VERY LAME FILM. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LIVE-ACTION VERSION OF SNOW WHITE, SCOUT AROUND FOR A USED COPY OF THE OUT OF PRINT 'CANNON MOVIE TALE' VERSION!!!"
5,"Mirror, Mirror...","I bought this as a gift for my 10 year old sister but we both really love watching this film. So clever, so different, so unique. It's dark, dangerous, adventurous and haunting but it's also very colourful and will leave the viewer more than satisfied with their experience. It is everything a true fairytale should be. In my experience, Hallmark films such as this are better than major blockbuster films aiming for the same thing. I am glad we discovered this film. Actually, we might even watch it again tonight.Great for kids, familys and heck even adults such as myself. 10/10."
1,Stupid and Scary!,"Me, being 12 now still remember this movie from when I was 6, and it still to this day gives me nightmares, and I don't get scared easily.It was a horrible film, and totally re-written, it's not at all like Disney's Snow White."
1,Spectacularly Bad,"This version hyped itself up to be a dark, seedy version of Snow White. So, I was stoked. Snow White is almost an obsession for me. It's always been my favorite tale. Imagine my dissapointment when I watch this C-Grade version. It's so kiddiefied it's unbearable. Where's the dark? Where's the scary? Nowhere to be found unfortunately. The character of Snow White is so dullingly two-dimensional and good for goodness sake that you just want to smack her. Miranda Richardson tries, but can't get past the shoddy script. The chick from Smallville may be pretty but that's it. The only highlight is Warwick Davis (From Willow) who continues to be one of my favorite actors. If you want to see a REAL dark and scary version of Snow White (that's DEFINATELY not for kids) go and rent Snow White: A Tale of Terror. That'll scare the wits out of you."
4,"Lots of history, but not a how-to","This book focuses on the stories of the people who live aboard floating houses (very few boats) on Lake Union in Seattle. Lots about their history, a little about what it's like to live aboard a boat, but not very useful to someone (like myself) interesting in what it's like to live aboard a boat (a houseboat is more like a little house, complete with rooms and insulation and plumbing and suchlike).For what it is, it's enjoyable (although more pictures to illustrate the stories would have been nice)."
4,Gin blossoms,"ah Gin Blossoms, how I missed them. Makes me feel like it was 1995 all over again. Such a simpler time."
3,"It's a good ""Experience"".","Truth be known, this band used to annoy me. But once I actually got this album and listened to it, I grew to like it quite a bit. It's hard not to. It's mostly upbeat catchy alt-pop, the kind you'd expect to hear in the early 90's. They do have a ""Best Of"" also, but most of those great songs are already on here. Included is ""Alison Road"", ""Until I Fall Away"", ""Found Out About You"", and the popular ""Hey Jealousy"". Any radio listener should know these songs, and the others are nearly as good. I recommend picking this disc up. There should be about 5 copies at your local used store. There's also a ""Deluxe"" version of this out."
5,One of my top 5 favorite albums of all time,"Plain and simple... INCREDIBLE!!! Every song is great. Though most of the radio hits are penned by the late Doug Hopkins, there are great songs written by Robin Wilson & Jesse Valenzuela. Jesse (the original vocalist before they got signed) shows off his vocals on ""Cheatin'"". All in all, this is one of the best CDs I have ever heard. It never gets old!"
3,Catchy And Yet Samey,"This isn't an album I can usually listen to all the way through. Oh, it's fine enough, and none of the songs out-and-out stink, but far too many sound alike. ""Found Out About You"" (excellent production work and more heartfelt vocals) remains my favorite, and ""Cheatin'"" adds a good dose of diversity, but that song's buried at the end of the disc. The rest of the songs run towards the competent but interchangable - ""Alison Road"" could be ""Until I Fall Away"", and so on. Not bad, but not memorable. If you like a song or two off this, odds are good that you can borrow it from your next-door neighbor."
3,A little *too* catchy,"I think the general likeableness that the first reviewer expressed is what bugs me about this disc. I thought it was great the first several times I listened (except for the countrified last track- I'm NOT a country music fan), but even the best tracks have gotten boring on multiple listens. The tracks all seem to sound the same..."
4,New Wonderful Experience,"If like me you missed the apparently brief 2002 appearance of the NME Deluxe Edition and have balked at paying the outlandish prices of those offering copies of the Deluxe Edition for sale, relief is at hand. And what a relief it is! There is just about everything to enjoy about this NME Rarities Edition if you are a fan of the Gin Blossoms. The contents are well-described above and and well worth owning and hearing.RIP Doug Hopkins, long live the Gin Blossoms!"
5,A Definate Favorite!,"This album is packed with some of my favorite songs. I got this as a gift for my buddy who took me to Vegas and Gin Blossoms were playing just for the company my buddy works with. You could go right up to the stage, no security like at a concert venue. Got to high five the band and took pics up close and personal. It was awesome. I've got most songs on my MP3 and listen to it in the gym. Makes for a great workout."
4,One of the 90's best,An album that came from a very special time of music during the early 90's. Not a single bad song on this album that never requires skipping. An album you can play for almost any occasion and that never grows old. Nothing fancy but a very solid rock album with very catchy songs that I believe even the radio still plays to this day. Highly recommended
4,gin blossoms sounds are cool,gin blossoms sounds are simple but the melodies are catchy with beautiful lyrics
1,Bad Business,"I ordered the Deluxe Edition of the Gin Blossom's New Miserable Experience from this vendor.I received the standard version, wrote to complain, and haven't heard back for three days.I have never met a more irresponsible vendor online. Ever.Amazon should yank their vendor license before they continue doing bad business.Spend your money elsewhere or get burned."
5,A CLASSIC Package!,"DISC 2 shows that the GIN BLOSSOMS have much to offer and the band was not just about the songs of DOUG HOPKINS. Their cover of SOUL DEEP is a WINNER! Robin's singing performance is AMAZING and the playing of JESSE, SCOTTY, BILL and PHILLIP can not be understated. This is a band that still has alot of music left in them and in fact are back in the studio right now JULY, 2004. Just saw them LIVE a few weekends ago and they are still as GREAT as ever! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this package!"
4,"Tell me these songs don't ""sound' (nevermind the lyrics) like some guy singing about being cuckolded in an undergrad way -lol","I bought both of the albums when the band was getting heavy radio play. I can't get over how even though I couldn't always decipher the mumbling - it sounded like the guy was singing about being cheated on in a flannel shirt, broken down Converse sneakers kind of way. Some songs just sound like they are being sung by a cuckold like that line in Office Space about how everyone thinks your girlfriend's cheating on you. How Onion!"
2,"One Good Song, The Rest Is Repetative","The Gin Blossoms' debut album is weak. All tracks sound very similar to each other and seems to go nowhere in creativity. ""Hey Jealousy"" is by far the best track on the album and should be worth a good listen. ""Cajun Song"" is meaningless and does not even sound like anything close to something with a Cajun flavor, and ""Cheatin"" is a sad rip-off of any country tear-jerking-cry-in-your-beer garbage that no one likes anymore. Fair."
3,A Bit Disappointing..,"A collection like this is a bit disappointing to fans that 1) purchased the Deluxe edition 2) have been fans for awhile. I think that because this rarities disc has appeal that is limited to Gins fans, most would be better off purchasing the New Miserable Experience Deluxe Edition. That product has the remastered New Miserable Experience, the nice packaging, as well as the tunes from this disc. This seems to be just another random excuse to re-release what people already have in the pursuit of making a bit more money off this old gem. (And calling this a essential collectors track album is humorous, when clearly NME Deluxe has more appeal in that regard.)"
4,What a Shame!,"I must start by saying that the Gin Blossoms rank in my top 5 bands of all time! Robin Wilson has a voice made for pop music! But who from the record companies are writing these reviews! Do I really need NME again? I already have two copies ( yeah I fell for the alt. 2nd cover trick back in my younger days ) and being a hardcore fan I already have all but maybe 2 of the songs on disc 2! So am I really expected to go out and drop a huge load of cash for 2 songs! Forget it! Just another tactic to try to milk more money out of hardcore fans! Well not me this time, I'll pray and wait for a new album now that the band is touring together again! Thanks but no thanks!"
5,Wonderful and Delightful,"I also bought this cd after hearing them on CMT and have found it to be the best cd I have bought this year and I have gotten many great ones. The music, instruments, singing and harmonies are hauntingly beautiful. I love the whole cd, but my favorite two songs are The Lighthouse's Tale and When you come back down. I can't wait to see them live."
5,Nickel Creek is a gifted group!,"My son shared this CD with me, and I immediately had to go out and buy one. I also got one for my best friend for her birthday. ""The Hands Song"" is so touching, ""Out of the Woods"" is virtually ethereal with its tight harmony, and dream-like ending, and my son's favorite, ""When You Come Back Down"" is a great tune! Listening to the instrumentals leaves me asking, ""How can their fingers move that quickly?"" I recommend this highly! You'll become addicted just like me!"
4,EXTREMELY Well Crafted - Vocals need a tad more soulfulness,"Four and a half stars. Like another reviewer, I picked this CD up after hearing it in a music store. In general, I think this is a fantastic CD showcasing remarkable talent. The composition is imaginative and the playing is very tight! The singers' voices are spirited and very clear -- almost too clear. They often (but not always) seem to lack the soulfulness that makes great vocal performances communicate regardless of words. Despite this minor lack, this album is a remarkable achievement which will probably grow on you even if it doesn't quite enthrall you at first. It is a very well crafted album which will be appreciated all the more by anyone who has ever taken up an instrument."
5,Great Sound,"I really enjoy listening to Nickel Creek. There sound is clear, refreshing, and unique. The lyrics are equally inspiring. I particularly liked the songs ""when you come back down"" and ""the hand song"". The poetry is beautiful. Each song somehow reaches deeper than mere words can, to express exactly what I'm feeling and remind me that God is there."
3,a little disappointed,"I had gotten the CD ""Why Should the Fire Die"" after hearing the song ""When in Rome"" on the radio and really enjoyed it. (I actually thought Glenn Philips had cut a new disk and called the radio station to find out who it was...) I picked this one up hoping it would be equally good. I was dissapointed. The music sounds like it is from a totally different band. Granted, this disk is growing on me - but it did not seem to be the same genre of music on the whole. There are some lovely arrangements, and the bluegrass picking is quite nice, as well as very good vocals - but not what I was expecting. If you dig Allison Krauss, or the Old in the Way type thing - you'll enjoy this. However - it is fairly mellow."
5,Great From Start To Finish!,"After seeing a few Nickel Creek Videos on CMT I was instantly hooked on their sound. This CD is refreshing to hear in this day and age of ""Pop/Country"". The band sticks to traditional Bluegrass and sometimes Celtic ideas. The musicianship is remarkable and the sound of the recording is top-notch. A great mix of up-tempo songs and hauntingly lovely ballads make this CD a welcome edition to any collection. Do your stereo a favor and play this CD often! P.S. The group's fiddler Sara Watkins is beautiful!"
4,Outstanding young blugrass,Solid musicians and great harmony. I'm looking forward to more from Nickle Creek!
5,Worth Every Nickel,"This group has a bright, fresh sound with qualities one would expect to hear from more seasoned performers with more years of experience. A definite ""must have"" for anyone who enjoys bluegrass sound with just a bit of a twist. Spending time looking for other albums by this great trio. Keep 'em coming!"
4,MP3 Encourages Musical Purchases,"At the Winterhawk Bluegrass Festival in NY state there was a buzz in the air prior to this bands performance. I had never heard of them. I was rapt by their sound and committed their name to memory.Cruising around Napster I searched for their name, found titles up there, and immediately rushed to Amazon to buy. Ah. What a pleasure. Sarah's voice is a gem and the talent of the band a joy to listen to. Bluegrass fan or not, you will love this."
4,A great CD,"Nickel Creek is great. Allison Krauss is the producer of this CD and while she's not featured on the CD, she doesn't need to be. This young band is the future of bluegrass and they've taken it mainstream.A great CD for anyone, not just those with familiarity with country/bluegrass."
5,"""Top Shelf"" Stuff","I came accross this album by sheer chance, waiting in a book store, and it happend to be featured in one of their ""listening stations"". Right from the opening track, one is struck by the quality of their musicianship, the beautiful vocals and the way they ""handle"" the songs and music. My personal favorites on this album are ""Sweet Afton"" based on a poem penned by the great Robbie Burns, this one is a knockout! I very much enjoy ""the Lighthouse"", ""The Fox"" and ""Ode To A Butterfly"". Do yourself a favor...pick up a copy of this album, it's money well spent."
5,The Best Bluegrass CD I have ever Heard,"These guys are my absolute favorite. The CD is fabulously filled with talented artists, awesome melody, incredible music, and intriuging lyrics. Nickel Creek is what I believe to be the most talented and uplifting band I have ever heard and most likely ever will. This is my favorite CD ever, and Nickel Creeks music is the only thing I will listen to. I strongly recomend this CD, for young and old, and even for those who aren't big fans of Bluegrass or country music."
5,Why I think Nickel Creek is great,"The first time I heard the song Reasons Why it took my breath away and that is not a joke! I could hardly breathe through the whole song! Thankfully, the song ended so I could breathe! The song is excellent and so is their album. Please buy this album. It is not every day we get someone in the music business who actually know what they are doing!"
5,Amazing!,"I was recently gifted a Pro-ject Debut Carbon turntable. I've wanted a turntable for years, but couldn't pull the trigger on one due to either extremely cheap products, or extremely expensive ones. When I saw the carbon come out, I felt as though I should just go for it. After listening to several albums, I knew I made the right choice. It sounds amazing! Much better than CD's or even my high resolution audio files. It has exceeded all of my expectations. Anyway, more to the point, even though all of the records I played on it sounded absolutely fantastic, this Nickel Creek album outshines everything else I have in my collection. You can close your eyes and picture the band playing right in front of you. Every little detail is there. It's so beautifully done. Whoever recorded and mastered this album knew what they were doing. I can't stop listening!"
5,some of the best music i've ever heard,Nickel Creek plays instruments as if God himself was palying them and then you hear their voices its amazing they are perfect I love each and everyone of their songs you can listen to this cd no matter what mood your in they are great
4,Amazing,What a sincere album for such a young group. I'm sure the hand of Allison Krauss had a great deal to do with that. There are many opportunities for tugging the heart strings as well as kickin' up the heals.
2,Nickel Creek,"This disc is OK. It sounds too much like Alison Krauss for my taste. Her music is too austere - not enough picking. They seem to be pretty good, the music doesn't appeal to me. When it comes to Bluegrass, I like Del McCoury, Ricky Skaggs, and Blue Highway."
2,Disappointing,"It's definitely not bluegrass, if that's what you're looking for save your money. It's more enfluenced by Celtic and jazz, I think. Some of the songs I really like, but top to bottom I don't think it's that good. I just saw them live at Wintergrass in Tacoma. They are talented musicians and have great voices, but the style they play just doesn't appeal to me very much."
1,Bland music to doze by . . .,"This music is really, really, really boring. Really. I bought it after reading several other glowing reviews; what a mistake. Thin voices, bland songs which all sound about alike, very little interesting going on, despite their obvious abilities on their instruments. These folks might be better placed as backup studio musicians behind more exciting artists."
1,Disappointing,"I heard one of their up-tempo blue grass instrumentals on the radio and thought they'd be great. There's all too little of their better stuff here and a lot of sugary, sappy vocals. Boring!"
1,disappointed,"I bought this disc on amazon.com due to the recommondation of the site. I was very disappointed as this had nothing whatever to do with any bluegrass or instrumental guitar work that I was familiar with. This sounds like someone looking for a style somewhere between ""new country"" or what passes for country nowdays amd the junk that passes for pop."
5,Simply amazing!,"This CD is just amazing. I'd never heard of Nickel Creek until just a few weeks ago when I happened to catch their video of ""Reasons Why."" I immediately ran to my computer to order the CD. In the couple of weeks since I received it, it's all I've listed to - in the car and at work. The musicianship is superb, while the songs are beautifully written and arranged. Chris Thile is a standout - a young instrumentalist who also writes and arranges, and has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. It's worth listening to over and over and over ..."
4,Dreamy and beautiful,"I rarely buy cds, as money is tight for me...however, after catching a snippet of Nickle Creek on PBS, I tracked them down at my local bookstore and purchased the cd. I have never bought or listened to bluegrass before, as I thought it would be like country, which I really don't care for. I was pleased when I found them, and even more pleased with the gentle, beautiful songs on their cd, especially ""Out of the Woods."""
5,Magnificent,"It is not often I could not fault an album after just one listen but this album is an exception. Three highly talented musicians do what they do best. The album is wonderfully raw and unique. the voices are great, the instrumentation is magnificent and there is the right mix of vocal and instrumental. I personally would not call this bluegrass, more folk-based with bluegrass influence. Best tracks are the opening two, The Fox and When You Come Back Down.This album is just faultless. It has a unique feel, the right balance of vocal and instrumental, excellent talent, immaculate production and raw ability shown to the full."
4,out of the woods is the best song,"the best song on this cd is ""Out of the Woods."" It is very laid back and it makes me feel so good. I love the sound. It is great music for listening to on the road or just coming home after work and flipping on the stereo to relax. This group is very talented and is definitely going somewhere!!"
4,I don't know if you'd call'em country but they're good,"So much of what passes for country, or I suppose even Bluegrass,these days is nothing of the sort but these kids are different. Just about every song had something in it for the listener although some like #5 Reasons Why didn't do much for me and #7 Sweet Afton was a little slow.Chris Thiles does most of the lead vocals, he's all right although I preferred Sara Watkins on #9 The Hand Song (I wish she'd record her own album because she has a beautiful voice)Well worth owning."
3,The ups and downs of youth,"After really enjoying Why Should the Fire Die, I decided to get to know Nickel Creek from their start. This album features the ups and downs of their youth at the time - hopeful, clean energy, but at times too simplistic and lacking the confidence they later developed. I consider the instrumentals to be the main treat here."
5,Extreme Depth of Musical Ability,"This CD was my introduction to Nickel Creek. All three of these musicians are phenomenally gifted, and each shows expertise in their respective instruments. The music is well balanced, expertly written and executed perfectly. The songs are meaningful, and thoughtful.You do not necessarily have to be a fan of bluegrass to enjoy this, as it mixes traditional bluegrass with modern twists."
5,Captured me like no music has in many years ...,"Okay, I've got 20 years or so on these kids, but I can remember a time when music really meant something to me, when a song could grab my heart, seize my imagination, make me wistful, fire me up, thrill me like nothing else ... Remember that? You have to fight to keep from losing that capacity. This album is your weapon. Apart from the jaw-dropping instrumental virtuosity of these kids (before I ever heard of Nickel Creek, I had run across Chris Thile's work on a Bela Fleck CD, and Bela doesn't bring in just anybody to play on his records) and the tight vocal harmonies, Nickel Creek has put together 12 beautiful songs. They range from jazz-inspired bluegrass to bluegrass-inspired Celtic to acoustic pop that would have been huge hits if they'd been sung by CS&N or Fleetwood Mac way back before these teens were born. And I've done a poor job of categorizing their music, or more likely it defies categorization. This album is a refresher for the soul."
5,"Rising, Shining Stars","My husband joined a cd club and was forced to order a few cd's as part of the contract. He picked this one out of the blue. When I opened up the package I thought, ""Why did he order a cd with a bunch of teenagers singing?"" Then I listened and was completely blown away. These kids are among the best in their field. My favorite is ""The Lighthouse's Tale"". We've owned this cd for two weeks now and play it 3 or 4 times a day. Nickel Creek is on its way to the top."
5,BUY THIS CD!,"I have loved Nickel Creek since I saw them in concert with Vince Gill in Atlanta last year. They will be performing in Atlanta again tonight and I am so excited to see them!This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard!! I get chill bumps listening to their amazing harmonies and their amazing instrument playing and haunting lyrics. And they are just going to get better. I think my favorite song is ""When You Come Back Down"" followed by ""A Lighthouse Tale"". You have to buy this CD if you don't already have it!!"
5,Maybe the best album ever,"If someone told me I could only keep one album of all the albums I've bought in the last ten years, this is definitely the one I would keep. I've listened to it practically non-stop since I bought it a month ago and I know I'll listen to it many times more.What suprises me the most is that while I love the vocals, especially ""Reasons Why"" and ""Sweet Afton,"" I love the instrumentals even more. ""Robin & Marian"" is my favorite song on the album, although they are all wonderful. I'd describe the instrumentals as ""joyous."" Listening to this album is a sure mood lifter.You cannot possibly go wrong buying this CD. It crosses many genres and has something to appeal to everyone."
2,Nickel Creek,"Since Chris Thile is a member of this band, I got two of their CDs. NICKEL CREEK and THIS SIDE. Music reviews can be so subjective, can't they? They're technically quite accomplished musicians, but somehow they bore me. I can't explain it. They just don't touch me in what the locals would call my deep heart. Same problem I have with Brahms. Sorry, mate."
3,Gets Boring,"I have to agree with devobuzz3 about it getting boring after while. It's very nice and soothing when you first listen to it. But after a couple more times, I lost interest very quickly."
1,Very disappointing.,"It is the number of errors in this book that I find so frustrating! It seems obvious that no one took the time to proofread it. I picked up this book to do some french revision and by the time I got up to lesson 8, was ready to throw it in the trash. Accent marks are used only sporadically (sometimes ecrire, sometimes écrire...) They especially seem to have problems with ""la rue Whitehall"". In the french text, It appears as ""la Whitehall street""!The pluralization errors have been irritating, too. If this is intended to teach a beginning student proper French, I feel it will do nothing but confuse him/her.I do NOT recommend this book."
2,French Made Simple doesn't live up to it's title.,"I started my effort to learn the language with this book. After much effort and many hours, I almost made it through. I learned much, but this is a painful, tedious way to get there. I recently stumbled upon ""Fast French"" by Adrienne, which is finally putting it all together for me. I wouldn't recommend anyone rely on ""French Made Simple""."
4,A GREAT BOOK FOR A FRENCH INSTRUCTOR,"This book has a few mistakes like many books in that field but it's a great book for students to have during the class. And if you teach a French class it's a very convenient book for reading practices and explaining French grammar rules. Vocabulary building and ""les exercices"" are also well done. I am a French native so it helps a lot for my students for readings and learning grammar rules but I found out that with this book it's very easy and fun to teach French. Of course as a French instructor you will have to add your ""savoir faire"". It worked fine so far, using this book some of my students (motivated - no previous studies in French - age range: 25/30) became fluent in less than a year, with a good command of the language within 5 months.When you order that book make sure to order the new revised edition (1990)- ISBN 0385265212 (too bad Amazon does not show the ISBN number when you order a used book)."
3,Needs an audio tape,"There is an abundance of good material in this book, includingmany French language passages. If I could be listening to anaudio tape while reading the words, it would be so much better.There is not enough pronunciation aid in the book. There couldbe twice as much."
2,Too slow and randomly written; poor teaching tool,"This book assumes students of French cannot learn rules of grammar. It is a slow, plodding work that teaches by memorization. It does not start out, for example, with the rules for determining the gender of French nouns. If you do not know the gender of a noun, you cannot figure out the articles, etc., that go with the word. There are occasional ""rules"" in the lessons, but they are not organized in a coherent fashion. This book is suited to people who have no capacity for learning rules of grammar, and who have oodles of time to kill."
4,frontier post,"A model local military history and an introduction to the colonial era of southwest Michigan. For nearly a century this fortified trading post served as a staging point or a target for French, British, Spanish, American, and Native American ambitions in the western country. It participated in the Fox Wars, fell during Pontiac's Rebellion, and was twice raided during the American Revolution. The authors succeed in creating that context, while drawing upon the sparse local records to paint a picture of the French and Indian inhabitants (mainly Potawatomi) and the physical site."
4,forgootten 'toons,brings back memeories watching these cartoons whe my brother and i were kids..just wished there were additional episodes that we remmbered but were not on the tape..also wish the original sound track was available..(classical music(..otherwise a great value and very enjoyable
3,expensive,"I really love this calender. The pictures are bright, I have plenty of room to write in birthdays and my schedule. However, it is a almost twice as much as the other calendars I was looking at."
5,Organizational Heaven,"I bought these for my husband whos favorite thing, next to me, are office supplies. He wanted something for taking forms to and from work in the rain. (He bikes everywhere.) These work so well at keeping dirt and water off his important papers that he uses them for everything from transporting to storing his paper and small objects."
3,"Enjoyable, if uninspired.","In some ways, this is a disappointing book. It starts off VERY strongly, throwing a lot of pieces to a fairly intricate puzzle into the air and juggling them alomst effortlessly. This excitement doesn't last, unfortunately, as interesting characters that you want to root for start dying and you're stuck with a likeable caricature that is not compelling enough to fulfill the role of main supporting character. Plus, Turlough's characterization seems to have melded with Fitz's in the eighth Doctor adventures and the ending is practically a case study for the term ""anti-climax"".On the positive side, the fifth Doctor, Tegan and the Brigadier come across really well in this story and the interplay between the humans and the aliens, mixed in with the double deals and back-stabbing, make for gripping reading. All in all, it's good. It's not breathtaking or amazing, but you will enjoy reading it."
1,Caution!,"This book would sadden the Doctor himself. Doctor Who has always been about friendship and respect. It is one of the last bastions for good,innocent adventure, something you wouldn't be afraid to leave out for the neighbors to see. But this book is not one you would want your kids to get hold of. There is far too much negative sexual aggression in it. ...P>This is _not_ Doctor Who!If you're into cyperpunk or dark fantasy this may be your type of book. If you're expecting a good Doctor Who story this is not it."
3,Not as creative as the Christmas series,I was very excited about this book when I first heard about it. I love the Christmas series and have several other cookbooks from them and love them dearly! This book just didnt live up to the other books I have though.Most of the recipes in this book seem to be repetitions of recipes from their other books. There are a few things that are different and new but if you have any of their other books you probably have a recipe for 90% of the items offered.Also the crafting ideas just arent as inspiring as their Christmas crafts. I have enjoyed decorating my home for the holidays with the help of Gooseberry but this just didnt have the same origionality as the other books.Maybe they just spread themselves too thin trying to cover one whole year in one book. But I think if you have any of their other books than you can pass on this one.
5,GOOSEBERRY PATCH CELEBRATE THE SEASONS,"I LOVED THIS BOOK. ESPECIALLY THE CRAFTS. I MADE THE ""GIVE THANKS"" SAMPLER AND IT WAS EASY AND EVERYONE LOVES IT. THIS IS MY SECOND GOOSEBERRY PATCH BOOK, AND I WILL BE BUYING MORE."
3,I don't know yet.,"I just received this item a little while ago but I could not say how well it works, sorry. Received it but it turns out my lap top has another problem where I am unable to use this for now. I will update as soon as I fix this problem."
5,Nicely done with a spiritual influence,"Of the Kinkade pieces I purchased, this was the best music box. There is a sense of awe in the painting on the underside of the lid. The Nativity scene is intricate and reverent. It has an elegance about it that further complements the spiritual nature it portrays. I was VERY pleased with this piece. The sound is good and it plays the whole song unlike two others that just played one line over and over. A true Christmas collectible that you will glad to own or give to someone special."
3,No off switch,"Appearance wise, this is a beautiful music box. The music is nice--in tune--although it has a short repeat. I bought this as a gift and had no time to find another or I would have sent it back because once the movement is wound up, it must run down completely. There is no switch on the bottom and no little button on the lid. It just plays and plays and plays. I'm surprised that something so beautiful is missing such a minor feature."
2,UNNECESSARY,"This CD was a popular alternative to Bowie's thinly-mixed version of Raw Power for many years, but now that Iggy's superior sounding re-mixed Raw Power is out there really is no need to buy this CD unless you are a diehard collector. The first seven songs (same sequence as the Raw Power CD minus Shake Appeal) sound good, but the numerous alternate takes are horrible sounding. Buy the re-mixed Raw Power instead, and if you're curious about the alternate takes, check out the Studio Sessions CD - three of the alternate takes appear here as well as other outtakes from the Raw Power recording sessions - it's a much more interesting CD."
2,Muffled and Unremarkable,"This selection of Stoogiana is worth a pass. The demos herein are not up to standard, and the production sounds as it were strained through cheese cloth, a Melita filter, and petroleum jelly. Get Iggy's remixed ""Raw Power"" and know what recorded mayhem should be."
2,Historical value,"This CD is not exactly what it promises to be. Maybe the first seven tracks really are the original, pre-Bowie mixes of the album, but not with the sound quality they would have been released for sure! They don't sound as if they were taken from the original tape. By today's standards, they have near-bootleg quality. So buy this CD for what it is: a piece of history. You'll enjoy listening to the alternate mixes and the radio show. Unfortunately, the best version of ""Raw Power"" is still the originally released one, which may not be available anymore. The version available at the time of writing has allegedly been remixed by Iggy himself, but not for the better."
4,"Good Idea, but unfortunatley, many NOT original recordings","Contrary to a previous review, many of these themes are remakes.Just to name a few I Love Lucy, Dragnet, The Honeymooners, Alfred Hitchcock,Bewitched. But there are several that are original, such as Flinstones, Adams Family, Gilligans Island, Monkees, Brady Bunch, Six Feet under, and a few more. So this comp is touch and go. I have been collecting themes for 35 years, and I have never found a comp with ALL ORIGINAL THEMES."
2,underwhelming,"The cover of this collection of classic TV themes makes it look like it's a winner, but when you see the track listing and listen to the compilation overall, it's very disappointing.The collection has gathered popular TV theme songs but there are so many that you do want that are not here: Facts of Life, Different Strokes, Maude...a lot of the kitschy songs are omitted, preventing this from becoming a true guilty pleasure. Stick with the Television Themes series. Much better!"
2,TV Guide TV Themes CD,I was expecting the original TV Theme music on this CD - it was not. These reproductions are not as good.
2,No Mod Squad? Plus Fake Versions...,"Wow, I was greatly disappointed in this product. Who wants re-recorded versions of these songs?"
3,Some left out,"I bought this CD for my husband's 50th birthday because of the theme from Hawaii Five-O. It seemed kind of silly to have all those TV theme songs on a CD, but when you sit down and they play one after the other, they bring you back in time and it's kind of fun. There are a few great ones, however, that could have been included on this CD, but were not such as the theme from Big Valley and Star Trek."
4,Good TV Themes,"I found this cd at an FYE store and looked on the back and i was both happy and a little upset. When I saw that it did not have my favorite ""The Incredible Hulk"" theme, I was really shocked because i love the piano theme. But, this cd does have a REALLY GREAT amount of material, such as another favorite of mine, "" The Dick van Dyke Show"" theme."
3,Chico Snubbed Mannnn!,"This is an overall good cd; but there's no way The theme from: ""CHICO AND THE MAN"" should have been left out! As well, the themes from SWAT, BeRETTA, AND FAMILY TIES......iT'S TIME FOR TV THEMES vol.2"
3,"Well, they DO cut biscuits...","Ok, these crinkle biscuit cutters were cheap. I shouldn't complain when they were so cheap. All they're supposed to do is cut a bunch of biscuits, so no big whoop, right? But they are awfully shallow. By that I mean the cutting part is less than an inch high. The nicer cutters are taller, at least an inch and half, sometimes two inches high. I guess that's what I was expecting.Will it make that much of a difference just cutting a bunch of biscuits? Probably not. But expectations are a funny thing. In this case, mine were a bit disappointed. But they are just biscuit cutters and they are metal and they do cut biscuits, so I'll try not to complain too much here.<sigh>"
1,Sizes in product description are INCORRECT,"The description says the smallest cutter has a 1.25"" diameter. It is actually well over 2"". Now I need to return these because I was looking for a much smaller cutter."
4,A good collection of projects for the amateur astronomer,"This book was written in the early 80s but is still useful today as a guide to how an amateur astronomer can contribute to the science. It covers many observing topics in-depth and explains how to document findings: variable stars, double star orbits, sunspots, asteroid light curves, comets. The book also contains a section on photography and the use of a couple handy instruments that are now probably outdated.I read the book but haven't actually begun any of the projects covered in it, mainly because I just like to observe with my telescope and not get mired in the science. However, the book did help me become more familiar with the use of telescopes as scientific instruments and not just as windows on the universe."
4,A good basic book.,I've had this book for many years and despite the fact some of the info is outdated I still find this book very useful. After observing this is still the first book I use for reference.
2,How do you define an amateur?,"If you are brand new to astronomy, say have your first telescope and want to learn more, think twice before buying this book. Or, any book for that matter. I have yet to find a book that begins with the very basics and works from there. (Just ordered Astronomy for Dummies, in hopes this will meet my requirement).My experience so far is that astronomy books are densely written, and begin with complex concepts and terminology. This one is no different.Also note how old this book is. I suspect, but don't know, that it needs to be updated."
4,Crazy English,"Recently I read the book Crazy English by Richard Lederer for a school project. I thought it was a very interesting book and it really did explain why our English language is so crazy. My favorite part of the book was the Tense Times with Verbs secetion. There were very good poems written in this chapter to help explain and give examples of how our language doesn't make sense sometimes. Another good portion of the book is The Sounds of English, it talks about the many different letters that have different sounds and the words that have mute letters, or silent letters. It has a very indepth perspective of many different sounds and why they are spelled and said the way they are. Overall, I thought this was a very educational book and interesting to read."
5,Great Soundtrack,"That Soundtrack grooves, as the film did.I always have a great time when I listen to it. My favouriteis the song when you hear Gerd Froebe singing. I hope futur brings such great Composers back as the Sherman brothers were. Not only loud boom - booms as Hans Zimmer or Howard Shore, for example, dare to present us today."
2,A Missed Opportunity!,"While I do love this movie, and the songs from it, this CD is a sad example of a missed opportunity. This CD was released a few years ago with dialogue in-between the songs. Its now more like the original LP from 1968, but far from complete. If they truly wanted to release a great ""Special Edition"" soundtrack, they should have included the fantastic score by Irwin Kostal/Sherman Bros. I have heard the ""isolated score"", and in some ways it is better than some of the songs. Maybe they will get it right for the 70th Anniversary!"
4,Great!!,"Even though the first release of the soundtrack was better, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD. I have loved this movie since I was a child, and I loved the music to it! This is one of those CD's that you never get tired of listening to. Anyone who loves Chitty Chitty Bang Bang must have this soundtrack!!"
3,"Good, but a missed chance.",While I do enjoy the film and the music they really missed the chance for a great CD by cuting out the score (Doll on a Music Box has the worst cut ever) and not having better sound quality.
1,Great voices badly mastered,"Fishermen's Friends have excellent vocal control, lovely harmonies and a rugged tone that makes most of their CD a pleasure to listen to. The melodies get stuck in my head and I don't mind the kids listening (and singing along) to most of it. The problem is simply that this CD is created from a bad master, which leads to audio glitches on Leave Her Johnny Leave Her, a buzzing sound during Grey Funnel Line and skips all the way through the title track, Home from the Sea. It is a shame that an otherwise beautiful album is so error-stricken. Try a different album or skip over those three songs."
2,OK not the best,"The CD,it only has a few good songs like ""I'm a Believer"",""Heart and Soul"",""Listen To The Band"",and ""(I'm Not Your)Steppin Stone,besides that its all down hill.A couple of songs on it were made after Peter left.""Ceiling In My Room"" really brings it down."
4,A top cult movie of the Seventies!,"A professional hit man, accurately portrayed by Donald Sutherland is unable to make the assigned mission due his wife has disappeared. He firmly suspects about a top manin the Organization has to do with this weird fact.Exciting film from start to end."
1,Don't waste your time,"Decent movie with poor to bad acting, but it never ended. Just left you hanging. Confusing. Would have been a 3 star movie if it at least gave some indication of who/what was going on."
1,Skip it.,"Have a friend tell you half of a good story, then stop. Like this movie it will leave you with alot of questions. 100% bad, the movie makes no sence."
2,good while it lasts.,This is a replacement for a previous one that just quit. As did the previous one. They don't seem to last very long.
1,Not Stock Product Don't Buy,I DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING THIS NON WEBER MADE kit.The kit was sent to me in a beat-up Postal envelop. Had I known this was somebodies punch-out kit I would never of bought it.No idea if it will work at all.Bob
2,"""Made In China""","I bought this kit and was happy that I received it within the week. The part I really needed in the kit, the diaphram, was fine , but three of the gaskets were torn in spots, so I ended up using the old one that I had saved when I took the carburetor apart. It is what it is, but not what I expected. Lucky I could use the old gasket."
1,not my rating,"This is not my rating, its my 18 month old daughters. This product was rated high and all, which is how I buy baby stuff on Amazon. My dauther could care less about this book. I've tried it a bunch of times and she tosses it right over her shoulder. She also loves Raffi, though, so what does she know?"
1,Bad quality,"I have not red the book yet - my review is based on the condition I received the book in. It has black marker on it, is dirty and is clearly second hand, despite paying for and expecting a new book."
3,Wanted a way to diffuse my essential oils,Wanted a way to diffuse my essential oils I bought at the spa. Good size. Look great. Only problem is since the bottom is glazed the oils really don't come through and the scent is not dispensed the way I'd hoped.
4,The Cinematography cover all the weaknesses of the movie,"I know some people think the plot is not as strong as the other Bertoluci's movies. However in my opinion, the cinematography of this movies are too good to be true. If you like the cinematography of the English Patient, you probably will love this movie."
4,Tea in the Sahara,"Tea in the Sahara, Tea with Bernardo Bertolucci, Tea with John Malkovich, Debra Winger, and Eric Vu-An A plush desert, sounds ironic, doesn't it But, no better word comes to mind The richness and depth of the actors The exotic landscape The beautiful blue sky by day and full moon at night The charming culture of the Arab locals The strong beautiful French accent Buildings so quaint and antiquated Gradual assimilation into the Sahara Feeds human hunger for exotic adventureProfound, leaving you wanting more!Eric Vu-An! Bel etranger avec Africain un sourire I want more!"
4,Why isn't this on DVD?,"Can somebody out there please put this film on DVD? It's incredible! The cinematography, the acting, the direction, everything. And where in the world has Debra Winger been? Doesn't she make films anymore? Please. DVD!"
1,Stick a fork in it,"Terrible, terrible movie. It goes nowhere for no purpose. Would appeal to people who find wealthy, grown men and women pissing and moaning about the fact that they're shallow pukes, cute."
3,nice try but not quite,"There's a beautiful film in here which captures all of the passion, beauty, horror, and mental devastation of the novel. Unfortunately, you've to wait an hour and a half to get to it. Only when the miscast actors stop talking (i.e. Malkovich dies) does the real story begin, and what a great story it is. The lost American loses her ability to communicate and what's left is the image, the essence, the grand surrounding. As vast as it is empty, the setting envelops and virtually kills the old self, a new one (or an old one docile) emerges but she too can cope only slightly. The score here is wonderful if perhaps wrong. The cinematography is about what you'd expect from Vittorio (ne c'est pas rein si no par excellence). Bertolucci has always been at his best when he let the strange silences and voids of human communication (with himself, the environment, etc.) take over...this is no exception. The film is wonderful, but only after the drunkeness of the first hour and a half."
2,A bore.,"Beautiful cinematography but dull movie, with bad acting and stunted dialogue. I like Bertolucci , but this is his Hollywood production and it shows."
5,One of my favorite movies of all times.,This movie is a classic. I love it. It really gives a feeling of being lost in a foreign country. Sometimes good and mostly not so good.
2,THE SHELTERING SKY,"long, depressing, and very slow moving movie. You did get the idea that it was very hot in the Saharas."
2,"Tedious, pointless movie","The Sheltering Sky may be the most tedious movie I've ever seen. The characters are terribly dysfunctional and the movie never explains why, nor does it resolve the dysfunctionality in their relationships. The plot drags and even the action doesn't take the story anywhere. The end is terribly unsatisfying. Finally, the high-pitched noises the extras make are simply unbearable."
2,Edited to Death,I remember seeing this movie when it first came out; I was intrigued to find it on DVD. However the DVD edition has been edited so harshly that it has totaly trashed the context of the story. I didn't recognize what I was watching; yes the great desert scapes are still there but the story and plot have been destroyed by the editor.
4,Grand illusion,"This film is not for realists. Like an abstract or even impressionist painting, the viewer must allow for the emotional and sensual to speak to you. There is another main character in this film...the desert and culture of the place and time. It is more forceful than the self-absorbed personalities of any of the others. Ultimately it consumes them all. And that is also the theme of this movie."
4,Will someone translate this for me please?,"Tillie Olson is a brilliant woman. She was way ahead of her time, breaking through the constraints binding talented women back then by her sheer persistence and follow-through, becoming recognized as a notable author. Her insights regarding women authors of the 19th century are brilliant. And her story ""Tell Me A Riddle"" is a classic.However, her words sometime seem to start from the middle of a conversation, back up against one another, fall over themselves and then make a circuitous route to sometimes puzzling conclusions. ""Tell Me A Riddle"" occasionally found me shaking my head as if to dislodge some buzzwords that were way too loud and confusing. Although I understood the gist of this powerful story, I found its delivery to be irritating.Perhaps that is the way Tillie Olsen writes. However, despite the brilliance of her observations, I find her writing style too discordant."
5,Palm OS/Tungston Vs Pocket PC/Ipaq,"I have been a palm user and been using mono (B&W;) palm for past 3 yrs. Then I decided to go color and start looking at options (this was before palm released tungsten E), I looked at palm, sony, HP but couldn't find what I need at reasonable price. Then HP released IPAQ 1945, it has lots of features but price was a bit high.Then almost simultaneously palm released tungsten E and HP Ipaq 1935, they both were priced same (after ipaq MIR rebate), both has tons of features and prices just right. I spend 2-3 days reading their review and going to store and playing around with for hrs and finally decided to go for Palm.Here are the reason of choosing palm tungsten E over IPAQ 19351) Its much easier to use and even faster to learn2) It has better screen resolution3) Looks better, cool design4) Light weight5) Good battery life6) lastly doesn't run Pocket PC and crash like IPAQ.For the Price Vs features look no further and It's a Palm OS 5."
2,Veteran Palm User Very Disappointed,"The Tungsten E is my fourth Palm and I loved them all. I began with the orignal Palm Pilot. My Tungsten E is awful. The Palm OS is still the best, but something has happend with manufacturing quality control. The power button problem, heard about often in reviews, showed up within months. Mine no longer operates at all. I turn it on by using the other buttons and need to let it shut itself off using the time-out function. This, of course, makes poor battery life even worse.The other major problem is that I can no longer even use graffiti because the sensitivity in the writing area of the screen is all but gone, despite the fact that I used protective screens on it. I now have to use the typewritter screen to enter data.At this point I'm so upset with Palm that I can't see rewarding them by buying another as a replacement."
3,"Disappointing, I miss my Vx","I was always very pleased with my Palm V and then later my Palm Vx. True, they both fritzed out after about 2 years, but during that time, they were very functional. This model is disappointing. I already had to return my first ones because the buttons didn't work well, and then the buttons on the second one stopped working just after the warranty period expired. The The worst part of it is that Grafitti doesn't work well at all; I don't know if this is becuase of this model, or is the new Grafitti program. It does not come with a cradle - not the end of the world, but it's inconvenient. The battery life is weak. It is fast and I like the screen, but that's about it. Overall I would not recommend this model."
5,Treat yourself!,"If you're thinking of upgrading from an older black & white Palm, treat yourself. I had a much loved Palm 105 that was perfectly adequate. However, the Tungsten E is a joy. The display is superb and the range of features extraordinary for the price.My only gripe and it's a minor one is that if you're used to six weeks' life from AAA batteries, you have to get used to a weekly recharge of the lithium battery. Palm claim that 'average' usage is 20 minutes/day. If you use it for much longer than 20 minutes, you'll be recharging frequently.Palm really do have a winner here."
1,Warning!,"I purchased two of these PDA's less than two weeks ago, and both are officially dead. Neither will charge, despite different types of resets, replacement units, horrible customer service, etc. From my experience with Palm and the forums hosted on their own site, many many people have had issues very similar to this. There is talk of filing a class action suit. Buyer beware!"
3,A usable PDA,"Positives: Tungsten E has been a zippy and durable PDA in my use over the last 2 years. The screen resolution is excellent and the processor speed is more than adequate. I never cared for wireless connection, so to me it was not an issue.Negatives: the screen makes an audible and very annoying high pitched noise (if you read blogs over the internet, it is a pervasive and highly annoying problem -- one that Palm has been unwilling or unable to address). I guess this is what you get when your electronics are made in China;The onboard memory of 32 Mb is frankly inadequate for 2007; installation of applications to memory card dramatically slows their access speed"
3,Not too bad,I have had a tungsten e for almost 2 years. (My previous Handspring died in an auto accident.) I haven't had any real problems. It mostly does what it is supposed to. My biggest issue is that the charger is not dual voltage and a meager 90 day warrenty. My daughter has a tungsten e. Her power switch broke. The cost of repair is such that it cheaper to by a new one. I was able to disasemble the device ( no help from the Palm website ) and solder a broken contact back in place. Quite a feat with an old Radio Shack soldering iron. So far it still works.Another gripe is that they keep changing cables. I am exploring a device for my wife and I find the the cable for mine will not fit a new device. Not too smart if they are attempting to build customer loyalty. I am very unimpressed with the reported non support from palm. I would second others that over the years Amaazon has been very good to deal with.
1,DON'T BUY THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK,"I only used my Tgunsten E about 20 times before the battery stopped holding a charge. Now it only works if it's plugged into the wall. Palm Support was no help -- and for a mere $125, I could send it in for a new battery, which is hardly worth it. This PDA is a rip-off, a worthless piece of junk that anyone looking for a useful PDA should avoid."
1,DANGER! Buyer Beware...,"I've owned my Tungsten E for less than a year, and I am very displeased with it's performance for a variety of reasons, but most of all because of its defective battery system. The unit always had a problem holding a charge for more than a day or so, but now, it literally will not work at all after being away from its power cord for more than a few minutes. This, of course, renders the unit completely worthless, since it only works when plugged into the wall. Oh, and by the way, Palm sells this product with only a 3 month warranty (as opposed to their usual 12 month warranty). But don't worry, their phone operators will be happy to speak to you about any problems you might have for a standard $25 fee. I will never buy Palm products again, and would advise you to consider the same."
1,What is it good for when it breaks down?,"Like many of you, over the years I've bought many electronic products. But not one of them broke down within 6 months of use except this palm Tungsten E. When I originally made my decision to buy this model, I liked the look, design and expected a lot from this little handheld computer. But little did I pay any attention to the warranty. IT IS THE ONLY TUNGSTEN THAT HAS 90 DAYS WARRANTY. Other models all have 1 year. Pretty smart Palm! Obviously they figured out this one can't last long.Ok, about the problem. It won't turn on any more, no matter what you do, soft reset, hard reset, etc. I figure it's either the power switch or the screen. But would you pay more than half the price to get it fixed and patentially have the same problem happen again?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A LONG TERM HANDHELD!!!,I bought a Tungsten E about 8 months ago...the unit started not being able to hold a charge for very long at 5 months. The battery went completely dead 2 months later. You cannot replace the battery yourself without soldering it and Palm will only replace the battery if you pay 125 dollars plus shipping!! I will never buy a palm ever again.....
2,Functionality is good -- before it breaks down,"Two weeks ago my third Palm in six years broke down. The first one was my own fault, I dropped it on the floor and the display cracked. The second one was a Tungsten E which lasted a little less than 2 years. Then it started to behave erratically, leading to a complete breakdown. Because I assumed it was some bad luck I experienced, I purchased another Palm, this time a Tungsten 2E. It has functioned for about 2 years, then when I wanted to switch it on, it remained black. Dead.I loved the functionality, and I am really helpless without the hundreds of contacts, my to-do list and my agenda. But a PDA has to be reliable.The Tungsten doesn't come exactly cheap either. What happened to the price? As far as I can recall, the last Tungsten I bought for $200,- or so. Factory new, not refurbished. Now I have to pay over $400 for something which typically breaks down within two years? Is this a joke or so?"
3,Not customer fix it friendly,"Product works. But when something as simple as a battery has to be changed it has to be sent in for repair. We bought another one thinking it was cheaper that way. Seller was marvelous, best service ever BUT this should have been a simple fix, not a major event. This product is not made anymore, any wonder! Wish we were warned when we bought our first one in 2002."
3,palm tungsten E review,Everything works fine except the button that allows you to scroll down. It does not work. I would love to get another palm to replace this one.
5,Great for a MAC user!!,I purchased this for my wife. She loves it. We own a Mac with OS X their was no additional software to install it works great. I do however wish it came with a cradle. I would recommed this to any mac user who wants a pda with all of the basic features.
4,A Solid Performer,"In the past few months Palm Computing has divided into PalmSource, focussing on the software, and PalmOne, handling the hardware. I found that the PalmOne Tungsten E Handheld is quite possibly the best handheld PC from PalmOne to date.While the 126MHz Texas Instruments OMAP311 processor may not be as fast as other Handheld PCs and the 32M of memory is nothing spectacular, there is a handy SD expansion capability. What really stands out, however, is the wide range of features. Running Palm OS 5.2.1, it comes with Kinoma Player and Kinoma Producer, allowing the creation of AVI and QuickTime movies. Other features include a 3.5mm headphone socket (stereo) and a 320 by 320-pixel screen resolution (16 bit), which is surprisingly bright. An MP3 player, Mac OS support and optional wireless culminate in a Handheld PC that is affordable and feature rich- a good buy indeed."
2,No cradle is a problem,"I was flabbergasted to discover (to my dismay, after I bought) that there is no cradle for this device. I will jury-rig something, but I find the omission inexcusable."
3,Did the basics,"Palm Pilot Tungsten E - It was a good product initially but once you upgrade your computer software to Windows 7 all is lost. You can no longer sync your Palm Pilot. If you don't have your information somewhere else, ""TOO BAD"" ! Also, if your Palm Pilot is not constantly recharged, like you forget about it for a few days. Then ""ALL"" is lost. There is no recovery. So, Palm Pilot should have some sort of restore software when you switch to a new operating system or the charge runs out...... This is ""DEFINITELY"" a draw back to owning a Palm Pilot !!!!"
5,Replacement Palm,"This PalmOne Tungsten E Handheld is a replacement for one that I've had for many, many years. The old unit finally bit the dust and I couldn't imagine using another product to keep track of my many appointments and my address book. I'm not into smart phones with address book and calendar options since I really don't want to surf the Web or view emails on a handheld unit and that seems to be what everyone wants to sell me. My Palm is the right product for my life and I'm thrilled to still find a new replacement unit still being marketed."
2,What you get is Not what you see from Amazon,"I ordered a Palm Tungsten from Amazon / Renew Electronics. What is in the picture is not what you get. This Palm is cheap, no serial number, color on screen is very poor. What a reap off for a $129.00 plus freight.Samson"
3,Broken Power Adapter = No Charge,"While the PALM was delivered promptly with itsdisk, power & hot sync cord the power cord wasdefective so I was never able to tell if the PALMfunctioned properly. Amazon assisted in the returnand credit to my credit card."
5,Satisfied with vendor,The product arrived on time and was more then I expected. The vendor included items that were not in the original order. Included were a case and wireless keyboard. Vendor went beyond meeting my needs. Would recomend to a friend. Would buy from this vendor again.
5,A computer indeed,"I just got this palm and it is exactly what I was looking for and when I read it had the functions I needed I bought it, it was my first palm or PDA, and my new useful toy. So I can work and store word documents, transfer file by infrared from other laptops and work on documents, have a powerpoint presentation and go to a conference without having to have a computer. It is a computer on the go and so small, has games, I can organize my expenses, share photos, play games, if only there were really good ebooks available, I would love to read them in it, travel guides, etc. too bad there arent.I hated to have to go everywhere with a lot of papers, now this is all I need. I still have not used the MP3 functions, because I need separate accesories. Only bad thing, no keyboard, I guess with a keyboard, nobody will need laptops anymore!"
1,Negative 5 Stars -- WARNING -- DO NOT BUY!,"Palm has lost its edge. The Tungsten E is pure garbage. Shortly after purchase the unit stopped functioning. We sent it in to Palm for repair and it was returned even deader than before. Thought it might be the charger, so Palm sent a charger for use in Europe! When we called to ask for the correct charger we were told the part was on 10 day back order but that we could purchase direct from Palm's website and receive it by the next business day! No way will we purchase anything else made by Palm. Palm's customer service SUCKS! They've outsourced so you need to understand Farsee to speak with the customer service reps in India and Spanish to speak to the repair site in Mexico. If it was possible I'd rate the Tungsten E as NEGATIVE 5 stars. WARNING DO NOT BUY The TUNGSTEN E and if this a sample of Palm's products -- DON'T BUY A PALM!"
3,Can be used only in North America.,"A nice PDA, but the adaptor is 110 volts only so you can recharge it only in North America. It doesn't take batteries so you must recharge. There is no international adaptor kit available, so keep it at home! An international adaptor kit is listed under the Tungsten E accessories. It's excellent, but it works only with the previous Tungsten models. Why couldn't Palm have kept the same system for the E? How about some continuity?"
2,5 way keypad is cheap,"I only had this for a week or so. I love the display, the responsiveness, and features over what I had in my old Visor.But the darn 5-way keypad in the center drives me nuts! The down button didn't give feedback like the left/right/up/center, which was very annoying. I returned it last night and got a new one. All the buttons now give descent feedback, but the up button doesn't actually do anything unless it is really pressed hard. So hard, that I think I'm going to break it.Should I go back for a third try? Not sure. I may return this and wait for the next set of models to come out and keep my Visor."
1,I have purchsed (and returned) 2 of these,"I purchased a Tungsten E after my Sony Clie got dropped too many times. Received it in the mail, charged the battery as directed, ran the setup. Turned it off for the night, and the next morning could not power it on. Plugged it in, and it had lost all my information and I had to run setup again. This happened several times so I returned it and got another one. (What was I thining?!) The second one did the exact same thing. So, I am returning it and I am not sure what I will do next. But I will NOT be purchasing another Tungsten E."
1,one star only because 0 was not an option,"If anyone is interested in joining a class action lawsuit against palm for dumping this incrediby bad product on an unsuspecting public, please email me at googleboodle@hotmail.com. Palm needs to be punished."
2,Two stars only because the 2nd one worked a little better,"This device shares palms usual lack of committment to quality. I had one and it had to be returned in a few days because several features did not work. These included holding a charge and other things.The second one worked reasonably well, but it would sync and then would not sync. Nothing had changed on my computer, just the calendar date. The software seems to be very immature, even though it has been out for quite some time.Palm needs to get a grip on quality.They need to stabilize their software.They need to stop gouging the public on support of their buggy product.The only reason they have any market share is that seemingly there are no better/reasonably priced products on the market."
1,Anything Less Than One Star?,"I rate products on how they perform their advertised functions. The E performs its advertised functions but with 2 glaring flaws that make it a dud. First, the battery is of low quality. I had to take my first one back because it did not want to hold a charge after only a week. I later found out that this is a common problem. Considering you only have a 90 day warranty I would say buyer beware. Second, the screen will often crack for no apparent reason other than stress from the unit being assembled wrong at the factory. After 60 days my screen cracked for no apparent reason. It was sitting on my desk in perfect shape one moment and the screen was cracked the next. Not even the short 90 day warranty covers the screen and Palm will charge you $100 to replace the screen. If you insist on buying the E then go ahead and get ripped off further and buy the extended warranty...you will need it."
2,Great til it died,"I bought this Palm 14 months ago. I'd read all the reviews here about malfunctions but figured I would somehow beat the odds.Although the battery life was poor, I had no other complaints...until it simply stopped working. I was unable to set appointments from the desktop or do a hotsync, despite uninstalling and reinstalling the program.I have an illness that's affected my memory, so I really need something to aid me. I've always used Palm products and don't know which model to choose now. But I don't think this one is worth it in the long run."
2,disappointing Palm,"This is my third palm and the biggest disappointment. The battery life is short AND when the palm runs dead all data is GONE. You have to redo all your settings and synch. I liked the old way of setting the palm in the cradle for synching and charging. I could take it out of my purse when I got to work, set it in the cradle until I left the office. It was always charged and ready to go. This one has a bulky electrical cord to charge and a separate cable to hook to your computer to synch. This makes it more trouble to synch with home and office computers for me. I do not understand why my little cell phone doesn't lose data when it runs out of battery (and it has a warning beep) and this palm goes completely blank. It is way more trouble than it is worth. Buy a different one."
4,Tungsten E Far Surpasses the Zire 21,"The Tungsten E has a much better and clearer display. For us old folks the larger print is a god-send. The function of the Tungsten E is virtually the same as the previous PDAs but has larger memory, better battery-life and crisper clearer alphanumerics. At the new prices it is a great bargain."
2,LEMON LEMON LEMON LEMON,"I know the US has a throw-away attitude, things are built to break...but this is rediculous, this PDA only lasted a YEAR and I feel lucky reading some of the other reviews that it even lasted that long!I bought this when it first came out, a first year lemon for sure, why else would Palm now be offering the Tungsten E2?I've scanned over a few other palm models in the same price range and below...but all I see are more angry reviews...does -anyone- build a quality PDA for a fair price?Doesn't look like it, I'll be buying the cheapest replacement PDA I can find, in anticipation of it breaking."
4,Easy accesses,"Many people use their cell phones with some of this information but being in real estate I categorize all my attorneys,brokers, contractors, inspectors, active & general clients, doctors, etc........most cell phones won't let me do all this and my present Palm is ""on the way out""and trying to replace a new battery was just too confusing, so I had to get a new one...Maybe the updated Palms make this easier ..I'm sure that there are many other functions for this Palm but I do love it for my use."
2,tungsten E Palm,"I purchased a Tungsten E in 2003 and the battery was getting weak. The photograph and description on the Amazon.com web site was identical to my Palm so I purchased it. It turned out to be a different model Tungsten E. I did not return it because I do not want to deal with amazon.com anymore. I took the $140.00 loss as a learning experience and bought the Tungsten E identical to what I previously had from another reputable retailer.You will notice that the photo on the upper right hand corner of this page is the same one I relied upon as identical to what I previously purchased and was misled. The product I received only has ""Palm"" stamped on it and the finish is crude."
2,did not work,"My product ordered the PalmOne did not work on arrival and it was returned promptly and I was cedited the total amount.So, although I didn't receive a satisfactory product the interaction was completed."
1,Disappointed,"The Palm Pilot was advertised as new in box sealed, it had been refurbished and resealed, no serial number to register product. the stylus was missing, and when we got one, it will not stay in the holder, After 4 seperate tries to get the pilot to sink with our computer, we gave up... So we have to double enter all contacts, and meetings. When we went to the web site to update some programs, we kept getting the 404 error, meaning it is no longer supported.. Over all Very Disappointed..."
5,My Palm,"I've used a palm pilot for years...my Zire71 broke. I was lost until I searched amazon, puchased a used one it works great."
1,A cumbersome electronic device,Wish I had understood that you have to learn how to write letters to bring up information. What a pain in the neck in comparison to a keyboard popping up!
1,Think about this: Why do they offer just a 90 day warranty?,"Purchased in December 2003. By April 2004, battery would not hold a charge for more than a few seconds even after overnight recharging. Useless. I checked the warranty: 90 days. So I'm stuck with a $200 piece of junk that I had just started using.Generally speaking, if a company has confidence in its product, it will offer a fairly long warranty period. If they offer just a 90 day warranty, there is generally a reason why. In my opinion, Palm has no business taking $200 from a customer for a product that they has so little confidence in. So I'll look at another company for my hext handheld. What you do is, of course, up to you."
2,No guarantee,"I loved my Tungsten E at first--at least for the first 4 months; then it quit working and I had to perform a soft reset periodically. Lo and Behold! There is a REASON this is one of the 3 Palm PDAs that only has a 90 day warranty as opposed to a ONE YEAR warranty. It quit about 10 days after the warranty was up. Now, I have to perform a soft reset every single time I start up, which makes it highly impractical for whipping out and entering a Dr. apt or phone number on the spot. I am very unhappy because all this info will be lost unless I purchase ANOTHER Palm product. I suppose a solution would be to take my chances with another Tungsten E, which I am happy with WHEN IT'S WORKING, and purchase an extended warranty. Or I could buy a Tunsten T3 for an additional $200 and get the 1 year warranty. Or get another brand and lose 6 months of data. So annoying."
1,Amazon info doesn't list the SHORT 90 day warranty,"The only way I found out about the 90 day warranty and shoddy customer service was to read the reviews that customers have provided. Amazingly, Amazon does not list this info in the technical data or anywhere else I could find it. I have to say that I am very disappointed in Amazon for this lapse."
2,Differences to other Palm devices,"If you are considering this device, please be aware of several differences from many of the other palm organizers currently available.1. The screen on this unit seems to be much softer than the other palm units I have owned. In my opinion it is too easily scratched.2. The warranty period for this unit is only 90 days. After that you might as well buy a new unit.3. This unit uses the OMAP processor. I have encountered several software vendors whose products will not run on this unit."
3,Lack of a dock is annoying,"I like almost everything about my new Tungsten|E, but I really hate the use of a mini-USB connector for docking.I have four problems with it:1. Instead of a friendly cradle on my desk, I now have to manage two messy wires (power and USB).2. Instead of a convenient drop-in action that gets me charged and synced, I have to take the extra time to plug and unplug the two connectors each and every time.3. I find the mini USB connector to be somewhat finicky, and occasionally hotsync doesn't work until I unplug/replug it.4. Most incredibly, a wide variety of Palm peripherals are NOT COMPATIBLE with this unit, due to the lack of the universal connector.Now that I know about this, I have been recommending against this model, and I will be looking for this in my future purchases."
3,Beware of MultiMedia expansion cards,"I made a mistake with ""others also bought"" link on this page.The SimpleTech Multimedia card will not store MP3's.Be sure to get a Secure Digital card for songs !"
5,Impressed,"I am a physician and previously used a Palm Vx (until the battery died). I have been impressed with the high resolution color screen and the additional utilities. The Tungsten E comes with Documents-to-go software for Word/Excel/Powerpoint files and Photo viewing software which are extremely user-friendly. I anticipated having to struggle to set these programs up, but they worked on my first attempt. I have been using the Tungsten E for the last month and still very happy with my decision."
4,Decent,"This handheld was adequate for me, but honestly it depends on what your needs are. I upgraded to this from my previous model and primarily use the basics(appointment book, memos, to do list).To be honest I was a little afraid of this at first. My previous handheld was one of the old school Palm m105's and this one just didn't feel quite as durable. This one is definitely improved with it's 320x320 color screen. I think the screen color is one of the greatest features of this model, you can color code your appointments so that you can tell what your day looks like at a quick glance.If you are currently looking for a new Palm I would look at one of the newer models. I really can't comment on Palm's service because I've never had a problem with a product. Several of my friends have gone through service tech hell trying to get things replaced so I would heed other customer's warnings and horror stories."
1,BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK,"I purchased my Tungsten E Handheld in January and yesterday,March 23,the handheld would not turn on. I tried to work through Palm Customer support since it is covered for 90 days from date of purchase and WHAT A NIGHTMARE. If you speak Indian or Pakistani you may be ok but, it was like talking to a machine with no clue of what you are attempting to describe to them. Everything was like scripted... so... I contacted Amazon and EUREKA!!! in spite of their 30 day return policy, they are sending me a replacement unit. Let's see how long this one will function; after reading some of the other reviews, probably not to long. I bought this based on positive reviews and now it seems I have purchased an expensive piece of junk. DO NOT BUY PALM PRODUCTS BUT, DO TRUST THAT AMAZON WILL TREAT YOU RIGHT."
1,Useless without a Keyboard,"A great piece of engineering with a fatal flaw - no keyboard - (those wireless take for ever things do not count)Let me understand this - this is targeted at the professional market. So I bought one. now it is three months later and they can't even produce a keyboard to sell with this thing.Dear fellow professionals, save your shekels and buy a Sony Clie - at least Sony provides adequate accessories and it is a highly competitive product.I regret purchasing this"
3,Kind Of Sucks....,you can't expand this handheld in any way except for memory....NO GPS or MP3's **without another $99.99 kit**SUCKS................
2,woops,These aren't new and as a result it's quirky (the screen only lights up on one half at times). I just restart it and it comes on full screen though. I just wonder how long it will last.
2,Needs Cradle,"This Palm does not come with a docking cradle, which makes HotSync'ing cumbersome. It also prevents integration with add-on devices such as GPS. Not up to Palm's usual standards!"
2,Palm Tungsten E Problems,"I've had nothing but problems with BOTH of the Tungsten E's that I purchased. The first one lost all of my data about once a month, would turn on by itself, and have to be reset regularly. The cost to have it repaired was over 50% of the purchase price. I like the software and ease of use of the product and hoped the problem was only a bad battery. So I bought a second Tungsten E. I could never even get it to turn on. I would recommend looking at other manufacturers."
3,No GPS for this Palm.,"DO NOT BUY THIS Palm if you wish to connect other equipment to your Palm. Per Palm ""Tungsten E does not support connectivity"". I bought the Tungsten E for my wife for christmas, planning to use it with my GPS now and then. I was suprised after shipping to find that there is no way to connect anything to this Palm."
1,Palm One,Unable to get it to work. I have tried everything recomended. Perhaps you can help me. If so send me an e-mail.
1,1 star is too much!! Read this,"Battery life is very short, software is slow and when it goes out of charge you lose all the data (except what's in the memory card) and you have to reinstall the software. On top of that BE AWARE that if you have any problem after 90 days, you will have to buy a new Palm (if you like the idea) since the repairing costs are $125+$39.99 + taxes. To call the Technical Assistance you have to add $25. My Palm after only 8 months does not turn on anymore and since batteries are non-user replaceable Lithium, my only option is to buy a new PDA, NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE A PALM.A lot of other clients had my same problem and this could really be a defective product.I want to underline the outstanding quality of Amazon's Customer Service, not responsible for the insulting low quality of this product. It will be a great pleasure for me to keep make my purchases on this site and I suggest it to all my friends."
2,"Died after 30 days, horrible customer service","I've used Palms for 5 years. For thirty days this Palm was a dream. Then one morning it just was dead.Now the last time I had a Palm die under warranty, 4 years ago or so, I called Palm and a pleasant person Fedexed me a new one overnight, no charge.Oh how Palm has changed, I have learned! You have to deal with people in India who bareky speak English. They charge $40 to ship a *refurbished* replacemnet if you don't want to wait 2 weeks. Then they sent it to the wrong address, after I read very slowly my address 3 times to the guy in India. They never respond to email.My loyalty to Palm is gone. :>("
4,Palm One Tungsten E Handheld,"I use this daily for many purposes. I do not use the Bluetooth function, but it is included. not enough memory even with an extra card. Easy to use, and to teach yourself how to use it."
1,Do not buy this PDA!,I got a whole six months use out of this unit before the battery would no longer charge. This is apparently very common for these units. Check out some of the forums around relating in particular to the battery problems. I checked with Palmone and it will cost $120.00 to replace the battery plus shipping (they will only replace at Palm). What is the point in buying a $200.00 unit if you have to spend another $120 after six months? You are better off buying a Zire.
3,"Good handheld unit, but lousy installation software","I got this unit free during some promotion and I feel lucky I did not spend a penny on this model. Here are the reasons why:1. Lousy installation software. It is always stuck in the middle of installation (on Windows XP). Ctrl-Alt-Del to kill it. Same story for uninstallation. This is irritating. Wonder if Palm ever has software QA department since it is such a dumb problem.2. Small LCD screen. Maybe it is a tradeoff due to its relative cheap price.3. Should come with a MP3 player by default.4. Battery life is not impressive. In case it dies, the whole unit needs to be thrown away.But it does have some good points:1. Sharp LCD display at reasonable resolution2. Fast CPU for typical tasks3. Enough memory for my records."
2,Expense function,"Please be advised that in ""Add-in"" Expense module, the milage rate ($0.290 / mile) is a fixed number and can not be changed. There is no fix or work around for this and none is planned."
2,Problems,"My husband and I have owned our Tungsten E for about 2 years now. My Tungsten developed the whine after the first year. But other than that we have had no complaints. Now, after 2 years, both of our Tungstens no longer work. They will sync with the computer, but if we try to use the power on/off button there is no response. When I called customer service I was informed it would be a $25 dollar charge to speak with them unless it resulted in a repair order at $140.Needless to say we will be looking at other options for our next palm."
4,Missing some basics,"I upgraded from a mono Sony clie (which I loved) to the E recently. The color is phenomenal - but I had a few surprises about basics that I never considered before buying. I am an accountant - it has no calculator. It has no cradle - my desk is a scene of organized chaos - and without a cradle upon which to stand it ABOVE the piles, it gets hidden under them. And without a cradle, I constantly have to turn it on (when I can find it) to view it. Both of these issues are fixable, with more money, and more time (the cradle is not yet available.) Just annoying..."
1,fatal flaw,"I bought this fully aware that the batteries cannot be replaced by the owner - you have to mail it to Palm, who for a mere $125 will replace it. But I figured the battery would last a long time. Wrong. It lasted four months, then died. I'd say that is a fatal flaw.The competition lets you put in a new battery yourself, so I'd recommend looking into some other product that lets you do that."
1,Problematic Organizer...,"My tungsten e is not one with the whining noise. But it does crash a lot. I can't use it for long either, b/c the battery life is sooooo short. I used to have a psion revo. My psion revo was stable, and fast. I frequently have to reset my palm tungsten e. The alarm is not very loud at all for agenda appointments (forgettaboutit). I wish I had my psion revo back. Psion went out of the pda business, but they had a great product they just didn't market their product well in the united states. Palm on the other hand, markets their product very well, but as for reliability... It's terrible. I will never agian purchase another palm product."
2,Warranty ......What Warranty ?,"I bought my Tungsten E after it came out in Oct. of 2003 and I enjoyed it until August of 2004.The screen was fried. Squiggley lines throughout. I called PALM and I find out that the Tungsten E has only a 3 month warranty.What is that !!! I have owned 2 other PALMs and I had no idea of this 90 day warranty........SHOCKING !I will buy another PALM because I like the OS, but it will not be a Tungsten E. Why pay for a repair at $125.oo .PALM is losing my confidence and oh by the way the support in INDIA is horrible. They staff reads scripts off the screen, that is sad. What has happened to the quality Support Palm was known for."
2,chowdhary,"i acquired this palm tungsten e from my school for course related work. i used it barely a few days and and then, it doesnot work anymore. its great looks, good memory, good backlite features, but NO RELIABILITY. The hardware has gone packing. waranty is 3 months - woefully bad.palm one will need to do their hardware 'home-work' better - i wonder how such an un-relaiable product is sold in dozens (or is it so?).overall, palm one has poor hardware put out to users."
1,Customer Service Just Horrible,"My Palm never worked properly so I had to send it back (on their recommendation) to be refurbished. To make a long story short, they lost it, denied they lost it, and after about a dozen phone calls on my end they finally agreed to send me a new one. I'm still waiting. I could barely understand the service people and when I asked where they were they answered ""Bangladesh."" They never had a record of any of my previous calls so each time I called I had to tell my story from the begining. I will never buy another product from Palm and urge everyone to stay away from this product. It's not worth it in any way."
1,Avoid,"I've been using Palms for years, but I have had nothing buy problems with the Tungsten E. I have never been able to get this PDA to hotsync, except when software was first installed. I don't have time to reinstall the software everytime I want to sync.Basically, Palm was ahead of its time. Then time caught up and passed Palm by. Simplicity was Palm's virtue, but each additional feature has only caused Palm to lose reliability and usability."
2,Very Disappointed,"I just purchased this handheld PC two days ago and it froze up on me and it is still stuck on the page with the time and calender. I really liked it at first, because it had all of the features that I was looking for and the price was just right, but now I cannot turn it on or off or either use it for that matter. I am very disappointed and this is not a good product at all, especially since I bought it brand new at the store."
1,$125 to get a new battery???,"My Tungsten E was a pleasure to use, but now the battery won't charge. The Website for Palm says my only option is to send it in for a $125 repair charge. But it REALLY suggests that I just go ahead a buy a new palm... I'm STUNNED!!! It's just over a year old and needs a new battery!!! There's no way for me to get a battery unless I send it in and pay the $125 fee. What happened to the concept of buying something to last???"
2,Defective. Palm support worthless.,"Bought a Tungsten E for my wife to replace her aging Clie T615. When an alarm is supposed to sound and the PDA is turned off, you hear a clipped sound -only the last instant/or tone- of the alarm. It's as if the sound starts before the PDA turns itself on. So alarms become worthless. Went to the store, changed it for a new TE and it had the same problem. After repeated hard-resets, and describing the problem to Palm support, they suggested I do *another* hard reset (i.e. they don't have a clue). I've seen at least two other references to this problem on the net.Careful and watch for this."
2,Speak to me,"Nice unit. Problem though, the speaker packed up after a week. Try getting it replaced ... reset, hard reset, have you turned it on? Infuriating. Search Google and you'll see that this speaker often packs up, why don't they admit it and replace it without question?Would never buy anything from them again. Impossible to contact, web site just takes you round in circles."
3,Hearing things...,"First off, I love this thing just like everyone else. A word of caution, though - if you have good hearing and don't like high pitched whining noises, you may be in for a surprise. The backlight on this thing puts out a loud, high pitched noise that is audible from several feet away. It also makes a clicking sound, which is less audible. Also, when you press the stylus to the screen, the speaker/headphones put out electrical hum, which is not extremely loud, but is annoying if you're listening to music through headphones and trying to write something. I can't stand all the noise. Its annoying that I found the otherwise-perfect Palmpilot and I hate using it because the noise is so aggravating. I figured I had a defective unit but then my mom bought one and same deal."
1,Tungsten E- Battery Life is terrible,"I just wanted to put in my two cents about this unreliable product and the company who is ripping off customers. I bought mine from PalmOne.com and I am having the same problems that seem to be address by more than one person on this site. They do not back up their products at all. My product had problems the first week, and because I did not realize that I only had 30days warranty on an open box item, they would not fix the item without me paying another $75.00 which with a little arguing the drop to $50.00, but by that time I was in no mood to give them any more of my money. It is clear to me that this product has a defect that the company must address. I personally have lost trust in ordering any electronic devices on line, due the the bad experience I had with palmOne. I just want to add to the rest of the poor reviews by saying... do not buy this product."
5,Sync-Cable News,"To solve the problem of an extra sync-cable, go to any office supply store or electronic store and purchase an A plug/5-pin mini-B plug. I purchased mine at Best Buy in California. It will work very well to sync. After several calls to Palm, and numerous inquiries on the net, I finally discovered this simple solution with the help of a compassionate palm tech, who listened to my frustration of not being to easily obtain an extra sync-cable. Sure one comes with the ""E"", but I wanted one for my office use. I hope this helps some of you out there. The ""E"" is fantastic otherwise."
3,No universal connector,The Tungstein E is a big step up from my PALM m100. But it does not have a universal connector. If I knew that I would have bought the Zire with camera. This product is falls short without that connection.
2,Graffiti grumble,"I upgraded from m515 only to find that they changed the hand-scribe language called Graffiti for this model due to a lawsuit. The new Graffiti is inferior. If you are used to inputting data using Graffiti, you may be very disappointed like me with this model. It has a hard time understanding me.In addition, the larger processor was a disappointment. It still is not powerful enough to move quickly through the screens of HandyShopper, the best application ever written for Palm in the opinion of many, including me.I find myself reverting to my easier to use, more pleasing m515. Probably my next model will be WinCE."
4,Best Basic PDA,"Bought two of these (from Amazon) with the hard case, for my wife & myself. Earlier had 2 Psion 5mx but my wife never liked her Psion as they were too bulky & complex. She loves the palmPros:+ Right price+ Great OS & software bundle+ Great screenCons:- Battery Life & not replaceable- Crashes Sometime- Could do with a voice recorderRecomendation: if you buy this PDA, add in the hard case, as my Palm E is still alive and looks new thanks to the case."
1,Piece of Junk,"I read all of the reviews for the Palm Tungsten E and thought that my experience would be better. Well, it was not. The Palm worked magnificently for the first 2 or 3 days. Then a fatal error occurred and the machine could not be reset. There was nothing that I could do. All was lost. My new machine was dead, gone, no more. That was disheartening. The best part of the Palm is the software for scheduling. It is easy to use and really great. Unfortunately, the actual Palm is a piece of junk. I am going back to a pencil and paper for the scheduler. Also, the MP3 player in the palm is really substandard. Buy a real MP3 if that is what you want or if you really care what your music sounds like.The Tungsten E is jack of all and master of none when it actually works. When it does not, and most likely yours will fail too, you will want to toss it against the wall. Hopefully it fails before the anemic warranty runs out.Save yourself, DO NOT BUY THE PALM TUNGSTEN E."
1,The warranty is worthless,"On first appearance the Tungsten E is great value for money. As time progresses the flaws emerge...If anything fails after the first three months one might as well throw it away - the warranty is worthless ($129 or more to repair a $155 machine). The power button may fail - mine failed ten days outside the warranty.The battery has a very limited lifespan, and it cannot be replaced when it fails.Caveat emptor"
1,Absolute garbage...,"Not to repeat thousands of others experience, but straight out of the box my Tungsten E won't hold a charge more or less at all. Charge it full, let it sit on the desk turned OFF for four days and it's lost everything. Genuine piece of garbage. As others have said customer service is non-existant.NEVER BY A PRODUCT FROM PALM. PERIOD.Follow that advice and you can't go wrong."
1,Don't buy unless you're rich & have lots of spare time,"The product itself would be great if it were reliable. After a few months (after the stingy warranty expired), my battery died. This was a big surprise, since my PDA was plugged into the charger about 90% of the time. The replacement battery is only available at Palm and costs about $125 plus about $40 more for shipping, etc. Add in your time to fuss around with this. What a rip off! I chose a Tungsten E, because I am retired and didn't have the money for a more fancy brand. I cannot afford a new battery. To discuss this matter with Palm, one must pay $25 just for the phone call. No thanks. I have signed up for a class action lawsuit and am planning to contact my Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau. I hope you do too if you already own one. Once the battery is replaced, it will most likely die again in a short period of time, since the product is clearly defective."
3,Fantastic but for Battery,"This would be a fantastic product for the price in terms of features, if it weren't for the battery. (I included an extended warrenty as part of my consideration to buy.) In the first 2 days, I ran the battery down 4 times and of course recharged. The screen is bright and easily read but that is probably part of the battery problem. Turn down the brightness right away and it is still bright. I love the music capability, but again it uses up the battery fast. Also hot syncs seem slow as compared to my old Palm 505.Obviously Palm wants to build in forced replacement or they would come up with replaceable batteries. Don't buy this without an extended warranty. You can get 1 year from PalmOne and longer from some stores."
5,can NOT add bluetooth!,"I just wanted to clarify the posting from ""uojfe from Eugene, OR USA"". Althought bluetooth expansion cards exist, the Tungsten E can not use them."
2,Dissapointing,"I bought the Palm Tungsten E for my 14 year old son last christmas...Everything was working just great until June ...so it only lasted 6 months!He took good care of it but suddenly it locked up and there is no way we can start it again even to reset it!So , what's the deal? only for 6 months!!!!And buying that online makes it even dissapointing because I can't get a possitive answer from them. I never have had any problem with the site, but with electronics , that is not a good idea to buy them from internet."
2,Good idea - lousy battery life,"Bought one of these for my partner last year. Works fine for her, but the battery barely lasts through a day's use. If she forgets to plug it in overnight, it's useless the next day (no power left). All other Palm devices I've owned (and that's been quite a few!) have a considerably longer battery life. I'm looking to buy her a holiday replacement to her E right now...so if you're thinking of getting a Palm device, I recommend steering clear of the E.Giving it 2 stars because I like the Palm...but if I was rating on battery I'd give it 0 stars."
1,Terrible Service,"As you scan these reviews, count the number that applaud Palm service and responsiveness to problems. Then count the number of reviews that mention Palm service. No contest.When calling to replace my E's battery, I was told - get this - that once I allowed them to charge my credit card $161US, THEN they would tell me where to send it for battery replacement. I had to ask twice just to make sure I was hearing correctly. My business partner had the identical problem, bought a replacement battery on the internet for $40 and soldered it in place himself."
1,Two models dead and counting,"I was very dissapointed to read the rest of the reviews, as I thought that maybe I had just had a bad run. The Palm was bought for me as a Christmas gift 2003 (with an extended warranty). After 2 days, before I even got a chance to successfully upload the software onto the Palm, it froze and squealed. I had to wait for the battery to drain to turn it off.The retailer was very good and got me a brand new one pretty much straight away. All was good for a while, then the battery started to drain quickly. Now it won't turn on at all. This happened a couple of months ago BTW. After reading the rest of these reviews, I don't even think I'll even bother. April 2004"
2,Frustrating!,"The screen and size are wonderful, but what is not so wonderful is that it does not come with a cradle that allows you to synch up and power up with the same unit - you have to use a separate power connector and a USB cable for each function. Also, not having the Palm Universal Connector is a MAJOR drawback - you can't use most of the Palm keyboards (or many other Palm accessories) to connect to it and that is a major drawback for my uses! I also have had MAJOR problems in synching up at work and the support people at Palm would not give me any advice about it (probably because it's so new they didn't have any advice to give me). I'm returning it to the store this weekend and plan to buy a Sony unit instead!"
2,"be careful, it might not fit your door","I loved the concept and was trying to have a chin bar for my daughter without drilling into the house. But my older house has thicker door jams, and this didn't work for me. There should be some door specs that would have made it easier for me to know in advance that this wouldn't fit. For newer homes, it is probably a great idea."
1,Wish I could have used it!,"This item was very easy to assemble and looked like it would be easy and comfortable to use-- but it wouldn't fit the depth of my door. There are no depth specifications on the box or inside in the directions that say that this item will NOT FIT a door more than 6"" deep. It just says it will fit most residential house doors. Luckily, it was not hard to assemble, or de-assemble, and I will just return it. But please, put all specifications in the item information!"
5,Just Perfect!,"I seriously love this product, best pull u bar I have ever used. I'm 205 pounds and this thing works fine for me. Hasn't hurt my door frame at all.Seriously gym quality, buy it!"
4,Is what it is!!,Works well in my doorway...Easy to assemble...Could use some additional grip padding...Happy with this purchase as it feels very solid when doing all exercises and perfect for hanging clothes after ironing.
4,Perfect for P90X!,"First time I put this up, I am not going to lie that I was very nervous hanging from it. But this thing works excellent! I use it for my P90X workouts and it works perfect. No limitations.Definitely consider being this over the one that P90X offers and you will save a ton of money."
5,Very stable pull up bar,"I'm amazed by how stable the whole bar is once its up. There is no movement at all when doing pull ups, but the bar is still really easy to put up and take down.I bought the gym with the wide reach bar and door extensions, and the whole package works great. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Product,"Fairly easy to assemble. The wrench tool leaves much to be desired, but it worked. Once together, I've had no problems at all. Works great. No marks left on door-frame."
5,The best gadget I have purchased ever...,"The door gym is a simple and yet effective solution to regular , door style bars.I assembled just after I got it and started on some gravity work.One thing the manufacturer should also tell you is that you can actually disassemble and take it with you on a trip.I you have done sufficient business travel you are probably avoiding the so called gyms.Lastly, I would also suggest you get the push up handles ( get them at WalMart for 8.99). Go for it!!"
1,be careful...,"I fell off and almost broke my back. Only will fit certain size door frames. I sent it back and seller was nice enough to give a refund. My recommendation is the [[ASIN:B004FLECVS Perfect Multi-Gym Pullup] instead. For the same price you get a pullup bar that seems to be much more sturdy, well made and will fit just about any wall size you have."
4,Great product!,"Product works great! Very secure on door frame. Although, it has left small indents on my door frame. The soft part does not extend far enough to fit accross my door frame. Otherwise, great product!"
4,Good Item,"I am using the door gym daily since I got it. It is very convenient. Just make sure you measure the door well. If the size is not correct it might bruise the door a bit. What I didn't like about it is that the wide grip and door extensions are overpriced. I didn't buy them because of that. All in all it is a good tool. For the installation, make sure you follow the enclosed leaflet."
4,Well pleased with the product,I admit I bought this partly because I was curious to see how it worked. I found it to be stable when used and I had no concerns about it falling off the door.
4,great product....bad directions/accesories a little pricey,"This thing is frick'n awesome. I am one step closer to proving that you don't need to go to the gym to stay in shape(or at least that I don't need to). Puts up easy. Comes down easy. Sturdy, relatively well designed, and efficient. Sadly the directions are virtually nonexistent. If not for my superhero-like intuitive mechanical abilities I might have had some trouble putting this wonderful device together. I would pay to see a video of the reviewer who said the thing came crashing down on his head, a youtube hit for sure. Hooray for door gym for hastening the natural selection of the mechanically challenged(kidding...sort of). Can't wait for my wide grip attachments(which should be included or at least not cost so much). So to summarize: Door Gym is the s%!t. Assembly instructions are s%!$$y. Wide grip extensions should be included or cheaper."
4,Very Good--Just be care careful pads are positioned on door frame,"In use for a month. Easy assembly. Astonishingly easy to put up or take down.Be sure to position pads on your door frame, or metal will press against the door frame and dent/chip the frame."
2,"nice product, but....",- the thread on the screw lose. i couldn't tighten and hang it at my door properly.- pretty bad quality.
5,great buy,I am very pleased with this product. It was easy to install and has been very secure. No damage to our door frame. My husband and I have been using it for over a month and we have both been very pleased.
4,Read why I didnt give it 5 stars,"I was skeptical before purchasing it and figured I dont have much to lose if the product does turn out to be bad. I made my decision after reading other's reviews. I must tell you how happy I am with this product. It is light weight, sturdy and easy to mount and unmount (literally in 2 secs). It is an excellent excellent pull up bar. It does everything a gym pull up bar does while you are in the comfort of your home. I like how you can use it with 4 different grips.I wanted to give it 5 stars but did not becuase the box had wrong size nuts and bolts. I had to spend extra $3 (plus gas and time) and purchase the right size from local hardware store."
4,Just What I Wanted,The door gym is worth the money. Assembly was straightforward and very easy. A small clip is included and when inserted at the top of the door frame it serves as a guide to ensure the door gym is properly fitted on the door frame. Mounting/dismounting the door gym to/from the door frame takes only a second. The door gym itself has sufficient foam padding to prevent marring or marks on the door frame. Foam padding is provided for hand grips but the positioning of the foam has one's wrists a little too close together. My suggestion would be to provide foam padding all across the horizontal bar.
1,Unstable and not fit for all doors,"I have been bodybuilding and doing powerlifting for years. Trust me when I say this product is not stable and for its price, you are better investing another $20 or $40 to get a P90x chin up bar. You can't even do a wide grip pull up bar with it. For general fitness I would say this product is ok but for those who have specific goals, this is not something you want to spend $40++ on."
1,Not the Product Described,I was shipped something that was not the product as described. It was just a few flimsy pieces of metal bars that are easily bent.
4,works well,"solid enough construction. even after two yrs of constant use, the bar has no flex, locks solidly in place and does its job"
4,Great addition to home workouts!,"I weigh around 190-195lb and was very hesitant about buying this home pullup bar. None the less, I decided to give it a try in order to add another option for back/biceps workouts at home. This thing performed awesomely! It was very easy to assemble, and extremely sturdy. It supported my weight with no issues. I put a small wash cloth on each end of the bar to prevent it from damaging (leave black marks and indentions) on the door frame, and it works great!"
1,"Someone else said it best, this product is a scam","The odds of this product fitting your molding and jamb size are slim, yet they don't tell you this before you buy it. Once you get the product and waste your time assembling it (btw, the screws are too short and the instructions are worthless), you realize that the width of the door jamb and the molding has to be almost exact or else the product does not work and is dangerous. THEN, you are faced with putting this odd shaped thing back in the box which is difficult and paying the $20 to ship it back! Or, if you are like me and probably many others, you just say forget it and throw it out."
2,Might work but not for me,"Assembled easy for me, but does not fit all doors. Doors in my house have a lip over them, and doors at my school it just did not fit. So if you find a door it fits its great, if not your screwed."
1,Low Quality,This worked for a few weeks then broke and damaged my door and injured my shoulder. Not recommended.
1,Shipping Weight: 5.6 pounds,The weight of this product is so low. What metal at such low density could be stable. Not sure what the weight limit is.
5,Great product!,The Creative Fitness Door Gym chinup bar works really well! Very easy to install and very fast and easy to remove! We highly recommend it!
3,I'm crossing my fingers I don't fall down,"Average product, but reasonable for the price. The instructions were worse than the ones from Ikea. On installing you have to puncture the plastic, which should be done by the manufacturer.It is simple to install on the door frame, but it seems to pull on the moulding. Maybe its just the shoddy construction of where I live, but on the first few uses of the bar I felt like I might break the doorway.After a month it has continued to hold my and my boyfriend's weight, but I think we may have to reinforce our door frame."
1,Won't fit your Crown Molding!!!,"It took some time to figure out which screws to put where but I got it. But still the directions should be better. After assembling, I couldn't get this thing to fit my door. I have crown molding around it. And even though they show that on the brochure...it doesn't fit. It's all based on some device that you can shove into the seal of your door. Well it's sealed! Even if I could've gotten it in...it still doesn't lay against the door. I was really looking forward to this but within minutes of receiving this and assembling it I was disassembling it, sending it back for a refund, and writing this review."
2,missing parts,"Did anyone else receive this item without instructions or bolts? I just spent 30 min on the phone with amazon to fix this issue, and they are going to have me return the item and will ship me another one. I am annoyed as it took me over a week to get the item, now I will have to wait at least 2 more weeks just because there were no bolts with it. The box is undamaged and doesn't look as if it had been opened before."
4,Great product/poor set-up instruction manual.,"I really like the Creative Fitness Door Gym. It is great to have a pull-up bar handy so you really do have NO excuses not to get a few pull-ups in.My only complaint is the utter lack of proper set-up instruction. I am pretty anal about set-up (especially when a product will fall, with me hanging onto it, if not set up correctly) and there are different nuts/bolts etc, but the manual does not clearly illustrate what goes with what. It is slightly a pain in the butt trial and error factor but once you do get it set up, it works great."
5,Works great except for.....,".....the fact that it's very picky with the type of door frame. I tried every one in my house and thankfully found 2 that it would fit. Other than that, it's exactly as advertised. Can set up in a second. All I need now is the extension bar."
5,It's a pullup bar,"This is a pull-up bar. If you want to do pull-ups it is the best solution for your home. Put up and take down in seconds with no tools. Comfy foam padding, sturdy design. Some assembly required.As a bonus you can also use the thing as a push-up bar. You may ask why you'd need a push-up bar when you have a floor. Well, you don't. It's just a bonus."
2,"""Residential"" doors are not all alike","The Door Gym and other items like it need to have way more specific descriptions of their requirements. This product would probably work great if you had the right kind of molding. The molding in my house is too tall and too thick for this product to work. Also, the walls themselves and therefore the door frame is too thick for this to fit.The only requirement they tell you about is the width of the door. I have many doors fitting the width requirement, but none fitting the molding requirements. Lots of houses in New England have molding just like mine. In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of anyone I know whose doors this would fit. I think you need to have doors that have only the simplest modern-looking cheap molding in order for the Door Gym to fit."
4,works like a charm,was very skeptical about the claims of this product. it says that it installs on the door frame in seconds without damage... and it actually delivers! have only had for a few days but so far it works as promised. can hold my weight and seems pretty secure. i'm only a little concerned with the strength of the door frame but only time and repeated use will tell. easy to put together although the directions were VERY minimal in the sheet provided (had to guess which washers went where). also the other claims of being used for push ups or crunches is a bit of a stretch... pull ups are great though
4,Works in a pinch..,Overall for the price this is a good product. Most importantly make sure you have a door jam which this will work in. Take some measurements and examine the area which you will exercise in. It should easily fit most homes and allow you to incorporate another exercise into your routine.
1,Very dissapointed.,"Battery will not charge at all. This can't be a New Battery as the ad says. Now, I have to send it to back to Brilliant Store.Battery Gateway M350WVN Replaces 6500776 SQU-211, I am waiting for a return merchandise authorization(RMA#). What a hassle.JP-FLORIDA"
5,The Best Play brought to the Screen,"It was a great movie and the soundtrack is just that, great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you loved the movie and bought the DVD, then the music can go with you any time in the car, or even on your computer to just listen to the beautiful music, timeless, A Hundred Million Miracles is just one of those and you know, if you've seen the movie how many songs are like a miracle. Cudos to the writers and singers."
5,Beautiful music!,I purchased both the soundtrack from the play and also from the movie. I have seen the movie several times and still enjoy it. The soundtrack is beautiful. I highly recommend it. I only wish they would have continued with the story; a great picture and a great soundtrack.
3,Disappointed,I have listen to The Broadway 1958 Flower Drum soundtrack since I was a little girl. I loved it so much I had my dance teacher arrange a solo dance to the overature for me. A month ago I ordered the 1961 Film version expecting it to be equally beautifull. I couldn't believe my ears!!! It lacked so much depth that was contained in the 1958 version. Comparing the 2 Overatures the 1961 version seemed to skip right through it and it lacked the intence feelings the original 1958 version abtained.
5,the first and the best,"This album was my first expieriance with Italian rock. I first heard it 6 years ago and instantly became a fan of Litfiba. Anyone wishing to broaden thier horizons ought to buy this album--its thier earliest and I think thier best. Go right to the Istanbul track, then go back and listen to the whole thing! Anyone with a knowledge of the rift between the north and south of Italy is going to get this ablum."
1,The Heart of a Woman,"I should have known better than to read a book with this name whoever the author might be. It exemplifies all that I dislike most, wordiness, sentimentality, banality. Perhaps it got better as it went on but I did not have the patience to persist. It serves me right for not researching it better before buying. My only comfort is that it was free!"
5,Great EP from AC,"This EP is a little taste of what's to come from Animal Collective in 2007. ""People"" and ""Tikwid"" were some of my favorite jams from the tour in support of ""Sung Tongs"" that didn't appear on ""Feels"" the studio versions sound great and make me look forward to the follow up to ""Feels"" which is expected to hit shelves in the fall of '07. The live version of ""People"" has me eagerly anticipating the live box set that's due out this spring."
4,Awesome EP,"Great music. Opens with a superb title track and is followed by Tikwid (or, the reason I bought the EP). Also, included is a very nice and faithful live rendition of ""People"" from a show that they had performed. If you were a fan of the newer Animal Collective records that would be reason enough to incorporate this EP into the fold and see how their sound has evolved. Brilliant."
4,kindle,"I was pleased with the many things I could do on the kindle, but shortly after received,a week and a half, to be exact, the battery went out. I placed an order for two new ones back in Dec.that I haven't gotten yet. I hope the warrenty doesn't expire before I rec'them, so will know if that is the problem? I have several books on it, I want to read..and so am quite anxious to get the batteries."
3,SOMEONE MAKE A CHANGE???,"I want a hand grip on the sides of this thing TODAY!!!! whoever designed this thing totally overlooked the biggest and most important aspect of a ""book"" , the ability to HOLD it comfortably. CRIPES, there is NO WHERE to hold it! How could they have missed that one? I tried my friend's Kindle, and was totally turned off by 3 things,1)ALL white case, blah??? Could they at least invent ""book covers""???2)NO WHERE TO HOLD THE KINDLE, buttons everywhere, and its like holding a slim picture frame, HUH?????3)I'll wait a couple years for that[...] price tag to come down......and the bugs to work out, and for some invention of a handle.Not going to spend [...] a roos on a gizzmo I can't even hold."
4,No O/S access,"Having read numerous reviews, studied the data, and now lusting after a Kindle, v1 notwithstanding, I can't have one. Why? Because I live in sunny Sydney, Australia, don't have a US mail address nor a credit card from a US bank.When is it likely to change? I regularly use one-click to purchase music and books from Amazon, so what is different with this device?"
3,"Good product, weak selection","My problem with the kindle is thus: it's simply hard to find the books you want, unless you gobble up every bestseller in print. So far, this device seems to cater to the mainstream as far as novels and literature."
5,I love my Kindle,"I got my Kindle for Christmas as a gift andI love it. I keep it loaded. Some Chekhov, a summer read, a classic, and tons more. It goes where no book has gone before. And it goes everywhere with me. It is lightweight. It holds a lot of reading. It works on trains, ships, planes- wherever bulky books would go."
5,Kindle,"I love the Kindle. At firts I was like everyone else when I saw the pics, awful. But in person, I have a totally different opinion. It actually looks good. I have been waiting for an EBOOK Reader for some time now. There are already a few out there, but none of them with a library big enough for me to invest in the readers. Amazon changed that. With 90,000+ titles and the potential of millions, I could not wait to get the Kindle. And now that I have it, I don't regret it. The satisfaction of searching, buying and reading a book within a minute from the comfort of my bed is priceless. Keep in mind that I wanted an EBOOK Reader; not a magazine reader, blog reader, newspaper reader, web browser, mp3 player, dictionary or an encyclopedia (Wikipedia). The fact that Kindle gives you these are just extras. You either use them or you don't, period."
5,I love my Kindle,I got the kindle for christmas and I love it. It is really cool. I think it is better than buying books at a bookstore its cheaper. You can read books in the sunlight and it dont even hurt your eyes. I already have 5 books on it and I plan on adding more. It takes less than a minute to download a book on to it. This is the best thing I have ever owned. You can also make the print bigger.
5,I LOVE MY KINDLE!,"I just received a Kindle for Christmas and I love it. It's so easy to read...I never imagined I'd prefer it to a traditional book, but I do! It also downloads quickly, has good battery power, and is very user-friendly. I highly recommend it...wouldn't want to do without it now! I think the Kindle is to books what iPods were to music."
5,MY KINDLE,I love my Kindle! I can adjust the font to a comfortable size. I can navagate through my Kindle with ease.I would love to have the ability to write and use it as my total organizer as well! Soon????
2,Not like reading a real book,"I purchased this Kindle on a whim, a $300 whim. If you want to turn the Kindle ""ON or OFF"", you have to take the ""book"" out of it's leather cover to turn it on, then put it back in the leather cover. You have to ""hold"" the Kindle a certain way as not to turn the pages of the book. I really wish I would have put more thought into this purchase, before I shelled out a precious $300. One note: It was mentioned that down loading the Kindle was far cheaper than buying the book itself; not true. When I was shopping, I found ""The Shack"" (book) cheaper than the download. Buyer beware."
4,room for improvement,Concept is greatApplication needs improvement:1. On-off switch should be on front of unit.2. Page turning is too easy. Maby set back from edge so that unintended operation is more difficult.3. Of almost no concern is the time taken to turn pages.
4,Good bang for the buck but 2-day free shipping seems like false advertisement,I've provided my impression with 4-star rating while waiting to receive my unit. My review was not posted and my order was shipped on Nov. 21 but the scheduled delivery date is Nov. 27! That is not a 2-day delivery promised by Amazon!
1,Very disappointed...,"Turned on Kindle, after several days of use. Screen on product is now covered with concentric squares, over more than 90% of screen! Tried resetting, changing battery, downloading software update from Amazon site. Nothing Helps."
3,It all depends on the price.,"I bought this refurbished Kindle 1 for about $55. I have a Kindle 3 and several Kindle 4's. The Kindle 4's are being prepared to be loaned as part of a ministry my church is initiating, and I purchased the Kindle 1 to see if such refurbished, older units might be used in this ministry instead of the 4s to lower the costs. I decided it doesn't represent a viable option. The Kindle 4 screen is the same size, but the unit is thinner and lighter. The Kindle 4 looks sturdier, is more responsive, holds more content, and is a little easier to use. The refurbished Kindle 1 came in good condition and does everything it was designed to do, but at $55 when a newer, better model can be had for $80, It isn't a good deal. At $25 or so it might represent a good buy for someone as their first eReader on a tight budget."
5,fabulous,"I am an avid book reader and the Kindle is a book lovers dream!!It is so easy to use-so easy and fast to shop in the Kindle store and get books, magazines and newspapers- I am never without something to read-Thank you Amazon!!!"
5,Instant gratification,"As soon as I hear of an interesting new book I can, usually, get it instantly with the kindle. Well OK almost instantly. Ever finish a book in a series in the middle of the night that leaves you hanging? Get the next book right away!The latest Steven King opus is usually only a little cheaper as a kindle edition but think of the weight savings.After only an hour or so I forgot that I was using an electronic device instead of a paper book."
5,Terrific product!,"I love to read and my husband thought this would be a great present for me and he was right! It took me a little while to get up to speed with it, but I really like the convenience of it. The pages don't get bent and I have many books to access and only one to carry. Your customer service is excellent with it also. Thanks for the great product."
4,I use it all the time,"My Kindle has become my constant companion. Whenever there is down time or waiting time, I have it out reading one of several books I have going or reading the NIV Bible cover to cover. It's easy to bookmark where I am in each book. Highlighting is nice, but I would like more control of where the highlight starts and ends (You can't begin or end a highlight in the middle of a line...the whole line has to be included). Since the G3 network became available in my area the Kindle Store is very available and convenient. I like being able to sample books before I buy them. It's fun! I like it."
4,Love at first sight,"I absolutely love my Kindle. I live in a small apartment with minimal storage space, and I am an reading is a passion of mine. I have no space for book storage, and I have difficulty both holding a weighty book, and in reading many of the various type faces in books. Kindle takes care of all of these problems for me.It is light weight; I can sample books before purchase; I can ajust the type size to suit my eyes; it can easily travel with me; I find that when out of its case the rubberized back on it allows me to rest it on the arm of my chair, and I don't even have to hold it.The Kindle is avery important part of my entertainment budget, and I consider every cent well spent."
5,I don't know a lot but...,"I don't know a lot, but I do know this is one great product. I have had Kindle for a few days now and it performs well and customer support is without equal for any electronic device I have ever owned. Some very minor problems were corrected immediately by calling amazon Kindle support and I could not be happier with the service or the product. So, kudos to amazon for this great product. The price for Kindle is small when compared to the benefits.-loikew"
4,Changed the way I casually read,"After receiving my Kindle I was pleasantly surprised by just how easy it was to retrieve the books I had preordered. I was a bit anxious about learning yet another new piece of electronic equipment. Well my anxiety was quickly put to rest after I was able to cruise through the Kindle without reading the directions.Since I have had the Kindle it has been my default reading during the week when I am at work in the downtime, as well as the times I take to have lunch.I did have an issue with the screen after a month or so, but was quickly replaced with limited trouble."
5,Love My Kindle,I'v had my Kindle for over a month now and have read at least 10 books. I can't even begin to say how much I've enjoyed it. Previous to the Kindle I did most of my reading on my Palm TX and although this worked great the kindle beats it hands down. I love being able to download wirelessly and having a book to read within minutes. Price wasn't a factor for me. I started saving shortly after Christmas and it didn't take long. The book prices are about what I would pay for a paperback and I can get the NYT bestellers almost as soon as they come out for that price. So if your on the fence about the Kindle rest assure that if you live in an area that has Sprint coverage you'll love the Kindle
3,Great concept needs improvement,"I've read 2 books on the Kindle. Generally, it's great. However, I have some suggestions for future development:1. There is no reason for the ""Previous Page"" & ""Next Page"" tabs to run the nearly the full-length of the Kindle. In holding or maneuvering the Kindle, I often accidently touch these tabs causing problems.2. Why is the on-off switch located on the back of the Kindle? It's awkward to get to when it is in the book cover.3. A touch-screen would be nice.4. The scroll wheel is somewhat archaic."
3,CONNECTIVITY ISN'T WHAT I EXPECTED,"The Kindle itself is amazing, alone I would give it 5 stars, however, I can't get a connection in the city I live in. It isn't safe to say if you can get a cell phone connection you can get a Kindle connection. It is disappointing, as I have to travel to get a connection and buy books, so that means I need to plan ahead.I tried calling customer support, but was on hold for a long, long time. I would like to have an answer as to why I can't get a connection in Augusta, ME, when our cell phone has full connection.Before purchasing you may want to check with support to find out if they can answer this connectivity issue."
1,Make Very Certain You Have Sprint Connectability In Your Area,I have had my Kindle just two days. I am very upset because it is pretty much useless to me because I have no signal to download wirelessly. I guess I should have checked a little further into it before I shelled out the high price of $350.00. From what I can see if you don't get good Sprint cell coverage in your area this system is useless to you. I have an AT&T and an AllTell cell tower within sight of my house but cannot get even one bar of connectibility. You can go online and minipulate the system for downloads but that kind of takes away from the whole purpose of wireless download.
1,Duped by Amazon Kindle,"I could not wait to get my Kindle. I researched the site checked it out thouroughly. What it doesn't say anywhere is if you are an international customer, the WIRELESS feature will not work! It only works in the States. What it does not say, is that they will use your credit card to accept payment of the $399.00 Kindle but unless you have a United States billing address you will not be able to buy a $3.99 book for the Kindle.(I still cannot find the 'geographical restrictions' in the terms of use) What it does not say or hint at would be all the extra expenses you will incur like return shipping and payment for the telephone calls to their support site etc. This is an INTERNATIONAL lemon and somewhere on their site Amazon should post a WARNING!!!!!!"
1,great idea but......,great idea but it's just too expensive and no pdf support. Instead you have to convert the files to pdf. Wifi capability would be great in addition to the sprint service.
3,I sent mine back,"I was unable to get used to reading using the Kindle. I kept accidentally pushing the page forward buttonand had trouble finding my way back to references that I wanted to read again earlier in the book. In general,the final straw for me was the discomfort of actually holding the Kindle. I really disliked the feeling of holdingit and kept finding myself not wanting to read the books on it. I am grateful that Amazon allowed me to returnthe Kindle and refunded my money on the books that I had purchased, two of which I had also purchased inhard copy. I am SO happy to be back reading ""old-fashioned"" books."
4,great concept - but poor ergonomics,I love most of the software involved with this product. I do not like the sharp corners on the bottom of the kindle. When holding the device the corners dig into my palms. The next page and previous page buttons are too large and too close to the top of the device.
2,Fun and Convenient BUT. . . .,"The battery life is horrible. I've had my Kindle for 3.5 months, and the battery is already dead (yes, I tried recharging it). Unfortunately, replacement batteries are currently out of stock. Cell phones and ipods last longer than this, and they're cheaper! By the time I keep buying replacement batteries, I might as well have bought the hardcopy. If you are still thinking about purchasing a Kindle, at least add a spare battery to your cart so you have a back up when your Kindle inevitably dies."
3,"The Kindle, How long to be used.....","I was so excited when I purchased the Kindle. It was pricey, although I go the Oprah discount, but I thought it would be something My husband and I would use for years to come. He is a big reader, and enjoyed the first few books I ordered for him. (Twelve might orphans, and a few others)then, as he would finish one book I would look at ordering another and then consider the investment! He told a friend of his about the kindle and the ""orphans..."" story and wanted to share it with him. I explained that it was too expensive and not practical to share with someone, then we couldn't use it. Also, the books are really too expensive. It is much cheaper just to go to a half price book store and buy a book, borrow one from the library, or just borrow one from a friend.I think it can be good, but amazon needs to lower the price of books, esp. in this economy."
1,nothing but trouble,"I got a Kindle in Oct and mine worked great, all of a sudden it stopped workingSo I was sent a replacement, that didn't work at all, no functions at allSo I was sent another replacement, that one didn't work either.I have yet to get any tech support and I have dealth with a rude supervisor, Ray, and a rude customer service, Mariah.others have tried to help but at this point I am tired of wasting my timerun away from kindle"
3,pricing,"This review will be short and specific. While i can justify the kindles high cost, it is new technology after all, and with time that will drop. But how can u explain $9.99 for a book? Not only am i saving a tree by downloading the book electronically, but it would seem im also saving a lot of paper, and workload by the publisher not having to put the book on paper. A book i can purchase in paperback for 8 bucks should cost me no more then 5 bucks to buy for the kindle. Thats also another way to conserve the environment, less need for all those dollar bills to be made."
3,Disappointed,"Bought the Kindle for my sister who lives in Toronto, Canada. Did not know that the Kindle could not be used outside the United States. Considering that Oprah dedicated a large portion of her program promoting the Kindle....never once was it mentioned could not be used outside the USA. How unbelievable that in this day and age of electronics, the Kindle cannot be universal......very disappointed."
1,Poor,"In area no wireless,was told can download onto PC anywhere in the world then to kindle so far has not worked.Have sent e-mails to Amazon no help."
2,Not enough books available,"I got a Kindle for my birthday at my request. I thought I could use it to replace the books I have to take with me on the road when I am working on a story -- both books I might read for pleasure and for background -- but I find the selection is inferior to your average bookstore. For instance, I am reading a Denise Mina mystery trilogy. I'm on the seocnd volume, and wanted to read the third on my Kindle, but it's not available. I wanted to read something by the late David Foster Wallace, but the selection is very skimpy. I won't even get into books I wanted to look at for research. If I could return this product, I would do so in a flash."
3,kindle review,"Display page is too smal! It should be the size of an average size book! Buttons are too small and hard to see! They should be larger and easier to select by dark, large defining symbols against appropriate background. And finally why are most if not all available books priced at $9.99 (I have not yet surveyed prices for periodicals and newspapers). The seductive advertising suggested most titles were significantly less?? Please send me lists of books and periodicals at bargain pricesw!!"
3,Check for Sprint Coverage,"One thing that is not obvious from the promotions of Kindle is that the wireless works only on the Sprint cellphone network. It was definitely a disappointment to have my kindle arrive only to not be able to connect to a network. In fact there is no Sprint coverage within 300 miles of my home. While I can still download Kindle books, magazines, etc. with my computer, the utility of the device is certainly far less than advertised.Amazon would do well to warn users, especially those who live in rural areas."
4,Kindle - good and bad,"My husband gave me a Kindle for Christmas, and then, I bought one for my grand daughter. You have to remember to keep it juiced up and take your power cord when you travel (another cord to keep track of). I like to give books away after I read them, so I can't do that. It's very easy to read as you can enlarge the size of the type. You can't use it on a plane on takeoff and landing, so you need to take something else to read, too. It's amazing that you can download a whole book into it so fast. So - I like it very much, but I still LOVE a new hard covered book!"
4,Kindle is a terrific product,"I read a lot on the go, and sometimes several things concurrently including technical stuff, novels and humor. With Kindle, I have them all in a small, lightweight package that is easy to read and easy on the eyes. It's cheaper than a notebook, easier to read than a PDA and you can use the kindle to purchase and download books in a flash. I figure over the life of the device, I will more than make up the cost in paperback and hardback books, but it may be too pricey for a lot of people. I think that the 1 year no extention warranty is lightweight, given the cost. The one real complaint I have is that you can't grab it by the edges on the side without activating a button changing pages. It's mildly annoying. I haven't explored the licensing, but it would be nice if multiple kindles could share a book (i.e. within a family, etc.) Overall, I love it."
1,Kindle is unreliable and customer service is horrible.,I am now on my third kindle since January. The first one had a defective wireless option and could not download any books. The replaced it. My second kindle froze. They replaced it. My third kindle now refuses to turn on. I would like my money back. I have just been told that even though I have had all these problems Amazon will not refund my money. I can get a new kindle AGAIN and that is it. I will be looking for another wireless book with better performance and reliability. Perhaps the Kindle 2 is better product but I have to sell my Kindle myself and than purchase a Kindle 2 to find out. What a pain. I will buy the Sony
4,"Very Nice, A Few Quirks","I like the Kindle very much. Some of the things that could be improved are as follows:1. Bigger screen - Kindle is nice for reading novels and items such as the bible, however, the screen is a bit small and for this price, it could be much bigger. I read a lot of technical manuals with diagrams and the screen is too small to do it justice.2. Direct sunlight on screen causes letters to wash out. I think the screen is light sensitive, when reading in super bright light such as sunlight; I have to close the cover when changing pages to keep the letters from washing out.2. When buying a book with an accompanying CD, the CD is usually not available. This is a pet peeve and has made me buy the book anyway, just to receive the companion CD."
2,Kindle needs some design improvements,"I bought the Kindle on behalf of my 83-year old Mom, because she has macular degeneration and we were looking for something that would be easier for her to read. However, the largest font size could be one more jump up, and choosing silver as the color on the little slider that shows you what menu item you are choosing was nuts, in my opinion: WAY too hard to see, even for a person with normal vision--even black would be better, but why not RED? I do have to say that the wireless downloading feature is pretty amazing, though...but a completely inadequate array of magazines available, at least for now. We were hoping for The New Yorker."
5,Kindle Krazy,"Since purchasing the kindle as a gift for my husband, I can truthfully say that he has thoroughly enjoyed reading the books he has downloaded from the amazon site. He says that reading a book on the kindle is exceptionally easier than reading books in hardback or paperback form.... you can never lose your place with a kindle. I wouldn't know because after 6 weeks I still haven't been able to get my hands on it."
4,smokin' kindle,"Though the Kindle will not be in the running for an IDEA or IF award, what it does design well is a thoughtful reading experience. And once you are submerged in a digital book, how cool it looks recedes to the insignificant. It is both a practical device and an inspired one, particularly with its wireless potential and integrated ordering service and extras. I'm reading more because of it and (alas) buying more: it's too easy (and less costly for e-editions). Amazon really nailed the concept. It should become the bibliophile's version of the iPod."
4,Love my kindle,"I only wish it was back lit for nigttime reading and when the lighting isn't perfect. I do love the Kindle a lot. At 10oz, I always have my book club book within reach!"
2,Wow for Cost & Services,"I would buy it if the services I now get for free on the internet(newspapers, magazines etc) did not cost money on this expensive device.Provide free services and lower the price and it's a winner!"
1,BEWARE - SHIPPING DELAY OF 2 TO 3 WEEKS!,"This is not a review of the Kindle itself since I haven't been able to purchase one yet. I was trying to purchase one for a birthday present, but I've subsequently found out that they are on back order despite the fact that the site didn't tell me that. Needless to say, an estimated delivery date of December 3-5 won't work for a birthday on Nov 20.This is the second time that Amazon has ""hidden"" the delayed delivery date until the automated confirmation! I understand the economics of it (if the get you invested in the product you won't purchase something comparable from somewhere else), but I think it's deceptive.Just wanted to back sure no one else ran into the same situation. Thanks, Oprah for telling everyone about the product... Just beware you're now going to have to wait a while to get it! Sort of forseeable consequence that might merit extra production on Amazon's part! :)"
3,improvements are needed,"Although I do not have one yet, I have watched the demo video and I suggest some improvements such as color screen. By looking at the kindle screen it seems boring to me. The actual device looks fragile and simple in comparison with its cost. However, It is wonderful for the environment and convenient as one can carry huge amount of information in a relatively small gadget."
2,Kindle,"I was most intrigued when I saw this product on Good Morning America and went to Amazon to find out more. I am afraid that for $400 I would expect more. There is no connectivity with a PC, more so with a laptop; the network link is way too proprietary making it useless outside the US; it lacks a color screen, while not mandatory for $400 I would expect one, and; there is no description about security features regarding ordering and payment processes. What I do like is that it appears user friendly. For me I will wait until the next generation or for the price to drop down below $150."
2,Kindle Reading Device,"Kindle reading device is too costly,not worth the 30+ days of backorder. Unit has several engineering flaws.Unit will not stay in cover-slips out and pages are turned while putting unit back in. Keys to turn pages aretoo large for size of device. Pages get turned without readers knowledge. Too much time is wasted tryingto figure out where last page one was reading is located. I would not buy this device till bugs are out."
2,"Good idea, wrong decade","Even though I don't own the device, it is easy to notice the idea is great and convenient, but carrying this thing around is just terrible.This thing costs a lot of money for its size and lack of color screen, so I am sure the experience is far from reading a ""real book"". And for 400 bucks, buy a laptop please."
5,"Kindle, I go nowhere without it",This is the best thing I have purchased in a long time. I have had no trouble with it but many hours of reading!!!!! I give this Kindle 5 Stars !!!!!
4,Kindle Reading,"I am very happy with the Kindle that I recently purchased! It definitely saves space in my suitcase when traveling, and lightweight enough that I pretty much keep it in my purse with me all the time! Never know when the opportunity arises to catch some reading time! The only downside is the limited amount of books available at this time....hoping as time goes by that more and more titles are available!"
5,Kindle is brilliant,Kindle is well designed and I cannot think of many upgrades that would make it much better. Obviously a lot of engineering and thought went into the design. It's highly addictive.
3,"Charge for razor blades, not the razor","The product is interesting but extremely overpriced, especially considering that I still have to pay for books. Amazon needs to discover what Gillette figured out decades ago: Give away the razor, charge for the razor blades. In this model, every Joe gets a razor because he has nothing to lose. Then he discovers that he LOVES the razor, and to continue loving it he needs to buy razors for it. The rest is history.This e-book device should be almost free, like $30. If that were the case I'd have one tomorrow. Then I'd buy a book for it and see how I like it. If I fall in love with it, then I'll continue buying books, to Amazon's benefit.There is no way I'm taking a chance on a $400 dedicated e-book reader. That puts WAY too much risk on my side of the equation."
5,WoW!!!!,"I have had my kindle for just over a month now, Not a day have gone bye that I haven't used my kindle for at lest 1 hour. Having not to tote a lot a book with me every day, is great. I found that not only can I read long with out my eyes get tried, I read faster and more often. Get my book sent wireless with in second. The Kindle is so user-friendly."
4,No techno Geek,"I am one of those people who loves the new electronic age even though I am far from being either a teenager or a techno Geek! I am also one of those people who picks up a book late Saturday night or Sunday morning and reads until i finish on Sunday night; not something heavy but mysteries usually because I like to unravel puzzles. I love the Kindle for this. it is easier on my eyes than a book or a computer screen and I don't need to turn pages (although it does take some getting used to not resting my thumbs on he next page bar). it continues to amaze me that I just go to the menu, pick amazon Kindle and a book and it is downloaded in a matter of seconds. I don't even need to drive t a bookstore or wait for my order to arrive by UPS. My only complaint is that the most recent works of the more well known mystery writers don't appear very quickly."
4,I love my Kindle,"I love my Kindle the only cons I have found which I can live with are that it is not lighted and no page numbers. I have not quite figured out how to use the location feature yet. Otherwise I use mine all the time. I have a purse that I carry it everywhere I go. I never have to carry more then one book. Sometimes I finish a book and don't have a new one, but not any more. It's awesome. I have told all my friends and have suggested that they try it. I work for a recycle center and now I am green! No more books to find a place for after I finish and/or throw it away."
5,I am enjoying my Kindle,"I have had my Kindle for about a month and I am, on the whole, happy with it. I like the way my reading material is delivered so quickly and easily. I find the Kindle easy to use, easier to hold than a regular book and I like the option of changing the size of the print to suit the eyes. If I have any fault to find with Kindle it would be that I would like an easier way to go back through a book to find favorite passages. (If there is an easier way, I have not found it). I am happy to own Kindle and have no regrets about purchasing it."
5,Terrific device,"The only complaint I have about the Kindle is that it is far too easy to accidentally hit the page button, often simply by picking the thing up. Otherwise, after five weeks owning the Kindle, I disagree with those who complain about the slow page display (seems fine to me) or the occasional back flash. The display is great, the selection of books and periodicals is satisfactory, navigation tools are fine -- it's just a great way to buy and carry reading material. I love getting the NY Times directly to my Kindle every morning."
4,My Kindle,"I've had my Kindle for over a month now and it has been working great. I been an avid reader since I was young and I've tried to keep my books collection trim, but it just takes up so much room, the kindle should really help. The downloads were easy, both using the Kindle itself and downloading from the amazon site. It only took about ten seconds or less and the whole book was installed. The controls are a little annoying till you get use to them, you can accidentally twitch you finger and skip ahead three pages. After using it a couple of times and learning where to put my hand, it hasn't happened again. The cover that comes with it is almost useless, it doesn't really attach very well so using it while reading is a chore, I just use it to store it now. I've already read two books using it and I am very pleased with it."
4,The next best thing,My husband got my Kindle for me Christmas. I love that I can download books in less than a minutes. I love that I can sample books. I hooked up with my audible books and even downloaded my latest audio books. I am amazed with the reading screen. No reader's fatigue like when looking at a computer monitor. My only negative is the missing page numbers. I often flip back to other parts of the text when something new is revealed and I want to make a connection to another part of the text...this is hard to do. My 7 year old also loves it. I downloaded a couple of samples for him.
5,Love it !!!!,"I received this as a early christmas present and I love it. It had been sold out so I no idea that my husband had already got me one awhile back. It was so easy to get started and downloads books in less than a minute. I am an avid book reader so I was not sure how I was going to like this new concept but I am sold. My husband is excited as well because he can stop building me bookshelfs (ha ha). I was in the nail salon yesterday and was able to read with one hand as they were doing my other hand. I would highly recommend, the only suggestion I have is to maybe include the light with the case because you do need one if reading in dim light. I am ordering that today. Thanks again for a great product."
2,kindle fire and cloud drive acess,I have recently brought kindle fire and I have been using it since a month. I have few comments1. Amazon good app store however they like basic app for cloud drive access through amazon site. This would make easy to use the could drive.2. Power bottom is too bad. While using I have pressed unintentionally. Looks very cheap power buttom.3. Battery drains out lot fasert. I saw it draining out within 4 hours of book reading and web browsing. This definitely needs improvement.4. I like the home page it is very easy to locate apps and easy to use.5. Kindle retains Wifi very well in memoery. When I switch on it automatically recognise the network and ready to go..
1,Not Impressed...,"I just purchased a Kindle. I travel a lot and thought it would be a great thing to take along. Unfortunately, I have found that I really dislike the screen contrast. It's basically gray text on a lighter gray background. Very hard to read, especially in lower light -- and my vision is perfect. Also, the search capabilities are extremely limited. I am probably going to return this.... disappointing."
5,Great Way To Get Back Into Reading,"I love to read, always have, but takes me awhile to find a book I would like to read. While at a bookstore, or library it can take me awhile to find and choose a book I would like to read, and if I find one and buy it and learn I didn't like it, it stays on my shelf forever and doesn't get read. With the kindle I can hear about a book and right then get it a part of it to read and see if I like it. I don't have to be rushed while I finding a book I can look at my own pace and I can hold many many books and only carry the small device.The Kindle is great and very easy to use. Any one who thinking of getting on you won't regret it. Waiting will never be boring again."
1,Great Idea but horribly unbearable hardware design execution,"I was so excited watching the web promotional videos on this product and absolutely lusted at the idea of having such an innovative and life changing product. Unfortunately all is not well with the kindle. This has got to be one of the worst hardware design executions ever. I mean OMG, I could not even bare to finish reading the build in manual without continuously loosing my position because of these ridiculously placed oversized buttons.I wish the apple design team would have come out with this product as this was such a bad amazon execution I'd rather wait for Kindle 3.0 as 2.0 can't possible begin to address all the flaws this product comes with."
3,"NOT A REVIEW, JUST A QUESTION","I was wondering what happens when you buy this 400 dollar Kindle, and you pull it out of the box, and wait! No books! Well, wait a minute, I have about two hundred books upstairs that I would love the have on this thing. So basically, you pay 400 for this thing, then turn around and spent about 50 more the get this thing started. I wish they would incorperate a way that you can get the books you already own on it."
1,overpriced in all aspects,"the initial price as well as the ongoing prices are extreme to my thinking. but, there are always those whose idea of value is far from mine."
3,Love to read VS Reading for information,"I have no doubt that reading by way of the KindleKindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Deviceis the wave of the future. However, in spite of all the advantages of reading this way (and there are many) the #1 reason that I don't think this will replace my need for reading material on old fashioned printed paper is due to the joy I get in sharing*the page turner that I ""just"" finished last night, or the*article that I need to cut out and mail to my grandmother, or the one she sends to me.*There is also that set of books that I bought for my son 20 years ago that he now wants to share with his son.Kindle may be a big part of our future, but it's not THE future. Those of us that ""love to read"" will always NEED the book, magazine or newspaper, so that we may pass along the ingredients that taught us to love, so well."
1,Content,"Gee, 10 whole newspapers and nine magazines. Count 'em!For $399 you get a nicely designed and engineered device that: Will allow you to pay $9.99 for the very books you will walk by in the airport. Since it works on cellular tech will they even let you use it on the airplane?Free advice from a long time Amazon customer: More content! Lower the unit price ASAP. More Content! If I can get ALL my magazines and a serious slice Amazon's total e-inventory I would consider it at half this price. More content! Oh, and lest I forget: M O R E C O N T E N T!!!Sorry about the tone, but I am honestly that disappointed."
2,Kindle Wireless Choice is a HUGE Mistake,"Kindle uses the Sprint Network--a doomed network because it is is virtually alone in using a doomed proprietary format. The world uses GSM for cell/mobile/portable phone service (ATT, TMobile) You can't use a Sprint, Verizon or other phone when traveling to Europe or most other places. So you can't get your news subscriptions, download books, etc. That is a HUGE mistake--it lets out most international travelers, and that is the prime use I would want to have with the Kindle or any other such device. Fab design, idea and operation but Duhhh??? on it's market for travelers. Unlikely they will switch or add a Kindle II with GSM."
2,Kindle,"Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading DeviceI like the idea of the elctronic book: however, the design is flawed on the button size on the right and the power switches on the back when a protective cover is used. People should be allowed to purchase a book or group of books that are permnently contained in memory cards or be able to use flash drives fot their own personal information. When I pay $9.99 for a book I will want to own it, read, keep it and read it again oneday without repurchising the same book again. When you upgrade this product to include what I've mentioned above, I'll consider a purchase."
3,What would make me buy a Kindle,"I have used an Ebook reader for several years. I started with the Rocket, and have since upgraded. I fell in love with the Kindle from the description, and almost pushed the ""Buy"" button....then I realized the Kindle does not have a backlight. I know this may be insignificant to some readers, but I love a backlight. I can read in bed and my Husband does not complain about the lamp. I have used the clip on lights, and they do work fine, but the 3 types I have tried gobbled batteries!I can use a low backlight on my reader, and it still lasts 15 to 16 hours before I need to re-charge.Add a backlight feature and I want one!!"
1,need something for the visually impaired,for those of us who are blind or of low vision please consider a viewer that reads out loud. the closest thing on the market is thousands of dollars and does not download. maybe you and Kurzweil could get together. thanks ag
3,2009 Kindle,I heard there will be a new Kindle(2009) version. So I am going wait since they will have all the kinks worked out!
1,Not for people who love books,"This a great TOY for those who are simply fascinated with buttons. The old adage the ""if something is broken don't fix it"" is entirely appropriate for this TOY. The kindle is not designed or marketed to the avid reader: it was made for people who think that computers can be substituted for anything. Please do not buy this $400 TOY. It is NOT the same a holding a book in your hand, the feel of the pages, the smell of fresh ink, the artwork that comes on the cover. Curling up with a Kindle is akin to curling up with a blow up doll rather than a real woman."
1,The Death of Books,"I played with one of these this weekend and ABSOLUTELY HATE IT. It has taken all the fun out of reading REAL books: the smell of the ink, the satisfying turning of pages, etc. I suspect that this thing will take off and we'll no longer have libraries where you can actually TOUCH a REAL book. It will all be digital downloading. I hope it flops but don't think that it will.You'll have to take my REAL BOOK out of my cold, dead hands."
1,"No more plastic, please",You'll never replace the feel of a hardcover or the sweet smell of a paperback.
2,Too Expensive and not fully compatible with PDF,It has great concepts but I will not spent $400 to be beta tester. A good price range would be around $200. It must fully support complex PDF file. I really do need color but it should at leaset support 16 shade of grey.
1,You've got razors and printers here,"Can't say whether the Kindle works well or not, since I haven't bought one. But I can tell you why I didn't buy one.$400, that's why. The Kindle is the ebook equivalent of the razor and the inkjet printer. Make your money selling a gazillion books. Get the e-reader to as many people as possible ... with a low price.Then, if people aren't that tickled with certain aspects, no big deal. They don't feel so burned. They can use the unit when it suits the situation. They don't have to use it all the time just to justify the high cost.I assume Amazon will also have to fix the many problems described in other reviews. When they do that, and get the price down, down, down, there may be some possibilities here."
1,Price Puts Kindle Out of Reach,"I would love to review this product based on it's merits, but at $399 dollars it just isn't possible for me to do that.So instead I am rating it purely on it's price. And, frankly, that price keeps this device far out of the reach of many bibliophiles. It isn't like this is a product that's offering something brand new... you can still read a book, newspaper, or magazine without this device.The monetary advantage of the Kindle (cheaper digital books) doesn't really do a lot to offset to the initial price.And while the Kindle does offer some limited advantage of convenience, this is more than offset by the disadvantage: the loss of the physical presence of the book itself.I cannot see any of these ebook devices becoming practical until the price drops below (perhaps even well below) the $200 mark."
1,kindle original wireless reading device.,"I ordered this and i was excited about having the kindle. Amazon does not say that the kindle cannot be used in other countries, such as Trinidad. I was so disappointed when I could not use the kindle to download any books. I sent the kindle back to amazon after telling them my problem and not getting any reply. I am extremely dissatisfied with the service with this particular item."
2,Misleading Information,"When i bought my Kindle, the first generation, it was with the understanding that it would hold at least 200 books. I have less than 20 books and it's now telling me that i don't have enough memory. I only found out when I ordered a few books, most of them were not downloaded but my account was still charged. The battery who is supposed to be recharged every two days, only last a couple hours then i have to recharged. Amazon has provided erroneous information in order to overcharge customers for an item that does not function as described."
2,"I want some changes, but it's better than paper books","I use the Kindle constantly, the display is easy to read and the convenience can't be beat of portably carrying dozens of books on one device.Mine is constantly draining the battery, as I do not pack multiple adapters for recharging, I only pack USB cords and USB chargers.Alas - the unit will not use USB power to recharge. This is a gross error. Please allow current Kindle users to exchange for USB compatible recharging.The ""ergonomic"" buttons - I am constantly grabbing the unit by the edges, inadvertently advancing pages.The unit falls out of the supplied case, the retainer corners are on the wrong corners, such that the unit is always slipping or falling out of the case."
4,This would be great for student textbooks!,"My children and yours have had to carry super heavy backpacks full of bulky textbooks for ages. This would be such a cool thing for the kids to be able to have their text books in one spot without the ""lug"" factor!"
3,Almost Right,"It coulda been the iPod or iPhone for readers if: 1. it had a touch screen in color without the clunky-ness of the page buttons and thumb keyboard; 2 it had internet access with a decent browser so you could read more than Amazon and make use of hypertext, and 3. it at least allowed access to other formats like PDF, DOC, etc. so I could read my other stuff. The feel is a bit too prototype ... misses the elegance of fine, polished design.So ... it'll be useful to some people for some things, and it works fairly well at that, but I'll wait for version 2 or 3."
2,Too expensive if you must pay for content also,"Wake me up when it costs $150. Then maybe I'll be interested.Also, charging for somebody's FREE blog just seems wrong."
3,"satisfied, but hungry for more","I bought the Kindle to load books and take them to China. Since I am here for 2 months I didn't want to try to find or pack books. Unfortunately, I didn't load enough. I cant receive here in Guangzhou. i'm also surprised that the screen doesn't light to make it easier to read in low light conditions."
3,Macmillan - A customer who will not longer buy their books,Just a note to Macmillan and Amazon: Macmillan you can raise your prices to anything you want but we the consumer will decide if you will get any of our money. I can assure you that you will never see a dollar of mine if your books go beyond $9.99.You are not recognizing that your decades long business proposition has changed with the introduction of digital book readers and therefore your business model needs to change as well then you have your head in the sand.Others will make up their own mind but I believe there are many who will decide to not purchase your books. Your greed is endless.Enjoy explaining to your authors why their sales are going to decrease.There is a reason profits are up at Amazon - they keep prices low!
3,Why does this not work in South America,"I bought this specifically so my husband could download books in english while in South America. But it appears not to download while he is there. Has anyone else had this problem. Rather defeats the purpose of travelling with such a nice, small ""book""."
4,Sweet Escape,Just knowing I have it ready and loaded makes me a little excited to escape and read. If I could figure this out anyone can. Many thanks to the creators.
5,Kindle Book,I this think product is excellent. Already read two books with it and it is very user friendly. Would love to see a light developed which somehow runs off Kindle power source.
4,Kindle Got Me Reading Again,"It is extremely easy to browse the bookstore online or with the Kindle, and the huge selection is always available. This is a totally uncluttered way to add to the books I have at home, and I can read them at my convenience. It's far easier to read the book with my choice of font size than a small paperback. Overall the design is good, but it is easy to hit a forward/back button by accident and the device could be more secure in the case. The modem is subject to all of the vageries of cellphone signals. The people who suggest waiting for a new version are probably still driving a '97 Chevy and using an old PC. There is always going to be something better, but overall I am quite happy with my purchase."
4,Husbands Gift,"My husband loves his Kindle, but has had difficulty with the page turning buttons as they are located in a place that he continuely presses by accident."
5,This is the gold standard!,"Without question, the Amazon Kindle wireless reading device is the Gold Standard by which all others should be judged! You'll never need to kill another tree when using the Kindle. Everything you need is at your fingertips - wireless download of several hundred thousand books, magazines, newspapers and all at superior price savings!Easy to use, easy on the eyes, quickly download your favorites, never be without a book to read again - no matter what your genre!I bought one for my husband last Christmas - and before we knew it I was using it as much as he was. What could we do - he bought me one too.I travel a great deal and all I need to carry is the Kindle. I've been asked by other travelers who have heard of it - I think I've probably sold at least a dozen who have said they will order one asap. Maybe I should be charging a commission - ha!I'm picky about products, and never give a wholehearted endorsement - but this product is the exception."
5,Kindle is amazing!,"At first I wasn't sure how reading off of a screen would be. But after doing so for a couple of months, I'll never go back. My kindle has saved me from boring moments and the airport, doctor's office, and at home. I can get a book at a moments notice, which has been so great. Seriously, if you love reading and are tired of collecting books on shelves, and like easy access to books...this is the device for you."
5,E-Z is the best way to go,I found my Amazon Kindel to be a great way to spend my reading time. When I travel I don't need to bring along 2 or 3 books or newspapers just my Kindel. Vary lite and E-Z to hold. My next one will be for my wife
5,Technical issues,A book which I was reading mysteriously disappeared from my Kindle. A call to customer service did not resolve the situation The follow up response which was promised more than 24 hours ago has not arrived. All the other books are there and readable.
2,Too restrictive,"Why should I pay $400 for a Kindle when I already read ebooks on my Palm in many different formats, at lower prices, from different sources including the public library, plus having my contacts, calendar, various personal lists & documents all on the same device? My ebook library on memory cards & on computer runs about 500 books & is still growing. As I understand it, a Kindle would restrict me to just reading material purchased from Amazon. I like Amazon, but I also like the short stories I can purchase at Fictionwise; I even read fanfiction on my pda. A Kindle just doesn't make sense for me."
1,BUYER BEWARE- FRAGILE - AMAZON WILL NOT GIVE A DAMN,"I love my Kindle. That being said, it is poorly designed considering how fragile it is. The cover is not made to hold it securely, and if you don't use the cover, you are holding the actual Kindle with buttons on both sides that you do not want to touch for fear of losing your page. Hence, I kept it in the non-secure cover and yesterday it slipped out and dropped two feet onto the carpet, game over. Lines appeared on the screen, I called support and they ""graciously"" (total sarcasm) replaced it for a mere $180 (does not include shipping). I was told the wires are very delicate, so why not warn people? Why not make a cover that holds the Kindle securely?! The cover is AWFUL!!! I had it only three months and Amazon took me for the initial $359 plus now the additional $180 dollars. I think Amazon has lost site of it's customer base. I actually despise them at this point. NEVER DROP OR IT AND YOU ARE TOAST."
3,My Kindle,"I went to Kauai for my vacation and decided to purchase a Kindle before leaving, downloaded two books, which I read, and tried to down load again another book but Sprint does not work on the North end of the island, lucky I had my laptop which did the trick. Other wise love it for looking up words also.Ron"
4,I love this!,"I tried to use a pocket pc as a book reader for several years, but was continually frustrated by having to reinstall the reader if the battery went dead. Yeah! No problem with the Kindle. It is easy to read, and has such versatility in that you can not only download books, but get your own documents converted. And the books are reasonable priced so it's not hard on the budget. My only wish would be that it was backlit so you could read in the dark. Thank you Amazon."
4,It's great ...but,I've had my Kindle for a couple of weeks now. It's really great. The screen is awesome and feels just like a regular book. I sometimes catch myself reaching down to turn the page. I also love having a new book just a few clicks away when I finish one up. There is only one negative that I've found so far. That is the availability of new releases. I'm hoping that this is only temporary and will improve once the Kindle is more established because I'm having a tough time finding any of the new releases that I've been looking forward to.
4,Don't Be Without One,"The Kindle is the greatest way to get new books FAST! I love that you can read a whole chapter of a book BEFORE you buy it! Just like being at the book store! It took me a while to stop accidently ""turing the page"" while holding my Kindle. But it was so easy to navigate and get my place again. I can even look up words I don't know, right there on the Kindle! And the source of books available is amazing and growing daily!"
2,Nice device for nonacademic use,"I would greatly appreciate being able to cite page numbers for essays, as well as gain access to all footnotes."
1,very disappointed,I would never buy another amazon kindle. We r on our 3rd one in 6 months. It keeps freezing up and lines keep appearing all over the screen. Very disappointed and will NEVER buy another one.
4,The answer to a mobile reader's enjoyment,"I love to read and knit. I have tried audio books and do occasionally still use them, however, they are very expensive and you need to resist distraction to use them successfully. I have had my Kindle for about 2 months and have been able to finish about a book each week beacuse I can carry it in my purse. It was suggested to me I read a current best seller recently. After checking on my Kindle, I discovered it was part of a series and was able to buy the 1st book in the series while eating lunch out and begin reading immediately instead of starting with the ""recent"" book which is the 7th book in the series. Kindle is a liitle ""pricey"" but worth it to an avid reader. The battery lasts about a week if you turn off the Wireless when not in use. My only suggestion is; it would be nice to be able to hold it on the right side without accidentaly turning a page, maybe a smaller spot for page turning on the sides. Get one it's great!"
4,my kindle,"outstanding....just wish they found a better place for the levers which advance and return the pages, I find myself always hitting them when I'm reading which is a pain. This is the future of reading!!!Love it!!!!"
3,Almost top drawer,"An unusual story, the language was skilled and inviting. Only problem was I wanted more and felt that the characters had something else to tell us. The main point is the story had me caught up and that's what counts. Just too short in length"
2,Lines on my screen,"I really loved my kindle while it worked. I just started using it about 6 months ago even though it was given to me as a gift a couple years back. During the last several monthes I have become quite fond of this devise. It has now developed lines across the screen and since the warranty has expired, I can only replace it with a $70 - $100 kindle. It is too bad that the screen isn't durable."
2,Kindle not very safe for children.,"Bought a kindle for our five year old,turns out there is no'real' parental controls. The app that is supposed to protect the kids needs to be signed into every time the kindle is turned on. That means if even 1 time it doesn't get signed in that our five year old would have access to every violent or perverse app or movie that is available on Amazon. Aside from being potentially dangerous for kids it actually worked fairly well. We are returnig it to the store today and trying to find something more kid safe."
4,Hopeful but expensive... iPhone may win...,"I love reading books on portables devices and computers... I have bad eyes and reading regular books, specially new ones with light ink, is difficult for me unless there is bright light in the room...I just purchased this and look forward to testing it and hoping I don't have to return it...I think it's too expensive considering Palm devides are half the price. Native support for pdf would be nice and that could come in an upgrade...Now, I love my iPhone a lot. If someone writes an eBook reader for it, I woul dbe hard-pressed to use this one...Kindle book selection, however, seems huge...I hope this succeeds... Classry launch..."
1,Jury's Still Out,"So I get my Kindle -- excited as can be. But am HUGELY disappointed in Amazon right now. Not only did I pay for expedited shipping but it appears I have a ""defective"" unit but their tech people need 2-3 days to figure this out? I'm in Ann Arbor, MI, so even though it's very connected, and it shows 5 solid bars I'm unable to connect.If I do the sensible thing and send it back, and reorder another one using the nifty Oprah coupon for $50 off (that expires tomorrow) I should get one that's OK. What if their tech people in 3 days tell me ""oh, your unit is fine."" Then I'm SOL if I want another one, eh?Truly a disappointment in customer service. They shoulda had be box it up yesterday and send it back and had a new one in my hands today."
5,Love it,"The Kindle is great for what I wanted it for; reading books. Another benefit is no more book cases. Criticisms in other reviews may be valid, but I'm very happy. It's right for me"
4,Kindle Rocks!,"I've enjoyed using the Kindle very much. There have been some things that took a bit to get used to (I've lost my place a time or two by accidently pushing the page button), but over all it has been easy to use. I would love it if the Kindle had a backlight option so I could read in the dark, but that is the only addition I would make to it."
4,kindle,"I love the convenience of carrying around this light literary gem, instead of lugging my heavy novels. I've been reading more than ever because it's so simple to use and I love the dictionary that's included. The price of books and the convenience of ordering makes this product so enticing. The part that is awkward, however, is the placement of the wide ""next page/previous page"" bars which I keep accidentally pressing after turning it on. Please design the future Kindle with smaller bars and also a power switch in front, instead of the back. Other than that, it's a wonderful product! The best part is, that it'll pay for itself after buying 35 books! How great is that!"
4,Great way to help the environment!,"I know that sounds like a corny tag line for this review but my aunts got myself and my sister a kindle. I received it on Thanksgiving. Once I opened the package and bought a book I was pretty much sold. This is a fantastic device. I am all for buying less paper in my life, I have too much clutter as it is and I do love reading. Honestly I have issues reading books and plays off computer screens and I love this device, no problems with the screen at all. It looks just like my regular books. I also don't have to hold down the pages when I'm all the way near the end of the book! At any rate, the Kindle is a little slow to load the next page, and I wish there were page numbers because I show it off to friends and often end up losing my place. Other than that, I love it because I can always have a book on me!"
5,Kinldle is wonderful!,"I love the Kindle. It is so easy to use, and I like the way the print size can be changed. I take it everywhere. Now I won't have to fill my house with books. I also like the book reviews,and the free samples. That way I can read part of the book before I decide to buy it."
4,LOVE IT...................,"I LOVE MY KINDLE, AND SO DOES EVERYONE THAT HAS SEEN ME USING IT. I'M GOING ON A CRUISE SOON, AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING LOTS OF READING AT MY FINGERTIPS WHILE I LOUNGE BY THE POOL THE ONLY PART OF THE KINDLE I DON'T LIKE, ARE THE TURN PAGE BUTTONS. HAVING THEM LOCATED ON BOTH SIDE OF THE KINDLE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MOVE AROUND WITH IT. YOU INADVERTENTLY WILL HIT THE BUTTONS, TURNING YOUR PAGES. I HOPE THE NEXT GENERATION OF KINDLE WILL PLACE THE TURN PAGE BUTTONS IN A BETTER LOCATION."
5,I LOVE THE KINDLE!!!!,I really have enjoyed the Kindle. Anyone who likes to read would enjoy the Kindle. I have downloaded six books the first day I had the kindle. My eyes don't strain with the screen and I don't feel tired as I read like I do with print. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE KINDLE!!!!!
1,What's in a name?,"What idiot named this device? ""Kindle"" it makes me think of book burnings!!! Ignorant and offensive. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burningsNo PDF support! Give me a break.Amazon should re-name and redesign this."
1,Worthless,I received this item this week and purchased a book for my kindle. Before I even finished the book the kindle froze (the same page was displayed and would not change even when the device was turned off). Also when I reviewed the books for sell through the Kindle (I'm a science fiction buff) I could not find any I liked.
4,"Satisfied with Kindle, but not with Amazon","When we purchased the kindle the price was at $399.00. I had not received my Kindle as of May 29th and you had cut the price by $50.00. I sent you an email expressing my concern with the price reduction and can I be reimbursed for the difference or just credit it to my account and I never heard from anyone from Amazon. You pride yourself in replying to any questions concerning the Kindle, but when a question is sent to you, no one replies to it.Your customer service needs to be improved.Barb Shadler"
5,Moi's Review,"I received my Kindle as a gift for my anniversary. I commute everyday and it's so great not to have to carry around a bunch of heavy books. Everything I want to read is self contained.We also just got back from an vacation in Vegas and while waiting at the airport for our flights and sitting for a long time on the plane it was very handy. No more taking books on vacation, all I need is my Kindle."
4,Kindle,Wonderful easy product to own. If you are an avid reader this is by far an item that will save you tons of money in the long run. My high school children who love to read are begging me for their own.
4,Love it - just one little problem,I absolutely love my Kindle. I purchased it around Thanksgiving for myself and for Christmas purchased one for my boss who travels a great deal and is a big reader.I am totally enjoying it except for one minor thing. It doesn't come on lately without plugging it in and reseting it. In the past week I have had to reset with a paperclip about 6 times. Strange. If this is something other people are having problems with I won't worry about it.
2,warranty issue,"My Kindle2 was bought in May, 2011. It broke and was replaced under warranty in January 2012. In July, 2012, with no known precipitating factor, the machine froze and could not be rebooted. Congratulations to Amazon for phenomenal response time on the phone, but raspberries for not backing a second defective device. I was told the warranty was over. I expected the warranty to be from the date of the replacement. I was offered a $20 discount on another replacement, but I declined. My experience is the device is too unreliable to invest more cash. It worked fine, when it worked, and I was not a heavy user. But, I will be looking to put my money in a different device. Sorry, Amazon, it was fun while it lasted."
5,Love it,"I love everything about this thing. I see an enormous future for it.I used to sell textbooks and each of them weighed about 5 pounds. When a kid had homework in Biology, American History and chemistry they could hardly get home without a pack animal! If the textbook companies will get into this a student could have his entire year of textbooks loaded into a 10 ounce Kindle. I can't imagine anything more advantageous to the kids, the school districts, and the environment! You Go guys!"
2,Early adoption = lack of features,"This may be the beginning of a new trend that will help to cut down on the use of printed paper, which is a good thing, but at $399, this device has a huge markup, and huge net for Amazon. There's absolutely no reason why this device should not cost $100 or less.Early adopters, enamored with a mobile e-book, who are willing to spend an exorbitant price for a gadget with a tiny screen, are forgetting the fact that newspapers and magazines are printed in color. Although a novel would be great on this little screen, I wouldn't want to deal with the eyestrain of using it daily to read periodicals.Like any technology, it's just a matter of time before a new model is offered for half the price, repeat, repeat, repeat, and you have a $49 e-book with color. I'll wait."
1,"so far, so dissapointed","I ordered a kindle based upon reviews on amazon. just received it today and was excited to set up and purchase some books i had been holding off on. Opened the box - device was smaller and lighter than expected, decent ergonomics, good type, now on to ordering. Can download magazines and newspapers but when i go to download purchase books it tells me that because of geographic restrictions my order can't be filled. ??? I live in pittsburgh. Used the amazon callback service - what a hoot - I can live with offshore helpdesks and English a a second language but this operator knew so little english it was comical. after promising me a manager who never showed up on the phone, I hung up. Why not try email support thats always been good. 6 hours later and still waiting. unfortunately the personalized letter from Jeff Bezos doesn't come with an email address."
5,Kindle,"The Kindle is great. It is easier to read in bed and if your eyes get tired, you just increase the size of the print. I take it with me in case I have time to read a little. I have a book on the Kindle for my grandnephew and he enjoys reading with the Kindle."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. The screen looks great! Easy to read, decent battery life. I was surprised how light it is for its size."
5,Not A Techy,"I am a big fat ZERO when it comes to anything high tech, low tech, new tech, I don't even text...you get the picture. My husband purchased this for me (for Christmas) before Oprah finished talking the day she had it on her show. It came already registered to me and ready to go. I loaded my first book 5 minutes out of the box. I love this thing!! It is great for dinasours like me that came into this century kicking and screaming. I have lots of people around me that are readers and I show everyone my Kindle. It is incredibly easy to use. The fact that my books will be in one place and never lost is the best. Books are cheaper too!"
5,Wow,"This is what I have been waiting for, I read very fast so I end up with a lot of books I have no room for, But no one shares my interests to give them away. The kindle performs as advertised,My vision is not the best so the high contrast text is great and enlarging the text helps also."
4,NOT FOR NON ELECTRONIC PEOPLE,I bought the kindle for my mother. She doesn't have a computer because she hates technology so I guess it was a bad idea to get her a kindle but she loves to read so it seemed like a good idea at the time. Thanks Oparah! Also the idea of getting the German newspaper in real time seemed great. She has returned it to me and I have regifted it to my husband who seems to think he will like it.I think it's a wonderful product in that books are very cheap to purchase. My mother had trouble maneuvering around it. She could not find her last read page each time she turned it on. She kept clicking forward and backward accidently. The keypad was too small for her to read as well.These will not be issues for my husband.
5,Fabulous,"I ordered my kindle after viewing it on Oprah's show. Loved the discount, and wish it would happen again. I have traveled twice since getting it and cannot believe how much I'm enjoying not carrying tons of books while traveling. Hope some of the books that are available for downloading drop more in price. I'm saving many of the kindle books to read only when flying. Looking for a protective case that will give more protection than what I currently have. Greatest item I've seen and used since I-Pod."
5,"AWESOME, worth the money- if you can get your hands on one","I will have to admit, when Oprah showed this product on her show and showed it with such enthusiasm, I had to look into the Kindle. It is great. You save money, trees, space, and you can ""carry"" as many books as you want with you. The only kinks I would have to say are: You have to be careful when you first handle it to not turn pages accidentally, and be careful when inserting the Kindle into the cover because it isn't always secure inside the cover. Lastly, if the power button wasn't on the back, which means you have to lift it out of the cover, then maybe it wouldn't be given a chance to come loose and fall out. BUT...none of these ""flaws"" would make me not buy this all over again. I LOVE MY AMAZON KINDLE. Maybe one these of days it will be able to have the capability to add color and maybe even comic books !!- A lucky and happy Kindle owner"
5,Love my Kindle,"Read my first book on the Kindle while doing my ""daily"" treadmill exercise. I changed the font to the largest it will go and I had no problems reading while exercising. Made the time go by faster and more enjoyable too! No worries about the book falling off or difficulty turning pages, just click and the Kindle goes to the next page. Neat!"
4,Highly recommend,"The Kindle is a wonderful tool for students and a wonderful gift to those that read for entertainment. It's easy to use and compact making it easy to carry. Adjustable font make it easy to read whether you're in your easy chair or jogging on the treadmill. After placing an order for a book, it's downloaded onto your Kindle in less than a minute and the cost is normally less than half the price of a hardback.A drawback that I've found annoying at times is that not all books are available, but this is due, I believe, to the author or publisher not making the book available for downloading. Another drawback is that you can't lend a good book to anyone, unless you're willing to hand over your Kindle.All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
5,fix your kindle cover for almost nothing,"I received my Kindle for Christmas. This thing just amazes me. At first, I doubted that it would impress me. Wow, was I wrong. This thing is simply amazing.I've read a lot of complaints about the buttons being too easy to push when holding it. The Kindle was designed to stay in its cover. Only problem with that is that the stock cover does not securely hold the Kindle in place.I figured out a cheap (almost free) and easy way to cure that. I simply placed a 1-inch strip of sticky-back velcro on the back of the Kindle and inside the stock cover and presto, it stays put.Sure, I would love to have one of those fancy after market covers, but being the cheapo that I am, the velcro fix works great. Give it a try.I hope you enjoy your Kindle as much as I have. Really, this thing is right up there on the list of cool techno gadgets. I love it."
5,Kindle is great!,"My husband and I decided to try the Kindle, and the only problem is that both of us want to use it at the same time. It is easy to use and convenient to hold. We love it!"
5,Nothing much to add...,"There are so many reviews already, I have nothing much more to add, but I did want my five star opinion to count toward the average that is being dragged down by so many reviews from people who don't even own one.A great device.Colin"
3,kindle 1.1,"I like this project. I can totally see why people get into the newer, fancier ones! I commute on a train every day, and the Kindle gives me something to read, without flopping a newspaper on other people's faces, or carrying a heave book. The Kindle 1.1 does have some design flaws for me. I have big hands, and it can only be held in a narrow area. Holding it by the edge changes the page. On the other hand, it has internet access just about everywhere, which is more than I can say for my antique phone. The particular unit I got doesn't seem to play music. I got a 16gb card for it, loaded a bunch of MP3 files from iTunes, but the 'Play' function doesn't work. Not a fate worse than death, but annoying, none the less. Basically, for the price I paid, I am pretty happy with the little guy."
4,A Slightly Flawed Marvel,"On whole, I am delighted with my Kindle.The selection of available titles is nothing less than impressive. I do have one complaint though: the ""paddle"" controlling the ""next page"" function, particularly on the right side should be smaller as any handling of the unit results in advancing a page or two (it is difficult to position the unit in it's cover without advancing a page). Another suggestion, would be to scrap the retainer ""card"" on the cover and find a way to fasten the Kindle to the cover corners with some sort of spring release, which would make the former problem less pressing. These are annoyances that in no way reduce the viability of the unit and has solved my book storage problem and with a font that I can read---win,win!"
3,great start turned annoying quickly,"I've had the newest version of Kindle for just under a month. Start up was easy, downloading books lightening fast. Then the trouble began. More than half the time when I wake it up, my bookmark has moved way back to the beginning of the book. Now I can't wake it up at all without rebooting it every time, which means starting back at chapter one every single time. Wish I'd listened to my freinds and bought the Nook."
4,Kindle needs a more flexible dictionary-setting option,"The Kindle is a great tool for readers and students, but there's always room for improvement: More and better ""look-up enabled"" e-dictionaries - especially interlingual ones - are becoming available all the time. (I use a few on my Kindle already, and am developing several of my own as MOBI-books.) However, the opportunities for smoothly integrated dictionary cross-referencing are really stifled on the Kindle right now (software version 3.0.1) by the need to assign a single default dictionary across the entire device. Why can't I assign an English dictionary to my English books, a Spanish one to Spanish-language books, Latin and Greek ones to books in my classical languages collection? Can't believe a software tweek wouldn't make this possible... What do you think, Amazon geeks?"
1,"Abysmal Durability, Poor Warranty","I loved my Kindle until I took it out of my backpack and it's screen was frozen in a weird, glitchy image. It was the only thing in bag and other than picking it up and putting it down, it suffered no great trauma. Amazon claimed it was my fault and charged me for a replacement, but I think that it's a design flaw for a portable device to be so breakable. Even if you do buy this, be warned that you should treat it more like a fragile laptop than a mobile phone or, you know, an actual book.Also, there are real problems with battery life - it worked as advertised for about a month, at which point a daily charge suddenly became necessary. Amazon touts the fact that eInk doesn't need power to hold an image, but after about a month of use, the Kindle could barely make it through a night without losing all power (and yes, the wireless switch was off)."
1,Kindle Useless Outside a Major US City,"I teach technology-based communication at a postsecondary institution so I was thrilled to see the advent of an easily accessible electronic book. I was thinking of the thousands of dollars that my students waste on textbooks that will be irrelevant as soon as the course is over, the trees saved, the ability to update instantly...DO NOT buy this item if you are ever out of the country, do not live in a major metropolitan area, intend to use it, as described, for mobility convenience. The range of my Kindle has been greater NYC. I have tried to upload in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, upstate NY, Bellingiham, WA, and the San Juan Islands. Nothing. I have also attempted to use it in Vancouver and Toronto. Nothing. The claim was that anywhere there is a cellphone signal, the Kindle should find a wireless connection. Well, mine seems to be permanently searching. What a watse of good technology."
4,Love it but not without flaws,"I have the 3G New Gen. Kindle. Have returned it twice unfortunately, I am on my 3rd one. First one was only month and half old could not get it out of sleep mode. Second one was only 2 weeks old, same issue, couldnt get it out of sleep mode. Have to say Amazon has been great when it comes to helping to try and satisfy my disapointment as I want to love this device but get very frustrated when I cant get it to turn on. I cant be the only person with this issue???"
5,Flying with your Kindle,"For those that fly the friendly skies......this is a purchase that you will never regret. I was tortured the last few weeks as I waited on my Kindle because I seemed to be sitting by new Kindle owners on every flight. To all of you, thanks for answering my many questions and convincing me that I was going to be happy with my purchase.....I am!I am never content with reading one book at a time and it is such a burden to carry more than one hardback in your bag. The screen is so easy to read and I can change the font size when the lighting is poor. The price will probably come down and future modifications will most likely occur... but I will have enjoyed so many books by then.....books that would be sitting in a stack at home while I was in a city far away, wishing that I had them with me!"
5,Great Device,"After seeing the Kindle on the Oprah show, I researched it on Amazon more. I was sold. The features of the Kindle and what it offers are terrific. I havent even begun to use it to its full potential. I've tapped into the other features but having books to read was my main reason for the purchase. I dont have to worry what to do with all the books I buy. Now I can store thousands of books and information right on my Kindle. This is a great product and I recommend it to anyone who reads."
5,I am soooo addicted!!!!!,"I am soooo addicted to my Kindle!!!!! I purchased the Kindle on a whim as I was taking a long flight in a few days and did not want to bring several books with me. I have never been so happy with a purchase in my life. I am finding the Kindle a great aid in finding new authors and genres that I would not have tried before. Being able to download a sample (which takes less then a minute, even for entire novels!!!) is a great help. I will still purchase physical books as there are times when I need the feel of a solid book but the Kindle definately is an aid to my reading ""addiction""."
5,Kindle is a great new way to read,I am having a blast using Kindle! I've downloaded a few spy novels (some old Paperbacks) and some great bulk classics-- Mark Twain and F Scott Fitzgerald -- short stories and novels. I enjoy how easy it is to carry it around and have a very easy time reading my books. I can change the print size which helps a lot if my eyes are worn out on a particular day. I've had trouble reading little paperbacks for a long time and I can read them now on the Kindle. I can buy books any time and at very low cost -- it's been a great experience so far!
2,used books are much cheaper!,"while I like the idea of using less paper, I like the idea of saving money more. this is still too expensive, and I also like collecting books. I guess that's why I still buy LP's off of amazon. Who's with me?"
1,"No content, froze several times","I bought the device for my wife for Mother's day. She is an avid reader of romance novels.First, the device froze and had to be reset twice in about four times we tried to use it.Then, when she tried to buy content, not a single one of the recent, best selling romance titles she wanted were available. Few of her favorite authors had and content available, notably, there were none by Danielle Steel."
3,It is just OK. Too bad it can not view PDF files directly.,"I bought this ebook reader mainly to view my collection of PDF documents with math formulas and computer codes.Even though I can convert PDF files either through Amazon or with Mobipocket creator, both just messed up inline math formulas or computer codes to totally unreadable.This totally ruined my original purpose to buy this product. So I promptly required a return and I am going to Sony Reader which is $100 less and can read PDF documents directly.One good point regarding Kindle: it takes much less time to turn a page than on Sony Reader PRS505."
4,Great Product,"I am very happy with my Kindle with the exception of two minor details. The buttons on the side are large and it is easy to press them without intending to and the Kindle does not attach to the cover very securely and tends to fall out. Other than this I am very happy and an enjoying traveling with a compact, never ending supply of reading material."
5,Amazon's Kindle is truly amazing,"This device is to readers what the IPODs and MP3s are to music lovers. I have had my Kindle for two weeks and still am amazed that it is really like reading a book. To be able to download a book almost anywhere, any time and begin reading it with a minute, is a outstanding benifit. I am finding books to download that I have wanted to read for years. This is my favorite piece of electronic equipment. Great Job Amazon!!!"
4,Reading works but the page buttons don't lock,I've had my Kindle for 3 days and I love reading on the train or even at home in fairly low light. Ordering books is easy and convenient.My only criticism so far is that the next page buttons are too sensitive and too easy to click. You have to turn off the Kindle when carrying it in your bag because otherwise it pages forward automatically. Turning it off is a bit of a pain because the switch is on the back. You have to take it out of the case and then put it back.
2,"""Mission Accomplished"" by Charles Todd","This Kindle book when I first read it was so full of errors as to be almost unreadable. It is as if someone ran a really insane version of Auto-Correct on it. Punctuation, spelling, line breaks, words--there are serious errors on almost every page. ""Taunt"" has been used throughout for ""taut,"" ""catapult"" for ""capitulate,"" and so on through a very long list; ""your"" and ""you're"" are used interchangeably, ""there,"" ""their,"" and ""they're,"" etc. This is a defective product, as much as a water glass with a hole in the bottom.The story itself is not very well told and rather simplistic in conception and execution. It doesn't read like the other work of Charles Todd. In fact, although Kindle lists it as being by Charles Todd, I can find no other mention of it in any source I have consulted. I wonder if the whole thing is not a practical joke by someone malicious."
2,Optimistic,"My biggest problem with this product is the fact that I cannot get thelittle tab to hold the Kindle in its cover. Can someone help me withthis. Otherwise, I think I am going to enjoy it very much."
3,Suggested improvements,"Although I thought the Kindle was great, it has some flaws for the elderly and those who cannot see well. I recommend the following, if possible:1. Use black print on the keys vice grey.2. Make the keys larger.3. Make the maximum font size the same as ""Large print"" books."
3,Almost there,"I just got my kindle today after reading MANY reviews, and for the most part I am pleased. I've been playing with it and exploring all the features mentioned in the user guide, and here are my thoughts:GOOD--The screen is incredibly readable--Pages turn fast--able to transfer files over usb--can look up definitions--can make notes and highlight passages--lightweightBAD--keyboard is awkward to use--Previous button is not where I want it... instead I keep hitting next--Doesn't read pdfs--Can't read the evdo network my cell phone is using (and they are right next to each other!)For the most part, I like it. I'd love to have the things in the bad list fixed, but I can forgive it because I can work around it and get used to it. But what I really wanted it for was ease of reading and ability to make notes, and it gets an A+ for that.I'm going to Chicago in a week so hopefully the evdo will work there. If not, then I may have to have it fixed."
3,I'm addicted,I love it! I'm addicted; It's terribly convenient when traveling and more convenient to use at the gym than a hardcover or paperback book. I just wish that more books were available in the Kindle Edition.
5,OMGoodness!,"OMGOODNESS!!! Everyone should have a Kindle!! I read on the average at least 10 books all at the same time. I often find myself in the most peculiar reading situations and positions! The Kindle is wonderful for my reading habits. I carry my Kindle every where! The minute I see a book or CD's I might want, I quick go to my kindle and log into the ""Kindle Store"". I search for my item and ""ZIP""! There they are in less then 30 seconds on my Kindle. Now, the music has to be down loaded to your computer and then load them onto your Kindle. The ""Look-up"" feature for definitions for words your not familiar with is fantastic!! I recommend that everyone buy and download the ""Kindle Users Guide"". I have not had the opportunity to use the scan documents feature or the email. Buttt...! Everyone needs a KINDLE!;) I LOVE this thing!!!"
2,"good product, but those buttons","got the kindle yesterday, returned it today. It is a great idea and reading on it was easy and fun, but everytime you touch the kindle in any way, even to push it back into its cover, i inadvertantly changed the page. Worse than that is if you hit the 'back' button by accident, which is very easy to do, it will take you minutes to refind your page. The page numbering system is not intuitive at all, the cover should never have been created because the kindle keeps sliding out of it. I really have no idea how anybody can pay $359 for such a frusrating gadget. I will howver try it again after they update the hardware."
2,Kindle Disappointment,"I returned my Kindle for 2 main reasons:(1) The screen was much too dim in any light.(2) The books must have been selected by a non-reader with a 2-digit IQ. Not one book by Philip Roth, one of our greatest writers. Also missing: Nobel, Pulitzer and Booker-Mann yearly prizes. I would think you would consider serious readers of fine fiction, not just best sellers on the NYT list."
3,Kindle,"Great Product - Although my residence is outside the coverage area for downloads. So, I have to download when I travel to another town."
2,"connectiviity bad, and that's only the first problem","I happily awaited my Kindle and my[ [ASIN:B000FI73MA Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device]] and my jump into the ebook, but this was not the device I had hoped for. First, the RF signal didn't connect to my ebook, despite the fact that my cell phone (Verizon system) works fine here; frustration was a biggie.When I tried to download books from the Kindle store via USB, the system didn't connect. So I can't get the books I want.Then, the little numbers on the screen and the work keyboard are so small I must use a magnifying glass to read them. I bought the kindle so that I could enlarge the font, what about making the keyboard letters and symbols bigger.I'm really disappointed. I looked forward to taking lots of books in my Kindle on an Alaska vacation. Now I'll have to go back to good old Gutenberg."
2,Cumbersome,"having just purchased I was rather surprised at the overall feel of the unit. While it is very convenient to download, the process of reading your digital book is difficult....the print is great and readable, but try to hold this unit and turn pages requires a great deal of patience...pages change sometimes with the slightest brush of your hand..most of all...it is very difficult to hold....probably should have gone with the Sony....George"
4,Kindle,"Easy to use, minimal space needed during travel and in my purse. Wish it had a light included."
4,Still new at it,"I just finished reading ""Fleeced"". I am trying to get the next book but Kindle does not recognize my request. I like the kindle, but if the books I want are not available......Who needs kindle??I wanted the articles ""sights and Insights"" from IBD newspaper subscription. I had to make a concession there. The section has usually 8 articles and kindle usually has just four.I gave kindle 4 stars because I do like it, but.....Joe"
5,Kindle,"I was really hesitant about buying a Kindle and wanted to see one. I found I was reading reviews daily and decided to bite the bullet. I am chemically sensitive and am unable to read a newspaper because of the formaldehyde. It is a wonderful feeling to come downstairs in the morning, pour my coffee and turn on my Kindle. I now enjoy my daily paper and I don't even have to go outside to get it. I can honestly say that this is one of the best purchases that I have made. The support team is wonderful and only a quick phone call away. I love my Kindle and only wish that I had bought one sooner."
5,A great innovation,This product is remarkable. I love the way the screen operates and allows for selecting from a number of font sizes. I also love the ease with which you can purchase and instantly download a new book.
4,Kindle Electronic book,My son is really enjoying this gift! He is an avid reader and has boxes and shelves loaded with books--this lets him continue reading new material and not create more clutter! He is pleased with how easy it is to go online and order new books.
5,I love my Kindle!!!!,I got my Kindle as a gift from my husband about five months ago and I just love it!!! I carry it with my everywhere. I read it everywhere and I can buy and download books where ever!!! I just love it!!!!
1,Why you shouldn't buy a Kindle,"I wrote a review of the Kindle back in March of 2008, soon after I bought my first one. At that time I was totally enthusiastic and named the review ""Why You Should Buy Amazon's Kindle Book Reader."" The text of that original article appears below.Since then that first Kindle broke. Then the replacement broke. Then the replacement of the replacement broke. In each case, there was no physical damage. The screen simply froze with an afterimage that obscured the display of any new text. Telephone support was prompt to answer my call and did not sound surprised when they heard about the problem. But they had no solution, other than replacing the device. I have run out of patience. I now use a Nook instead.Richard Seltzer, B&R; Samizdat ExpressKindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device"
4,Kindle Review,"The Kindle is a joy to use. I have only one problem. Holding the dam thing is difficult, as there is no place for your fingers. As a result I inadvertently and constantly press page forward or page backward . . .The case it comes with does not hold the Kindle securely. If it did, one could hold the case and the device would remain secure."
4,rockylyn,Love this item. My only complaint is the page tuner bar is so long and super sensitive to touch that it is easy to accidentally hit it and turn the page (which I did often).
4,product design,Kindle is a wonderful product but when it is on its like a ticking bomb which will go off unless handled with extreme care.I don't know why it has 2 very long bars to move a page.1 or 2 buttons would acclomplish the same result and allow a user to pick it up without the fear of advancing 1 or more pages.I also don't understand why you can't shut it off entirely to better save battery power.
5,love it,I thought long and hard before making this purchase but I am so glad I did. It is wonderful I just wish all the books I wanted would become available. There is still a good selection and I love the option of sampling a book before buying. Thanks Amazon. Keep up the good work.
5,"Head of Global Solutions Laboratory, SK Telecom","I wish to commend the team who created Kindle on a very impressive product. This is the first time when a product has compelled me to respond with a feedback although I've purchased many exceptional products before. It is a brilliant stroke of genius and makes perfect sense for Amazon. I ordered Kindle with some skepticism, thinking that I will most likely discard it later, but now I'm convinced that I will get most of my books through it. I am discovering Kindle is causing me to buy books that I would not have purchased if I did not have it, and even books that I already own in paper. I've looked at Sony's eBook and it completely misses the mark that Kindle hit perfectly. This is truly an inspire product, executed exquisitely. Congratulations to the team."
5,Kindle makes me a better reader.,"I must admit, at first it took me a little time to figure it out. Now I take it with me and whenever I have the time, I read. It would be nice to have a light with it."
5,Kindle Reader,"I love my Kindle! The print is clearer than I thought it would be and it's so easy to read. You can change the font sizes at anytime. Downloading books is so easy and you don't even have to be connected to a PC. The Kindle books you download to read are also more cost effective than books for other readers. Books on the best seller list for the Kindle sell for $9.99 and the prices goes down from there. The books can be deleted from the Kindle but are always available on your Amazon account so if you want to re-read, just download it again for no additional charge. You can also have the books dowloaded onto your PC and then use the UB cable to upload onto your Kindle. The Kindle can hold 200 books without a memory card but can hold so much more with the card.Another great thing is, you don't have to worry about books piling up and trees getting cut down when you use a Kindle."
3,Visually Impared Reader,Needs a larger print font selection and the list of books and magazines is too limited. Otherwise a very useful gizmo.
4,Great but needs a little refinement,"I bought this for my father who is sight impaired. I got a chance to check it out first. The scroll indicator on the side is silver. This color against the white casing is not enought contrast to be user friendly, especially if one's eyesight is not great. The feature set of this device is incredible and well thought out. The Keys are a little too small and the home key need to be more prominent. In the end the Largest font offered was too small for my father to read and I ended up retuning the unit. I am waiting to see what future Kindles will incorporate. I think keeping the older population in mind will make this an even greater success."
3,"Fantastic, but a little too pricey....","Honestly, This thing looks like a dream come true... especially the subscriptions. It would be a lifesaver in airports or on planes, and I really like the reduced prices for books and magazines.But, the price!!! Seriously, why not just lower the price a bit and then get your returns off of the sales? Or perhaps Amazon is losing money off of the e-book sales already?Barring a sudden onset of consumer lust, I will definitely not buy this thing until it hits 200 or 250..."
1,Cheated by Amazon,I was cheated by Amazon.com I bought the reader with my international credit card and int. address they gave me no problems there but when I received it and tried to download e-books off the site they said that because of int. laws and rights I couldn't download the e-books! and no other e-books can be read on this stupid device!I've been had!Lorenzo
3,Kindle in the dark,The kindle needs a backlight. It also needs to tell you the page number you are on. These are 2 important features that are lacking.
1,No backlight?,"Can someone please explain why something this expensive doesn't have a backlight to read at night? So much for reading in bed or on a plane without having to have a light source. I plan on returning mine. Some of you ""greatest thing since sliced bread"" people need to get a life when commenting on negative reviews. I hate to tell you but it does have shortfalls!!"
5,Kindle saved my sanity!,"I was losing my sanity in the high tech computer, cell phone, PDA, email, gadget world that kept me in bondage to the demands of the outside world. The Kindle lead me gently back into the world of books--via technology that doesn't feel so cold, intrusive, and inpersonal. I feel much calmer with the reconnection with books and reading that I grew up with. I appreciate the economic savings of the Kindle books themselves and the convenience to carry so many books with me at one time. It is light weight--especially important to someone with back pain--and I can carry enough books to suit whatever mood I might be in. It is also fantastic that you can turn any book into a large print book! Thank you, Amazon, for creating this device! I have used eBooks on my laptop, desk top, and PDA before but nothing compares with this!"
5,I like my Kindle,"Three years ago I had eye problems that made it impossible to read books and magazines. Print was too small without use of a magnifying glass. I dropped all my magazine subscriptions and finally had to give away my unread books. Then I read about the Amazon Kindle on my computer. After researching on my computer and reading reviews, I ordered one. I love it! Now I can read comfortably again. I have subscribed to Time magazine and receive it before it hits the news stands!! My only problem is I am ordering too many books!"
5,Reading Has Never Been So Easy,"I love Kindling. I find myself reading every chance I get. It is so easy to get the latest books. While watching a TV program that featured an author and his book, I picked up my Kindle and had the book in 10 seconds. The only downside is now I don't think I will ever be caught up with all the books I want to read. I can't wait to travel with it."
3,Amazon Price Increase on every item !! I am glad I quit Amazon.com for purchases ..,what's up with Amazon now ?. Trying to make tooo much profit in bad economy with bumping up prices on every item by 15-25% and the reducing by 1% ?. I am glad I don't purchase here without checking other sites.Make sure you check other sites like new egg or cos co before purchasing here. I am findind better deals out of amazon for sure.
2,Price is too high and that is what matters.Not the stuff,"First look - GoodSecond look @Features - hmmThird look @Price - OH NO!!!Yes, In this economy, this price is tooo high. Bring it down to 250/- and there will be lot of Customers in line.Give another option for non-wireless device for 180/- or 200/-.So.. Ultimately, i am waiting for Amazon's competitor to get me a similar product for teh same price or have amazon sell me at the price that is demanding. Whichever comes first!!!"
3,Problem with screen,"Unfortunately I'm going to return this. I love everything about it except for the screen. I am used to reading books with a white background and even my computer screen has a white background for reading. This has a grey background. My eyes started hurting right away. I kept trying to find a room with more light (although the light reflects into the screen and you have to find the right way to hold it so that it won't do this). No matter how much light there was, it didn't help. I called them and it cannot be made any lighter. I don't understand why they did this when they were trying to emulate a book. Why isn't the screen white? Maybe I am the only one, but just be aware of this before you buy one. By the way, I also asked my husband to view it and he agreed with me, there just isn't enough contrast to read it comfortably."
4,The Kindle,The Kindle is as advertised. It quickly downloads your selections. Selection of books and other material is extensive. Its operation is straightforward and intuitive.The screen is impressive and can be read even in bright sunlight. The battery seems to be up to the job. One issue is that our first download came through incompletely. The second one I tried was complete and no problem. Our house needs two Kindles so my wife and I can read at the same time.
4,Love it! (Hubby found a great solution to the cover issue!),"So far, I'm really enjoying the Kindle. (I've had it for 2 hours) It's very easy to read and ordering and downloading a book was a snap. From previous reviews, I expected the download process to be more instant than it actually was. It was more like a 5 minute wait. That's really not bad, considering I wait about 45 minutes for a movie download from iTunes. Also from previous reviews, I knew the included cover was not going to work that well. I used the elastic thing to hold the Kindle in place, but found it annoying; especially since it covered the track wheel. My husband came to the rescue. He attached the adhesive backed velcro circles to the back of kindle and to the inside of the cover. It holds it in place perfectly!"
5,WOW,"If you frequently eat alone in restaurants, this Kindle is for you!! I don't feel so uncomfortable and all alone as long as I have my Kindle in my purse! I have a choice of all my books consolidated in one little Kindle!! I love it."
1,A BIG disappointment,I bought a kindle and anxiously awaited its arrival and then to my great disappointment....it was just not for me. I found the lag between page turns distracting and frustrating during reading. It did not download purchased items within minutes .... or even hours... I finally had to use the usb cord hooked to my laptop to download the books i purchased. Also there was no light for night reading.....I enjoy reading in bed long after my husband has gone to sleep and don't like to be rude by leaving a bedside lamp on. Kindle may have its big fan but as an avid reader it did not meet my needs at all.
1,Not open?,"Amazon has a lot of books. It doesn't have every book. If I have a pdf, a txt, something, anything, I want to be able to read it on my book reader. If I used Kindle, would I have to have two readers? one for amazon stuff and one for everything else? I don't understand - I'm paying 400$ for a book reader, why can't I read my books on it?"
1,Hello 1983!,"If I was wearing checkered Vans, listening to Huey Lewis and watching Fast Times...there is an outside chance that I might have been interested in this. I've used e-ink displays while living in Japan; other than good contrast, I don't see any point in getting this. Get an old PDA and upload a few e-books...don't waste your money on ancient technology rehashed as something ""new and fantastic!"". This or an iPhone, iPod Touch or even a cheap laptop...no contest. If you want to read a book...GET A BOOK!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased a Kindle for my daughter for her birthday. The Kindle was on backorder for 2 months, when it did arrived the screen was cracked in half. Amazon gave me a hard time in returning it for another one and it was clearly defective. I wish I would have bought a different e-reader for her."
1,Far too delicate,"Don't believe that video where they show the Kindle being dropped and all is okay. I dropped mine about 2' onto a carpet and now I have a broken Kindle. It is as if the printer cartridge exploded. Customer Service to Kindle says 'sorry', not under warranty as I broke it. That's fine... I would pay to have it fixed as it was my fault. However, they say they do not offer any repair for Kindles at this time and provide a link for buying a new Kindle.Wrap it in bubble paper, people.."
1,Ah yes. Pay to not own. The economics of the 21t century,"I was first turned cold on Kindle when I learned I couldn't buy one from Australia. This may have changed but the business model hasn't. Once I learned that I could never truly own the works I bought for Kindle (thank you Mr Orwell for the delightfully apropos demonstration), Kindle was off my list forever."
5,Amazon Owes Me,"I bought my Kindle about a month ago. I was visiting my sister in Florida and I happened to show her my bookmarked Kindle page. She was so impressed, she said, ""You should buy it!"" and that's all I needed to take the plunge. The danger of being an Amazon Prime member and having 1-Click purchasing turned on was readily apparent a click later when a Kindle was on its way to my home in NY.Last week I was on my first trip with the Kindle. In airports, on planes, in waiting rooms, and at park benches, strangers approached me after watching my reading activities. A mother with two children who are voracious readers informed me that she had just found their Christmas presents. A soldier on furlough from Iraq thought he might wait until his release in 3 months to purchase it, but wasn't sure he could wait that long. And on and on...The biggest selling points: the screen, the ability to INCREASE font size, and the dictionary look-up feature."
5,The Kindle is Dynamite!,"The Kindle is a wonderful device! It is easy to hold, carry, and read. For medical reasons I had been able to read only at a table, and I could not, and cannot, read heavy books. My Kindle gets around all these obstacles. The ability to change type size is a great help and the capacity to look up definitions of words as you read is terrific.And I love getting the NY Times on my Kindle after I turn it on and while I am pouring my morning coffee. The criticisms of others who say it is too easy to go to the next page when you aren't ready to do so are correct. But it is easy to learn to hold the Kindle away from that lever. Others have found the cover clumsy to use. I find it a sturdy protector of the Kindle.You will love your Kindle!"
2,wow to the price....,"OK, I have to admit this is a great idea and all. But $400 dollars? honestly is not a very smart way to sell this. Amazon should try to sell it cheap and make money off the services. I will pay at most $100 for this unit. The technology of this thing is not worth $400....(for that price is a iphone or a very decent GPS)"
3,good but needs improvement,"With great anticipation, I received my Kindle. It is light, compact and very readable. This new e-ink is pretty good. The wireless connection is included with the purchase and I applaud that. Everyting was made easy. Except one thing.The ""next page"" and ""previous page"" buttons are far TOO LARGE. I accidently hit them because there isn't enough room to hold the Kindle in my hands without bumping them. This is esp'ly true when you turn it on and off. The on/off button is on the back, so when you flip it over you inevitably hit the ""next page"" button. While I love the Kindle I wish I had waited for the next generation model so these important problems were fixed. Good product, but wait to purchase!"
2,Too expensive! Please consider $20/month * 24 month subscription model,"Kindle 1.0 (=$399) is too expensive.Please change it to subscription model like cell phone plan.e.g. $20/month * 24-month contract commitment = $480which includes 10 eBooks to be downloaded.If you change it to subscription plan,my wife may let me get it.Or i may wait until Apple provides something similar..."
3,"Good idea, not color and the price is out of control","dear amazon,1.product design should be by apple, they know what they are doing.2.color screen3.price$200.00 max4.even better make it $75.00 and sell a zillion of them and start a revolution"
1,So 1980's!,"$400 for grayscale? And just 4-level grayscale at that? I guess this will not handle any books with color images, or even the color book covers! And not handle any full grayscale photographs. I was back at this resolution in 1984, with my first Macintosh Plus computer. POOR showing, Amazon. I'm waiting for the soon-to-be-announced FULL COLOR handheld by APPLE. Even the iPhone blows away this hideous Amazon contraption."
3,Textbooks not availble,"I do not have a Kindle, however i am extremely interested. I found most of what I wanted on the available books for Kindle. However what i am REALLY interested in is my next three years of college and getting my textbooks on a portable device. I have a bad back and can't carry my textbooks to class this would be a perfect solution and would pay for itself in one semester with the inflated price of hardcover textbooks."
1,I returned it!,"I was excited to receive my Kindle. Being able to browse, download samples and receive purchase immediately is great. I was disappointed to learn that I couldn't load any ebooks from my computer, and had to pay for translation services and download my personal documents through Amazon. I may be a klutz, but I found the device too hard to handle. I couldn't turn it on without losing the cover, I flipped pages trying to put the cover back and everytime I had to handle it, and I found I could read a page much faster than it would turn a page, which became frustrating. I wish I had a paper copy of the book I downloaded, because now it is gone."
1,Watch your wireless areas of coverage,"Having several wireless/cell providers in our area, we never thought to check the ""coverage area"" of the provider of wireless services for the Kindle. We could not download from our home 2 miles from town, nor in town, was it a strong signal. So, before buying check that out."
2,Difficult to handle,Kindle keeps falling out of the leather cover. Why bother with cover? Not enough room on face of Kindle to hold without accidently touching the Next or Back page button. Have had hand cramps trying to be careful where my fingers were placed. With a paper book I could at least put my thumb between pages to hold the book securely.
4,Kindel,Had to return item as we live in Canada. Unable to access downloads automatically. Required credit card account in USA (don't have.)Very disappointed as it would have been very easy to use and we were very excited.
4,This thing is awesome!,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas - but I opened it as soon as it came - and I love it! I have read 6 books in the last 2 weeks and I take it with me everywhere. Anytime someone tells me about a great book they've read - I download the free sample no matter where i am - getting a hair cut, Dr's office, supermarket - wherever. It was very easy to learn to use - even my kids are amazed at how quickly I mastered it! My only complaint is that the design could be tweaked a little. When I hold it - I sometimes turn the page without meaning to. But I am adapting - and I realy do love my Kindle. It is the most practical, useful and fun electronic devise I have ever owned."
3,Book Suggestions,"I love the idea of the Kindle and can't wait to get one. I think it'll be great for traveling; you can store lots of books into the small Kindle instead of taking up lots of space in your luggage for many books. What about the many books people read daily? The Bible? Meditation books? Alcoholics Anonymous? It would be super if you could get everybody's versions of the Bible as well as the Big Book of AA. This way, I'd have the Kindle with me 24/7. Let me know when you can do this, then I'll get a Kindle."
2,completely wrongheaded concept,"Ebooks are the wave of the future. I'm glad to see Amazon's reader if only because it will get people used to ebooks. But this product has a few wrong-headed concepts. First, the price is ridiculous. For $399 you can get a Treo 680, load hundreds of ebooks onto a SDHC card, and also use it as a computer, email client, game player, PDA, and MP3 player. PLUS, and this is critical--the 680 is small enough to hold in one hand comfortably, and to have on you all the time. Portability is a key to an ebook reader IMHO. A 680 is just big enough--and not too small. You can read it easily, but you can always have it with you. You're sitting someplace and bored--pull it out and read a chapter. The last thing you need is another device to pack or carry, however. If you want an ebook reader--get a multi-purpose device that can you put in your pocket."
1,Don't want the EVDO. Just let me add my own stuff...,"First it's 400 bucks... way too much...But, it has the free internet connection, great? right? but you gotta use it to buy from AMAZON and AMAZON only. Wanna load up your own file? pay up $0.10 per pop. why?Frankly, I don't want the EV-DO connection. I'll just add the content by connecting to my PC, like I do with iPod. Just let me add my own text, doc, pdf to the device. Just as iTunes, lets me add my own DRM free mp3 files to my device, let me do the same with my doc and pdf.This could have been so much more than what it is...Wonderful first generation hardware pooly executed at it's delivery and marketing.Oh.. one more thing....If you give away digital copy of the kindle book with a print copy, that will really sweeten the book buying from AMAZON over any other places, say... Barns and Noble. But .... you guys will never see the point of what consumers see....so sad.."
3,Poor physical design,"How can Amazon have bungled the physical design so badly? Would it be so difficult to round the bottom corners just a little so they don't dig into your hands? I can't figure out how to pick this thing up without turning the page! Without any formidable competition, Amazon should have taken the time to get this device right. But since electronic ink is so great (no credit to Amazon), and a reasonable amount of content now exists, I will tolerate this contraption."
2,Do not buy if you live in Canada,"A girlfriend of mine had this item shipped to a friend in the States, brought it back to Canada, and then realized she couldn't download any books unless she could pay with a US credit card. (Oddly enough, they were able to detect that her credit card came from Canada)So, she sadly had to ship it back to the States, and then her friend had to ship it back to Amazon.I'm not sure what the logistics are or why you're not able to use this item in Canada, but Amazon is just shooting themselves in the foot by limiting their customers to just the US.Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, does it?"
2,Brilliant! -- And way too expensive,"This is the way I always thought we would be reading books and newspapers in the 21st century.But -- huge but -- if you're going to make money from subscriptions and purchases it won't work if you also have such a jacked up price for the unit. Either everything is free forever (yeah right) and you make $400 from the hardware, or you go smart, make the unity $49 and then make the money from the software. Which is the way to go.As much as this fulfils a dream of mine, this unit -- I don't care if I wait until 2020, but I will not buy one until it becomes affordable."
3,Ooops-Didn't Mean To Turn The Bleeping Page!!!,"Suuuuch a great concept-fast downloads, lots of availble titles. But the ambidexterous thingy is soooo off-putting. Can't begin to tell you how often I've accidentally turned one or several pages just by holding the Kindle or resting it on the bed. Very frustrating and not fixable by a software upgrade. It's a basic design flaw-one that I am finding is pretty hard to live with for the asking price of $359.00."
3,I just got my awated Kindle.,"It is confusng at first and I guess I will eventually figure out where are all the bells are but whereas the book cover is good to protect it, when closed and not in use, it falls off durng readng.The large button to turn the page it great if you are a speed reader ---- I keep accidently hitting it when I attempt to hold the thing to read the page (where do you hold onto it, in your palm?--- that is tiring).I am reading a series of books by one author. Who ever heard of being able to purchase 5 out of six books. Book 1 to 3 and #5 and six are kindle available. Number 4 is not kindle available.This is all I can complain about but it is only day one. Can you figure a new design so you can easily hold the book without constantly hitting a turn page button?"
3,connectivity problem,"The product is a fantastic concept. It does not work everywhere. I live 5 miles outside city limits and could not connect to server-ever.I tried 2 different Kendles, thinking there was a problem with the firt one. It does not work as well as your cell phone. If I could have connected, it would have been a great new way to read."
5,I LUV MY KINDLE!!!,"My Kindle arrived yesterday, I was so excited, I got started right away, and last night, the tv wasn't even on because I was reading my Kindle. This device is perfect and I love it. It's comfortable to hold, I love the dictionary, I love when I put the Kindle to sleep and I get a very cool and different picture on my Kindle.I'm addicted.Here's my problem, I don't want to go back to a traditional book at this time. I wish there was a way a person who has purchased many books from amazon to somehow for a minimal price be allowed to download those books he or she purchases on a kindle!!!I can only suggest! And hope Amazon is listening.I can't imagine not reading without this clever little gadget!Go buy a Kindle, let Santa bring it to you!"
4,"I Love My Kindle, But","Great little gadget. Can't be beat when traveling or waiting around in a dentist or Dr.s office.Did not give it 5 stars because I find the design lacking, e.g. difficult not to hit the back key or next page key when moving the object quickly from one hand to another or trying to just turn it off quickly. For me, a better design would have been smaller page keys that are both the same size and the back key above the previous page key.I also am having trouble with not having a numbered page. I cannot easily see the substitute for page numbers quickly. I have to go get my glasses for that. Not much point in being able to enlarge the text if other options are too small."
5,Can't live without it!,I absolutely love the kindle! The battery life is so long and the quality is awesome!
5,Love my Kindle,"I read all the time but I am also a single mother so I don't have all the time to hunt around bookstores for new books. With this I can find new books while I'm at work, or doing homework. Whatever. So now I am reading books I would never have had the time to find before. It's great I am thoroughly impressed."
2,Kindle isn't quite there yet,"This thing needs a back-light!!! You can't read in bed without a book light. which is silly considering how much it costs. It also needs a color screen for viewing book cover, illustrations, and web pages. I also found it hard to hold upright without hitting the right-page button. I returned mine and will wait for the second generation Kindle to hopefully correct these simple, but glaring issues."
4,Doesn't work everywhere.,"I bought this as a gift for my husband because the promotion said you could connect everywhere. What they don't tell you is that it doesn't connect in all areas of the country. You have to have Sprint available. After going out of our state, we were finally able to get it to work and it worked well. We now have to save it until we leave home. This information should have been available before purchase."
4,Its a great product But it's just way too over priced.,It is a great product i love it. but it is still priced for the people who feel they just gotta have the latest tech.I can't believe it cost them anywhere near $350 to make the thing. Sorry but table pc's with touch screens now only cost on the low side $600. this needs to be priced around $150 or less.
2,"hated it, now I think I'll tolerate it.","With all of the recent reports of the entertainment industry finally starting to ""get"" that DRM is not worth the cost and a general move (or at least discussion) towards openness, Amazon's announcement of drm-infested product in a closed system kinda ticked me off. Well, to be honest, I'm an anti-drm zealot so I was actually pretty mad. But I've had a bit of time to cool down and I actually think this is a bad product and service that will beget better products and services in the not too distant future. The device will come down in price. The DRM will be hacked so books can be used on other devices. The device will be improved. People will start to prefer ebooks to physical books and publishers will begin to oblige readers. So, while I won't be buying Kindle 1.0, I will very likely buy 1.5 or a cheap(er) knockoff."
3,Instruction manual needs to be more in depth,"I am not one of those people who learn well by reading a computer. So I need more how to user friendly instructions, user manual. I atill can't figure out how to get my old books to storage.Other than that it works great once I got my second one.Cindy Calligan"
2,"so promising, yet...","I bought the Kindle with such high hopes and to a certain extent, it has delivered. But its performance has been VERY uneven. A few points for you who are considering it:1. screen should be paper white, but is in fact gray, and brightness isn't adjustable. Hard to see except in bright reading light.2. Reception on the Whispernet (Amazon's propietary wi-fi delivery system) VERY spotty. I get the NY Times delivered daily (supposedly) to the Kindle, and often it doesn't come either cause I'm in a dead spot (like all of Western Massachusetts) or for no good reason even when I'm in NY.3. It freezes up even when the battery is still over half charged and nothing can be done to reset it. VERY FRUSTRATING.Happy to be an early adopter, and the fact that I travel a lot makes Kindle very convenient. But there are still MANY kinks to iron out."
1,Kindle-a disaster!,"I bought a Kindle in March 2008 and it worked reasonably well. However, the battery failed in September 2008 and I haven't been able to get a replacemet battery. Web blogs indicate that this is a widespread problem, but Amazon hasn't solved it. No other supplier has any batteries. So, I have an expensive device that doesn't work. I view this as a disaster. I marked this product one star only because I couldn't mark it zero stars. Do not buy this junk!"
3,Proprietary format,"The show-stopper for me so far on both the Kindle and the Sony reader is the proprietary format for content. I've been looking for a nicely designed reader for years, but honestly, I simply won't consider owning one as long as it locks me into a proprietary format. That limits the amount of content, insures obsolescence, and increases cost.The manufacturers need to get over the desire to totally own revenue stream for content forever. You guys want eReaders to succeed? Get a common format."
1,No signal in my area - Had to return it.,"Apparently I live too far out in the country to be able to use the Kindle. I had to drive 13 miles from my home to even get a weak signal. I bought the product so that I could buy books from home, at my leisure, but if I have to get in the car and drive over 13 miles just to download a book, it really isn't worth it. I returned it 2 days after I got it. I was very disappointed because I am an avid reader and thought this product would be perfect for me."
5,just lovin' it!,"This device might have some flaws but I just love it! It is exactly what it claims to be, not trying to be a 100% alternative to print media but definetely a superb add-on for people who love reading while traveling and appreciate access to magazines and newspapers. I personally also use the international papers offered and am hoping for more products on the Kindle-list in foreign languages. Being able to use the Whispernet for shopping or research whereever I am and for free is also a great asset which I wouldn't want to miss anymore."
3,Kindle,"The two major reasons I can't enjoy the Kindle as often as I'd like are: (1) it does not have backlighting for night and otherwise dimly lit environments ; (2) it is difficult to hold due to minimal space for hands/fingers, and allows little flexibility for re-positioning without accidently pressing a function."
2,Kindle,"I love it! My only problem is whenever I touch it, I change the page. It would be helpful to have more space at the top and sides where you can handle it without touching any buttons."
2,I don't have this or have I seen it in real life but my initial reaction is....,It looks like a calculator from the 80's.....Texas Instruments maybe? Consult Apple(tm) about product design.
2,San Francisco Chronicle Subscription Download out of town,"I am currently trying out the SF Chronicle subscription. I was at Salt Lake City yesterday thinking that I can now read my local paper when I am out of town on business. Salt Lake City (downtown) does not have Wireless signal at all. It's hard for me to believe. I don't know maybe it's just yesterday. When I got to the SLC airport at 7pm returning to Oakland, the wireless signal was on and I can access the store, but the Wednesday Chronicle was still not downloaded. When I got home finally, I turn on the wireless, the paper was immediately downloaded. Anyone has been able to download their paper out of town?"
3,Is this for U.S only?,"Not a review but a question. I have had a read through all the information here, but can't see anything about International users. Can anyone tell me if I could use this in Australia? Are there any Australian buyers who can give me any information as to additional fees that I might have to pay if i were to purchase a kindle?"
1,Beware of lack of available product.,Amazon will not tell you that they are having inventory issues until after they take your money. I would also recommend using upgrade shipping as Amazon feels the United States Postal Service is perfectly suited to deliver a $350.00 electronic device. I would love to rate the performance of the Kindle if Amazon could ever tell me the estimated availability and shipping date. If this is a gift be sure to order a month in advance or they will not hit the date. In addition they give the USPS a five day window beyond the estimated date to find and or try to deliver the item. Very disappointed with the execution after payment especially during this period in our economy - one would think Amazon would have their act together when people are willing to spend $350.00 on a product.
1,I'll skip this,I would assume that the price is so high because Amazon is paying for the evdo service. I honest don't mind syncing a kindle to computer and I would never pay more than $100 for something I would only read on. Great it has no glareand it makes getting the books easy but no thanks.
1,Terrible,"Looks terrible and unintuitive, sony's version are much slicker, but far from perfect as well."
5,A Library at my fingertips!,"The Kindle I recently received is absolutely a truly wonderful gift from my family. I love to read, yet our local library is small so book choices are limited. Our home is also small so purchasing books becomes problematic in terms of space issues. The Kindle is just what we needed-- a way to have interesting, timely books and no problems with storing them. The Kindle suits my needs very well!!"
