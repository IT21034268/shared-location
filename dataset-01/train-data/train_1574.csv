5,Great !,"If I say that I love this CD, it's clearly an understatement. I think it is his masterpiece, although comparing Mark's CDs is always so complicated beacause they're so different and beautiful.What I think is too bad, however, is how people put bad commentaries about this, thinking at first that they'll get a Dire Strait album and then being disappointed about it being an MK CD. It's been years now, and Dire Strait is over, just please get over it and stop comparing MK's work to his earlier work, there's nothing to compare, it is TOTALLY different, and as I say, for the best ! This album is here to prove it."
3,Not bad but.....,"This is an ok early solo (post Dire Straits release by one of the most individual guitarists of our time. Has a few good tunes all well played as you'd expect but doesn't really compare to the best of his later stuff. Still, not the worst cd you will ever own!"
5,Mark sounds just like Dire Staits (he's from that band),"great CD and i never realized how much Kopfler contributed to the band Dire Straits until i heard his voice and guitar riffs. wonderfully refreshing in this day of recycled music. all original and all terrific songs.CD as described by seller, and it got to me quickly - nice transaction!"
4,"Several Gems, Hidden And Otherwise","For MK fans familiar with his ""Columbus Period"" (read: discovering American music), ""STP"" will rank as one of the more accessible editions of that campaign.For those who still associate him exclusively with the ""Sultans Of Swing"", or, God forbid, ""Money For Nothing"" Dire Straits years there will be some disconnect on first review.Regardless, this album will please most who are willing to give it a couple listens or more.Knopfler's singular quality is his fusing of top-notch professionalism, superior musicianship, and deft songwriting. His perfectionism both in the studio and on stage only add to the fan's experience. All of these traits are on display in abundance on STP.Though there are a couple ""radio-friendly"" tunes whose melodies will stick in your head all day, this album will reward those who put in the time to hunt for the hidden gems. They're in there, waiting, like so many of MK's best tunes over the years."
5,Song and Dance Man by Karen Ackerman,"This book is a great book. It is about a grandfather who dances and sing for his grandchildren up in the attic. The part I like the most is when the man dances really fast it makes music and when he spins and jumps up into the air.I would reommend this book, because it is a fun book to read."
3,Song And Dance Man,"I usally read dancing books all the time,and this time was not so bad.It wasn't the best book i read or it wasn't the worst.It was just all right. If you like to dance follow me.This books about a grandfather and some grandchildren who likes to shake their tail feathers. The grandchildren don't believe there grandpa can sing and dance ,but when he finds out his dancing shoes still fit it all breaks loose......"
1,BORING.... (yawn),"When I first starting reading Elizabeth Lowell, her characters were sexy and smoldering. Now she writes treatises on gem cutting, art collecting, etc. with a tiny bit of sexy and smoldering thrown in to the mix. Well, it's not enough for me or for many of her former fans (read the other reviews). Too bad - she used to be one of my favourites."
2,Irritatingly repetitive,"I just finished ""Die In Plain Sight"" and thought it was terrific! It was the first book I'd read by this author, and I was so excited to have found a new (for me) author. I was lucky enough to find ""The Color of Death"" at the library, but I was sorely disappointed. It seemed to me like the same book as ""Die In Plain Sight"", the characters just had different names. The male protagonists use the same term of endearment -""darling""- and the author keeps using the same annoying turn of phrase - ""his/her smile was all teeth"". And there was much more, as some of the previous reviewers have mentioned. Maybe I wouldn't have noticed all the similarities if I hadn't read these books so close together, but that's not really my fault is it?"
1,Quite painful,"I'm usually an Elizabeth Lowell fan, however this was a quite painful read. There was way too much dry textbook information about gems and sadly, the characters were flat."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I won't bore you with a synopsis of this book, since there are several before me, however, I will tell you it's one of the most annoying books I have ever read. The heroine is a cookie-cutter gorgeous, perfect, smart, sassy (oh come ON NOW, and she's single???)....if the author had spent as much time on character development as she did dwelling on the main character's hair clip (what was THAT all about?), I may have enjoyed this book. It just all seemed a little too familiar and neat for me. The romantic tension was predictable (I was screaming, ""Just do IT already), and the rogue cop schtick was very ""been there, done that"". I don't think I'll be combing the shelves for any more Elizabeth Lowell books."
4,Deadly Sapphires,"Kate Chandler cuts the ""Seven Sins"". Her half brother Lee Mandell, is suppose to deliver them in Florida. But he never shows up. Authorities beleive that him and his buxom girlfriend, pawn the sapphires and leaves the country. But there is one problem. Lee Mandell is gay. He's engaged to be married to Norm.Kate knows something terrible has happened to Lee. So when they close the case, she won't let it lie.At a gem show she sees one of the sapphires. She is able to switch a fake in it's place, to check it out. In the process of replacing the real stone for the fake. She is caught, by FBI agent Sam Groves. Kate gives him an alias.Sam does some investigating to find out that she has lied to him. He goes to see her. Confronts her.In the meantime, couriers and gem brokers have either been robbed or killed.Sam and Kate work together to find Lee's killer and the theif of the ""Seven Sins""."
1,the color of coincidence,Too many characters with implausible relationships and convienent coincidences.
2,Just OK,"This novel is not one of her best. I found the romance a little flat and got confused with all the FBI characters. I have to agree with other reviewers... ""What was up with Kate's hairclip?"""
4,Almost the Best,"I am a great fan of Elizabeth Lowell, and have read all of her books under each pseudonym. This is not her best effort, but is excellent in its own way. The plot details appear simple. Missing gems, people opposed to one another having to team up to solve the problem, a death threat, murders and, of course, romance and sex. A great formula done with polish, verve and a great twist at the end.Would I buy it? Yes. Would I keep it forever? No. While the book is fundamentally sound, I found it to be a bit slower reading than some of her other titles, particularly the Amber Beach series [Amber Beach, Pearl Cove, Jade Island and Ruby Bayou]. The main characters are well developed, and it is easy to understand why Sam's personality keeps him from being more successful in the FBI. The dialog is fresh and realistic, and the sex scenes are well done and just dreamy enough to make this a ""romance"" as well as a suspense story.Great read. Enjoy."
4,Another enjoyable read by one of the best.,I always enjoy and look forward to Ms. Lowell's books and this one is no exception. The ending leaves it open to the possibility of more to come and I hope to see more of Sam and Kate in the future.
2,too technical/ flat chemistry,"I think this author spends a little too much time educating the reader on the ins and outs of the jewelry trade than she does developing her characters, plot and definately the endings. I have found this to be true of several of her recent books. I really liked the Donovan family and the four books related to them, but since then, she has failed to pull me in with either character and especially with them together. In the Color of Death, I found myself skipping over pages and pages of tutorial about semi precious stones and the specifics of the cutting world and trade. Why do i need to know so much about the work? I am not planning to actually finish the novel and then go and perfectly cut a diamond or saffire. I thought the ending was flat and didn't answer all the questions brought up in the book. I think this will be my last Elizabeth Lowell book until she delves back into the Donovan family."
2,I was lost,"I've enjoyed the Donavan series that Elizabeth Lowell wrote. I must confess that on this book, I was completely lost with the characters. I found myself flipping back to see who the characters were and what their job was. The story line was good, the gem information was interesting and I enjoyed the relationship building between the two main characters. I was glad that I was not able to figure out who the killer was until the last few pages. The suspense was very good. I suggest to anyone reading this book to start a list of the characters and use that as a book mark."
1,Please don't waste you rmoney!,"My daughter really wanted this toy for her 5th birthday. Grandma bought it for her. It has been a major dissapointment. Everyone here at the party tried to get Angelica to work without much luck. It is very hard to use. We keep trying to press the compact and get Angelica to respond by the color showing up on her eyes or lips. It works maybe once every 50 times we try. Angelica is constantly singing. My daughter keeps crying for her to ""be quiet"". This toy will definately be ""lost"" in the next day or so!"
2,High Price - Minimal Play,"My 5.5 year old daughter received this from Santa 2005. After literally 2 minutes of play, she said ""this is boring, it doesn't do anything"". The price is high for $34.99. It comes with a pair of shoes & a comb. After changing the color on the eyelids & mouth a few times, that's it. The additional outfits are pricey at $9.99 each & hard to find. We returned this for Littlest Pet Shop. As others have said - the face does look weird."
1,needs more information,"this book is very good with the information, but it does NOT have any of the problems! Amazon should have made it very clear that one would have to buy the MyMathLab to get problems for homework. Very unhappy about what I got from the information provided!"
3,Ok,"This book was required for my math instruction, and as several readers have mentioned before, I am glad that the instructor was an excellent teacher the book by itself is no use. Unless you understand math to begin with.However used with an excellent instructor it becomes a useful tool."
1,waste of $ and time,"This book was the required book for my college class. It is nothing short of pure torture. Thank God my professor is excellent!! The examples in this book are very hard to interpret and the problems are not much good either. Also, the answers to the chapter problems in the back of the book contain only the odd-numbered problems. Good luck!"
2,Intermediate Algebra,"Assignments in book was missing in all chapters.It was shipped in time. The book was not complete, it had no assignments in each chapter."
2,Not What It Looks Like,"This product is not what it looks like. In the online ordering process, it was not mentioned anywhere that you must also purchase MyMathLab seperately. When I recieved this book, I discovered that the format of the book did NOT include any of the chapter exercises. Which obviously is important and necessary for any student ordering a textbook. So buyer beware. This book does not include everything."
2,A Waste of Money and Time,"This book may give clear solutions for the example problems, but the actual study problems are unclear and do not follow the examples very closely. I have spent more time attempting to figure out how to set up problems in homework assignments and searching for the 'solutions' that are needed to solve the exercises than I have actually spent doing the math.This book not only frustrated me, but my tutor as well. The optional ""solutions"" book is even worse; it lists the chapters, but not the sections or page numbers.For review, it probably is not a bad book. It's very condensed. For someone who has not been introduced to the concepts in the book prior to this book, expect to have a LOT of time on your hands if you want to work through this book."
1,Not Happy,I was not happy with the book that I recieved. It was not the same as the picture or the description. I contacted the seller to ask why that was and they never got back to me. I came in a three ring binder with pages coming out. I had to purchase another copy of the book because it was so far off from what I needed. I was not happy.
1,PRODUCT HAS NOT YET ARRIVED,PLEASE ADVISE. WHEN DID THIS ITEM SHIP? IT HAS NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED.VIVIAN
2,The casting alone would have helped,"The problem here is too much basis in the SCTV family of films. The viewer in my experience tends to take films that the producers of a TV series do and associate them with that point of origin, the way any David Spade, Wil Ferrell or Mike Myers and Dana Carvey vehicle is seen as an SNL big-screen spinoff. Also if they'd waited a few years until the turn of the new century brought us such classics as the Flintstones feature starring John Goodman, they would have benefitted from the creation of that new sub-genre; live action movies based on animated cartoons. And the choices for the starring roles might have been more believable. Like Cher as Natasha (she already has the looks and the voice, all she would have had to do is learn the East Bloc accent). And maybe Danny DeVito as Boris."
3,"Shakespeare is always a 5 star, However Print is Small & Smudged","Who is to judge Shakespeare? Here all I can question is the medium. I purchased this book expecting normal sized print as it is a dimensionally larger than average sized paperback. Ironically however, the print in this edition is rather smallish, compressed, and often smudged throughout the book.If want want a scholarly text this is a good one. However, if you wear reading glasses and simply want to read Shakespeare's Sonnets in a relaxed way without squinting, you may want to look elsewhere."
1,Minus 10 Degrees in Chicago,"Gee...must be global warming! My water pipes frozen for the first time in 22 years where I live in California, gee...must be global warming!Must be the carbon monoxide coming from the tailpipe of my S.U.V. that Al Gore is telling me is poisioning and warming the planet...wait, let me scrape the ice off my windshield. I just hate global warming!I'm not really sure, but when I walked outside today I thought the sky was actually closer to the earth. Must be global warming.I'm voting for Al Gore!"
1,Should be Free,"I don't think this movie is worth one dollar. It does have useful information, but if the intent is to help the people save the planet, then why not just give it away, and ask for donations.There are a lot of moments in this film that I thought were totally irrelevant, and focused on the life of Al Gore.I feel like I got tricked by all of the positive reviews into contributing to a campain for Al Gore.Don't pay for this film!"
3,The Message is Worth intrest and action,"However Al Gore (the savior of the human race) is the emperor of cheese balls. I cant believe he injected a bit of his weaselly political powting about his loss to the presidency. There was no need for that unless he had other motives other than to warn about this supposed impending catastrophe--mmm... say maybe a political agenda? FEAR! IS THE GOVERNMENT'S ULTIMATE WEAPON!--Ah ha, there is one for all the conspiracy theorist in the land. This is very important information and every one should take it seriously--even if it were true by a margin of .00000000001%, action should be taken by every person on the planet. But why Al Gore, why? I just cant seem to muster any crediblity that man may possess."
1,Global warming is the world's most overhyped news story,"I never believed the idea that the barbaric human race and it's primitive ""fossil fuels"" are 100% responsible for raising the planet's temperature. The global warming fanatics are simply taking an ancient natural phenominon and blowing it totally out of proportion. Planet Earth has been going through natural cycles of both global warming and global cooling ever since the begining of time. The planet's climate has little to nothing to do with humanity and it's use of oil or coal. The industrial revolution is only a couple hundred years ago, the blink of an eye in natural history. Before you decide that the human race is ""destroying the earth"", do some historical research. If you have half a brain you'll forget all about Al ""please vote for me in 08"" Gore and never believe in man made global warming again!"
1,Correlation is not truth. Thank God this man isn't President.,"Despite having an hour and a half for his ""slideshow,"" Gore never presents any evidence that higher levels of CO2 are causing global temperatures to rise, glaciers to melt,etc. Al makes the claims, based entirely on inferences, and shame on everyone who dares to ask questions. What mechanism causes this? No explanation is offered. Anyone who has taken a course in statistics can see through this. As a bonus, the special feature, in which Gore attempts to explain away the complete lack of anticipated hurricanes in 2006, is a complete insult to your intelligence."
3,Entertaining Comedy,"I bought this because it looked cool, and I love documentary type movies. This is very like Leonard Nimoy's ""In Search Of"". You know, total hypothesis like bigfoot, ice age, aliens etc. Fun movie, Al Gore needs you to buy this movie so he can continue to pollute the world in his private jets and use 30 times the electricity of a normal American while relaxing in his mansion."
5,Love of Planet,"Because of this film, I see Al Gore as a caring, intelligent, compassionate and humble man. For personal, political reasons I was happy he lost the election, and I was wrong about him. I would vote for him today, but I am still happy he lost. Were he President he would not have produced this film to awaken us to the transformational opportunity and imperative we have before us: the quality of our childrens' lives and the survival of our species and this planet. Don't watch this because you are a Democrat, and don't not watch it because you are a Republican. Watch it becuase you care. Watch it to learn how man can undo what man has wrought."
5,How have we been so blind?,"This movie grabbed our attention right from the start, with its well-documented statistics and graphic illustrations of the deterioration of our planet. The saddest moments are the ones dealing with the destruction of habitat for many of our wonderful wild creatures, who depend on us for caring for their environment. We must do better!"
5,How come nothing related to the Meat Industry was mentioned?,"I've read countless times again and again how much the Meat Industry is contributing to Global Warming - so much that by simply ""opting out"" of entire spectrum & choosing to lead a plant based diet - can reduce green house gas emissions so vastly that it is far greater than any other of these idealism's that Gore even mentions. Was it too perplexing for this man to even bring up such a simple and prevalent idea, or is he also guilty of being oblivious to the on-sight crisis at hand?"
5,"Nay-sayers, lighten up!","A lot of people say that Al Gore's crusade against global warming is all wrong. Also, that this is a film promoting Al Gore. I disagree. Mr. Gore's passion for saving the planet is not to be taken lightly, and, whether you believe it or not, it's a valid theory to be taken seriously. Mr. Gore was never boring in his quest, or his exposition of the material at hand. I was amazed, and often amused, at Mr. Gore's handling of the material. The DVD extras are insightful. And, yes, Mr. Gore's losing that election was, indeed, an inconvenient truth. UPDATE: Mr. Gore just won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Apparently, someone is listening, though maybe not the ones who make decisions..."
5,Important information for all living beings,"An [...] Best DVDs of 2006 selection? And well it should be! This is a must see for every sentient being on the planet.Al Gore has taken the scientific information on global warming and distilled it into an easily understandable presentation for the rest of us.I recommend that you watch it, share it and think about what you can do to make a difference."
1,Scare Tactics,"This is a pretty good fantasy. However, the animatronic lead character was not very lifelike and far from convincing. Nice bit of propaganda, not much else. The best part was the crying over the lost election. I am guessing that was supposed to be touching. And I did watch it. God Bless You."
1,Inconvenient waste of time,"What a hypocrite! The limousine liberal Gore lectures on the dangers of global warming, yet he is seen frequently in the video riding in the back seat of a large sedan rather than in a Hybrid. In one shot, he is boarding an empty, fuel thirsty Boeing 747. I guess it's OK for Gore emit vast amounts of Greenhouse gass since he is saving the world, but not for the common folk like me.The video does make a compelling argument. My issue is with the almost next President."
3,A Convenient Backdrop,"I don't have a beef with Al Gore's message. Rather, I wish I had been able to see his presentation from start to finish without the ""documentary"" injections to this film that seek to augment factual presentation with emotional string pulling.Emotional string pulling shouldn't be involved in a documentary about global warming; it breeds cynics. We need more facts (and there were a lot more that could have been presented) and fewer irrelevant side-stories meant to make the viewer go, ""oooo"" or ""awwww"".I suppose if you know someone who doesn't really care about global warming and has the attention span of a flea, this video could be a good launching point to get them thinking about the subject.If you're already thinking about the subject, skip this movie and do your own research online. Go to wikipedia and spend 15 minutes reading global warming articles and you'll know more than the people who watched this film."
1,Great movie to put you asleep.,This movie was very boring.Two hours of crying and lying over humans destroying the earth.Scientists have already said the sun is heating up and all the other planets in the solor system are also.So this movie would lke you to think what ever you do on this planet go back to living in the 1800's and buy a horse to ride to work.Come on people were not born yesterday.If you feed into this movie then you must not mind paying a person Cap-And-Trade money to make you feel you are not destroying the planet.This is the worse movie I have ever seen in my life.
2,Shocking What Gore Leaves Out,"Not a terrible ""documentary"" really...But I was blown away that Gore spent an hour and a half talking about the dangers of increased CO2 in the atmosphere, but barely talks about the main SOURCES of CO2 and other greenhouse gases around the world.He mentions burning coal in passing, but doesn't even touch on the fact that cattle farms around the world are ENORMOUS contributors of CO2 and methane (in fact, they are the source of 18% of all greenhouse gases). Cattle farms also have a huge impact on water quality world-wide.(Read the recent United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, if you want to learn more.)If Gore truly believed his own theories, he would be a militant vegan. And he certainly wouldn't fly in private planes or own 5 enormous homes.But Gore's not a vegan. He wants to be president. That means winning votes in cattle country. The evironmental movement is just a stepping stone for him.Hypocrite!"
1,Waste of money - contradicts itself,"This was a horrible film to use if your trying to help the environment. the facts were seriously off and easily checked. The graph he uses to show major rises in carbon dioxide levels were most extreme in our very far past, but he overlooks that and says it is now happening. Maybe he had good intentions so I'll give him one star for that. The pretty scenaries and the stories of his youth were interesting for nostalgi, but I think Gore wasn't well prepared at all."
3,"I used to believe it, now I'm not sure.","This video made me believe in Global Warning.Update: Nov. 22, 2009. Within the last couple months new information about climate change as been published which contradicts the information in this video. Also, since 2001 the global temperature has actually been decreasing."
5,An Inconvenient Truth,"Excellently done, down to earth, realistic if not too conservative in it's predictions. I would wish that more of our politicians, here in Switzerland as well as in the US of A would pay more attention to our environment and would finally dare to set and enforce limits on our highway robers in usually dark business suits."
4,Demo verses Repub,"I consider this a must see to learn about climatic change. Of interest when I show this to Republicans they can't seem to see past Al Gore...therefore I believe it would be vitally important for a Republican to come out with the same critical message so that more Republicans could see past Gore and ""get"" the main message."
4,An Inconvenient Truth,I think that it was very informative and I love the visuals. I have shown this to several people and I am telling even more.
5,Bought this to share....,"I purchased this Dvd to loan to others who have not seen this very important presentation when it was in theaters. I found the update by Gore on what has been learned since the original filming to be very informative and chilling. I feel that everyone who hasn't seen this, needs to do so. It is that important!"
5,Hippy tree-hugger,"I am no tree hugger or hippie but this movie was interesting and it truly opened my eyes to a very real problem by making a strong case with indisputable evidence. Where I once had doubt about this issue I now want to spread the word, please see this movie, if for nothing else then watch it for the wow factor.UPDATE::(I'm afraid that my sarcasm didn't come out.. I guess that the title of the review wasn't enough)"
5,This film is an absolute must see!,"One might think a movie about global warming would be boring, but An Inconvenient Truth is quite the opposite. Al Gore does an incredible job presenting hard, indisputable evidence for global warming. He not only discusses the science behind it, he also discusses the ramifications it can have on our society if we do not act.I also liked how he tied in some personal information about his life. It gives the viewer a better sense of how pasionate Mr Gore really is about the environment. I would have liked to have seen a little more discussion about what we as citizens can do, but overall, a must-see, captivating film. After you see it, you won't be asking whether or not global warming is real, but rather you will be asking what we are doing to stop it.Also recommended: ""The Weather Makers"" by Tim Flannery"
2,"good subject, bad anchorman","I believe in the global warming, first of all. However, that's a very complex matter. The climatology is a young science with a huge ammount of data that needs better tools to be processed, like supercomputers not yet built. Global warming effects are not so predictable as Al Gore tells in this film, ignoring how scientific data must be presented. The graphical data by the end of the film with increasing temperatures are gross fake. And above all, the film is egocentric on Mr.Gore, who's is not a SCIENTIST.Good point if you start thinking on man affecting the enviroment in an uncontrollable way. But bad scientific data and too personal view of the matter. I'd like to see a BBC doc on the subject, with David Attenborough or just no one; sure can be better than this egocentric and simplistic view of an important matter."
5,People suck.,"If you don't believe in global warming, you're wrong. Want to be dumb? Fine. This document is great."
1,Always check both sides,"I just attended a global warming debate staged by the Spectator in London, England, a professor from Austrailia came over to show the scientific evidence against man mad global warming. The UK ""expert"" who was supposed to debate him refused to attend to argue his case,low and behold there wasn't a single ""expert "" in the whole of the UK who was willing to come and argue the case for man amde global warming.It's all well an good making bogus propaganda videos and pumping the schools and media full of lies, but when it comes down to discusing the real science there seems to be few decievers who are willing to stand up to scruitiny."
5,Definitely a Must See....,"I don't care who you are.. if you were ever skeptical about global warming and whether or not it is actually happening... you must see this movie... I think it should be shown in every school... every company and its executives, and government officials should see it.. starting with the President."
4,Inconvient truth,"I observed this DVD with keen interest. The facts revealed to back his argument are awesome. The current crop of world leaders, who are mostly against his conclusions, are hiding their heads in coal and oil. I trust that someday the occupants of the world will wake up and start to consider their living environment."
1,I don't care for Gore or these shock films.....,"I do not care for Gore. He is not a scientist, he is just a former politican who has no political future and decides to take this cause just so he looks good.The science in this program is misleading and will give people panic attacks. I do not deney the greenhouse effect, I just hate it when cheap guys like Gore and those who made this film use it in a yellow journalism way. But then again, when is anyone interested in hard data anymore?!"
5,wow! wake up people,"first watched this on tv & never forgot . It,s impacted my life in many ways . I recycle, and really try to leave less carbon footprint . preaching to my friends , is getting me teased and laughed at , so I bought this movie for them to watch and open their eyes.I,m in my 60,s and worry for my grandchildren."
4,Al Gore is a great Presenter,"Al Gore has the talent of public speaking and presenting problems in a way that the public can understand. While I do believe we have a problem called Global Warming, I also see that this documentry was enbelishing a bit for the sake of drama. I was glad that I watched this show, but was sorry that I actually bought it, since I won't really have a reason to watch it again. Worth a watch, not worth the ownership."
1,The usual global warming rubbish,Utter rubbish - which is all you can expect from Al Gore and the global warming crusaders.
1,What a crock!,"Not only does Al Gore own several businesses that are huge polluters here in Tennessee (the reason he didn't even win his own county in 2000 vote), but scientists around the world have said this piece of propaganda has no basis in fact. In the 70s, we were allegedly in another ice age and now we're into global warming. One has to wonder who makes the money on all of this tripe. Maybe one day someone will figure out that everything is cyclical. What a stupid piece of propaganda this is...and what a politician will do to get his name in the media!"
1,CLOSED-MINDED LIBERALS: DON'T READ THIS!,"Seeing this movie is a waste of time. If Gore really wanted to reach a target audience whom he could convince of this man-made global warming nonsense, he should have made it a cartoon:GORBOT: ENVIRONMENTAL SAVIOUR!Gore could have voiced a large robot character incapable of expressing true emotion.He could have gone around with his sidekick, a small bird on his shoulder called ""Chicken Little.""Everytime that GORBOT needed inspiration for what to talk about next, he could have looked down at what Chicken Little had left on his shoulder.It would have had about the same impact as this movie."
4,Important Information--But...,"This DVD is full of scientific knowledge regarding the degradation of our planet. However, the intertwinings of Al Gore's life with the important environmental information seems to muddy the good intentions of Mr. Gore's passionate pleas. I do appreciate his delivery of this message to America and the world. We all do not want to admit these truths exist. The idea that this is a MORAL issue needs to be taken up by all political persuasions."
5,Review of 'An Inconvenient Truth',Everyone should see this. Our government should wake up to the realities exposed in this documentary.
1,Reefer Madness,"This has to be one of the funniest movies made since Reefer Madness. None of Al Gore's views on climate change can be backed up by science. Now, we find out the Scientist he worked with have been manipulating the data for years... I'm sure that was necessary to continue receiving the millions of dollars in research funds they get from our Tax Dollars. Does anyone remember global cooling? Let's face it... the world has been changing for years with or without us. Has anyone ever heard of the ice age? How many cars did it take to warm that one up! Remember the Polar bears? We'll guess what.... there are more now then there was 50 years ago! See the movie and enjoy the laughs!"
1,Actually...,"From January 2007 to January 2008 there was a significant drop in temperature. In fact that time period was the coldest in recorded history. Plus, I live in Atlanta, GA and it SNOWED LAST MAY. If anyone says global warming exists, they must be living somewhere like, oh I don't know, the DESERT. So believe what you want; it's all a bunch of lies."
1,This DVD put me to sleep...literally.,"All I can say is...wow. After being put to sleep the first time I tried to watch it, I watched it again and can now conclude that this DVD is complete and utter BS. Al Gore takes global warming to a whole new level, one that is full of inaccuracy, random correlations, and strategically placed mush for sentimental effect. How anyone could say this is an accurate, convincing portrayal of global warming boggles my mind, because all I see is plenty of junk science. Enough said."
5,A Must Watch,"People are in denial but when our world is no long what it is today, it's going to be too late. Enjoying the warm months? We need to look at the bigger picture. Think of the warm months as destroying our planet, do you really want it to be warm. Pay it forward - all your family, friends, and colleagues - invite them over - watch this movie. Once you watch it, then you can decide. The movie is well written, demonstrated, and documented. Slide shows with Al Gore's intertwined through helps break up the fact finding. Movie changes you."
4,Watch and decide.,"Yes, it's a little murky on logic. It's a dull polemic. But it's also accurate in a way that's irreputal if you just watch it. All the angry 1-stars, I'm betting, have never gotten within 50 miles of this movie. Why would they bother with watching this liberal propoganda before they choose to review it based on whatever Rush or Hannity told them to say about it? It's an imporant, activist movie. It will scare everyone in America: half will be scared because it makes a pretty clear point about the damage we're doing to the earth; the other half will be scared because they see it as a full-frontal attack on whatever industries they work for, their poltical ideology, or their pocketbooks. You know what side you're on. I'm not saying either is better than the other. I'm just saying watch a movie before you review it."
5,Global Warming Affects the State of New Mexico,"I used the DVD in my three World Geography classes and the students responded well. They were given the assignment to write a 4 paragraph paper on (How does/will Global Warming Affect the State of New Mexico?). I have yet to peruse and grade them, but most of the students took the DVD and additional support information seriously. I recommend this DVD for Science classes as well as for Geography classes."
5,Global Warming,"If you liked Who Killed the Electric Car you will love this film...okay, it may depress you to listen to and watch Gore, the man was REALLY voted in as president. I felt so sad at the end of the film knowing that Bush has done so much damage in the name of OIL and GREED, and we could have had this thoughtful, intelligent (so not a C student in college like Bush) and articulate man, something the White House is sorely missing, a president who is articulate! But I digress...Gore gives various presentations with scientific facts, figures, and graphics that put Global Warming in perspective. It is real folks. How much longer are we going to wait to make our government get tough on pollution? Gore is amazing. You must see this."
1,Oh my...,"Since when does the Nobel Peace committee award their prize based on a sophistic work like this film? The movie certainly makes some plausible points, but there is plenty of scientific evidence by learned scholars to the contrary. Unfortunately, not everyone is an ex-vice-president with ties to just about every person of note in Hollywood. They haven't a chance in hell of getting their views out there with the kind of backing that Al Gore had for this film. It's not even the film that irks me as much as the man got a Nobel Peace Prize for it. That's just wrong, especially when you compare Al Gore to another Democrat Nobel Peace Prize winner like, say, Jimmy Carter who has REALLY done some amazing things with his life. VERY FRUSTRATING."
1,mindless hysteria,"The earth goes through cyclical changes in climate periodically. About 10,000 years ago the earth went through it's last ice age, where North America was covered by ice, and this had nothing to do with man-made carbon emissions. The sea level fell by 120m during the last ice age. The earth is constantly changing between glacial and interglacial periods naturally without the influence of man. I'd save your money and buy something truly educational, likeReversing: Secrets of Reverse EngineeringP.S. The sky is falling!!!!"
1,repetitive,Gore talks repetitively about the carbon dioxide levels on earth. Movie could've been cut down to about 35 minutes
1,Al Gore's science fiction,"Passion is no substitute for reason . An Inconvenient Truth is riddled with one sided , misleading , exaggerated and speculative statements statements as well as those which are just plain wrong . Combined with IPCC spurious statistics and conjectural worst cases it leads to economic agendas which will halt growth and all it has done to alleviate global poverty and misery in its tracks . Underpinning the phony and alarmist pseudo science is Al Gore's often expressed visceral hatred of modern society . We should not let his personal agenda ride rough shod over the livelihood of billions ."
2,"It's comedy, right?","I laughed, I cried...but mostly I laughed. It was snowing and freezing cold the day this came in the mail.What a load of hogwash."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK,"FACT: over 75% of total greenhouse gases is CO2! That's right, the gas we breathe out. It is also released by burning trees, and so our rainforest-burning friends in South America are to blame for 99% of global warming etc. Most of the remaining gases are also natural. Also, the world is coming out of a small ice age. Therefore, North Americans are not responsible. Well, maybe we're responsible for like 1% of the harmful gases. 1 friggin percent for a whole century of driving millions of automobiles. 1 friggin percent. WATCH SOMETHING ELSE"
2,"Let's be objective, Al.","I just watched this. I do not recommend it for people who like to be presented with both sides of an issue and form an objective, educated opinion. The film did have interesting points but it was full of statistics and studies used out of context.I would like to see a documentary with a little more objectivity and a lot less agenda.Don't get me wrong, we do need to each do our part to preserve the ozone. This is our home and we are all responsible. It's like having sloppy housemates in college. You can't constantly pick up after all of them, and you can't force them to change their ways.Let's all be consciencious of the effects of pollution and realize that we effect it individually. Remember that you can't control other people's pollution, but take comfort in knowing that there is a Power much greater than ours, and that is the Creator of this world.This movie only seems to try to create a panic about all this. Let's stay objective."
1,convenience,Al Gore gave this exact speach over ten years ago and said that within ten years the earth would end...
1,An idiotic truth,"Al Gore and company need to get their facts straight before setting image to celluloid, but that's never stopped them before. ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is junk science promoted by the loony liberal left and is just another scare tactic that they will embrace as their cause du jour. A better use of time and brainpower would be to read the book ""Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media"" by Patrick J. Michaels....but then Mr. Micheals didn't invent the Internet."
1,inconvenient because untrue,"Having seen this movie at a preview, I can say that Gore is every bit the equal of Michael Moore. Which is to say, he's a liar and a propagandist. Another reviewer summed up the truth nicely - there is in fact a global warming trend, and it may cause problems. But there is NO evidence that this trend is due to human causes or influences, and in fact, all evidence points to the contrary.Unless you're making up your facts, that is. Inconvenient indeed."
2,"Good, but too slow","An inconvenient truth is a movie about an aspiring environmentalist named Al Gore. Al travels the country collecting information and presenting it to the public. It dragged a little in the middle, and offered little in the realm of comedic value or romance. In the end, Al finishes this huge presentation (which takes up most of the movie) and the audience is captivated by it!Overall, it has a happy ending, but I have to give it 2 stars because it was a bit slow and didn't have a ""deleted scenes"" feature (which is a MUST now-a-days)."
1,Modern propadanda evolves to reach movie goers.,This movie is nothing more than propoganda. Educate and research Global Warming yourself instead of taking some politicians' word for it.
1,Americans Love to Eat Bull Sh!@#$,"I cannot believe all the five star ratings for a piece of such fluff fiction fantasy, by such and egomaniacal individual as Pappa Gore. Before anyone reviews this piece, perhaps a true science education is worth the pursuit... unless of course, you truly believe Gore did INVENT the internet! jeez!"
2,DVD non-compliance,"Yes, I was very excited to receive the product ad itwas packaged and delivered well.However, AMAZON should consider the situation with DVD ordersthat are NOT for the USA...meaning that there are DVD regionsin the rest of the non USA world.If someone orders a DVD, like I did, from Australia to Austrlia....it should send a signal that such need becompatible with the systems in that country.I took it for granted and assumed that AMAZON would knowwhere they were sending the product and meet the requirement.Also the DVD never did say ""for USA systems only"" or ""forcompatability with regions X,Y, Z""I am still waiting for my refund.CheersMark"
1,An Envirowackos Wet Dream,"More hysteria from the High Priest of the First Church of the Warming Globe.Al Gore desperately wants folks to believe that man-made global warming is a huge problem, and that the solution is more government control over our lives (i.e., more socialism -- yuck).Problem is, global warming is not primarily man-made. The last major ice age ended roughly 10,000 years ago; the earth has been in a general warming trend since then.Hey Al -- how many SUVs and factories were around 10,000 years ago to kick off the lastest global warming trend?"
1,What a sham!,"I guess if you like ""documentaries"" that are fictitious...then this is the MOVIE for you. It's really too bad that this work of fiction is so dishonest, but what do you expect. If you want facts, read something, don't listen to the man ""who invented the internet""."
1,yay propaganda!,I HATE this movie!!!! Never see it!!!! I HATE HATE HAT HATE HATE IT!!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST EVER MADE!!!!!! NEVER SEE IT!!!!!!!this is not a documentary! it is propaganda
1,Convenient Non-Truth,"Hogwash and psuedo-science. If man and his machines are truly the cause of today's global warming, then who was responsible for the previous times in earth's history for the cycles of warming and cooling? How do these same so called experts explain the warming caused by undersea volcanoes and increased solar radiation? As long as earth has existed, it has gone through cycles of heating and cooling, and most of it before man, aerosols, and SUV's were ever around. Yes, take care of the earth, but a life without technology is foolish, if not impossible. If Al Gore is so worried about global warming, tell him to fly commercial air instead of private jets, which is truly a huge waste of fuel and increase of hydrocarbons."
1,Amazon: don't send US-region DVD's to Europe!,I ordered the excellent Al Gore movie on climate change but I was not able to play the copy delivered by Amazon because it was the wrong region-code.The least thing AMAZON can do is to warn European customers when ordering such an item!
1,un usable copy of An Inconvenient Truth,"I have emailed you before with this complaint -- without reply. Perhaps you could consider an answer this time!You sent to UK a Region 1 disk when I obviously require a Region 2 copy for my DVD player. Is there any hope of you sending a usable item?I presume that you are supplying disks to all 6 Regions ,, Are they all Region 1 ??Thank you ,John"
5,A real eye opener!,"An Inconvenient Truth is an amazing documentary that stresses the importance of reducing greenhouse gases and spreading the word about global warming. Once you see this film, you will have a different view on global warming and its devastating effects. A must see for all people!"
5,An Inconvenient Truth,My wife and I absolutely enjoyed this video! It is very well done and extremely informative. We both highly recommend this to everyone who cares about our environment.
4,"An Inconvenient Truth, a science odyssey with a bite","The film is simply one of the best illustrated science films you will see. The graphics are superb. Better than just that, they are spiced with very thought-provoking vignettes from Al Gore's life. The most touching is the story of his sister's death from lung cancer, followed by his father's recognition that being a tobacco farmer did not cut it in the moral sphere. By the same token this business of global warming through our societal addiction to oil, coal and other ""cheap"" (if you don't count the consequences) fuels, is also brought out as a moral issue for our generation. So this film is not just a science film, it is a morality play in which you and I are players. It won't get you depressed, but it will get you in action."
1,Isn't America Great!,"If one tells a big-enough lie for a long-enough time, in America one can win a Nobel Peace Prize!"
1,Full of lies,We now know that Al Gore's propaganda was purely to help him gain a profit..... despicable.
4,It's a shame most negative reviews are political attacks,"I usually like to read the '1 star' reviews since they give good insight IMO, but it's a shame here that most of the negative ratings regarding this movie are more political attacks in disguise. If you use the link to review the other comments by these reviewers, you'll see that there is a pattern of negative reviews on books/movies written/made by democrats or 'left' leaning books.If you want to preview what this movie is about, you can go to Google Video and see an overview of what Gore will talk about in this video.I thought it was a good overall production, but not a 'debate-type' of movie that I'd prefer. Still, good to see a clear picture of the 'for' side of the argument.In short, IMO it's done well enough not to deserve 1 star so discount those that give it as reviewing with an agenda. A shame for those of us who like to hear from those who have something interesting to say against a certain book or movie."
5,Watch this movie,"This movie startles you with the facts of how bad things are, and makes you disappointed in the stubbornness and self serving attitude of the government. We already know they protect the big oil companies, but this shows how appallingly ignorant they choose to be."
1,Al Gore is a genius.,Let's all watch Al Gore's film on our energy sucking electronics so we can feel guilty for doing so. The only person not feeling guilty about your destroying the planet to watch this film is Al Gore who is getting not-so-inconveniently paid by this truth.
5,An Inconvenient Truth,"It is an excelent film, well made and a film that should be shown in all of our schools world wide.Gregory E. MarshallYelm, WA"
4,Everyone should see this DVD!,"Very well done. This video explains the science behind global warming in a way that is easy to understand. It also shows a side of Al Gore we did not see much of in the presidential campaign - funny, passionate and human. Shows how we can no longer afford to ignore this issue and what we can do to slow and even reverse the effects of global warming. Get a copy and loan it to all your friends."
4,eye opening,"THIS MOVIE OPENS YOUR EYES TO REALIZATION. YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHATS HAPPENING TO OUR EARTH, OUR HOME, UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE.GORE ADDS IN A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS LIFE. BUT THROUGH ALL HIS HARDSHIPS HE STILL KEPT GOING AND IS STILL GOING ON TO DO WHAT HE CAN TO SAVE OUR PLANET. IF WE ALL PITCHED IN,WOW!IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO TO SAVE OURSELVES, OUR CHILDREN, OUR EARTH. I KNOW IT DEFINITELY TOUCHED ME."
5,Important topic,Thius movie covers a very important topic for our world. I recommend seeing this movie to everyone.
4,Video-An Inconvenient Truth,Wife purchased this for aid in classroom - teaches science subjects. Seemed to work OK.
4,"Very informative, a bit too long.","This movie starts out great, showing graphics and pictures of what's really happening to our environment. But unfortunatly, I think it goes too much into Al Gore's life, and that's where you loose me. I still feel I was told some very important information that I can never forget, but maybe if they cut out some stuff, it would be an excellent movie. I still reccomend everyone see this movie to save our world."
5,See for yourself,This subject is too important to base your opinions on whether you like Al Gore. I found the picture fascinating. See it and decide for yourself if it fits for you.
5,An Inconvenient Truth for all of us not only for one,"No matter how much evidence, facts, and logic support it, people will always continue to deny it. That's why the negative reviews don't actually refute what Gore says. Or provide any real scientific facts. BUT: The audience applauded.**********"
5,We need to take responsibility!,"This film really reaches out and puts it in everyone's face that we all need to take responsibility! What are we doing to our children's world? What kind of political games and money grubbing, power hungry craziness justifies ruining the future of our Earth? The supposed ""cycle"" of the Earth has just gone off the charts! Come on! New energies and technology solutions will help create a much smarter, healthier economy that just giving false gasoline incentives to goofballs to drive SUV's to the Gap, and wonder how China, India, Japan, etc are overtaking the US economy."
5,An Inconvenient Truth,"Essentially a big-screen version of the PowerPoint presentation Gore has been presenting to politicians, activists, college students, and concerned citizens around the world for over a decade, ""Truth"" is both a teach-in and a resolute call to action. Pilloried for his wonkish stiffness in the 2000 presidential campaign, Gore here pokes fun at his own image and shows an easygoing humorous side, even during the course of explaining a deadly serious world problem. Devoid of whiz-bang spectacle, this urgent and timely film delivers exactly what it promises: the unvarnished ""Truth,"" however inconvenient it may be to get our heads around."
2,um.........,"Being a climatologist for 20 years I bit the bullet and watched the movie. Politics and science have no place in bed together. and that is just what this movie is. a political agenda. Sorry, the earth goes thru climate cycles every so often, Either on a micro or macro level....what would Mr. Gore have called the great ice age? What would Mr. Gore have called the great dust bowl of the 30's? Gobal warming? It's a nice movie, nice visuals and landscapes......but proving science? no. Remember, the earth is 72% water, 72% carbon and oxygen! The earth lives and dies because of water content.....not because of us. If Gore is right...we are dead, with no chance of fixing the problem. The fix doesn't exist to make a difference in our dying. 100 years of industrial revolution does not make 10,000,000 years null and void."
1,An inconvenient truth - fiction not fact,This movie should be placed in the fiction or fantasy category because there is very little truth. If you want to listen to a D student and non-scientist and proven liar lecture you then watch this movie. If you want the true science on global warming read The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming by Christopher C. Horner a climatologist.This movie is a distortion of the facts and a total waste of time. Unless you have drunk the kool-aid of course.
1,What truth?,"This movie is to truth as oil is to water. Al gives one heck of a strong sermon, but as a scientist is a complete flop. He offers anecdotal evidence aplenty that the world is warming-- but it's not proof. He offers no compelling evidence that CO2 is causing this warming and, in fact, the only evidence he DOES offer on that shows exactly the opposite-- that global warming causes CO2. Finally, he offers no evidence at all that humans are creating the CO2 increase in an amount equal to the problem. Finally, he says that we only have ten years to save the planet. Considering he started saying that nine years ago, I think we should just ignore him and try to live with it. We're doing pretty well so far."
3,Global warming,Was a very interesting movie. Bought it because my little brother was doing his senior project on global warming. He loved the movie
3,LESS THAN EXPECTED,"WITH ALL THE HYPE, I EXPECTED MORE. IT WAS A GOOD START FOR THE CAUSE. THIS IS BEING WRITTEN AFTER THE AWARDS SHOW, SO EVIDENTLY I'M IN THE MINORITY. PERHAPS THE NEXT TRY FOR GLOBAL WARMING, IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE, WILL BE A BETTER PRODUCTION."
5,Education on what is really happening,"I thought this was a very informative film. To be able to see how much the glaciers are changing, and how much change in ice flows there are. Was fascinating to see the effects of sea level raise would have on different parts of the world."
4,Will We Eventually Just Burn Up?,"I really enjoyed this video and wish I owned a copy. It is a FAST-moving documentary on a controversial subject: global warming. The video was well-designed. We were required to watch this AND read transcripts from a show on Glenn Beck. It would APPEAR that there are missing pieces in the video presentation, but I think it is well worth the time to view and to consider the facts. We CAN (and do) contribute either to making our planet healthy - or UNhealthy. Check it out and see what you think. In fact, you can RENT this baby right here on Amazon.com! THAT was a super plus for me."
1,Speaking of inconvenient truths....,"Al Gore is a pompous, obese, mind-numbingly opportunistic sack of horsefeathers, and no amount of liberal hand-wringing is going to repair the San Andrean-sized cracks in HIS humpty skull. I would like to ask Gore and all of his band of lemming-brained, hemp-huffing tree-huggers: What Is Your Goal? To keep CO ommissions at current levels? At past levels? WHICH past? Pre-industrial revolution past? New deal past? Monica-on-her-knees past? Do we cut off all industry today or tomorrow? Do we implement Kyoto without China and India and pretend that it's okay to simply ignore 2/3 of the human race?A power point presentation about how we're all gonna die unless we --what? Turn over control of the world to Al and Tipper?Get a grip, children. Then set your blackberries on stun."
1,Great fiction,It would be interesting to be around 100 years from now. We would all get a good laugh out of this fiction. It was well done.
1,Looney tunes,"As a geologist I can tell you the Earth goes through climate changes all the time. It has since it came into existence. It warms up and it cools down. It is the way of things. For Al to give you all the impression we can change, reverse, or whatever the climate of the Earth is ridiculous. At best we may postpone the change, but stop it? Not bloody likely. Believe what you want, but Al is full o [...]on this one. The only way the KT would be effective is if every single country participated and they aren't. The US is not the only country opting out of this farce. Ironic how the KT will end up killing the very trees, for the paperwork required, we need to help the atmosphere.Good job Al. Kill the trees and blame someone else other than yourself."
1,A convenient truth for the Democrats.,"As an Meteoroglist with many years of experience the idea of global warming is a recurring part of the cycle of earth. This has occurred many times in the past. Alarmist include Al Gore doesn't take in account the history of climate change over decades instead of just a few years from the 1970's. This year was suppose to the be worst hurricane season ever, what happened. The Gulf and Atlantic oceans were warmer than usual but the Pacific Ocean was colder. That equals balance. Sure man has changed the climate a bit but not as bad as Al Gore wants you to believe. The polar ice caps have melted but warmer temperatures cause more rain over these regions which replace the ice cap. This is anothe cycle of earth. This video is nothing more than polical crap, just like Al Gore invented the internet."
1,The worst political movie in history,"This movie is a rip-off. I can't belive that people spend 0.00$ to be brainwashed! Im' a proud republican, and all you fans of Al Gore should think on both sides of the politics. Tell me, is it so hard to put on Fox news once in while, instead of be brainwashed by lies on CNN? All I ask if this: do you want to be convinced Global Warming is in effect, blindly buy so-called ""Anti-Global Warming Lightbulbs"",and waste your money on something not even proven to work, or do you want to sencibly listen to a Conservative Republian? I think you know what side im on. ""Truth!"". (The opposite of this movie.)"
1,Al Gore sucks... ZERO STARS,"Al Gore is not a proffesional scientist. repeat: NOT a scientist. he is giving you the information that he found becuase he wanted to find it, and he wants you to see it. hes not telling you the other half of it, the half that makes sense, the half that real scientists agree on. al gore is a polititian.hes good at presenting info in a good manner and good at getting you to side with him, but thats all. he doesnt know what he's talking about."
1,"Inconvenient Lie! The Sky Is Falling, The Sky Is Falling.","Al Gore is a moron. And there is not much worse in this life than being lectured to by an avuncular dolt.There are countless scientists who give no credence whatsoever to the notion of a man-made climate change. The whole notion of ""global warming"" was based upon an incorrect computer model that could in no way take all parameters and data into account.In this movie we are lectured to by a boring idiot whose only recourse to changing the political world is through environmental scare tactics.If you have some time to kill and absolutely nothing else to do with it, then buy and watch this movie. I would rather watch paint dry or grass grow, they are far more honest processes."
1,The father of the Internet right?,"Okay, when I first saw the trailer for this movie I was excited. I consider myself a green person and I am always interested in learning more about how I can have a positive impact on the planet. Unfortunately, Al Gore is what the movie is about. Yeah, he spouts off all kinds of facts about temperatures and former glaciers but it seems to me that there are some pretty irrelevant things pertaining to his own life in there. First off, I really don't care that he lost the presidency, yeah so it was a ""big blow"" to him, what does that have to do with global warming? Second, thanks for taking us to your childhood farm(?). Seriously, these bits turned me right off. As you can see my title is ""The father of the Internet right?"" and as many of you know he has proclaimed his ""hand"" in the invention/rise of the Internet (forget the scientists). I just feel like this guy is too easy to spot as one of ""those"" politicians."
1,I Hate Humans,"Hello, I am am Mother Nature speaking against the evil abominable sins of humans.You humans, you evil, braindead, environment destroying, stupidheads. I have grown sick and tired of your ways. Mother Nature will unleash her judgement upon you for your abominable, ungodly, wicked ways. She will rain fire and brimstone on your cities for reelecting President Bush. Your sinful use of hairspray and SUVs will be the destruction of you. I will unleash my revenge. You humans are doomed. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.Ok, here's another sign of the apocalypseAl Gore does a documenary convincing Americans that unless they vote for him, global warming is going to get worse and the icecaps are going to melt and we are all going to die. Yes, I knew it. This world is going to end in stupidity and fear, listening to the advice of stupid people. Very, very sad."
4,"Seriously, No Case?","I bought this as a gift for my mother's movie collection. This movie is a must see, but it came in a little cardboard case! Not a plastic case, like all other movies come in. Now, I am as close to a ""tree hugger"" as they reasonably come, but this is even a little silly to me. My mom will just throw away/recycle the case it came in & go buy a case that will fit on her shelf. I was disappointed that it still cost $20 with no case."
5,We need to wake up,"Most people, who have bashed this film on here, have never even seen it. We seriously need to wake up people. This isn't an issue of republicans or democrats, its an issue of humanity. And if we continue to argue and fight we'll never get this solved and our stupid behavior will ruin our children's lives. For all those who are against abortion, I hope you are against the extinction of the human race as well."
1,An Inconvenient Review,"If you need to watch a story based on bad science and fantasy,buy The Bride of Frankenstein.The plot is just about as believable,but the acting is much better.And Boris Karloff registers ten times the personality of Al Gore."
1,Al Gore and his tree lovers are full of sh**,"There's no manmade global warming. At least give yourself a try an listen to another DVD that gives you the other side of the story: The Great Global Warming Swindle"" a Martin Durkin's documentary."
2,An Inconvenient Bore!!!,"This was pretty boring. Listening to the guy who lost to George Bush talking about global warming the whole movie. This would be for educational purposes only, and not for entertainment. I wouldn't recommend AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH!!!"
1,Come on.....,"The funny thing is how much press and publicity is generated by this subject, when the total amount of greenhouse gases that are put into the atmosphere by mankind is a MINISCULE FRACTION of what is put into the atmosphere from natural sources. Humans are not responsible for global warming. It is a natural phenomenon! Unfortunately, democrats have fooled uneducated people into thinking that it is caused by humans, and that the only way to save our world is to vote for them."
1,A Two Hour Campaign Commercial,"Is Al Gore upset with global warming or the fact that he lost the 2000 election campaign. Al Gore could have produced a genuine movie about global warming, but he commonly misstates facts throughout the movie, all the while of trying to raise emotions by showing the 2000 election, pictures and stories of his family, and the Gore ranch. He really dropped the ball on his global warming message by clouding the message with such nonsense. My question to Gore is, is he testing the temperatures of the ocean or the current political climate for a possible run in 08?Global warming is a natural process, and if you want to read sound information about global warming, see Peter Wards article in the October 2006 Scientific American. It will be an hour of your life better spent."
1,Al Gore : Junk Science professor,"Isn't this the guy who said he invented the internet? Nobody ever seems to question the ""truths"" these idiots come up with. World temps have been steadily increasing since before the industrial revolution.Toxins we are producing (pesticides, solvents and others) are far more worrisome than ""Gloibal Warming"""
1,Ridiculous,"Mr. Gore obviously has not taken into account an accurate - and unbiased - view of the scientificic evideince on the subject. I would write more, but it is a waste of time given Mr. Gore's obvious policical, and frankly inadequatate and misleading, perspective on the subject... Ridiculous and not worth your hard-earned money. If you would like more objective, and entertaining, information I suggest ""State of Fear"" by Michael Crichton."
5,everyone should see this,an inconvenient truth should be required for all students to see; the future of this country is in the hands of our young people and somehow we need to get their attention that this is real
2,Cardboard Case?,"I was displeased to receive this $20 DVD in nothing more than a thin, cardboard case, when I was giving it as a Christmas gift. The packaging boasts that the case can be recycled. However, no one plans to throw it out. I thought it was sneaky to be sold this in such cheap packaging and was embarrassed to give it as a gift. On a shelf of DVDs at home, one can't find it very easily in the midst of those DVDs with REAL cases."
2,"Boring Movie By ""The Man Who Invented The Internet""","What an awful movie. From an entertainment standpoint what can be more boring then Al Gore standing in front of an audience lecturing for 90 minutes. I was expecting a documentary in the vein of ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" or ""Fahrenheit 911."" The information about global warming is there but it is presented in such an analytical form that all the numbers seem to just not make sense after a while. This movie also seems to be a bit of an ego trip for Al Gore. Half the movie is about his personal life which I truly couldn't give a rats a** about. Al Gore also seems like a bit of a hypocrite. While talking about saving the earth, Al Gore drives around his ranch in a truck and flies around the world in highly pollutant airplanes. I just didn't enjoy this movie. If its on TV and you have an No-Doz capsule available try giving it a viewing. If not, you don't have half a chance of staying awake through the whole movie."
1,This movie is full of Edited BS!,"This movie is a bunch of BS! Somehow Al Gore has become scientist and knows more about a topic that most scientists cant even agree on. To think that humans are the main cause for global warming is a bit arrogant, ask any true meteorologist about what they think of this crappy fairytale.The Inconvenient Truth is the fact that this movie costs you too much, and that Global Warming is a natural cycle with many causes, the sun being the major one. Do your research before you decide to fall for this ""Mockumentary""Someone ask Al Gore how he gets to all his book signings and publicity stunts, I suspect by planes or Helicopter, which burn ""harmful Fuels"" Can anyone say Hypocrite? Personally I don't care how he gets there, but these people spout this nonsense and don't follow what they preach."
5,Eye opener,Excellent explanation about global warming from the scientific and political point of view.
5,How can you buy or sell the earth?,"This we know: All things are connected. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.Chief Sealth 1854"
5,Pass it On,I've purchased 10 copies of this DVD to distribute as Christmas presents.Let's make it one of the best selling and best distributed DVD's of all time.If you believe in personal responsiility for conserving our environment pass it on by giving copies of this DVD to as many as you can.
1,Wash. Rinse. Repeat.,"In order to discern the truth within this global debate, all one needs to do is ""follow the money."""
2,"Incomplete, and has disputable facts, but well intentioned.","Read the book Super Freakonomics and find out more about the disputable facts Al Gore presents in this movie. There are other errors in this flick that aren't even mentioned in Steve Dubner's book. However, I assume Gore was well intentioned when he did this, and that much means a lot. When working to improve something, we to be more careful that we do not make mistakes when presenting our arguments, as sometimes that can be the downfall of a noble cause. And, while there might be errors, it is downright silly to discard this. Thanks Al Gore. Better luck next time!"
1,An embarrasing lie.,What this documentary DOESN'T tell you is that all of the big concerns that Mr. Gore uses to frighten his viewers occur *naturally*. SeeGlobal Warming: A Scientific and Biblical Expose' of Climate Change.
5,A very important Truth,We must begin to grow up. Our county uses more energy and resources than any other nation in the world with no seeming regard for the resuts of this unbridled consumption! Please see this film - it will make you understand. Our government must change or we will distroy our beautiful blue earth; our only home. Write to your congressmen and demand a change!Make changes in your on life - I have!
5,Easy to follow the essentials,"The presentation is easy to follow and the consequences are drastic. A realy good example how to transport a message. However, for the European continent the demonstrations are perhaps too dramatically and overdrawn.It would be nice if the product could be delivered with an area code other than 1 (USA)."
1,UK Lawsuit Judgement Exposes False Findings,The recent legal judgement in the United Kingdom against former Vice-President Gore for unethical data analysis in this film does not help the global warming religious movement. The film can no longer be shown in U.K. schools unless they point out the falsehoods.
1,Lies based on Lies,"This entire Global Warming movement will go down in history as the ultimate hoax of all time. Carbon does NOT cause global warming and only comprises .054% of the Earth's green house gases. That's less than a single percent. Man can only effect 9% of that .054%. It's all a lie to turn on the carbon tax system which will redistribute wealth, exterminate the blacks in Africa, and give total and utter power to the Elite. Watch ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" to see a real piece of scientific fact."
5,Very Interesting!!,"I have watched it twice, and have passed it on to friends and family.....it is an excellent look at Global Warming. I had no idea the magnitude of it.I would highly recommend it to anyone."
4,A must see for anyone who cares,"Al Gore is to be commended for taking this issue to the world.Global Warming is destroying the Earth but it is still within our capacity to overcome the destruction.It is perhaps sad that we need a politician to spread the warning that scientists have been giving us for years, but, we pray that people will listen and act to counter this terrible menace.Whatever it takes, we need to hear the message, heed the message, spread the message, and spring to action now.""An Inconvenient Truth"" can help."
4,An Inconvenient Truth,An Inconvenient Truth was an extra credit opportunity for my college non-lab science course. The politics and name calling and insults were unnecessary and actually diminished any respect I did have for Mr. Gore just as a human being. The science in the documentary was great.
5,Just watch it!,"Al Gore's message may be focused on U.S. citizens most directly, but it's something every adult and teenager on the planet needs to watch. He's a surprisingly classy and effective speaker, and if you think you don't need to see it, you've probably been successfully manipulated by the oil lobby! We need to turn ourselves and our western lifestyles around now. Watch this film and share it with your friends, your family, your colleagues and anyone else you can think of."
5,Do you trust politicians?,"I wish politicians were analyzing scientific data closer, better and with a sincere unbiased view. Many politicians just focus on money, profit/success and short-sighted advantages. Which politician would prepare his people for what happens in 50 years? We need politicians with an IQ far above 100. A must-see-movie.In my eyes Al Gore should return to the big political scene. I would welcome him as president of the USA in 2008."
1,Another 'The-Sky-Is-Falling' thesis from Mr 'I Invented The Internet',Don't waste your time with this trash!The Coral Ridge show did a better jobwith there TRUTHFUL DVD!
1,Fakery created to dupe the masses,"[...]At best, it's a documentary on the sorry state of government-run alleged ""schools"" that so many can be fooled by a greedy gasbag politician who himself uses 20 times the average amount of energy as the homes of the Normal-American Community.It may be too late already, but WAKE UP, America! Sheesh, it's just embarrassing."
4,A Little Scary,If even a small portion of this is true then it is worth watching and showing the kids. Added to their constant diet of Spongebob and Ninja Turtles; I seriously doubt a bit of enviromental awareness is going to be a bad thing. Just wish the other reviewers would chill out and review the stupid movie. Save the other stuff for I'm a Nazi right winger dot com.
1,A Huge Lie,"If You see this movie , you should also read ""The Politcally Incorredt Guide to Global Warming and Evironmrntalism"" by CHRISTOPHER C. HORNER.Not as flashy, and boring to read, but if you can get through it, the real truth about ""global warming"" will come to light.Point by point, Mr. Gores theory is completely disproven. You will be shocked as I was."
1,Complete and utter garbage,"This film (and the global warming argument in general) is so full of holes that only the most gullible would believe it. Every argument that tries to connect temperature increases to ""greenhouse gases"" ends up being based on little more than circumstancial evidence. To make it worse, the British government pointed out that ~9 of the big arguments in this film site faulty statistics. For something that won Gore a nobel prize, you'd think the evidence could at least be based in truth. Go ahead and do a search for ""global warming"" on the net. What you'll find is a whole lot of research showing that climate changes are happening (big surprise there; end of an ice age), but what you won't find is hard evidence that actually shows that man is to blame. So next time you think about buying into the hype, go protest volcanos since they put more pollution into the atmosphere than anything man has ever done."
5,Interesting,"Very thought provoking video. Should stir up some good discussion for a social studies class. Wether you agree or disagree with Al Gore, it should make you think."
1,DVD you sent does not work in Finland,"Dear Amazon,I am very unhappy of your service regarding my recent DVD order.I assumed you would have automatically mailed me such a DVD that would work in Finland. Now you mailed me the DVD that works in the US but not outside of the US, although my mailing address clearly defines FINLAND.Dis I lose my money or are you willing to re-send me another DVD that would work in Finland. Please advise.SincerelyAslak Siljander"
4,The Ageing Earth,"All facets of a presentation constituting this highly informative doco fit perfectly a professional politician's statesman expertise gained at the top positions while working for the superpower the USA are.However, picturesquely depicting the real threats to accustomed natural environment on this planet seemed subtly avoiding a question of the gradual ageing of the Earth itself."
4,Looks Good,the ring looks really good and i havent had a problem with it. The gold parts are fadeing off a little bit but barely enough that somebody could tell. Plus it does make my hand feel less cramped.
1,Wristband broke in the first week.,The wristband broke the first week I wore the watch. I have had 2 of these watches in the last 20 years and both performed very well. Hopefully I can return it for a new one....
1,Perfect except for the band,"This is an awesome watch. It is really light weight, and the face is very readable. If you can guarantee that you will never bump into anything, get it caught on anything, take it on and off too many times, or look at it funny, then the watch will work great.That being said, the watch band is horrible. It will break off. I have had three of these. I liked the watch so much, I even considered trying to drill it and make my own pin. If you are not willing/able to do that, then you might as well not get the watch."
2,Tinex ironman,This Timex Ironman is my 3rd one of the same model in 15 years I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a durable well constructed wacth.
2,Horrible Band,"This watch looks great, it's light weight, and is easy to program and use. The worst thing about this watch, and it's a big thing, is the band. It's junk. If you read the rest of the reviews, you'll see that. The pins in the band are very touchy. I'm pretty hard on watches and the band of this watch just doesn't hold up. I've repaired it 4 times and it still falls apart when it is bumped.The watch looks nice but it's not durable. Save your money and put it on a more durable watch... you'll be thankful you did."
2,Timex has gone downhill,"I have been a long time Timex watch fan for over 30 years and keep going back to them whenever my old watch dies, breaks, or otherwise becomes unusable. This was the case recently when part of the plastic area near the band's holding pin had broken off. Since this was not a simple ""fix"", I decided to get this Ironman Traditional watch from Amazon. However, when I opened the box, I found that the band was not fully attached to the watch! I was able to get this re-attached, I thought, but it popped out again and due to its design, it was impossible for me to get it secured. This has proven to me that Timex has diminished their quality and has made me look for an alternative. It is too late now to return the watch as I threw away the box. Bad decision in this as well the original decision to stay with Timex!"
1,Worst math textbook.,"Had to use this textbook for an intro-level linear algebra class. Totally incomprehensible. Strange math jargons came out of nowhere at the beginning of the chapter without a proper introduction. Lack proofs and explanation how certain methods of computation were made. Emphasizes on applications that don't make sense. Unless you're an engineer, I would not recommend this textbook to beginners who are just starting out linear algebra."
1,Worst book ever,"This book is only good if you know group theory, and have taken a math level 300 class that teaches you how to proof. If you dont know how to proof, then your screwed. This book sucks for intro to Linear Algebra for student who do not know hot to prove. A better book for an Intro to linear is Intro to Linear with Larson 6E."
3,Math is easy once you know how,Not bad so far. I like how it gets to the point and doesn't overindulge the reader with extra information.
1,Little or No Examples,I found this book very difficult to follow along without a teacher to explain. Little or no examples. Book is full of proofs. This would be a perfect book for a person to brush up on there skills and review the material.
2,buy the reissued classics instead,"I have been as big a meat puppets fan as anybody for as long as I can remember, but i can't stomach this album. Way too chord based, lyrically contrived and truly an overall disappointment. The strengths of their best early albums were the Kirkwoods' ability to make a beautiful mess, never resorting to the pure chord-rock of so many punk contemporaries, and always with beautiful, slightly cryptic but perpetually insightful lyrics. all that is lacking on this very conventional release. If you want to hear good heavy meat puppets, buy the oustanding reissued debut album. not this."

2,Brilliant Prognostication,"This book appears to have been originally published just before the NASDAQ crash in March of 2000. The copy that I purchased from Amazon.com appears to be a private re-publication of really first class quality by Ned Davis Reseach after the event. It was probably used as a presentation to clients and prospective clients to show the quality of his forecasting. Davis hit it right on the money. There is no doubt about that, and this book reflects his reasoning process before the event, unlike so many books written in hindsight."
2,Stupid...,"Just another one of those low budget, stupid stoner movies. My buddy let me have it for a day, and I was pretty bored watching it. There were a few funny scenes, but for the most part a very crummy movie. Nothign Nothing like Cheech and Chong. Don't waste your money."
1,Avoid if possible,I had to buy this book for a real estate class.The total amount of useful information in this bookwould take up about 20 pages. It is extremely repetitiveand seems to be written for the high school level;lots of stupid drawings of money bags and dollar signs.
5,If only more meeting planners would use these techniques..,"This gets five stars just because I think more people should use the concepts in this book for meetings, planning, etc. So simple and easy to do and it makes meetings go so much smoother and more efficient. It would have gotten four stars, because the format of the book could have been better organized, but I think it should be required reading before anyone can plan a project or lead a meeting."
3,ONLY THE BASICS,If you have never facilitated a session with post-its this book is a great start. If you are an advanced facilitator there's really nothing new here.
3,"Useful, but twice as long as it needs to be","Straker details six easy-to-use tools for group problem solving. Breaking complex problems down into bite-sized chunks, each fitting on a sticky note, makes it easy to move them around, try out different categorization schemes, map work flows, and prioritize. The tools are simple and the book includes many useful examples. My only critique is that the book is twice as long as it needs to be the convey its content. The author's website [...] includes a lot of other interesting tools for helping groups work together creatively."
2,Very Light Reading,I'm a big fan of using rapid prototyping in a variety of ways - from everything from designing software products to building consensus in meetings and setting priorities. There was nothing new in this book that a smart person with the general idea wouldn't be able to come up with on their own. There is a lot of white space in the book and many rudimentary ideas are explained in painful detail. No case studies and really only one application (building consensus and prioritization in meetings). The contents of the book might be better contained in a five page pamphlet.
1,The table of contents is everything.,"What is with offering the ""look inside"" feature but then blocking out all the actual content?If your book has so little real content that allowing me to see the table of contents feels too threatening, then it can't have much real value inside. Maybe if I saw the TOC I'd see the whole book, minus a few pictures (and probably a lot of padding)?"
2,Rapid Problem Solving with Post-It Notes,"Looks ok, but the book had a binding error -- the first chapters were repeated, and the middle section was missing. Sending it back."
1,Inquire about colors,"The product was exactly the size and quality that I expected it to be. But if you're like me and you are purchasing this product for appearance just as much as function, you may want to inquire as to the actual colors of the product. I purchased this product thinking it was pink, brown, and pale yellow. When I received the actual laptop sleeve it had teals, lime green, and several other colors that aren't in the picture. Beware!"
3,Flat compared to Tortilla,"I am an ardent fan of Boyle but this book left me cold. Compared to Tortilla Flat, the characters lacked believability and who cared about any of them. Dana (the real Dana) got on my nerves and I didn't even come close to undertanding a thing about what it is like to be deaf. I know Mr. Boyle is a gourmet cook (had I not known this it would have been quite obvious from his lengthy cooking descriptions), but I think he would have been better served to research a bit more about the deaf world. This book seemed to me to have been dashed off in a hurry. You can do better T.C."
3,Better than average but doesn't really deliver by the end,"This is my first Boyle book and while the writing is top notch, it is clear that he struggles with this type of genre fiction. The writing carries the day as there isn't much story. Boyle sets tone and mood very well and clearly he has done his homework on the hearing impaired aspect of the character Dana but at some point the storyline loses steam and while the characters are interesting, the story doesn't advance much. There is a bit of excitement towards the end, but 3/4 of the way through I had pretty much figured out how things were going to end. All that said, Boyle's writing and descriptive style is superb so I never wanted to stop reading the book. Three stars because he is clearly a greater talent than this book displays."
2,come on you guys be honest!,I am a HUGE TC Boyle fan but this book was just not up to snuff. Formulaic! Hated it!
4,"Not his best, but still great","T.C. Boyle's best work, IMHO, was Tortilla Curtain, but anything this man writes is a delight to readers who enjoy top-flight literary fiction."
3,Terrible Ending!,"Without being a spoiler, the ending was very disappointing. It is very frustrating to read a book that is well written and keeps your attention, only to get to a very disappointing ending. Sometimes it feels as if authors get tired of writing and just want to say ""the end"". That is the way that I felt with this book. Good plot... good pace... then you reach the end and ""no satisfaction"".Additionally, I felt no sympathy for the villain in this book... despite what the NY Times said in their review."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I am a long-time TC Boyle fan, especially of his novels Riven Rock, Budding Prospects, and The Road to Wellville (his best novel IMO).However, I found Talk Talk a bit slow and uninspiring. The plot bumped along without much excitement, and the characters are not very well developed or beliveable. The story never got going for me, and I couldn't find a solid connection to the main characters (especially Dana). I bailed about 3/4 of the way through it, and would have quit earlier if it hadn't been written by Boyle.I'm looking forward to reading The Women, and will continue to read everything from Boyle who is one of my favs!"
2,Falls flat in the end,"This is the first time I've ever felt like reviewing a book. Actually, it is more of a warning to potential readers. While the character development is good and parts of the book make you want to keep turning pages to find out what happens next, the ending completely falls apart. There were also a few parts where there was too much detail about something that ended up not being very pivotal to the plot, but I would have forgiven that had the story ever gotten wrapped up.If you like a book to have an ending where either the good guy or the bad guy prevails, then don't read this book. Pretty disappointing. This was my first book by this author and I will not likely try him again."
2,I stopped reading,"I stopped reading when the character Dana gets her identity thief's driver's license in the mail. Boyle goes out of his way to explain that California will let you renew by mail if you have no outstanding warrants, yet the whole beginning of the book is Dana being arrested due to outstanding warrants of her identity thief. I feel like Comic Book guy here, but sorry, this is just lazy writing. Just one of several plot inconsistencies that made me unwilling to bother with this one."
5,Will make you stop and think,"This book about identity theft will make you stop and think. There are wonderful characters that portray how it feels to be a victim of identity theft. The plot has twists along the way which keeps the story moving along. I was surprised by the story and think it is a good one. The best quote I saw after reading Talk Talk is from the Portland Oregonian. ""Yet the book as a whole still resonates beyond the end, having provided not just entertainment but also tangible new experiences for readers to absorb."""
4,Great storytelling!,"I have not yet read much by TC Boyle, but what I have read I've enjoyed immensely, and this book is no exception. Briefly, it involves a hearing-impaired woman and her boyfriend and the man who stole the woman's identity. The way Mr Boyle gets into each character's head, shows his or her most primal motives, is just genius. The plot moves along, the characters are interesting, the writing is crisp, funny, smart, and sometimes mean (in a good way!). Others have given more detailed reviews; I just wanted to add my voice to those who liked the book."
5,Additional Lionel Lockons work great,Good product and works very well. I have added these 2 additional lockons to my track and now I find that there is a much more consistent current throughout the entire track.
5,Works Great,"I replaced an old 50 year old lockon that had just had it after that many years. Works great, really like the ""newer"" design."
2,"I normaly love the techno trax, I don't know what this was",Every single song sounded the same. It doesn't even touch any of the other techno trax. I was very upset when I bought this.
5,Anchor Lead Chain,"Exactly as described, good quality and good price.After some additional information gathering I would have gone with a much longer chain for my 23ft boat, most likely a lead chain of 20ft to 25ft to help settle the anchor.Like I said this product is fine for what it is, no regrets."
5,Ready to dig a little deeper?,"Conversations On Purpose would be a good workbook for a women's bible study or it can be used individually. It is a challenging tool for finding your strengths and weaknesses, finding what you need to surrender to God, and finding hope as you seek His purpose."
5,A brave book for brave women,"Finally, a book that requires us to be brutally honest with ourselves and with God -- from there, the sky's the limit!"
5,Caddyrack Saves Irons,"Nice addition to any golf bag.Keep your irons in order.Keep your irons from banging into each other.Eliminates rattling and creates more room for woods(metals)If you have a nice set or irons, protect them with Caddyshack"
4,No more irons left on the golf course!,"I like the fact that you can see at a glance that you have all the irons that belong in the organizer. It has saved me a lost club or having to go back to find it (maturity causes lost personal items). The first one broke (bubbles in the plastic) the factory sent me a free replacement without proof of the breakage, I only paid for the shipping. The new one is now several month old - so it works fine."
3,Witty and charming!,"I found this book to be very charming. The author shines when describing the physical angst of midlife. Her humor is gentle and a bit sappy, but very heartfelt. The essay style was a bit inconsistent at times, but still, an easy read. I was disappointed at the overall Christian tone of this book, which I did not expect nor want, and felt it was kind of preachy.A better, more hilariously humorous read is Julie Donner Andersen's ""Parentally Insane: Insights From The Edge..of Midlife!"", which covers the gamut of midlife pains and joys of raising children (and babies!) in midlife, physical changes, and midlife marriage."
5,Cheers from a Middle Aged Mom,"This is only the second book that I have read in the last six months since I became a Mom. I couldn't put it down. I haven't hit menopause yet, but pregnancy hormones were similar and I feel like I have a better handle on what is to come. The stories were full of the fragilty and humor of life. The comments from other ladies at the end of each section were great. It was nice to hear from such a cross section of lives. Thank you Caron for being so transparent and vulnerable and to allow us to walk through this phase of life WITH you."
2,"cute, but broke after 6 months","I wore them often (maybe once a week), but still. Tried to super glue them, but didn't work."
3,"good, but not compatible with later ipods",I this device worked well with 3G ipods but not compatible with later models.
4,Photo transfers,I guess I was hoping to be able to see the photos on the i-pod immediately following the transfer from camera to i-pod. Other thanthat it did everything it claimed to do and nothing was lost in thetransfer. Very easy to use. Very good piece of equipment especiallyif you like to take a lot of photos and space on camera or cards islimited.
3,Use it for emergency storage,"On a multi-day photo shoot, it's good to be able to transfer your photos from flash cards to your 3G iPod. The process is simple enough, but it's slow, very heavy on batteries, including the iPod itself, and you can't tell how many of the photos are processed until the process is complete.But other than that, yes, it does move photos to the iPod directly from a camera, or a flash card reader."
1,didn't work at all :(,"I bought Belkin Digital Camera Link a few months ago and put it aside. When I finally tried to use it .. nothing. It's defective. I doesn't work AT ALL. And I'm not surprised bec. this is the 2nd time this has happened to me with a Belkin for ipod product (the other one was the fm transmitter). And, my daughter has the belkin battery backup for ipod .. and it also stopped working after less than 1 year. I refuse to buy another Belkin product!"
5,a great quick reference for common questions,"This book is a follow-up to the original How Come? book. The book is broken up into four main parts: questions about the earth, animals, the body, and how things are made. Each question is answered in just a few pages and includes cartoon pictures and fast facts. There is an index at the end of the book.This is a great book to pick up and put down over and over. All questions were submitted by kids, which makes it appealing to young readers. The questions are common ones that kids are always asking, like why it looks like there is a man on the moon and why dogs bark. Now they can find the answers themselves! It is an easy reader and the pictures are really cute. Even older students would enjoy this book because it is long so it does not look like a children's book and it answers the types of questions that kids of all ages ask. This would be a nice book for a classroom where students could pick it up and look through it little by little."
5,use of non toxic spray for my fruits and vegetables,I need to get this spray for white flies and it seems to work. I know that I am not adding poison to my yard.
3,Can't change her clothes easily!,"This doll was really pretty to start with......but I can't change her clothes freely!the coat was attached with the shirt,and I can't take her clothes off with that coat blocking it.....But I like her shoes and pants.....They could have worked more on the details.....but still a good doll if girls like that fashion!Hope this helps...Barbie Fan"
2,authenic pigment tee shirt,"The tee shirt (Authentic Pigment 94% Ring Spun Cotton & 6% Organic Ring Spun Cotton) was nothing like the Authentic Pigment (Ring Spun Cotton) tee shirts I saw while shopping in Leelanau, MI earlier this summer. I was truly disappointed with the tee shirt I ordered through Amazon. The shirt was very skimpily made and left me leary of doing business with Amazon again."
1,"I wouldn't Know, I never recieved the DVD...and nobody ever got intouch with me...very Disapointed with this company....won't be","they never e-mailed me to rectify any resources, thankfully I got my money back through Amazon. won't ever use this company again and plan to let my other buyer friends know how they treat customers, never even apologized for any inconvience...never again"
4,Not Quite Complete,"This compilation presents a pretty good overview of Terry Hall's early career. The music itself is all wonderful. I do have a couple of quibbles, though. First: I don't understand why ""Really Saying Something"" is included. It's a Bananarama song with some backing vocals from the Fun Boy Three. There so many other songs that would have been more appropriate. Second: the copyright date on this is 2001 yet there is nothing from the two solo albums Hall did in the 1990s or Vegas, his collaboration with Dave Stewart. Such omissions make the name ""The Complete Terry Hall"" quite a misnomer. Perhaps they should have called it ""The Early Terry Hall"". Still, Terry Hall has got to be one of the most underrated performers out there and this is a good way to sample his early work. Well worth the money."
5,"OK, so what is the deal with this being out of print?","I simply do not understand why this fabulous film is out of print. It's a wonderful slice of American (and in my case, family) history and it's a whole lot of fun. With all the shows on cable right now that pretend to celebrate Cajun and Louisiana culture, one would think that this film would be back in print. Robert Duvall, are you listening? Because you know as well as I do that this needs to be in print, and not just in VHS."
5,Time Travel Feud,This film is like a step back in time. The background of a culture lost is a belivable setting for a great adventure and love story. The music is lively cajun style and the terrific camera work puts you right in the middle of things. Robert Redford had his hand in making a film of a tale that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.
4,Long time favorite!,"This is one movie I watch over and over. I love that it covers a part of American history that most of us do not know, I love the language, the actors, the plot and the music by Michael Doucet."
3,Pentagon Wars,Bought for a specific purpose to illustrate uncontrolled scope and spending in the absence of using project management practices. Used in a Project Management exam prep class.
5,Excellant,I bought this DVD a couple of years ago and STILL watch it. It makes me even more cynical of the way the Pentagon works but does it in such a comical way. I highly recommend this movie.
5,HBO blows the lid off corrupt military spending!,"One of the best true stories HBO has ever dared to tackle! It follows the amazing trials and tribulations of Air Force Colonel Burton (Carey Elwes)appointed by congress to oversee the corrupt testing and mired developement of the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle. However, Army General Partridge (Kelsey Grammer)will do anything to keep Burton from learning the truth in an absurd attempt to push an unsafe, untested and faulty vehicle into production. Smart, hilarious and clever, HBO skillfully took this outrageous story and made it into one of the best comedies it has ever done!"
4,"Funny, Entertaining and Great Acting!","I saw this movie when it first aired on HBO and I bought it recently because I am a Richard Schiff fan. This movie tells the tale of a military colonel (Cary Elwes) who is put in charge of a Pentagon project to build a new tank. Elwes is the most recent in a long line of men who have overseen this boondoggle since 1968. Kelsey Grammar plays the General who just wants the damn thing built despite any problems that it may have. He forces his underlings to falsify test results and even tries to get Elwes fired. Schiff, who has a fair amount of screen time, plays the original project director who never fought against the big guns, but still opposes the tank because of its design flaws. He helps Elwes get to the truth. Lots of fun!"
3,This is disgusting!,Not the movie--- it's great! Just the thematic material and how true it's likely to be. Oh woe is us!
5,The Truth on DoD purchases,The movie is the story of the development of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and why things never seem to work the way they were intended. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen showing how NOT to do project management.
3,"Great Movie, but case broken",Pentagon Wars is a great movie with an all-star cast. Unfortunately the clip that holds the disc in the case was broken in shipping and the disk terminally scratched. I got to watch the first 10 minutes though...
4,All too true in the military,"When I first saw this movie on HBO my jaw just hit the floor like a bowling ball. I was just an aspiring Private in the Army and in the Infantry working directly with the Bradley Vehicle no less and to see this sort of thing going on in Washington made me think twice about what I was doing and who I was working with. Can't believe that if it wasn't for this Air Force Col., casualties in the Gulf War would have been higher. The movie is great and I recommend that everyone should see it, have a good laugh and thank those soldiers who risk their lives not only against a possible enemy but with the equipment they work with."
5,"Sturdy, well-made slipper perfect for Mets fan","My dad loved these slippers, though they were a bit small when he tried them on with socks. Otherwise, they were fine, warm and comfy with a rubber bottom. Arrived in a nice box, perfect for wrapping. I would definitely purchase another Reebok slipper from Amazon."
4,Good gift for NY Mets fans,"Comfortable, attractive, seems durable. The New York Mets fan who received it as a gift loved it. Unfortunately, they pick up lint easily. They require a quick cleaning with a lint brush after one or two wearings."
2,A Minaturist with a Small World of Provincial Feelings,"There's nothing compelling in either the language or the subject matter herein. Zulauf is a lazy observer of life who lacks orginality and zest. His work is both provincial and predictable. No great poetic grace or originality. Life in a small town with a few hard knocks and longings. Not awful, but not very interesting poetry and rather provincial in both tone and concern. I'd call this little booklet, his only poetic output, okay, but nothing to write home about."
3,"Decent album, not great.","I remember when this album was released and so many people were raving about it. I had only heard ""Alternations"" on a nuphonic compilation, but had not heard the rest of the album until now.Now that i'm hearing it, I don't see what all the fuss was about. It's decent but it fails to move my soul."
4,great starter doll house,"My daughter loves this doll house, and so do I! It folds up to a nice, compact size for easy storage in her room, and it is well-designed. It seems to be quite durable, and it is beautiful. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I wish the rooms were a bit larger and the ceilings a bit higher (the heads of the people almost touch the ceilings). Also, I wish it had come with more furniture, but this way it is a gift that keeps on giving because we can just keep adding to it."
3,"My daughter loves this house, BUT rooms are too small","This is our 2nd house- we upgraded to the twintime. My daughter is 4 and she loves it, although she uses her animals and such rather than the family and furniture. Great house with all the features and the foldup feature. The only problem is that the rooms in this version are too small for the furniture! Furniture is hard to position and once you get it in- there is no room for little hands to move the people or other furniture about.I think if I had to do it over again, I might invest in a larger house. Something to consider."
1,reviewing ONLY the marketing; NOT the product,"Be aware that only on the box does this item state each sheet is ONE SIDED ONLY. So a box of 50 sheets only covers 25 pages. I was completely unaware of this, and there was NO information on the Amazon Product Details list about this either. When buying this box I was led to believe I would be able to cover 50 sheets of paper, (as stated as 50 sheets in the box) and did my price comparison using that data.I am looking forward to using this product. BUT I am a firm believer that ALL information should be made well known."
4,ok,"I enjoy the CLEAR sheets. The item I am reviewing is the non-glare. I tried the ones that were non-glare and I did not like them as much for pictures. I use the CLEAR sheets to cover pictures that we carry in our wallets, use for bookmarks, small projects around the office, etc. I also tried the laminating pouches which did not work well for this purpose. This is the second time I ordered them."
2,Not as good as they used to be,"I bought exactly the same item a few years ago. It's only about half the thickness of the previous sheets, but they still call them ""heavyweight"". Now, each sheet (without the backing) is about half the thickness it used to be, or maybe even less than half. It's even thinner than the plastic shipping tape I use to seal boxes with.Also, this same item used to be a full 9"" by 12"". They still are, sort of. There is a line across one end to indicate which side is the easiest to separate, so it makes 1/2 inch of each sheet unuseable unless you don't mind the line being there.I only bought these because I didn't want to take a chance on any of the other brands that I don't have any experience with, and these were okay the last time. Now I wish I had tried one of the other, cheaper brands."
5,Another great deal form Amazon.,I've used these laminating sheets for many years for protecting vending machine labels which I make on the computer. They work great without the expense and hassle of a laminating machine. As usual the service and price from Amazon were unbeatable.
5,great service,I was amazed with how quickly my order arived.I would order other items from this seller!
4,kicked out,"I had found these back in Sturgis of 02, loved them, wore to restaraunt and was asked to leave for not having shoes on, well i showed them! still have them, just for show, don't stick well after 6yrs.stick them in clean plastic bag. dog hair and sand are problematic but mine are still sticky."
3,Temporary Satisfaction,"Work as advertised, can become a one-time-use item. Once you take them off, you have to keep them separate from everything as they will stick. It is difficult to keep them clean, I wore them on the cruise ship and got some great laughs but thats it. You could not use these in the sandy, dirty areas."
1,don't waste your money,"I thought these would be a great idea since I recently had the tops of both feet tattooed, so I ordered two pair. I wore one pair to work for about 4 hours and the adhesive came off the shoe in large areas. It was enough that I couldn't wear them the next day. I figured maybe I just got a defective pair so I wore the second pair out to a local club. I was only wearing them for about 2 hours and I was sitting for most of that time. The adhesive came off of them as well. The second pair also made my feet sweat so that they came off my feet constantly. I also wanted to say that you do feel the adhesive the entire time you wear these shoes. I wouldn't recommend these for anyone."
3,"Not as good as the first one, but Shannon still sizzles","""Animal Instincts 2"" doesn't quite measure up to the standard set by the first ""Animal Instincts"" (again, get the unrated VHS version; the DVD version has been substantially cut), but Shannon Whirry still puts your video system at serious risk of burnout whenever she appears on the screen!"
1,a total bust!,"if you were expecting something like animal instincts, for get it. it is like buying a box of your favorite cereal and you find out there is nothing in the box......bummer"
3,Rubber stamping,"This book is not among my favorite resource books, but did provide some inspiration and knowledge."
5,Moonwarriors,"This is a novel that you just can't put down. From beginning to end it keeps you enthralled. Brilliantly written in everyway possible. The tale of Walter Volknor and his comrades is amazing. This is by far the best fantasy novel I have read for some time. If your fascination is werewolves versus vampires, then look no further! Moonwarriors will take your imagination on an adventure that you will never forget. It is definately a MUST READ!"
5,Awesome Werewolf book...,"First of all, I am truly happy to know ""Moonwarriors"" author Rusty Nugent and just by getting to know him, I could tell this would be a very compelling and compassionate book. I loved the book to pieces. I thought the characters were very strong and I especially like the fact that he introduced us to a very strong heroine, Mary. I could not put the book down. I wanted it to go on so I could read as to what happens to the surviving characters but look forward to his next novel. Anyone who wants to read a really awesome book about Werewolves vs. Vampires, pick this one up. It will be worth the time."
3,Doesn't work for everyone,"Evaluate your child's personality before buying this. I have heard that it works like a charm for other kids, but my daughter is just too active and direct intervention works better than time-outs. I do like its main message--don't let your kids walk all over you and don't be afraid to discipline (positively, not spanking). If you feel your child will respond to time-outs, this is a good resource. However, I found the Positive Discipline series to be more effective for my child."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I suspect other genealogists would be as disappointed as I am with this book. It is a very thin volume and skimpy on detail.A far superior alternative is Martha McCartney's recent ""Virginia Immigrants and Adventurers, 1607-1635: A Biographical Dictionary."""
3,So-so,Maybe I didn't read the description correctly. But for some reason I thought this would be more than just a list of names. I will keep it for now but will be more careful in the future. Seems like a lot of money to pay for a list I could have printed off from several free on-line sites.
2,Jamestowne,"Arrived on time as agreed. Intersting book but not as useful as I had thought it might be. Still, for Virginia genealogists, put it on the shelf; you might have use for it from time to time."
5,America's anniversary addition,"This is an attractive edition, and I'm glad it is the400 year Anniversary Edition. I already knew what was in the book,just wanted an additional proven source for my genealogy works."
5,excelente interpretación.,"LA INTERPRETACION DE MANFREDO FEST A LA MUSICA DE JOBIM ES DIGNA DEL GRAN COMPOSITOR BRASILEÑO, DUEÑO DE UNA GRAN TECNICA PIANISTICA, SU APORTACION A CANCIONES YA TAN CONOCIDAS, ES DESLUMBRANTE, LLENA DE INNOVACION Y RITMO. UNA OBRA MAESTRA, SIN DUDA ALGUNA."
2,"Sorry, but this poacher fails for the following reasons:","1. When I first washed the glass lid, soapy water collected in the empty space under the handle. You could turn it over and see the suds but couldn't get them out. In use, the stuff expanded and dripped out. The solution is to wash by hand and not submerge it.2. A steam escape hole is between each of pair of poaching cups. Because they're small, five jets of steam shoot out at high pressure. I use tongs to lift the cups out to avoid scalding. If I had designed it, I would have put a large hole in the center to reduce the pressure and the number of jets.3. The ball handles on the poaching cups are threaded and if not regularly tightened can become loose, allowing a hot cup to rotate and burn you.With these exceptions, it's an otherwise fine product. But in my opinion, a poaching pan this expensive should be better designed."
2,Eggs Stick,"Even though the cups were throughly oiled, the eggs still stuck. The little knobs attached to the egg cups got very hot and wet so it was difficult to remove them from the insert, even with a potholder. Don't waste your money."
5,Makes great poached eggs,"I bought this and have been using it to make poached eggs for eggs benedict... at tailgates (hey, when I'm at the stadium at 9:30am before the early game on sunday, I'm more in the mood for breakfast/brunch stuff than steaks and bbq).This pan/rack/cup set works great! Follow the directions and you have no worries. Spray some Pam or something like that, and you won't have any sticking issues.I do have to give a couple of warnings though...First, you won't be able to just pull the cups/tray out with your bare hands... the handles can get hot and/or the steam will get you.Second, make sure all knobs are thoroughly screwed in before use. Otherwise, you will get some spinning action with the cups, as noted by one review I read.Other than these two notes, this set has been fantastic! Happy cooking!"
5,S.S. egg poacher,It's quality heavy metal construction.I would have preferred a 3-hole but had to settle for the weighty 5-hole.
5,No more toxic smell on my eggs.,I recently purchased a brand name an egg poacher from a local kitchen and bath store. The egg cups were made of plastic and the first time I used it there was a toxic smell when I removed the top. The egg had a strange taste. It was an American company but the product was made in China. I never poached an egg since. Then I purchased the Norpro Krona. The cups are made of stainless steel and the grips are bakelite. The cups are easy to clean and there's no toxic smell when you poach an egg.
5,Great Egg Poacher,Used A Lot Of Different Poachers In My Time But This One Is Really The Best I've Ever Used. Will Recommend This To Any One Looking For A Poacher
4,Therapists: Want to Find Out About Coaching?,"I especially like the Try It! sections throughout the chapters. This book has a clear, practical approach. The four sections are: coaching, the difference between therapy and coaching, professional transitional tools, and coaching specialties. Author Pat Williams is well known and respected in the field, as the founder of The Institute for Life Coaching, a training program designed for mental health practitioners who want to add or transition to coaching."
5,A Must for any Coach - not just Practice Building Therapists!,"This is a truly extraordinary book that gives the reader a guide to the profession of life coaching.It is an eyeopening source of information, not only for the business of coaching, but also for the development of their relationships with clients as well as themselves.Chock full of resources and tools, this A MUST HAVE!"
5,One of the most powerful scores I've ever heard....,"When I first saw this movie I knew immediately afterwards that I had to buy the score to it. This is the most powerful and haunting music I think I have heard in my entire life. The soundtrack for ""Pi"" was extremely good music, but this score is just so amazing and has such a strong unique sound to it. I can't get it out of my head. I'm glad the are directors like Darren Aronofsky around and he writes his own stuff (well he wrote ""Pi"" himself, but he co-wrote ""Requiem For A Dream"" with Hubert Selby Jr.) but anyways, I think this is one of the best things I've ever heard and I just wanted to say that"
4,high music,"While a i was watching the movie i thought ""i gotta buy this soundtrack"" and i did. The music in the CD appears just like in the movie and that's the problem, you won't find a full track in this cd, there are 30 songs that can be 3 in time. That's why i gave it 4 stars instead 5. But, if you liked the movie you can take it. Anyway, it's a great cd, the songs are truly intense and the strings arrengements are spectacular. You won't regret it."
3,powerful stuff,"This is a good soundtrack no doubt, but the music just doesn't have the same impact on the eardrum and soul when it's separated from the graphic images from the film (which by the way remain scorched onto my retina to this day). Still, it's some intense classical if there's such a thing. Just don't play it for your girlfriend if you're trying to cheer her up."
3,Violins Galore,"This entire piece is really quite haunting after you've seen the movie. Anyone who has seen this film will recognize 'Winter: Lux Aeterna', for it is the song that plays during the downfall of every character at the end of the film. It is a chilling, beautiful piece, with sorrowful violins and easily conveys a loss of hope.The rest of the music is similar. You will be truly affected if you have seen the film, but even if you have not, the scores do invoke vivid emotions and imagery.For fans of the movie, or for fans of well composed scores."
3,Definitely Interesting . . .,"I saw the movie itself about a month ago and, though I think I liked it (still not quite sure), the music was what really struck me. It's haunting- especially the theme that keeps popping up. A weird mix of the brilliant Kronos Quartet and what sounds like computer generated sound effects. I use it a lot for background music because, besides the theme, there's hardly anything solid to hang on to or hum. I recently had to write a lengthy essay on a poem by Sylvia Plath and engrossed myself in this soundtrack for three straight days because it is probably the most depressing sounding music that I have. Anyway, I think the paper turned out well . . .All in all, definitely interesting. Like the movie, it leaves a haunting after-taste."
1,Reqium for a Dream.,Only a couple of tracks that are actually music. Most of the Album is snippets of backround sound. The short samples provided seem to hide this. Do not recommend.
3,depressingly beautiful,"Kronos Quartet is amazing as usual. Summer is fun, fall starts to get a little sad-feeling, and Winter strait makes you want to kill yourself. Not good-to-fall-asleep-to-kind-of-music, but a good CD nonetheless."
3,WILD AND WIERD,This movie was really a complete mind blowing experience. It should be the poster movie of why not to do herion. Showing what addiction to anything can do and what it will bring you to. Somewhat a love story and very sad for all the characters involed.
1,Not what you think it is...,"For anyone who has heard the ""primary"" piece (Lux Aetera) by Masell via Youtube or some other source on the internet, be aware that the full song is *NOT* on this DVD - and most of the DVD is terrible, synthesized trash that doesn't flow or sound good at all.If anyone knows where to get the full song that I'm hearing used in movie trailers, on Youtube, and elsewhere, please post and let me know ;-) as I love the full song."
2,Ugh...,"After hearing this score, I felt like throwing up. Almost all of it is pointless electronic garbage. One 20-second-long track is actually just three slow, electronic beeps played one after the other. I felt nothing after hearing this soundtrack. The only tracks on this album that are worth listening to are the overtures. But even they are boring; each one uses the same dreary theme over again. It starts to sound like the composer Clint Mansell is on the same drugs that characters in the movie use. Only get this soundtrack if you love techno/electronica music. Clint Mansell's effort to be original for this soundtrack failed horribly. Don't waste your money."
5,Requiem for a Dream (sound track),I listened to the soundtrack at a friends house and was amazed by the powerful sounds...those violins continued to play in my head for days afterward. I was finally able to watch the movie and I was extremly impressed. I recommend this to anyone who likes powerful music. It is also wonderful to dance to!
4,Reliable recording but artwork on front is a little busy,"These disks record well (haven't had any ""coasters"" yet). The only thing I don't like is that they have printed artwork on the front with logos, the image of a man listening to music, etc. It's just a screened image so you can write over it but it would be easier to read if it were blank. Still, for cheap CDs they're fine; I'd buy them again."
5,"Atmospheric, Provocative","Empty City shows us that the road to rebirth and revitalization -- of city and of self -- is the antithesis of clean, suburban predictability. The descriptions in Mr. Shapiro's debut novel paint word pictures and evoke the sound of truth."
4,An Intimate Look At Panama's Last Great Dictator,"I was deeply impressed by the in depth coverage of the dastardly deeds what was perhaps Panama last great dictator. I was extremely surprised at how Noreiga cleverly manipulated the Great South American Flying Train to smuggle illegal contraband over international waters. Sadly the fate of this great man lied on the 80's song ""We're Not Going to Take It"" as the general, who was by the time the seige was over only a shell of the former tyrant he had been, was forced into submission. I would have rated this documentary a five, had it not so awkardly and obviously avoided mentioning the suspected possible connection and accomplice General Thomas ""Chavez"" Hinds. It was almost as though the author was attempting to cover up some horrible truth."
1,Decline of quality,"His work has gone down, in my opinion, since Death Row Records lost Tupac, and Dre's producing/rapping skills. Dre and Snoop complimented each other, and on the same note, Dre hasn't been the same since leaving Death Row Records specially his homie Snoop."
2,Was ok,As a regular thermometer it was decent but when used as a rectal it didn't fit properly. I suggest buying a smaller one.
2,Not a true V,"The tip of this bit is rounded a small amount. Thus, it does not cut a true V groove. So it was useless for my particular application at the moment. I will keep it for other operations in the future. Get true V groove bits from other manufacturers."
5,Worship Music Lover,"This worship music is so anointed that it has taken me into a spirit of worship that I can not get out of and I don't want to get out of, Praise God!"
1,Disappointing,"This album was an utter disappointment. It was definitely one of the most superficial sounding church oriented c.d.'s I've ever heard in my life. These people would not know a move of the Holy Ghost if He slapped em across the fo head. Carlton's albums have definitely lost something, spirit. Stick to Azusa 1, 2, and 3 and you'll be alright."
3,A Nice Collection of Snapshots,"I would like to say that anyone interested in C.G. Jung's writings would also probably enjoy this book. It seems to me that the major flaw in this ILLUSTRATED biography is an artistic one. The reproductions of photographs are generally poor, but there ARE some very good ones here. Some wonderful little snapshots could have been much larger, and some of the large pictures could have been much smaller. However, there are many things to recommend this book as well. There are the very nice pictures of the tower at Bollingen - - there are the paintings and mandalas by Jung himself -- the biography is concise and quite good. I wish that everything had been done as well as the dust jacket photo of Jung."
4,Historical and Erotic,This is a great erotic story with lots of historical content. If you like roman history and feel not enough books cover the sexual part of it. Read this piece of fiction.
4,English French Dictionary,An excellent reference book although it's lacking in some slang words that would be helpful when reading modern works.
2,Are you qualified?,"The premise here is that one can do both personal and executive coaching. If you want to find out if you qualify to be an EXECUTIVE coach, look at the NEW page where you can connect to a competency model: theexecutivecoachingforum.com"
3,Good concert but....,"Good concert but the DVD is not produced in the U.S. and in this case it will not play on all DVD players. I had to order two and neither one played without skipping and jumping. Ordered from two different dealers with same results. It's a coin toss if it will play or not. Besides that, I love Chic and if you luck out will love this concert."
4,a good read,"Shadows and Light is one of another trilogy by Anne Bishop. I find her writing compelling, multitextured and very enjoyable. Although I wouldn't recommend her books for children or preteens due to some of the subject matter I have thoroughly enjoyed them."
5,I am a fan.,"The reason I picked up this book is because I really loved Bishop's Dark Jewels series. Even though, I wanted her to go back to the Dark Jewel world, I was pretty happy that she was still writing.This book about a the Fae and country witches was intriguing. I hate to use a cliche, but I couldn't put it down. If you like well-written fantasy, you'll love it too. I want more."
3,Ehh,"Bishop's main characters have shifted in this book. You get introduced to more characters as well as learning more about those mentioned in passing in the first book. Her world building is excellent, writing is great, but again, I still don't like what she turned some characters into. For example, Lucian and Dianna."
4,Wry Tacoma memoir of pioneer Northwest,"Memoir of a young Yale graduate who headed west in the 1880s, with a stake from his New England family in his pocket, to build his way in industry and claim his fortune in the pioneering Nortwest -- and to set out on his own, away from that New England family -- only to nearly go broke in his Tacoma lumber mill during the Depression of the 1890s.Ripley has a wry, wistful tone that sets this book in fond-memoir land. It gives a wonderful view into early Puget Sound life (e.g. Ivar's ""Keep Clam"" motto comes from an 1890's Depression song ""Acres of Clams"" -- ""When the tide is out, my table's set""), and into the Yankee industriousness (shown here through its slacker son) that built so much of the country.It's a lively story, well told and highly insightful. Recommended."
3,Nothing Special,"This rack needed several modifications before it was usable on my Ford E350 full size van. The rain gutters stick out a full inch from the roof, so there's plenty to hold onto. The plastic feet had thin plastic pads that slip on to protect the paint. The pads kept falling off so I ended up taping them on. The plastic caps that fit over the steel tubes also had to be taped. Lastly, the hooks that secure the rack to the roof kept slipping off the gutters. I had to bend them with pliers then wedge a small piece of wood under them to make them hold firmly. Now that's its secure it can handle my car top carrier. However, I'm not sure if I'd trust it to carry large bulky items like ladders or lumber."
1,Good Product Non-Existant customer Service,"I STILL do not have a usable roof rack. (about 3 weeks after the partial delivery.) The box arrived damaged - there are 2 essential pieces missing. I have called the company several times, and each time after I have worked through the phone tree I was hung up on. Without ever having spoken with a person. They have a web based notification process. But, so far it has been one sided. The only thing that they seem to have done with it is to mark my claim low priority, and then mark it closed. It is not closed. I thought that they might have shipped the two missing parts; but I have no way of knowing if they have or not. I hope to get this resolved. But I do not see me dealing with AutoBarn again."
1,tough guys,"what a joke. they sell this to people in US and it wont even play in DVD player. wrong format and country, very unhappy"
2,No use of the item,I was unable to play the movie. Unfortunately I do not have any device that plays the movie. There's no use for it.
1,i had no clue region mattered,"i never knew region mattered. if you are from the united states then do not buy this item. it will not play on your dvd player, and although it isnt personally anyones fault but mine that i bought it, i am extremely disappointed with this purchase."
3,Regional error,"The movie is ""tough guys"" I have to play it on my desktop. when I try to play it on my sony dvd player it won't play the screen says region error. I own over 400 movies,this is a new one on me ,but the movie is great"
1,Don't Buy if you live in USA,"Tough guy Region 2, is not rated for the united states. If you use a dvd player in the USA, it will NOT PLAY. It will say, wrong region. So please don't be fooled like I was."
1,Not Happy,"When I ordered this item - it said region 2 - I thought that this meant postal info. However, it means that this dvd will not work on my player. My mistake and no refund. This is the first item that I ever ordered from Amazon that I am not happy with.Buyer beware!!!!!!!"
1,tough guys,"Could not even watch the dvd because it was a region 2 product,it is'nt worth returning after paying the shipping cost.Vendors should make it very clear to customers that these will not work in the U.S.A. I would still like to know where I can buy the correct type. My purchase was from Movie Mars."
1,Tough Guys,After I bought it it would not play. After further scrutiny i realized it was for foriegn markets. For My stupity I just thru it away. Tony Merendino
4,Eli Wallach steals the show with his cameo role,"I have to say I do love this movie, it's pretty cool to see two aging ex-cons having trouble adjusting to society after a long stint in prison for robbing a train in their youth. Finding out the place they used to hang out at has been turned into a gay bar, trying to keep a job and causing a riot at an old folks home are all really cool. The two (Lancaster and Douglas) play their hearts out in this movie, too bad it was their last together.Even though it was great to see the gruesome twosome working together again in a comedy, it was Eli Wallach (of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" fame) who stole the film for me as the blundering and also aging Hitman, Leon B. Little, who with his sarcasm, lack of good vision and shotgun provides the best humour. If anything, it is worth watching for his antics alone.-agp"
4,Reason Enuff to Stay on The Straight and Narrow....,"...the way these two old cons are treated by the rest of society when they get out is criminal. Folks barking orders at you like you can't understand, the nursing home becomes more prison like than prison itself. And the new styles and fashion? Way too much lame (La-may). It's no wonder a pair of ol' tommygun criminals don't mind risking it all to take the train that they heisted years back again. After the thrill of seeing this pair of classic con actors reunited then the story is maintained by their delightful chemistry, the supporting cast--Eli Wallach, Dana Carvey and Charles Durning--and the fact that you start rooting for these thugs because you think, 'Hey, I ain't exactly a teenager, anymore, and what they're saying and doing makes a lot of sense.' It is an enjoyable flick in the vein of Grumpy Old Men."
1,This is the worst item I've ever purchased.,"My husband and I couldn't wait to receive this DVD, IT DOES NOT PLAY ON ANY OF OUR EQUIPMENT. AN EXPLANATION FROM THE COMPANY WAS POOR, APPARANTLY DVD AND BLU RAY PLAYERS ARE CODED FOR REGIONS, OURS IS NOT IN A REGION THAT THIS DVD WILL PLAY. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF MOVIES AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. I SUGGEST YOU ELIMINATE THEM FROM YOUR CLIENT BASE. I AM NOW STUCK WITH A MOVIE I WILL NEVER SEE.I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW THAT THIS DVD WAS REGION SPECIFIC (whatever that means).CR"
2,Not as good as others for beginners,"I did not find this book nearly as usueful as I had hoped. I ended up returning it. It was too abstract and not concise enough for a beginner. It might be good for an intermediate experienced thrower. A better book for beginners isThrown Pottery Techniques Revealed: The Secrets of Perfect Throwing Shown in Unique Cutaway Photographyby Mary Chappelhow. Mary's book did a much better job of covering all the details, step by step in a more comprehensible manner, which I found to be excedingly more helpful for a beginner."
2,Disappointing,Magnetix products always end up disappointing us - the magnets are fun for 30 minutes then you realize that you can't build that many different things unless you buy lots and lots of packages.
1,Worthless item,"I would have given this shaver zero stars, but that wasn't an option.It never worked; arrived defective."
5,Should be required reading from the age one begins reading,"If this were just required reading in school, we might have moderately well-mannered citizens. Miss Manners does it again, with excruciatingly correct advice on conversation, dress, deportment, correspondence, entertaining and general comportment from cradle to grave. Kudos to Ms. Martin for another worthy attempt at maintaining civilization in a world that's fast losing it."
3,"An old, old fashioned read.","Take your mind back half a century and read these mildly amusing essays about life in the 1920s and 1930s. The style is so different from modern prose, but it is well worth the read."
4,Dated but funny still,"In a kinder and gentler age (if ever there was one), MLHT was doubtless considered very funny. Indeed, the book has its moments even today. By and large, however, it is slim in every sense of the word. As a lighthearted bit of nostalgia reflecting upon an America and upon sensibilities that, alas, are no more, it is well-worth the read. And one can expect the occasional laugh, too. Thurber is fun. But judging from MLHT alone, he's no Twain."
5,Oustanding!,"This was a very funny book, not crude at all, and absolutely the kind of writing that should have never gone ""out of style."" I have read many different kinds of books by the most varied group of writers, and this definitely is a book that must be read by any serious reader."
2,Great Book - Terrible Printing - Do Not Buy,"I love this book and wanted to buy a copy for a friend for Xmas. I'm glad I leafed through it because the pages have a grey cross-hatching behind the text that makes it difficult to read. I don't know if this was meant as a design feature (bad idea) or is just a bad print job. I think it's the latter because the cross-hatching isn't consistent from page to page, darker on some pages than on others. I can't give it as a gift, even as a stocking-stuffer. Just to be clear, the publisher is HarperPerennial. Do not buy from this publisher. Do read this book - just get another printing."
4,Fast & Funny,"This is a quick and pleasant read by a famous humorist. Want something light to read on a plane? or if youhave to wait in an office? or maybe on your commute (not if you're driving, of course)? Read the chapterssequentially or not, makes no difference. People around you will wonder why you're chuckling."
3,I was looking for hard laughs,"Recently watched the documentary ""Public Speaking"" featuring conversations wih Fran Lebowitz. She said Thurber was the funniest writer...ever! So, having just read another hilarious read by David Sedaris, I began. That must have been my mistake....reading Sedaris first. Because this did not seem funny to me...didn't read a whole lot, so this doesn't qualify as a spot on review...but I'm looking for funny right now..I NEED funny right now, and this didn't fit the bill."
4,Very disturbing movie...,"Flawed yet nonetheless powerful movie. Diane Keaton's acting is humanely touching. She portrays the characters imperfections with such vulnerability, which makes the ending all the more powerful and chilling... The last scene is cinematography at its finest (got an oscar for it) And the last image left me very disturbed....."
3,You've got to read the book or you won't get the movie,"The movie leaves out a lot of explanation as far as what's going on and why the characters do the things they do. You really can't ""get it"" without knowing the story. She's not just an immature barfly--she's really got problems! I think the movie visually captures the mood of the book, but it leaves out way too much detail."
4,...and the pursuit of happiness,"On its best level, ""Mr. Goodbar"" showed the audience how you can be an intelligent, cultured and sensitive person and yet become a tragic figure, a victim of circumstance.The Keaton character realizes the entity of her own sexual frustration and takes to casual sex as a form of emotional therapy. When she decides it's time to get her act straight, she fails, fatally, to put her experience to fruition: not because it's morally too late for redemption and she must be punished, but simply out of bad luck.I don't think Brooks had a 'this is what you're going to get if you stray from the straight and narrow' agenda. I have a feeling he was more interested in the intrinsic tragic potential of being human."
2,Doesn't compare to the book,"I just finished reading the book and loved it. I thought I'd watch the movie also. As is normally the case, the movie just can't give you all the details that the book does. The characters are so much more complex than the movie is able to convey. If I hadn't read the book, maybe I'd think more highly of the movie. But knowing all the details that were left out just made it a little hard to watch. The movie retains the main story line from the book, changes little things, but in the end, simply doesn't measure up to the book."
3,To 'Glad I missed the 70's',"I think it's quite rude to state what happened at the end when most people coming here do so to buy the film, not to have the ending spoiled. If they wanted to know that they would have gone to a spoiler site."
4,Deliberately Disturbing,"Yes, there are faults with the film and it is dated (for some, that might be a recommendation), but Keaton is extrodinary and it was a wonderful introduction to/of Gere as an actor of merit. The story was quite controversial at the time of release, and even today remains with you. It's stylestically and politically representative of it's time/generation. Like the old train wreck adage, you just can't look away as it unfolds."
2,Slow depressing movie about sex & drugs in the late 70's,"Depressing look into the life of a girl who doesn't know what she wants in her life, other than to be free, and not understanding what free is. Diane Keaton does a good job, but the movie leaves one depressed and wondering why they just wasted 2 hours watching it."
2,Great acting - terrible story!,"This is really a very sad, sad story. I remember watching it and thinking at the end, ""This really sucks!"" I won't give away the entire plot, but if you can think of a woman in her 20's, with a job at a school (so she should be leading a somewhat low key life) and tons of men that treated her like crap, then this is your flick! The worst part must be the ending. Some movies, you suffer through the whole thing, and then you get a really good ending .... but this one, you just get a crappy story with an even crappier ending. As much as I love Diane Keaton, and her acting is great by the way, this movie is a real downer. If you are in the mood to get depressed, watch this one!"
5,Please release on DVD or BluRay soon!!!,I have a handful of films I am still waiting to come out on digital format. This is high on the list!
3,Not Hot - BUT I Still Love Wendy!,"I am a Wendy Williams fan. I could not wait to read this book. It was a page turner, but afterwards...it left me asking where was the heat. Wendy exposed herself in a tasteful manner. She dished her own dirt just as she does for the celebrities...but she provided more info than necessary on her drug use. Now the area that she treaded lightly on was her husband's infidelity. Wendy could have exposed a lot about the other woman, especially since she hired a private detective, but she was stingy with details or just took the high road.Wendy covers a lot of territory in this book. Overall this was a good book and I can't wait to see the movie. Females interested in the radio/broadcasting field must read this book."
4,Awesome!!!,Wendy did a great job writing this book... Details she describes is hard to admit & she just let it all out!
3,A Story About Wendy's Life,"I enjoyed ""Wendy's Got The Heat"" to a degree. The book would be an especially good read for a woman who is thinking about a career in radio broadcasting because Wendy details her journey to the top. What I didn't like about the book was Wendy's constant discussion of her drug use. It got to be very boring after awhile. The part of the book that I found the most revealing was Wendy's in depth discussion about her struggles to conceive and the tragedies she faced along the road to motherhood. I really could have done without the advice chapter at the end. Wendy was brave to discuss a lot of the things she did about her personal life and marriage. This book is an okay read but it is nothing that you should rush out to get. Don't mistake this book for a celebrity gossip book, this book is basically all about Wendy Williams."
2,A Whole Lotta Wendy,"I didn't buy this book expecting War & Peace; I bought it because I used to listen to her show in New York and I was nosy. Sue me.Ms. Williams is an extremely provocative radio personality with a tremendous on air energy and fearlessness and I had hoped to find out in her book how she came to be such a person. I'd also hoped she would provide a Zelig-like look at the evolution of hip hop. This is where the book disappoints. Ms. Williams is heartbreakingly candid, especially on the subjects of her miscarriages, her struggle to have a child and her husband's infidelity, but she offers little insight as to what drove her to excel in radio, other than a strong desire to hide her cocaine addiction and show up to work on time. She seems to have no real opinions about the nature of hip hop and its impact on her career and popular culture. Still, her folksy, breezy writing is like a book version of her show and fans should find it enjoyable."
3,curious,"First, I have to ask who thought that the cover photo of Wendy was remotely attractive? It's hideous and creates the wrong impression. This is a workmanlike tell all bio. It doesn't get into how Wendy actually made her jump into stardom and it doesn't tell much about how a radio show is produced or what it's like to be a woman in the music industry.I will give Wendy credit for one thing: She doesn't hold back when it comes to telling on herself. We get to read about her serious drug use, her miscarriages, her rape and her husband's affair. Whether she meant to or not she paints a picture of a profoundly unlikeable person. It's a curious book. Usually biographies don't work so hard to make you dislike the subject."
1,words cannot describe...,"what an utter piece of useless garbage this book is. If you like Wendy's brand of ""Look I know about a star's dirty laundry"" gossip, that's your entitlement. Taste comes in good and bad. But this book revealed Wendy to be exactly what she is: a pathetic, parasitic, completely false wannabe who honestly (and delusionally) believes she's a show-biz diva.If there's any real humor in this book, that's it. Save your money and your time. This is one of those books that had no reason to be published. The writing is atrocious, the language obviously planned, and the point nonexistent. If, as one reader said, this was ""the best book you ever read,"" please RUN to the nearest bookstore with all the cash you can spare and head for the literature section!"
2,Don't Bother... !('Just Us Girls' Book Club),"The ladies of 'Just Us Girls' Book Club reviewed Wendy's book in October '03. At times, Wendy was too in-depth but left the most important parts out (two sides to a story but we only read Wendy's side). The group also felt Wendy came across as a shallow person. Her story was repetitive as it related to her drug abuse. The story also lacked specific details and actual names."
1,A Poorly Written Book,"The writing in the book is so poor all I could do was to put in down in disgust. The book opens with such sentences as ""I am not hating on""... and there are street words and slang used throughout the book that made me wonder if the book had an editor. Later, there are comments from the author that if a woman can [perform certain actions] she will get somewhere in the radio business. I mean really. The book I am sure captures the author's voice, but to put that voice in a book and expect people to pay for the poor English and horrible writing is an act of wishful thinking. Also, the cover that is displayed on the Amazon page is not the cover that is on the book. The actual book's cover is much more provocative and it is as disappoiting as it is stupid. I don't care about he author's breast size. Finally, the lines in this book are spaced far apart and what one is really getting is a half a book that has been stretched to look like a whole book. ..."
2,Wendy's Got the Heat,"I read the book this past week and the book was not all that great. I felt like I was listening to one of her shows except I was reading it. She kept referring to her past drug habit through out the book. I definitely give her props for putting herself out there like that but it seemed like she was just making unnecessary references to her cocaine addiction. The references just seemed out of place in certain chapters. The book could have been better written out. The book seemed like it just dragged on and on. However, I do give her credit for being able to speak on her drug past, infidelity, insecurities, and all that stuff the women experience everyday. The book just wasn't well put together."
2,Good Story - Poorly Written,"Wendy Williams has an excellent story to tell. I found her life, trials, and tribulations to be entertaining as well as inspiring. I found good advice in her book. I would have enjoyed the book more if it was more in depth. It only touches upon most areas of her life before moving onto another one. There are some misspellings and occasionally the book jumps back and forth and its hard to follow. Wendy, I think you have had a hard and fabulous life. You have so many stories to tell and can elaborate upon. You need a better writer to assist you and a much longer book to tell it in."
1,Wendy is beyond amazing but this book was the worst ever,"Sadly, the story of her growing up and chalenges as an adult were not interesting, surprising, enjoyable, absolutely no humor or anything imaginative or interesting....a very boring tale to tell us. However, I wanted to know more about her growing up but now know it is identical to millions others, nothing fascinating whatsoever. What a shame I bought this quickie easy read, it was extremely boring and I couldn't wait to throw it in the garbage bin....thank God it only cost $4.97. I now know I would not want to read any other Wendy books, I'll continue to be a fan of her hilarious old radio show in NY as well as her EXCELLENT talk show on Fox every day. I love that gal, HOW U DOIN?MOST HORRIBLE BOOK EVER, I HATED IT, LOVE HER, THOUGH.SUCH A YAWN!"
3,just ok,Expected more from Wendy - queen gossip yet I felt the read lacked details and was very vague. Hate the guessing game throughout as in Terrance Dean's book on DL lifestyle. I mean if you gonna go there with the dirt - go there!
3,Could Have Been Better,"This book would have been a lot better if the author didn't repeat herself so often. After awhile you get tired of reading the same drug stories over and over. I also didn't appreciate her comments about single mothers, it was inappropiate and unnecessary."
4,IT WAS OK,I CAN APPRECIATE AN ARTIST WHO CAN GIVE SUCH EXPLICIT DETAILS OF THEIR PERSONAL LIFE. IT WAS A GOOD BOOK. I GOT TO GIVE IT TO HER SHE OVERCAME SOME HARD TIMES. I GIVE HER PROPS FOR OVERCOMING HER ADDICTION BY HERSELF. I WISH THAT ALOT OF OTHER ADDICTS COULD BE AS STRONG.
4,Wendy Fans Won't Be Disappointed...............,".......as she gives us more than just a peek into her private life, and how she became the radio diva that she is today. I respect Wendy because although she has no problem discussing any celebrity's private life publicly, she is equally as revealing about her own life. This book takes you through her childhood, college experience and early days in radio detailing the struggles that she's faced that have made her the media success that she is today. I have a renewed appreciation for her as a personality, and her radio show....she is definitely ""doing the d*** thing!"""
1,Don't do it,"As a person who listened to Wendy during her inital hey days, used her now defuct 1st and 2nd website (there is a 3rd) in all honest I must say this book was HORRIBLE.I was expecting her to get down and dirty in her books like she has done to so many guests on her show. This was pure floss and was just an extension of her current show. I cannot believe how she disrespected everyone by using racial slurs in the introduction. As a avid reader I can say this is a waste of anyone's time. If your interested in a radio career read the introduction and your covered.We all know she's a former addict, and we now know she's delusional to believe her own hype. Cheating husband and she accepted that and want women to think she was strong in doing so to keep her family together. Sorry but she's looks like a women with self esteem issues who was lucky enough to land on her feet.Get it from the library."
2,Don't waste your money,"I wouldn't waste my money on this book if I was you, you're better off borrowing it from someone else. This book was wack, she mainly talked about her coke habit. She kept repeating things that was already discussed. It was a boring read, the only reason I kept going is because I had to pay for it, matter of fact I want a refund. Wendy if you see this, please stick to radio. I think people bought this book out of curiosity."
4,I finished the book in less than a day...,"I'm a Wendy listener so my review maybe somewhat biased, but I really connected to Wendy's story. Listening to her daily (well as much as I can) I feel she's an associate of mine. While reading the book, if you know Wendy's voice, you can picture her telling the story to you, like 2 girlfriends catching up over dinner. I admire her ability to be so honest and forthright with her drug addiction and the infidelity of her husband -- something that many women go through but are too ashamed to admit. It boils down to the fact that you have to be in the situation to truly understand why the person chose to stay with their mate after infidelity. My favorite part? The whole thing, but especially the end, when she offers advice -- for relationships and life in general."
2,Wendy's Heat Is Cold,"I have to give it up to Wendy Williams. To be a black woman in the same league as Howard Stern is impressive. However, this book is NOT impressive. First of all, why all the cussing and ghetto talk? What is she trying to prove with by writing like that? Secondly, I think her comments about single parents was too harsh and totally unfair. I do agree with what she is saying, because I am waiting until I get married before I have kids. But I have friends who are single parents and they do a D@MN good job with their kids. She talks alot about self esteem, but in my opinion she lacks it. In fact, her book left me feeling depress. Also, some of the stories felt rushed and not well thought out. And please, don't EVEN get me started on the cover of the book. That was a sign to avoid this book. I should have trusted the sign. Rent this book, but don't buy it."
3,Is That All There Is? I prefer Robin Quivers,"I have not purchased the book but thumbed through it in a store.Thoughts?:1. the book is short considering all of the issues discussed2. why is there no index?3. the prose seems sloppy and at times there are embarrassing typos (for example, it is Celine Dion, not Dionne)4. the cover photo is more suited to a porn mag not to a book5. even though she claims not to look down on Robin Quivers, I think there is some animosity. Robin has class.Wait for it in the bargain bin."
2,Nice Collection but unhappy with visual quality,"DVD suffers from over-compression. Back ground images appear frozen at times causing a ""blurring effect"". Closeup facial images drift in and out of focus. I found it to be quite frustrating to watch. VSH tapes, while lower in resolution at least maintained a consistant viewing experience. I'm not likely to purchase season two, even though I loved the series."
5,I'm sure it's excellent but...,"I'm keeping this in mint condition because it is so gorgeous. The first season of the X-Files was amazing so it's got to be worth every single penny doesn't it, even if you don't open the box and watch 'em it'll still look good on your mantelpiece!"
5,Do you believe,"The quality of the DVDs is good. I didnt get any discs that had errors on them.It is a wonderful throwback to my favourite show as a kid, even young adult."
5,One of the best tv shows ever,"This show is a mix of so many genres: drama, scifi, horror and action. The best episode of this season is ""Ice."""
5,The DVD is out there!,"What a wonderful collection of DVD's for the X-files fan. Deleted scenes are included as well as a bonus DVD that has a documentary about the first season of this groundbreaking series. The bonus DVD also contains creator, Chris Carter, and his comments about several of the episodes in this season and much more. If you're a ""phile"", this is a must own. Those who aren't fans will be hooked after watching this series!"
5,Trust No One (except this review),"I watched this show religiously from the first episode in 1993 until about 2 years ago-I just got too busy and frankly the writing was going down hill a la E.R. This set showcases that first glorious season in crisp beautiful picture and sound along with many extras. Like another reviewer said, 'man they don't make them like they used to...' Great stuff-well worth the money."
4,No extras!!,"I just spent a weekend relieving the glorious days of season 1 of X-files. It reminded me why I started watching it in the first place. However, as this reissue lack the extra material disc (which seems to be the sole reason why this version is over 40 dollars cheaper!), could they not have spared us the so-called extras that they have added? I mean, international clips of the episodes? Is it really interesting to watch Mulder 'talk' in Japanese, Russian, German.... ? Please. In this case, more is less."
5,An unbelievable boxed set for an incredible series,I recieved my DVD boxed set today and it certainly did not disappoint . This collection is a must have for any fan of the series. After watching some of my favortie science fiction series get canceled or fade away I thought I would never find another program that was worth watching. The X-Files gave me hope again as well as an incredible and compelling series to watch. My only hope now is that they put the rest of the complete seasons on DVD.
3,Memory lane,"This was really a nice purchase, hours of good entertainment. Why three stars then? Grainy in places and lots of jitters, like frames were missing in the film, but at this price I won't complain."
5,The Roots of Conspiracy,"Being a late comer to the show I was intrigued, and immensly pleased to discover that the show had an underlying mythology. I bought this first season set and after watching the pilot I knew that this series was one of a kind. Chris Carter had a vision for this show from it's inception. Not only did Carter and co. produce wonderful new monsters (or perhaps old ones clothed in new flesh), but he was able to start a story that would permeat the entire series. From the very first episode we find the Cigarette-Smoking Man lurking in the shadows. This season introduces Mulder's first informant known as ""Deep Throat"", and the season finale is absolutely amazing; providing an ambiquous future for the series as well as a wonderful book-ending for the season. Mythology episodes include: Pilot, Deep Throat, Fallen Angel, E.B.E., and The Erlenmeyer Flask.This season will definitly leave you thristy for more."
3,Great Concept,"This was a well written, original sci fi series but I thought a lot of the episodes were unnecessary and was disappointed by the ending. Was it all just a government conspiracy or did alien abduction really occur?? The show hints at the latter but is very ambiguous."
2,Worst episode yet,This episode was not as forward looking as one would have hoped. Technology themes require at least one novel idea that hasn't been done a million times already.
1,Ripoff,"Imagine if a kindergartener were to write a summary of The Thing, and bear in mind that this kid's daddy covered their eyes and ears when the dog transforms into the thing. This episode is what you probably imagined.I'm watching these episodes out of boredom, and I cannot fathom how this show continued beyond the first season. They're horrible! I remember enjoying the later seasons when it aired, but then again, I was a kid myself at that time. I could have written a better plotline and script, though."
4,"X-files is a great Sci-fi TV show, but I highly recommend ""supernatural 1"" and Supernatural 2.""","Some of the episodes of X-files were riveting and quite entertaining, but if you wanted the best Sci-fi TV show, I would recommend ""supernatural 1"" and Supernatural 2"" they're the best I've ever seen so far. I recommended them to some people, and now they couldn't wait for Supernatural 3. Supernatural is spectacular!"
4,From Texas to Ohio,The outer case was pretty banged up but the disks were great. There weren't any scratches at all.
4,Incredible Bargain but you get what you pay for.,"It was great to watch the whole season back to back, and 24 episodes for under 100 bucks is an undeniable bargain. However its very clear they had to make some sacrifices to fit 4 episodes per single sided, single layer disc. The video ranges from excellent to below VHS quality, exibiting almost every type of DVD video defect there is at one point or another. I also experienced some chops and jumps which I have not seen on any other DVD. The sound is excellent however. I recomend this to any X-files fan and I won't hesitate to buy season 2, but if you are a DVD videophile, prepare for some cringing."
3,More dealings with supposed alien abduction,"What keeps this show going for me is how snarky and sarcastic Mulder is even when faced with some of the most ruthless agents mucking up their investigations. If it weren't for Scully constantly making sure Mulder doesn't overstep people's privacy and space, he might be out of line a few times. This episode is pretty slow, and it doesn't even have a closer (end). It's not a cliff-hanger, but the main question (can you wear stilettos while jumping on a water bed?) isn't ever answered. The credits just roll.OFF-TOPIC: The family has a Marantz receiver under the TV (I recognize that horizontal fly-wheel dial for the radio anywhere). Now I'm thinking of how I can add ""attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or release of glucocorticoids"" in everyday conversations. I'm sure I can bring it up at our next poker game on Thursdays..."
5,The abc's of the X-Files,"The fans of this very missed t.v. series will argue over which season really marked the point where the X-Files ""jumped the shark"" or reached its peak and went downhill from there. But there is very little doubt among fans that the success of the series began here, with the phenomenal episodes of the first season. Not every episode was great--and no other t.v. show had a perfect first season--but every episode was thrilling and fascinating. Among the best are ""Ice"", ""Born Again"", ""Tooms"", ""Eve"" and ""Fire"". Even some of the lesser quality episodes, like ""Ghost in the Machine"" and ""Shadows"", were absorbing. In any event, this is the season where you would learn the basics of the show, if you'd never watched an episode before. And while things twisted and changed, the groundrules were established here.Now that Amazon is making this set available at a reasonable price, there is no excuse not to purchase it--unless there's a conspiracy against you."
3,X-Files Viewing,"I just purchased the first season of the X-Files and I wanted people to know about the quality of the DVD's. I think that the quality is poor at best. It is very grainy and milky to look at. Everything plays well, there are no video flaws, its just not the best picture to look at.I think its worth buying,just not the better video I have seen."
3,"Great Serie, Medium/Bad Quality","The X files is one of my favorites series and that's the only one reason cause I give to this item 3 stars. Everything but content of the material doesn't pass the minimum quality level. Video quality is poor and show pixels in a HD TV. Sound in this version is just Stereo, so the power of home cinemas Hi Fi Systems are unuseful. Summarizing, you shouldn't buy this unless you're as fan as myself of the serie, particularly."
5,SPOILER,"SPOILER SPOILER, Read after youve watchedOkay, at the end when Mulder climbs in the passage to find Tooms, what the heck was he thinking?? Granted, he could have just been checking to see if he was down there but... he saw the slime. He continued to crawl and then he was all ""AHHH OMG HE'S HERE... HELP ME SCULLY"" uhmmmm duhhh! lol"
4,Love those X-Files,Have viewed about half of the dvds. All are good and the remaining dvds look good. Case is ok. I am satisfied with the purchase.
4,Because she cares....,"For an episode that revolves around the stuff I don't like (UFO/aliens), I still enjoyed this one. Scully sees the huge flaw about Mulder and instead of constantly chastising him about it, she only contrasts his ""blinding"" belief with her defensive logic. More paranoia and new questions start to crop up in this one."
4,"Great Package, But coulda been better!","First of all-- this is a great DVD set and worth every penny of even the maximum price. For 'X-Philes', this is a perfect way to own every first season episode and for 'X-Philes Yet to Be', this is an initiation like no other. However, there are disappointments. With only a couple of deleted scenes, the viewer is left wanting for more. Chris Carter's narration is recycled from the older VHS tapes without anything new for the avid fans. Additionally, for those of us addicted to the superior writing, some background on the writing or research behind the episodes would have been a nice addition."
3,"Great Series, serious problems with disks","I loved this set with the exception of 1 major problem. The episode ""Fallen Angel"" (one of the best in the first season) is completely unwatchable. I tried this disk on 3 separate DVD players and it skipped and stopped playing 4 or 5 times in the 20 minutes that I watched. I watched another episode (Eve) on this disk and there were no problems. I would have rated this set 5 stars if not for this problem"
3,Great collection - disappointing DVD features,"I already owned the first season of the X-Files completely on VHS, as it was available in Europe and I was looking forward to replace it through the better qualitites DVDs of course. While I am satisfied with the episodes, I do think that the additional features offered on the 7th DVD are rather poor. Honestly who cares about 10 second TV spots? But they are all there...Also the additional feature documentaries are rather short and mostly contain material once prepared for TV. I really did expect more background information on the series...What I like though are the clips in foreign languages of different episodes, although I am sure a wider selection would have been possible. Dont miss out to listen to Scully's extremely sexy voice (dubbed) in German :-)"
5,Best TV serie ever created,"I'd seen many TV series,many of them are now gone for good,but I have to say this serie had always called my attention.I have to admit that I'd only seen like the first two seasons and a few episodes of the new ones which are even greater.I love this serie.The mistery is always present but you'll never now what it is.It's like you're afraid of something that u can't even see.I love the music,story and characters.I started liking this serie since day one.It really got a great and different plot.Lucky me I found an anime serie,""Serial Experiment Lain"" that's more or less the same thing.I love this sort of stuff.I watched the movie and it stayed true to the serie.They did something different.Most series are based on movies but the movie was based on the serie which made it a great movie.I recommend everyone to buy it.The serie gets very interesting as u watch it.I hope todays series were just like this one.I'm glad it's now on DVD.It's a master piece!"
4,The Truth is Out There,"Welcome to the world of Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder and Dana Scully. Great stroy writting and several worthy episodes. I enjoy the two episodes involving Eugene Victor Tooms and hope to see more of him in season two. The final two episodes are very strong and are worthy of being dubbed X-files classics.I understand why the show received such rave reviews, I only wish I would have been exposed much earlier then now."
5,Come play with us. Forever and ever...,"Some episodes are slow and drawn out. This one has so much going in it that you forget that it's 46 mins long. You're too busy trying to figure out what is really going on and who is involved. Some episodes rely on one small twist (usually at the end) to put it all together. This episode has many twists and false leads that throw you off. Not much for character development or action scenes, but one of the few times Mulder is actually wrong on his theory. It's strictly just a well written script that keeps you guessing."
1,Great show but false advertising by Amazon,"I love the Xfiles and was really excited when I saw ""Season 1"" was available for free for Prime members. Then, when I clicked on it, it was only the first pilot episode. If you want to watch the whole first season, the cost is more than $38. This this absolutely ridicoulous! Amazon is betting I will get hooked and then impuslively buy and pay for this outragous price! Shame on Amazon, and I am a Prime member too."
5,UNTIL THE WAVE ROLLS OUT,"WAVE #8 and SEASON 1 (all episodes) will as always be tremendous. My only complaint is that a lot of the world won't be able to see these, because they own VCR's rather than DVD players. A consideration on producing these on both VHS and DVD would be greatly appreciated, not to mention it would add another 50% to the profit sharing aspect of this business."
1,horrible video quality,it goes from horrible to only semmy horrible.ive seen every x-files episode and this is an extreme dissappointment
4,The beginning,"Before The X-Files became a global smash hit for Fox, it started as a modestly budgeted Friday night thriller that soon became a cult classic. Then virtual unknown actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson starred as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully respectively; both of whom are assigned to the X-Files: a division of the FBI which investigates paranormal activity. Like many of Fox's other prime time shows at the time (except for The Simpsons and Melrose Place), the future of The X-Files was uncertain; so the on going plot lines and self-parody hurmor would not take full circle until later seasons. This first season isn't the best in the series' nine season run, but it is a step into one of the greatest prime time telivision dramas to hit network TV in years. Standout episodes include ""Darkness Falls"", ""Ice"", and ""Squeeze/Tooms"" which guest starred Doug Hutchison (The Green Mile, Salton Sea) who was one of the most underrated and creppy villians the series would ever have."
5,The Holy Grail,"I have just received this box set and i can't put it down.Any fans who haven't already bought this,well all I can say is it's time to throw all your vhs copies away and revel in the commercial free,mint and flawless presentation of your favourite show.The memories come flooding back to remind you that this is some of the best television EVER,and Season 2 cannot come fast enough.An essential purchase."
4,Still Great after all these years,"I watched the X-files back when I was in high school. I was a huge fan then, however I haven't seen them in many many years (I don't have any channels that rerun them). I saw this was on sale for $20 and couldn't pass it up. Rewatching these episodes was great, I enjoyed all of them. There were a handful though that I consider passable, but didn't really stand up the test of time. The majority of the episodes on here I feel are still AAA quality. I highly recommend this season. If you are looking for extras however, skip this because there aren't any. If you are a fan of the series and your just looking to rewatch the episodes then you can't go wrong.(Note I also bought seasons 2 and 3 but I haven't finished those yet. I recommend those as well.)"
5,This could be the start of something big,"Wow, what a mix. Take one part of ""Kolchak, the Night Stalker"", ""The FBI"", and ""The Outer Limits"" and stir carefully. The X-Files was fun watching, especially at the start. It is a hoot to watch the development of both characters and plot thread that will eventually be woven into a tapestry of myth. Scares, they are in there. Look for a lot of humor also. This is not just a monster hunt.This set is in the slim set format that I really like. It is space saving with no lost of content."
2,Heidi Chronicles,"The movie was just as dull and frustrating as the film. Relationships are alleged but not developed. Everything is treated as though you already know what is going on. I liked this story the first time I saw it, but now wonder how it got a Pulitzer --"
2,The Demon is in the Details,"While von Baeyer's discussion of Clerk Maxwell and his ""demon"" is quite interesting and, for the most part, informative, he ignores the dramatic appearance of the demon in modern literature. Thomas Pynchon, whose superior fiction focusses on entropy, spends untold brilliant words discussing Maxwell's demon in ""The Crying of Lot 49,"" his most accessible work. A chapter devoted to Pynchon's theories and how well they correllate with Maxwell's and, perhaps, an imaginary debate between Pynchon and Maxwell, would have added immeasurably to the faint enjoyment I derived from the book. He also missed the clear musical salute to Maxwell by the Beatles in ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer,"" which allegorically compares the demon to English common law."
1,Goodbye to Master P,"What kind of trash is this, I know it's good-sprited, but please! He already talked about his dead homies on, ""I miss My Homies"", which was a okay track, but to repeat himself again, with sucky lyrics, and on top of that jocking of Boyz 2 Men with the hook is just pathetic. Avoid this trash!"
5,A music fan from Cali ........ Still comming on strong,"I love this song ""Goodbye to my homies"" because it reminds me of my friend who committed suicide last year, and everytime I hear this song it reminds me of him. It makes me think back on the good times we had together. It shows people how precious life really is. No matter how bad your problems are they always get better....................."
2,Getting kind of old now,This isn't a very bad song but Kevin Miller died a long time ago and how many songs does P have to release about him? We all feel his pain already P just stay to rapping about drugs and alchohol.
5,The Best tribute to a dead freind,"This is a sad and emotoinal song about a close friend,a husband and a father."
2,Who sang the original????,"The original ""Homies"" song deserves 10 stars, this one doesn't even come close. If anyone knows who sang the original please post it. (I don't think it was Boyz 2 Men)."
4,Amazing Art,This amazing book showcases the etchings of Giovanni Battista Piranesi in a wide format. It's beautiful.
4,smooth track,"i always use to rock this Jam back in the day.I'm one of those People that was sad when Tony,Toni,Tone Broke up because I felt they were starting to get Good right when they parted.cuts like this still sound so Smooth&on point all of these years later.dug the arrangements of this song big time."
2,Too dated and technical,I felt that this book was too dated to be of much use. Apparently much of the research took place 10-15 years ago and I must think that there have been significant changes in RVing in the elapsed time.
3,Cream soured,"I love Cream. One would think that for one of rock's all time concerts, they could put together a competent video. Sorry, I like many Cream fans were disappointed here. Songs are cut in half by cheesy narrative that really has no place, and the interviews are bad to say the least. They need to put out the whole concert; it's billed as a concert isn't it? Narrative is horrible, just show the band play."
2,Idiotic cinematography,"I love Cream, but I was very disappointed with the silly cinematography. The camera operator decided to simulate the psychedelic experience by rapidly cycling the zoom lens all the way in and all the way out. Give me a break! This just looks cheesy and dumb. Unfortunately there is so much of this kind of foolishness that I have only watched the show once, and then I put it on the shelf where it has stayed. Not recommended. If you are a guitar player and wanted to see Clapton play, don't waste your time."
4,Just play,"Forget the lyricsForget the messageJust playThis is a review of the Special Extended Edition.I grew up on the Cream and never realized how short lived they were or the dynamics of the people that make up the Cream. This DVD allows one to revisit the time and place with a new vision. Hindsight can be as entertaining as the original vision.The cream went with me into the Vietnam War so they are hard to forget. Even today I find myself singing ""in the Sunshine of your love"" and someone in the next cube would finish. One day that will be my ring tone. I'm always telling my wife to get into my big black car. Speaking of cars they make great driving music. Now I actually have a visual to match with this film. You definitely need this for your collection.Cream - Royal Albert Hall - London May 2-3-5-6 2005"
4,All the other reviewers missed the point,"All of you other reviewers totally missed out on the this one. I read all the reviews and decided not to purchase this. My friend pulled out a VHS copy and said don't believe everything you read. He could not have been more correct. Yes the close up camera work, lack of long shots, cheesey special effects, and the campy documentary style are a little annoying and yet somewhat amusing. Remember though, this was 1968. What you'll miss if you don't see this is an performance by three geniuses Ginger Baker's drum solo alone is enough to own this. You will have to think out of the box a little to get through the ""ancient special effects"" but, if it really annoys you that much just close your eyes and listen to perhaps the best jam band ever."
5,cream de la creame,"If you ever wondered how the speed of Ginger Baker's hands appeared when he played ""Toad""; this video covers it excellently. This video offers two important concepts in musical videos: 1. Short and effective interviews. 2. Covers band members playing more than talking. A good Cream lover's delight."
2,A wretched botch of a historic concert,"No way to sugarcoat it: the director ruined this film, completely bungling his job. He must have thought he was part of the band, or that Cream needed his help to rock the audience. All kinds of cheesy '60s camera effects are deployed--rapid zooming in and out, rapid focus shifts from foreground to background, editing that looks like it was done by a food processor--showing a total lack of repect for the musicians. Buy it, if you must; but you can enjoy it just as much by playing it through the stereo with the picture turned off."
2,dissapointed too :(,"I just had to see for myself and many of the reviews were right, bad! Sound picture and there was interuptions all through-out what was surpose to be a concert. I didn't pay much so if you want this DVD do not pay much for it. I love the fact that you can look at peoples reviews, it really helps with my sellections! Hope this helps yours"
2,"Great Music, Weak Video","The narrative comments regarding guitars and rock music are so odd and out of place that they could only have been made in 1967. This had to come from some news reel, or documentary from 1967 regarding Cream and the final concert. The interviews are okay, but they were unecessary. I don't believe audiences in the 21st century need to learn what a wah-wah pedal is, or how to use the tone controls on a guitar. And the editing is just dreadful. It's worse than the standard MTV music video 1/2 second edit. Too bad, because the playing is simply awsome."
3,Not a Good Way To Experience Live Cream,"This DVD's packaging and footage looks so much like a bootleg I almost thought it was one.Cream produced a lot of excellent music for the two years they were together. I have their 2005 reunion concert taped off PBS, and was looking forward to seeing the band how they were back in the '60s. But this DVD is something I wish I hadn't had the misfortune of seeing. The camera work is poor, the film looks fuzzy, and the music is interrupted with narration. The music is amazing (as always) but the poor presentation of this great concert is very disappointing to me.I'm glad this wasn't the final farewell, for the 2005 reunion is far superior to this hack job of a film. My advice: if you want to see good live Cream, go for the reunion CD/DVD."
2,Cream Farewell Concert 1968,If you are a die hard cream fan then this video isint for you. Buy starnge brew. It inly has clips of each song and not the complete backsatge interviews. Also it has vocie overs. Being a huge fan of them this video was the worst. Fresh cream is better and strange brew. Those may be hard to find since i think therye out of print. Settle for this or fresh live cream its good.
5,Great look back on great band,"Sound is excellent. Filming well done (although there were a lot of wierd shots of just microphones and mouths). Great to see these guys in their prime. The interviews are also very interesting, expcially the reactions of the band members not being interviewed."
2,bad productions!,"whoever filmed this, did a terrable job. there were barly any wide shots of what was going on. it was always up close on the faces. it sounds pretty good after being remastered. the 2005 performance they did is alot better."
3,what it be like,"The dvd was made when production values were rather low. The sound is not very good especially compared to recent dvd's.The camera work is not much better. However, the performance is quite good. They are playing at or near their peak.I would still recommend this dvd because I remember seeing cream back in the old days.Well my memory is not that good either."
2,Farewell Concert -- NOT!,"I was bummed to find that not one number is shown in its entirety, only segments. The list of features is misleading. You get pumped figuring this is the film of the album, but it's not, it totally craters. The interviews, from it seems a year or so prior, are amusing. Sample some pics from it with your Snappy and send it along, or donate it to the library (if you can itemize.)"
2,"It Should Have Been Great, but ...","We know the boys were giving it their bloody all, based on everything we've read about their farewell. Unfortunately, this production is nearly ruined by terrible sound, echoing all over the place, and then the abysmal camera work, which reaches a frustrating nadir when the stoned cameraman goes absolutely berserk with the zoom apparatus, wanking that thing for all it's worth in an apparent attempt to simulate an LSD trip (?) (and, my god, the editor left it in!) Other than that the camera is content to crawl up the nostrils of the trio or examine their dental work.That being said, the interviews are rather amusing, with the lads innocently talking gear and technique."
3,nervous camera?,It's a nice documentary but I get nervous every now and thenIt's too bad that it is only a part of the show.But then again it is better than nothing.
3,Cream - A Disappointing Farewell,"I saw this in a movie theatre many many years ago and have not seen the revised DVD. Cream had three of the best musicians of that era and created some fantastic music. I was disappointed at the length of the feature and felt that the producers left out some of the songs from the concert. I would have preferred to see the entire concert without any psychodelic effects and the interviews at the end. Cream is about the music. I wanted to see Eric, Jack and Ginger play, not talk about the Wah-Wah pedal. I will always feel cheated, hearing and seeing only part of their farewell concert. There are not many videos of the Cream in their heyday. This is better than nothing. Great band, but the original movie could have been better. I hope that the DVD is improvement on the movie."
2,Buyer Beware,"They shouldn't call this ""The Farewell Concert"". There's very little concert here. The thing is also very pooly filmed and edited. There are bits and pieces of songs. This would make a nice ""extra"" for a good video disc, but doesn't stand well on it's own at all."
2,A disappointment for fans.,"The video documenting Cream's Farewell Concert is an extreme disappointment. First of all it is only 50 minutes. For a band that is known to play twenty and sometimes thirty minute songs, this doesn't leave much time for the music. There is not one complete song on the whole video. If they show a full song it has some bad narration over the beginning. Not to mention the many songs that were played that night that must have been forgotten(Sitting on top of the World & Crossroads). If your looking for a good Cream documentary on video, I suggest Cream's Strange Brew. It has all the good stuff form the Farewell Concert and a lot more. There is also The Fresh Live Cream on DVD that just came out. It sounds really good too."
2,Mostly interviews-little music,"This is a documentary on Cream. It looks like it was made for British TV. It is about half interviews and half music. It is only 47 minutes long. There are no complete songs. The songs start in the middle or end abruptly. The announcer talks over large portions of the songs.The picture and sound quality are poor. The actually camerea shots were poor. It looks like it was pulled from an old video tape. The DVD has no special features.There are some interesting parts to the interviews, where each band member explains how they play their instruments and how they acheive their sound. But, most of it is a gloss over without really getting into the band. There is no mention of how they formed or what tore them apart.There are some nice bits of them playing, but it isn't enough to justify buying this."
2,Not the best choice if you're a Clapton fan rather than Crea,"If you are absolutely crazy about Cream then there is some Ginger Baker ""How I do it"" tricks to watch, some Clapton guitar tricks explained, but music-wise not the best of Cream I must say. Also the disc is disappointing in length."
3,Classic Cream concert but not enough concert!!!,"This is a OK DVD,the quality is a bit rough and the songs are not complete versions!!! When they go into the song after an interview it has already been started!!! The interviews are pretty cool!!! Still with all it's faults, Cream fans will probably like it!!! 5 stars for the classic music 1 for the DVD"
1,This is the OLD POORLY FILMED concert- Buy the new one from 2005!,"Imagine being given a chance to capture this band in what would be one of it's greatest performances and then film them lying on your back using a macro lens frantically waving the camera. It's actually upsetting to look at if your a fan and that's what this is. No redeeming value whatsoever (not even for the listening experience), just alot of nose hair, teeth and fractions of songs. This ""Remastered Edition"" by the way contains no re-editing...which means you get sharper images of the same crappy film. This is garbage and should be shelved forever. Don't even rent it."
1,Better than nothing,"Much of what I could contribute has already been said about this DVD. The editors even had Clapton change from a 335 to a Firebird in the middle of a solo. I knew he was good, but seriously folks!! In spite of all the drawbacks, it is the most complete record we have of a Cream concert in a large venue. However, there is room for hope! PLEASE, if anyone out there with the wherewithall will listen. Please record all nights of the upcoming Albert Hall series of concerts and release a box DVD set including every performance, plus rehearsal footage in a pristine, unaltered form using state of the art recording equipment!! This is the one and only way out of this disaster. What do you say? we're listening.........and waiting...and listening."
1,"This isn't a concert, it's a documentary.",Concert? What concert? The best part of the whole tape is Ginger Baker's drum solo at the last 10 minutes of the tape.
5,How to Reprogram Your Database,With this book and the cassettes you are able to look at yourself and your behavior from a different perspective. You will identify negative childhood programming and the effect it has on your current life. The book offers ways to change your negative thinking. It is a wonderful guide to travel in your inner self and grow. (to Amazon: Please replace the current review with this one. I wanted to give 5 stars instead of 4 and hit the wrong button. Thanks for correcting my former review!)

2,Miserable context,"There's little point commenting on the content of the films themselves, they are fascinating. But if you're going to release a set of obscurities based in specific historical circumstances, you've got to help the viewer a little! The documentaries are awful. What's worse, the subtitles are mostly a digest and not translations of the words at all, as if the producers were worried a modern audience wouldn't detect the propaganda message... and you can't turn them off!"
3,So - so,"Could really see any difference with one tub. Just going to stay with regualr Zero carbs, which is really good than most of the other brands out there."
2,Rip off compared to regular ISOPURE only 9 servings,"The product came on time and vendor and sale was ok. The product however is crap. There are only 9 servings in the container. Just dissapointed that I have to use 6 scoops vrs the traditional 2 scoops in regular ISOPURE. The protein amount is also more or less the same. Learning experience I guess. I recommend just sticking to the regular ISOpure. If you order this one, make sure you order another one the same time because it will be gone fast."
2,Not Made for a Classroom,"The idea of this thermometer is great. However, it is not durable. The students in my lower-elementary classroom broke it within a few days. Specifically, the glass tube detached from the plastic case."
1,NO RETURNS ALLOWED,"I purchased this Elmo costume on Amazon from Brands on Sale. The costume is VERY heavy... it's more like a light snowsuit! I immediately called to get return info because I knew my daughter would be way too hot in this costume (w/ shipping it was 62 dollars--no small potatos!) The rude customer service agent told me their ""policy"" was no returns...but they don't state that anywhere on their website!! I asked for a supervisor and the same agent came back on the line 5 min later and said that they would take the costume back minus a 25% ""restocking fee""...I again asked for the supervisor, was put on hold, same agent got back on the line w/ me and said they would waive the fee, like they were doing me a big favor...give me a break! Stay away from Brands on Sale--they are scammers!"
4,Great Costume but CRAZY EXPENSIVE SHIPPING!,"This is the best Elmo costume for a baby I've ever seen. It was warm and looked authentic. We were very pleased with the overall look and feel of the costume. The shipping costs, however, were outrageous. If it hadn't been a last-attempt costume I never would have paid the 65+ shipping charges that they were asking. Buyer beware: Don't fall in love with this costume until you check out the shipping costs first."
5,Very fun,"If you like informational books, this one has a fun way of showing information. It isn't overwhelming for the reader nor the one being read to (our children are under 5). We love this book!"
4,Not too Bad,"Pretty fun little painting. These guys get it right. I bought a ship scene from another PBN company a few months back and either I was terrible at mixing the colors or it was just a bad company. So far I've done two paintings with this company (the kitty, and the bamboo butterflies) and they come out great. The kitty was a little off for me, not sure why. But the bamboo butterflies was gorgeous. This is the company to go with for PBN."
3,Cute paint by number,"I purchased this paint by number for my daughter. Unfortunately, it is more detailed than I would like. Also, I am disappointed that you have to create your own colors by mixing the ones you have. I remember the old days when you had to purchase a bottle of oil paint and ended up with a beautiful glossy painting. Not exactly what I expected but it's OK."
3,love sea life,"I am thankful that you have some under water paint by numbers, however i have been searching for some new ones and i have been seeing the same 5 or 6 under water scenes. I found this and a few i have not seen:) if I can find something like this but much more for an adult i would love that!! would love to see more variety, thank you for this one, is a bit different then i have seen. SiVon:)"
1,terrible,too complicated numbers too small this is not for a child not for a child too complex bought for a six year old.
1,started out well...,"This pbn started out well, until it was time to start on the bright colors. The bright colored paints were completely see through!! Even though I went over with SEVERAL coats, you could still see the numbers!Normally, I would say this type of pbn would be greet for pre-teen and up, but frankly, I was so frustrated I stopped the project all together, and I've never dine that before!This kit also lacked a design chart, which the other Demension pbn kits all included.I wouldn't purchase this again, unless they changed the paints."
1,Might be a good game if it worked.,"Our computer meets all the requirements listed on the box but the game didn't work. It loaded and started, but was so slow it was unusable. At level 3 the computer froze and had to be hard booted.We visited the web site and notified them. They said there was no patch and gave us the run-around.Money down the drain."
1,Big disappointment!!,"This game is difficult to navigate for me, a 34 year old, not to mention my daughter. The games are locked out until you win the before it. Sometimes you have to win it twice. It was very frustrating for my daughter. ""Bratz"" should be ashamed to have their name on this game."
1,Hogwash.,"Faith is a fine enough thing, but this is the sort of book in which faith is used as a trump card to gloss over even the most painful processes and events, cheapening and simplifying them -- a recurring theme in the author's work."
5,JUST A QUICK NOTE,"While any age will enjoy the beautiful artwork, the only way, IMHO, that a baby-preschool child can enjoy this book is if it is read to them. More like children in grades 4+ will enjoy reading this book."
5,amazing,I bought this doll for our little granddaughter for Christmas. She was really thrilled when she open it and continued to be all day long. The doll turned out to be her WOW gift at least at our house. Glad we boughtit! Thanks
4,"Cute, but impatient.","We purchased this doll for my 4 yr old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loved it....for awhile. She became frustrated rather quickly because if she was unable to meet Amanda's (the doll) needs immediately (which is difficult when you're four)then the doll moved on to another request and so on....after making several unsuccessful attempts to satisfy the doll, she layed it down and demanded that I take care of it. Ha! The doll itself is very cute, lovable and does everything she is advertised to do. Just not appropriate for the very young or the easily frustrated. Her older sister, who is 7, seems to enjoy the doll more than she does. I feel confident that she will grow into it in time."
2,Huge disapointment,We bought this doll for our 6 year old daughter and what a big disapointment it was. The pretend food and spoons leave a red/pink ring around amandas mouth and her lips completely popped out while my daughter was trying to feed her which left the doll looking more spooky than she already is. we were able to push her lips back in but in all honesty i dont think Amanda is worth the money that was spent on her. I wouldnt suggest this doll to anyone...for the price that she costs they could have at least made her prettier.
4,This is a cute doll,"My 5 year old daughter just received this doll for Christmas. I was hesitant about it after reading all of the negative reviews, but, I'm glad I went with my own instincts. Set up takes about 10 minutes. You have to read the instructions and be patient. This doll is not for young children. As articulate as you think your child is, the child has to be able to understand that this doll can only respond to certain commands. My daughter has a lisp, and the doll understands her just fine. If you want the doll, go for it, just know it's got limitations. I think she's pretty cute. For the people that think she talks to much - she's an interactive doll - she's supposed to talk. If you tire of her, just tell her to ""go to sleep""... and she stops talking until your child hugs her. Pretty simple."
1,another disappointed daughter,"We bought this doll for our daughter. It's too difficult for her to use. It takes forever to program and then once your batteries run out, you have to do it again. Additionally, the doll has never recognized my daughter's voice. She gets so frustrated that she turns it off. It only works if I'm helping her & saying the commands precisely and slowly, but it takes forever to get the baby to recognize your voice, the command, confirm that it's the action you want to take, ie. snack time, then do the action. . . ugggggggggghhhhhhhh."
3,Not so amazing after all if your child isn't old enough,"My child who is almost 5 was scared of her and kept asking me to turn her off. Even with the doll off, she didn't want to be in the same room alone with her. Also, she got very frustrated having to repeat Amanda's name over and over. My daughter speaks very clearly and yet the doll kept saying ""you don't sound like my mommy"". Maybe we got a dud but I won't find out because my child asked if we could return her which we did. I think she could be lots of fun as long as you get one that works right obviously and your child is old enough not to get frustrated at Amanda's limitations.Oh, and one little tidbit that I thought was really gross (but my kids thought was hysterical) is when Amanda poops (and you can hear the plops) and then says ""Mommy poo-poo stinky!"". A little too realistic for me!"
5,SHUT UP YOU MENTAL DORKS!!!!,"I LIKE HER. IF YOU WANT TO SAY A BAD THING ABOUT AMANDA, DON'T TIPE IT HERE BECAUSE SOME OF US ACTUALLY LIKE HER!!1"
1,I had to upset my daughter,"Im so angry. I bought amazing amanda as soon as it became available. It was horrible, and I though something was wrong with it and I exchanged it for another one. The second one was just as horrible. My daughter is very bright and speaks loud and clear and yet the doll never recognizes her voice. I took it back much to my daughter's dismay. Please dont waste your money. I am going to wait for the maker to get a clue fix it and make it better then maybe it will be worth 100 dollars."
1,totally evil doll,hi i'm a 11 year old girl and this doll is so evil. one time iput her in the play pin with my dolls and she started being meanto them so i returned her to the store
1,Don't buy one!,"This is the only toy my daughter asked for and it doesn't work right! The batteries died in 10 minutes, she keeps telling her that she is not her mommy and they can play until her mommy gets home. She stops working and makes a loud buzzing sound and you have to reset her over and over! Going back to the store in the morning!!"
3,This toy is not worth the money.,"This toy would be good, I suppose in some cases where the child has a loud voice and speaks clearly at the proper time to speak which is after the toy has completely finished talking. In our case it did not recognize or hear my daughters voice most of the time. That although was not my major issue, my major issue is that the batteries 3 C Energizer Max, new, were dead within 24 hrs of purchasing the toy and placing batteries in it. On top of that every time you replace the batteries or if the doll gets turned off, you have to reprogram the doll with in my case 5 year old daughter over and over. So in our case I will returning the doll, in which my daughter is sad telling Amanda she will miss her so now she is grieving the loss of the doll, but I can't see paying almost 100.00 for a doll that needs batteries replaced so often and then to be reprogrammed every time."
2,Not very happy!!,"Well, my daughter wanted this doll so bad , and if you don't say the exact phrases loud or clear enough she will not respond to your chid correctly. I also noticed while my daughter would feed her with the spoon provided or brush her teeth with the dolls tooth brush, this was making the painted lips on the doll come off (peeling off).In my opinion not safe. This doll made my daughter (who wanted this doll in the worse way) so upset and frustrated that the doll sat on the floor until I returned her.Too bad she was cute!"
2,Not so amazing Amanda!,This doll is very cute and life like. She just doesn't work well. Repeats say my name a lot. Rarely recognizes my daughter as mommy. Say batteries are low often even though fresh batteries are in. She has gone hay wire several times...as her facial features moved uncontrollably with out cause having to reset her which takes about 15 minutes to do each time. Wouldn't recommend taking a chance spending the money. My daughter hasn't touched her since day 2!!
1,Annoying,"We bought this for our daughters, 5 and 6, last year for Christmas. We set it up for our oldest but both of them got extremely annoyed with her within a few tries of playing with her. She doesn't seem to understand what they are telling her, either daughter, and they get frustrated with it. She has sat on the shelf for the last year. Would probably be great for the kids if it wasn't so much work for them to use. They just don't have the patience for it."
2,"Daughters love it, I hate it!","I recently purchased this doll for my 7-year old daughter. She absolutely loves it and constantly fights over it with her 2-year old sister. I cannot stand it, though! It is annoying, repetitive, and constantly announces that it's batteries are low. This infuriates me! I believe a doll that costs $100.00 should come with rechargeable batteries. Instead, we are putting three new ""C"" batteries in it every two days. This is no exaggeration! I would not recommend this doll until improvements are made on its battery efficiency."
1,"I'm not a kid, I just don't have an account","I got this a week ago for my daughter to play with, because her stupid box fooled me into thinking she really was amazing.With Amazing Amanda, Jessica had to say her name for 25 minutes until she FINALLY reconized her voice. It annoyed us when Amanda said ""You are not my mommy"" over and over.It also annoys us when she wants Jessica to feed her ""breakfast."" she'll giva Aamnda a pancake, but Amanda'll say ""Silly mommy! Cookie not for breakfast."" Same thing with her potty...Amanda doesn't even reconize when she's on her potty and complain that she had another ""accident"" again.We didn't even get our money back when we sent her in!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Annoying, cloying and frustrating! A case for doll abuse.","This is hands down the most annoying doll I've ever had the misfortune of spending $100.00 on. How MANY times do you have to say her name and why do you have to continue to repeat it over, and over... It's so bad that I turned it off and now at least my little girl plays with it instead of throwing it in frustration. Agree with previous reviewer, it burns through batteries at the rate of lightspeed. This wouldnt be so bad if you could use rechargeable batteries, but nooooo. Not with this doll. Plus, if it runs out of batteries you'll have to repeat the long, tedious set up AGAIN!No Amanda, I'm NOT your mommie! You need to go home now.Save you money - this toy is the first one you'll hide or convieniantly loose after christmas. The frustration just isnt worth it."
1,I don't sound like your mommy??!,"After following the directions very carefully, even programming Amanda quietly with my daughter alone in a room, and using excellent batteries, at start up she continued to say, ""You don't sound like my mommy. Amanda's sad. Can we play until Mommy comes home?"" My daughter would raise her voice or even start crying, ""But I AM your mommy!"" It was just too heartbreaking to get through that one part, even though some of the other playing was OK. We returned her; Amazon is great."
2,Can we say bust?,"I bought this toy for my daughter in sept. She LOVED it..for about a day..then it got thrown to the side into the pile of unplayed with toys. She likes her chou chou SOO much better. Amanda wasn't that hard to set up..it took a little time, but not really too bad. As a parent, I liked it! If I was her age, I would play with the doll. I think the generation's are different tho. When us parents were growing up, we didn't have such interactive toys. I guess once you have come into a technological world, things kinda lose their value. I thought she would love this doll."
2,Terrible Disappointment,"Although my daughter tries very hard to play with this doll, I can't believe what a waste of money it was. I've already returned one doll because the coloring of the mouth was falling off and the eyelids broke and now the same thing has happened with the new one. When I called the the company they didn't care, they just told me to return the doll where I purchased it. It tells time however she tells you where the hands are on the clock. As an adult I can't figure out what time she is trying to say let alone my 4 year old knowing what time it is. Mostly she has to yell at it so it hears and my daughter asks why Amanda ""never listens"". I guess this is another one of those toys that just looks great on TV."
2,Think carefully before buying,"WE purchased this doll after reading the reviews. My daughter played with it on and off for a day. It annoyed her to death. Woke her up all night until she finally turned it off. It does what it said it would, but it just never shuts up and is like a burden on a 6 year old. I did return the doll in hopes of recovering some of the 69$ I spent. This turned my daughter off of baby alive, thinking all the interactive dolls would drive her nuts."
2,to scarey for my dauther . it made some awefull faces.,This toy scared my daughter . she got afraid of it. I got rid of it. She was 7 at the time.
4,Nice doll - really fun,"It has been a lot of fun to see my daughter playing around with this dollit's is dificult to discover which one of them makes the ""robot""because amanda can say a lot of things but my daughter do not have many choice as ""yes"" or ""no"" , ""lets play"" or ""go to sleep"".The batterys are OK untill now (one month old)My daughter is 8 years old now and Amanda is a good toy for all girls with this age, because they can understand what they should do with amanda.I would not recomend this toy for kids under 7 or 6"
1,Battery Hog,My daughter loved this toy at first but after putting the batteries in she only lasts for 2 hours. We had to replace the batteries three times on Chrismas Day. I took her back to the store as she is not worth the money at all.
2,NEVER EVER AGIAN!!!!,"This was the ""mom I have to have it"" toy for my then 4 year old daughter's 5th birthday.I figured 5 is a big birthday so I'd get her the doll even though it has a BIG price tag. Figured if the doll does everything it is said to do then it is worth the money.Well... My daughter played with this for maybe 5 minutes. (after the inital 25 minute set up) Amanda kept saying ""You don't sound like Mommy."" and ""When will mommy be home?""This made my daughter very angry. She tossed the doll on her bed and I think she's played with it 2 times since. Both times ending the same way. After a few minutes of ""you don't sound like mommy"". Amanda gets tossed on the bed and Sydney picks up a ""Normal"" doll.My daughter accidently woke Amanda up the other day (she's been sleeping since October) and my child screamed like someone was trying to hurt her. That's how much she hates this doll..Mine is getting listed on Ebay."
2,Annoying Amanda,"I found this doll to be the most annoying toy ever. If the doll gets turned off instead of just told to go to sleep it has to be reset by your child. This takes a good ten minutes of your child yelling at the doll so that the voice recognition mechanism recongizes to your childs voice!! It repeats the same annoying phrases over and over again and if that wasn't enough, there is no volume control on the doll so between the doll yelling and your child yelling, you want to throw the thing out the window. I would never recommend this to any parent that I know and wish that I would have spent the amount of money that this doll cost on anything else."
2,"Not as good as the old ""amazing"" dolls!","My five year old sister, saw this on tv and wanted it right away, because she owns the older ""amazing"" dolls (Amy, Allie, Maddie...) that my cousin used to own. This doll is a big fat ripoff! Amanda doesn't do anything but eat and pee in her potty, and her mouth doesn't move as good as the others' do.I would only recomend Amanda to kids who never heard of the original ""amazings."""
2,Disapointed,"We only kept this doll for a day before she went back to the store. She was very annoying to us, the parents, she seems to never ""stop talking"" If you use the on off switch to turn her off then you have to reset her program each time you turn her back on. This caused problem between my impatient daughter and I because she did not want to wait for us to aswer the 20 questions before she began to play again. It seemed like the program was very repetitive, and she had a hard time understanding my 4 year old daughters, and me at that matter."
1,AMAZING.. I PAID SO MUCH $$ FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK,"The only thing amazing about this doll is the fact that so many of us have spent this kind of money on a doll that is a total piece of junk....I bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas after she was totally excited about it after watching the commercial on tv. After one day the coloring on the lips came off, the eyelashes fell off making this doll look scary to a little child. After returning it to the store for another one, the same thing happened. Calling customer service is useless and they could care less....they made their money! Total waste of money, plus the fact that my grandaughter is left without one of the toys she truly wanted.DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$ ON THIS ONE! TRULY UNAMAZING! I WOULD SCORE THIS A MINUS 0 IF I COULD."
1,Not So Amazing,I bought this doll for my 6 year old daughter for her birthday and ended up returning it. My daughter speaks very clearly and the doll still could not understand her. Part of the time she didn't understand me. When you sit her on the potty she usuually doesnt recognise that she's there. Maybe the sensor should be on the outside instead. After only an hour of being on she said her batteries were low (brand new energizer max). Also she is only supposed to need the date and time set when batteries were replaced but the one we had did it every time we turned it off and back on(to save the batteries).Maybe ours was defective. Overall just not so amazing. The Julie doll I had about 10 years ago was better.
1,Another Bad Review!,"I purchased this doll for my 6 year old's birthday. After the (as mentioned) very long set up process, she was able to play with her. The next time my daughter went to play with her we had to reset the date and time again, and again, and again. Also, she did not recognize my daughter - EVER, and the batteries went dead VERY quickly - within the first two days. We exchanged her for a new doll thinking we had a lemon, however, the new doll is doing the very same thing. I plan to return her soon. My daughter is very frustrated with her. The only time she's really been able to play with her was after the LONG set up on the first day. Not at all worth $100, maybe $10! PLEASE - save your money!"
3,Did not recognize My Daughters Voice.,"The Doll was bought for my 3 yr old. I knew after reading reviews it may not recognize her voice since she may not speak clearly enough. I was shocked when i reprogrammed the doll with my 7 yr olds voice and only half the time did Amanda recognize her voice. The other half Amanda told my 7 yr old. ""You not my mommy"". If i had to rate this doll it would be a low 3. It was very frustrating for us all."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"This was the worst gift for my 5 (almost 6) daughter. We bought it for her for Christmas and she was SO excited. I read other reviews that said that the children need to be able to speak well. My daughter talked early and speaks very well so I thought it would be great. It's supposed to recognize her voice, but never does. It says ""you don't sound like Mommy"" and says ""let's play until Mommy gets home"" and my daughter says that Mommy is holding you!!! I think it frustrates my husband and I more than my daughter because she still plays with her. I still wouldn't recommend buying her - it's not worth the money and the frustration!!!"
3,This doll was too needy for my daughter,"I really hate to give this toy a wishy-washy 3 stars, BUT she did work the way she was billed, so I really can't give her just 1 star. Having said that, however, I'll tell you why I wish Amanda had never entered our lives. Amanda is needy. Really needy. My daughter played with her for awhile on the first day, but then we heard the following ""conversation"":Amanda: Mommy, can I put on my dress now?DD: Yeah. It's over there (pointing).These days, Amanda wakes up every day at 10am (thank goodness we didn't set an earlier wake up time), and talks for several minutes (it's kind of creepy - my husband and I have nicknamed her ""Chucky."") Maybe if my daughter were older, or more of a nurturing type, she would enjoy Amanda more."
1,Amazing Amanda was not so amazing,Amanda was purchased for my 4 year old. The doll was annoying. We set her up as instructed. The voice recognization feature is poor to say the least. Amanda DID NOT respond to my daughters voice at all no matter how load or clear she spoke. I called the 800 # supplied twice and it was forever busy (must have had lots of calls on this doll). I left messages and never received a call back.After changing the batteries 3 times and re-programming the doll 3 times my daughter lost interest and said she didn't want to play with her any more. Amanda was sent back for a full refund. Amazon is great to deal with.
1,OMG !!,HEY UMMM... MY NAME IS ANTONIA AND MY FRIEND VALENTINA GOT A NEW AMAZING AMANDA DOLL FOR CHRISTMAS AND WE TRY TO MAKE HER TALK WE PUT BATTERIES WE PRESSED EVERY SINGLE BUTTON SHE HAS . WE EVENPUT EVERY BATTERIE IN THEIR PLACE AND FINALLY SHE TALKED ASKED ABOUT THE DATE THE TIME AND EVEN PLAYED A LITTLE GAME WITH ME .BUT THEN SHE WENT TO SLEEP N ITS BEEN ABOUT AN HOUR ALREADY N AND SHE HASNT TALKED OR WOKEN UP .. PLEASE I NEED HELP . CAN U PUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HER UP ON INTERNET BECAUSE IM WAITING FOR HER TO TALK. ANYWAY I THREW AWAY THE INSTRUCTIONS!!
4,"Encourages, NOT Limits, The Imagination","If I read one more article on how the technological advancements of this doll limit the creativity and imagination of little girls, I may scream. Here we parents are, with our own technolgically advanced toys: camera phones, ipods, dsl, hdtv, etc; do we really think we can then turn around and expect our children to be happy with wooden blocks and tinker toys? We ALL - young and old - like Ralphie, prefer the Red Rider BB gun ""with a compass in the stock"" to a ball! Both educators and parents know that children learn through play. Even if the doll they play with has the bells and whistles of voice recognition, little girls will still learn. I fail to see how Amazing Amanda limits imagination. If anything, she stimulates the creative process. She encourages girls to role-play a very important job - that of a mother."
1,Plantronics MX153-SG3 Flexible Boom Headset,Too much interference. Might as well just buy Samsung's crappy headset because it is clear.
5,Great Headset!,I have had 3 different cell phones in the past year and everytime I get a new phone I HAVE to get the plantronics headset too! They work great and are very durable! I would definately recommend it to all folks that drive and talk on their cell phones.
1,Does Not Work!,The ear piece does not work! I can talk into the microphone however; I cannot hear anything through the earpiece.Do not waste your money on this product.
5,Very good headset,The only negative to the this headset is that the ear piece doesn't always fit very well in my ear. Aside from the it has worked perfectly.
4,Good pic,Odd how she played in a movie that parallel her later life. All n all a must see for the true Farrah fan.
1,Cheap!!!,"This dagger was very poorly designed. The tang (the part of the blade that extends through the handle) is simply a steel rod spot-welded onto the bottom of the blade. When I opened the box, the pieces were loose inside. The handle fell apart, the nut that was supposed the hold it all together was stripped, and wouldnt stay on the threaded bit of rod that stuck out of the pommel. I had to take the knife apart, use JB Weld on all the pieces, and let it set up before I was able to carry it. The dagger is part of a costume, and I dont have time to order another, otherwise I would have returned it. The only reason I gave this weapon 1 star is because Amazon wont let me give it 0."
3,Poor Chain,"No sooner was the item removed from the box, one of the holding chains that attach to the belt clip broke. Good thing I have a Frog on order so that I can carry this Dagger securely."
3,Decent blade but could have been better,"The box it arrived in was beat up and dusty and the blade was not secured down by anything so it was free to jostle around. The hilt looked fine and the blade was okay but all the metal hardware I have an issue with.It looks like when they put a clear coat over the metal pieces someone touched it before it was dry, leaving behind finger prints. Then it was clear coated again so I have a bunch of permanent finger prints embedded in the metal accents that can never be removed. I could disassemble everything, strip it and re-clear it all, but that would take far more time and effort than it is worth.Granted this is one blade out of the lot, so who knows, I may have just received the bad one. If you are thinking about buying this knife, all I can say is I hope you have better luck than I, it is still a great looking blade, I just have to admire mine from a far instead of up close."
5,Uncle,What a nice piece! It is all it is advertsied to be and then some. A handsome dagger worthy of a place on my wall.
2,Get Coached,"I was expecting a lot more from this video and book. The video is just a series of one liners, which is what I do all the time. I was hoping for some personal experiences behind the one liners. Very disappointed."
3,Selectively Good,"I wasn't so much of a fan of the album as a whole. But there were certain songs that the lyrics and music just got you going. I love Damita's voice. I'd go as far as to call her the Dorinda Clark Cole of today (don't kill me DCC fans. I know there's only one Dorinda).I'd recommend downloading the songs Why, Afraid, Life, Truth, and Hold On To your faith."
4,Good,Damita's album is a mix of a little of everything. A little alternative and r&b make her style unique and different. Enjoyable at the very least.
4,Damita,"I highly recommend Damita's new release Damita. The music has a lot of energy. The style of music is not just gospel. It crosses into ""pop"" with a great beat. I find teens really like this album."
5,Damita Wrecks The House!,"This album is must have for any gospel music lover's collection. The mix of Damita's tight vocals, funky instrumentals, and masterful production is second to none. Damita's debut release is one that shows her ability as an incredible songstress and her flexibilty between musical styles. The album is tough from beginning to end! You will be pleased to hear Damita rock the house in ""Hold on To Your Faith"" with a funky, headbanging, production. Damita is definitely one that displays her love in ""The Wedding Song"", this track is one that should be played at every wedding! This album is certainly a winner!"
5,The Spiritual Bomb!!,"This CD is a perfect addition to my Urban gospel collection which includes artists such as Tonex, Deitrick Haddon (her husband), Mary Mary, Montrel Darret, and many many more wonderful spirit-filled artists that I don't have room to mention. Damita Haddon has such a blessed and anointed voice she could've sung this whole album without music except that the beats are so TIGHT!!! There are a wide variety of sounds on this album from slow R&B to a funky rock joint ( and I don't even like rock). It is obvious this Detroit area resident has a fine career ahead of her. It's just one of those CD's that you put in the player, and play all the way through. It is sure to be a blessing to those looking for a R&B sound filled with the WORD instead of trash. Pick up this CD and be blessed!!!!"
4,Great Stand!,"This a very nice stand for the PS 2. It's very sturdy (with screw installation) and holds the PS 2 well in position. I have not used the memory card slots, since I have no need for them, so I can't comment on that feature's usefulness."
5,POWERFUL,THIS CD IS FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES SOOTHING GOSPEL.YOU CAN KICK YOUR SHOES OFF UNWIND AND GET INTIMATE WITH GOD. TRULY INSPIRATIONAL
5,BEFORE THEIR TIME,"iTS A LOT BETTER THAN THE LATEST ""URBAN GOSPEL"" OF NOWADAYS(2008)!ORIGINATORS OF URBAN GOSPEL. HAVEN'T HEARD THE ORTHER ALBUMS, DON'T NEED TO. THIS IS GOOD FROM BEGININ TA END. ITS BETTER THAN TODAY'S MUSIC BECAUSE ITS ORIGINAL AND GENUINE. MATCHING ALBUMS INCLUDE:MONTRELL DARRETT ""CHRONICLES OF THE SOUL""...... TAKE 6 ""JOIN THE BAND""......ERICK MATTHEWS ""NO FEAR IN ME""..... and COMMISSIONED.....FROM THE EARLY 90'S"
4,Look Out....,"Look out K.C. and JoJo, here are Dawkins and Dawkins. These guys are speaking the massage and keeping the beat. These two can really sing, not doctored up vocals like some of there peers. The music is really tight and grooving. The only reason I did not give them a 5 is because, some of the songs are a bit over simplified and does not seem to be complete. But, if you are looking for some good music with taste, this is the album for you."
2,The most boring movie I have ever seen!,"I'm a big fan of the indepedent genre, but this is not what I call a real film. This is somebody else's home movies of their family. I don't like watching my own home movies much less watching somebody else's. Now don't get me wrong, I loved Sherman's March. And it was because of that movie that made want to see this one. But I have to say, I was so disappointed. I fell asleep after watching the first hour. Take my advice into consideration, don't buy this video. I saw what Ross McElwee was trying to do with this but I just don't think that going through life with a camera strapped to your shoulder is the way to live. I mean, your family members don't want to be on tape 247, do they?"
4,A close connection,"From the compelling portrait on the front cover, the photographs are one of the strongest features of this book. There are full-page photos of gorilla hands and feet that would be wonderful for actual comparison to a young readers' hands and feet. And this comparison would support one of the key messages of this book: humans and gorillas are very much alike. Sometimes that similarity is not such a good thing; for example, as humans and gorillas come into closer contact, the apes are catching human diseases which are hard for them to fight. Gorilla Doctors describes the work of veterinarians and other scientists who are struggling to keep the great apes safe in the wild. The language is very accessible, and could even work for a read-aloud to a younger child who's particuarly interested in gorillas."
3,Not what I thought it was supposed to be,"I bought this item because I wanted to learn about vampire legends. It turns out to be just a few stories about superstitions that people have around the world, and most of them are not even about vampires."
1,Pomp and circumstance,"I really didn't care for this book. The author seemed lazy in his presentation. There were a lot of passages in other languages that weren't translated well and the typeset of them seemed poor. The author seemed more concerned with flaunting how much they knew instead of presenting the information in a way that was interesting and easy to follow. Most of the data is presented with very little context, making the references mean very little if you are trying to learn about vampires through the eyes of the people who crafted the legends.Yawn factor 9. Don't waste your time on this book."
5,Amazing Quality & Ease of Operation: Buy it at this price!,"I could not be more pleased with my purchase and use of the Panasonic ""55."" Hours now spent in airports, on planes, in hotels and on longer ""road"" trips speed by. The battery REALLY lasts 3 hours, and 55 is so easy to operate that my 3 year old granddaughter turns it on and watches it, transfixed, for as long as her favorite Disney DVD lasts. Quality? Home theater quality sound and picture, esp'ly with earphones. Screen too small for enjoyment? Dont believe it for a moment; the screen is so close it is NO problem. Price? $... is great, esp'ly when compared to other Portables. Any needed accessory? Yes. Get a recharger for the car/plane. Panasonic advertizes it, but i havent seen it offered yet by Amazon. But perhaps i havent looked hard enough."
1,"It is claimed to be a seven-volume set, but I got only one volume","It is claimed to be a seven-volume set, but after a long time of waiting, I received only the second volume, a worn-out book. I think the owner of the books should be honest in describing the products, even used books. At least a single book should not be described as a seven-volume set!It is definitely the worst shopping experience on Amazon.com."
1,used product was sold as new,"The dictionary was purchased as a new item. It was a gift. To my surprise, the product was used, broken on two spines and had a child's handwriting on the inside of volume 1. It was very disappointing. While the encyclopedia is wonderful and being enjoyed thoroughly by the recipient, items should not be sold as new when they are clearly used (and damaged). It is deceptive and the price should have been considerably less. There is no problem with buying used items, but sellers should be required to disclose this in advance as a normal part of their practice of selling items online. I would not have purchased the item had I known the set was used."
4,"Came fast, great quality","Came like a week after i ordered it,combat ready blade, came with some survival stuff in the handle; matches, fishing line + hook, stuff like that. The only problem is the compass in the handle was rattling around the box before i even opened it. I glued it on with ease."
3,Not Too Shabby...,"This is a big, powerful knife with all the standard survival features. It's straight out of the Rambo movies!It's also closer to the mediocre side when it comes to quality craftsmanship."
2,heavy and unsharp knife,"well, if you don't know how to sharpening a knife because you are physical retarded, then this is not the knife for you. because out of box, the knife is not very sharp at all. I am sure you can't kill a pig with this.but other that, this is a great knife. I would highly recommended, for the price, quality, metal,weight and made in china. The little compass works just fine, but the head of 2 out of 3 match is cracked."
4,"Overall good, but start at the beginning.","I am a big Bettie Eadie fan. I really loved her book ""Embraced by the Light"". This is a good book worth reading but in my opinion it doesn't much compare with her first book. Probably because in this book she mentiones how her first book was inspired but doesn't say that this one is. I have just purchased her third book ""The Ripple Effect"" and I hope that will be good too."
3,Long time fan of Betty - Now I have found a 'match' for her,"I have always enjoyed Betty's books and similar authors. Now I have become a big fan of a book and author even more revealing! I refer to the newly released book Where Heavens Meet by k.t. Frankovich. Value for money there is no comparison either, as it includes incredible full page colour photos. I have not read Betty's 3rd book yet, but I doubt it will match up to Where Heavens Meet"
4,"Good, but no ""Embraced""","This is a very enlightening book. It can help you to understand your spiritual self. This is not as awe-inspiring as ""Embraced by the Light"" but I definitely recommend this one to any person trying to understand themself and God."
2,still waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,my father ordered this item about a last Saturday for my birthday that passed yesterday and im still waiting. This was not a gift from him to me it was paid for by his credit card and for that he took out the money for it and the shipping was on him We are thinking of canceling. Was said to be here a day ago and didnt ship yet: pretty pissed.
4,LifeSource One Step Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor is Good At-Home Tool,"The monitor is easy to use. The user booklet is easy to understand and helps with settings when you start. I don't really use the memory feature, but it is there if I need it. I like having the time display when I take my blood pressure. It can be used with batteries or with plug in. My only reservation is the variability in readings. I plan to take it to my doctor's office to see how it measures up with their monitor. I have an older model and have liked it very much. This is a very good product. I recommend it for those who need to track their blood pressure."
4,Good device,"Have only used this monitor for a week, but seems to do a great job. Small, compact, reliable, and easy to read display. Had an ""err"" message come up once, but I think that may have been due to the operator. Do appreciate the Lifetime Warranty. Initially tried using with the AC adapter to save on batteries, but then switched to batteries; one less wire to clutter the desk. The memory feature is cool, computes the average ...... and you can scroll back through storage if you didn't get to write down numbers before auto power-off (which I think could be delayed just a tad longer)."
1,Doesn't live up to the reviews,"I purchased this monitor because it was touted as having 'the best features' of any on the market. And the features are great.Amazon's shipping service is excellent as always. UNFORTUNATELY,IT IS INACCURATE. This monitor was consistently 20 points different from my standard blood pressure cuff and an Omron. I expected some difference, but not that much, and so returned it."
5,Excellent unit at a better price,This unit had high reviews at a number of sources and we've not been disappointed. Amazon price was 50% less than we found for same unit at medical supply stores - and those didn't include an AC adapter. Readings were confirmed accurate by doctor.
2,LifeSource UA-767PAC,"The UA-767PAC which I received gave inaccurate and erratic readings compared with another blood pressure monitor of verified accuracy. Other than that, it was convenient to use and operated reliably."
5,A good tool that provides peace of mind,This machine allows me to take my Mother's blood pressure as well as pulse. As a caregiver of a heart failure patient with a-fib being able to know these readings for sure has been a tremendous relief. I would recommend this item to anyone who is caring for a parent.
4,It works,"The product description given by Amazon for the medium sized cuff is wrong.It states ""The UA-767PV includes a medium arm cuff size which has a range of 7.5"" to 12.2""If you look up the description for LifeSource UA-280 Blood Pressure Monitor Cuff, that product description actually says Medium (9.4"" - 14.2""). 9.4"" - 14.2"" is the correct size of the cuff that comes when you order the UA-767 monitor with medium cuff."
4,It works...,I have never purchased a monitor for blood pressure before and I read many reviews online about different manufacturers before I purchased this one. It performs so far as promised and seems to be of quality manufacture. My only complaint is that when it reaches it's full inflation it really is a bit painful in the cuff until it starts to release pressure and take the reading. But it is not so bad that I don't use it or want to return it.I have not compared it at the same time to a doctor's or nurses monitor in a clinic for example but it seems to be around the same readings as when I last went for a check-up.
1,Problem Cuff,"I attempted to use this item several times on myself and my dad with poor results. The cuff length is adjustable via a loosely fitting metal bar. When the cuff is inflated on the arm, the bar allows the cuff lenght to expand and/or the velcro closure does not hold. Result is an unacceptable number of repeat attempts and unrelaible readings. I returned it to Amazon."
3,"works well, but not as easy as older model","I purchased this to replace an older model that had become unreliable. This model works, but not quite as easy to use. The cuff is more difficult to place properly. Otherwise, is very good and seems to be reading accuretly."
4,Seems accurate when compared with doctor visit.,Unit came with full instructions. Cuff works well using one hand to attach. Seems to be accurate. I wish that there was a way to track more than one user over time.
5,Easy Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor,This blood pressure monitor is easy to use and accurrate. The price was competitive.
4,good but boring,"This was my first Tony Little workout video. It is very intense with using both weightlifting and aerobics and it will make you sweat. Tony was also good at trying to motivate us during the workout. But it also appears cheaply done. Tony stands on a gray carpeted circle with purple sparkles around it, kind of looks like a UFO, with just a plain black background. It is pretty boring to watch so I haven't used it as much as other workout videos."
2,Review of Policies and Procedures for LTCF,The CD doesn't contain the same fonts and formats as the written text. Not overly impressed.
2,Not impressed.,"It's not clear who this book is for. If you've worked in corporate America, then you already know this stuff. If you are a student without much work experience, the coverage is too shallow for you to really learn anything from the text book."
3,Kung Phooey,"The movie over all was not that funny. Ace Ventura was funny, Kung Pow was funny but this movie just didn't push my funny bone to the thresh hold."
3,"At times, funny!","This movie is ok, the humor is slap stick and dry, to the point where at first it is funny, but stupid and pointless. The whole movie is a parody of the whole kung fu movie genre and the people of this ethnic background.The acting is mediocre, the actors are very B-list, or maybe C. The plot of the movie is simple and worthless, there are no or little fighting scenes, there will be funny moments at times, reference to many things, very simple and entertaining.Overall ok movie, not the best movie, but delivers entertainment for the whole family, even though it is rated ""R"", for no reason."
4,FUNNY!,"I must say that after seeing ""Kung Pow"" I wasn't expecting much from ""Kung Phooey!"" But this comedy ""spoof"" had me laughing out loud in parts and I liked that the jokes are on different levels: Some skewer Hollywood sterotypes, others, martial arts movies and actors. I can't understand the ""R"" rating, since there's no nudity, foul language or gory violence - if anything, it's just plain silly in parts. The kids even thought it was funny.Don't expect big budget effects from this independent effort, but there's a laugh in there for everyone. Great entertainment!"
5,Kung Phooey is an awesome slap stick comedy,This is an awesome slapstick comedy for those who like to get some laughs. It's about time a comedy was made for the Chinese American generation! I can relate to the humor and the culture of the story. I hope they come out with Kung Phooey II!
4,Surpisingly entertaining and funny film.,"This film is almost impossible to describe in words. We have all seen the kung fu movies of the last few decades and the spoofs that followed. This film did not have to be a kung fu film to be funny. The comedic aspects of this film and the supurb delivery by the actors could stand on it's own. There is not as much action as a full blown martial arts film, so don't buy this expecting fights every 5 minutes, but if you are looking for a refreshingly funny film with new faces, well executed scenes, and a cast that can actually pull off the fights, then this is your movie.I am not certain, but I believe the R rating may have been due to the recognition of racial sterotypes. What a shame! Getting dinged for the very thing you are trying to educate people about. This movie is easily a PG rating."
5,"Sitacise Sit, Get Fit & Save America Video Fitness Book!","Great for Baby Boomers, kids, those who want to get a good workout anywhere without killing themselves. Can be done anywhere, even while your at work, school or playing video games! Great! Great! Great! Never miss a workout again!"
4,Another intriguing couple,"Dunstan and Leila are opposites in so many ways -- enough so that one might wonder how long the happiness will last -- but their doubts and uncertainties cause them to see beyond their differences. Because she is Dunstan's employer and is accepted in society, Leila often has the upper hand. But Dunstan's acceptance and encouragement of her Malcolm gifts frees Leila to be the woman she desires to be.Leila can be a bit manipulative, but she has used her looks, her social skills, and, at times unwittingly, her magical abilities to secure her acceptance in society and eventually to aid Dunstan. He, on the other hand, comes across as gruff and unsociable, but his heart is sensitive and noble. The inner people are much better matched than the outer ones. The mystery of his wife's murder is kept at an interesting level and does not overshadow the romance. Leila's difficulty in discovering and harnessing her unique gift is a highlight of this book."
1,Not funny,"The movie had a good cast and the previews were very funny, but when I received the movie and started to watch I was very disappointed. I lost interest very soon and didn't even bother to watch the entire movie."
3,Just okay,"I bought this thinking the stories would be great, but I was more interested in the artwork. The stories are just okay."
1,Way too early,"I got this CD from as a gift from someone who knows about my taste for Miles Davis and who tried to find something that wasn't already in my collection. I appreciate the gesture, but if this is what is left beyond the Miles Davis CDs I already own, then I'll stick with what I already have.I kept waiting for Miles Davis' powerful entry, and when the CD of old fashioned blues (with only a touch of jazz) finished I was still waiting. Turns out this was way too early Davis for the music to be constructed around him. On this recording, Miles Davis plays a bit part that is at best difficult to pick out and is in any case a scandalous reason for putting the man's name on the cover.I see a fellow reviewer came to a similar conclusion -- I wish my friend read the review before paying for this CD. This is one recording that won't be enjoying playing time at my house."
5,great sewing tote,"i just love this sewing tote. it really holds alot of items and there are three places to put things so i dont have to dig and dig for my things. i have a smaller one also that is also great. this is great for holding everything i need for one project. or i just change it around to put my doll clothes making supplies. it doesnt take up alot of room on my sewing table. its easy to open and i can see in to see what is there. its not transparent, which is the only thing i might have changed about it. but it is translucent and nice and sturdy.i looked and looked for it in stores and never saw anything i liked better. i'm really enjoying it and can recomend it to anyone."
4,Challenging the thinking,"Most people who read about Jesus in the gospels tend to look only at the biblical information and draw their conclusions only from there. McKnight challenges the thinking by taking a sociological perspective and applying that viewpoint to what else we know about Jesus. This is a good book, worth the reading of anyone who wants to meditate on the work of Jesus in conversion."
1,stinky,The worst thing he has every done it was cheap and i feel it should have been free. katt williams was it the for about 1.5 minutes if you blink you will miss him. he shouldn't be on the cover as if he is doing stand up on the movie. I returned the movie it was so bad
3,STICK TO RAPPING,I MAY NOT BE FROM THE HOOD BUT EVEN I KNOW THIS IS NOT FUNNYTHERE IS ONE AFRICAN GUY WHO IS OK BUT THE OTHERS ARE terribleGET THE FILM REPOS - THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THE SOUNDTRACK YOU GET BUT THE DVD ITSELF IS SOMETIMES HARD TO WATCH.TELL PERCY MILLER STICK TO RAPPING -
4,Michael Blackson Owned this DVD!,"I'll admit it, I hate this dvd but Michael Blackson saved it from getting thrown in the trash. Michael Blackson had me laughing from the beginning of his session to the end! I hope Master P paid his @$$ alot of money for saving that dvd. I really buy the Gutter Music Realease dvd for the soundtracks and they never seem to disapoint me. I liked the soundtrack on this dvd but I'm going to recommend that everyone buy's The movie that comes with the soundtrack ""Gods Gift"" by Romeo. The movie is good and the soundtrack is more like a full lenght album! It also comes with about 4 videos."
2,"Master P Presents The Hood Stars of Comedy, Vol. 1",I was very disappointed with this comedy dvd presented by Master P. The comedians were not funny and the quality of the video was unprofessional looking and dark. Just seemed like it was thrown together quickly. I cannot tell you have aggravated I was thinking about the money I spent for this dvd. Buyers beware.
4,all REPRINTS ....argh!,"Why do they do this? Why can't they be bothered to buy new work from these writers? I want new stories. New material.:::quiet sobbing::::I was so eager for my Christmas candy, I didn't pay close enough attention. I should have known that Emma Jensen hadn't broken her silence.Waaaaaaahhhhh It's worse than opening a Christmas present and finding out that it's the same one you gave to that person last year. Okay, maybe not that tacky but pretty damned close.I only gave it four stars because I don't blame the authors and I think they're the ones that are more affected by stars. (I didn't love the Heath one but the others all produce that happy sigh a really good sappy story can give)"
3,it's ok,i got this book because the price was so low. I love the recency period. this book was not my favorite.
3,Something for Everyone,"More like 3.5 stars. This book contains five short stories set around Christmas time. Some were better than others.Five stars. Carla Kelly's LET NOTHING YOU DISMAY is the best. Two good people on the outskirts of 'proper' society share their hopes and dreams with each other. A sweet story.Edith Layton's BEST WISHES and Barbara Metzger's THE LUCKY COIN each rate four stars for their interesting twist on people who discover the true meaning of Christmas.I didn't care for Sandra Heath's MERRY MAGPIE, an unbelievable tale of adultery and forgiveness. Also, Emma Jensen's FOLLOWING YONDER STAR stretched the imagination; a man who was always on the move suddenly found love, even though he knew her most of his life. One star apiece."
4,Just the thing to put you in the old fashioned Christmas spirit!,"This is a wonderful, light hearted collection of stories that are perfect for putting the reader in the Christmas spirit. The detail is accurate, the mood is perfect, and the end result is an uplifting experience. I strongly recommend this book!"
3,Entertaining B thriller,"Helen and her brother-in-law, David, kidnaps Helen's husband Ben, to get the ransom money from his company. But things don't go as planned and Ben and an FBI agent gets killed. Afterwards, the agent's partner and Helen become friends and, before long, also lovers. But strange things start to happen. Is Ben still alive? Does David have plans of his own? Something is wrong...This is a grade B thriller made for TV. While not the best movie in the world (I don't think anyone expected it to be), it does its job - to entertain, and does it quite well. It is an entertaining movie with just enough twists in the plot to make it interesting. At least worth renting."
2,Disappointing ...,"The movie has a good start. It fails to maintain the initial energy and suspense, and falls apart after the first ten minutes, becoming a lack-luster bore.What is the movie about? Greed, conspiracy, cross and double-cross as Ben Algood, husband of Bo Derek's character, is presumably kidnapped. Oh no, oh woe. Who cares? Not Bo."
5,One of my favorites,"This is one heck of a CD. It will transport you to other times and places, to poignant memories and emotions. If you like piano solo music, and classical piano, you'll love this. He's also an amazing live performer. I saw him open for k.d. lang and I was blown away!"
5,Life always has its surprises...,"Dustin O'Halloran's music came into my life, like many other things, as a great but fortunate coincidence. In this album, the member of Devics, delivers a set of straight up classical piano compositions (including ""Opus #7"", also released with Devics) that leave the listener with a sense of having heard Max Richter or Philip Glass without any embellishing ornaments or background keyboards to accompany the piano. Quite simply, it's an album you can listen to once and again and never grow tired of, with the word ""never"" being the most important one, since the sound in the album has a fairly timeless quality that will definitely make it sound just as fresh and touching in 20, 50 or 100 years as it does today, over five years after its original release. You can buy it with absolute confidence."
5,"Parish is a living, breathing, show biz encyclopedia","He not only gathers information that would otherwise require assistance from the CIA or NSA, he disseminates it in a lively, juicy, easy-to-read manner. He bridges the gap between researchers and the everyday yahoo who wants to know the most salacious details of Hollywood royalty acting like the pampered, indulgent maniacs they often are. One would expect this kind of all-encompassing, zippy, definitive collection from Parish, who has mastered this form, and he does not disappoint."
5,"""Bad Boys"" Make Good Reading","This is one of those great books you start flipping through because you recognize a lot of the names. And let's be honest, when it comes to the rich and famous, we all enjoy hearing a little bit of scandal. What's best about this book is that it doesn't stick solely to the headline troublemakers of today like Robert Downey Jr. and Hugh Grant. The book goes back in time to actors like Montgomery Clift and John Wayne (who wasn't always the noble cowboy he appeared) as well as to actors I had never even heard of. Because those stories were new to me, they were the ones I found most fascinating. The book does a great job covering the scope of Hollywood's darker history."
4,Vampire novel set in Revolutionary France,"This seems to be the novel before Midnight Gamble. Nicole Radoux is the daughter of a vampire and a mortal. When she finds out about her father, she runs away to Paris, only to discover that she is more like him than she thought. She is taken in by Marchand Valois and his brother and finds herself in love with him. She also runs into some old ""friends"" of her father's, Bianca, the evil vampire who changed him and Gerardo, a puzzling mix of friend and enemy. Nicole needs to find out how to control her nature and they offer to teach her. But does Bianca want to help Nicole or destroy her father. Nicole also might not be able to save her mortal friends from the immortal ones.This is an enjoyable escape type of book. The setting is very good for the type of novel and the characters very vivid. An entertaining and fast read."
2,"Functionally, not that great","Unfortunately, this game is not one for a board game enthusiast. The very fact that my friends and I have watched Simpsons ad nauseum since 1989 makes this game even less fun. I can only play this game with a close circle of a couple people since occational viewers immediately feel intimidated--not by me, but rather by the fan-oriented questions. Like other reviewers stated, this game works best simply as trivia cards to read through with other fans.If you are looking for fun classic games like ""Scrabble"" and ""Monopoly"" or new games like ""Wise and Otherwise"" are a much more reliable source. This game has too small of a target audience to have wide appeal."
5,works wonders,Is fantastic for olive oil.. OO is very expensive so it good to use a product like this so ur sure to get the best use out of ur OO.. Works perfect no issues what so ever.. Remember to only fill it about half way because it does need room inside for the air u pump in.. And make sure to use all the air inside before opening it or if there is oil and air inside and u open well u might just feel like ur in some kind of adult party..
4,Great,It works as it should. We've had it for several months and it works fine. Remember to release the pressure after your done using it though.
1,Very poor product,"I ordered the Trudeau and a Misto spray pumps at the same time. I normally don't write reviews; and I order a lot from Amazon. The Trudeau is not worth the extra money. There is hardly any mist, just a stream, and that is when it wants to work. The Misto is great! It has like an atomizer at the end of the tube which the Trudeau lacks(just a straight tube). I just know that the Misto does the job and the Trudeau does not."
2,Worked great! For a short time,"We loved this pump for the first several months after buying it. And then it started to leak oil onto my hand when I'd go to use it. I'm not sure if it's something we did wrong, but it ended up being useless - no more spray, just leaking."
1,"Sprayed at first,","But after about 9 months, will only put out a lazer-like stream of oil. I've tried all different fill and pressure levels, nothing makes any difference. This purchase was money wasted."
4,Not Lost In Translation,"This is not a review, but just a comment. There are several versions of Death In Venice for sale through Kindle. I have read samples from them all. Michael Henry Heim's translation is the most expensive, but well worth the few extra dollars. Mann's language is of the older, more stilted and long winded variety to our modern sensibilities. This translation compared to the others is more natural, readable and poetic. It retains the complexity without stumbling over the difficulties into what might be a bumbling translation full of odd English. If you really want a smooth natural flow of language, don't bother with the earlier translations."
4,A little repetative at times but no the less a Classic Read,"A death in Venice is a classic story which I recommend to those seeking this literary category. The book gets repetative at times with Gustav's obsession over the boy, but that's what forces the reader to stay glued to the plot."
1,Wrong Sizing!,Very disappointing to get these shoes. We were told specifically to order the same size as street shoes and this is clearly wrong. They are two sizes too small. Hope this is corrected for others. The shoes also don't look nearly as nice as the picture.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"For the past few years, I have given my family a grab bag of colognes as Christmas gifts. This one will certainly be one that will be ""given"" away once they smell it."
5,"A useful, interesting, and fun book","I was introduced to 'Crime Scene Investigations' while attending a teaching workshop. I ordered it right away for my high school level Criminal Justice class. It is full of experiments which apply to virtually every unit my class covers. With the help of the book, I have set up a classroom Crime Lab, of which I am quite proud. We are able to perform an astounding number of experiments, and the lab causes quite a stir with our visitors.As a retired police officer, I am very aware of the validity of the lessons presented in 'Crime Scene' and feel they would be of value to any of my students who decide on a career in Law Enforcement."
4,Crime Scene Teacher Investigates Book,Book is filled with easy to do and fun labs for middle school students. Labs also inform students on forensic facts and vary for teachers who may or may not have much science lab equipment. Labs and Worksheets are easy to run off for student use.Crime Scene Investigations: Real-Life Science for Grades 6-12
1,Tried this product and on strict candida diet,This product did nothing for me... no changes... tried other products that did make a difference like CANDEXand Three Lac... this was like taking nothing at all for my Systemic Candidais! Those who receive results must have light cases of Candida.
2,Couldn't get rid of my yeast,"I finished the bottle, and I still have oral thrush and candida in my digestive tract. It didn't work for me."
4,Chronic Candida sufferers,"This products does work, but it works best in conjunction with (Thorne Research - Bacillus Coagulans), this is my choice. If your GI tract is in the state of chronic dysbiosis which mine is and has been for years you will need something to first balance out the bacterial imbalance then secondly take care of the yeast overgrowth. The probiotic you choose will have to be strong enough to survive a hostile environment in your gut after passing through your stomach acid.If you follow my advice take the Thorne Research - Bacillus Coagulans with 100 pure Aloe Vera Juice (Lily of the Field) it will result in a much deeper penetration in your gut. You may start to suffer a Herxheimer reaction but continue and along with a good restrictive Candida diet this should enhance its cleansing effect even more."
2,did not notice any difference or change,"I never had any ""die off"" symptoms, and I felt great the whole time I took it. Only one day did I feel ""extra anxious"" and emotional, which I wouldn't necessarily blame on the candida cleanse...might try another brand."
2,Too little content,"This is a good start but this video is more of a promotional for the author's classes than a real production. When you strip the intro, video special effects (for better production value just watch TV) you are left with 4 solid 4 minute sections. This tape should have 16 such segments to merit 5 stars"
2,too small,"This backpack is way too small, eventhough it says it's toddler size. Too small even for a toddler... I wanted it for my daughter to take to school... Not good for that.. Need a bigger one now.."
3,It was to small.,I kept it but I will have to buy another backpack because it is to small I thought it was bigger.
4,Taking me back home!,"Bobby D ""RULES""!...His style is unmatched.. with Richard ""HUMPTEY"" Vission taking a close second.....""BAD BOY BILL"" Has gone Astray and taking a softer side of house sounds with his aquired Discoie track using....Bobby D's ""Deep House""track & Sampling say's it all...since I've relocated to Southern Indiana,and being away from my native chicagoland with out some""KILLER HOUSE""!...this alblum brings back that "" I'm Feeling back at home again!"
5,Excellent Resource,"This book was the text my instructor assigned in an interpersonal communication class I took a few years ago. It is very readable, as are all books by the Coreys. It covers a wide range of topics and it uses case examples to illustrate the points. It isn't a counselling book in terms of having alot of exercises on questioning or empathy. It does discuss counselling skills, but it is more concerned with the worker's personal development, in terms of ethics, self-awareness, self-care, etc. The suggested activities at the end of the chapter really help the learning process. My only criticism of the book is that a few of the chapters are a tad long."
3,Required Reading,It was required reading for a class. Not my favorite book because of the heavy emphasis on counseling. Some of my other classmates really liked it though.
4,Not compatible with Pullrite Superglide on bed rails,"This is a very well-made hitch lock and I wish I could give it five stars instead of four. It even has a cap that goes over the keyway to protect it from weather. Unfortunately, this item is incompatible with my Pullrite Superglide hitch. The diameter of the shank is fine, but the compartment which houses the lock assembly is too thick to slide between the shank and the bed rail. If the shank were 1"" longer, it would have extended far enough where this wouldn't have been an issue. (I bought this based on the review of rlpax, who probably has a different type of fifth wheel hitch.)"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"No way to play with it. You can put it together sitting on a surface that can support it. Once you go to pick it up, even gently, it falls apart. VERY disappointing buy. My son got 2 for Christmas. I personally suggested them, but I never will again. Nice concept, but terrible design."
3,Toe comb separators -purchased through Amazon,"Thank you =--- these foam toe comb separators are perfect. The other brands had no life at all after a few days. They squashed and were like cotton candy and worthless.These are far superior and I will be reordering them again. I have severe painful hammertoes, and these help tremendously. Thanks again and again.Annette"
3,Older version,"It's an older version, but it gets the job done. Good subway read. Although, I ended up getting the app on my android because it's easier to carry around my phone than the book."
2,Super tiny,"I guess I should have measured out the 10"" but I was expecting much stronger, longer cords. These are very tiny."
4,Two for the price of one,"With this one CD comprised of songs from two separate sessions and two different iterations of McLean's band, this is really like getting two CD's for the price of one. Although the quintet only plays on three songs, two of them, Quadrangle and Fidel, are hot, hot, hot. Then the sextet picks it up where the quintet leaves off, smokin' on Appointment in Ghana, getting loose on Isle of Java (which I'm surprised they didn't call Isle of Jive-ah), and the indomitable Street Singer. Overall, the recordings are crisp and clean and feature the superb handling of Rudy Van Gelder and the high quality of Blue Note. Liner notes include the originals and updated ones and both are generous. None of the tracks can be passed over or squeezed out of a play list - Jackie makes everything go in equal measure, so the effect is some very enjoyable, up beat, bop-til-you-drop jazz. It's hard to say 'no' when Jackie invites you to have a look in his bag."
2,Didn't work as a barrier,"Does help keep my Dexcom on longer, but does not help with skin irritation of my omnipod. Very sticky and removal wipes don't really do the job. Smells like paint thinner."
4,Works Well and Worth the Mess,"I purchase the Skin Tac for my 13 year old son with Type 1 Diabetes. It is a little messy, but is worth it not to have to reinsert the pump apparatus every day. With the Skin Tac, we only have to change every 3 days, without it, we are changing daily (especially after a shower).It is worth the mess."
5,Great show - sometimes streaming was an issue,Great show - sometimes streaming was an issue. Love shows where it is 100% positive. No fighting and bickering. Done
5,Superb Horror; Devilishly Detailed,"In the last ten years, Masterton's horror work has benefitted from his historical romance fiction.This book is not one for ""Civil War Buffs"" but is a book for people who like Supernatural Horror with a very detailed historical background.Masterton's craft at this style of popular fiction is getting better and better. His research skills are as excellent as ever, but it is his presentation of the material that gets better and better.Masterton's real key is the story weave. He shows fairly extreme ultra-violence, and gradually draws together the threads of occult themes in various forms, and in his usually tantalizing manner, creates a very intriguing tapestry of superb horror, scarey supernatural elements, increasingly witty comments, and historically hysterical moments that always leaves the Masterton fans ( and non fans ) wanting more.ENJOY"
4,A definite suspense book,"I was really suprised at how much enjoyment I got from this book. The lead character, Detective Decker, had me rolling with laughter at some points with his witty dialouge and the gore factor was pretty high in this book. The way the mysterious killer deals with his victims is pretty gut-wrenching (you'll get this pun once you read the book). I also liked the fact that it involved a theme I haven't had very much experience reading about, in this case it's Santeria, a magic much more powerful than voodoo but similar.This book is definitely not a classic piece of literature by any means but if you like suspense and you like it gory with a dab of humour, then this is the book for you. I recommend it for a quick read (I read this in one sitting, it's only 350 pages and the font and type are a respectable size) and I think you'll enjoy it."
5,"Wow, what a different, awesome book.","For Civil War history buff's that love horror and some humor, try this book out. It has to do with black magic from Africa that is release into today's world. While I had issues with Decker and how he treats people, I think towards the end he more than made up for his laziness and his respect for other people. The excitement starts from the beginning and does not end there. This is a must have for any true horror fan as Graham Masterton is the MASTER of horror. Try his other books....Picture of Evil, Walkers, the Manitou, Revenge of the Manitou and so on."
2,Kinda boring,"Not the best mix. Very typical, mindless dance tunes. None stand out other than track 2. The mix of Purple is absolutely amazing. Worth buying for just that song as you can probably get it for a few dollars."
1,The Truth (Suggested Reading),As a counterweight to this book consider:1) Impostor : How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy (Hardcover)by Bruce Bartlett2) American Theocracyby Kevin Phillipshttp://www.americantheocracy.net/
1,Conservative without a Conscience,"It is evident that this author is exactly what John Dean speaks of in his new book ""Conservatives without a Conscience."" Looking back on the development of conservative politics in the U.S., Dean notes that conservatism is regressing to its authoritarian roots. Dean draws on five decades of social science research that details the personality traits of what are called ""double high authoritarians"": self-righteous, mean-spirited, amoral, manipulative, bullying. He concludes that Chuck Colson, Pat Robertson, Newt Gingrich, and Tom DeLay are all textbook examples. Dean calls Vice-President Cheney ""the architect of Bush's authoritarian policies,"" and deems Bush ""a mental lightweight with a strong right-wing authoritarian personality.""...To view a short piece on Dean's book go to[...]"
3,Laura's best,"Just getting to know the songs, but the songs from her Christmas Beads of Sweat Album are hard to beat."
2,"Great music, terrible sound quality","I always appreciated the engineering of this album back when I listened to it on vinyl in the early 70s. In headphones it was near-perfect. I bought the tracks today and I was incredibly disappointed at the inconsistent sound quality. In particular, ""Stoney End"" has so much distortion I actually checked my headphones and switched to another pair before I realized the recording was at fault. It sounds like their source recording was a worn out copy of the LP, played it with a bad stylus.Seriously, it's embarrassing that Amazon would charge $8.99 for this, apparently without exerting any quality control. Next time, have a qualified engineer listen to the tracks before you put them up for sale. If this is the norm for Amazon digital reissues of classic vinyl, I'll just start transcribing my own LPs instead of paying Amazon to do it. I can do a far better job than they did."
4,Early music by Nyro is an rarely heard classic.,"Lauro Nyro is probably best known for the songs she has written that have been performed by others. Although ""Wedding Bell Blues"" is a standard as performed by the Fifth Dimension, Ms. Nyro's version of her own music is soul satisfying. She did not seek out the limelight to the degree that other performers did and this was a loss to us; it has meant that her albums are hard to find and her beautiful songs are rarely played on the air. Her strong, warm vocals are perfectly set in the piano performances of each song on this album. This classic collection belongs with other ""must haves"" like Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" and Carole King's ""Tapestry"". You will not be disappointed by this CD/Album. Her voice and talent is still as rich and fun as it was when I first listened in my early college days 25 years ago. Enjoy."
5,EXCELLENT!! A MUST HAVE FOR PENDULUM STUDY & WORK!,"Out of all my pendulum books this is gonna be my favorite! I think their introduction said it best. ""This book supplies practical material that makes working with the pendulum easier. The instructions are brief and to the point. Instead of long-winded explanations, you'll get precise visual commentaries. It's not the purpose of this book to enter deeply into the philosophy of swinging the pendulum, nor to explore the energies that are behind it. But, of course, that doesn't mean that you couldn't benefit from researching that in other pendulum books."" It is all that and more! The best charts I've ever seen in a pendulum book! The overall design of the charts are visually inspiring and beautiful! My only small complaint is I wish when these designers design pendulum books with charts they would plan to make them spiral bound so they lay flat. Other than that miniscule problem... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!! YOU'RE GONNA LOVE WORKING WITH IT!!!!"
3,It serves the purpose,"This software is pretty good, even though I have seen better. With Video Link Mailpro 2.0 you are able to send moving images (not just still pictures) over the internet at a pretty fast rate. It is easy to use and does the job. If you are looking for something basic but reliable...this is for you!"
3,Junk label repackage/boot of the 1969 Jubilee Lp from 1980,"The original Lp was on Jubilee 8031, has a gorgeous, just beautiful full color cheesecake photo cover on front and back, on ""dimpled"" heavy paperstock. The Emus retread is the original recordings and worthwhile for any Emmylou fan, provided you get the Emus junker/bootleg for, well, cheap. If you're an Emmylou fan, the recordings will come off as fairly crude or unfinished, uncomfortable. This album was really loaded into the budget/cutout bins about 1979-80. Think of this as one of those reissue albums on Pickwick--same kind of quality pressing.Update: U.S. Federal Appeals court, 5/31/84, Judge A. Wallace Tashima, awarded Emmylou Harris a judgement against the reissue on Emus (Roulette Records), $34,000 in attorney fees and $60,000 for copyright infringement."
2,Interesting... but awful,"I found this LP in a cut-out bin at the local record store about 20 years ago, and since I was a fan of Emmylou's music, I bought it. Her singing wasn't very good at this point (very pitchy) and it is sort of amateurish. I later read a news article that she had sued the company or person who owned the rights to this record to prevent it from being re-released after she had success with her first several albums. It's more of a novelty in my opinion. Not a good performance."
3,not impressed,This book is a misrepresentation. it is not a book that will help with competition at all. It is a book of basics. It you are a beginner or looking for just the basics then this book is for you. No serious drills or competition advice will be found in this book.
3,Not as billed...,"This is simply not a book for advanced judoka, and likely will be old hat to the intermediates. While this text is probably one of the most visually appealing in terms of photos and layouts, many of the photos are simply fluff (tomoe-nage in the surf? Seriously?) The treatment of the various techniques is no more advanced than good ol' Kodokan Judo, and sometimes less so. I guess from the title (and the reputation of the author) I was expecting something more along the lines of the Masterclass series, not another rehash of the basics."
4,Judo Simple,"This book offers a great guide for a martial art student to understand. It is really good for understanding the mechanics needed for ""throws."" The pictures in the book are great. NOTE: NO martial art should be tried without the supervision of a trained professional"
2,Easily De-furred Kitties,"I loved these when my daughter first got them for Christmas. They were pretty, their arms and legs moved, and the little clothes were ""oh so adorable"". Two weeks later they were naked kitties, and it's not just the fact that my child didn't have the dexterity required to put the clothes back on, she had loved them, and played them so much the short velveteen type fur had all rubbed off, and they became naked plastic as well. They got dirty easily, the clothing was all lost very quickly, and they became quite ugly. About two months after she received them, my daughter sent the cat family permanently to the toy tote where they stayed for a very long time without being played with.These would be super for a child around the age of nine, who can get their clothes on and off without mommy help, and will display them more than play with them. They need a child who will not love them to death in as short a time as my six year old did."
5,Simply angelic,I first purchased this in vinyl back in 1974 and eventually got round to buying it in CD form - a superb album with a good mixture of songs and probably (apart from Bridge over....) some of the best vocals from the Garfunkel voice-box.
5,The best of the best of Art Garfunkel's voice,"My wife sends herself to sleep with this album. Recovering from an illness, this has been a calming, soothing rock to rest on. Just brilliant!"
4,Angel Clare Revisited,"I owned 'Angel Clare' on a record (large, round slab of vinyl with a hole in the centre)years ago and decided to revisit it.Much to my surprise, I am re-discovering and enjoying the folky harmonies of Art Garfunkel all over again."
3,Fair,"Art had a difficult time choosing quality songs for his great voice and this album is no exception. All I Know is the only great song here, but the rest are ok with a couple of clunkers. Traveling Boy suffers from a terrible arrangement (electric guitar ruins it) and is typical of most of Art's songs here which really don't have much of a melody - not sure why he chooses to sing such bland songs when there are so many really great songs out there. They really pale next to the material he got from Paul Simon. Jimmy Webb's songs are a case in point - nice lyrics and mostly no melody what so ever. Get ""Breakaway"" first, and then if you like that pick up Fate for Breakfast or a Best of collection -- ""Garfunkel"" or ""Simply the Best"" (Import) are the best choices available. His new collection ""The Singer"" has way way way too many poor selections and drags. Better yet get a Simon & Garfunkel album!"
5,Enchanting,"This is beautiful to listen to, and such a different selection from much else on the market. Garfunkel's voice is liquid silver, and he makes polished little works of art of each song. The sequence is satisfying too. While the plaintive, gentle songs are equally lovely (only for some reason I found ""Mary was an only child"" was a bit depressing) the highlight for me was his happy, jaunty and irrepressible ""I shall sing"", of Van Morrison's penning. It will be one of those songs one reaches for, with the toss of the head, to lift spirits when things are a bit grey."
5,Garfunkel and Angel Clare,"I still feel sad about the splitup of Simon and Garfunkel even after all these years. However, I enjoy the soothing, natural vocal sounds of Garfunkel. He's at his best with a folk song or a folk-like song. His expressive renderings are relaxing and pleasant."
5,Great Discovery,"I had never heard this album in its entireity, and I am so glad it was suggested to me. The review on Amazon is spot on, and the album still sounds very, very fresh. What a great voice, and with writers like Jimmy Webb, Paul Williams, Van Morrison, and Randy Newman--couple that with Art's voice--how do you go wrong? ""Traveling Boy"" is a favorite, along with the still popular, ""All I Know"". My wife and I listened to it in the car on a trip over Thanksgiving and it really brought us back. Even our teen daughter liked it. Imagine."
4,Fitness Dice Review,"I was pleased with the product and know that it will be well used in my physical education class. The only issue I had with this purchase was that only ONE pair of dice came to me in the mail and I was under the impression that I had purchased a PAIR, what I thought meant two sets of these fitness dice. Especially since the picture of the item showed two sets of dice. I assumed I was purchasing two sets. That was slightly confusing to me, but other than that I love what I got."
2,Worthless!,"Sony Premium Grade T-120 VHS Tapes used to be pretty darn good.These days that is not the case.The past few times that I have bought these tapes to record movies from the satellite dish,there have been to many flaws with the tape.One problem has been a line through the middle of the picture,like you sometimes have when you rent a movie thats about 20 years old,and also there have been jumping pictures,and small audio flaws as well.I use various brands of videotape,so I know that the problem lies here with the Sony videotape.Basically the record about as well as a tape you have recorded on over and over and over.They show too much wear way too soon.Get Maxell tapes instead."
3,Sony VHS tapes,"I bought three and they arrived quickly and were well packaged, but one was damaged, probably before it was even mailed. I don't think it would have happened in shipping. One of the tapes had a broken case. But it wasn't very noticble and after I put it in the machine and the red light began to blink, then I knew something must be wrong. After ejecting it, I saw the damage to the corner of the case. It looked like something had been dropped on it and it was badly cracked. The other two seems to be fine. They weren't alot of money or I'd be more upset than I am. It's never happened before and hopefully not again."
4,"colorful , well cast , literate","Streamed this fun and interesting seafaring adventure . Honestly , what's not to like ? James Mason was born to play smart , authoritative leaders . The predictable but erudite rich script and it's dialog provide James ample opportunity to do his thing . Well . If i had to select a leading man of the era (50's) who best exemplified the finest qualities of an Amarican , Alan Ladd would certainly make that short list . Although set in the 1780's/90's , his laconic , integrity exuding confidence has the SHANE appeal this film needs . You'll see some familiar faces and some good sets . Averaging 2 and 1/2 out of 4 stars from a couple of different synoptic film guides (including Leonard's) , you may find yourself being more forgiving of this 1953 semi-gem than the critics . After all , they've got their contemporaries looking over their shoulders and into their books . Quite good ancillary characters as well . Fun ."
2,A boring sea adventure.,"Based on a novel by the team of Nordhoff and Hall, this dreary film was an obvious attempt to duplicate the success of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, also based on a novel by the same duo. Since, like its predecessor, it involves a long sea voyage with a sadistic captain, it can't miss, right? Unfortunately, the resulting film is very dull and is only partly redeemed by good performances, but even James Mason cannot quite save it."
2,Sorry! I did not like it.,"First two stories were really boring. Well, I even skipped some pages. And some more complain. That book is too thick. It was very uncomfortable to read."
4,Loved it,It's wonderful to see how Lori Foster got her start as a writer. I must say she has not written one single thing that I haven't liked. That is of course those books that are not of the paranormal. Just a good series writer overall.
3,Not Lori Fosters best.,This was not Lori Foster's best but had some bright moments of writing. If you would like something better try her novel Too much Temptation
2,Another underwhelming re-release,"""Fallen Angels"" is a re-release of a collection of previously published stories. In a nutshell, they are three erotically charged short stories all dealing with private detectives and the misunderstood women they rescue, each with requisite wimpy heroines who let their alpha males walk all over them before finding their eventual happily ever after. Mostly, there are just long sexual passages with a little bit of a barely recognizable plot tossed in.They weren't great the first time, and certainly not worthy of a second press. I keep hoping that the Foster that beguiled me with ""Unexpected"" will capture my attention again. She came close with ""Havoc,"" but for the most part, it's been one disappointment after another, and no longer an auto-purchase author for me."
4,An Enlightening Read....,"Curie Nova provided me with a copy of her work and I really didn't know what to expect when I first heard the title. I thought it would be some type of religious undertaking. It was not. This work contained very realistic characters, dialogue, and situations. Her descriptions of her character(s) frustrations, experiences, and pains were so convincing to the point I wondered if this were truly a work of fiction. I was with her all the way until the end and then she lost me during the epiphany. I'll have to review that section again-however, I understood her message (one that I believe and support) and truly appreciate this body of work. Ms. Nova is a good author and storyteller I look forward to her next release."
5,a difference of opinion,"Although I'm not familiar with this album, I own ""A World of Piano"" by Phineas Newborn, on which ""Juicy Lucy"" appears. My desire to hear the original Silver track brought me here and I checked out the reviews to provide me a baseline guide. Unfortunately, I have little confidence in a reviewer who labels ""Juicy Lucy,"" a blues. Although steeped in blues vocabulary, like so much of the hard bop canon, the tune is in a 32 bar AABA format. And how did the other guy divine who Silver regarded as his competition? Anyway, I ordered the disk regardless. Maybe because I love Blue Mitchell's ballad playing. And I'll give it 5 stars even before the mail arrives."
1,Look at Something Else,You can't change cd's while playing one. After about a year mine started having mechanical problems.
4,Well worth the money.,"Well, I just read the other reviews and I can agree with some things, but not others. For example, I've had mine running for hours at a time and haven't had the slightest problem. Maybe that's just his. I think the sound is great and so are the features. The only problem I've had is that if there is even the slightest scratch on a disc, it sometimes has a hard time reading it. On the other hand, a disc can have a big scratch on it and it reads it just fine. Go figure. Anyway, now that the price has gone down on these cd-jukeboxes, I'll probably get Pioneer's 101 disc player to replace my 25, seeing as it's <...> less than the price I originally paid for the 25 a few years ago. In conclusion, this is a good player with a good price and I'm sure the amount of ""lemons"" are few."
1,Don't Buy Pioneer's CD-Changers,I would NOT recommend any of Pioneer's CD-changers... I have had TWO 25-CD changers in the last FIVE years. And both have stopped working on me within 22 to 30 months of purchase. My second one just died tonight. I bought it in June 1999.
4,Chivalry is not Dead...,"I enjoyed this book. As a teacher, I see the rampant need in our young men for some training in manners, etiquette, and chivalry. I read this book in search of some ideas to share with my own boys in trying to instill in them the importance of being a gentleman as opposed to the way the majority of boys seem to looking at life today. I found that this book contains some good information that should be shared with every young man.Minor does a good job in bringing our attention back to common decency. He likens the complete gentleman to the warrior in that he knows that there are things worth fighting for and he should be able to stand up and fight for what is right when the occasion calls for such action. I found that this book goes well will the martial philosophy that the modern day warrior lives by and is a book which those who aspire to live the warrior lifestyle would enjoy reading. 4 stars!Bohdi Sanders, author of Warrior Wisdom: Ageless Wisdom for the Modern Warrior"
2,Totally not what I was thinking.,"I thought this book was going to be a wonderful improvement on an 800 year old ideal, modernizing it to fit a less hostile and disgusting world. I was wrong. If you're against republicans and war, this book will infuriate you like it has done to me. Don't pick it up if your morals are not Christian conservative, do yourself a favor and find another mentor. I'd recommend anything by Gandhi or the Dalai Lama.I give this book two stars only because the author presents his viewpoint well enough to be useful to those that agree with him. The rest of us were at a loss picking up this book."
4,Histoire d'homme,"Miner's book is less an etiquette guide, as the title implies, than a history of the gentile concept. It's perfectly researched and aims to explain the circumstances under which our modern notions of gentility grew. The subject is divided into sections-- the knight, the gentleman, the warrior, the lover, the monk-each of which explain one aspect of manhood and responsibility in an effort to reclaim the virtues of each for a modern man wondering whether these concepts are entirely outdated, or worse, inherently misogynistic. Miner concludes that they are neither and ushers a call even toward a more respectable set of cultural codes under which men are men in every classic sense, even if it means coming to blows, either ideologically, or physically."
3,"History, Not ""How To""","We bought this book hoping for an instruction manual on teaching our boys how to be chivalrous in an age of decay. While it is an interesting read, it is not so much a ""guide"" as a plotting of time. A more appropriate title would be, ""The Compleat Gentleman: An Historical Discourse."" Great on detail and well-written, but we were misled by the title a bit."
3,A lesson in geneology.,"Reading this book was as interesting as reading the geneologies listed in the Bible. Every now and then a good nugget of information would appear, then back to the begatting. Being much more history than a guide, the recent grad will have dropped this book long before the necessity of its contents could be appreciated. I was looking for situational based advice and lessons from another voice and found this source lacking."
2,Draft Dodger,Brad Miner talks about fighting and chivelry of knights and of the military and then lets you know he is a draft dodger! Hypocracy should be the name of this book. He obviously does not live what he writes about.
2,Compleat Codswallop,"Pretentious language and marginally insightful axioms let this book down. The historical parts are somewhat interesting, but only seem to serve as the author's attempt to give credibility to his ideas on what it means to be a man. The result is a bizarre book full of drivel for gentleman-wannabes who would be better advised to find a different path to man-dom than this silly book..."
4,older version must be better,"My daughter has had one of these in her room since she was born and she's 6 now. We live in the city and outside noises used to wake the child up (dogs barking, loud cars, etc). Turn this machine on and it allows a peacful nights sleep. She will only sleep to the white noise. Daughter #2 came so we ordered her one and it sounds almost like the speaker is blown or something. Not nearly as good as the older one, even though they appear identical. The oldest model has now finally quit woring so we are looking for replacement. So far haven't founf anything as affordable as this one!"
1,You get what you pay for unfortunately,"I've been trying to replace my Radio Shack sleep machine, so I thought I'd give this a try. What a waste of money! I guess if you like the sounds of waves in a tin can, you might like it. I'm putting it in my daughter's garage sale."
1,Awful.,I bought this book because I have so enjoyed Mr. Carr's other books and had high hopes that this one would be as good. It's not. Not even close. I had to stop reading the introduction as it reads like some sort of angry scream that goes on far too long. Not to mention his glorification of Dick Cheney as a top military strategist. Seriously? I fought my way through the rest of the book but am still wondering why it's such a rag-tag disaster. The whole book is an angry mess. Please don't spend any money on it. Or if you have to have it you can buy my copy at a used book store.
4,Insightful,"Carr has written an insighful account of the political, economic, and human waste that is terrorism.Carr leads the reader through many historical examples, where occupying powers laid waste to the people they conquered only to receive in kind, many times over.Its a useful preliminary account of what terrorism is, and his advice to stop it is worth great consideration."
3,Is international terrorism war?,"Caleb Carr's book is informative and interesting. Of course, he tried to persuade the readers that international terrorism is indeed war and therefore should be answered by war. While he had successfully proven the case that war frequently included terrorism against civilians throughout history, he failed to prove the opposite: terrorism always means war.One example from the book. Carr did not agree with Clausewitz and he cited J.F.C. Fuller's criticism below against Clausewitz to support his view. According to Fuller, Clausewitz ""never grasped the true aim of war is peace and not victory."" If Fuller who Carr appeared to agree, was right, it is difficult to believe that bin Laden and other like minded terroists have peace and not victory as their true aim."
1,don't waste your money,"If you think the U.S. deserved the 911 attacks, this is the book for you. If you know anything about military history spend your money on something else. This book is PC anti western, anti Christian, and anti America rant."
4,"Excellent resource, but too opinionated.","This book is richly illustrated and puts the life and times of great scientists into historical perspective and context. It is an enjoyable read for anyone interested in learning about the major scientific figures of our history.However, the author seems to push, very subtley I might add, for Christianity. In one instance he says that the existence of God has been proven (150). On numerous pages he makes errant claims, such as the one that Christianity has been science-friendly thoughout history (163). It seems that the author has some conflict between his faith and his science and takes it out on his readers. I don't think this is wrong, but it would be better left out of encyclopedic material.Don't let that turn you off: the pro-religious propaganda is in very small amounts. Aside from that, this book is superb and should make a welcome addition to your bookshelf!"
5,All my frued bits work well. This one no exception,I've made cove moldings all over the house with this. It's still going strong with no signs of letting up. I'm very pleased with it's performance.
2,Barely a Smolder,"Great topic; pleasant writing style. Relevant selection of key ""thinkers"". Didn't induce much activity in my grey matter; no flames, no sparks. Can't figure out why...(unless it's because I've already read so much about this topic that nothing new was added to my thoughts). Anyone need a barely used book?"
2,Not For Amateur Readers!,"I'm a logical person, and I was looking for insight in to the gray area between science and religion. I struggled to continue through the book to see if it would get better. I think I'm the wrong personality type for this kind of book."
4,"Great concepts, well explained, where's my dictionary?","Fire in the Mind was extremely satisfying in its treatment of some very complex topics and provided an excellent overview of all the big issues of science today. Johnson ties in a lot of disciplines and draws some very interesting parallels between the work of some very diverse groups. It was also a great vocabulary expander. Apparently, there's a bigger market for big words in the book business than in the pages of the Times."
5,"""In the spirit of 'Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance'""","""In the spirit of 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.' . . . Compression is the essence of science [and] Johnson proceeds to compress with utter clarity, almost casually tap-dancing his way through particle physics, quantum theory, cosmology and evolutionary biology. . . . 'Fire in the Mind' is a connoisseur's gazeteer. . . . Vibrant and exhilarating and even inspirational . . . a god's-eye view of the terrain. Imagine that this book could have been sent back a hundred years, to the time of Darwin and of James Clerk Maxwell mulling over electromagnetism and entropy. What is the corresponding book from a hundred years ahead which might turn our present perspectives inside out?"" -- from the review by Ian Watson in New Scientist."
3,Somewhat entertaining for toddlers,"I found that this package with 5 sets of the disney princesses is a very good buy for your money's worth because, if you decide to buy the sets individually, it is more expensive. Now, the sets are not durable because they can easily be bended. Therefore, you need to pay close attention when your child is using the viewmaster as to prevent damage to the reels. The 3D images look very good. However, I found that my daughter was not as interested in this toy as I thought that she was going to be. I guess in the present modern world children (even toddlers) are more interested in electronic devices."
1,"BEWARE, description misleading!!!","Description says you can string up to six of these together, but upon connecting the fourth one there was a quick flash and then NOTHING. All four were ruined! Called support and was told the replacement fuse kits are $16,500,000 each!!! Guess I should have researched this better before buying. Now I'm stuck with $840M of worthless junk. WHERE'S MY BAILOUT PLAN! CONGRESS ARE YOU LISTENING!!!"
3,what burns me,Is that they expect you to blow a couple hundred mil - and then pay $7.72 for shipping!
5,Another Great Book,"Every child should have this book read to them.Then they should GO OUTSIDE and PLAY!I believe that this book will bring back a memory or 2 in any one who reads it.All of these books {From Reiman Publications}are ""Reader Written."" Bettina Miller is the wonderful, hard working lady that compiled the many stories sent in to make this book.It is a book that will surely be a conversation starter at family get togethers."
4,nice,"I really enjoyed this book. A nice description of the car, and its development---as a project, not just as a vehicle."
3,Caz - Thunderdome Review,"I give it a 3/5 cause it's a sweet album, but....there are to many guest appearences. I think Caz should do more songs by himself and less with other people. My personal favorite songs were ""Chedda"" with Krayzie Bone & ""U A Thug"" with Layzie Bone & Ice T."
5,Great look at Canada's top counter terrorist team,"This is an excellent read on Joint Task Force 2, Canada's version of Delta Force and the SAS. Lots of details on the history and missions of the team (Bosnia, Haiti, Nepal, Kosovo, Central Africa, Rwanda), info on weapons, aircraft etc. There is also a wide range of photos showing JTF2 guys doing their thing. I appreciated the extensive list of sources at the back of the book where the author lists that his information comes from. Most, if not all, are from official Canadian Forces documents and interviews (JTF2's unit history,etc) so it boasts the credibility and accuracy of the book. The one drawback, I found was that some of the photos are grainy, being taken from the official JTF2 training video but I can easily overlook that when compared with all the information that is presented."
5,insightful,"Wow, facinating book. A real eyeopener. A must read even if you're not a military buff. Well researched and easy to read."
1,The CD does not work! :(,"When I purchased the book and wanted try to use the CD, the CD was not work whenever I insert again and again!"
3,YOU MUST BUY THE AUDIO-CASSETTES,The book is very well-organized and offers a lot of practice. It is probably one of the best textbooks for TOEFL preparation.It could have been rated 5-STARS but I rated it only 3-STARS because it should be clearly said that the AUDIO-CASSETTES are fundamental for the listening preparation and that the CD-ROM doesn't contain the same listening material. I bought the CD-ROM package and I have not audio material for the paper-based test.
2,ESL sts please note: Important details left off this page,"Two reader reviews state the cassettes came with the book. My wife bought the Book/CD edition thinking she was buying a complete study package, where the only difference between the CD and cassette versions was the format of the audio. Surprise. What the web page does not state is the cassettes contain the audio necessary for the listening section of this book. The cassettes are sold seperately from the Book/CD package. The CD is for the CBT."
3,"The portable DVD player is an attractive, pricey product.","I feel that the portable DVD player is a convenient item to have around. Whether you're traveling, or out having fun, it is always handy. Though it is convenient, there are still downsides to this product. One of them is that you cannot watch television broadcasts. This feature would make it a very worthwhile product to purchase. Another downside is that it is a ""little bit"" overpriced. Until this product receives competition with other companies such as Sony or Philips, you won't be seeing this product in many households across the US and other countries. Portable computers already have an optional DVD feature. With this feature added to the software and hardware already on the computer makes the computer more valuable, and it costs little more than the portable DVD player alone. Overall, this product was a good idea, but, as stated before, it costs more than many people are willing to pay."
5,A LIFE-CHANGING PRODUCT...,"...just kidding, wanted a catchy title. =D but this is seriously one cool dvd player. its small, its light, the picture is great- this little guy meets & exceeds expectations of a portable dvd player."
2,Not quite ready for prime time,"I compared this unit side-by-side with my Compaq laptop DVD. The computer is better, period. Of course, both suffer from the limitations of the display, which cannot match the resolution of the TV set. And neither can match the performance of a home DVD player (when the L50 is used portably). Digital artifacts are apparent on both computer and L50. At $1,000, the Panasonic is an overpriced novelty. If money is no concern and you don't want to lug a laptop, buy it. But the screen is too small for true enjoyment and the colors are not very close to the original. If you get one, do a simultaneous display on your TV and see what you're missing."
1,Buy a notebook computer and save the money,"This product is soon to join the dinosaurs, eight track tape machines and betas. Why buy one of these when you can get the same in a computer with a dvd drive?"
4,WOW! The best gadget out there!,"The price of the this little gadget may turn you off, but I've only had it for about a day and it is amazing! I can play DVDs and CDs (cuz my minidisc player broke and it's gonna take about 6 weeks to get it back :[ ) on the go now! My bus trip to school is quite long (about an hour back and forth) and I get quite bored, so this will occupy my time. It's flexible in its uses too, like I said, playing CDs and DVDs, and u can hook it up to your TV. The display is shocking, too...my mom despises HDTV for it's price ($7,000-10,000? ), so the widescreen presentation is terrific...especially DVDs enhanced for widescreen TVs. The remote is cool, especialy cuz the select thing on the unit is far too small, and the remote fits in my wallet like a credit card. I recommend getting top of the This is one Christmas present I won't soon forget, and will impress people at school...thanx, Mom and Dad!"
2,"Portable, but too small",This is a gimmick item. The picture is just too small to enjoy watching for any length of time. I sent it back.
5,Perfect...,"I absolutely LOVE this product. The picture and sound are both great. The unit comes with enough cables to get you hooked into a TV. It even has on optical out, so you HI-FI buffs will enjoy pure digital...I travel quite a bit and this thing has been great for occupying my time...As far as not using it on an airplane- I disagree. I beleive the line goes- ""Portable electronic devices may now be used with the expection of cellular phones and pagers..."" Most all laptops have cd-roms and they have not been the cause of any plane crashes to date.In summary- if you travel a lot get it, but shop around for the best deal."
5,Best Little Gadget Out There,I purchased this unit just after Christmas. I LOVE IT! We have watched a bunch of movies while travelling and while not as great sounding as my dvd and bose system at home it is wonderful.The only thing I have to ask is where can I get a cigarette lighter adapter for this little guy?Buy one they're worth the money.
3,not that great,for a little bit more money you could buy a laptop computer with a dvd player in it with a bigger screen and all the same stuff. this is a cool little dvd player though if you just want the dvd.......
5,This is a great product,I just got my dvd player and i love i take it almost everywhere with me. they did a great job building this product and i am so happy to have one.
1,What is Amazon thinking?,"I did my research and decided to order this DVD player-which is not sold directly through Amazon but an external site. When I went to order I clicked onto the link and placed my order-I did NOT recieve a DVD player but a PLUG for the DVD player. Upon re-checking my order I saw that-that was exactly where the external site took me-to a place where I could order the plug, infact, that is all they sell. Ok my fault for not really checking this, but I trusted Amazon to link to what they were advertising!!! ARG."
1,It costs $700 for the novelty of portability?!?,"The panasonic home unit is $299 on this site and the portable dvd is $999 -- so you are saying that something in this little bitty unit is worth $700 more than the home unit?!? It seems that the novelty of portability cost 3 times that of a home unit --- IT SHOULDNT! Shoppers beware -- this pricing schema is still in its novelty phase in its growth cycle. Most people are being caught up on impulse shopping in regards to this product (i know i had my credit card pulled out until i read the users comments). It seems to be a great product (i would buy it for no more than $450) but if you are spending a 'grip' -- you should go with a computer. At least then youll get more bang for your buck.According to the buyers here, there seems to be too many problems with this unit right now -- main one being overheating, low battery life, and depixelization after long period of use.Thank goodness for these reviewsThanks Amazon"
5,"Great for travel, your laptop is to big on a plane!!!","I also workout with this unit on a stairmaster at the gym. Try that with a laptop... Have the laptop for business, and still carry th portable DVD due to it's smaller footprint!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!,"This Panasonic DVD player only has two weaknesses. And only ofthem is a problem. The weaknesses are 1) The price-If you have themoney You will not regret it. 2) gets warm. <--Not really a problem. Sound is nice, especially through the headphones. The screen is so nice you will forget that it's small it will seem huge, if you are watching an interesting movie. I would recommend it to anyone. Thanks Panasonic--Great product, the Best Toy on the market regarding DVD's today."
5,I am MR PORTABLE,"having everything portable and living out of my car VERY often due to business, I suggest this product to everyone. Sure it gets hot, so put it down.The size is minimal, the quality is HUGE, the cost is high, but if you are into toys, this is the one. I can pack my whole trip-life into one small metal carryall. (Sony Watchman (colorTV and AM/FM), Gameboy, Laptop, mini tape recorder, letherman, GPS, camera, Palm pilot, and NOW the L50D) If you are a businessman who travels and gets bored, this is a lifesaver.Trust me, an entire techie life is now portable thanks to the L50D. GET ONE!"
4,Good product but few flaws...,"I recently purchased this product and i was so excited to use it but the picture quality is not nearly as good as you would see on a regular tv. It's kind of ""fuzzy"", it's pretty good for a portable but don't expect it to be super clear. Be careful of the base of the player, it can get pretty hot after 30 mins or so. But overall a great product!"
5,IT RULES!,"Hi, I've been enjoying reading the reviews and have a few things to say. After having the L-50 for a few months all I can say is that I LOVE IT. The image resolution is awesome, It is much lighter and less bulky then the previous version (the L-10) The battery lasts for a solid 3 hours, long enough for anyone to get through most movies. And although it heats up a bit, why are people complaining about that. It is not like the Palm Theatre is hot enough to burn you! In the few months I've had it, I LOVE it, it is definitely worth spending the money. And best of all, it hooks up perfectly with my home theatre system, something that a laptop does not!"
1,A poor photo copy of a good book,"I was amazed when after purchasing this book from what I thought was a reputable source, Amazon, I received a rather grainy, nearly unreadable PHOTOCOPY of the book in a binding. The book's 5""x 7"" pages were photocopied onto 8.5"" x 11"" paper, without zoom, partially skewed and with many drop outs in the text, then bound and passed off as a ""paperback"". Beware; you are not getting what's in the picture when you order this item."
5,Very good book,"I have read this old but still worthy book after reading ""Flatland"" which is a perfect compliment. One word: KEWL."
5,Long Live The CRUE,"First of all, thank you all for your reviews. I'd just like to add that I am French and I hadn't the opportunity to see Motley on tour this year. I saw them twice, in 86 and 89, respectively for the Theatre of Pain and the Dr. Feelgood tour, and, knowing what I, and you, reviewers and fans talk about, I know it will be one of the best RNR dvds if not the best. I just can't wait to have it! And, please believe a true RNR fan: Buy it, you can't and you won't be disappointed! Long Live The Crüe!"
2,I agree with skymac2's review,I agree 110% with Skymack2's review on this Motley Crew DVD. He put every aspect into perfect perspective. It sucks! Shame on these guys for taking our money. The Band should have watched it themselves first. I have a very high end AV system and this DVD sounds horrible.
5,Satisfied Customer!!!,"I was very satisfied with my purchase. My product was her on a timely matter. I would recommend using amazon.com over most internet sites. They give you a cheaper rate & free shipping costs. Product is always on a timely matter. Thank you Amazon.Com for being a life safer & great quality service.Sincerly,Donald SengerDevils Lake, ND"
2,"grainy poorly lit video, muddled audio","Very dissapointing. Sound is very garbled, no highs or lows, just muddled. Not sure if the audio is bad or the band just cant play, or both. The video is not lit at all. Hard to make out which guys are which. Some funny moments, like the camcorder routine, but over all hard to watch, impossible to hear."
4,Motley Crue: Carnival of Sins [Blu-ray],"Muy buen recital, la imagen es espectacular, lo único que le cambiaría es el hecho que es muchos de las imágenes usan un color de luz que interfiere un poco con la calidad."
2,Quality of Blu Ray Video Lackluster!,"I will keep this short. I had viewed this using a PS3 with HDMI straight into a 70"" Mitsubishi Diamond Series 1080p DLP. Show is classic Motley Crue! Sound Quality was really good. However, the video quality isn't. There are times when it looks really good but then there are a lot of times that the color saturation is way off and the pixelation is terrible. No consistency in the image! Very annoying while watching. It is time for all companies producing blu ray video to get their collective stuff together and consistently produce high quality audio & video entertainment! I wonder if the DVD version is better?"
5,What a great DvD,This is even better than the show i saw in February of 2005. This is the Greatest Live DVD i have ever saw. I love the second Disc it is full of extra stuff. Three Videos and much more. If you are a Crue head get it its well worth the money.
5,Crue is Back!!! Not for the weak at heart.,"I had the liberty to see Motley Crue 4 times on this tour. Two of those 4 were ""Meet and Greet,"" what I learned at the Meet & Greet is that the Crue are not doing this to make tons of cash (thats just an added bonus) they are doing this tour for US, the FANS. This DVD is for us the FANS, this DVD much like the show is over the top, it allows the viewer to see many things one could not see at the show. This DVD also includes bonus featurs such as The documentary ""Inside the Big top"" which is about 30 minutes of backstage touring with none other than MIGHTY MIKE he does a great job of sharing the day to day activites with the viewer. THIS DVD IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT. This is not you're ordinary DVD, THIS IS A MOTLEY DVD. So stop reading already and buy the DVD it is well worth the cash!!!"
1,Poor bluray,"I'm rating this as a bluray disc only. The concert itself is amazing. The Bluray disc edition is a waste of money.The picture quality is no better than the DVD and same with the audio.Bluray is suppose to be high definition video and sound. And we are treated to neither here. Very disappointed with the Dolby Digial Audio. Where is the TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio in 7.1 audio?!?!If you have the DVD already, than pass on this bluray mess."
5,I felt like I was back in High School,I felt like grabbing a mullet wig and flicking the lighter. This was a blast. It was good un clean fun and more DVD's need to be like this. The drum solo was terrible and that's what made it great. Only a metal head will get that last line! ROCK ON MOTLEY!
4,Classic Motley Crue - debauchery and all,"Blu-ray version is pretty decent. Video degradation effects are probably intended for whatever reason. Awesome song set that really rocks the house!The only thing that was somewhat annoying was some fool (who managed to be close enough to a pickup mic) was whistling the same high pitched warble throughout much of the later songs. He was just loud enough and repetitive enough to be distracting.Other than that minor annoyance, very awesome concert that made you ""Wish you were there!""."
4,DEFINITELY DESERVED MORE ATTENTION,"A GANG OF BLACK DRUG RUNNERS FEUD WITH A GANG OF LATINO DRUG RUNNERS IN THE SOUTH BRONX. THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY SHOULD'VE GOTTEN MUCH MORE ATTENTION WHEN IT WAS RELEASED 13 YEARS AGO. EVERYONE DID A GOOD JOB IN THIS MOVIE, ESPECIALLY THE MAN WHO PLAYED THE LEADER OF THE LATINOS [WHO'S BILLED ONLY AS JOSEPH]. SCREW ''EMPIRE'', YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE! THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED GANGSTA MOVIES EVER MADE."
4,"Great Plot, But...","...the lousy actors ruined it. Don't get me wrong; I liked this movie. I first saw it on HBO back in 1994, and I LOVED it! I agree with the other poster who stated that this movie should have gotten more attention. Unfortunately, this one slipped through the cracks. Great plot, great twists, but TERRIBLE actors. Girl who played, 'Rachel,' was terrible in the scene where one of Ceasars boys comes into the restaurant shooting. Her screams were far too fake, and her facial expressions were worse! Even the black guy who played Ceasar was somewhat of a bad actor. If you can get past the non-acting actors...you'll love this movie! It's a clasic!"
4,Touching Evil 4stars,"I loved this show. The only reason I forgive USA for cancelling this series is that they green-lighted Burn Notice 4 years ago....When most shows are scared of story arcs that make it hard to shuffle episodes like cards for sweeps, Touching Evil had deep writing...I long for this to go to DVD!"
5,RELEASE THE DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This show is amazing and the main characters have similaraties to mulder and scully from the X-Files!!!!!!!!!!!!!Release it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Superficial,"The description of the book has more meat than the book itself. This disappointing book is a 15 short chapter breeze through a multitude of subjects, and does not linger long on any single subject. There are some nice diagrams and ten thousand foot views crammed into 374 total pages (the page count vs. chapter count alone should indicate how superficial this book is). An example is the 21 pages devoted to weighty subjects encompassing project management tasks, configuration management, verification and validation, quality assurance, decisions and risks. Any one of the topics would have merited at least 20 page in a serious book on systems engineering. Useful to sales and marketing types who are selling systems engineering services, and executive management who might like a quick overview of systems engineering. This book is useless for technical professionals."
5,Essential with Quicken POS ZEBRA LP2824,"Great little machine! Cant believe we used Quickbooks POS for 4 years before getting it. Was a little hard to get the drivers correct with Windows 7.0, but now we have no need for a price gun any loger. This machine ties the computer info to the merchandise perfectly, prints the bar code with no problem. We are still trying to get our logo onto the label. Love it, well worth the investment."
5,MyShelf.com Book Review,"Have you ever picked up a book and felt it was written especially with you in mind? This is the exact feeling I experienced in reading Mary D. Esselman and Elizabeth Ash Velez's Kiss Off: Poems to Set You Free. These ladies masterfully crafted a small book into a mini doctor's manual where I was able to look up whatailed me: broken heart, messed-up family, elusive career- and receive perfect poems to treat my pain.By reading this book, I rediscovered my true self and true direction. The strength and inspiration of this book captures the true essence of life. I feel this book is the stepping-stone a person needs to reach the top of their world. Once you read it, you will find that you keep it close at hand to refer to often when you need a shot of happiness and strength. This book will guide you through those difficult times when life decides to throw you a curve."
4,a recently unearthed gem from the early `70s...,"This album is a recently unearthed gem from the early `70s that got snagged up in some major record label red tape (ala Peter Wolf), and never saw the light of day. This blind soul rocker's sound shifts between Lenny Kravitz, Jimi Hendrix and Marvin Gaye. Jerry Garcia and Merle Saunders play pedal steel and keyboards giving two tracks a real Grateful Dead sound. Also, the Persuasions do harmonies on another track. And a real surprise to me is the original version of Jet Airliner is on here. I always thought that was a Steve Miller song, but Pena's keyboardist and producer was Ben Sidran who was also in Miller's band. So at least Pena has been able to eat all these years. Pena is a local guy from Cape Cod and today he is very ill. A tragic story about what could have been a hit album and successful career if Capitol Records knew what the hell they doing 30 years ago."
5,A rare treasure!,"Since the movie ""Genghis Blues"" won an Academy Award nomination, Paul Pena's name has become familiar to a lot of people. But what many don't know is that Paul's extraordinary talents as a musician and songwriter have been recognized and honored by other musicians for many years; he's one of those rare guitarists who can play anything from classical flamenco to gut bucket blues, and his vocal range is just as impressive. This album, recorded but not released in 1973, showcases some of his many original songs, including the original version of ""Jet Airliner"". Even if you listen only to this one and ""Cosmic Mirror"", you'll get more than your money's worth with this CD!"
5,What a find !,This CD is outstanding. Take the time and listen to a couple of samples and then press BUY !!
3,Paul Pena CD Review,"I read about this Album and artist in the Rolling Stone magazine. He had played with some of the groups that I like and I thought it might be interesting to see what he had done on his own. It's a good CD, but it wasn't really what I had expected. I listen to it occasionally as a break from the regular CD's I play more regu- larly. It was kind of a nice addition to my collection."
2,New Train just OK,"A friend highly recommended this. I thought it was OK, but I don't think there was the tuvan throat singing, that was the basis of the recommendation. Maybe I've have been better off with the DVD documentary."
4,Nice price and service,I have ordered twice--both small orders--and the company has responded as if they were large pieces of business. Surprisingly fast service and best price on the web.
3,Weather strip,"I'm giving this 3 stars only because it is not what I'd expected, not nearly dense enough for my purpose needed. It may be marvelous for use as intended. But I needed it to fill in mega gaps where our dog destroyed the exterior door's factory weather stripping."
1,I got this with my pet door,"It didn't stick well and fell off almost immediately. So I ordered more from Amazon, washed the area where it would stick, again, left it overnight to dry, and tried again. Same thing. Not good for sealing the gap left when using my slider with the doggie door.If you have the same problem, I purchased, after much trial and error, a garage door weather seal. It nailed on the end, rather than used a glue strip. It was much thicker, flexible and durable. IT solved my problem. This weather stripping was junk."
3,Relatively weak adhesion,"I bought this to cover the gap between panels in a garage door when it is in the down position. The weather strip covered the gaps fine, but I found the adhesive coating weak enough that by the time the door had been opened and closed several times, the tape was falling off. I ended up having to put duct tape on top of the tape (not the seal) portion of this weatherstripping to get it stay on my admittedly old and somewhat weathered garage door interior. So I'd rate this 'average'-- good for sealing gaps and probably adequate at sticking on freshly painted smooth surfaces or in static situations, but definitely in need of extra adhesion in situations where the covered surfaces move or are not in pristine condition."
2,ok but...,It keeps the air out when it sticks...but the strips continuely peel back. So I would look for something stickier
2,Won't stick at 54 degrees,"I put this on our new storm door yesterday. It was easy enough to do but, this morning when I opened the door it was hanging down. Maybe I should have waited until it was colder."
2,I'd like it if it had a strong enough adhesive.,"I'm not the carpenter my husband was or I wouldn't have ordered this V-seal. He'd have replaced the old metal weatherstripping with new metal weatherstripping because it works best.This would work if I could actually get it to stick. It wouldn't work as well because it is really too narrow but it does have considerable spring.I know I won't be buying it again because after the first window which needed a new seal, I gave up on it.Yes, I cleaned with alcohol, sanded the rough spots or whatever, but it just wouldn't stick.Perhaps it would be better to install it on a hot summer day but that would make it difficult to tell if it were actually working.I tried installing it on a cool but not cold day and ... although the test closure showed that there wasn't much cold air infiltration, on the next open/close it simply buckled from lack of adhesive.I'm not sure why I gave it 2 stars, perhaps 1 star is sufficient."
5,otis rush any place im going,all 11 trakks are great on this cd. the sound is so good that i cannot stop playing it.i only buy good sounding recording.i am planing to buy more of his cds.dj dave canada.
1,Lies! Does not give 40 feet!!!!,"The is the 2nd time that I have purchase this roll of canvas for my prints from Ace Photo here on Amazon. The quality of the canvas is amazing. Prints beautifully. BUT... I only got 20 feet on this roll and last time it was 19. So the ad is incorrect! You only get 20 feet not 40. Now when I get it from ACE photo the roll is taped in a box from the manufacture, so, I think it is the manufacture that is cheating the consumers. Beware of purchasing this product! I am giving it a one star... not because of the quality, the quality is five stars... but of the quantity."
5,love it!!!,"I Love, Love, Love this video. I had a baby a year ago and am still trying to get back into shape. I love this video because it is challenging, but not overwhelming. It's a wonderful combination of pilates and gentle stretching. I love to do it after I get off of the elliptical. It is a great way to cool down. It's 50 min so it seems a little daunting at first but it goes by so quickly. I always feel long and lean after doing it. I am definitely seeing a difference in my posture. I also love this video because Karen does not have one of those overly sugary, sappy voices that you usually find in these kinds of videos. She is gentle and soft spoken without being cheasy. Hope this helps!"
3,Not enough focus on the back,"This is for the core, abs & back. There was only about 15 minutes set aside for the back on this 45 minute video."
5,Calico Critter Village House,Great product. Keeps children fascinated and busy and encourages their creativity. Easy to play alone or with friends. Highly recommended for families with young ones who are curious and interested in replicating care-taking activities.
5,Excellent Choice Instead of a Dollhouse!,"I wasn't sure whether or not this toy would be a good substition for a traditional ""dollhouse"" but am glad Santa chose it for my little girl. She is nearly 7 and has spent HOURS playing with it! The pieces are small, but that isn't a problem as she enjoys setting the house up just so. Little kids have little fingers... so it's okay. Also, her Littlest Pet Shop toys have found a new home so she can use this house for her other small toys too! The only drawback about this toy is that you have to purchase items separately. Being that my daughter's birthday is in January... I just found myself getting sucked into buying the Kitchen, Living Room, Bathroom, and Master Bedroom... so it does add up $$$$. It's worth it though. Defintely NOT recommended for children who still put toys in their mouths."
4,Great little house,"We bought this for my 3-yr old she always plays with it at the store, she still plays a little each day. We also bought the table that goes with works great for her height."
5,A perfect toy for boys too.,"I bought this dollhouse for my grandson some time ago. I was just playing with it with him yesterday. He has continued to play with it all the months he has had it. If you read my reviews, you know that I loathe battery, talking toys overall. This house allows him to make up any number of scenarios. I got him some of the little animal sets with it. And he loves those. The fact they are animals and not people has led him to call it an ark. He would play with it anyway, but he likes the ""boy"" connotation of animals. (He gets the boy thing from friends, not from me. And sigh, je is only three.)Sometimes he uses little plastic zoo animals to set up a zoo. The house just lends itself to any number of permutations, and I love sitting there and playing all the worlds he thinks up. Great gift."
4,"Expensive, but by far the best doll house on the market","We bought the Deluxe Village House, the mouse family, and a couple sets of furniture for my 3 year-old for Christmas. Was awfully pricy, but by far one of the coolest play/doll houses on the market. The furniture sets come with lots of small pieces, so be warned. All the little pieces and the cool details like small drawers that pull out are what make it so cool. We've had it for almost a year and nothing is broken, but I'm sure a couple of the small pieces have been lost. The furniture seems almost too big for the house though. Wish the house was slighly bigger. Our daughter still enjoys playing with it, and we'll probably add on to it this Christmas."
5,In love with it,My daughter loves calico critters and collecting the houses to make a village. Came packaged well not hard to put together at all.
2,TV PILOT ALERT,"THE PRESENCE is a 1992 tv-pilot for NBC that never sold; watching it you can see why. A typically stereotypical group of survivors end up on a deserted (not really, though) island which once housed a facility where genetic breeding was conducted. In the mishmash of the plot, one never knows what really happened, and by its ""open ending"", you can see how it would have been a series. The cast is wasted, with only flashes of talent from Gary Graham and Joe Lara. Otherwise, its effects are mundane and its suspense level virtually non-existent."
3,Seemed better when I watched it on tv long ago...,As I said it seemed better when I watched it on tv long ago.Still not a bad TV movie.
5,Top Quality Help for the Swift and the Slow,"The VTC Training CD by Michael Hurwicz for Swift 3D is terrific. The information is systematically and carefully presented. Hurwicz moves at a good pace, clearly showing and explaining each action he takes. The interface fills the screen as we are guided through each of the components. Some video instruction can be very muddled but this is a superior product in several ways, including good audio quality. This can be a terrific alternative for visual learners, or an addition to reading manuals (I have found few books that even address this program). I found it really helps to have the Swift 3D program open-- hit pause on the instruction-- and actually practice each step as or after you see it; it makes actual skill training (not just the theory half) surprisingly easy. I am very satisfied with this purchase and gladly recommend it.Be Well,dr ron"
4,Truly Unique Pop-Up Book,"RUGBY scores a ""try"" with its first pop-up, expressive illustrations and brief but simple to understand history of the game, its players, rules and awards. While the game rugby isn't for everyone, the book RUGBY appeals to even those of us who are not jocks!"
3,"Can be challenging, but not strenuous","It's true, this is one workout, not two. There are, however, two instructors to follow, making it both beginner and ""intermediate"" level. The music is not auditorialy exciting, and the set is not visually exciting, but the workout can be tailored to be challenging, but not strenuous. I give it a rating of average."
1,Bad quality DVD,"Bad quality DVD. No sound. Cannot use it. The content is not ""exiting"" Do not buy this DVD and do not buy anything from this seller. The seller did not respond to my request either."
2,Encyclopedia Britannica 32 Volume set,"I ordered the set, costing over $100. When my shipment arrived, it was one book. When I contacter the company, they told me they do not sell full sets, that the ad was worded wrong. They told me to keep the book and gave me a full refund."
1,Incompatiable with Windows Vista,"When I tried to run this software on my Windows Vista System, it could not read the disc. Therefore, I cannot rate the product itself. I will try running this on my older laptop."
5,"MUY BIEN, APARTMENT ZERO","Being over 70 I have a reputation for living behind the curve, but how did I miss this emotionally strung in-your-face cinematic landmine from all the way back to 21 years ago?! Viewing APARTMENT ZERO for the very first time on October 04,2009 nailed me to my chair and diabolically coated it with super glue (as an added immobility guarantee). I wasn't goin' NOWHERE 'til this British flick (filmed in Argentina) was over .... even then, personal choice was limited by the pervasive slack-jawed wonderment at what I had just witnessed. The cast is superlative and serendipitous; imagine my surprise when the late British actress Liz Smith (Vicar of Dibley) appeared on the screen! APARTMENT ZERO just blew me away (I guess you can tell). Definitely not for children or those easily upset by bizarre cerebral human and political misery being brought to the forefront for indelicate exposure."
5,Excellent Movie,"I recently watched this movie three times in a row. The acting by Colin Firth and Hart Bochner is first rate. Jack is very likeable and lures people of both sexes. The sexual chemistry between Adrian and Jack is very evident. Adrian is one of several people that Jack seduces and he just has to look at you with his beautiful blue eyes to make you want to do whatever he wants. It is a very interesting look at human nature and it shows us that you can't always judge a book by its cover. People are not always what they appear to be. The ending of the movie was very intense and somewhat surprising. Once again, you can't judge a book by its cover. I highly recommend this movie."
4,"Atmospheric, haunting, compelling","Hollywood could never pull off a movie this hard to define. Set in Buenos Aires, it stars British Colin Firth, whom everyone is seeing stars over due to the new Bridget Jones film, and American Hart Bochner, the definition of attractive leading man if there ever was one. We need more movies with Hart Bochner's face filling the screen! When he rescues the cat on the ledge, it is movie-making magic. Bochner is a mysterious character who shows up and is taken in by Firth. While the film's ending is quite unexpected and, frankly, a little on the weird side, the flow of this film is gorgeous, careening between humanistic character study and slightly gory crime scenes. At its core, it's about a male friendship between two men who are unstable in different ways -- fascinating to watch. Why more people haven't seen this movie, I have no idea ...."
1,This has to be one of the worst movies ever created.,"Junk, pure junk. That pretty much says it all. This movie is so slow it's ridiculous. There is no payoff at all at the end. STAY CLEAR OF THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!"
4,A sure-fire cure for acute movie fanaticism!,"Do you ever feel like you're obsessing about movies just a bit much? Are you TOO good at playing the ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" game? Do you participate in every daily movie poll at [...] and take every quiz at Flixster? Have you watched ""Pulp Fiction"" a hundred times in search of some unifying theme? Or ... do you know somebody else who exhibits these symptoms?If so, it's time for you (or them) to check THIS movie out. ""The movie for people who watch too many movies,"" as I like to call it. As a movie fanatic who's seriously losing touch with the real world, Colin Firth's character makes a superb negative role model. Viewing this film can ONLY be a sobering wakeup call for someone too enamored of cinema. It definitely helped me to put the brakes on my excessive moviewatching and limit myself to superior fare."
3,Fun,"Some of these episodes have better transfers, others worse. And some of them have a decidedly more ""Christmasy"" feel to them. The Annie Oakley episode in particular wasn't one that you'd really sit down on Christmas Eve to watch, and the Robin Hood one had little if anything to do with the holiday at all. But the ""Date With an Angels"" episode--starring a youthful Betty White--might make the purchase worthwhile by itself (though it does appear on a better DVD collection offered by Amazon,Christmas TV Classics, Vol. 2. Despite the poor transfer, the Burns and Allen ep also is a solid offering.I've been buying up old TV episodes on DVD for several years ago, and if you enjoy that sort of thing as I do, go ahead and buy this. You won't be sorry because it's inexpensive."
3,Vintage TV isn't as good as we remember...,"I'm a fan of clean, family-friendly movies and television. Naturally, I assumed my family would enjoy these vintage TV shows with Christmas themes. Frankly, some of them were just plain awful in terms of writing and acting. On the first disc (red case) I only watched two shows all the way through (Date with the Angels because I wanted to see a young Betty White and Burns and Allen because their comedy holds up even today.) The rest I skipped through. Two months later I plucked up enough courage to watch the second disc (green case) and was pleasantly surprised with most of it. The ""Four Star Playhouse"" was outstanding. Of the remaining shows The Scarlet Pimpernel was particularly painful. Meet Corliss Archer and Sherlock Holmes were okay."
4,UNDERATED,"This is truly truly a wonderful album and dizzy dust and andy bring some great lyrics while einstein drops some funky beats in the vein of a Tribe Called Quest. When I first heard this joint I wasnt feeling it that much the production is a little different from Taste The Secret but it started to grow on me after a while and im sure it will grow on you to. If you are tired of rappers always talking about rims, hoes, guns, and money and long for that golden age of Hip Hop when it was all about showin your skills on the mic and just havin fun with the music than this may be your new favorite group."
5,keeping it fresh ud is on point.,"For everyone who hasn't heard of ugly duckling you need to get this. The record is just as good as their first ""Fresh Mode"" and easy to listen to. young einstien blends the beats and cuts in so well that you can sit down and listen to the whole album with out skipping songs. They don't cuss at all but manage to rip up the mic. you got to pick this album up."
5,Journey to anywhere is fantastic!!!!,"This is the best album I have ever bought. Amazing beats and hooks, the best rhymes. They're clean and just having fun. This CD is the best example of what hip-hop should be. I loved this CD from the start to finish. If you enjoy hip-hop you owe it to yourself to BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW!!!!!"
1,super large,"It is not logical at all, why L size should be like XXXXXL? I have a feeling that it is a fake model, there is not any size standard met. If your waist is 34-36 this pant is fine, but you also should have very fat legs. actually there should be explanation in product description what it looks like. I made mistake that did not trust other comments before me. Suggest do not make same mistake."
1,Small feels like a large,The sizes of these pants are way too roomy and lengthy for even a small. I normally wear size 30 pants and found these to be way too roomy on the legs. It seems to be made to fit people who have large thighs and legs. Maybe it shrinks a lot after a few washes? I dont want to risk to find out so I returned it.
2,too big for a small size,"for small size it is way to big, not sure what standards were used to make this pant. will not order again"
3,These are HUGE!,My husband isn't exactly small. He always wears a large in pants. These are about two inches too long so be really can't wear them to the gym. As far as I'm concerned they were too expensive to be just lounge pants.
2,Not a good fit,"These pants have potential, but the company really failed on the execution. I'm 5'11"" and usually wear a 36"" waist 32"" inseam. Based on the other reviews, I decided to go with a Large. Unfortunately they were still too big. The waist was ok, but I definitely had to tighten it. The length was ridiculous. They have cinchers at the bottom of the legs to tighten the cuffs, but that makes them look like MC Hammer pants, which haven't been fashionable since 1990. The deal breaker for me, though, was that the right pocket had a hole in it. It appeared to have been a manufacturing defect, so I returned them to Amazon. If the fit would have been better, I probably would have just exchanged them, but since they fit so poorly, I wasn't willing to risk it and just got a refund instead."
5,"I bought it for my husband birthday, it looks nice and he loves it because he likes the style and the quality.","it is nice and good for my husband, it is the best brand and preferable for him. it is his size, because when i read the customers reviews, they all said that it is a big size, for that I ordered medium instead of large and it looks nice on my hsuband. He loves it toooooooooooo muchhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
1,Sizing???,"I'm 6'6"" tall with 36w 36l jeans size and i was hoping these could fit me nice since they come in tall size. I've ordered large tall and I was so disappointed when they came. They were the same length as the regular large size!!! They were nowhere close to other pants I have in large tall size. Adidas should start making pants that could fit tall people. Sometimes it's so frustrating because it's so hard, almost impossible to find pants that can fit you nicely. The only plus is that returning of these pants was so easy, within couple of days the money had been returned to me."
3,layup pants,"i ordered XL, The pants arrived on time, however they are a little too big im fine with that, by reading all the other commits it seems these pants come oversized so you may want to order them a size smaller. (university red, white and black)"
3,PANTS,"I too should have ordered a small, but ordered a medium. They were a bit big, but after a wash they do shrink a little. So, these are a good pair of pants, but watch the sizing."
1,SIZE,"I've ordered Adidas Layup pants 2XL size and received approx. 5XL. Pants are ok, looks great but size is awful!"
5,What a dreamy recording.,Colin Davis has captured the essence of Elgar's most wonderful work. David Rendall is a wonderful Gerontius. His voice is sensitive and emotive and tells the story so well. The Angel- Anne Sofie von Otter shows the gentleness needed to carry the fragile Gerontius through his ordeal to heaven. The choral work is so beautiful. I would highly recommend this recording.
4,Good intro or review book.,This book was wrtten for all level of practioners in the traditional arts of shorin-ryu karate-do. It is a detailed training and instruction manual for those wishing to improve ther existing karate skills. The techniques and excercises have been broken down and described in great detail to make them easier to learn. This book is more specific to the Shobayash Shorin Ryu system and Shudokan system of karate-do.
1,Pffffffft,This is more about building muscle than getting a good cardio workout. You also need a lot more room than I have to do some of the moves she's showing here. Found her really annoying.
4,good overall,"Its was good overall workout. It was easy to follow not alot of complicated dance moves. I liked the weight segments throughout, was a nice variation. Some of the positions on the bench for stretching I didnt care for, position bothered my knee. So I did it on the floor. I enjoyed it."
5,Great Workout!,"This is one of the best at home dvds I have ever used. Very easy to follow with, works up a great sweat!"
5,Good Solid Workout!,"Yes it's true it take a little bit to get used too, but i think this is true for all workout DVDS. If you can stick it out 10 times you'll get to know it and really enjoy it. Even if you're a beginner you can modify the level, or do parts of the dvd and build up to it. I've had this for 3 years now and it's definatley one of my favourites. She isn't annoying and the routines are good, i haven't really gotten bored with it either. I use it once a week, and use other dvds on other days."
1,The first Karen Voight work out that I really hated,"I've always considered myself to be one of Karen Voight's biggest fans but I really hated this DVD. The steps were too tricky and done too quickly. There was no time to get used to a segment before she was on to the next one which was confusing and frustrating.And the music, annoying and repetitive with an occasional yelping sound that drove me nuts.Thank goodness for Amazon's low prices and Prime shipping so at least I didn't spend a lot of money on this."
3,"Frustrating at first, but eventually great!","This DVD is incredibly frustrating at first, Karen moves quickly and without warning making it hard to keep up with her. The first few times through the DVD, I got so frustrated that I turned this workout off and popped in my old DVD routine.After patience and many more tries, I got accustomed to her routine and was able to keep up. It's a high intensity work out; it will definitely get your heart pounding! She does alot of jumping and working over the step.All in all, this workout is not for someone who hopes to pop the DVD in and get into the `flow of things' right off the bat. But if you have patience to keep trying time after time, it is worth it!"
4,Great Workout!,"This workout makes me work hard, which I need. I'm 53 and in pretty good shape. It was hard to follow Karen at first, but the second time around, I was right in step with her. I was already into weights before I got this DVD, so the weight portion wasn't a challenge at first. After raising my weights a bit (she recommends 3-5 and 5-8, so I do 8's and 10's) I saw an immediate difference! If you want to sweat and burn calories, this DVD will do it. Love it."
4,"A little more cardio, please","You can always count on Karen Voight to give you a well-developed workout and Ultimate Step Circuit is no exception. I bought it because I was hoping that I'd get a great step workout from an instructor that brings a lot of positives to the field of video exercise. Unfortunately, there's only about 30 minutes of stepping and even when I chose the option where you do all the step segments at once, I couldn't hit my target heart rate for long enough to make it worthwhile. Likewise when I chose the combo (step segments alternating with toning) option on the DVD. But it's still a good overall workout option (vs. sitting on your couch and eating Cheetos) from one of the best instructors out there."
2,Corny,"I think this DVD was corny. I've been getting DVDs and VHS for years, as I would rather exercise at home then spend time getting to a from the gym. I've seen some with poor cueing, and others I do long enough that it's time to move on to something new. I'm not sure how to pinpoint or put words to my impression of this, but Karen seemed very unreal, and I want something more down to earth. I like seeing strong women that I would like to be more like, and while the guy and gal in the back were fine, Karen was just too annoying up front."
2,I hated this video,"I did not have a step but i thought it would be ok, its not. Without a step this video is useless. I used it once when i first got it and haven't touched it since. I do not even remember sweating when doing it."
5,This is very good product without a doubt,"Had Phillips CD recorder before and returned it to get this one.Music quality wise, they are both good, but this one was much more easy to use. Plus it had optical in/out, coaxial digital in/out, and analog in/out. there are not too many recorders that provide all these inputs and outputs.if you want perfect replications of your CDs, this is what you need. burning with computer cd writer, it converts the file to wav file and that reduces the music quality"
2,Improper Packing,The item was put inside a box that was about one centimeter smaller than the book. The book came damaged on the corners as a result. The book only cost 7$ but was shipped with another book valued at around 72$ so the value should not have been the cause for the mispackaging. Even if it had been valued low It should still have been packed correctly.
1,i ordered this with 2 day shipping it should have arrived today and i see it has not yet shipped - this is for my daughters clas,i am beyond furious - this was ordered with 2 day shipping which should have arrived today and it has not even shipped yet- my daughter has to have this book for her college class and she has a test tomorrow.
2,pleased with book but very lethargic delivery.,the atlas i ordered arrived in perfect condition but was very late. I probably waited for this book for a few weeks. And i had payed the extra fee for expedite delivery.
5,Nice Atlas,"Very organized and easy to read. I highly recommend it, as far as atlases go. It contains tons of useful information presented in an easily understandable way."
2,Didn't work for us,"We were looking to update our current Atlas - this didn't do it. Our current Atlas has far more maps, but not the current and new countries/labels/divisions. The new Atlas did not help up with this issue."
3,It's OK,I really wanted a book of maps. This Atlas has a lot of information maps rather then details of countries and cities. It seems good for what it is.
3,Sounds Great--NOT Designed for Computers,"No doubt about it, if there wasn't an issue of cell phone etc. inference this would be a superior product. Clearly this wasn't designed for PCs--aiport for subwoofer in front, bought TWO 2.1 systems (2 exrta satellites sitting in box), & left speaker constantly receives extremely annoying inference with any cell, BlackBerry anywhere near it. 6 TRS amps have to connect to Soundblaster X-Fi interface (3 stereo mini)--expect to shell out another $50 or so to even connect it. And forget about tech ""support,"" they're rude, stupid & entirely nonresponsive.2nd purchase is an improvement over the 1st, not as common & loud ""beeping noise."" But don't kid yourself that this system was even anything but an afterthought for PC use."
3,water bottle tote,I ordered this to keep my water cold longer and to take to the beach. I ordered in early June and didn't recieve it untill late July. It did not come in time to take it to the beach even though I order it about 6 weeks in advance. I really haven't tried it out.
2,Does NOT fit CamelBak .4 liter kids bottle,"Really nice cover if it fit the bottle I intended it for. I tried really hard to cram the bottle in there but couldn't make it work. Unfortunately this seller requires a $3 restocking fee and you have to pay return shipping, so not worth returning. I will see if I have anything else it will fit on, but I am disappointed that this vendor requires the restocking fee which just seems ridiculous for such a small product. also, since this shows up as a ""related product"" for the CamelBak .4 liter kids bottle, I just wanted to make sure others didn't make the same mistake I did."
5,handy,This is a nice bottle holder and keeps drinks cold for a while. It clips onto bag nicely and can be washed easily when the time comes for that. handy and convenient item.
2,fits but starting to rip at the seams,"I bought this to go over my son's Kleen Kanteen 12 oz. bottle. It fits but after 2 washes on the delicate cycle and air drying the stitching came undone. I was able to resew it, but am disappointed in the workmanship.It does keep my son's bottle insulated, so it works for that purpose."
1,Strap broke after 2 hours of use,"I ordered the hot pink/orange color. Unfortunately, the snap on the strap broke after it pulled away from the fabric after only 2 hours of use. In the limited experience I had with it, it kept my daughter's sippy cup from getting hot, but I cannot say it kept it cold or even cool. What really frustrated me about this purchase was the lack of customer service of the seller, The Baby's Gallerie. When I contacted them about getting a replacement, I was advised I had to cut off and mail the defective part at my expense. I was also really unimpressed with the Seller's tone in their response to me when I made alternate suggestions for proving the defect, such as an emailed picture that showed the defect. I found The Baby's Gallerie to be unprofessional and will not do business with them again."
4,"This is a great book, but...","You need to play it through at least once on your own. This book really ruined the game for me. I used it the first time through and all I did was look ahead to see what items were around, the bosses, and who I could get on my team. There was no mystery left in the game. By the time I finished I had gotten all the genies, weapons, and characters, so why play again? I think that you should play the game first without out it. Games are fun because you don't know what is going to happen. That is what creates the adventure."
2,"Helpful, but not always right","I have used Bradygames Strategy Guides for several games, and they were always helpful and normally the information is accurate. The maps in this strategy guide are extremely helpful if you want to find all the elements and items, but don't trust everything you read in the walkthrough. At least one section is so wrong that if you follow what the stratgy guide says, you will never get past that point in the game. The strategy guide is extremely helpful for those who never played Chronotrigger, and I doubt if anyone could recruit all the characters without using it, but don't trust it on startegy"
5,An Excellent Guide for a Fair Game,"Simply put, this guide is great. It's very detailed and has an excellent walkthrough that tries its best to avoid spoilers."
3,Mediocere sound quality for such an expensive speakerphone,"Mediocere sound quality for such an expensive speakerphone. When it worked, it was mediocere. I tried the Konftel 300 and the Panasonic TS730 as well. The Panasonic wins hands down, I was very surprised."
2,"Same old, same old","I am disappointed with this dvd. It calls itself an exercis dvd for over 50, then proceeds to show two women in already great shape, neither of which looks close to 50. I can and have done all the movements in the dvd on my own and find them so boring I can't keep it up.The overall quality of the disc is very good, but the person who apparently is doing the easier movements is hidden behind the other performer. If you are in faily good shape, and not easily bored, then this would be a good investment. It just isn't what I expected."
3,DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF THE OTHER HOOD MOVIES,"THIS WAS A MADE FOR TV MOVIE THAT AIRED ON TV A DECADE AGO. HERE'S THE PLOT; A TOUGH GANGSTA [BLAIR UNDERWOOD] IS IN PRISON AND IS ABOUT TO BE PAROLED PRETTY SOON. HOWEVER, THE PAROLE BOARD BELIEVES THAT HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE ON HIS OWN SO, THEY ALSO PAROLE HIS FATHER [LOU GOSSETT, JR.] WHO LEFT HIS SON AND HIS FAMILY 15 YEARS EARLIER. AND THEY ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN A HALFWAY HOUSE TOGETHER. KINDA SLOW MOVING, BUT, THIS IS AN OK MOVIE. HAS ENOUGH GOOD PERFORMANCES AND ENOUGH REALISTIC PLOTTING TO MAKE THIS AN ACCEPTABLE MOVIE. DESPITE WHAT THE BOX FOR THIS MOVIE MIGHT SAY, THIS ISN'T REALLY A PRISON MOVIE. CAUSE AFTER THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OR SO, IT ALL TAKES PLACE OUTSIDE OF PRISON."
4,A rare find,"My daughter is a leap day baby, and let me tell you - there aren't many books out there to explain her special birthday to her. This is a cute story, and she loves Pooh! We even read it to her class on her special birthday this past year."
3,Comes up short,"This book ships a BEA Weblogic that is EXPIRED before you even open the cover. Doesn't go over any of the J2EE tools like DeployTool or J2ee.bat that comes with J2sdkEE. The author relies on you using BEA Weblogic and shows you how to deploy beans with BEA. But nothing on how to deploy using other means. Maybe the author is getting a kickback from BEA.Other than that, the book does have good detail on the difference in enterprise beans"
5,Good for beginners,"I've used the O'Reilly book, the Sun tutorials, and this book (the Ed Roman book). This is the best of the bunch for getting started. The book gets you writing simple EJBs and deploying them into the weblogic server (trial cd included). It really doesn't get too deep into issues of how to design your application, building your cluster of app servers, or anything that might be construed as a ""advanced"".After going through this book, you will not have mastered J2EE, but you will know how to write EJBs, which is a pretty involved process. If you don't know how to write EJBs, avoid the O'Reilly and Sun tutorials, which are tedious, long, and tend to meander."
2,Reads like a Sun advertisement,"I must admit that I have only read the first half of Mastering EJB - I got sick of all the buzzwords and praises for EJB. It really sounds like an advertisement for EJBs and Java technology in general. If you like Sun's style of hyping their technology to death, you may actually like this book. But if you are more critical of all the promises the author (and Sun) makes about EJB, Java, components, re-usability of components in a closed-source world and hate all those articifial words that E, you will probably throw this book away..."
2,Look out!,"I don't get how this book only got extraordinary reviews. At the very first example when the reader has to deploy its very first bean, it goes ""Well, now it's time for you to check your container documentation to know how to do this...hopefully someday we will have great ides that will sove this for us"" Thanks a lot! It doesn't even mention how to generate stubs and skeletons and besides that, it suggests you to go look in some messy documentation to learn how to do it. By the way, the book comes with weblogic apllication server, so nothing more logical than using it to illustrate the examples don't you think? What's the point in writting a book and tell people to look in the documentation ? I had to go to the developer's connection to get this info. The context in the book is good, but if you're looking for great hands on ready to go examples, better look somewhere else."
4,Excellent book to understand EJB,Excellent book to understand EJB. I downloaded this book from theServerside.com ( PDF format) and read it. The pdf content cannot be printed and it can be read online only. I will wait for the next edition to be out ( chapters for review are already available on theServerside.com) and then buy it. The next edition will cover EJB 2.0.
4,Excellent book for understanding the BIG picture,"THe initial chapters of the book are excallet, they totally explain the overall picture. This is necessary for developing EJB. The only main disadvantage of this book is that the actual EJB examples have been written using EJB 1.0 specification. This is a major problem since there are some differences between EJB 1.1 and EJB 1.0. The RMI-IIOP chapter is also an excallent chapter,since it starts by explanning the working of CORBA, and how RMI fits into it. Generally other books just come to the point and explain RMI-IIOP, but with this book I totally understood how and why RMI-IIOP fits into the big picture."
2,A so so book,"The major trouble of this book is it fails to convince reader why EJB is good. All the contents on that issue look like Sun commericials. It seems that the book was not written for programmers, who won't take anything for granted. After reading this book, my impression is EJB is only an extension of RMI and CORBA and, even worse, an overhyped naive technology. I am a Java programmer. I know EJB is good. I'm so sad that this book cannot even convince me."
3,"Covers EJB 1.0, but not J2EE","This book provides decent coverage of basic EJB 1.0 (EJB 1.1 is the current version) but it's light on technical details. According to its title this book is supposed to cover J2EE, but this material is brief and surprisingly insubstantial. Management types might find this book useful, but real developers should look elsewhere."
2,Don't buy this book!,"This book is not current. It only covers EJB 1.0? The current version is EJB 1.1, so this book is not of much use. I plan to return it. I recommend O'Reilly's EJB book by Richard Monson-Haefel instead. The O'Reilly book is on the current version, EJB 1.1, and is probably the best Java book I have ever read."
2,My Honest Opinion,"I bought this book because of the fact that EJB is a very highly regarded field of Java technology, and because this book got some good reviews, however, I felt that it wasn't exactly adequate. I could barely pay attention to what I was reading through the first three chapters, and it was quite confusing to me. I stopped using the book because it was so frustrating. I had to return the book because I simply didn't have the resources. I downloaded the software that the book suggested, but there is no troubleshooting at all in the book, and though I followed every help guide I could find on the internet, I still could not manage to start up an EJB server. This was on my personal computer though. Also this book offered no help on usage of deployment tools that had to be used to deploy the ejb's, all it said was that you had to use one supplied by the vendor to deploy them. For me, I felt this book was quite inadequate."
5,This is the best book,"This is the best book I ever read. It is very-well organized. Each chapter tells exactly what the title implies. There are also many very good examples in there, they are strongly helping readers to understand what the concepts the chapter delivers. Besides these, this book also cover lots of related topics, such as Corba, Xml, RMI, etc. Though they are in appendix, they are illustrated very clearly. There is only one small thing I don't think it's good. This book use WebLogic as the EJB container. It would be better to use Sun's EJB container, because it is free and everyone can get it."
4,Good and weak,"This is book is an excellent start for a complete novice todistributed computing, EJB and java related technologies. The authorsway of repeating the same point and beating around the bush distractedme a lot of times. But this book helped me a lot in getting lot ofpoints straight and having a feel of many unknown territories. Goodjob. Lot of diagrams helped me to move on faster and grasp the ideaspeedier."
4,"Great book , but a little outdated","This is a great book about EJB. The author doesn't simply teach you how to program. He explains the rationals and all related technologies in a very clear way. You can really understand what J2EE and EJB are about. Unfortunately, this edition covers EJB 1.0 and is becoming outdated. Although the book has an appendix about EJB 1.1, you have to edit the books examples if you want to run them in contemporary EJB container products. Get the next edition! It will be published anytime soon and promises!"
3,"Good, but could have been better....","Ed Roman has done a pretty good job of assembling the information regarding the complexities of EJB into one volume. However I think the title of this book is a bit misleading. While, yes, this book *does* discuss EJB 1.1 and the Java 2 Enterprise Edition, it is presented more as an *afterthought*. The bulk of the book (about 60%) is written for EJB 1.0 (which has glaring differences from the J2EE implementation of EJB 1.1). Toward the back of this tome is where you'll find a section that could have basically been titled; ""Now, THIS is how you do EJB in the J2EE"".Basically the information is good, but the organization leaves something to be desired. In this instance the Monson-Haefel book on EJB from O'Reilly is much better (the EJB 1.0 and 1.1 differences are compared and contrasted throughout the reference). If you buy *one* EJB book, get the Monson-Haefel book, but if you buy two, get this one also. The combination of them is actually quite good!"
3,Easter Egg Toys,"I had no idea these calico critters were so small. They arrived and I realized I could not use them as the primary Easter toy for my granddaughter. However, I decided to put these cute little bunny critters in plastic eggs that abound on this holiday. I have collected several small toys to put in these eggs. The calico critters will be the most popular of these toys.I have two complaints about these critters, the size and the cost. The critters are much too small to play with, and the cost is prohibitive for the size.Would only recommend for collectors.prisrob 04-01-12Calico Critters Cozy Cottage Starter SetCalico Critters Caramel Cat Family"
3,IT'S OK?,"I have over 600 cds,because I hate radio.(boring) multiple cd machine with RANDOM PLAY is what I want. I bought a JVC-MC222BK. Plays great.RANDOM PLAY works good.Goes from cd to cd & song to song. The problem? When you program in select cds. RANDOM PLAY will only play the whole cd,not song search. I put it back in the box.(where it is now) I got a PIONEER PD-F1007 300 machine. works much better! Plus you can plug two of them together,to equal 600! The JVC XL-MC222BK is a good player. Amazon.com has a great price. But it does have set limits hard core music fans will not deal with."
1,Poor Quality,"I received my CD changer as a gift for my birthday,and every since I have received it, it hasn't worked properly, I put up with it because it was a gift, but now I have 200 of my favorite CD's suck in it. I would not advise anyone to purchase this CD changer."
1,Very Heartbroken!,"I received this CD changer as a birthday gift from my husband. It skipped so badly on the first 5 CD's I tried to play, I had to send it back. I thought it must have just been a faulty machine & the next one was bound to work better. The replacement unit worked okay initially, but would not play burned cd's or cd's that had even the tiniest scratches. (My OLD discman (from the 80's) played the CD's that this brand new JVC unit would not play!).Now, a few months later, there are only a few of my CD's that this piece of #!@&* will play. I am utterly disappointed & upset that I spent so much time cataloging 200 CD's into a player that doesn't work. I wish I had my old single CD-player back (We sold it at our garage sale right after I received the first JVC changer). Bummer!"
3,Do not be misled,"Do not be misled: The 1993 movie, ""Dangerous Game,"" starring Harvey Keitel and Madonna, is NOT the same movie as the 1991 film of the same title. As of January 2005, the 1993 Keitel/Madonna film has NOT been released on Region 1 DVD (for North America). Unfortunately, Amazon has confused the two, and features reviews of the 1993 film (from customers in the UK and France, where it apparently HAS been released) under the product description for the 1993 film.The 1991 film, ""Dangerous Game,"" was directed by Stephen Hopkins, and stars Steven Grives and Marcus Graham. It's basically about a group of teens trapped overnight in a department store with a killer.The 1993 film, ""Dangerous Game,"" was directed by Abel Ferrara, and stars Harvey Keitel and Madonna. This one's basically about a filmmaker's adultery while shooting a movie.(Since this review is strictly for the sake of clarification, I'm giving it a ""neutral"" 3.)"
3,Dangerous Game,"Slipping past the surveillance systems of a cavernous department store, a computer whiz-kid and his friends break in, then find they can't get out until the next morning. But when one of the group is brutallu murdered, they realize they aren't alone. They're being tracked down like animals by a maniacal cop with a demented vendetta against one of the unsuspecting biys- and a twisted lust for one of the terrified girls. Stalked from floor to floor, fighting for their lives, the kid's night of innocent fun exploed into an unspeakable nightmare of a decidely DANGEROUS GAME."
3,Interesting and very dark,"Starring Madonna (don't let that put you off) Harvey Keitel and James Russo, and directed by Abel Ferrera, this is an interesting psychological drama about a directors obsession with his film, and the stars breakdown of reality during ther making of it.A dark, interesting but flawed film, which is well acted (certainly top 3 for Madonna, Evita and Desperately Seeking Susan being her best) but leaves you unsatisfied because of the ambiguous ending and that the film they are making seems to be more interesting than the actual film!Its worth noting, that Madonna refused to do any promotional work on this film, as she was disappointed with the edit. Apparently her character was much stronger prior to editting than the victim portrayed in the final cut.No extras on the DVD."
5,Help just at a time it's needed most,"Doug Florzak's Free Agent Marketing Guide is more than just 100+ marketing tips; its success comes from its combination of concisely-stated, actionable ideas, case studies,and resources.The case studies bring the ideas to life, the resources point the way to carefully-chosen books and web site resources that can help readers learn more about a particular approach or technique.At a time of rapid technological change, the Free Agent Marketing Guide provides a needed overview of tools and techniques combined with a one-stop, carefully-compiled ""centralized resource"" to keep everything straight.A valuable bonus: the book is impeccably designed and produced. The design isn't ""padded"" with decorative touches that distract and unnecessarily increase the page count."

5,Wonderful visual book.,"I originally purchased this great book for my baby girl because of the great colors on each page. We have read this about a hundred times, and continue to read it still past 4 years old.I recently purchased this as a gift for a little boy who adores elephants, it quickly became his favorite book. This is a very endearing book and easy to read and enjoy, will be a family favorite!"
1,Very little relevance to the title,"I've just finished reading this book and it was hard work. I lived through this era as a wide-eyed youngster, much of it spent in the Kings Road, Chelsea. This is a one-sided chronological listing of the author's own music tastes - with some catalogued references to the Royal Court Theatre thrown in for good measure - but with no exciting substance. Where is Christopher Hunter's ground-breaking cabaret restaurant THE COUNTRY COUSIN? Where is the acknowledgement to the effects of gay liberation on the Kings Road of the '60s and '70s? My eyes are sore after trudging through the tiny print of this paperback. One day someone will really write with passion and knowledge of this mind-blowing era of London's history. This book isn't it."
2,it wont wake up!!!!,"i bought this scale while in baking school. i have had it for almost a year now and its pooping out on me. when i get to work in the morning the darn thing wont wake up. i have to turn it on a few times just to get it ""warmed up"" and then when i am weighing something its not accurate anymore because the numbers count down and the product is still in the bowl. its so annoying.so i gave this item 2 stars, because it worked great for a while... i wonder if this scale has a warranty, like the other salter scales?"
3,good basic scale,"I've had this scale for about 3 years, and it's worked fine, and seems fairly accurate. My biggest problem (and the reason for the 3-star rating) is that, when measuring in ounces, it's only accurate to a quarter of an ounce. For most things this is fine, but I've run into some situations (particularly when measuring small amounts of things like baking powder/soda or salt) when accuracy down to a tenth of an ounce (or less) would have been preferable. I love not having to bother with measuring cups any more, but with this scale you still have to break out the measuring spoons to measure small amounts.Not really sure what ""DeepFreeze3"" is referring to with respect to this scale being difficult to use. I've never had a problem reading the LED or pressing the buttons, all of which seem perfectly serviceable to me. Cleaning has never been an issue."
3,Good for First Kitchen Scale Purchase,"This was the first kitchen scale I've ever used. What a difference a scale makes in baking! After baking a batch of cookies you no longer have a sink full of dirty measuring cups and bowls. The only drawback to this scale is it isn't precise enough. It only weighs in 5 gram or 1/4 oz increments so if you need an ingredient that weighs 106 grams or 1/8 oz, the scale will only weigh 105/110 grams or 1/4 oz. Once you get into weighing ingredients you find this lack of specificity inadequate.As far as its ability to weigh liquids, I've found I rarely use it."
2,And it went out...with a whimper.,"Being that the Salter 3007 Aquatronic Kitchen Scale has an extremely non-ergonomic design, I found that cleanups were a MAJOR pain!! I also ended up hating how the LCD readout was over to the right, instead of at the front where it should've been (JEEZ!! All the times I had to spend bending my head sideways just to see what the measurement was!!) The buttons? I found that they had to be pressed more than two to three times just to even work!! And, finally, the measurements I ended up getting just weren't that accurate.Anybody thinking of getting this scale should instead go for the Salter 3003 Aquatronic Glass Kitchen Scale. It's ergonomic design allows for easier cleanups, the LCD readout is at the front (where it should be), the buttons actually work the first time you press them, and measurements are much more accurate. Plus, it isn't made of cheap plastic. It's made of sturdy stainless steel."
4,"Good scale, gave up the ghost after 3-4 years","I've had this scale for 3-4 years. It has generally been very useful and nice to have. The display is hard to read when you're using a large bowl or plate. Sometimes it doesn't zero on the first try, which is annoying if you don't catch it and start putting in ingredients. I've only had to replace the batteries once. But now the display has started to fail, so I'm replacing it with theOxo Food Scaleon the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated."
3,Not Quite Up to Par,"The Cella Dwellas second LP is a far cry from the classic Realms 'n Reality. They've changed their style somewhat, straying a bit from the spooky yet hilarious beats and lyrics they previously employed. Not that the beats are wack, they just lack definition. Only two tracks really stand out for me. ""Stand Up"" is just blazin', while ""Verbal Slaughter"" featuring Inspectah Deck just cranks. All in all this is a good effort, but it isn't spectacular."
3,dwellas....return of the underground,"The general opinion seems to be that this album is stronger +better than their 1st, i would have to agree. This is a huge step up for them. Where the production let them down before sometimes, i think, they've addressed that and improved on it. Nick Wiz blesses them with some of his finest beats and their lyrics dont let him down. There's no doubt that these 2 mc's are skilled lyricists with good strong deliveries with catchy punchlines+metaphors. They also bounce off each other+compliment each other's style beautifully. But i found the album a little repetitive. Their are 6 stand out cuts (""dwellas"", ""frontline"", ""the last shall be 1st"", ""ready to rock"", ""leakage"" and ""ill colabo"" w/ organised konfusion) but the rest are either too similar or just very average. Overall its a head nodding album with 6 bangers and 1 or 2 other suprises on it. Nice to have in your collection, particularly for the 6 bangers!!!"
3,Needs much more depth.,"Fascinated by the topic, I devoured this book in less than two hours, but it was quite unsatisfying. Mr. Twichell deserves credit for floating his ideas out there, but the book reads like a high schooler's essay drawn from only a handful of Internet sources. There's no magic behind the curtain, only a feeling of emptiness. The book suffers from too much unsubstantiated speculation, too many irrelevent personal asides about family, and not enough first-hand research and investigation. The author begins by asking the right questions, but unfortunately never successfully or substantively draws us closer to a single answer. If you're looking for substance and a scholarly approach, seek out the masters, Erich Von Daniken and Zecharia Sitchin."
5,This is goood!!,"I like these episodes are fun!!! I watched episode 14 ""A Nice Place to Visit"" They were held in Ray's Funeral. I saw the Las Vegas episode. Late George Peppard, Dirk Bendict, Dwight Shultz, and Mr.T are the best!!!"
5,"A PLAN COMES TOGETHER WITH ""THE A-TEAM: SEASON ONE!""","""The A-Team"" is one of the greatest shows to come out of the 1980's. With its clever mix of great action, humor, and writing, the show was always great fun. Now, with season one of the show available on DVD, you can see the adventures from the very beginning. The two-hour premiere episode, ""Mexican Slayride,"" is a great beginning, despite the fact that the guy playing Face is horrible in the role (Thank God this guy was replaced). Other standout episodes include ""A Small and Deadly War,"" ""Black Day at Bad Rock,"" and the season finale ""A Nice Place to Visit,"" which partially serves as a tribute to the men who served in Vietnam.While the picture is a bit grainy, it does little to detract from this great collection! If you're a fan of the show, or new to the series, then check out ""The A-Team: Season One"" on DVD. As Mr. T would say, you'll ""have the jazz"" when you do!Program/DVD Grade: A"
1,THE A TEAM SEASON 1,****WARNING PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW***I have attempted to order this from The Amazon Store and twice have received a bootleg version of season 1. Amazon has shipped a dvd in a clear case that features Mr. T as the prominent image on the right with the other three actors in small boxes on the left. Even though the back of the dvd makes it look official it is 100% fake. I have contacted Universal Studios Entertainment and asked them about the dvd and they informed me that is was a fake. The dvd should look like the picture above but it doesn't. If you don't believe me please go to [...]and ask them yourself.
3,"Loved the series, but the DVD set is so-so","This is a DVD set of the first season. That is it, no extras, and no remastering or enhancements. In the first two episodes (the pilot) the color shifts in a few places. Also, I found the voices not quite in sync. Maybe off a 1/10th of a second, but it was noticable. It's the A-Team on DVD...that is great. It's just that the DVD's are plain."
5,NICE,"Nice, I'm so happy this is finally coming out. There aren't shows like this on anymore. I can't wait to own every season. This is a must own for EVERYONE!!! I pity da fool that don't buy this!"
3,I love when a plan comes together!,"""I love when a plan comes together!"" How can anyone forget that? LOLA very entertaining show, with a great cast.The writing was poor, though."
3,Good 80's Tv Classic Show,The stories of these 4 'Nam vets that survives as soldiers of fortune to hire if em if ya can find them and have a problem and noone else can help lasted for 4 seasons.They were a crack commando that were sent to prision for a crime they didn't commit after they escaped from a maximum security stockade to the LA underground.The cons: the no violence or no death of nobody seen on camera or the gun fights were nobody gets shot.I only give 3 stars because the decision of Universal of no including English language subtitles.They include English captions thing that can't be displayed on my PAL Tv setdue to system restraints.I hope Universal look forward this thinking on the no US or no English countries or the deaf or hard of hearing people that needs that subtitles.
3,Entertaining,I watched The A-Team when it started on primetime TV in the 80's and though this is not a TV show I want to own on DVD I did enjoy watching this show when it was on TV and it was pretty entertaining. It got some heat from the critics but I didn't think it was a terrible show and the 80's cheese factor of this show make it fun and amusing to watch and if you have a friend who owns this boxset it is worth borrowing and watching it and I'm sure it's worth buying if it is one of your absolute favorite TV shows and I definitely think The A-Team is a lot better then what the critics say about it but it's not tops on my list of TV shows to own on DVD but that doesn't mean that I don't like the show but just that there are other TV show boxsets that I want more!
1,funny if you are a preadolescent....,"I was 10 in the early 80's. At that time, Simon and Magnum were thursday night treats. People were actually shot in helping to take out villains and there was substance to those 2 shows. However, the A-Team was Cannell's defanged action show involving Nam vets who run from the government and anonymously help ""clients."" No one is ever shot despite tons of crashes and bullets. I was huge Hazzard fan and thought that show had more intellect and thought than the A-Team from a 10 year old mind at the time. Shows like the A-Team killed the best era of tv in the 70's and early 80's (Rockford, Starsky and Hutch, Magnum, Simon and Simon,etc) and subjected us to post PI and police creampuff hits like Cosby, Full House,etc. Here's an 80's analogy. Those 4 shows were to Judas Priest in metals prime, and A-Team was Poison who defanged and killed metal. If anyone prefers A-Team to those 4 shows, you probably preferred Winger to Judas Priest."
4,The only containing the extended version of FRANKENSTEIN,"Extraordinary: this is the band that spawned Ronnie Montrose, Rick Derringer and Dan Hartman. And then there's the extraordinary Edgar Winter himself, younger brother of bluesman Johnny, and also an albino.The single of the classic jazz/rock track 'Frankenstein' made it to the top of the US charts in 73, but it was pallid in comparison to the LP version here. The Winter Group played the tune for British TV at the time -- on the 'Old Grey Whistle Test' -- and it was a virtuoso, multi-instrumental performance, with Winter dashing between saxophone, timbales and ARP synth.The two other great reasons for buying this album are the well-crafted 'Undercover Man' and 'Rock'N'Roll Boogie Woogie Blues'. The guitar work throughout this album is superb, but with both Montrose and Derringer present, what else could you expect?"
1,Disgraceful,"I've been in Delta Chi for most of my college experience, and the man selling this should be ashamed of himself. Not only is he overcharging, but he is selling what should be one of the most important books of his life. I don't know how you can put something like this on Amazon and still call yourself a DChi."
3,"Excellent shoe, but Very great","Excellent shoe, but the statures are deceptive, I buy a stature 8,5 and seems that a stature 10 outside."
2,Break Very Easily,"I've had several Gold N Hot irons and I officially give up. They break very easily. Never dropped them or handled the roughly, plastic just starts breaking off the things. There is a plastic tip on the handle that has broken off 2 of my irons. That leaves the iron unusable because the handle is too hot to use without it. Another problem is that the irons are so slow heating up. I definitely do not recommend these irons. I was going to only give 1 star, but after they finally heat up and before they break, they are nice irons."
5,Excelente trabajo,Este album esta a la altura de las grabaciones anteriores de Alejandro. Alejandro Sanz es un verdadero musico que no deja de sorprenderme con su creatividad y talento. Ecelente trabajo Alejandro!
1,It's no my cup of tea.,I listened to a couple of samples and I'm not impressed.Maybe the songs would sound better if someone with a good voice interpret them.
1,are these people crazy? 5 stars? No way.,"this CD is really bad... don't waste your money and time. if you want to buy sanz's music, do the MAS deal. don't waste your money on this...."
4,Lovely Spanish pop,"Alejandro Sanz is one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary Latin music. He is as much a poet and performance artist as he is a singer, and his dramatic style of singing is evident on this CD, ""El Alma al Aire."" The CD starts off with a more serious-sounding performance on ""Cuando nadie me va,"" and then takes a more exuberant turn on the next song, ""Hay un universo...."" Most of the songs have a mellow quality, with an occasionally ethereal sound. The title song makes effective use of a female (or is it falsetto?) chorus and horn section. Overall, this is not Sanz's best CD; I think he has done stronger work on ""Mas"" and on ""Alejandro Sanz 3."" But ""El Alma el Aire"" is still a strong CD of Spanish-language pop music."
4,"Solid, but not spectacular","Perhaps ""Más"" is really hard to top. There seems to be a more relaxed Alejandro in this album, with more happiness and less anxiety, but the music and the lyrics - especially the lyrics - are beginning to lean towards the generic. His words no longer break my heart as they used to in ""3."" There is less poetic imagery that so defined his last two albums. However more often than not he is still sad, his voice is still beautifully sultry, and from ""Cuando nadie me ve"" you just know that he is still there. It just takes a little getting used to. All in all ""El Alma Al Aire"" is a wonderful album, but I think ""Más"" or ""3"" is more representative of him. They just made me go, wow."
1,Hype vs Talent,"I listen to a lot of spanish music. I understand most of it and what I don't, I like the rhythm. This was not what I expected. He had many good reviews on univision. Very very very very very easy listening. Lawrence Welk move over! Maybe it'll get better with time and more listening."
5,"No puede haber otro mejor, o si?","""a veces doy vueltas, doy mil volteretas, a veces me encierro tras puertas abiertas...""estas palabras viene de uno de los seres mas profundos que he visto en mi vida. De su vos sale todo, de su vos y de su garganta sale el alma al aire. No dudes en comprar este cd, no te vas a arrepentir. Solo acuerda que para escuchar este cd, tienes que cerrar tus ojos y dejar que la musica te lleve, has eso y disfrutaras a lo maximo este cd."
2,"El Alma Rodeada de Violines, Coros, etc.","I guess this album is really romantic if you like to hear a singer try to fit a bunch of wordsintoatinyspacelikethis without worrying about things like melody or whether it makes sense to fill every possible corner of the mix with strings and backing vocals. There's absolutely nothing with the heat of ""Corazon Partio"" on this self-indulgent effort. On the upside, ""Cuando Nadie Me Ve"" is a pleasant ballad, and ""Quisiera Ser"" is energetic in a Luismi sort of way. ""Tiene Que Ser Pecado"" is a spicy jazz number that's also worth a listen, at least until the inexplicable mountain of backing vocals greets you on the chorus. Overproducing a perfectly good song? Now that's a sin."
3,A Bit of a Stretch...,"While I agree witht the other reviewers concerning the characters and ending, my chief complaint was the dialogue. Found it stilted and artificial (does anyone really say ""Yes, I am beset with problems"") Early scene in cemetary was so artificial, I had to push to proceed, but Tessa was a pleasure. Would try another book by Thayer, but this didn't make may favorites list."
2,"Obvious plot, rushed ending","While this is an easy read, a good ""beach book,"" it had several problems. One is that instead of foreshadowing, the author practically boinks you on the head -- so many of the events ""revealed"" at towards the end were obvious from the very beginning. Additionally, the ending was rushed. After setting the scene for a custody battle, and allowing the reader to see various scenes leading up to it [e.g., the Guardian ad Litem's meetings with multiple characters], we get none of the actual custody trial. Finally, the problems of certain characters just seem to disappear by the ending, with no explanation on if they dealt with them or how, and how they adjusted to the ruling in the custody case. My first thought was ""Is that it?"" Haven't read any of the author's other books, but this one didn't really encourage me to do so."
2,Waiting to find out someone is their own grandparent.....,"One of my close friends who I frequently swap good books with loaned me this one thinking that it would rank up on my new list of favorites... WRONG!Although I did like the premise of the story, I was almost repulsed by the immense amount of private relationships involved... I was seriously waiting to flip a page and hear ""Dueling Banjos"" come strumming out of the book. Everyone knows everyone else and is tied in to someone who's related to this other character who is the first one's... you get the point I'm sure. It's a blurry line where it comes from ""What a twist!"" to ""Ok, now what?""It's not a bad read, necessarily. It was engrossing, and decently written... My chief complaint is the lack of understanding on when it's a great literary twist and when it's just overdone."
4,Hold the Goods in Style !,Yeah...these just do the job and hold your package nicely. You will like it and so will she. Recommended.
2,What's with all the stilted language?,"These guys have a point (I think) and it may very well be a good, as well as humorous one...but it's buried under pompous analogies and flowery phrases intended to amuse but, instead, annoy. Too bad the authors' need to demonstrate what great writers they are got in the way of clearly and simply getting their message across."
1,Not worth the five bucks.,"This is a VERY silly book. Also, totally non-threatening to any and all women past the age of 19 who have respect for themselves. Furthermore, there isn't a ""Rules"" woman alive that has anything to worry about since she wouldn't give the time of day to any man who attempted to emotionally abuse her in any of the ways suggested by these two authors."
2,Barely worth the paper it is written on,I mistakenly purchased this book thinking it was the RULES FOR GETTING LAID by Graff and Schwartz. Boy was I disapointed. This attempt at humor does nothing more than insult the intelligence of us men who are intersted in really doing something with our lives and making a difference. There is no way that this book matches up to the power of books like How to Succeed With Women or other titles out there on dating.
2,WARNING: Not for the politically correct,"First, read ""The Rules."" Then, before opening this book, place tongue firmly in cheek, make sure the eyeballs are free to roll around in their sockets, settle back and enjoy. ""Rules"" girls who are afraid these guys have encroached on their turf can rest easy. No ""Rules"" girl or ""Code"" guy would ever get past the first date, if there even WAS a first date. This book is an SNL-like parody of ""The Rules,"" and should be taken as such. In that light, it's a hoot in some places, a bore in others. Fortunately, it's short; about a 3-hour read."
4,Very entertaining! I laughed my a@#% off!,"To begin with I am a ""rules girl"" ( and it does work by the way :)regardless of all the remarks to the contrary- MEN DO NOT LIKE TO BE CHASED)But I digress, this book is one of the funniest things I have read in years and it is written in good fun, after all- if a man ACTUALLY did these things he would have no love life to speak of or a very poor one.Some of the hints, however are very good- especially the ""double messages"" these I found helpful to use on either sex :)They do work on men, also.I believe in getting as much info on the ""enemies tactics: to better subdue them as possible- after all ""all is fair in love and war"" and everyone knows that one person is always in control of the relationship- I want to make sure it is me!:)If that sounds calculating, so be it, it's better than being a doormat."
4,Good Deal,I needed these to shore up a shelving unit in my kitchen whose holes and dowels didn't line up. They worked just fine. I had expected them to be silver however when the came they were brass.
3,Bodysuit,"White body suit was much thinner than I anticipated... even a nude bra was still visible, so beware of this before going with the white."
2,not consistant,I purchased two body suits. One black and the other purple. They were both mediums. The black fit great and feels great. The purple one is of a different fabric. It rides up and feels uncomfortable.
4,Fairly nice,"The leotard definitely runs small but knowing this before I purchased it, I had wanted it a bit snug anyhow. The crotch snaps are positioned way far back so its a huge pain in the ass to get the fastened if you have a big ol butt and hips like I do. The black is very soft, not shiny and gives you a nice slim look."
2,Runs very easily. Only for peope with short torsos,The material is nice but it runs very easily. This body suit is for short torsos. If you have a long torso look elsewhere.
2,Bodysuit,Nice bodysuit but they run about 2-3 sizes too small. I would recommend ordering 2-3 sizes larger than you normally would wear.
2,Too Small,"I should have read more on the item it was too small and by the time I went to wear it the time to send back and exchange had expired, but it is good quality, so I am sure I would have worn it multiple times."
3,Horrible customer service,First off I read the reviews about the seller and started off feeling confident.However. After my purchse I was provided with no tracking numbers even a week after my purchase.My credit card was already charged and I didnt even know the status of my order.I contacted the seller on three seperate occasions and never recieved a response. I couldn't file a claim because the system wouldnt permit me. I was furios and just when I had given up on the thought of my merch arriving it came USPS. They experience wouldnt have been so bad if the seller would have responded and let me know something and not leave me hanging. The dvds arrived in perfect condition but one of the disc was scratched and skips at the most suspenseful part of the movie. I would buy again from this sell because at least I'll know what to expect.
2,Low DVD quality,"I'm very disappointed by the DVD quality. For all three DVD's in the set I have experienced problems with skipping and disruption of the movies. I played the DVD's on different players and the movies stop at the same location. The first problem occurs in the pilot movie about 1 hour into the movie. Anyone experience the same problem?The DVD's don't appear to be scrathed or damaged, maybe the studio created the DVD's using a bad master?"
2,Another Great T.V Gem Ruined By Poor D.V.D Quality,"I am very happy to see that season one of 'Murder, She Wrote' has finally been released. It's so great because season one is so wonderful. However, my biggest disappointed with this set is that it is very poor by DVD standards. They didn't even bother to have the discs look nice. I know that's really picky but still, I was really hoping it would be a nicer set, especiallysince the boxed set is nice. Other than the way it looks, it'spoor quality. There are absolutely no special features, not even a commentary! Everyone out there who makes DVD sets should know by now that people expect a lot more than this when it comes to a DVD set, and 'Murder She Wrote' really rips youoff in that department.Otherwise, I am very glad that this first season is on DVD.The show is wonderful. It's so great to have it on a DVD set. Again though, for season two they should really think about dressing up the DVD set more."
3,The Dreaded Double-Sided Disks,"While I love Angela Lansbury and her character, Jessica Fletcher, I do hate double-sided disks. There must be many people who have trouble reading the text ""in the round"" and therefore have to wait until the disk is in the player before they know what it contains.In my opinion it would be a great service to collectors to abolish double-sided disks. The very least one could expect is that this fact is mentioned in the product description.I feel bad about giving only 3 stars for this excellent series, but I can only repeat that I find double-sided disks an abomination."
2,Disappointed,"I am disspointed with my order. I purchased the first season, looking forward to enjoying ""Murder Takes the Bus"". Due to my work schedule It was a awhile before I able to take the time view the espisode; and when I did I noticed that the tape freezes near the end of the movie. When I attemped to return this item, I found out I had to return within 30 days. I was one day late. I have purchased items from Amazon before and never had any problems until now. I have since discovered that other episodes in this series have freeze portions as well. Also I don't like that both sides of the dvd was used for recording and that could be why the quality is so poor."
3,My wife loves it!,"I bought this set for my wife. We did have to return the first delivery for performance issues. The second set had two problems, both corrected by cleaning our DVD player. Based on the other reveiws, it looks like the Mfr has a problem. Bottom line is she loves the set and looks at it a lot."
5,Love Angela Lansbury!,"I don't know what it is, but I have always felt drawn to Angela Lansbury as an Actress. From her acting in ""Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Paris"", ""Gaslight"" ( her first screen role with Ingrid Bergman & Charles Boyer ),to Disney's ""Beauty and The Beast"" or even ""The Harvey Girls""Murder She Wrote:It does have the occational cleavage/low necklines. That aside, it is a wonderful series and Angela Lansbury is wonderful from begining to end."
5,Wonderful service,"Anytime i order anything from Amazon its always on time, in excellent shape and something i loved. Would not order from anywhere else. I can always find anything i am looking for. Wonderful Website."
2,Inferior transfer to DVD,"I was also glad to finally see this on DVD, but have been disappointed by the inferior DVD quality. This seems to be a pattern with discs released by Universal Studios. The picture is grainy, dark, and fuzzy and below even current television standards. Universal could have re-mastered the sound and done a better digital transfer. I enjoyed this show but will not be buying additional seasons."
2,Doesn't hold up,"Sorry to be a spoiler here but I don't think this series stands the test of time. I too have fond memories of it but after viewing about half of this collection I've decided to put it away. I remember enjoying Angela Lansbury very much but there always was something that seemed forced with her portrayals & after revisiting these shows I've come to the conclusion that I spend more time ""wanting to like her"" than actually involving myself in the plots. ""Mystery,"" for some reason has never been a forte of Hollywood. I've a feeling it isn't the creative abilities of the writers as much as the nervousness of producers worrying about catering to a greater than 13 year old mentality that keeps plots so predictable and much of the acting and dialog so brainless.OK, I'll admit that I'm coming back to these shows after having been brainwashed by Inspector Morse and Midsommer Murders but hey, I'm sure the Murder She Wrote budget trumped both of these series."
5,Big up to Jessica Fletcher and the Cabot Cove massive,"Being a big fan of murder mysteries, murder she wrote is naturally no exception. Its not just the amazing 80's hair do's, shoulder pads and orange tans that impress me but the fact that Jeesica Fletcher, although just a writer is so much more! She can solve a mystery that not even a New York special decective can and never gets a big head, amazing.If your not swayed to but this video and become a fellow fan then you don't know what your missing, i strongly recommend it.From one sleuth to another, peace out. x"
2,Murder She Wrote Season 1,"The disc set arrived in a very timely manner which was greatly appreciated. However, the first disc had a pretty large scratch on it and could not be viewed on any DVD player...big disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"My DVD's arrived in good condition. The 3 DVD's are marked for a total of 21 episodes. #1 has 3 and #2 has 4. I have not looked at the 3rd one. Needless to say, I do not feel I received my monies worth. There were to be a total of 21 episodes on 3 DVD's. What a ripoff."
2,Will not purchase Double Sided DVD's again...,"I enjoy the initial season of Murder She Wrote very much. My wife and I are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to Who Dun IT. Frequently, though, it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up. Often the audio gets out of synch with the video. Terrible! We surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons, but now -- about 3/4 the way through, I think we'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided DVD's."
1,wasn't really a fan of the dvd,"I bought it just for Paul Mooney, his segment was funny but the rest of the dvd was a waste of time, don't really recommend"
1,BORING FROM START TO FINISH,I USUALLY BUY MOVIES IF IT IS RATED 3 OR MORE STARS BUT THAT'S OUT THE QUESTION FROM NOW ON. I TOOK THIS MOVIE OUT BEFORE IT STARTED PLAYING GOOD. IT IS STUPID AND I'M SORRY I WASTED THE TIME BUYING IT
1,relaxing,"i found the contents of this book very boring, chapter after chapter was the same. Not much story to it!"
2,I thought I ordered something a little less rapey...,"Beauty is back, and like any 15 year old her love is fickle. The Prince that saved her, who? She is so over Alexi, and out of the blue mad for Tristan. She and Tristan have been sent to the village outside the Castle where servitude is worse and rape and humiliation are even more rampant. The book is about 250 pages and 50 of them are actual story. The other 200 pages are graphic sex scene's of hardcore BDSM. I wish one or two of them were actually be hot and not so rapey. Can someone please explain to me how no one get's pregnant? There are all these healthy teenage girls have unprotected sex and they are being ejaculated inside of. And don't even get me started on STD's? I didn't like this book, but I will see the trilogy through. The first one was ok, maybe the third time is the charm."
3,Good ending!,"I liked this book, but not as much as the first one. The first book still had the 'shock value' and the mystique, but in the second book it wasn't all that shocking and interesting anymore.In the first book we were introduced into the whole sex slave thing; in the second book we got to understand the mindset of the slaves a bit better; and in the third one we got to understand the mindset of the masters as well.It was interesting to read about the male sex scenes, and to read about Laurent's POV.There were subtle clues in this book which suggests that we all have a slave or master in us. I thought that was kind of interesting. The ending was good too. I liked that they all got what they wanted in the end."
3,Not for the weak of heart.,"This book is, to say the least, racy. It's an interesting story line, but very, very, graphic. If you're in the least bit prude, do not purchase this."
2,Over And Over,"I normally love detail in a book. This whole series was so repetitious that I didn't finish it. I didn't care about the characters enough to even find out about the ""happily ever after""."
3,Finally,This was not one of Anne Rice's best. I read this book because I was curious to find out what happened next. But it was pretty much the same thing as the previous book just a different back drop. I don't know what I expected but this wasn't it.
5,Beautifully written.,"In the final volume of Anne Rice's deliciously tantalizing erotic trilogy, Beauty's adventures on the dark side of sexuality make her the bound captive of an Eastern Sultan and a prisoner in the exotic confines of the harem. In Beauty's Release, Anne Rice makes the forbidden side of passion a doorway into the hidden regions of the psyche and the heart."
1,Not a love Story!!,"Okay, the whole Sleeping Beauty Trilogy was just not for me. There was nothing loving about it. I thought it was all just degrading and humiliating."
4,beauty release,The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends and I will continue reading her books
3,Not Movie Material!!,"Reading for very open minded people!!! I'm sure by most people this would be considered ""racy....very racy""!! Not a book to leave laying around if you have children who can read!"
4,"Beauty's Release is truly Wonderful, Raunchy, and RAW !!!","Anne Rice, under the name A.N. Roquelaure, completes the third and final book of her erotic Sleeping Beauty series in this elegantly written book entitled Beauty's Release.This book drips with sexuality and only the boldest readers of an adult nature should dare even to glance at its cover !The story itself deals with topics of love, lust, and the balances and conflicts of dominance/submission.Like never before, this book destroys all social norms dealing with sexuality and at times will cause even the boldest of readers to experience rapid heart palpitations of steamy desire.Beauty's Release, as the rest of the erotic Sleeping Beauty adventure series, is truly a masterpiece in its own right"
3,"New to this genre, so take this review with a grain of salt...","This was my first foray into this genre, so I had no specific expectations. Unfortunately, I found this whole series disappointing. The 2nd & 3rd books are better than the first one, but the erotic action in all three books is really repetitive and therefore became boring fairly quickly. I kept waiting for the story lines to take off or intermingle in some interesting way, but they just never did."
4,Compelling Conclusion to Exquisite Erotic Fairy Tale,"This is the last of the beauty series, though definitely not any less in excitement or erotic thrills.Once again, Anne Rice takes the reader on a sensual tour of sexual fantasy, which leaves them gasping for air. The story remains intriguing until the very end, daring you to put down the book before you find your own satisfaction.True to form, this is well-written, exciting, and just generally good fiction! It is, however, written for the over eighteen crowd as its sex scenes are VERY graphic in nature."
3,"The book is much, much better!","This audio is very abridged. Many key scenes were left out. The section where Laurent tells Beauty about serving Lady Elveria is completely left out, and Lexius is left in the garden when Tristan and Laurent are taken to the ship by Nicholas and the Captian."
2,Almost but not quite,"Anne Rice, almost, but not quite captured something with her unique idea. Her new approach to the story was different and intriguing but fell flat with the lack of character, creativity and common sense. It would have been a wonderful read. I would have expected more from Anne Rice."
3,good enough,"Laurent's adventures are far more exciting here than are Beauty's. Laurent undergoes some pretty humiliating trials, like when he is made to walk in a squat, while his arms are bound behind his back onto a phallus. I also like it when he and Tristan have to become ""ponies""--even having to wear long bushy tails on their bottoms, and being spanked as they pull heavy loads."
2,Beauty and Eros,While I enjoy Ann Rice's many books this one tends to become tiresome. It tends to repeat the same scenes over and over with little to no depth of imagination. This book becomes unbearably redundant.
3,"The occasional pinky finger suits me just fine, thank you.","Every time this book started to get me going it lost me by sticking some unrealistically massive object up another characters hiney hole. This resulted in any erotic thoughts I might have had turning into, ""Wow, I bet that hurt"" or ""This guy must have a hole the size of a cave to enjoy that"". Bigger may be better, but sooner or later the law of diminishing returns kicks in."
3,Interesting,"I remain intrigued by Rice's ability to sustain Beauty's journey over a modern series. I found myself skipping the sex to get back to the plot, as with the other books in this series, which made it a pretty short read. I respect Rice's direction with the series, but specifically with this book, in that Beauty walked the gamut of her desire, literally bottom to top. Her conclusion is a very honest one. Needless to say, this series opened mainstream erotica, specifically in the genre of BDSM, for good."
1,Horrible,"I would give this zero stars if I could. I love most of Ms. Rice's books, and I also like reading erotica. But the trilogy was a effort to slog through, I only bought books 2 and 3 after completing the first one because I wondered what would happen to Beauty. It's nothing but degradation and humiliation for a character we don't even really know (What was Beauty like before she was struck by the curse?) And I was disappointed with what happened to Beauty. The ending was rather cliched and depressing, and the entire trilogy is just one big spankfest that according to the books are supposed to be for the good of these poor teenagers (some of who could apparently end up as slaves indefinitely, like poor Prince Roger). If you want better erotica, go for a true classic, like the works of Anais Nin."
5,Beauty's Release,"#3 in the series. A great read, made you wish there were more books in this series. If you have read 50 Shades, then this series is a must!"
2,Bad Beauty Bad,"If you loved 50 shades, you'll love...this series not so much. There is no love or romance in this series. It's about princes and princesses, most of them underaged, being beaten and raped on a daily basis. One of the minor characters is 16 and in his last year of service, so when did he start? At 12, 13?? Miss Rice, have you ever considered therapy for your preoccupation with pedophilia? It was evident in the vampire series and just explodes in this series. Pretty sick sis."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"It is Anne Rice, so the attention to detail is exquisite. However, the storyline failed to grasp my complete attention. I fail to catch the appeal of a castle full of naked slaves....."
4,Erotica Plus,"The third of the trilogy, these are really interchangeable novels with different settings. The story does have a lot of variations with reference to masters but how many times can poor Beauty and Laurent undergo these trials of the heart andn body?We are in mysterious Arabia, with jewels, exotic foods (ha ha), a retinue of slaves and rituals. Then on to the horse races with the human horses - almost a hilarious concept if you think about it. Rice does well, though, in exploring the depths of the soul and how it is consumed by the feverish, steamy situations and people they inevitably encounter."
3,Beauty's Release,"A disappointing end to a trilogy of books. I would recommend it for a person who has read the previous two because you will want closure. But, I expected more pazzaz for an ending. It also does not go as fast as the first two. Has some parts that seem to be just thrown in to make the book longer."
2,TOO FAR GONE!!,"I'm about 3/4 the way through and I have to say..not so good. It's too much. I wasn't sure there could be a too much, but this is it. I don't want to hear about young boys fondleing and flogging men..the world is too full of grown men wishing for things that aren't real and can't be real. Some things are better left to the individuals imagination. I'm not sure why these things turn this woman on and I frankly don't want to wonder those things when I'm reading a book for the type of pleasure I'm seeking. I'm sure you'll see what I mean a few chapters into it. I like all this kind of ""stuff""..but this, I didn't like. You'll see"
2,"Why, oh, why did I purchase this series?","Although, book three did find the main characters in new locales, Rice really missed an opportunity for Beauty to take a lead role in her personal development and face the issues of female mutilation that she was introduced to with a harem lover. Unfortantly, this storyline was sacrificed in order to end the book. Ms. Rice's abilities to provide period & emotional detail has and what continues to draw me to her writing. What could have been a magnificant retelling of a classic fairytale became a three book snooze fest. I was sadly disappointed in this series."
1,Disgusting & disturbing. Rape!!!!!!!,Nothing like 50 shades. What a disgusting story. Everything about was just awful. Actually made me sick. Very disturbing. I'm not sure who thought it was like 50 shades but it most certainly was not. No where in 50 Shades does it go into rape.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The third installment in Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy is more of the same. The device here is that a group of the slavelings are taken to an Arabian style harem setting and used there, in much the same way as they were used in the previous book.Unsurprisingly, they like quite a bit of it. At the end, Beauty has to decide who she will settle down with."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I loved how the how all the books kept you up on the events and actions of each individual. And it was very interesting how Beauty changed to love her captures..The ending was a little disappointing, but the overall storyline was great."
2,ESLTeacher,"The Cambridge ""In Use"" series is a favorite of mine; however, this book is too British English specific. I wouldn't recommend it for use in North America."
4,Great Audio Read too,Very nice to find a new author that we will look forward to reading. The reader on the audio CD Paul Michael did a great job as well.
5,Wow.,"Speak of the Devil is a kick in the pants, TNT loaded read from start to finish. Richard Hawkes debut novel is a sure fire hit and if it doesn't end up on a best seller list ""we was robbed.""Fritz Malone steps out on Thanksgiving morning to get some breakfast and slowly meanders to the parade location. Enjoying the sights and sounds he spots a sniper about to open up on the parade and shouts a warning. The dead and dying mount up as the sniper does his worst. Eventually Malone is tossed unceremoniously into a police car and whisked away to police headquarters. He is released and begins solving the case of his life. Without giving too much away, I will say that the read was a stupendous one.Hawke's debut novel is a fantastic roller coaster of a ride. Believeable plot, plenty of twists and turns, great dialog, and wonderful characters....Speak of the Devil has it all.I highly recommend this book"
5,Couldn't put it down.,I am always thrilled when I discover a new author whose story line and unique writing style keeps me turning pages.
4,Highly enjoyable,"This was a different type of novel for me, but I enjoyed the fast pace and complex characters. Couple of holes in the story, but I could see a 2nd series novel come out to connect the dots. Also, I disagree with other post, this is not a typical tough guy PI. Do yourself a favor and read this funny, sarcastic and smart book. I look forward to ready more from this author."
2,how disappointing!,"I really wanted to like this book, but I was very disappointed. While the main character seemed likable enough, the book was far too Spenserish - big, tough wise-cracking yet sensitive PI, colorful sidekick, intellectual girl-friend. The plot was (literally) unbelievable, with a messy ending that made no sense. The book could have benefited from a better editor, who could have pointed out the obvious police procedural errors and who could have pointed out to the author that he really, really, really, needed to come up with a better ending."
2,Too complex to believe,"The story falls apart. Early on, too many unusual circumstances signal where the bad guys are. Too long, too many coincidences.Maybe next time."
4,Generally impressed,"I understand this to be Mr. Hawke's first novel. As such, I found it a good first effort. It reminded me of works by both Michael Connelly and Nelson DeMille in the style and in the personality of the main character. The main negative for me was that the author would often put the main charater in situations that called for intelligent responses and inevitably his choice would be dictated by his macho persona, resulting in predictable chaos. I guess I just prefer my heros to be more intelligent - manly, but not an airhead. I hope Mr. Hawke can improve on this aspect in his sequel."
2,Kind of boring,Ok......first of all I got this toy last Christmas ('07) for FREEEEEE when I purchased another toy from Amazon. It was some sort of promotion that they were having. I see it's selling for [...] right now. C~R~A~Z~Y!!! You wouldn seriosly have to be out of your MIND to buy this toy for that amount of money. It was played with for about 10 minutes in the last year. They are just bored with it. (my 4 and 5 year olds). It's fairly durable if you want to count the endless times it's been thrown in and out of the toybox. :)
2,Don't Bother,"Had I not read any other Sandra Heath books I would say give this author a miss. However, this is a first novel (or a rewrite of one) and, unlike her later work, there are problems. The plot idea is a good one but there are abrupt transitions, some underdeveloped characters, and some behaviour inappropriate to the regency period. On the other hand, I have read much worse elsehwere and her later works are very good reads. Don't be put off Sandra Heath but don't bother with this book."
3,For Camus Enthusiasts Only,"A Happy Death is Camus' first novel - that's obvious from the start. Having previously read The Stranger and The Fall, I guess I was spoiled. I didn't really appreciate A Happy Death. It was a brooding, hedonistic tale laced with the same moral dilemmas as The Stranger and The Fall yet it lacked the beauty of both. The value in this novel, however, is that, in combination with his other works, it shows the development of a very talented writer. Do I recommend it? Only for those who've read everything else by Camus and have a bit of patience."
2,A mixed bag.,"Although it contains some passages of sublime and sensuous description,Camus's early blueprint of ""The Outsider"" generally misfires,due to dramatic weaknesses,over-formal plotting and thin characterisation.A tedious and unmemorable work that ranks far below ""The Outsider"",""The Rebel""and ""The Myth of Sisyphus."""
3,Read his other works first.,"If you haven't read Camus yet, read ""The Stranger"" or one of his other works. ""Happy Death"" does not really hold its own as well as a stand-alone novel; and The Stranger is a much better read. However, ""Happy Death"" does provide some keen insight into Camus and his philosophy and is worth reading for that reason alone as well as for a decent number of really thought provoking powerful passages scattered throughout."
3,Not The best service,not the greatest i never complaint but this was a b-day gift that there was piece missing i wouldn t use again
2,Easily De-furred Bunnies,"I loved these when my daughter first got them for Christmas. They were pretty, their arms, legs, and heads moved, and the little clothes were ""oh so adorable"". Two weeks later they were naked bunnies, and it's not just the fact that my child didn't have the dexterity required to put the clothes back on, she had loved them, and played with them so much the short velveteen type fur had all rubbed off, and they became naked plastic as well. They got dirty easily, the clothing was all lost very quickly, and they became quite ugly. About two months after she received them, my daughter sent the bunny family permanently to the toy tote where they stayed for a very long time without being played with.These would be super for a child around the age of nine, who can get their clothes on and off without mommy help, and will display them more than play with them. They need a child who will not love them to death in as short a time as my six year old did."
2,Not for a beginner,I was required to buy this book for a Computer Science class. Most of my classmates and I really hate it. We had to go elsewhere to really learn how to program in assembly. Brey does not give many good examples. I do not recommend this book for first time assembly language programmers. It might serve as a reference for someone who has previously coded assembly. I hope this helps!
4,Violent Inevitability,"The French Cinema just keeps on producing nervy, fine films. This one kept me guessing; then it had me very rattled, excellent Hithcockian suspense. Emmanuelle Devos subdues her natural good looks to portray a frumpy career girl with hearing problems. However, she can read lips, which gives her an unusual edge, an ease dropping edge.Enter ex-con Vincent Cassel in need of a job to placate his parole officer. Sure, she needs a office partner to help take revenge on rotten fellow employees, but also there's a man shortage in her life. Cassel's prison tattoos and hard knock face is an attractive counterpoint for Devos' sexless life.There are very tense scenes at the end of the film, which reminded me of Tarrentino's script, True Romance. It is difficult to say why sex in France is different than sex handled by American directors, even Tarentino, but there's a violent inevitability about French love scenes that make Hollywood seem puritanical."
3,Life Source Easy-Fit BP Monitor,"The reason I rated this at ""3"" is because of the easy-fit cuff. It's not that easy...it has a piece of curved plastic built into it to make it easier to wrap around your arm, I guess. However, I find it more difficult. I have the regular fit cuff that comes with the package, which is normally the size I use. But the built-in plastic piece does not bend that easily, so getting the cuff to wrap and secure is a little more difficult/requires more patience. I would think people with arthritus in their hands/fingers would find this even more of a problem."
2,Inaccurate readings.,This cuff was very inaccurate as far as my BP readings were concerned. It always read me at least 20 points higher than I was. I went to the doctor to see if the readings were accurate and they were very far from accurate and the doctors readings were consistently very different from this BP cuff.
5,Life Source Blood Pressure Monitor,"Best BP monitor ever. Fast, accurate BP & Pulse, informative and easy to use. Love the 60 reading averages it gives. Quality instrument.LifeSource UA-787EJ Quick Response Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor with Easy-Fit Cuff, Pressure Rating Indicator and AC Adapter"
5,Great & Easy to Use,"I have had the LifeSource UA-787EJ for about a month now and I think it's easy to use, easy to read and accurate. The cuff is comfortable and yet loose enough for that 2 finger comfort. It only takes less than a minute to complete the entire process. I would deffinately recommend this monitor to everyone!"
3,Works as promised,"So far as I can tell, the monitor works correctly. It's easier to get a reading than with the older model it replaced."
2,Life source UA-787E Blood pressure cuff,The cuff that was supplied with this bp meter is to big for my wife and lacks flexibility that's makes it hard to use. We are disappointed with this product!
1,It's the worst device I got online,I searched through sites to get a good BP measurement and a lot of sites recommend it but it keeps give me a wrong readings (110/70) while my real BP is 140/90
1,Accurate... for awhile.,"The LifeSource UA-787EJ read accurately for a few months as tested against my Omron wrist cuff and the doctor's office, but now reads consistently high (sometimes even by over 30 points). After one reading of 161/119, I called my Cardiologist who told me to meet him immediately at the emergency room (where my blood pressure read as ~130/80). I've tested it several times now against the Omron and took it to the doctor, where it now reads at least 10 points high for both numbers.Since it I can't use it anymore to reliably test my blood pressure, it gets one star."
3,Easy to use but only lasted 5 years,"We purchased this unit about 5 years ago. We got it based on reviews as it being #1. It worked great for the first 4 1/2 year. We noticed my husband's BP was creeping up higher and higher. Finally we began to panic and visited the doctor. Everytime he went to the dr, it was normal. But when we used the LifeSource, it was high again. It began to dawn on us that the unit was failing. Is that reasonable, to expect something to last more than a few years? It must be placed correctly on the upper arm and you can get a higher reading. Takes about 30 seconds. An annoying feature - Sometimes it is so tight while reading the BP, then it pumps up even MORE and you feel like your arm is about to explode! Technology has improved to the point that I would no longer recommend this product. It's bulky and not easy to travel."
3,Small Cuff,Even though my arm measurement fell within the range of the EZ Cuff it was too small. Now I have to order a large cuff or return this monitor and buy one with a large cuff.DM
2,5 weeks Delivery?,I placed this order on 20-Aug-2010. It arrived on 30-Sep-20. It wasn't back ordered when I bought it. The carrier says they delivered it to my house on 25-Aug-2010. But not really... it arrived more than 5 weeks later on 30-Sept. Where was it all that time?
5,Great product,"This is a very product. It is very accurate, easy to use and I purchased it at a reasonable price."
3,S-L-O-W,"This cuff is satisfactory. It is reasonably precise. I bought it because I wanted a cuff that was fast. This one is not particularly fast, in fact it might be a bit slower than average for a consumer-grade machine."
2,I returned,I think the product was probably okay. I just couldn't get the cuff on correctly to get a correct reading. Guess I will leave this to my doctor.
2,Cuff too big for women,"I was able to fit the cuff on my arm, but my mother (for whom it was purchased) was not able to get the cuff to fit hers. Only with me struggling to get the cuff on her did we ever get this unit to take a close-to-proper reading of her BP. She is completely unable to get the cuff on by herself with one hand. In short, the ""Easy-fit"" cuff isn't. I strongly advise women to avoid this product. (If you look at all the reviews, you'll see the 5-star raters are all men; they're the only ones who could get the cuff to fit.)"
4,Very Informative,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It was required for a class on the history of childhood and was very interesting. There is a lot of information laid out very quickly. Maybe too much information! I feel like in any other case this book would be divided into two or even three subjects. A very interesting, if overwhelming, read.[...]"
1,library book,"I am concerned that the book was not listed as a library book. Considering that this book is still in print I have to wonder if you sold a library book on amazon without permission. I will alert amazon as well as the Long Beach, Ca. Public Library if I do not receive some clarification from you."
2,Couldn't Get Through It,"I was really excited to read this book. But although the information itself was good, the author's style was just unbearable to me. He repeats himself over and over, which makes the information dry. I bet I could edit it down to half the size and still get all the information in. I tried for almost a year to finish this book, and I just couldn't. It's a shame, because I'm very interested in the subject matter."
5,"Inspirational, Therapeutic","This is the most touching and inspirational movie. The fact that is based on true facts makes it even more powerful.I can't wait to see it produced on DVD. I have being looking for it on DVD for a long time. I am a Psychologist, and MFT and this is a movie that I would recommend to all my patients to see. ""I believe that it does not matter what life brings us, it is up to us to overcome adversity. We have the freedom in our will to choose not to be miserable by being in the presence of the absence, and to do the best of what we have.""Dr. Estella Sneider, Ph.D.AKA: Dra. CorazonLos Angeles"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,Not at all user friendly. Job categories are VERY limited and do not include several major categories in today's market!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!!!
5,Great Train Journeys,"The theatrical review is dead on, beautiful footage by people who know what they are doing and looks like they love trains. Good for educating young people in what was and in many places the main way in many people get from place to place. A look at the some Worlds great railways that are still operating as passenger service. Enjoy. (this is not past history, it is present (2000's) time. New film 2006."
4,Good Book for Reference,"This is a good book for reference. I use minitab at work and this has proved useful, better than Rath & Strong's ""Guide to Minitab"" which I also have."
3,OK for introductory Level Info,"The book doesn't leave the basic info. out.For those individuals who are familar with PC or window's basic functions, the introductory pages may be tedious and annoying.It's an OK book for an introductory level material."
3,A bit tough to understand for those without some experience.,"I bought this book for use in my statistics course and while it's helped a couple times, it's really not made a giant difference. I think a big part of the reason is that I don't have much experience with Minitab or computer language, so understanding the ""why"" of some of the steps is difficult. I'm glad that I have it and the few times it's helped me I've been grateful for it, but on the whole I'm not sure it'll make a big difference in improving my understanding of Minitab (no more so than just reading through the ""Help"" section in the program itself)."
2,Disappointing,This can't be called a handbook. It is not detailed enough. It should be called Minitab for beginner.
4,An underappreciated gem &#65533; with a perennial message!,"This work really deserves 3.5-4 stars, not just the meager 3 awarded it by the respected Martin & Porter. It is one of the better, more humanly and socially interesting, and philosophically more important of the 83 films in which Stewart acted, although its aeronautical engineering focus, and British understatement or civility, must understandably account for its neglect by the public and presumably by critics. Stewart's acting style or personality in this film was unusual even for him, or in the extreme to which it took one of his many canonical roles and manners, say that of a charming eccentric (but who in this case is also a brilliant scientist). The film is ultimately a celebration of conscience and integrity, differentiated from what at first appears to be merely idiosyncrasy or dangerous insanity."
3,A Must See for Engineers,"The original Dilbert story. If you've ever struggled with management to take your engineering analysis seriously, this is the film for you. Hollywood doesn't make too many films about engineers, so I found a lot of humor in this one. Loved the dialog about how an actress' life was more valuable than an engineer's because they make more people happy. The design of the airplane was funny in itself. One of my favorite scenes was Stewart watching the clock at the moment the tails was supposed to fall off and in the background you could see workers walking around underneath the tail. Guess they didn't have a safety department back then. And talk about famous last words in movies. Its hard to beat ""I should have run the test at 40 degrees cooler.""Okay, so its not Gone With the Wind or Casablanca, but you might want to rent it for your next engineering party."
4,Like a strange dream,"This movie is the kind where you feel like you could wake up and say, man, what a weird dream. Marlene Dietrich is great in this film; I guess her appearance was in part to revive her career. Not sure if it succeeded, but she is at her world-weary, luxuriously dominating best. I wouldn't call this James Stewart's best movie by a long shot, but he still delivers an enjoyably naive performance. And it does get tense, in a 50s worshipful techno-engineering sort of way. Some good character actors involved as well."
5,No Highway in the Sky,Neveille Shute is a wonderful British fiction writer. While the actual book is very much better then the movie the film offers a very exciting story.
5,Amazing value,"Who would have thought you could get a real-life laser printer for so little money? When I first saw this item on sale, I thought the price was a mistake. When I bought it, I half expected it to be too good to be true. Instead, I found myself with a printing workhorse. I share it on a network with two coworkers. It was easy to set up on our network, prints great quality text and images, and is reasonably fast. This printer exceeds the quality of a laser printer I purchased several years ago for over three times as much. Unless you have need of color printing, or have 20+ users sharing the printer, I can't see any reason not to get this gem."
2,2000 reasons not to buy this printer!,"While I'm certain this is a good printer-- Be warned there are no drivers, beta or otherwise for this printer available from Xerox that will function under Windows 2000. With the release of the OS just weeks away! Also when asked when they might have a driver for this printer under 2000 I was told, ""I dunno. If we DO write a driver for it, I wouldn't expect it until after April."" Granted there are some Xerox laser drivers that come standard with Windows 2000- this isn't one of them. For me anyway it was a big issue, so I returned it and bought the HP Laserjet 1100 (there is already a standard driver in 2000 for the HP printer)I was truly surprised to find a company like Xerox so behind the curve in the technology market."
3,It's good for home use but Not 5 * good,"I have owned a p8 for 6 months and put 3000 + pages monthly through it. If all you ever do is print single sided then this is a bargain for a printer. Try printing on paper that has already been through the printer and it noticably smudges the paper when doing this.It also misfed constantly. ( due to the curl caused by printer) This occured using many kinds of paper.Supplies are a little on the expensive side, a drum and toner costing over the the price of the whole unit. Driver setup was quick with no major problems,good instructions( from previous experience good tech support )Again this is non typical use, I was given the printer to try and would not argue that it would admirably be able to handle a life of homework and home finance for 2 years without hassle."
2,Gravy Boat and Warming Stand,Design is cool. Looks good. But metal work is so lightweight that I am worried it will bend if I put anything in it.
2,Why not a real digital system like Diamonds MP3 player,"If your not an internet user your proberly beter of with a minidisk system, but if you are on the net order a protable MP3 player by Diamond or Philips, i own one with 64mb, thats not a lot but it does the job!"
5,Useful learning,"This book contains accurate information served up in a series of fun activities for kids. Those few who were offended by it are obviously off the beam. The authors state that St. Joan heard voices - well, folks, that's the way it reads in universdity level books as well. Don't believe the naysayers - this is a great books for parents and kids who like to have fun learning."
4,Great Resource for Teachers,"This is a great resource for teachers and homeschoolers. Obviously by reading other reviews you can see some of the issues that have cropped up with this book for others. What I liked about it is that it covered a wide range of activities that would help children learn about medieval times and knights and castles. Knights and castles are fun to learn about and young children enjoy learning about knights, castles, kings and princesses. This book has a lot of ideas of things children can make and do to help them envision this age in history. We enjoyed doing many of the activities out of this book.Enjoy."
3,Knights & Castles - what a great book!,"We are studying the Medieval period; this book has been invaluable with lots of great reading, wonderful ideas and awesome crafts!! Well worth the money and enjoyed by both Mom and child!Thanks!Dayle Rewa"
1,Read the all reviews first!,"I was really disappointed by this book. It's very anti-Christian, anti-European, anti-Middle Ages, even. Avery Hart is warping history to suit a politicly correct agenda. I hoped to at least get a few craft ideas, but those were unoriginal and not well done. The ""make your own code of honor"" craft for example didn't even give an example of what a medieval code of honor might have been like. The book, in my opinion at least, is a big waste."
2,An Anti-Church Guide to the Middle Ages,"This book has many interesting arts & craft ideas which kids find fun. However, one must endure numerous unsympathetic interpretations of the times which present the Church and Christians in general as ignorant and superstitious people. For example, the book states that Joan of Ark ""heard voices in her head that helped her do battle and led her to victory."" Such a statement would lead one to believe that she was really schizophrenic and not a saint of the Church. There are simply too many examples of this kind of smug, retrospective arrogance towards Christians of the past to list in this review. In every chapter, Christians are painted as stupid, blood thirsty, narrow-minded, etc. Their anti-Church bias is just too blatant to overlook.One would be better off checking out Martha Stewart's kid magazine for craft ideas and pick up a less biased history book to read to children. Any Christian educator will want to avoid this book."
2,There are better choices.,I found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities. Spend your money on Days of Knights and Damsels by Carlson.
2,"Disappointing, have loved their other books","As mentioned in other reviews, the writing is very biased and above the head of most grade school students. I don't take issue with discussing the problems of any given era (church or not), but the approach is very slanted and complex for it's targeted audience. The tone is pervasively negative, which is an odd thing to say considering this book addresses the dark ages... but it's distinctly odd for a children's book. I was also disappointed in the activity offerings, as I have had such great luck with other books in this series. The ideas were vague, impractical and lacked instructions. Carlson's ""Knights and Damsels"" is much better if you are looking for activities to go along with a unit on the middle ages."
3,Dixiana DVD is a Real Stunner,"Not a classic by any means, the DVD release of DIXIANA allows us to view an early (1930) talkie musical in pristine picture and sound, suggesting how it must of appeared to audiences of that day. Best of all, the last couple of reels have been restored to their original two-strip Technicolor beauty.Bebe Daniela is charming and proves that a silent screen star could effortlessly make the transition to talkies. The male lead is played by Metropolitian Opera star Everett Marshall who displays a fine singing voice but limited acting talent.The real star of this DVD is the stunning picture and sound. The short subject, La Cucharacha, is a nice bonus. While not as sharp as the feature visually, the historic importance of this short compliments DIXIANA nicely. In all, a highly recommended DVD."
1,I LOVE Richard Bach books BUT!!!!!!!,"Yes, I have loved all of Richard Bach books and I truly looked forward to this new one. So I really have only one thing to say. Richard, if you are indeed no longer interested in writing, why trouble yourself with this tiny little story that is over before it starts? What happened?"
1,Complete Waste of time and money!,"I have read all of Bach's books and have never been so disappointed. If you want to read this book, go to the library, find it (because I am sure no one has checked it out), stand there & read it, then put it back on the shelf.Every indication is that he is only after the dollar. His web site proves this. Sad, sad, sad..."
2,"OK, I give, what's with this Richard????","I looked forward to reading ""Out of My Mind"".....I look forward to reading anything by Richard Bach and I have most of his other books, but when I sat down to read this one, I wondered where the rest of the book was? There has to be more to it? Was this just a tease? Chapter 1 of more to come? Richard, what are you doing? Is this part of a strategy? Needless to say, I was left wanting to read the rest of the book. The concept of ""mind travel"" was introduced in ONE. I loved it there, I try to practice it, I love it here..........but this new book seems somewhat out of context....or maybe I just don't know what context it is in??? Need help! Send cookies!!"
5,The book is Richard Bach......................,"in all his glory or lack there-of. I have read the other reviews and I think people need to lighten up. Richard Bach is an author who does not write for the purpose of commercial acceptance or pleasing anyone but himself, he has a story to tell and this just happened to be a very short story. Regardless of the length of the book, it is classic Bach. Better than ONE or BRIDGE, because it is his story , not Leslie's. I rate this book right up there with RUNNING FROM SAFETY. If you truly love Richard Bach as an author, you simply have to read this book and form your own opinion."
1,"Sit down, read it, put it back upon shelf -and now walk away","I've read all his books. In bookstores often checking to see if a new one was born. I almost purchased it right there and walked home, but since I had a few minutes, I read it in that one sitting. Same ideas as his other books, only this time there was not a fun little story, absolutely no life in this re-hash."
1,"Sadly, disappointing","Richard Bach was, for a long time, my favorite author by far. As the years have passed, his books have become more and more predictable, and less and less enthralling. I read Saunders Vixen in one sitting, and promptly returned it to the bookstore. There was nothing of real value in the book, just a dull story of an alternate universe. Sadly, the same old thing."
5,great for us pilots,"I just read Out Of My Mind and I loved it. Yes,it was short but since the person who had sparked his journey to Saunders-Vixen was about to go somewhere else I thought it was the natural spot to end.Following her would be another story as would returning to Saunders-Vixen without her. Perhaps Im prejudiced since I love vintage aircraft and often imagine myself in another place and time to enjoy what once was but thats why I read books.To escape to somewhere Ive never been before. So if yould like a short but beautifully written fantasy to take you away to a world of vintage planes,no war,and friendly people,I say read this book. Ive got to go to sleep under my Fokker D-7 model now and if I can relax enough just maybe.........."
3,non stick doesn't stick,At this point in the life span of non stick cookware I thought all non stick cooking surface material would stay on the pan. I was very surprised after only a couple of months of sporadic use to see a nick in the material of the small fry pan. I dug at it a bit with my fingernail and it continued to peel right off the pan. It is too bad because the pans look nice and work nicely. (the rest of the pans are holding up but have not even had as much use as the small fry pan.
1,NOT dishwasher safe!,"I ordered this item in July of 2010 and by September 2010 these pots and pans had already been discolored by my dishwasher. I now have three original red pans, and the rest have turned black from the heat of my dishwasher. The lids also don't completely cover the pan so when I make something like popcorn on the stovetop, hot oil spews out of the sides of the lid and gets all over my stove. I've also gotten a few grease burns from this.Overall, I wouldn't order this product. My $20 set from target lasted almost 5 years and after a little over a year, I already want to replace this $80 set. I'd much rather have bought 4 sets from target than spend the money on this crap.Though I will say, the three utensils you get with it are quite nice. Most expensive spoons I've ever bought though!"
1,Not the advertised product!,I bought this pan set thinking this was a Farberware product. However it is as Silverware one! Though the pans looks nice the teflon is not as good as Farberware. This one star goes to Amazon.com that announces it wrongly.
1,Nice Bag - Lousy shoulder strap hardware,"Although this bag is fairly lightweight by itself, has several different size carrying compartments to accommodate a wide range of computer pats and accessories and will accommodate a 15-16"" laptop [diagonal], the design of the hardware to attach the strap to the bag is faulty. I have been using this bag for about 2 weeks and already the strap snap catch hardware has jammed onto the metal loop permanently affixed to the bag. The first time I was able to free the snap catch but the second time it was so securely jammed that the catch had to be destroyed in order to remove the strap. I would not recommend purchasing this or any other Targus bag with a similar strap mechanism until Targus redesigns the hardware to make it jam-resistant."
3,Not as Good as I'd hoped,This bag carries the laptop just fine but lacks useful storage for other 'stuff'.Used it on a business trip to the UK last week and won't do that again. I'll buy a roller case for the lap top instead.
5,Book- garden design,This is a beautifully illustrated book with pictures and diagrams of courtyards and all that go with them on every page. There are plant suggestions and ideas for various theme courtyards. I can't think of a design or theme that is missing from this book- there truly is something for every courtyard lover. A great idea book.
4,"Retold for the young, but good for all.","When I say this book was retold/written for the young, that is based on its cover and I guess maybe a bit on its approach. This is not hard core academia, this is a way to gather the majority of the stories from some major sagas in a pleasing form. This is much needed because the sagas themselves tend to be just chapters of a greater story, this book tries to put their tales in a storyline. Near the end of the book it gets a bit more into the theological and discusses (traditional thoughts on) the afterlife in detail. It is quite good and well worth having in your collection. Both for entertainment and understanding of traditional northern European beliefs and attitudes."
4,"Not as bright, still good.","Last Christmas, I got a two-cell Maglite flashlight - the new LED model. It's very bright and way more energy-efficient than the old incandescent models I already owned. I hate to waste a well-made flashlight, still in good condition, but wanted to save batteries and gain the other advantages of the LED models, so I ordered this LED conversion even though it was as expensive as a whole new flashlight. It's simplicity itself to install and works well (so far -- I've only had it about a month). It doesn't match the extreme brightness of the LED flashlight that I got as a gift but approximately matches the incandescent model with fresh batteries. I like it. I'd have felt guilty throwing away such a beautiful hunk of polished, anodized aluminum; it probably would have languished in a drawer or closet for the next century or so."
3,Don't buy unless you get a great price,"You can get a new complete second generation LED Maglite for around $25. So it make's no sense to pay $20 for a first generation upgrade module. If you can pickup an upgrade module for cheap, though, by all means do so. These upgrade modules were designed as a drop-in replacement for the incandescent bulbs in standard Maglites. The second generation lights have been retooled specifically for LEDs, however, and have better performance: (1)They have an improved LED. (2)The reflector bowl has been redesigned. (3)Heat sinking has been improved. The LED is not replaceable in the second generation Maglites."
5,"Spend the money, you'll love it","With 2 2 D cell Maglites I needed some replacement bulbs and wanted to add the Xenons. In the past I haven't been happy with any LED flashlight I've found. UNTIL NOW. After reading the reviews I decided to try one of these, and get the xenons as well. Side by side, the Xenons don't hold a candle to this. The light is white, not yellowish like the Xenons. This thing is amazing. Now I have to figure out what to do with all these Xenon bulbs."
2,Works very well,Very good illumination and very good battery life. I'll never buy another flashlight with an incandescent bulb--only these high-output LEDs.I unintentionally gave this item two stars when I meant to give it four.
3,unbelevable,I can't get ovrt the light this puts out what a differance I thought my other LEDs were bright but this thing kicks it
5,Does what it says in a tiny package,"I bought this due to my computer having a secuirty setting that automatically locks the screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, which causes any running apps via VPN to log me out or as away. As I work from home with no little children I don't see the reason for concern, and auto logging off causes issues if I'm on a call/meeting and walk away from my computer. I was worried that the dongle would be huge and my existing security settings would reject the device, but it's great! Package was super easy to open (no plastic clam shell from hell!) and I just popped the tiny device in the USB. A small light flashes when it's ""jiggling"" and works as described, no security/permission issues. Highly recommend if you're in my boat."
5,Works as Advertized,It stops your pc from hibernating without disrupting your work. This product is really only beneficial to those in a situation such as someone that uses a work pc that has security settings that causes the user to have to log on again after 5 minutes of inactivity on the pc. For this application it work great. No software to install. You just need a spare USB port.
3,Unnecessary hardware for most-- free software solutions exist,"Unless you are in a work situation that is so tightly regulated that you cannot install any programs on your computer this hardware is unnecessary. There are many freeware solutions that will do the same thing (just google ""freeware mouse jiggler""). The only people that need a hardware solution to prevent screensavers (or security programs, in my case) from shutting you down mid-task are those who do not have adequate permissions to install programs on their computers. For them this product will work fine. Around my office we're all using software solutions to get around the annoying forced logouts of a new software package."
5,It's made my work life so much easier,"This tiny little device worked from the first moment I merely stuck it in the port. I notice no difference in the use of my mouse, but a big difference in that my frustration at constantly being kicked out of the system and having to log in 100 times per shift is totally gone. Since no one else can EVER see my computer based on its location, I don't think that using this poses any security risk at all, and it's made my work life so much easier. Try one...you'll like it. But if it's for work, don't get caught!"
4,Saves time,"If your work computer is set to disconnect when not in use and you can't change it, this is a good solution. If I worked in some classied job then I might understand IT being so paranoid, but I don't and the constant logging off is just annoying."
1,Doesn't seem to work on Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.x,"I read the system requirements and saw that it does support Macs as well as PCs. I purchased the Fast Mouse Jigglier and that thing works like a charm but for something more stealthy like this slow one, it doesn't seem to work on all 4 of my Mac computers running Mountain Lion and Mountain Lion server.... :/"
5,Great product. Works as advertised.,Great product. Works as advertised. When I run a long update operation and points my browser to our backyard raccoon cam I just stick this in instead of mucking with the screen timeout settings. I am using the slow version of Mouse Jiggler and never notice any interference with the mouse.
4,Works well,"Works pretty well and was about $15 cheaper than a less-brand item at the box store. I use it on 1/2"" plywood and sometimes have to do a little sanding afterwards, however much better than my previous no-name bit."
4,"Decent book, excellent writers, neat perspective","Plot twists actually worked. I don't often get surprised, but some parts of this book actually managed that. Mostly, it's very predictable, but the bird's funny, the plot keeps moving, and the characters are likable if not totally endearing.The Thoenes haven't won all those writing awards for no reason. I don't think this is their best series, but it's all right."
5,This is a gem...,"I've used this book for a beginning-of-the-school-year story for many years now, and always find that my students are charmed by Tim's offbeat characterizations. There's a message here, no doubt about it; but it is presented in a gentle, humorous manner, and doesn't ever descend into the treacly sentiments that can be found in some children's books. As so many fine authors do, Tim Egan writes for children AND adults. There is no dumbing-down here. It's always hard to tell who enjoys this story more -- my students or me. If you want a subtle, yet pointed, story about Waging Peace and Cooperation, give this a shot. (And then try ""Friday Night at Hodges' Cafe"", if you haven't already.) And don't forget to check out his illustrations closely; you'll find names of his wife & sons, as well some fun details that add to the enjoyment."
5,Roxanne Rustand has written another winner!,You'll love this heartwarming tale about a disillusioned lawyer who falls for a quirky house-sitter with a troubled daughter and a dark past. The author paints a compelling picture of two lonely souls thrown together by circumstance who overcome seemingly insurmountable problems to forge strong family bonds and a love to last a lifetime. Love the humor provided by the disruptive menagerie that serves as 'chaperone'. A very moving and uplifting book. Don't miss this one!
3,Software Safety,"This is an OK book that should have been an excellent book. Frankly, it was a big disappointment. The author is the grand poo-bah of software safety, and so I expected the book to be deep and profound. Instead it is rather shallow with lots of generalities. A lot of what is said is the type of common sense discussion that I would expect from a social scientist, rather than a scientist. I was particularly surprised to see but one page on independent verification and validation. This is a very important topic for ensuring software safety, yet one evidently not on Professor Leveson's radar screen."
1,Worthless,"It is made of hard plastic that is not fun to catch - most peopledive out of the way when it comes in! Also, it rarely opens up intoa ball. When it does open up, it is just a bigger piece of hard plastic(with fairly sharp edges) coming at at your head."
1,not fun,"My 8 year old daughter begged for this for her birthday. She got the red and yellow colored one. It flattens because there are 2 suctions cups on the inside of the foam ball. When the suction cups got dirt on them it wouldnt stay flat very long, it popped up before you could throw it. When we wiped the suction cups off with just our fingers it stayed stuck flat for too long, we could throw this thing from one end of our property to the other and when it hit the ground it still stayed flat. If it pops up to a ball form while in your hand your fingers get pinched in the ball. IT didnt bother my adult fingers too much but my daughter has cried many times from getting her fingers pinched. She hates this toy. It really isnt that much fun. If you play hot potato with it whoever gets the ball when it pops WILL get pinched fingers. I dont recommemd it for younger kids and older kids probably wont find it much fun."
5,Sco in a more jazzy setting,"Whoever says that the tunes on this CD are... and I quote ""atrocious"" probably can't play jazz and don't realize how nice this quartet works together. I'll admit that some of the tunes on here were, well, lacking (amsterdam). Dave Hollands playing is quite amazing. He puts the right notes right where they belong. But there is some amazing playing going on here. The last song ""oh, I see"" highlights all of the players strengths. It's great to hear sco play more strait ahead jazz stuff (not to say that I don't love his other stuff! and not to say that this is exactly ""strait ahead""). All of these musicians absolutly tear it up. This is a must for any scofield fan, or any jazz fan for that matter."
2,Sound and fury signifying nothing,"When this was released I rushed out and bought it sound unheard. With those players how could it be other than excellent I reasoned. Now the truth of the matter is that this CD is almost uniformly dreadful. The actual playing technique is obviously first class but the music itself is atrocious. This sort of stuff is the reason why so many listeners have deserted jazz. I defy anyone to hum even a single bar from this collection. Honestly I think it contains one of the worst set of ""tunes"" (and I use the term loosely) released for years. I have a comprehensive jazz collection covering all the bases from ancient to modern but I am quite certain that this CD should never have been released. What were they all thinking? To hear actual music as opposed to this sort of contrived rubbish check out Herbie, Mike Brecker et al from Massey Hall or the Wayne Shorter live set ""Footprints""."
2,Misleading title,"The title is very misleading. This is not really a book of Ghost stories, but rather a book of old fables. They were interesting, but not really what I was expecting when I got the book."
2,Disappointed,"As some of the other reviewers have noted, this title is completely misleading. I purchased this book expecting to read about ghost stories around the area. Instead, the majority of the stories are Cherokee legends and superstitions. Unfortunately, I didn't find them interesting in the least. I feel the money spent was wasted and I was very disappointed and I would have passed on this book if I had known better.I'm giving this 2 stars because the stories that weren't superstitions were interesting."
3,What ghosts?,"Although I somewhat enjoyed this book, I felt that the title was misleading. A more appropriate title would have been simply ""Mountain Folk Tales,"" because many of the narratives were based on ancient Cherokee legends. The book is well written and intelligent, and appears to be historically accurate. In addition, students of Native American culture will find some great material here. However, if you are looking for a good old fashioned haunting, you will not find it in this collection of tales."
4,covenant,"story was well told and characters were realistic with a modern day slant. First time reader of this author, an easy read."
4,The Art of Surviving,"I purchased this book because I was intrigued by the description. How could four now elderly women, albeit Holocaust survivors,possibly rescue a man and a child from their Hamas kidnappers?? They did it by surviving - and prospering. All of them developed power positions in their post Auschwitz lives. And, they understood the value of this power. Additionally, the author presents the very complicated situation in the Middle East in a very unbiased manner. Unfortunately, I left the book on a plane before I finished it. I will buy it again!"
1,Don't Bother!,"Set in Jerusalem, modern fiction - sounded good...but it wasn't. What a disappointing book! I skimmed it just hoping it would get better. What a waste."
3,Gripping suspense novel but real characterization is lacking,"Naomi Ragen's latest novel is a powerful brief against Arab terrorism. That idea forms both its strength and its weakness. The book packs an emotional punch, depicting the horror and the wanton destruction that terrorism has wrought in Israel since the ""second intifada"" began. On the other hand, this book is not fully successful as a novel since nearly all the characters amount to one-dimensional figures, not real people. A British Jewish TV reporter, especially, seems to be the embodiment of the demonization of the media that one encounters all too often among pro-Israel writers. I share their support for Israel but not their palpable anger at the media. Ragen knows how to tell a story, but in several places, this book is just too ""over the top"" to be effective."
5,Reality; with an outlook on terrorism!!!,"This book was page turner! You don't realize what prisoners go through, once they're held hostage; this gives you an idea what may be going on right now--with ""THE WAR ON TERROR""!!!! It makes you think, what all our millitary is going through at this time!!!! And, others that are being held captive........ It definitly keeps you intuned!!!"
2,UNDER PRODUCED,"This one could be a better cd, if the production was better. Has some really good songs. Music Man, Golden Country, Let Me Ride, Like You Do, and So the Story Goes. Kevin's first cd as singer, something the group was in great need of, after their first outing. Rest of the songs are okay, and the cd would get a better scoure, if the production was better, sounds distant and muffled."
5,One of my all-time faves - back when R.E.O. actually rocked,"This is THE R.E.O. album - when they truly rocked. Love every song on the album (oops - ""album"" - showing my age?).So incredibly different and infinitely better than anything they did from 1980 forward. I absolutely CANNOT listen to anything they did after 1980 - pure drivel, compared to REO TWO. (In a similar vein, if you like Sammy Hagar with Van Halan, then check out his superior stint with Montrose - another classic must-have). I challenge anyone to stay still while listening to this CD."
4,Proof that Kevin is THE Reo singer,"This is Kevin Cronins debut with Reo. Every song is strong. ""Flash tan Queen"" is the closest thing to filler but it is very listenable. This cd has energy and quality musicianship. The best tracks are ""Music Man"", ""Like You Do"", and Golden Country,"" All of which deserve massive classic rock airplay. Other songs which are almost as good are ""How the Story Goes"", ""Being Kind..."", and the cover of ""Little Queenie"". This cd has a heavy early seventies sound with great guitar and catchy melodies. Kevins voice sounds strong here, Not syrupy like in Reos much later releases. This has the energy of ""Riding the Storm out"" and the quality and production of REO. If you Like the REO album and ""You Can Tune a Piano...."", this is in the same league, just a touch more raw. GET IT!"
2,"Good fit, but question the quality","Have had the new belt on for a couple of years now, and it will consistently slip and squeal when it is very hot and turn on the ac, which produces more tension on the belt. Have tried to tighten the belt, but continues to slip, but only for a little bit as soon as I start the engine and the ac is already on. When compared to my oem replacement belt, there is definitely not the same amount of rubber as my oem, but do to age, felt like I needed to replace.Product is much cheaper than what I may get at retail locations, but may question where I purchase next time."
1,David Corpsegrinder really needs to get a girlfriend,"yooo!!!#! da almitey corps duz it agan. They releesd AL THEYRE LYVE MATEEREILL! it is sooo BROOOOOOTLE!!!! it is ECKSTREEEEEEEEEEEM!!!???!!?!??Just kidding. Gee whiz, do people really pay money to see these geeks perform their ""hits"" on stage? The world is in sadder shape than I thought. Oh yeah, and let's not forget, this is LIVE, not STUDIO, so the ""songs"" (and I use that term loosely) sound even worse. ""I C** Blood""? Does it get any cornier?You want some good live albums? Check out the Deftones, Sublime, Slayer, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath. They all have live albums out. Seriously, if you like Cannibal Corpse, I recommend Enya and N'Sync.You're probably wondering why I keep writing hate reviews for Cannibal Corpse. And here's the reason: it's fun. Oh yeah, and these guys are a frickin' joke. Nothing less, nothing more.So click ""Not Helpful"" already."
5,I wish I could have been there,"An excellent live album, I had a chance to see Cannibal Corpse once, but unfortunately I didn't have enough money, and since hearing this CD, I really regret not being able to see them. I had my doubts about buying this CD because: 1), there wasn't a parental advisory sticker, and I was worried that this was censored (but I found out that it is not), and 2) I was wondering if the live recording would be good or not. After reading the below reviews, I decided to give the album a chance, and I am glad that I did. This is a good CD for a hardcore fan, or just someone who wants one CD of cannibal corpse in their collection. My favorite song is ""hammer smashed face""-- and the live version included here is awesome. I have seen the VHS version of ""Live Cannibalism"" in stores, and I hope they will put it out on DVD. Until then, this awesome CD will satisfy my death metal needs for awhile..."
5,BEST LIVE BAND EVER IT IS MINDBLOWING,This is the best live cd i have ever heard it has the 18 of 25 favorite songs up to 2000.I have many live cds this by far the very best i am a huge fan of CC and also live cds and i fell in love with this when i found it so many bonecrunching riffs. Corpsegrinder is the best deathgrowler i ever heard live or in studio it is so mindblowing.
5,This one goes out to eggplant,"GO REVIEW YOUR HEROIN ADDICTED SILLY BOYS SUBLIME. LEAVE CANNIBAL CORPSE ALONE, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.THIS IS AN EXCELLENT LIVE ALBUM FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN CANNIBAL CORPSE AND DEATH METAL IN GENERAL. DO NOT LISTEN TO NAY SAYERS WHO KNOW NOT WHAT THEY SAY."
5,Supreme Live Act,"this is Deathemtal at its best, Cannibal are like a big nasty machine live, bodies are tossed forth, limbs are hacked and all else. The sound is unmatched within the genre as is the playing, ultra cool solos, fast riffs, technical playing. A lot of cool surprises in here as well, puttin a fresh face on a lot of the old classics, whether it a new solo or variation of the riff, Corpse simply wont be stopped."
5,Great live album...,"What kind of cover art is that!??? I know that almost all the CC cd cover arts are somewhat disgusting and entertaining...this one is weird...and also one of the funniest cover art ever... enuff about the cover... Well, I can't say enough about how good this band performs live!!! The live tracks sounds better than the studio tracks!!! You can feel the intense energy from these guys, and they sound brutal at the most!!! One of best live album I've ever owned since deicide's where satan lives and brutal truth's good-bye cruel world..."
3,Very Good Live Recording,"Live Cannibalism, Cannibal Corpse's first (and at time of writing only) live recording is on the whole very good. Excellent performance and sound. The track selection is good. In fact I was surprised that some of my favorites like 'Meat Hook Sodomy' and 'F*cked With A Knife' made the list. Of course I would have liked to have had 'The Bleeding' as well, but alas. The songs are played almost identically to the studio originals. One thing I would have liked is more interaction with the audience on the part of Corpsegrinder. And perhaps something extra for those of us who have these albums already (i.e. a new studio track or something akin to that). As it is I rate this 7/10, recommended for any fan of the band or any newcomer."
2,For fans only,"The ""Live Cannibalism"" album, while halfway decent for the outfit's fanatics, may be a tad raw for average metal-goers. I do not mean raw as in ""heavy"" or ""brutal"", but raw as in unpolished or lackluster. Most of the songs appearing on the disc are among Cannibal Corpse's finest tunes, especially those from their most recent studio album ""Bloodthirst""; however, they've never had enough juice to their preformances to spawn a ""live"" release. In other words, every song here can be found in better form on their studio albums, though ""Live Cannibalism"" would be a good sampler CD for individuals interested in the group."
4,"Right Book, Right Price","Very good book. And the price was right. Have not finished the book yet, but so far it very interesting."
4,Brothers in Arms Double Time,"This game is the combination of the previously released Brothers in Arms Hill to Road 30 and Earned in Blood. There seem to be no differences thus far into playing though the body and visual co-ordiantion seem to be less precise than the PC version I am used to (or maybe I need more Wii practice). The Wii zapper is definitely helpful and would recommend it. Having both Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood in the PC version and having played them much, I bought Double Time because I thought the zapper make the game more dynamic. I would highly recommend this game with the zapper to anyone new to the game, though I feel if you have played the game much in other formats you may be more happy moving on to their other new release."
4,Realistic Action and strategy,"You can learn basics of military strategy, and get to know from a much closer reality about D-Day history. I really recommend this game, had it before in PC version and bought it again por wii."
2,Not for me,"Not favorably impressed with this game. Too much storytelling and not nearly enough action. If I want storytelling, I have the Discovery Channel, etc."
5,Good solid product,The quality feels great. Note that mine came in red and not black like pictured. Not really a big deal since its not like I display the thing. Good tool to have if you have a car with drum brakes.
1,Terrible packaging: stale nuts,"Same problem as others. I received a package of multiple containers, most of which had broken open during shipment. Nuts did not taste good. I won't be ordering from this company again."
5,Good nuts,We love these nuts and the price is good too. They are fresh and being shelled is nice. We have bought other nuts from Klein's and they have all been fresh and tasty!
1,It did not work,DVD was in the wrong format. It would not play in any of my DVD players including the new DVD player.
5,So good to see this again!!,Well i bought Gator at a thrift store thinkin it was this movie.. Only to find out there was a sequel.. Well the 1 i remembered was White Lightning.. After my discovery i only knew i must find it! Well Amazon came through and saved the day and the whole transaction was awesome!! I finally got to sit down and watch it and loved it again considering it's been since the mid 70's since i seen it last!!
4,Solid,This is a nice solid hitch lock. The rubber cover over the lock fits tight and does a great job keeping the mud and water out.
5,Its a sweet cd,"Despair is a great band. They broke up recently and the vocalist went to a band called ""Buried Alive"" on Victory Records."
