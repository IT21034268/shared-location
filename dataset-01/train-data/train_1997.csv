1,"GOOD VOICES, BUT TERRIBLE IMAGE!!","This video brings some of the most beautiful opera voices of all time. Everyone in the cast is just superb!! The problem is the video itself. Some of the scenes are set in such darkness that you can not see a thing! Images are too dark throughout the whole video. The other problem is the production. It has no charm. I would only recommend this video to the very pro-Aida fan. Even so, think twice before you spend your money on this video. The San Francisco production as well as the Metropolitan production may not bring such good voices, but you can at least see the singers."
2,ordered xxl,"Leg length is a joke ordered xxl might fit a 28"" inseam(maybe) came up to my shins. Zipper on main trunk good but only goes to top of jeans I need a chair to get this thing on, zipper in legs get cought in gusset unless you run your finger down as you zip. No hook on liner bottom so it is in the velcro all the time. Very heavy,not built by a biker trying to get it on because he waited to long for the rain to go around. a person would be better to just ride through a small rain, would be ok for those days when you and leave it on all day."
2,"cool, but too small for being xxl","works perfectly, but the legs size are too short, you must buy boots for getting complete water proof"
3,a little dull,I pretty much bought this album for one particular song ... and that's pretty much the only one I enjoy. It's pretty typical soulless dance music ... but it's still ok.
1,Not what I thought!,"I that it would be a real dance music cd. But its not. Ok thats fine, but its not even cool house,grove or lounge music. Did not like at all, and I am a fan of his music. I would skip this one!"
3,Finally a book on Gods,"I was both impressed and disappointed with this book. It was nice to see a book covering Gods instead of Goddesses for a change. It covered a wide variety of Gods From Indian to Kabbala. However, I was disappointed in what seems to be several inaccuracies in this book. In a day where it is hard to find a book on Gods this book is a go. For anyone wanting more in depth study, keep looking. This is a good beginner book."
1,"Confusing, discordant material...","There was absolutely no story or context to any of the films and the result was a mish-mash of material where you never know where you are at or where you are going.As the other reviewer notes, experimental films are a tough nut to crack to start with. This sort of disjointed material makes it impossible.Some of the camera work was creative and even the editing showed some style. Yet the final product as a whole left nothing to grab on to and no point was made, if there was one."
2,Not so good,"The sound quality is poor (no reverb in the recording). It sounds like playing in a small room.Intonation is no good, and all caprices are played so fast and no clean, no pretty. Is a simple demostration of speed but no pleasant to the ears.I recommend listen to Frank Peter Zimmermann recording of the 24 caprices, in second place, Perlman."
4,a must read for beginner programmers,"this book is simple to read and well laid out. It actually makes programming look easy and comprensive. It teaches logical thinking, and the methods can be applied to any programming language."
2,WARNING! CAUTION! DANGER! AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!,"WARNING! CAUTION! DANGER! AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!Yet another book I was forced to buy for my programming course. Once again, I highly recommend avoiding this author. Although this book isn't quite as bad as some of her other work, she still does a pretty good job of confusing you quite often. Fortunately I was able to beat my way through the book and most of it was common sense. She even managed to confuse me a time or two on things that I previously understood. All in all, if you see the name Joyce M. Farrell -- RUN!WARNING! CAUTION! DANGER! AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!"
1,Yoga for Healthy Bones,This book is very informative. A good reference for diet and lifestyle for a healthy body and lifestyle.
5,An concise exploration of a complex subject,"One wonders if the confused lone critic who is ranting against this beautiful book has read more than its title ... sad how some individuals feel the need to vent their own spiritual anger in the most inappropriate places. ""A Taste of Water"" is refreshing inspiration for anyone who is serious about exploring the possibility of a spiritual path that encompasses Eastern as well as Western religion/philosophy. I would highly recommend this book, and yes, it can be found by those who know where to seek ..."
5,AWESOME SPEAKERS,"All I have to say is what a beautiful sounding set of speakers!!! I have mine setup Bi-wire on 100 rms for high side and same for low side, they sound so good and really don't need a sub but I have mine paired with a Martin Logon sub and my HT setup is at AWE ;-)Pros: everything!!!!!!Neg: nothing at all!!!!Must have"
5,The Real Thing,"It is one thing to read about the atrocities in the Sudan in the daily newspaper. It is quite another to hear first-hand the stories of real people who witnessed and experienced unspeakable crimes against humanity. I was shaken to the core by this book. It is one that everyone should read, especially those of us who will never travel to the Sudan in person. It challenges us to pray, to write to our government for assistance for these people, and to give from our own wealth to help in whatever way is possible."
4,A story of hope,"So begins the story of the Lost Boys, children, some much younger than Abraham, who fled from the horror of those who butchered their families into the desert. They fled without adequate food, water and clothes. They fled, pursued by soldiers who found pleasure in torture. Yet, despite the hardships, many not only survive, but found their faith sustained them.Read entire review at AUTHOR'S CHOICE REVIEWS http://come.to/bookreviews"
1,Lost book,"I couldn't read this book. I skimmed it, but I couldn't read it. It was disjointed and disappointing. I don't think it adequately portrayed the situation. Also, I don't mind reading religious material, but I like to know it's religious material before I buy it."
4,IT WAS FINE,"GOT IT FOR MY 22YR OLD DAUGHTER. SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY OF THE SHOWS, SHE LAUGHED HER HEAD OFF. IT GAVE A GOOD MIX OF HIS SKITS."
3,Not a bad game,"I bought this game for $, and I cant say I was completely disappointed, but it just isn't a game that interests me too much. The graphics are ok and the controls aren't bad, but you can easily be confused and it just isnt very exciting. Its not too bad though, it's worth a shot."
2,kind of disappointing,"Some of the code examples in this book are laughably wrong. Especially the section about declaring arrays. There must be at least a dozen different kinds of errors in the section about declaring arrays. The author even gets wrong that the number you give in an array declaration is the upper-bound not the size. It makes you question how well the author really understands the language. Also, the book skimps on certain important areas, such as dynamically adding event handlers. Overall, I'd say this book is not that great for an introduction (too many errors) and lacking as an advanced guide (not enough detail). So I'm not really sure who it would be useful for."
3,hozer,"I have just finished the first 7 chapters. I feel like I am reading a beginner's VB book (the author has already written a beginner's version). I think that overall the book is good, but I am tired of reading an explanation of some point, and then getting hit over the head again and again on the same point.I hope this book gets better and less repetitive as it goes on and on and on."
3,Need more content,Overall it's a decent book VB language. However if it has more contents/examples on Windows Form will make it a lot better.
4,Good Book,"This is a typical OReilly book. It is starts from the ground up, ignores fancy IDE's and aims at serious programmers. The code examples are solid, and the explanation of the three pillars of object oriented programming was far better than what was in my college programming books. It does have a few downfalls, nothing serious. Firstly, the examples are kind of boring. Who wants to make a file manager? And why is that always the big final project at the end of every VB book?! VB can be much more fun than that. Secondly, the IDE is not explained very well, which is a mixed blessing. I'd prefer more detail on it's nice features, but they are easy enough to figure out for the average developer on his own. The last few chapters are excellent, starting with the ADO.NET elaboration. Overall, an above average learning tool, and an excellent reference especially for those moving from VB 6.0."
5,Batting for Roberts,"Five stars doesn't seem to quite cover it. The introduction alone - on the POLITICATION of the judiciary - is perhaps the greatest legal text since The Common Law. Essential reading for the upcoming battle over CJ Roberts. The hall of shame of those who scuttlebuggered his nomination - Ted ""involuntary manslaughter"" Kennedy, Joe ""speech stealer"" Biden and co - shouldn't be forgotten ....."
5,Magnificent Work,"This is simply a superb book. There isn't much else to say! If you want to understand what is going on in the battles over SC nominees, read this book."
1,don't waste your money.,"I had to buy this for a research project since I mark up my reference works when working with them. As I have said of other Bork works, Bork is bork and screed is screed."
4,West Coast-South Side,"Partner's in crime for many years, it would still seem to be a slightly out of kilter teaming of the ""original jam band guitar hero with Nick the Greek Gravinites"". It is not. A dream come true for Cipollina fans, [almost nothing available in the way of visual record] this also offers proof of Gravenites strength as a singer, and surprising evidence of his guitar skills, as well as a long, loving look at one of the most original,and sadly overlooked electric guitarists of his, or any time."
2,meh,"I took a shot at this after seeing Cathy sing with those old Hippies, she has a great voice, stage presence, but not captured in this album. I guess I was hoping for something more like Lucinda Williams. oh well, my wife might like it..."
2,"Disappointing, a bit sensational and little new ground covered","I have now read five books on this subject and this is my least favorite. If you want to know the facts about this fascinating story almost any other book is better. However, if you are reading more than one or two books on the subject of Roanoke then it's worth the read just for the conspiracy theories. Found the writing style unbearable and almost put this book down several times despite my interest in the subject matter. Read some other book first, though."
4,Historical mystery!,"Found this book while in the Outer Banks on vacation this summer, after having seen The Lost Colony (for the third time) performed in Manteo, and just had to read it. Several people criticize the author's writing, and at times it was a little exasperating -- hoping for a conclusion, and then sent in a different direction -- but isn't that how a good mystery is supposed to be? I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Loved the author's descriptions of life in London, the many indian tribes and the way our country must have looked. And as far as the solution -- until something definite to the contrary can be unearthed, this makes perfect sense."
2,Interesting assertions but not effectively supported.,"Miller's theories on the fate of the Roanoke Colony are quite controversial and border on conspiracy theory. In order to give credance to these controversial theories, she had to include a great deal of historical referrences. This created a dichotomy of style straddling narrative and historical treatise. This caused difficulties with both styles. The narrative, while compelling, is often interrupted by the historical references. However, the theories put forward in the narrative depend on ascribing the political motivations of the people involved. That would be a nearly impossible task no matter how much documentation that was presented. Miller augments the documents she sites with layers of supposition and conjecture."
3,Fascinating thesis. Bad writing. You decide.,"Was the lost colony a tragic disaster, or a shrewdly engendered mass murder? Miller has made some fantastic connections to piece together her version of the mystery. It is a fascinating idea, and I found some of her proof and reasoning quite compelling. The use of intertextual first person accounts was also quite helpful.However, while ""Roanoke"" had some great ideas, it was so poorly written as to be almost unreadable at times. Sentence fragments float wildly. Ideas are begun and then abandoned only to reappear from nowhere two pages later. The short choppy paragraph structure is highly distracting, and left me constantly feeling unsatisfied. I did manage to finish, but only because I am really interested in the Lost Colony. If you are not, I suggest a more clearly written account."
2,"Somewhat interesting, but flawed","The mystery of the Lost Colony has always been fascinating to me and I am always interested in reading books about it, so I bought this one as soon as it came out. While it is clear that the author has done a great deal of research, her methodology leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't like how she interspersed quotes from primary materials into her text, because it was often impossible to determine what those materials were or who wrote them. Also, I have to wonder if she is taking these quotes out of context and placing them where they fit her arguments best. This approach weakens her arguments. Also, her constant use of incomplete sentences annoyed me and I am surprised her editor let her get away with this. Whereas she makes some interesting observations about the mystery, I suspect that this book will not be taken very seriously by the historical community because of its methodological flaws and its grammatical errors."
2,"Oh, for a grammar lesson!!","This could have been a first rate book. It has almost everything--great subject, impressive research, history from both sides of the Atlantic, even a great looking cover. I could hardly read it--and I LOVE to read history. Why, why, why did Miller write in practically nothing but incomplete sentences? I would just start to be swept along with the fascinating story when I would be caught up short with yet another incomplete sentence. Quite disturbing."
2,Unable to finish,"Disjointed. Out of sequence. Full of questionable assumptions. Short, choppy sentences. Without a subject or verb. Now, imagine an entire 332 page book written in this style. I couldn't finish it. There are far better books on the topic."
3,Could have been better,"This interesting book covers a lot of ground on both sides of the Atlantic. It is impressive how she juxtaposes political intrigue in Elizabethan England with Native American orthography. I am convinced. I wish, however, that Miller had had an editor. Her writing style was in some places very choppy, to the point of being annoying. In addition, her arguments were not always developed as clearly as they could have been. In some places, the arguments were developed in the footnotes rather than the text. Finally, the book could have used maps with more details (even if some of the details would need to be speculative). Overall, a good read, but it could have been better."
1,Mystery of the Lost Verbs,"Author with a great idea. Rush of words, no verbs. Out of nowhere. Great dustjacket. Unreadable."
4,"Enjoyable Story - Not too ""heavy""","I enjoy reading history but I'm not a ""historian"". This book was a great read, the author laid out the sequence of events and the facts very well and it was easy to follow.I would recommend this book because it was very informative, revealing much about Elizabethan England, and things that were going on culturally right before the English colonization of North America.All in all, this was an awesome book and I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in history or this time period."
3,Solved?,"Having enjoyed a visit to the mystery island itself, I was looking forward to a new treatment of this puzzling historical mystery. While Miller did a creditable job of summarizing what is known about the Roanoke debacle, did she actually solve the mystery? Not in my book! This bit of nonfiction ranks along with Cornwell's recent attempt to pin the Jack the Ripper murders on her favorite suspect. Interesting but not conclusive. Perhaps some things will have to be forever consigned to the imagination. Perhaps that's why, over the centuries, they intrigue us so."
4,Don't let this one disappear!,"When I go on vacation, I take three books: two popular fictions and something that makes me think. I choose Roanoke this year and boy, did I pick the right one! I saw Lee Miller in a TV interview and that's what alerted me to her work. In an interesting format, she turns what could be dry research into a poignant story. There are two images in her book that I will never forget (no spoilers here! find them for yourself). Yes, it's a deep read; occasionally I had to go back and reread certain paragraphs to make sure I understood her point; but when I was done, I was glad I picked this one up."
2,agree with other reviewer: poor writing ruins book,"2 stars for content....but, the unending stream of sentence fragments is so annoying as to render book unreadable. I am 1/3 of the way through and will NOT read further. Lee Miller should get a ghost writer or a better editor."
3,Content,I have a hard time with the content because of the way this is written. Run-on sentences and incomplete sentences are throughout the book. May be the way this author writes but it's not easy to follow at times.
3,Lazy Writing?,"I agree with the reviewer from Belgium. The story is interesting and Miller's research is impressive. Perhaps I'd have been able to follow the book's theories more easily if I weren't so stunned by the use of sentence fragments. Almost constantly. For what reason? Impact?Well, imagine reading an entire book like this. There was an impact. Negative.And yet, if you can ignore the fragments because you truly love history, I still think you'll enjoy the book.Recommended with reservations."
2,Major Disappointment,"There are a wide range of opinions on this book, but for me it was a disappointment. It was, in my opinion, poorly written and poorly organized. I was looking for something a little more academic. Perhaps a good editor could have made a difference."
4,easy but toxic,"Bought this to do about 60 sq. ft. Easy to use product and matched existing orange peel texture nicely. It does leave a strong odor, but does say to use in well ventilated area. definitely had to air out the area after use, but did the job with minimal clean-up."
3,"it's only one lock box, and a cheap one at that","it's one key lock box, and one key holder. the internal foam needs to be removed if you have 2 house keys."
3,A fascting book,"The authors' premises are, at least to me, persuasive. In the permissive climate of the late 60's and 70's Catholic culture changed. In the enthusiastic climate, feelings supplanted careful thought. Enthusiasm became both normal and normative.At our best Catholicism melds both both and reason. The authors of this book are right in suggesting that, in these decades, it was altogether too easy for many priests to eschew the traditional disciplines of prayer. And so, for some, it the maelstrom of a benign and inviting secular culture - with its step-brother of post-modernism - feelings dominated over faith and reason.Readers will struggle with the authors' treatment of Aquinas. While I respect and agree with them, this does not make for an easy read.This book is not an easy read. But its authors are careful and thoughtful."
2,"Unfortunately, the Only Book on the Topic","The murder of Sir Harry Oakes and the subsequent investigation, together with a supreme cast of characters, cries out for some actual literary talent to come to bear on the subject. Unfortunately, very little in the way of ability is evident here. Sir Harry Oakes was one of the early land merchants of Nassau and a friend and cohort of various British social luminaries of the post-WWII-era, including the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor. What could be a compelling account of his mysterious murder, which has never been solved to satisfaction to this day, is instead a clumsily written attempt at conspiracy grasping and groundless guessing on Marigny's part. The actual writing was no doubt done by Mickey Herskowitz, who has been paid to ghost-write numerous books. For those who have spent enough time on the island to be acquainted with its history and legends, this is the only source I'm aware of for any treatment of the story. That's a shame."
5,Two-Tone,"I have this watch in the two-tone version and it is absolutely gorgeous. I seldom wear yellow gold but this is my favorite watch (and I have many)! It is classy but also has good weight to it. Somehow I managed to chip the sapphire crystal (I must have banged it against something very hard). I took it to Ben Bridge at the local mall. Because the crystal is curved, they had to order a new one. It can definitely take a beating but with the new crystal, it's as good as new. You won't be disappointed by this watch...it is worth every penny you spend on it. Enjoy!"
5,"Simple, Concise, Powerful Read","If you have never read a technical analysis book then I highly recommend this above everything else. For startes it's barely over 200 pages short, with more than half those pages dedicated to charts. Simply put you only read about 100 pages.The beauty is those 100 pages are powerful and geared perfectly for the beginner. After reading this book I was bitting at the bit to apply my new knowledge, and no longer regard picking stocks as a crap-shoot.You CAN educate yourself to financial freedom, and this book will help you do that."
5,Well written and easy to understand,This book covers the basics of chart reading with clear writing and valuable and instructive exercises. I highly recommend it!
5,Wow!,"If you like power pop full of clever lyrics, masterful orchestration, beautiful harmonies and tunes that you can't get out of your minds, you must have this CD. I'd rank it among the very best power pop CDs EVER."
3,Pinkerton makes the use of his lack of training,My 2 and 4 year old childeren love this title. Lovable Great Dane Pinkerton does not learn his lessons very well. When sent to obiediance school he teaches all the other dogs behave just like him. It is not until a burgular enters into his home that Pinkerton shows his true colors.
1,SCARIEST BOOK I'VE SEEN FOR PRESCHOOLERS!,Be aware that this book shows the burglar holding a gun to the mother's head as the child watches--if that's not terrifying to a preschooler then I don't know what would be!
1,"Kellogg, Think!","My four-year-old daughter was subjected to this travesty of a children's book in preschool. Ever since, she has awakened nightly at 3 a.m., tears streaming down her face, worried about burglars coming through her window. I'm not ""squeamish"" or a ""namby-pamby"" as suggested by other condescending reviewers of this book. But I do value my sleep. If you value yours, pass this one up. There are many other good children's books out there."
2,"It's my job to worry about robbers, not my 3 year old's.","I was unimpressed with the picture of a gun-toting robber coming into the house. Especially since the mother was essentially helpless while the dog lay sound asleep.Furthermore, it is not my 3 year old's job to worry about robbers sneaking into her house in the middle of the night. That's my job.I probably would have given this book 4 stars if the mother had at least been empowered enough to fight the intruder - with deadly force, if necessary. At least that would make a child feel safe in her home. But to have to depend on a dog that's too stupid to wake up when a bad guy sneaks into the house?! How scary for my 3 year old!"
1,NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS!,"I picked up this book at the library for my 4 and 6 year olds. I usually scan through the books before checking them out, but this one got away from me. I was shocked and then mad, while reading this to my kids, to see a scary man breaking in through a bedroom window with a gun in his hand!! He then threatened the mother and held the gun to her head!!! GEE - fun stuff kids - it's a laugh riot!My bad for not checking through every page - but isn't there a certain level of ""safeness"" implied in children's books - especially ones with goofy dogs on the front???"
1,"Gun to head, home invasion story = nightmares for months","I can't possibly imagine what was going through the head of the author, illustrator, and editor as they thought it was a good idea to show a creep looking man climbing through the bedroom window and pointing a gun to the mother's head while she is frozen in panic in her bed, threatening to ""blast her to chicken powder"".As if I don't have enough to worry about, now I get 15 minutes of crying each night about ""The bad men that will come in our room"". Thanks, much not appreciated."
1,Not appropriate for young children,"Fun story, but author takes it to the extreme. There are many ways he could have illustrated Pinkerton's silly behavior, but he chose to use a burglar breaking in a window and holding someone at gunpoint. The illustrations of these scenes are very thorough, and therefore pretty scary. Even for older children, I don't think this is something that I would choose to expose them to. I don't want to read picture books about gun violence to my sweet children."
5,This book helped get me a job,"Recently I was ""redeployed"" - which is the word that my company uses for ""laid off if you can't find another job (quick) within the company"". I speed-read this book, like cramming for an exam, and applied for the junior database administrator position and got it! Later, the senior DBA told me that I got the job because I knew subtle things about SQL and relational databases that the other candidates didn't know (or got wrong). For example, the difference between a database and a DBMS, why SQL doesn't stand for ""Structured Query Language"", the difference between server and desktop DBMSes, what the ""relational"" in ""relational database"" refers to, the normal forms, and the difference between SQL syntax and semantics. Most of these things were in the first few chapters. Author! Author!"
4,Lovely Grace Moore,Grace Moore is delightful in this French film. Charpentier himself coached her for this filmed opera. The film gets dark and brooding at times but this is a must for Opera lovers.
3,"good read, but plot unravels too quickly at the end","I just wanted to add a slightly less positive review of Erdman's ""The Setup"". This is a good quick read suitable for the airplane or beach -- it is fast-paced, enjoyable escapism a la Grisham. But my big complaint is that the plot wraps up too easily in the last 50 pages; everything falls into place much too quickly and with no resistance whatsoever. This lets some of the air out of the tires of an otherwise decent plot. But if you have six or seven hours to kill and you don't want to read anything too mind-intensive, then I would certainly recommend this book. Who knows, you might even learn something about currency trading along the way."
5,"Easy to read, yet taut and suspenseful!","Having been a long-time Erdman fan, I found the ""Set-Up"" one of Erdman's better works. He keeps pace with changes in the golbal financial marke, writes a great mystery that keeps you gussing at how the protagonist will discover what is happening, yet it is easy to understand for those of us who are not well-educated in global financial matters. If there is a flaw, it is that it takes a long time to get the background of the nature of the charges against Charles Black, but after finishing the book, I realized why it was done that way. I got the book as a gift Christmas night, and read non-stop the entire weekend. WOnderful plot and superb character development. Bravo, Mr. Erdman!"
1,Boring,"I have read a lot of boring books this year, but this one takes the cake.I didn't feel much for the main character...and I sure couldn't follow all the intricate twists and turns taken to set him up for a financial fall.I won't be reading any more of this author's work. I am simply not interested in the world of high finance. It's hard to drum up sympathy for someone whose net worth is around 29 million...."
4,"A page turner, difficult to put down.","I really wish Paul Erdman wrote more books. I have enjoyed everyone of his novels. No one of them is better than another, they are all good.Erdman's novels are centered around investments economics and high finance adventure. To an economist they are especially exciting but I think for most readers they are each an excellent read and The Set-up is no exception. I highly recommend it."
5,Brilliant,I am a first time Marian Keyes reader and I was impressed. Last Chance Saloon was one the most heartwarming and funniest books I have read in a while.
4,Life-long friends and life changing decisions...,"Finton, Katherine and Tara have been life-long friends! Finton works in the fashion industry and has the boyfriend of his dreams. Katherine is so consumed with her work that her guy-life... wait, she doesn't have a guy life. Tara has never NOT had a boyfriend and thinks she's happy with Thomas. But when Finton finds out he has cancer, he decides to force them into being happy. He wants Katherine to go out with the guy who's been flirting with her at work, to put her boundries down and go for it AND he wants Tara to dump Thomas, she can do better. The three friends learn from each other and start to conquer their fears so they can live life to it's fullest!This is a great book, Marian Keyes portrays Finton's illness in such an amazing way, as well as the emotional feats Katherine and Tara must deal with to honestly be happy."
2,Not much happens,"I first picked this book because I am almost 30 years old and single, so I thought that I might be living a similar situation than the characters in this book.Unfortunatly I think that , exept for the last 3 chapters, not much happens in the story.And believe me that 563 pages to read where the story is not moving is bad!I think the most develop character was Katherine,specially at the end of the story.Tara's story was interesting as well, however you get to wonder if she ever found someone or not!Fintan's illness, although touchingly sad, seemed to be just an excuse to trigger an output (as he made some requests to his friends).A personal question to the author: Do you have something against Third World Countries? By the way, Chile where I live, is much more developed ,less poor and more peacefull than Ireland ,for example."
3,Enjoyable,"It was funny at times, but overall I can't say it was a really great book. Still, it was very difficult to put down, so I read it very quickly."
1,What the.....,"Ok.... I have read all Marian's books. I thought Rachel's Holiday was absolutely fantastic. A masterpiece, in fact. Movie material, even.... I'm telling you her 3 last books were good ( Rachel's being the best , of course )What I'm trying to say is that The Last Chance Saloon was absolute crap. These people with positive reviews are deceiving. Must be friends of hers. I was so horribly dissapointed with this book.. it was not funny, not imaginative, not creative, nor engaging."
2,"""Sorry, Not Very Good""","I had previously read ""Lucy Sullivan gets married,"" ""Watermelon""and ""Rachel's Holiday."" All were fantastic! I couldn't wait until I read this one....Well, it is not like the other books. I found my mind wondering, and hoping something happened. I didn't like this one at all. ""Total Thumbs Down!!"" I hope Marian writes another page turner like the first three. But this one dosen't come close. Skip it!!"
3,Flat,"There were several interesting characters.....but some if their stories were trite. The book had a good started, and then just fizzled out.....like a coke....fizzy at first, but after it sits a bit-------goes flat."
5,"Classic Keyes, Hilarious!","Hyperbolic, hilarious, poignant, Marian Keyes at her best. I love this book and have read it multiple times. The characters are so endearing and the story just draws you into their lives.Love it!"
5,loved it,"a friend of mine left this at my house to read when she flew back home. and i absolutely loved it!of all it's 500-600 pages i had it read in about four days. i couldn't put it down!it's a great read, like a warm sweater. comforting, indulgent, and so much fun."
2,not that interesting.........,"After reading all the great reviews, I figured I would give this author a try. Borrowed this book from my local library almost 1.5 weeks ago.I found this to be boring and not very interesting, the story just did not catch my attention and was hard for me to keep going. I found nothing that was funny at all! Maby it is just this book, but I will try another one just to see how it goes. I do love Chic lit though! Just found this one to be painful to keep going..."
2,Very disappointing,"I've read all of Marian Keyes' books, and I am sorry to say that I first saw a downhill slide with Angels, and it continued with this book. Full of cliches (as another reviewer noted) and the token gay friend, it seemed like a half-hearted effort. I have Sushi for Beginners yet to read but I am a little apprehensive about it-I'll give it a try, but if it's as bad as Last Chance Saloon and Angels, I'm afraid I will have to give up on Keyes, who used to be one of my favorite modern writers."
2,disappointed,"I had heard so much about Marian Keyes and was looking forward to reading my first of her books - The Last Chance Saloon. What a disappointment. Cliched and dull with no emotional depth. I found each character to be a laboured stereotype and the plot dragged on and on and around in circles. Some aspects - such as Tara's obsession with food and the problems with her boyfriend - were repetious. We knew the boyfriend was awful as soon as he was introduced as a character because Ms Keye's told us so. Why did she have to keep telling us - we got it the first time! I know that a book is not doing well when one of the main characters might die and I don't care.However, I'm glad to see that other readers who were equally as disappointed enjoyed Ms Keye's earlier books. Maybe I'll give those a try if I see them. Surely the fuss about her must have some basis................."
3,"Not my favorite Keyes, but enjoyable","If you're looking for a light-hearted read, then this is the Keyes novel for you. If you're looking for something with a little more depth, then try Watermelon or Rachel's Holiday. Still, Keyes has the knack for writing about women and their many moods and experiences. I appreciate her honest approach and keen sense of wit and dialogue."
4,Liked it the best of her books,"I read Rachel's Holiday and thought it was decent. I tried to read Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married (it sounded funny and got good reviews) but couldn't get past the first chapter. So, obviously I was hesitant to buy yet another book by an author who had yet to thrill me. Well, she came pretty close. I read this book laying on a beach over vacation, and was totally into it. I think that in this story, unlike Rachel's holiday which I didn't think was funny, her writing is witty, her characters likeable, and the story makes you want to read on. THIS is the one Keyes book I would suggest. It was intelligent, amusing and enjoyable."
4,Last Chance Saloon Lends a Shoulder,"I loved this book. Keyes really hits the nail on the head describing the relationship many women have with each other, with men and sometimes how it all relates back to how we feel about our bodies. The cast of characters in this book allowed me to get in touch with different aspects of my self and the way I am going through my own bigtime break up. So the girls in ""Last Chance Saloon"" became not only parts of me but also my girlfriends that lent me a shoulder during this not very fun time. Definately a good read. Left me feeling good."
4,great read...hard to put down!,I love the works by Marian Keyes and this book is no exception. I laughed out loud and I can't wait for another one by this talented author! I enjoyed the unveiling of the secondary story and it's eventual merger with the main story. The characters and their situations were quite relatable.
3,Not that hot,"I guess I'm the lone naysayer in the bunch. While I enjoyed the plot, overall, and did find myself caring about the characters I just didn't think the writing (especially the dialogue) matched the Bridget Jones books or the Stephanie Plum books mentioned in earlier reviews. Don't think I'll be trying another Keyes...can't wait until my next Stephanie Plum book, though!"
4,Great Light Reading! (perfect for beaches and mass transit!),"Thanks god for books like this. I would never survive my commute without them.The stories of Katherine, Tara and Finton, are well... a bit predicable and almost cliché by American standards. I have admit I was not impressed by the plot. You don't have to read the whole book to know how it's going to end. But mayb that's just me.... Maybe I've watched too many Friends and Beverly Hills 90210 episodes.Nevertheless, I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down, (not even while going through the turnstile at the EL station.) And it did inspire me to think about how valuable our time with friends/family really is, one of the main thems in the book. So I'm happy that I read it.Not impressed..but happy = 4stars.Ps. If you liked Bridget Jones, well... you'll like this too."
2,Predictable Tripe,"Like so much of Brit chick lit, this book fails to deliver on its promise of being the next Bridget Jones. This novel fails to flesh out the cardboard, stereotypical characters (the fat girl, the ice queen, the gay guy, the womanizer), and sets them into a you'll-see-it-a-mile-away Afterschool Special plot. It's an easy, yet vapid read -- substitute Jessica, Elizabeth, Bruce, etc. for the characters and this book could be a part of the Sweet Valley High series."
2,Waste of Time,"I really wanted to like this book, but it turned out to be full of cliches, and generally pretty boring."
5,Subtly memorable characters.,"This is the first Marian Keyes book I've read. I was irritated at times with the plot and enchanted at other times with her witty and lyrical phrases. I began reading it as a desperate attempt to get back into the reading life. It has since become my salvation from TV enslavement. I should give this book 3 stars because it isn't the best writing around, but then how can I say that when at the end of the book I was sad to say goodbye to all those characters? Whether you like the plot or not, think the characters make idiotic or illogical choices, it doesn't matter. Keyes' writing is something to enjoy. I have continued on to read two of her other books and have become a devoted fan."
5,couldn't put it down!,"This was the first book I read by Marian Keyes and it was wonderful. Every emotion you could possibly feel comes out when reading this book. I actually had to make myself stop reading so I could read some more the next day. And as I neared the end of it, I tried not to read because I didn't want it to end. Sounds weird but, I felt like I lost my good friends when I finished it. The way Keyes wrote this book makes you feel very close to the characters. I have recommended this book to all of my friends."
4,The Rollercoaster of Life,"Well, this book started out wonderfully for me. Marian Keyes was flowing like a river. She was tasteful and each character had so much character. The love between these friends (14 years and running) was insatiable. Three women and one man (and his significant other). All was going well, with the ups and downs of life. Each was there for the other and then we were sent a ""blow"". One of the main characters took gravely ill. This sent me for a loop. I thought this book was supposed to be humor-filled. I cried and even had an anxiety attack during the pre, during and post diagnosis.All-in-all, she is an excellent writer. It was enjoyable and I hated to put it down. However, before reading her others books, I need to find out if she goes into detail regarding illness or the like...........it was just too devastating living through this....."
3,Poor Binding,"The book is not her best work however the content is similar in style and humor. I found funny anecdotes relative to the stages of being in ""30's"".The pages are out of sequence so you need to skip around to follow the story."
3,Cute Beach Read,"While this book is a fun read, it has some added benefits--Marian Keyes really knows how to develop characters. Her characters are complex, screwed up, happy and sad in the same breath--basically, they're real. While the plot and the story weren't especially interesting, it's worth reading just to experience Keyes' way of description."
4,enjoyable reading,I am not finished but wanted to let fellow readers know that this book is an enjoyable read.
3,Wait to buy the DVD.,"If you are thinking about buying this interesting but somewhat flawed film, wait until the end of August. Apparently, Universal is releasing another DVD edition with -- believe it or not -- DVD extras, such as trailers, behind the scenes information, ""making of"" features, and so on. I think the release date is August 27, 2002. Why they released the original DVD without any extras is beyond me ... but, then again, if I ran a film company, I suppose I would do it too-- makes people buy the DVD twice."
2,"slick images, but they don't work together","This is a remake of a 1942 film by the same title. Rent this ifyou're interested, but before purchasing, try getting a hold ofthe original. The black and white predecessor to this film isfar superior, and most movie critics agree (check the reviewsites). Why? Because the original respects the imagination ofthe viewer, and achieves an incredible state of tension withoutovert violence and gore. It is much in the Hitchcock tradition, and if you don't like that great master's films, then you might as well just... forget it."
4,Cat People (1982)-Loved it!,"Cat People (1982) was easily a four star film starring Nastassia Kinski. I first learned about this movie some years after it was released by reading an article in Cinefantastique magazine which praised the movie and its special effects. It had great atmosphere, a good cast, really great special effects and a musical score that worked at setting the mood. It was a remake that did credit to the original."
4,"A haunting, erotic horror movie","""Cat People"" has two things going for it: a creepy, intriguing story line; and Nastassia Kinski. Kinski is absolutely mesmerizing in the title role; an erotic, exotic presence awakening to her own sexuality and discovering that she can only have a life with one of her own kind. Paul Schrader's direction lends a eerily spooky atmosphere to the film. Malcolm McDowell is excellent as Kinski's brother who sees her as his only salvation, as she sees him as her destruction; John Heard is okay but nothing special as Kinski's lover who finally realizes what she is and commits the act that at once sets her free and imprisons her for the rest of her life; and Ruby Dee has a small but haunting role as the landlady who knows Kinski's secret and confronts her with the devastating reality of what lies ahead for her. There's plenty of blood and plenty of gore, but it all fits in with the story. It's not a great movie, but it's a very good one that deserves a wider audience."
3,Intriguing Horror Remake,"Director Paul Schrader's revamp of the Val Lewton classic is uneven yet visually striking. ""Cat People"" (1982) benefits from the stunning presence of Nastassja Kinski, John Bailey's evocative New Orleans photography and a mesmerizing score by Giorgio Moroder. Unfortunately, Schrader's cinematic horror lacks the subtlety and restraint of the 1942 Lewton production. Though Schrader takes DeWitt Bodeen's original story on an intriguingly different path, the explicit gore works against the film. Regardless of its missteps, ""Cat People"" remains preferable to the ludicrous slasher movies that haunt your neighborhood cineplexes."
4,Cat People gets its 3rd of Nine Lives!,"This re-release of the CAT PEOPLE DVD includes many extras never before seen on previous releases. Most notable is a running commentary by the director, and several excellent featurettes on the special effects. It's amazing to see so many goodies piled high on what may be considered a film of cult status.Fans of THE HUNGER or VAMPYROS LESBOS will find themselves in familiar territory. This is a sexy excercise in style over substance, but what a great fun ride it is. Schrader gives us depth in a genere much maligned for being very dumbed down. He pulls no punches as the graphic scenes of sex and violence push the envelope of any censors. Shy about gore and full frontal nudity? You should skip this title.Brainy, seductive, and always beautiful from the set to the score this one is a winner! Not at all faithful to the original Val Lewton classic, this one differs from its source as strongly as THE THING did."
3,Of COURSE it's not the Val Lewton classic...,"But that doesn't mean this version isn't worth watching on its own merits. No, none of the acting is really first-rate, and yes, some scenes are kinda strange and yes, there are a few plot holes, but all told, this remains a watchable and unexpectedly sexy film. Kinski's portrayal will remain one of the sexiest performances ever committed to film; the acting level doesn't matter; all her erotica is visual, and she's absolutely perfect for the role. Ruby Dee has a small role, but she's great. Even the cat is attractive. The remainder of the story is your basic sorta horror film, with some arresting images. Definitely worth owning, along with the original."
1,"Crass and Gory, See the Original 1942 film","Cat People is the crude, crass, and gory remake of the 1942 classic. The reason I can't recommend this film is because when compared to the original, it is simply a poor, and revolting remake. The original is everything this version is not: subtle, suspenseful, intriguing.In the original, the erotic aspects are hinted at, while the 1982 version lays it on a bit too thick. The main actress, Ms. Kinski does a fine job in this film, and we will probably never see John Heard look as fit and thin as he is here, but the rest of the acting is pretty atrocious.A very poorly made re-make. See the 1942 original."
3,Cat People,"The ending is not the best, but the performances are stellar. I can't stay away from this one, very edgy at times. Almost as good as the original. Recommended."
4,How does this compare to the 1998 DVD release of this same film?,Sound quality on both 1998 version DVD and this newer 200whatever version sucks. Why is it that I have to turn the TV up to 50 to hear the movie?
1,"oops, wrong movie","I was wanting the older version of this movie and bought this by mistake. I was, quite frankly, shocked at what was in this movie, with the excessive nudity, language etc; it went into the trash. The only positive thing is the musical score. I wanted to give it a minus 0 rating."
4,Good DVD transfer,"I recommend this DVD. It is in widescreen 1.85:1 ratio, and the picture quality is good. I agree with the previous commentator that there are no special features on the DVD which is disappointing. This is the barest DVD I have yet seen, not one extra feature, not even an option for sub-titling. But the image quality and sound quality is good. The film itself isn't an all-time classic per/se, but judged from the viewpoint of the time period when it was filmed, it is very good. A very sensual, stylized thriller filmed like a Duran Duran video. As a fan of that era, I love this film and highly reccomend it to early-80's fans everywhere!"
3,Campy,"A bit visually stressful and quite beautiful at times, the music is great. Maybe should be x rated but I enjoyed it"
2,A cheesy flick!,"There's not much to say except that this movie has little going for it (other than the obvious attractions of Nastassja Kinski--who, it must be acknowledged, is shown to good advantage here)."
2,cat people,Haven't enjoy the movie because it is hd dvd and it want play in my dvd player. I requested to receive a refund or another one. Know response.That two order of the cat people I have order the first one was a vhs now I got another one that is a HD DVD that want play in my dvd. Im stuck with 2 movies that I can't watch.
1,Disapointing!!!!,Disapointment as I could not view the product as in South Africa we cannot view NTSC or as you refer to it Region 1 so I had to return the product for a refund!!!!!!!!!
3,good before it broke,I had this banana hanger for a few months. It worked great as long as you didn't have a big bunch of bananas because then it was very hard to hang them on the hook. I was really enjoying it.Then the hook fell out of the hole at the top. I couldn't get the hook to stay back in the hole at the top. I tried super glue and tape but nothing seemed to work. I guess I'm going to need to try another one.
2,awkward hanging,"Unless I'm not doing it right, it's not been too easy getting my bananas on this hanger. Once they're on, everything is fine but it's j.ust such a bother trying to fit them on the hook"
4,good product,"good product, always use to have my bananas sitting on the counter where they would get brown spots, not anymore the hanger prevents this"
3,IT'S OK BUT.......,"It's OK But.... It is hard to Hang the Bananas ...To short of a Clamp ... NOT LONG TO HANG A GOOG BUNCH OF BANANAS! AND THE PRICE of $10.00, IS KIND OF HIGH FOR THAT IN WAL*MART THEY HAVE A MORE STRONG ONE WITH A LONG HANGER AND WELL BALANCE FOR $4.95...SORRYYYYYYY!!!!Sincerely,C.A.St. Louis, MO"
5,"The ""Getting Started with Light and Sound"" book!",This book contains all of the information you need to get started using light and sound technology. The material is presented in an easy to follow format. It is a must for the beginner and a good read for those with some knowledge of light and sound as well.
2,Goofy Movie,I bought this movie thinking it was another movie I had been searching for but it turned out this wasn't the movie so I watched it and thought it was goofy. I actually left the room acouple of times because I got bored.
1,Absolutely horrible product.,"These ink cartridges were awful. I purchased a box of eight, and only the black and blue ink worked.And no refund either. Waste of money."
4,Los Angeles by David Rieff - recommended,"As a native Southern Californian, I started this book with a good degree of scepticism; I finished it thinking it was one of the most engaging, clearly written books on SoCal I had read in years. If you want to understand LA, and its place in the state, and the world, this is an accessible and enjoyable introduction. LA came alive for Rieff in ways that he didn't always immediately understand or anticipate; he translates his own discovery by weaving LA history, anecdotes, and beautiful word pictures together in a clear, engaging style. You may want to read other books on LA after this - and that can only be a good thing. Rieff will encourage you to ask more questions about LA, and what its development means for the future of urban development in America."
4,On The Record,"I am about to start using On The Record in my Reading Course for advanced level. What makes me like the book is the fact that articles focus on current events and so will arouse students' interest, I hope. On the other hand, there are few vocabulary exercises. Certainly the students need more than what is presented. Also, I feel need for more consistent alternatives in the reading comprehension exercises."
5,Measure or be meagre,A practical model of measurment on which HR teams can build up on. A thought provoking primer but should be customized to suit each organization
4,"Great character, great series","I really like the Mercer series. Having said that, I really, really dislike the ""best friend (or family member or significant other) has been kidnapped"" plot device. That made this book a little harder for me to get into than the rest of the series. Leaving out that detail, though, leaves a fast paced adventure any fan of the series (or a fan of adventures like the Dirk Pitt series) will enjoy."
3,What the hell is all the fuss about....,"If you like reading two thirds of a book with no idea why people are dying left and right then this is the book for you.While it starts stong and grabs your interest it lags through the middle as you slog through pages of near death experiences with no clue as to why these things are happening. You just end up confused.If you stick with it (which i did because I am genetically incapable of not finishing a book), it will pick up in the last couple chapters. The ultimate ending however was pitiful, predictable and left you wishing for at least a glimpse of the prize.If you must read this book check out from your local library and save your $$ for something better."
5,THIS 3RD TIME IS GOLDEN,"I gave this book high mark and no doubt it was good; very good. But DuBrul character is somewhat predictable. We know he get the man and do fantastic stunts to save a freind. You just do not mess with Mercer. I suggest to all reader, take a look at his first book on the character to get the backgound stuff on Mercer. The reader can read this 3rd book on Mercer out of order and you will be fine. This is strictly action on a higher James Bond level with the roughness of Pitt from Clive Cussler. If you like adventure with the familar ending, go and get Dubrul. I await the next installment to be frank.I recommend another action book call ICE STATION; his last name is Reilly. This book was very popular in Australia. Go figure.See Ya back here Nov 2000.Tripp"
5,Philip Mercer does it again!,"Great story, if you love Clive Cussler you will love Jack Du Brul (well he has co-written a couple of books with CC!)."
3,Medusa Stone,Good story but a little too long at times confusing. He is a good stury teller but he would be better if fewre characters.
2,Do Not Insult Me,"I have read reviews of other critics, hear me out. I am a historian and Classical Literature degree holder - 2 degrees. It does not take a great deal of imagination or intelligence to write this stuff. If you read/believed in the Dan Brown books, hooked they got ya!. Please dear readers ""historical fiction"" can and should be researched. Check out the overwhelming and salient points. When you do you will find that authors such as this one will go by the way of the dodo bird."
1,burla al comprador,"el cantante mencionado no es el correcto; quien canta, las pocas veces que lo hace e incompletamente, es Mario del Monaco. Esta es una película sobre la ópera de pésima calidad; las arias están cortadas, nada es completo y para colmo, está doblada al inglés de manera pésima. Le di una estrella porque no hay menos. Por favo no la compren, yo cometí el error de hacerlo hace tiempo en New York y todavía estoy decepcionado. Recomiendo grandemente la versión de Pavarotti o la película en inglés de Miller, vista por mí hace mucho tiempo y pedida hoy con gran espectativa."
1,It's not even Gobbi on screen!,"Much to my delight, I managed to find a copy of this video in the used section of a local video/CD store. When I got home and watched the video, I was disgusted. Not only is some other actor playing the title role (while Gobbi just provides the occasional voice dubbing), but several critical cuts have been made to the score - most notably, there is NO PARI SIAMO aria!! Even after only paying [the money] for this film, I felt ripped-off."
1,mix up,"These are two different performances:1) Gobbi and del Monaco, etc2) Gobbi and Filippeschi,etcWhich one is sold here? Reiner Kollrack"
1,"Sadly, this is unreadable junk","Blumetti presents interesting four what if... scenarios. The problem is that he does it so badly that you want to throw the book the away. I'm not a grammar Nazi, but the awkward sentence structure, spelling mistakes, and brain dead language makes this unreadable. I defy anyone to enjoy the Napoleon born in United States scenario. It starts off bad, gets worse and sinks under its own mediocrity. It's hard to explain this, but I'll try: imagine the worst creative exercise story you ever heard badly recited by the dumb kid in your junior high English class... Got it? Good, 'cause that's what you get here.It's amazing that this thing got published.Alternative History can be fun, but this was just awful."
1,"Good history, poor execution","Blumetti seems to have a solid grasp of 19th century European history, and his scenario of a Napolean raised in America is imaginative. However, it appears that his manuscript WAS NOT PROOFREAD by ANYONE before being sent to the printers, with the result that the huge number of grammar mistakes, misspellings, and sentence fragments makes his book almost unreadable."
1,Go for a walk instead,"The basic idea of the book, some alt history scenarios as mind candy for people interested in it, is laudable. However its execution and therefore the book is ridiculous at best, if not outright damnable.Two of the scenarios, 1866 and 1916, are actually quite interesting and would have deserved better, grammatically correct English would have been a first step. Some are downright silly like Napoleon Bonaparte as third president of the US; others are absolute crap and read like the wet dream of an old Nazi.What hurts is the total disregard for facts. To give one example: Napoleon Bonaparte, born in 1769, could not have been a candidate for president in 1804. For that you have to be 40. And so on, and so on ...So my advice for prospective readers: go for a walk instead."
4,The greatest band no one has ever heard of,"I bought a used copy of Mortuus Deus on a gamble, and I was very impressed. The album hits you with a combination thrash/black metal, mixing solid grooves with shredding guitars. Ankhelgloknar's songs have a nice epic feel, and the guitar solos are actually quite mind-blowing. The vocalist has a sinister growl/snarling style, sounding playful, melodic and harsh at the same time. The entire album is essentially a hymnal to some sort of god, ""Ankhelgloknar,"" who represents the triumph of nothingness. Don't let the nihilistic lyrics fool you, though; I think the songs are mostly self-parody, full of over-the-top lines like, ""It will crucify your brain!"" and, ""char... my... booooooones!"" But the music is actually very good, and it's a shame Ankhelgloknar only has one album. If you like metal, then I highly recommend Ankhelgloknar."
5,Have you noticed?,".... Like Pink Floyd's Album ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" Syncs up to the Wizard Of Oz I have recently heard a rumor that Ankhelgloknar's CD ""Mortus Deus"" syncs perfectly to the movie ""Dawn of the Dead"". I would love to ask the band if this is true or not. I love the album and think it is wickedly underrated. Ankhelgloknar Rules! Hail Ankhelgloknar!"
1,Worthless,"The data cable is considered ""unauthorized"" on the K1m KRZR. Also, The cd contains no drivers."
4,The first book. . .,". . .in a charming series of mysteries intended especially for cat lovers.In this volume, we are introduced to James Qwilleran, formerly a top reporter, but struggling to make his way back, following a divorce and a battle with alcoholism. In his first new assignmet, Qwilleran is assigned to cover the ""Art"" beat for the ""Daily Fluxion"" newspaper -- a subject about which he knows absolutely nothing.We are also introduced to the remarkable Kao Ko Kung -- a remarkable Siamese cat belonging to a local art critic. After a rather bizarre murder, the old reporter in Qwilleran comes to the fore and, with the help of Kao Ko Kung (aka Koko) solves the mystery.Gastronomes will love this series of books as much as cat lovers, due to the luscious descriptions of food and drink described.This book is one of the best of the series, and is well worth the time."
5,GREAT READ!,"Being a cat-lover, the word `cat' in the title caught my attention. But, henceforth, when reading a mystery, I'm reading the last chapter first! The end of this tale caught me off guard. Where did that dude come from?Decades ago I read mysteries by Queen and Gardner and enjoyed them but decided no more fiction, just facts from now on. I didn't want to just have fun when I could to be learning new things. Well this particular book taught me plenty about a subject I would have never thought to study. Art. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
5,Purrrfect,I have always liked TV mysteries like Law & Order. There are twists and turns and things aren't always as they seem. I decided one day that I should read a mystery novel. I had noticed on many previous occasions all of the Cat Who... books. I decided that if I should read them than I should start from the beginning. This book is excellent and still remains one of my favorites now that I've read most of them. It introduces you to James Qwilleran (Qwill to most) and Kao Ko Kung (Koko to his friends). This is an excellent and fast read so go get it and enjoy.
4,A Nice Beginning!,"I picked up this book because I happen to like cats, and found it to be a great book for cat lovers and mystery fans as well. Of course, if you read on in this series, you find that many of the books are plotted along the same lines as this one, with the cat(s) saving the day, and sometimes, our hero Qwill's life. A great book!"
3,My wife likes cat books,Wife likes cat books. Wife rules. Wife says she's read it before. end of review.
1,The Cat Who Could Read Backwards,"I though the book was kind of stupid. It dragged on and on. I got bored with it. I guess it's cute for a children's book, but I wouldn't recomment it."
4,light mystery,"It was very interesting to me to go back and read the very first book in this series. We get to see how Jim Qwilleron meets Koko, who we know will become his cat. This is a well-written light mystery. I look forward to re-reading the rest of the series via Kindle."
4,The Cat Who Aged Very Well,"In typical fashion, I read the last book first and then read the first book. And, I must say that Qwill & KoKo have aged VERY well! I've tried this series in the written format and just couldn't get enthused, but the taped version is VERY well read by George Guidall. The mysteries are very convoluted and a little inane, but the cat lore and behavior is inspired. Lilian Jackson Braun gets the feline just right!"
3,Not my type of mystery novel....,"When i first discovered the whole ""cat mystery"" genre, I became curious, so I decided to give this one a try, and listened to the audio version.For a mystery novel, it's unusual in that the mystery doesn't start until about halfway into the book. The author first establishes the characters and we get to follow the main character, Jim Qwilleran as he starts working at his new job, making some new friends, etc. I suppose these parts were occasionally somewhat funny and the characters were interesting, but I would prefer to have the mystery start much earlier.The writing was good but I personally didn't find the story very interesting, but I guess this isn't my type of mystery. It seems to be popular among readers of cozy mysteries, so I suppose I can recommended the book to those cozy mysteries fans who haven't already read it. Readers looking for suspense should look elsewhere."
3,A fun and easy read.,"This was an enjoyable introduction to a really cute series. I find the character of Jim Qwilleran not quite believeable and a little overdeveloped, but other than that the storyline was fun and is a great read for anybody looking for a nice light mystery."
2,CAn't get through it.,"I have attempted to read this 3 times now, can't get past chapter 5. I will stick with my obsession with Janet."
3,If a mystery could be sweet...,"This book was written in the 60s, so a lot of things, like typewriters, press clubs, drinking at lunch, are a part of the story.It's not high literature, but Lilian Jackson Braun wrote sweet stories about a man and a remarkable cat.With 2 small kids, I needed something I could put down and pick up without much thought and this fit the bill."
3,A nice read,"The Book is a nice read for killing time on a flight, vacation or just killing time period. It does tend to read like her other books but hey it's ok to have!"
3,better than average mystery,This is the first book I have ever listened to. I found it to be a pleasant experience but I suspect I would have given it one more star if I had read it myself. Hearing the reader voice all the characters limits the experience: your own imagination gives characters the voices you think they should have. I am interested in continuing the series but I will definately read not listen to the next one.
3,Cat Who?,"This was an enjoyable book. I did love the descriptions of the Siamese Cat - right on the money there. As the ""property"" of a Siamese myself it was funny to read someone else talking about the attitude the cat can show. This book came highly recommended to me by a friend who has every book in the series.The plot was interesting, and I will probably try the next book in the series to see if the characters develop a little more fully, but truthfully I like a good mystery with more to it. This book would be great to get a young person started on mysteries (like I did with Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys)."
5,Entertaining series,I thoroughly enjoy this book series by Lilian Jackson Braun. Entertaining and memorable characters and a delightful plot. Koko is amazing!
4,Addressing the Infinite personally,"Bloom tells his very interesting life story in which he was born in Switzerland (1914), raised in a secular family in Russia and Persia and educated in Paris. He served as an officer and a surgeon in the French army, was a participant in the French Resistance, and finally became a priest. Bloom points out the importance of addressing the Infinite personally. ""There are moments when the sacred writers, for instance, burst out with something which has the quality of a nickname, something which no one else could possibly say, which is made possible only because there is a relationship."" He gives examples of the psalms where the psalmist says things like, ""You, my joy!"" or ""You, the pain of my life!"" Bloom goes on to say, ""When we can address Him with violence, then we have established a relationship of prayer."" The title comes from this quote: ""The day when God is absent, when he is silent - that is the beginning of prayer."""
5,Umbra Clear Acrylic Soap Dish,"This Umbra Clear Acryic Soap Dish is a nice, functional dish. At first glance, you would think it is glass. You should be aware, however, that it is larger than the dimensions given. It is actually about 5.5 inches long and 4 inches wide. If your space is limited, as mine is, this will make a difference. They are so nice that I decided not to return them as we can use them in other places."
5,This is a great book!,"This is a great book for any Catholic. Msgr. Songy obviously appreciates the rich traditions of the Church yet he sees the importance of the Church changing in the modern world and remaining relevant to the people of God. I think he helps to bridge the gap and facilitates a smooth transition between the ""old"" experience of Church and the ""new"" experience of Church. I have enjoyed reading this book. It is both interesting and informative. I will definitely recommend it to my friends."
1,I didn't get it,"I don't know what the big deal is about this game. It looks pretty, but I was totally lost. I had no idea what...I was doing...just wandering around. That kind of ruins the fun of a game for me. It's hardly what I would call an RPG..."
4,a good game for my brain,I played this game when I was younger for hours to no end. Vary entertainig could not wait to solve the next puzzle. Made it close to the end but ran out of time. Had to return it to my friend. Now I finally own my own copy. Myst is still entertaining and fun. I at last made it to the end. Nice ending by the way. I also Enjoyed the sequels.
1,why did i buy this?,"I love puzzles... I mean, I LOVE PUZZLES.But I don't love this.Not only is this game boring, the graphics aren't too great either (even for PS one... my other games look better than this).I think I'm better off playing puzzle games online for free..."
4,tell me,A bang of a movie. So far the best gangsta comedy there is. Althrough I don't get one thing. What is the name or the author of the song where he was trying to wake him up? You know with the weed and the huge speacker... If you know please e-mail me at memorex11218@land.ru
5,High Times,Method Man and Redman are hillarious in this film. Though it isn't for every age group you don't have to be high to enjoy this movie.
4,"It's Red, Meth and Bee!!!",This film is definatly a must see if you like to spark it...I loved it although it has it's slow moments. You have to be in the right mind frame to watch it. But you can't sit here and slam Method Man and Redman for their acting...they are peformers. They did very well in the movie and their lines are hilarious...like I said you have to act like them in order to enjoy this movie...but don't trash cause you're a straight-edge...but mos def a must see...pAeace
5,THIS MOVIE IS CLASSIC!,ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH EVERY TIME I WATCH IT~~~======= ~
2,Could ave bin better,"I've watched this film and thought,I wish I could smoke some of that to lose all sense of reality.It was a plausible enough start but it lost itself in the haze.Methodman/Redman rap,you're no Cheech&Chong."
5,Hilarious!,This was one of the most funniest movies of 2001.It is hilarious from beggining to end.Forget what those movie critics tell you.They would'nt know a good movie if it punched them in the face.Watch this movie.You will bust out laughing.
5,Funniest movie ever created,"This movie is soo funny that u will have to watch it until the day u die. Every single thing is funny in it. Redman and Method man are the prefect blend for this movie. They act a like, and thier personality is so much a like. This movie is 100 times funnier than dumb and dumber, and a litter bit more funny than half baked. This is a classic."
5,An oldie but a goodie,"Lost my copy of this classic. Had forgotten how funny it was. On your next movie night, get baked and enjoy this movie."
3,How High -- Broken hold slot.,I got the movie and the middle part where the cd holds was broken and I was highly embarrassed being that it was a Christmas present and the person called me and told me they thought it was broken. I don't think I'd order from this place again.
3,Alright,The DVD's were in pretty good condition but they came in a clear case; not in the original DVD case. That was incredibly dissapointing.
3,Redman And Method man (The new Cheech and Chong),This movie was a little okay. I supposed to give it 4 1/2 stars because my brother told me it wasn't that funny! It's probably more like 3 stars to me. So i just gave it 3 stars. But redman and method man is on point though. But this movie is not better than Cheech and Chong. And it aint better than that movie Friday. Half baked with Dave Chapplle.....I don't know. It is probably more like this movie but i think it might be funnier then this one. So my brother's got a point! But I like Redman and Methodman though. I just think this movie could do better. But thanks Amazon!Dee K. Smalls
1,really stupid,What is this garbage. Go get cheech and chong. There just ripping them off. They were funny
5,Hilarious,"THis was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Believe me, I have seen it about a hundred times."
1,how high,"... redman and method man kick..., and they're funny, but this movie stunk. the plot wasn't good at all, it was as bad as scary movie, just not quite as crude. they were more crude with words. i guess my sense of humor is dead. gracias senoritas y senors. opposite of hola! (go see mr.deeds instead)"
2,Had its moments but its not worth the money,"Well here is the deal, this movie is just plain bad. The storyline is incredibly dumb. There is really no interesting or different concepts in this film this is basically the naked gun set in a Harvard atmosphere. Unless your a die hard fan of Redman and Method Man or you are entertained by simplistic and just plain silly jokes than go see it. If your expecting a funny movie your looking in the wrong place"
1,where to begin?,1)repeating cliches isnt funny at all 2)crumby idea isnt funny at all 3)actors(WHAT A DISGRACE TO THE TERM)arent funny at all.things that are funny about how high 1)how quickly this became rentable 2)the steady decline of price. thats all.
2,Check Your Brain at The Door,I laughed. I cried. I lost IQ points. I am dumber for having seen this.
3,More than mere stereotyping of black urban culture.,"A staggering triumph of education and artistry, at once a treatise on the medical, historical, philosophical, and spiritual aspects of Ivy League melancholy, a pep talk for fellow sufferers and a meta-fictional challenge leagues more daunting than any Melville or Thomas Pynchon crafted centuries before. Brilliantly staged by Red Man, an actor who will hold an Oscar above his profound head in the not-so-distant future.Ostensibly, the film may appear merely to be a perpetuation of a black urban myth that does more to caricature a generation of young African-Americans than to help them reach a status equal to that of white America. However, the subversive nature of the movie actually brilliantly displays the infiltration and then appropriation by two African-Americans of America's finest institute of higher education, a bastion of white America."
4,"great movie, fair condition","The movie is great if u like movies about pot I guess, but it is very funny. I bought it for my boyfriend and we got it right away. The 1st movie was damaged so sent back and they were really quick and helpful in the whole process but the rreplacement actually did skip once. I've bought probly 35 movies on Amazon.com and never had any problems before. Always very happy. No biggie, only cost's $1.99 at Hastings to have the disc resurfaced anyway. :)"
4,Shockingly funny,"Normally I am not at all a fan of ""stoner films"", the whole idea of drug use, let alone glorifying it in film upsets me to no end, but I have to say that this movie made me fall over laughing! It's very rare to see a movie anymore that can keep you laughing from begining to end, but if you like to laugh this is a great flick. Not for the kiddies however, but definately a shocking surprise to find out that it wasn't another stupid movie your wasting your hard earned money on!Totally worth the price, lot's and lot's of fun! Method Man and Red Man deliver an outstanding preformance comparable to that of Chris Rock and Chris Tucker! I can't even begin to fully explain the hillarity of this movie, you definatly have to see it to believe it!"
3,cheech & chong meet Red & Meth,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""How High"", it presented a simple plot that interjected fast-witted, urban, yet tasteful comedy. The genius stroke of casting key characters with minimal parts such as, (Hector Elizondo as the coach of the rowing team), a friendly ghost (a friend who suffers an unfortunate accident), a low-budget pimp, and a character named ""I need money"", formed part what could easily be described as the best urban comedy since ""Friday"". Method Man and Redman could easily bank on this comedy for future ""hookups""."
3,Ehh... its ok,"This movie was ok. I thought it would be funnier but I guess I expected a little to much. Definatly not as good as Half Baked. This movie was kinda hard to follow and it didnt make much sense but it had a few funny parts in it. If you are lookin for a classic funny stoner comedy, watch Half Baked."
4,You Have To Be A Fan,"If you're not a Method Man, Redman fan then you won't enjoy this movie. They are FUNNY!!! Plain and simple, they are just too funny. If you didn't get the movie, then that means you had no business in going to see it. For all those that wrote negative reviews, go watch some corny movie like ""Castaway"", yeah that was a really good movie. NOT."
1,How Lame,"Don't waste your money on this crap. It is filled with predictable humor and the story line is horrible. I expected much much better from Meth and Redman. Seriously people , this movie is trash. Its a minstrel show with stereotypical dumb pot smoking thugs a stereotypical white hick and a stereotypical asian FOB. This movie is just a disgrace."
1,A work that will no doubt please the self-important...,"... Wittgenstein intelligentsia. The author is so arrogant and pretentious that in one section he proposes to overthrow the empirical discipline of cognitive science by examining the English grammar of the word ""mind"". If the brain is truly not the organ of thinking, as you claim, Mr. Hacker; then I suppose it shall come as no insult to you that I believe *your* mental processes would suffer no loss even if said organ were removed from your skull. This book is trash and should not be read by anyone."
5,As advertised,Bought this to go along with my Weller soldering iron set. Arrived quickly and in good shape. Would order from again.
3,o sabotage eh o cara,"Sabotage was one of the best lyricists Sao Paulo ever saw, and i really only got this album to get some of his stuff, since it's so hard to find stateside.I'm not really all that into metal or techno, so i skipped through a lot of these tracks, so i was pretty much just paying for like 3 songs on the album anyways, but it was still totally worth it""Na Zona Sul cotidiano dificil"""
4,great hat,the trail hat is very effective in protecting the face and neck during the heat of the day and is lightweight and cool to wear.I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Buy all their CDs,"If you have heard one song from this band, I promise you will like the rest of the CD. I do not know a single person who does not like this band after playing one song. I can not wait to see this band live!"
5,Outstanding Photography as well as Naration,"The pictures of those old, beautiful buildings are unbelieveable. We don't see that kind of workmanship today. Just imagine these buildings were done with very primitive tools and material and, yet they withstood all these years. Today every thing is done in a hurry and at a great cost for something that won't last. This DVD is an absolute must have. I can't praise it enough."
1,What a silly little book.,"I can't believe this book was a best seller. Even more, I can't believe I read the whole thing. Here's my nitpicking beef with the premise: this secret cabal is intent in permanently silencing the witnesses to the downed ""weather balloon"" in an attempt to keep the world from knowing we are not alone and breaking out in global panic. The span of time in the book is about a month. Yet in that time there is no panic, there is no exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer, there's nothing! There's nothing because the witnesses aren't saying anything. A few thought the whole crash was a hoax, another few were too embarrassed to say anything for fear of being ridiculed, and the one or two who did tell someone else what they saw weren't believed. There was really no reason for this Organization to go to all the trouble and expense to kill the witnesses off."
1,Paper thin plot and no characters to speak of.,"With no other choice at hand, I picked this book up at a foreign airport. ""How bad can it be?"" I wondered.The answer is bad-- very very bad.The plot is past unbelievable. The characters are cardboard. I am not sure what to even say beyond those two points. By the end, I was only reading with incredulity because I was curious if it could continue to get worse. It could, and did. The ending was rushed and made very little sense.I enjoy a good entertaining thriller as much as the next person. This is not that book. Skip it, unless you are a huge Sidney Sheldon fan."
1,BOOORING,"This guy is called for duty at the supper secret National Intelligence Agency, given a mission `for his eyes only' and the next thing the `hero' does is disclose it to his former boss.It gets better. He teaches American fighter pilots how do down Migs, improving the skills of this already Top Gun trained pilots by 8 fold in 6 weeks. After accomplishing this `minor' feast, he is released to do some other work elsewhere. Why would they like to keep him training more pilots?Even better: in order to find out who the tourists in a bus during a tour where, they don't just ask the driver for descriptions (and names?) or check credit card receipts: they send one person `in person' to track them down, because is very urgent.Boring, ridiculous, infantile. A bad selection I did at an airport before catching a flight. I left the book at my seat."
3,Exciting (if you suspend disbelief),"The story was thrilling as the lead character (US Navy Commander Robert Bellamy) tries to locate all the UFO witnesses. However, it is beyond belief that Robert would not be suspicious when one of the witnesses (the photographer) dies the day after Robert has found him and identified him to his superiors. Robert blissfully continues to find the other nine witnesses, identifies them to his superiors, and then is shocked when his superiors try to kill him also."
1,Sadly dissapointed,"I Love Sidney Sheldon and am a real fan, but felt that this book was curned out with very little thought. He has a vey good writing style and ordinarily has excellent story lines. What happened?? It is almost as if someone else wrote this book!"
3,"OK read, but expect more","I was disappointed in the plot development. Find out who these people are then let us contact them- Right. Was Bellamy such an idiot not to know what would happen? The story line was too predictable, one person leads to one other, etc. And then they leave me hanging as to what happened to Pier (the helpful whore). What about that hand with 6 fingers and 2 thumbs, where did it end up after the carnival man met the snake? How did the alien know to contact Bellamy 2 weeks after the crash instead of 2 days afterwards? Way to many lose ends and stretches for my taste."
4,conspiracy what?,The book was about a guy that that is a Navy Commander and is assigned to interveiw and find 10 witnesses to a weather balloon crash in sweeden but is wasnt a weather balloon it was a flying saucer that was taken and replaced by a balloon. after each and every suspect interveiw they all died.
1,Dear Mr.Sheldon plese dont venture in unknown places...,"The other side of midnight etc was the area sheldon scored, however I dont know how he got the idea of venturing to write on such storyline which was foolishly conceived, but writing was not bad. I think that best is to avoid reaing this book or even writing longer reviews and should be forgotten like it is not there , only message is:1. Mr.Sheldon pleae next time dont do this mistake of writing on such topic, leave it to Baldacchi etc2. As a reader I will never open the sheldon book if it not a love stroy."
3,UFO/sci fi definitely not believable,"I don't read Sheldon for the sci-fi and I think he should stick with what he knows. The male lead in the Commander was a refreshing change. The storyline of UFOs was a little hokey in the beginning and it got worse as the book went on(-2 stars). I enjoyed the suspense and thrill of the chase while the Commander tracked down each of the witnesses and then became the ""Hunted"" in the second book (+2 stars). Definitely kept me interested and reading, but I hated the idea of the aliens and their spaceship. Just not the type of thing Sheldon should be writing about. This book is average for a Sheldon and I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Amazing!!,"Doomsday Conspiracy kept me on the edge of my seat. Believe it or not I finished reading the book overnight, I could NOT put it down!!"
5,It was a great and exciting book,"It captured my attention from the first line all the way to the end. I couldn't get enough, I had to read it all in one sitting because I couldn't put it down."
5,Sidney's Best Book,What can I say? It's the best book I've ever read. Sidney Sheldon is a genius storyteller.
5,Sydney Sheldon at his best,"This book is one of Sydney's best. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you like fiction and the tv show ""X files"", you will thoroughly enjoy this book"
2,Not one of his best efforts by far!,"I found this book very hard to not only follow, but tu enjoy. I found it difficult to continue to read this book, because their are too many other books that are far better. I did finish it, but was not impressed or was enjoyed"
1,Ghastly attempt at SF,"This book is proof that writers unfamiliar with the SF genre should not attempt to write in it. The Doomsday Conspiracy is filled with dated Pulp Sci-Fi cliches that would have any SF author since the 1920's laughed out of print. Clumsy uses of literary ""technique"" and a ridiculously presented ecological ""Message"" make this book one to avoid even for those unfamiliar with Science Fiction. If SF is what you want try Greg Bear or Vernor Vinge instead."
4,I still talk about it,"I never never read Science Fiction! When I read this book 4 years ago, I found that from the first page, I could not put it down. It may be fiction, but it still made we wonder about our government and all the things that are hidden. I really liked this book and I recommend it. It is different from the usual soap opera love stories."
1,You've got to be kidding,"I bought it, so I read it. Every agonizing page. Filled with cliches, stereotypes, unimaginative characters, ridiculous plot twists, 6th grade level writing and a totally unbelievable premise. Are all these reviewers, who are giving this book four or five stars related to Sheldon, or are they simply middle school students having to read a book for the first time? Be warned, if you buy this book for anything other than to start a fire, you'll be incredibly disappointed. I gave it one star, because it was the lowest score available."
5,Relief from Pain,"I have arthritis and was having bouts of excruciating pain when doing work that required a lot of 'mousing.' A friend suggested this trackball as a replacement for my traditional mouse. Within two days, the repetitive motion pain was gone and never came back. I purchased another of these for my home computer and hope never to have to work without it."
3,basic and effective,"These sunnies are used in our spa during extractions when we're using a small diameter of bright light on client's faces. When the light is directly above, these are great but around the edges the light seeps in.They get the job done better than cotton pads and they're the right price but it would be great if they had more curve to them or flexibility on the bit that goes over the bridge of the nose."
1,poor product,"After only a few uses, my trimmer simply stopped working! No, it wasn't the batteries. And I was not within the allotted time frame for returning the defective item, so I am simply ""out"" my money and I am not happy about it! I should be able to receive some kind of compensation for my time and money."
3,"Good shaver, if you can get one that works.","We ordered two shavers. One was D.O.A., but it wasn't worth returning it. The second one was fine, works great and is very gentle on the skin. They have a new, sturdier version of this out now that I found in CVS - it was a nice improvement."
1,Stopped working immediately.,"I changed many batteries and fiddled and fiddled, but it won't work. It was a gift and cannot be returned. They offer no support or replacement options."
2,don't buy,"Its ok, but doesnt hold a charge for long, nor does it shave that well. I don't think I would buy this again or recommend it."
1,not as great as they say,"the item description says it ""erases the hair"" with its special ""micro-technology."" Basically, it is just a tiny electric shaver that works on batteries. They say it works great on facial hair, but seriously, I would NOT use it on my face. It would be a decent product if they didn't falsely advertise."
1,Not A Good Buy,"I received my Finishing Touch Razor last week. Was suppose to get a free compact mirror with the purchase as advertised which was NOT in the box, also the light did not work. Called the company several times, got a different answer each time. Still have the broken razor, out $23.00. Live and learn is my motto now."
1,Hair Remover,I really resent having to travel to the UPS store to return an item that Inever ordered in the first place. Why can't you just ship ONLY the itemsordered? I also would like to know why I'm not getting a full refund of$32.99.
2,Helen W,"I owned 1 of these years ago and liked it. I put new batteries in it and it wont work. I got another from my sister with new batteries and it wont work. About a month ago I ordered a new one and with new batteries, it wont work.I dont want to spend the postage to send them all back if I wont get a reply. Hope you can do something"
1,lousy,"The product worked once when I first received it. The next time I tried to use it, it no longer worked. I checked and replaced the battery, but it simply didn't work. The cost and trouble to return it (and I don't have the the address) is more than the product is worth, but I sure won't buy or do business with this company again! zero stars actual rating - your system required that I put one in to complete"
1,Excessive S/H,"ideavillage charged $27.96 to ship a small one pound box of smoothe aways - completely excessive, and when I called to complain they transfered me to nonexistent customer, now when I call it goes directly to the nonexistent customer service number - they really suck!"
4,Best Personal Bikini Trimmer,"I think this is the best trimmer available. I think you can buy it from ""as seen on tv"" website"
1,Finishing Touch Personal Hair Remover,This is a terrific product. I purchased one for myself several years ago and use it frequently. It is much better than using depilatory creams which can be harsh on the skin. This year I bought several to give as gifts. They are great for the elderly to use.
4,Works Great,"Got this headset for my Nokia 6102. It's far cheaper than from my service provider, for the exact same product. It takes a bit of forcing to get it attached, but works well and the sound quality is good. It's just too bad the phone don't just take standard 2.5mm headsets (there are adapters out there if you want to go that route though)."
5,Unbelievable price!,"I've used a headset exactly like this before and paid $29 for it!Yes this is exactly the same as one you'd buy at a Nokia dealer. I'd recently bought a new phone and really wanted a Blue Tooth. I'd tested several but couldn't decide. As I will never use my phone when driving unless I'm wearing a headset, I decided to go back to the 'trusty standard!' This has an on/ff switch which for me was most important and even works with 'voice tags!' I honestly couldn't believe the price and wish I'd ordered two at the same time. Shipping was fast. Definitely recommend!"
1,Headset did not fit my Nokia phone,"The product description indicated this Nokia Headset was for my Nokia 6085 phone. Unfortunately, upon receipt of headset, it did not fit my phone. The seller kindly refunded my purchase price, so all is well. I'm still attempting to locate the correct headset for my phone."
4,Takes an abue and keeps going....,"This is my first headset and it has taken a lot of abuse from getting stuffed into a bag, jammed inbetween a car seat, and stepped on. Thumps up on it's durability. And the quaity is very good, not great."
5,it works,"it works for about a year, and what else do you want for something that costs less than $5 including shipment? I always order a spare one when current one works, so that i can use it without interuption"
1,Missing piece never received,"The headset works, but no sponge cover for the earpiece. I tried to contact the vendor, but never got a response. Be warned ! What you see on the picture is not what you will receive. So much for good customer service. And I thought Seattle/Bellevue commerce was bad."
2,"FIRST ORDER WAS OK BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER WE ORDERED TWO ADDITIONAL OF SAME PRODUCT, THEY CAME AS DIFFERENT STYLES AND DEFECTIVE","THIS FIRST ORDER OF NOKIA WIRE-phone headset HS-5 WAS OK, BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER WE ORDERED TWO ADDITIONAL OF SAME PRODUCT, THEY CAME AS DIFFERENT STYLES AND FUNCTIONALLY DEFECTIVE.WE EMAILED TO THE SF PLANET, BUT THEY HAVE NOT SENT ANY REPLACEMENT."
1,It doesnt work!,"It only worked for 2 weeks, I dont think I can trust buying any electronics online again!"
4,Good little gadget for hands-off,"I've got a Nokia N75 and got this in order to facilitate answering calls while on the road. While I usually don't like to talk on the cell phone while driving, there are sometimes when you just can't miss a call. This little gadget has been really good w/the ability to answer/end a call via the cord-mounted button, it's been heaven sent. Would've given it 5 stars, if only the radio/music-player sound would've been a bit better."
5,Does the job,"I bought this because my Nokia came with stereo headphones and they usually tangle up more than what I like. So with a mono headset it's just one cable plug it in an go, no cable mess.I even use the radio feature and can use my free ear to keep in touch with the rest of the world while driving, walking, etc."
2,Ear bud wouldn't stay in ear,"My ears are on the small side, and the ear bud wouldn't stay put for very long. Also, the cord felt taut and short. It was unsafe playing with it while driving and not worth the money to return it."
3,You get what you pay for,"The product serves its purpose...and it was a replacement for my Nokia supplied headset which broke. For some reason I never get a good wireless headset hence my preference to the wired one. This was good, only issue I had was the call answer button, it is hard like a rock...I really need to squeeze it. You get what you pay for I suppose."
3,Works Well...,"I bought this product because my Bluetooth enabled phone died and I was at a point in my contract where I couldn't get a new phone for free. I went back to my old Nokia phone, which is actually a great phone, but has no Bluetooth. Since I sometimes use my phone in the car and it is against the law in California to use a hand-held device while driving, I found this little doozie on Amazon. It works well and is certainly a steal for the price! The only problem is that it is a little difficult to connect-you need two hands-so you really need to connect it prior to starting to drive. The earpiece is a little bulky, too. It's still a great little device if you don't plan to leave it in your ear all day!"
3,beach book,"Charlie Priest is such a likable, realistic character, and Mr. Pawson's writing so good, I found myself forgiving him for committing multiple mystery sins. The detective has information not given to the reader, the villain is a character who is not part of the story as a whole, and there's a tad too much coincidence holding the story together. Still, any novel that can make me laugh aloud was worth my time in the reading."
3,Deadly Friends,Another gripping story about Charlie Priest as he goes about solving crime in Heckley. Stuart Pawson's Charlie Priest is an easily liked character and the plots are intriguing and beleivable. I would reccommend Stuart Pawson to any avid crime reader.
5,A Delightful Tale of High Adventure and Roguery,"Though this book was written over 50 years ago and shows its age a bit, I caught myself laughing out loud at least a couple of times a chapter. It is a very funny, ingenious, and engrossing adventure about the dashing Sir Guy in Elizabethan times attempting to recover a confiscated treasure in Russia for a band of misfit investors. Some of it is pure camp, but a great read on a cold winter night, and interesting to catch a glimpse of old Russia before Europeanization."
3,Nice.,"This disk was recommended to me because of my previous purchases, and the reviews pushed me to pull the trigger on the purchase. Waited a year for it to become available... and then finally received it. I hurriedly popped it in to my CD player and was quickly overcome with an overwhelming reaction of... Ehhh. It's nice. Has it's moments. But it really feels like an album made by one guy in his garage. The production values are so-so and the writing seems a bit haphazard to me. Maybe I'm just not getting it. Entirely possible. But I have certainly had more success using the suggestions feature on Amazon."
3,Sure Grow,"We did not see much of a difference n our dogs, while they were on this product. That is why we did not make another purchase."
1,Not for everyone,This is so stupid it boarders on insane a man trying to act like a dog ( a puppy no less ) and being judged for his behavior come on guys you can't be serious really a sad situation gay or not it is just plain stupid ... the hysterical part is these guys are serious about it a really stupid movie ! i would give it a minus 10 if i could
2,Not what i expected,"I put the dvd in , i saw no caption , no discriptionexcept for the scripture . it was all in asl , no interpretation , esepecially if your just begining its hard to grasp it . you have to read the verse or chapter before you begin . thats what i didnt expect ! however it was neat and a great tool ."
1,Disappointed,I didn't realize this was just a one song CD. I heard several other songs on the radio station link that I found this on so just assumed that all those songs were on this CD. Boy was I wrong. I guess it was my fault - not that familiar with this group but was very pleased when I heard all the songs on the radio website so I wanted to order it. I guess I have learned I need to look a lot more closely to the information on the CD's I order.
3,Another Good Mahoney,"As a fan of the story-line, I found this to be an entertaining read. The McKenna story is always a good one. I found the forefront when the author describes how he uses certain characters to be interesting. Mr. Mahoney uses some real life in his work. Always informative stuff. Kinda hard to believe plot, but none the less an exciting book. The dealings with alcoholism, I find to be accurate. Although, make no mistake about it, a majority need the help of others to maintain long-term sobriety. McKenna is a rare breed of drunk who doesn't need help(AA or the like) to stay clean. His inside the head thoughts as the author puts them in print make for some of the best stuff in the book.I look forward to the next book, having read all of the good books by Mr. Mahoney."
4,Edge of the City - Peruvian Terrorist Handbook?,"In 1996's Edge of the City, Dan Mahoney writes of a lengthy Peruvian terrorist drama involving hundreds of hostages, daily demands and a country held under siege. Sound familiar? In the book, the terrorist group is Peru's largest and most deadly, the Maoist Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path. In current real life, the terrorist group is Peru's second largest, the Tupac Amaru. Strangely enough, events and characteristics of the real life hostage siege have closely followed the patterns in the book. Significant planning was involved; hostages are exchanged frequently for items of need; a propaganda tape was released to the world press; the terrorists are reported by freed hostages ""not to be such bad guys."" In addition to reading like a terrorist's handbook, Edge of the City is a taught, suspenseful terrorist thriller that bristles with the gritty integrity of New York's finest detectives"
2,wrong edition,This was the first time I used Amazon to buy my textbooks. A picture of the 9th editions was advertised. When I received the book it was the 8th ediiton. I was under the impression I was recieving the correct item.
2,Poor design,"Plenty of power; plenty of suction. The problem is the little belt that transfers the power to the brush in the head. The shaft from the motor spins so fast, friction on the belt causes the shaft to get hot, the belt to get hot, the belt to split and break, because after all, that is what rubber does when it gets hot.If you want to pick up a spill, ok. Do a few stairs, maybe a flight, ok. But any more than that, you will be replacing the belt very frequently!Belts are cheap; so is this product."
1,Problems with this hand vac,I purchased the Sidewinder Hoover vacuum back 1/31/2011 and purchased it specifically for my carpeted stairs. I have used it maybe 5-6 times since I purchased it and I used it the other day and it started smelling like burnt rubber. I used it again today and within 30 seconds I could smell the burnt rubber smell....I opened the small rubber cover in the front and it shows the rubber belt going around a metal pin.....I touched this pin and OOUCH! it was so hot it burnt my finger.I had this same hand vac I purchased about 10 years ago and never had a problem like this before.It is way too late to return this item :(
4,Hoover Sidewinder,Works as advertised. Nice long cord. Only thing missing is a built in hook or something similar to store the cord when not in use. There is no easy way to store the cord as designed.
4,Sidewinder a winner,"This hand held, corded vaccuum was recommended by a friend--it is lightweight, powerful, easy to use, picks up dog hair, crumbs, etc. I bought it specifically for use on staircases--it's wonderful."
2,Not impressed,"The Hoover sidewinder I purchased was used for the carpeted steps in my home. On the first use, the rotating brush stopped working and the machine began to smoke. When I called Hoover unsatisfied, they refused to take the machine back and told me to go get it serviced. I did this, and on the second use I had the same problem. The suction was great, but the brush kept getting stuck. I had to manually get it rotating after vaccuming each step. I once again was told to get it serviced....the service man said that the belt was stretched out. I was shocked that after 2 uses it needed a new belt.I am so unhappy with this product and with customer service of Hoover. Obviously the machine is defective, and yet they won't refund my money or exchange the product."
3,Hoover Sidewinder Hand Vac,"If you have pet hair on your furniture, this is the hand vac for you. The beater brush feature is indispensible for removing stubborn cat or dog hair from cushions while it ""beats"" the dust out for the vacuum to suck up. It has a nice long cord and the power head can swivel sideways to reach difficult places. Be careful about getting your fingers caught in the spinning brush when turning the head and locking it into place, however."
2,"oh, that rubber band in the nozzle","During the second use we smelled the burning rubber. The rubber band in the nozzle moved aside and blocked the rotating brush. Not a problem, we adjusted it. But it keeps moving back and blocking the brush every 20-30 seconds! Extremely annoying."
5,Super,This is an excellent little vaccuum. I have had two of them. Only drawback is finding replacement parts.
3,Okay for kids,I wasn't very impressed with this CD. It's harder to sing along for my child. She doesn't seem to interested in singing along to this CD. I was looking for a good Christian Christmas CD for my child and this wasn't really geared towards my small child.
4,Soothing and relaxing CD!,"I heard about this CD, along with a few excerpts, on NPR, and purchased it a few weeks later. I was very touched by Zucchero's story. If American musicians from Eric Clapton to BB King are fans, I had to hear him myself. And now I am a fan, too. I love having music like this in my collection. The sounds are relaxing and engaging without being overwhelming, and the collaborations with people like Sheryl Crow, Sting, and Mile Davis have a great mix of classic and new. I love it, and I hope it eventually gets the attention that it deserves!"
5,The Italian blues man,This is an excellent album and one that will have you tapping your feet and dancing in your mind. Enjoy it!
5,Best Italian cross over Musician!!!,Excellent quality and contemporary sound.A little of Gospel a little jazz and a little rock mixed with Italian spice makes it all nice~ I especially love the Pavarotti and Bocelli contrasts with Zucchero throaty performance. It makes buying this album worth its weight in GOLD!!!!
5,Nice but NOT perfect,"The purchase & shipment process was uneventful. The last tracks of the CD skipped...no visible scratches...tried different CD players...same. Initiated the Amazon.com return process & requested a replacement CD. All of that went as advertised...no problems. BUT, the second CD was identical...last tracks skipped. Dumped 90% of the album into Ipod Nano...i can deal with 90%."
3,"Fairly cute, but not a favorite","First of all, let me say that I love the use of primary colorsin the illustrations. It is definitely appealing to the eye. Second,most of the rhyming and cadence of the story was uniform. There was one spot, however, that was very awkward to say. Crosissants and conference did not rhyme and made the page an awkward addition to the story. That being said, overall I did like the book. Penelope Jane is a cute character and my daughter liked her antics at the school when she got into so much trouble. Penelope Jane also became a hero dispite her tiny size by using her brain, which is a good lesson for children. However, this is not a book that I liked well enough to read over and over."
3,Too Bad the Story Isn't as Cute as the Illustrations,"One certainly should not judge this book by it's cover. While the illustrations and even the title itself are quite darling, the story leaves a lot to be desired. It was almost as if the author was more concerned with making sure the text rhymed than with the actual contents of the story. I was left feeling disappointed."
1,forget this from Amazon,"I ordered 4 of these for my deep kitchen cabinets....They arrived promptly and ALL 4 WERE BROKEN. They are made from plastic and although they are sturdy they are delicate because of the ball bearings. They were packaged poorly in a very large box, with a lot of room to shift during transit. Thus none survived and there was no hope for repair. I subsequently found them in a container store...for less money and they knew how to wrap them so they would not shift or knock against each other. I am now using them in my cabinets and they work just fine."
4,works,"big, round, spins well... what else do you want? it has a fairly low profile, so it doesn't eat up too much of a shelf's height."
1,you get what you pay for,I didn't realize that this would be defective...it was listed as new but clearly was not. It does not spin properly. Very disappointing.
5,Acrylic Lazy Susans,"Great product! Great company to purchase from! I had an problem with one of the three that I bought, when I called they promptly sent a new one to replace the imperfect one!"
3,Emt refresher,The book was in great condition and the price was excellent. The only problem was the info in the book wasnt accurate or consistant with the course I took online here in Florida.
1,Disappointed,"It took me several minutes to plug in the 10-pin connector to my D200, and -- like another reviewer here -- I was worried I was breaking something; a lot of forcing going on; it never felt like it connected properly.Once I did make the connection, the wireless would only work from 3ft away or closer. And even then, it worked maybe 20% of the time. Most of the time I actually had to -touch- the remote to the wireless receiver to make it work, which of course defeats the purpose of having a wireless.I'm happy other reviewers here had an easy time with it; but man I wish I could get my money back on this one.Flickr has a small user discussion on this wireless as well. Search for ""d200 wireless shutter release"". Some got it to work, and most had trouble getting the plug to connect."
2,No Reliable Experience,This item failed to trigger on critical family pictures on several occasions. Works only if a few feet from the camera. Cheap design & construction.
1,Most useless dog in the world,"The receiver will receive the signal within the radius of a funnel approximately 6 inches tall and 4 inches diameter directly above the green light. Oh sure I lied. It does better than that. This is what I did. Hooked the sucker up to my D200. Pressed, nothing, pressed again, nothing. Go up closer, nothing, and nothing, and fired! Wow! Ok, I put the magic wand (antenna) very close to the receiver, click, fired, click fired. I move the wand away, nothing, moved back, fired! I now wave my wand slowed following the obit of an imaginary cone projected from the green light and it fires every time within approximately 6 X 4 inches.I changed batteries twice, my luck did not improve.Did I get a bad unit? Did anyone else have a different experience?"
1,I didn't like it!,They made the game too hard to be having fun. The animals are way too picky about everything. There is no good sandbox level to play. I just didn't enjoy it. All in all I didn't have fun with this game and would not suggest you buy it.
2,Not the item pictured,"This item is not the one displayed in the photo. The ball has ""traditional"" white stripes versus the black stripe across the middle. The striping, however, is not the issue. The bad thing about this ball is that it is much slicker than the composite ball with the black stripe (currently being used in my league in NY). The black stripe ball is very very tacky. This ball is slick vs tacky. I recommend you purchase from somewhere that has the black stripe ball."
3,Not good,It was a footbal so it was ok but it did not look like the one in the picture which is the one that we really wanted.
1,Do not purchase,It looks like this years model was produced by a different manufacture. It has a some sort of slippery film coating. This makes the ball harder to grip and use during games. I do not recommend using this product till this is fixed.
1,very disappointed,"I bought two of these for my granddog because it said they were so ""indestructable. Well They were not! She didn't play with it for more than four hours when she broke it open. When you have a pitbull and she's tough on toys, you try spend extra for a quality product. This is NOT!"
1,Lasted Less Than A Day,"I purchased this item for my German Shepherd Dog. The ball lasted less than 1 day, it's already broken in half and is in the trash. I would not recommend this ball, it doesn't stand up."
5,A BIG HAPPY for PUP,"MY 8 mo. old , 60 lb. pup loves tennis balls but they kept getting caught in small spaces & then he would paw at it frantically or come get me, over & over to get it out.This ball is just enough larger that it rarely gets caught anywhere so he & I have more peace and play without looking for a lost tennis ball.One caution, this ball is proportionately heavier than the smaller tennis ball size. It hit me 1 day during a game of fetch & was surprisingly ""tuff.""So: great for big dogs but not little dogs or little children.We haven't had it very long but I think it will be much more durable than a regular tennis ball."
1,not very 'tuff' at all,This ball didn't even make it an hour. First the halves split and then the ball ripped apart. Seems to me they must be using some type of water soluble glue. It got wet and practically fell apart.
2,Not so tuff....,"We have two German shepherds. Holly is always good to her toys, Kira on the other hand.. always ruins everything we give her. This only lasted about two days before she split it in half. It also seemed a little too big for their mouths. They had a hard time adjusting to it. I've since ordered kong balls, the normal kong we got a few years ago is still in good shape. I'm sure a kong ball will be a lot better then this.So:If your dog normally doesn't ruin balls, this will work.If your dog ruins everything, get the kong ball instead!"
4,Dumping the skater dude,"C.J. Logan knows all the moves on and off the skateboard. Hand in the back pocket, whispers in the ear and hair pulling gets the girl everytime. It sure worked for Kelsey. But after a year Kelsey grows tired of playing second string to the skateboard, so she dumps him. When she comes home from summer with her dad and checks CJ's blog she finds something she never expected. He writes that he dumped her because she was a Total Sex Fiend. Of course, everyone believes C.J. and Kelsey is left to find her own idenity, who she is when she's not CJ's girlfriend."
2,Not the best,"I purchase this item before it was associated with Pinnacle from a retail store. Unfortunately, I didn't try it out before the warrantry ran out which is something I REALLY REGRET. The audio capture is choppy 8 out of 10 times and those stats don't cut it when you spend over $250. The support from Dazzle at the time was almost non-existent. We were told to try different setting instead of the one that matched our brand (as if we didn't try that). Now that Pinnacle has bought Dazzle they don't even list this item on their website. If I were you I would invest in a DV camera with the firewire instead of this because it will bring you nothing but HEADACHES when you want to use it."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk, Junk!!!!!!!!!","I finally got around to opening this product and connected it to my ""new Emac."" My Mac is very good at automatically recognizing plugins via fire wire. The doggone thing just don't work! I did trouble shooting both through mac and pinnacle systems online website. All I have now is a $200.00 statue! Don't waist your time or money on this junk."
2,Not Impressed,Reversible swivel on belt completely broke after less than 7 months of casual use. Also flaking of plastic around belt holes. Do not recommend if you want something that lasts.
5,uniform,"What a wonderful product, it comes very large and shrinks a lot so people should take that into account when purchasing this item, I love it!"
5,Theology of the Biblical Witness: An Evolutionary Approach,"The book as with the other is intended for a theological student in China. I read it before sending it own.Thank you for the speed with which the book arrived, in excellent condition as you indicated. The letters we receive from the students make it all worthwhile."
5,such a sweet movie...,This was such a sweet movie that I purchased it as a Father's Day gift for my dad. He loved it too! Great gift idea.
5,Ahahaha,This movie is so much fun for all ages! It really has you laughing and cheering for more. I wish they would have made a sequil!
4,"Wonderful movie, poor quality video.",It would have been five stars except that there were a couple of minutes in the video that were quite blurry. The original play won the Pulitzer Prize back when it really meant something. It's the ultimate feel good movie and a happy experience. All the characters are so colorful and even the small roles are gems. Josephine Hull stole the show and Jimmy Stewart did such a great job in his role. It was if the playwright knew both of them and wrote the original for them.
5,Classic movie,"I love this movie. The only thing we cannot figure out is why this DVD version doesn't show Harvey briefly. We all remember seeing this movie long ago and at the end Harvey very briefly appears. Did they edit this out? Other than that, a classic that makes great entertainment."
5,"""Let me introduce you to my friend Harvey""","Guess what? I'm 15 years old. Why would such a ""punk"" review a movie from the 50's? Because it bloody well deserves it, THAT'S WHY! I saw this movie on TV one time and I laughed myself silly! James Stewart was apparently a great actor and did a hell of a job making me laugh. Sure it's black and white, sure it doesn't have all the special effects that a ""stupid kid"" like me would get into, but I know a really funny movie when I see one. I recommend it to everyone."
4,An Old Classic,"You know this show is remarkable. It is slow, eccentric, and sometimes downright goofy, but due to the strong acting of Jimmy Stewart and others it somehow holds your interest. One thing is sure. It is memorable. I think I only saw part of it once before probably 25 years ago on a station that showed a lot of old movies, but I never forgot it and always wanted to see it again, this time in its entirety. I finally decided to find it on Amazon and purchase it. It was only then that I found out it was based on a successful and long running Broadway play and that James Stewart often starred in those presentations. I would like to give it 5 stars on uniqueness alone, but I don't think it is something I would watch again and again like ""It's a Wonderul Life."" Still don't let that dissuade you from watching it. It's worth seeing even if you watch it only once or twice in a lifetime."
3,Not sure what I think about this movie,"I had a list of movies to watch about people with disabilities, and this was on the list. I had never seen it before, but know it is considered a classic. I did enjoy Jimmy Stewarts portrayal of a man who believed he had an invisible giant sized rabbit as his pal. He was very good. But the premise of the story is so unrealistic, at least in todays world. I don't know how mental illness was treated in that era, but if people could be committed so easily, it was tragic, scary, and very sickening. I didn't like the person who played his sister...she was whiny and just crazy herself...too much for me. Again, this is a classic movie, but it is not my favorite."
3,Follow the rabbit?,"This review is for video quality of the blu-ray only. You can check the other reviews for their take on the movie itself.Let's cut to the chase: the quality of the video is passable but not great. From the other side of the room, it looks crisp. But when you get closer, there is a good amount of film grain present. It does not appear that the film has been remastered or restored. The blu-ray looks about the same as an upconverted DVD. So if you already have the DVD, you might just want to stay with it--at least until Universal comes out with a restored/remastered version."
5,a must have classic,Every generation in my family watches this together. hilarious yet warm. Jimmy Stewart at his best along with a fabulous cast.
5,Great film!,"I love this movie. I am a big Jimmy Stewart fan and he is so good in this. It's an old film, done in black and white and if you like this genre you'll enjoy this movie."
5,I Reject Your Reality and Substitute My Own! Recommended!,"We have been showing classic movies to our kids and Harvey was a great addition. Jimmy Stewart puts in a fantastic performance as Elwood P. Dowd (""Let me give you my card""), an affable alcoholic who happens to believe that he has a Pooka for a drinking buddy. Just as for clarification, a Pooka is a mischievous spirit that manifests itself as a giant animal, in this case a 6' 3.5"" white rabbit. Mr. Dowd's main problem is that only he can see Harvey and the rest of his family is relatively sure he is quite committable, mostly because he insists on introducing Harvey to everyone he meets, which has humorous (and socially disastrous) results.In addition to Stewart's great performance, there is a great supporting cast but especially Josephine Hull (a great performance as Aunt Veta) and Peggy Dow (the beautiful nurse Kelly).This is a classic that shouldn't be missed! Highly Recommended!"
4,What a precious piece,"I had heard about this movie, actually my parents had talked about it a couple of times, but I really had no idea what it was about. I finally saw it and, boy, what a cool movie!Nicely directed by Henry Koster HARVEY demonstrates great imagination, something that I'm starting to notice with newer films today. It was written with sensitivity by Mary Chase and Oscar Brodney.James Stewart in the lead role is just great. He always was in all of his movies.This one was a special imaginative undtertaking"
5,"Harvey a funny heart warming movie, truly a classic","I watched this movie with my son (who is 24 years old) and his friend. We all were laughing all the way through the movie and it was a great movie with a mixture of comedy and a heart warming feel. It was great for all, even my son who had never even heard of the movie. James Stewart was great."
5,There is no one like Jimmy Stewart!!!!,I became a huge Jimmy Stewart fan when he died because they gave all his movies on TCM. I saw this movie and it made me feel so warm inside and happy to be alive. I appreciate these great classic movies even though I'm only 17 and I think everybody should buy these movies especially if they're Jimmy Stewart movies.
5,Pooka of a movie.,"Just saw the movie which I remember seing as a little girl(A long time ago).I can only say it is a TIMELESS classic.You, begin to believe in Harvey!The commentary from J.Stewart was good too.Also learning that the story was penned to relieve a neighbour's sad loss of her son in WWII war was quite touching. The acting was faultless from Elwood P Dowd to his lovable sister and the ""Nut house "" doctor who pleads to haveHarvey for himself. It is fantasy whith astute human's behaviour observed.As Mr Stewart remakes ""I tried smart now I prefer nice"".The movie brings to mind who is sane and who should be locked up.Millie"
3,Shipped damaged!,"The DVD disc itself was in good shape, but the movie was obviously shipped damaged. The DVD case was crushed on the right hand side so badly, it needed to be replaced. It still had shrink wrap on it and was shipped in the proper shipping container. There was not a mark on the box itself and there was sufficient packing material. It was necessary to purchase empty DVD cases to replace the one shipped."
1,Trouble staying awake,Can't understand what all the fuss is over this movie. It's cute but so boring. I could hardly stay awake.
5,harvey,This has always been one of my favorites. Even Jimmy Stewart said that this was his favorite movie to make.
5,Jimmy Stewart at is best,"I have watched this movie a million times over the years and it is never any less endearing then the first time I saw it. Jimmy Stewart as at his finest in this movie. He originated the role on the stage and there could never have been a better actor for this role. If you like Jimmy Stewart, or simply miss the good old days of film, this is a must-have for your collection."
5,that funny jimmy stewart,great fun about a very tall bunny based on a play also about a very tall bunny
4,Harvey,The internet streaming quality was great. It was wonderful to be able to view a classic film like this in such high quality resolution in such a convenient format.
3,....,"Please stop colorizing the classics. It totally ruins a masterpiece. I'm surprised the black and white part of ""The Wizard of Oz"" wasn't colorized as well. I love ""Harvey."" It's a fantastic movie. Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor of all time. I just wish they'd left it alone. Colorizing a movie doesn't make it better. In fact, it cheapens it, if it was originally in black and white. I came on this site looking for ""Harvey"", but when I saw that it was in color, I passed on it. I'll wait and see if they decide to rerelease it in it's original classic splendor."
5,Harvey,"This is by far my favorite movie. I have never seen a more family-friendly or wholesome movie. I would recommend it for all ages, or any who can appreciate the good ol' days."
4,"WAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!! it's so beautiful, I can't help crying!","The movie Harvey is about a man (Jimmy Stewart) who imagines a giant bunny named Harvey. What follows is an odd, sometimes humerous plot that will leave you in tears. I saw this movie alone and by the end, I was bawling and remembering my stuffed bunny from my childhood. WARNING: you may cry during this movie. Make sure you get some tissues before it starts!"
5,my favorite family movie,I watched it for the first time when I was 21 and single.I've watched it through the years.Now I watch it (and own it) with my kids and family (I am 41) and the magic still remains.This movie has magic. Josephine Hull is unforgettable.
5,Perfect and timely!,Ordered this movie as a gift -- it was packaged lovely and sent right away. My mother loved it and I wouldn't definitely buy again!
3,From Back Cover,"On a sultry midnight eve, Dr. Shane Fortune came face-to-face with his past. For his 'intruder' was the woman he'd once loved but foolishly let go. Now Cynthia McCree and her son were his reluctant houseguests. He reasons for being under his roof were no secret. One that had to do with her son.. who bore an uncanny resemblance to him!3rd in Fortune's Children: The Grooms series"
3,Good start,"I used this book in an introductory course to arts management. Though it can be very dry, the book is a useful base. However, if you can find the same information with a little more personality, I would take it."
1,Regular Amazon Shopper,"Seemed like a quality product when I purchased. However, after one use on a 2,000 mile trip seams began to separate and come apart. Unfortunately I purchased over a year ago and did not use until our last trip or I would have returned it. I would not purchase unless you only plan on using it on one trip."
2,Looks super cheap. Is this authentic Rola?,I returned the bag without using it. The bag did not match the numerous photos of the Rola bag. The shiny vinyl material is identical to a blow up toy material. I am sure its waterproof but thats not what I was lead to believe what I purchased in the picture. I don;t know if its a cheap imitation or whether Rola actually change their design. To bad. Mine is shiny black plastic material like was shown by other review.
3,Good Bag,"Overall a good bag. Used with hatch cargo carrier on my Pilot. Believe or not, it was waterproof. Drove 6 hours in heavy rain, the items stayed dry. The only con is that zippers hard to close because of rigid overlapping protective layer and square shape of the bag. Eventually the protective layer was ripped at the back corner. However, if one will be careful when closing zippers it could be prevented. Can not figure out how to fix it: tape and glue did not help. The straps are too long and plastic rings are weak. Used additional heavy duty straps to be safe. Very spacious when expanded, however, when expanded, the bag closes the view to the rear number plate, wondering if police will stop."
4,Great cargo bag.,"I used this bag for a road trip on the day that I received it. It opens and mounts easily. I put two large ruffles, two medium suit cases, two boogie boards, and a few other small items in it. It seals up pretty well and kept everything dry/clean during our drive on the highway in rain."
5,Great Bag!,"This is a great exterior travel bag. It arrived fast and problem free. It seems to be very strong and holds a lot of items. It is completely waterproof as I drove from South Carolina to Connecticut,14 hours in mostly heavy rain and luggage was totally dry. Fits on the car carrier perfect and straps down securely. Very happy with this purchase. Thanks!"
5,Great,"Enjoyed keeping things dry and clean when winter driving.If I could improve anything, I would want a heavier thickness to avoid punctures and tears.The bolts on the carrier made small holes taking the full bag in and out.I can't complain about performance for the price. Glad to have it."
4,Cargo Golf Club Carrier,The cargo bag is great--BUT--I use it for golf clubs--build a frame out of PVC pipe to insert in the bag to give it some stability--use bungie cords (not the straps) to secure bag to carrier rack.
2,Cargo carrier cover,"It's OK. The material is good and sturdy but the zippers are sometimes tough to open and close and the straps are a nuisance, we used bungi cords instead. Also If you can't close the zippers all the way for any reason the bag collects water when it rains and is difficult to take out to empty because you have too remove everything that is in the bag and in our case it is a generator. When I need to replace this I will do so with a simple tarp, I wouldn't buy it again."
1,WET TRIP--DRY BAG,"I JUST FINISHED A 2000 MILE TRIP AND ENCOUNTERED TORRENTIAL RAIN AND SOME SNOW AND THE ROLA BAG STAYED BONE DRY, INCREDIBLE!!"
4,Good Rola cargo bag!,"Not a bad bag...does the job well and is expandable...comes with straps to keep everything in place...My only issue, which wasn't really a huge deal, was I thought this would be a bit heavier/more substantial canvas feel. This has more of a thin rubbery skin than a heavy canvas gym bag, say...I know, I know...it's water-proof which is great...Just sayin', I thought it would be a bit heavier-weight...All in all, 4 stars...good product...buy it!"
3,functional but not aesthetically appealing,Actual product does not seem to match the external texture of the product as seen in the product's picture. The material looks like the surface of an inflatable rubberized bed. Hope it satisfies the function it was intended to do...be able to load as much big and small outdoor stuff.
3,Seems perfect,I have not yet used this product. We got it in preparation of our Christmas trip to Minnesota. The size is perfect for the cargo carrier that we purchased. It appears to be made from quality material and it came with tied down straps to attach to the carrier. We believe that this will be an idea solution for a weather proof container for our items that will not fit in SUV.
5,Excellent Cargo Bag,"We bought this in July 2012 for a 3-week to California and Oregon. We stuffed it with camping gear and it performed with no problem. We took it again on a trip to California over Christmas. The rain poured and poured. It snowed. We had all our Christmas gifts in the bag and, you know what, it kicked ass! Everything was dry!! It's easy to attach and remove."
4,Nice Bag,"I don't know why I thought this was a canvas bag, I should have read the description. Either way, this is vinyl/plasticky kind of material that itself is waterproof. The straps are plentiful and great for cinching it down to my hitch mounted cargo basket. My only concern is the ends are stitched into the top of the bag. I was afraid to cinch it too tight for fear of over-stressing this contact point. I also have the same concern about over-stressing the zippers on a large load. At least the zippers are bigThe buckles/straps come completely unassembled, so you have to thread them through the buckles (the right way and in the right direction to get them to cinch properly). This takes awhile, but once you connect them to the bag, you can leave them in place for your next trip. Its nice having everything in a bag you can tie down, no worrying about if every individual item is strapped properly ..."
4,Excellent product,"I have a sports car with no room for luggage, so a good solution was to add a receiver hitch and use a luggage rack. My main concern was securing the luggage and keeping it clean/dry. This bag worked like a charm. At first I wasn't crazy about the fact that it is, well, a bag. I wanted something more box like because I figured it would be a pain dealing with a floppy bag. Once you get a few items in it there's really no hassle and the fact that it can expand means you can always fit a bit more. A+"
5,6000 Miles,"I bought this bag to carry my camping gear across country this past summer and I must say the bag was incredible except after 5 days it came apart at seam near the bottom which I had to duct tape. I did over 6000 miles with this bag going through heavy rain and dust and everything remained dry. The bag started peeling near the end of the journey, but I am not sure if I recieved a bad bag or I over stuffed it. I left a comment asking for warranty service on the company website and they responded quickly and even gave me another bag as a replacement. I highly recommend this bag even with the issues I experienced because of the punishing I gave it and the outstanding customer service."
2,Bag,I don't like how it opens .but it seam still to small for what I need also.great water proof. One of ties broke when hooking to bag.
5,Best bag ever!,"This bag was worth every single penny. First, it is HUGE! I cannot believe how much it holds--almost like the Harry Potter magical tents--I just add stuff and add stuff and add stuff.Lots of places to tie it down to my trailer platform as well. Only thing I don't like about it is the placement of the tie downs in front mean I have to loosen them every time I want to get into the bag--I wish the tie down was under the zipper instead of over it.Talk about waterproof! I have been through several DRIVING rain storms, one so bad I almost had to pull over because I couldn't see to drive. Not a single drop made it into the bag.I am totally impressed with this bag--it not only lives up to it's claims, it exceeds them. I have recommended this bag to lots of folks!"
5,Used a ton and still in great shape,Don't know how many times I've used it but it has to be starting to add up. Still in great shape and does exactly what I bought it to do. Handles the rain and snow fine and everything inside stays dry.
2,Item not as pictured,"Same as another reviewer, we also got a bag that was made out of a heavy vinyl / plastic like material. It was not the same material as pictured. I am confident that it will be waterproof but I am concerend about the flexibility of the material in the winter. The zippers are very cheap and after only zipping it up once, one of the teeth broke off and we did not even have anything in it. The bag will not fold up very well because of the stiffness of the vinyl. We had wanted to keep in the the back of our van in the storage compartment until needed but it just won't fold up small enough to fit. Overall the bag is OK but I feel I did not actually get what I thought I had ordered. I will replace it with something else when it wears out."
5,Great Quality Bag,"This bag is the best I have ever seen or used. Very durable, awesome zippers, etc.Again, this bag is the best!"
2,Oops,"I did not like this book as much as I expected to. I admit to having been *really* looking forward to reading it. But I ended up not caring much for what I read.It's hard to say specifically why I disliked it. It may be that (like ""The Vagina Monologues""), this material works much better in performance. But I think it alse had to do with the odd confluence of academic writing with prose that was clearly intended to be something else entirely. I kept wanting to think that these dissonances I was experiencing were intentional and that they had some kind of meaning. But in the end, I couldn't find one.Another issue I had was that the book seemed really deeply rooted in heterosexuality. Which is fine, except that it seemed like the author was trying to be more universal.Finally, I lost interest. This is one of the few books I have failed to finish reading. And I don't expect to return to it later. In fact, I have already given it away to someone else who said she wanted it."
1,Very Disaspointed- NOT Dishwasher Safe!,"I have been looking everywhere for heavy-weight flatware with black handles. I saw the same set in the pure stainless version (no black) & was so excited to find this black-handled version on Amazon! I bought three sets so I would have a service for twelve. The flatware very heavy and seems to be well made. Now comes the big disappointment: After the first two washings in the dishwasher, the finish on the handles started to unevenly peel off. The manufacturer advertises this set is dishwasher safe & there was no mention of any sort of protective coating. I have a top of the line Maytag dishwasher & only use Cascade soap. If you plan to hand-wash the flatware, there is probably no problem. Just don't plan to run it through a dishwasher!"
3,Helpful,"Contemporary American Poetry should be seen as a great tool in learning the basics of writing poetry. I believe that in order to be well written, one must be well read, Contemp offers readers the ability to read and recieve some tips from some great writers. Whenever I am having a slow day thinking of something to write about, I pick up Contemp."
5,Learn and laugh the deductive way,"What a fun and family friendly way of making your brain grow. As a homeschooled family we're not always home so we keep this book in the car and everyone participates. The helpful guide at the beginning explains how to get the children to think in a deductive way rather than just guessing the answer, The answers at the back will surprise you. When the older children think they have the answers they then can ask leading questions until the younger ones get it as well. While it is probably meant for an overhead projector, the quality of the questions are well worth it. Time in the car melts away as the kids learn and laugh."
2,These exercises are confusing,I bought this for my 11 year old-son the year we home-schooled. We found most of these to be way over his head (and mine). It's hard to solve the puzzles based on the information given - but then I've never been a candidate for MENSA either.
4,Great Game,"I love tom and Jerry! This game is great! It has many levels and it is not too easy and not too hard. Just ignore the other people who rated it... THIS GAME IS GREAT!A total keeper I have 15 gameboy games and I love this one the most.It is durable, and great for all ages!The fact that it is a cartoon show too makes it even more attractive! If you get hooked[which you will, I know I did!]you should watch the show on the cartoon network channel#65, on at 11:00 and 1:30. The TV show rarely uses words but you will get hooked on both of them. my suggestion is during the commercials play the gameboy version of it!Funerific!Definatly worth the money!"
4,Comfy and stable!!,"These are quite comfy and you hardly feel like you are wearing a higher heel. I got this shoe in a narrow width, so my foot wouldn't slide through. The first day it did give my pinky toe a blister, but then the leather ""gave"" and the second time I wore it, it was fine. Nice look and very comfy."
4,COMFORTABLE SHOE,"THESE SHOES ARE SO COMFORTABLE, I WAS ABLE TO WEAR THESE SHOES ALL DAY WITH NO PAIN."
4,Rockport sandals,I got these shoes for relatively little money off Amazon and I really like them..They're comfy and good looking. I would recommend them to anyone interested in a casual sandal.
5,Implementing Win 2000 technolgies in the real world,"This book is about implementing the new technologies of Win 2000 in the real world. The author's exposure and experience in the industry makes this book full of tips in practical implementation. Despite being a Win 2000 MCSE myself, I am enjoying and immensely benefiting reading this book as I go by its pages.This one sails you through executing the new and difficult-to-implement technologies of Win 2000 like IPSec, NAT, DNS, Certificates services, Terminal services etc. through its nice walkthrough(s). Even basics like MMC have been explained in great detail. Such detail work e.g. devoting 63 pages to IPSec definitely helps concept building.In summary, an excellent book for the dollars you pay. I hope the author soon attempts a book on Configuring Win 2000 with Active Directory: I for one will keenly look forward to it."
5,interesting,"This book is great for people who are interested in rock and roll history. I learned, unfortunately, how tragically some musicians lost their lives. Some committed suicide or were murdered; others were killed by car or plane crashes; for others drug and alcohol took over their lives. This is a quick read. And, I admit there are some names that I believe shoudn't have been left out- e.g. R&B legends- Donny Hathaway and Phyllis Hyman. But, I still highly recommend this book! You will probably learn some interesting facts that you never knew!"
4,Good Customer Service at Agri-Fab,Thank God for good customer service at Agri-Fab because out of the box one of the bolts did not have thread. Agri-Fab customer service sent a new one next day (free of charge). During my second use the weld on one of the double spindles that hold the knives came loose but again customer service came through and sent a replacement (no questions asked). All in all things happen but good customer service goes a long way to keep a customer happy when stuff breaks.
3,Product Evaluation,"The product was shipped and delivered in a timely manner. A couple of small fasteners were missing from the package. However a call to the manufacturers customer service representative resulted in a quick shipment of the missing hardware. (Shortages of hardware shouldn't happen but if and when it does it sure is nice to have the supplier take care of it in a friendly and expeditious manner)Overall the product works as described. Raising and lowering the aerator from working position to towing position could be a little easier. Adding weight to allow deeper penetration of the ground takes more effort to raise and lower the machine.Making a change to ""fix"" the raising and lowering of the machine, could in this reviewers opinion make this possibly a 5 star rating.Regards.Dan"
4,Does a good job,"This product is a bit tedious to assemble and one has to be careful to exactly follow the instructions or you will be re-assembling but, once together, it is easy to use and does the intended job.I saw other products which look as though they sort of tear a piece out of the ground but this one very nicely removes plugs which should help aerate the ground."
4,"Gets the job done, at a price","Works well if you weigh it down, under the right conditions, but it is truth that it is HARD putting it together. They should/could have partially assembled some of it before sending. It took hours to get it all together, and there were tense moments when I thought it wouldn't fit together, but it did. Easy to jack knife it in reverse. But, gets the job done much cheaper over a few seasons than renting one. My advice, share the cost with neighbors, but more importantly, share the labor for assembly!"
4,agrifab 40 inch plug aerator,I agree with some of the previous reviews that there are alot of parts to put together. Fortunately I had my 2 and four year old to help. The instructions also appeared to be incorrect when in came to postioning the handle but this did not take long to figure out. It does take alot of weight to get the plugs to dig into the dirt but with presoaking the yard it went well. I was also afraid that the steal used would be a light grade but the unit was very solid. In all I am happy with the purchase.
3,lawn aerator,"This not for those who mind ""some assembly required""It has about 100 parts and takes about an afternoon to assemble"
4,Aerator,"Product as advertised, works great. Three small parts were lost out of the box during shipping but company replaced quickly. Will pay for itself in two applicatons compared to our lawn service charges."
5,Does the job well,"Its an aerator, what can I say about it?It plugs holes without problems and sets up easy.Sorry, just don't have much feelings about it, I just drag it around twice a year.Like I said, it works well."
2,Can't Get It Right,"He takes Norse sagas, which Scandinavians believe are stories of CREATION and calls them predictions (!!!); and includes prophecies from any and every body who every said something about the future, without respect to their track record or accuracy. Finally, the book is terribly hard to read, with glossy images overlying the multiple-typefaced text. It would make a nice coffeetable book -- but if you're looking for substantive, scholarly, significant predictions arranged in a comprehensible style, this just ain't it."
3,Eerily accurate!,"If you like this type of book, you'll also enjoy the puckish predictions in ""The Optimist's/Pessimist's Guide to the Millennium"" by Kipfer & Strnad. Have a happy 2000!"
3,Nice to see again...but not a great format.,"Honestly, it's great to see these episodes available again. But, I can't be very complimentary about this release.First, Unbox is not the way to re-release something. You can't watch it without your computer or portable device. You can't transcode it to DVD because the industry just LOVES their Digital Rights Managment (DRM) and simply cannot allow us to make the decision on how we view OUR materials that WE PAID FOR.Second, this release has numerous audio dropouts in each episode. They only last about a second, but they are still annoying. Amazon needs to ditch Unbox videos until they have better quality control methods, and until they find a way of letting us burn videos to DVD if we want to. There is nothing illegal about that...there just isn't."
3,Love the show but amazon needs to fix the sound quality,"PROS:- full episodes (unedited with original music)- instant play feature (convenient to watch anywhere; technology permitting)CONS:- sound (I'm not sure if they got this directly from VHS or perhaps it may be the recording quality, but there are too many instances where the sound disappears anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Makes it hard to enjoy some of the puns. I'm pretty sure it's not my computer either, because playback of other videos/shows/films worked fine for me.)- can't purchase on DVD (I wish they sold this on DVD for the same price as the instant play; all I've seen are VHS versions and expensive DVD ones.)"
2,Dissapointed,"Used a lot stupid and other insults. I had such fond memories of Charlie Brown, but found myself cringing when watching this with my two little boys. Would not recommend."
2,Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil,Good tasting popcorn but it could shave a few years from your life. It's loaded down with Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil and then sprayed with Artificial Flavor.Too bad it's not natural.
4,Where is it?,Where is this popcorn????? I love it and cannot find it anywhere. Please bring it back.Thanks
1,NOT VERY TASTY!!,I purchased this product in bulk due to the many high reviews but was very dissapointed in the taste. Just like eating cardboard!! Yuck! I cannot recommend this prodcut at all. My dog will not even eat it! Save your money and but something else.
3,4 films on 1 disc,"Just to give you some content details. I thought this was a documentary on Barbara Stanwyck but it's actually four films, only the first of which features Stanwyck: Lady of Burlesque, which has multiple versions available on single DVDs anyway. The other films are Of Human Bondage (with Bette Davis) which again is widely availble, The Southerner (starring Zachary Scott) and Behind Office Doors (starring Mary Astor). Cover picture features Stanwyck and Davis."
3,A Drawn Out Story of Chinese Culture,"I thought this book was okay but I didn't really enjoy it as much as other novels I have read. I thought that it was nice to learn about the Chinese culture and how Chinese Americans lived around the time of World War II. At the same time, I disliked it because it just sort of dragged on and it seemed to me that there wasn't a main point in the story. I would recommend this book to people who really like to learn about other cultures. I wouldn't recommend it for any body who likes more drama and more of a story line."
3,Fifth Chinese Daughter Book Review,"The book Fifth Chinese Daughter by Jade Snow Wong shows very well the Chinese culture in the 1900's in San Franciso's Chinatown. I thought it was neat learning about the Chinese culture because I like learning about cultures, but I thought it was kind of boring. The book repeatingly talked about education and cooking and working, and her life was not too exciting or had many adventures. Also, I would have liked it better if it had been a boy. It is different than other books I have read because it's about the Chinese culture. I also don't read too many books that are non-fiction and maybe that makes it less exciting. The novel was okay. I wish it had more action to it. I would recommend it to people who are very interested in the Chinese culture or in other cultures."
2,"Not the Greatest, but Somewhat Enjoyable","This novel was overall ok but it didn't really do it for me. In the beginning it was somewhat interesting and kind of fun to learn how a Chinese family lives in America, but as the book progressed, it got less and less interesting. I did like it when she was growing up but once it got to college, it just kept getting more and more boring to me. I did not like how the book didn't really have anything very exciting happening that made me want to read more. I have read many novels and this is definitely not one of my favorites. If you are the kind of person who likes simple novels then you might like this one. If you like novels with action and excitement, you will definitely want to sit this one out."
5,Worth the money,I had to buy this book for a world literature class and after reading it would have bought it even if I had not had the class. The book lead our class to learn more about Chinese culture in the United States and started interesting discussions. The book is hard to put down and I found myself reading ahead often.
4,Fifth Chinese Daughter,"Jade Snow Wong grew up in San Francisco in a China town with her traditional Chinese family. While she lived with her family, she had been taught rules with a hurtful punishment, attended two different schools at the same time (a public school, which she skips grades, and a Chinese school), and while she was not at school, she was helping to cook a meal or, doing house hold chores. Throughout Jade Snow's life she wanted freedom from everyone, so she went to collage. There she experienced change, humor, excitement, and happiness.This delighting novel is very educational and fun to read. (That is why I liked it.) This book should be spread around the country or even world, because it is so interesting and you learn a lot from it."
5,"Impeccable, documented, ground breaking scholarship","Written by Peter Corning (Director of the Institute for the Study of Complex Systems in Palo Alto, California), Nature's Magic: Synergy In Evolution And The Fate Of Humankind presents a ""Synergism Hypothesis"" that combines economic theory with the complexity of biology and life science. Applying theory to the evolution of humanity from the level of apes, to the acquisition of language, science, and projections of the future, Nature's Magic is a quite profound and widely encompassing amalgamation of inductive reasoning and broad repeating patterns directly affecting society itself. A work of impeccable, documented, ground breaking scholarship, Nature's Magic is so well written as to be complete accessible to academic and non-specialist general readers alike."
3,Good product,"I purchased these for my 9-year-old daughter, who is starting to get a bosom but certainly does not need a bra. She likes wearing them and does so without complaint. They are very simple - there is no shelf bra sewn into them, which I would have liked. For the price, they're fine."
1,Too confusing a style for me,"Sorry, the very things that made the other reviewers call this book ""hypnotic"" and ""dreamy"" just left me in a total fog. Characters without names, unidentified times and places. Instead of making me ""peel back layers,"" it left me saying...""wait, who are we talking about here?"" And while aspects of the mother-daughter obsession were compelling, most of it made me want to tell them both to ""snap out of it!"" Guess you really have to embrace this style of writing to appreciate the book."
1,A weirdo,"I would've given this 0 stars if I could. Nikki the idiot Webster is just such a wannabe. She has air in her head. She smiles like she thinks she is so pretty and I have to say what a face. She is too ugly to live. And now she is mimicking hippys well poor them if she mimicked me I would knock her head off. About 70% of people hate her and most of the review complain so why don't they just kick her out so we can have some peace?????Point: She is a little weirdo who acts like a 2 year old (correct, a 2 year old has more brains then her) and if you want to believe it go to [...]au to see her trash."
5,Winning 7-Card Stud,"This is an excellent book for the beginner and for players that need to get back to the basics. Ashley just ""tells it like it is"".Must reading.Ken"
4,"Great condition for the ""price""","The product came in a timely manner but the soft envelope did not protect the mail service from bending the corner noticeably on every page. Also, it would have been nice to know when the book was coming..."
5,Broken Sword 2 Smoking Mirror,"Broken sword 2: The Smoking Mirror is a creative and unique experience, from start to finish. Everything from the gripping storyline, and cartoonish style of graphics, makes this one a delight!I would personally reccomned the entire series, for gamers looking for something fresh and new to experience."
3,Bernie R. Hadn't Jelled Yet,"This was Lawrence Block's first Bernie Rhodenbarr mystery. Originally published in 1977 it features Block's humor, but it's missing his nifty plotting and three-dimensional women characters. It features yet another example of Block's obsession with lesbians (someone could write a dissertation thesis on this), but this time it seems gratuitious and exploitive. Read this one for background, but there are much better books in the series."
5,Mr. Block does it again!,"This is the third Lawrence Block book I have read. He hasn't disappointed me yet. This is a nice page turner. Block's dialog is second to none. His character's are always intriguing, and his plots fascinating. Lawrence Block is a rare breed. I found this book a great introduction to the lead character ""Bernie Rhodenbarr"". If you are looking for a good mystery, this a a great choice. Happy reading!"
3,3.5 stars - Good+,"As long as one doesn't have a problem with the protagonist being a burglar, this is a cleaver, light series with a real sense of New York City, fully developed characters, and crisp dialogue. I would recommend reading the series in order. If you're looking for a quick, light read, these fill the bill."
1,Wrong one for 2600; No response from seller,"This is useless for NOKIA 2600 as they advertise. I complained to the seller. NO RESPONSE. BUY IT AT YOUR RISK.My money is gone forever, it seems !!"
2,Not very clear compared to high end digital cordless phones.,"You get some decent features for the money, but the clarity of phone calls is really terrible when compared to the best digital cordless phones. My cordless Panasonic from the early 90's sounded better than this."
3,Be Aware,"I have a sashiko machine by Babylock and I was looking for guidance on the many different stitches and interesting ways to use them. This is an older book which does not address that. What I did not know is that this book was written by Bernina for use with a standard Bernina sewing machine. About half of the book is useless to me as it focuses on information I don't need with the machine I have. There are some interesting designs to make but that is where the utility, for me, ends. If you are into making clothing, it has a sectioin on how to use sashiko there as well. This book is strictly for those who want to use their standeard sewing machine to create sashiko works and who might be doing construction sewing. If you have a sashiko machine this is not for you."
2,"Predictable plot, annoying characters","I was excited to get this book because I'm a single woman in my mid-twenties living in LA. However, the author writes like a teenage girl who is fantasizing about what adult life is like. The characters say annoying things like, ""Byee"" and ""We're drinks!"" The writer doesn't seem to have a particular writing style; she's all over the place. There also seems to be this need to squeeze in the name of as many ""cool, trendy"" LA bars as possible, which is pointless and adds nothing to the story. It's readable, but not well-written. I would NEVER compare this book to Bridget Jones' Diary."
2,Ugh.,"This is the second worst RDI book (after Strapless- double ugh). The fact that the whole homely to sex goddess story has been done a million times isn't what makes it bad, it's that it wasn't even done in a fresh way. The whole book was one huge cliche. Angels by Marian Keyes is a similar story, but written MUCH better. The characters in LA Woman are SO annoying and stereotypical, and I wanted to slap Sarah. Very one-dimensional. Ugh."
3,Kritters Ramblings,"With a little hesitation, I pick up chick lit because I have to be in the mood for light and fluffy. Although this quintessential chick lit, it had heart and soul that made it more than just a girlie read. A story centered around a girl who makes the decision to ""follow"" or rather move to a new city - L.A., where her long-term fiance is said to follow. Will he ever move and will they ever get married? The ultimate questions.As a girl who has decided to move with a boy, it takes some courage, guts and many conversations to confirm that this is the best decision both for yourself and the both of you as a couple. Not recommended for everyone, but if done right, it can build a solid foundation. Off the soap box - I loved this book, even if I had to read it in mass market form!"
3,The Best of Bunch,"This is by far the best of the Red Dress Ink books that have beenpublished. Sophisticated and mature, LA Woman is what I expected the Red Dress Ink books to be. After the first books that were incredibly juvenile, I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, and I was pleasantly surprised.I totally identified with Sarah and her struggle to find her way in a new city, with no friends, and a boyfriend who is a jerk. Martika was by far the most interesting character that I have read, and LA Woman is definitely the most realistic novel about twentysomethings living in LA and not dealing with reality. The only thing that marred the book were a few misspellings that should have been taken care of by the author, for example Kim Basinger's name has only one S. This is easily checked and shouldn't be left for the copy editor. I'm interested now in reading Cathy Yardley's other books. If Red Dress Ink continues to publish authors and stories that have this quality, I will buy them."
4,A Fun Read!,"I literally cheered for Sarah when she finally tells Benjamin off! Loved her new buddy in town, Taylor - an absolutely sweet and hilarious guy. Sarah's new roomie Martika is great. Totally the opposite of Sarah, of course. But so lively & fun - although the gal does live on the wild side. I flew through this book & found it entertaining and witty.This book was 5 stars all the way through until the very end of the book where I felt it ended a little too fast. Without given the story away, I also felt like, by then, Sarah knew better than to have ""chosen"" that last big problem. But otherwise, the characters were great, the story was great & I really enjoyed this book."
4,Fast and fun,"I liked the pace of this book. The Los Angeles setting, the characters, the descriptions of LA club life, and the transformation of ""Eleanor"" are all entertaining and make for a perfect beach read.However, the whole ""Odd Couple"" scenario has been done and re-done. I really had hoped this novel would avoid this. Still, L.A. Woman is fun and a nice addition to the Red Dress Ink series. If you're a fan of the series, you'll find that this book will not disappoint."
3,Not what I thought it would be,While the story was captivating to a point. I guess It was just not enough to keep me interested.
4,"""L.A. Woman"" is a fun and exciting story","Sarah from ""L.A. Woman"" is a woman that many other young women can relate to. She is a confused twenty-five year old woman looking for her destiny. I often found myself relating to her throughout the book; from the make-up lines to the thoughts and feelings! Cathy Yardley does a great job detailing the main character, Sarah, and creates a normal woman walking down the streets of a city. I found this to be a very entertaining novel and believe that it may have even influenced my life.Yardley has a very clean, simple understood style. She keeps the plot exciting and the reader guessing. She uses an incredible set of characters and represents young people today accurately. My favorite thing about the book would be the way Yardley keeps the story modern and new- age. It is a great story with a magazine article tempo."
3,I've Read Better,"This book is easy to read, but a lil dull. I recommend Confessions of an Ex-Girlfriend..much more interesting to read and much funnier."
2,Huh?,"I was suprised this book was published. It's pretty poorly written and the story is trite. I finished it just to see if it would get any worse, and it didn't disappoint, the ending was... huh? I've lived in both LA and San Francisco, and I've rarely met women as shallow and one-dimensional as the protagonist. The only redeeming character is the ...friend."
3,Not quite the old Arcade Game,"This game lacks some of the advantages that it had in the arcade, namely the track ball. using the Gameboy directional pad is difficult to get used to and control. It is possible that if I played it enough, I would probably find it less challenging, tho. It has some nice graphics and the rumble feature is pretty cool. I think if you REALLY liked the arcade game you will like it if you are willing to take the time to get used to the controls."
1,Please Don't buy,"Don't buy this game! It has the worst graphics you have ever seen! You shoot a line at another line, and that is the object of the game. I thought the rumble feature was alright, but it was usually just a buzz, and it takes a battery."
3,"Great ideas, older children, requires well set up work space!","As I said many very good ideas, but limited useability for young children. Melting crayon or wax is dangerous so so this book is for older primary school age children and supervision is important as well as a set up work area. Safety first, but otherwise good art exploratory ideas. Thank you."
1,Not Good as it looks.,I spent almost $500 on this product and I was very dis-opointedat the quality even it suppose to be good brand .The top drawer doesn't lock and you have to push hard tokeep it close to the close position.I honestly dont advisebuying this product its not good as it looks.
2,"It's okay. Just ""okay.""","It's good for what we needed in our office, however, there are 2 draws that don't fit properly and tilt downward, making it difficult to hold the draws open while also filing papers into them. It does have a lot of room though. We did not contact HON or Amazon about the tilting drawers, too much hassle to do so. I've purchased many things from Amazon.com and personally, I think they are getting somewhat sloppy on their vendor quality requirements. This is the 3rd item we bought this year that has not been correct. Prior to this year, we NEVER had a problem with anything we bought at Amazon."
1,This seller and product was a joke as it CAME FROM THE SELLER DAMAGED!,Length:: 0:41 MinsHere is a damaged file cabinet that looks like someone ran into it with a fork lift and it was shipped to me to deal with. Now I have to go through all the hassle of return and getting another one.
4,A companion to books on spirituality,"I happened upon this book quite by accident.... At the time, I was reading Jordan Aumann's book, ""Spiritual Theology"" --a definitive book on Spirituality in the Dominican/Thomistic Tradition.... I began reading ""The Mystical Mind"" along with Fr. Aumann's book and discovered they could actually be read as ""companion"" books in that ""The Mystical Mind"" quite often offered insight into the brain's activity during peak spiritual experiences. I teach college-level psychology courses...many of the insights offered by ""The Mystical Mind"" have found their way into my lectures on neuropsychology. For the lay person without a psychological background, however, I would recommend an alternate book by one of the authors: ""Why God Won't Go Away."""
5,Wonderful collection of Americana from America's Baritone,"The Nelson Eddy Sings the Stephen Foster Songbook is a wonderful collection of old Americana songs performed to perfection by America's Baritone, Nelson Eddy."
1,what? no song list,"Much as I like Nelson Eddy, without the label doing us the courtesy of listing the songs, I can't spend my hard-earned loot on the CD. I've heard a few of the songs he did with a Southern drawl, and they were jarring, to say the least, to hear that great voice used in that manner. i have to guess this CD is more of the same."
1,Big Chance To Waste Your Money!,"Like the CD ""Claustrophobia"", this is another attempt to cash in on the early Australian years of the Bee Gees. Don't Bother. The fantastic collection ""Birth Of Brilliance-1963-1966"" contains 32 tracks and is a collectors item. Once you have this, you can ignore all these 'copy-cat' recordings. Besides, the cover is false. Band members Vince Melouney and Colin Petersen were never in the Bee Gees until 1967. Nice cover though."
5,Rare Gem!,"I heard one of the songs on a trip to Central America. Even though I am not very knowledgeable about this type of Music, everyone who listens to the songs absolutely loves the tunes. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves spanish music."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"The seller (Interstate Batteries) sent me a Battery instead of a phone. Even if you need the battery, you can find it way cheaper at ebay."
1,Not worth the money,"I was hoping this was EZ but it turned out to be impossible. I am our companies computer systems manager and I've loaded hundreds of software/hardware packages. I cannot get the terminal to respond to the software and I've tried all the faq's from the companies website on two different computer. I tried to register online, and that faulted out, and forced me into a snail mail registation. You have to download the help files (they are not on the CD) and they failed to load when I search a topic. Based on some of the software out there, I'd rate this one as low as it gets. Even if it ever does work, I wouldn't pay more the $250 for a credit card swipper and $20 software package"
2,Overrated and overwritten,"The plot is threadbare, the characters are two-dimensional, and the prose is so overwritten that it eclipses the book's tenuous literary merits."
3,SWimming Pool Library,"I'm of two minds about this book. It is unbelievably torrid. However, the plot is transparent,and the characters totally cardboard.It is a very quick and juicy read, but don't look for much more."
3,Characters unsympathetic,"Good enough, well written, but I preferred his latest. The characters in this one are unsympathetic. And it ends abruptly. Evokes a time and place, though."
3,the swimming pool library,"An enchanting story of homosexuality, but written in a style not east-to-read. Sometimes it gets boring, sometimes it takes your breath. It explores in detail modern homosexual life and it provides a very challenging topic for further researches."
3,Kindle owners beware!,"The Kindle version of this novel is obviously an OCR copy of the original. No attempt has apparently been made to correct the common OCR mistakes in spelling and punctuation interpretation. It's as though whoever created this Kindle content simply ran the novel through an OCR program and published it, without bothering to check the accuracy. I like the book itself, I like the Kindle, but this offering is definitely sub-par."
5,Homosexuality for all sexual preferences:,"Women! Want to get those juices of desire flowing whiledipping into literature more inspiring than romance novels? Try thistitillating book for all sexual preferences! I speak for women who have read this wonderfully sensual book about homosexuality in early nineteenth and also more recent England, with a little African history thrown in: a book about a man writing a biography of a mysterious older man he meets in the London public baths. On a par in literary quality with A.S. Byatt's ""Possession,"" and in some ways more perfectly constructed."
1,sorry....,"While ones look for fresh creativity across different musical genres, reggae music is often overlooked or is expected to be the same old thing;nothing really new or spectacular. Unfortunately, this is the same feeling I walk away with after hearing this album. The keen listener will norice from the start that the lyrical content contains alot of ""reggae keywords"" but not much substance. His voice too, I must say, becomes downright aggravating after a short while.Certainly, when placed next to the masters of the genre, Johnny Dread's impact becomes little next of nothing. A serious fan of roots reggae might as well stick to real roots from Jamaica instead of re-hashed made in the USA wannabe stuff like this"
2,Disappointed,I bought this because I thought it was a version of Lilac Time. It is not. It is an unconvincing story with very little to commend it musically.
2,Poorly engineered,I have a number of Rachel Ray stuff but the last two purchases were disappointing. The handle on this skillet is long and heavy making it tip over unless there is something in the skillet. I finally slid the orange cover off and used a hack saw to remove an inch or two from the handle. Not a great solution but at least it will sit flat now.
2,Disappointing,"Far from being the promised ""pee your pants laugh fest"", Teen Angst is an utterly generic - and bland - collection. Although one of two of the poems evoked a grin, for the most part, these are thoroughly unremarkable, and a far cry from being ""so bad they're good"". I found the blurbs leading into each of the entries much more interesting than the actual poems, establishing the context in which each was written, but still felt as though something was missing. Great idea, but strangely unfunny."
2,A Not-So-Funny Attempt,"I was actually looking forward to getting Teen Angst in the mail, but after reading through it, I was disappointed. I found only a few poems to be even remotely funny: 4 exactly. The rest were just really bad poems. The introductions to the poems were often humorous, but the individual poems consist of hardly any humor. I felt as though I was grading an 8th grade English class' poetry assignments. Of course, that's what some of these poems are...Certainly NOT the pee-in-your-pants laughing I was promised."
1,This is the worst cd rom I have ever purchesed,"First off this CD Rom should accompany the book, but it only covers select pages. It is virtualy impossible to navigate the CD and the choices are so few it is of little use. I expected something that would be easy to follow either on the CD itself or on the instructions on how to run the CD, both were of no help in fact the instructions consisted of 4 peices of paper that basicly covers how to install the Disc itself. This to me was a waste of fifty bucks! I recomend that if you are intrested in purchesing this CD-Rom you should think twice."
2,Strange organization,"I am currently using this text in a Spanish class. I find this book's organization to be nonintuitive. For example, the vocabulary and grammar for a given chapter is presented at the end of the chapter...except when it is scattered throughout the main text as well. I have trouble finding information that I *know* is in the text someplace because of strange things like this..."
1,Spanish Professors: Don't Use this Book!,This book is horribly organized; the text presents a labryinth of information in an format that is likely to instigate errors and common mistakes in Spanish. The publishers out to recall this book immediately.
4,A lucid presentation,"This is undoubtedly one of the most lucid books ever written in the theory of plasticity. At a time when there were so few books available on the subject, this book was the gateway to plasticity for many. Even though over 20 years have passed since its first publication, much of the material remains relevant today. I wish the author would publish a second edition."
4,Plasticity : Theory and Applications,I am a proffesor in the university and this book is my textbook.
5,Creator of it all CD,"Excellent album. If you are looking for geniune Christian praise music, not the worldy stuff most people think of today, this is a must have. Soothing and uplifting songs."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. I knew it was out of print and the one I was ordering was used, but by the description I certainly could not tell that the book was written in....big blue inscription to someone's dad inside the front cover. I ordered this as a gift for someone who had seen a copy in a cabin and loved it. Buyer beware. To me, sellers should note a book in written. A little shelf wear is to be expected but very good condition or the like shouldn't be written in in bold blue pen in my opinion. Guess I should have asked. The book itself is a delight."
5,As good as the coffee shop offers!,"The Big Train brand of iced coffee drinks is really good. I've seen the brand in a couple of local coffee shops and after trying the iced coffees there, I looked for this brand online. It's great and I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,can't believe they sold it,"I went over to CD warehouse after class to check out what they had availiable. After I browsed through the selection, I spotted the CD. I asked the clerk to get the CD so I could listen to it. I listened to it for a while, and found that nearly all the songs on it were pretty tight. I decided to get the CD, since it was only for 8 dollars. When I put the CD in my car, to listen it again. The CD really bumped, this CD is tight, and I can't believe the original owner sold it. I am looking forward to volume 2. Because there is a whole slew of ""unknowns"" out there waiting to be discovered."
3,What happened to these artists?,"Ok this is a CD that was a great idea, that well...flopped.where are the artists from UNKNOWNWERKS now?uhmmm...i wish that Astralwerks Records would have tried to see whatsome of these artists could do.i mean they were good enough to put on this cd right.so why not more.So, the best song on here is Central's ""Hard Hit"", (sort of a60's spy theme meets bigbeat...i love it) it actually remindsme of the Propellerheads album ""DecksDrumsAndRockandRoll"".but where is Central now?Also Le Pimp ""King of the Bad Groove"", this is a great songi have also downloaded another song by this guy called ""le RockNon Stop"" which is simple but excellent.But where is Le Pimp now?Why did the label give up on these potentially bright new artists?it is just disappointing that's all."
3,backscratch review,"pretty good back scratcher. almost as good as fingernails. it is a little narrow, but works okay"
1,Very unhappy with the product and the customer service,"My son ordered this Back Scratcher with few other EarthTherapeutics items via Amazon as my Christmas gift. The scratcher is supposed to have five distinctive fingers to scratch. Unfortunately, three of them were sticking together. I called the customer service number and left message twice to see what I should do with it. Unfortunately, they never returned my call. Now, I stucked with the product without knowing what to do."
5,:D,"You should have seen the look on my dad's face!He was so happy.He loves getting his back scratched and when we weren't not around,he had been using the furniture to get those hard to reach spots! hahaThe stem of the scratcher is slighlty curvedand the grip is great for stability.It is also slightly longer and sturdier than those scratchersyou can buy at the Asian markets.Shipping was prompt and found some great complimentary gifts fromEarth Therapeutics. Thanks! Great merchant.(Free shipping for orders over $20)"
4,Deluxe back scratch,"This back scratcher works great. It has no problem reaching all areas and the rubber grip is very comfortable. I bought a few of them and the only problem on one is that the end-cap with the rope came off. It looks like it wasn't glued on very good. I always have mine when I'm watching TV and I've discovered that they are very sturdy. Whenever one of my teenagers messes with me when I'm watching I use it to beat them, too. Very effective!"
4,You scratch my back and ...........,"What can I say. It is a back scratcher. It it well made, the right length, and will probably last forever! The provider was prompt, and even included a little gift with the order."
5,I loved it,I ordered this product because I have frozen shoulder and it was great till my puppy ate the scratching part was going to order another but it is unaviable still if they get more stock I will order at least 3 more just in case of puppy damage
3,Not sharp enough for my hubby,Gave as a gift to my husband. He loves his back scratched. He said it reached great but wanted it a little sharper.
4,Helpful for each nationality,I am a ESL teacher and tutor 5 Vietnamese students. Four out of 5 ordered this dictionary for themselves. The reason I did not rate this with 5 stars is that some useful words were not found in this dictionary. When I visited Vietnam next year I am considering taking some along to share with my host families.Enjoy
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a short, silly movie. The reason for having this tape is the singing of Richard Tauber, not quite at his best performing in English, but, nevertheless, one of the greatest tenors of the century. His screen character is given an Italian name -- not credible for a moment because his voice and accent are obviously Germanic. But I don't care about that; I just want to see and hear him. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of this cassette chose to issue it in extended play format, at great cost to picture quality (reduced tape longevity can also be expected at this playback speed). It's difficult to understand why anyone would be so cheap. If they needed to save on tape, they should have excerpted the musical selections and cut out the rest of the movie, since Tauber's singing is the only worthwhile thing in it anyway. This cassette is worth just about what it costs -- under $5. (This review applies to the Madacy issue. I have not seen the Bel Canto Society tape.)"
2,really could not get into it,unfortunately I tried to get into this book and I really couldnt. Did not have that factor that keeps me going.
5,Awesome book,"I completely recommend this book if you are new to gardening and don't have a lot of space to build a garden. There is great information in this book on techniques to save space, fertilize, and picking the right kinds of plants for your garden. I using the square foot gardening technique in my raised garden this year."
4,Great for inexperienced gardeners,"Last year was the first time I had a garden and I had no idea what I was doing. Over the winter a friend recommended this book and I absolutely loved it. It's logical, helpful and easily understood. I didn't do every single thing he recommended, but it really helped me set up a good small garden this year. The only reason I took away one star was that while the plant-by-plant guide at the end is helpful, it doesn't cover even all the plants he recommends."
4,The Easy Way to Garden,"Mel Bartholomew's Square Foot Gardening is one of the best gardening books on the market. It shows you how to maximum your gardening effeciency by growing the plants in a wide bed instead of the more traditional narrow row method developed for tractors. By reducing the rows and maximizing the area of planting, you reduce the amount of wasted water and compose. You get more out of this important resources and your gardening efforts. The book is 20 years old and a little dated, but still worth the purchase for the beginning gardener."
5,"Among the best organic system books anywhere, anytime","This is a classic. If you're a novice gardener, it will be your bible. If you're experienced, it will give you great ideas. I've actually bought this book twice over my gardening career. First I was a novice gardener working the back 40 square feet in an urban garden. It became the talk of the neighborhood. Over the years, I let someone borrow it, and lost track of it. So now, 20 years into gardening, I needed a little boost of enthusiasm after having a couple of bad years. I now garden about 1/4 acre, and used this book this year to manage my vegetable crop. I've got my green thumb back."
4,Great Gardening Ideas,"I liked the idea of a well-planned garden and this book had it all. I set my 10X15 foot garden up according to the illustrations and made tomato trellises using metal posts and wire. I have to say that by the end of the season there was a lot of die-off from fungus. Frankly, 1 foot square is not enough room for the average tomato plant, even on its nifty trellis. My melons and zucchini caught the fungus, too. I'd recommend using this book as a guide and spacing the plants further apart. It did keep everything neat and easier to weed. Overall good system."
1,"If you CARE about gardening, this book is a waste","The latest version of this book is the worst. It's almost an insult to anyone with a little gardening experience and the ability to think for themselves. I particularly dislike his overbearing, ""cutesy"" attitude. All the relevant information could have been put into 25 pages - and found in almost any other gardening book. This was perhaps the least useful of my 50+ gardening books until I recently put it on the ""free"" pile at our local gardening seminar."
2,BEST MOVE YET,I have gardened my whole life beginning as a child. When I decided to introduce my grand children to gardening I purchased this book. I am astounded at what I have learned and am learning. It is an invaluable resource book usefull to beginners as well as oldtimers. I wish I had purchased it many years ago instead of last month.
2,Too many options,"I guess I was looking for the quick answer version. Here's your square, now plant this....Not a book for the average gardener. Unless, of course, you are a botonist."
4,Good book,I am new to gardening world. Just like the author I am also an engineer. May be that's why I like his approach. It provides for a really flexible methodology that anybody can follow.
2,Wasted a lot of money on square-foot gardening,"It cost me about $200 to fill my raised bed with the planting mix recommended. It was a complete waste of money, as the water runs right out of the mix. It is far too light. He's right, you cannot overwater, but it also does not hold the water. In areas where water costs money or is scarce, this soil mix is a very bad idea."
4,Informative and Innovative,"Very helpful charts of when to plant and harvest related to frost date.Gives innovative, simple ideas on how to plant for max productivity.Great for Beginners, and really good for advanced gardeners too to get a different perspective of their garden.Author is a little condescending...Overall very good gardening book!Excellent for the aspiring self-sufficient gardener!"
4,Sq Foot Gardening,I had seen the book before and thought it is a good reference to keep and use. The book is an excellent source for small crop gardening.
5,Simple for the most unknowledgeable beginner,"We have a 6 year old who has been fascinated with gardens. While my husband's mom had a small backyard vegetable garden a few years growing up, we have no experience gardening, and really do not delight in basic ""yardwork"". We decided to pursue growing a garden as a family project to learn together and develop her enjoyment of the idea of a garden. Although the initial stages do involve good planning and the preparation of the soil is important, the results have been overwhelming. Two months into it we have had numerous salads, veggies and are awaiting homegrown tomatoes, and cataloupe. We have found it to be so easy and it requires little time every day, and only takes up minimum space. GIVE IT A TRY!!"
5,The best vegetable gardening book to start with,"This book transformed me into a gardener, from a former self who would buy a few tomato plants or pepper seeds and watch nothing much happen. We've all read generic gardening books with nice photos and a long recitation of suggested, common methods for doing what needs to be done. One of the reasons that Square Foot Gardening is different is that the author has strong preferences. Start seeds in vermiculite! Plant oak leaf lettuce! Read the seed catalogs in december! --Because of Bartholomew's enthusiasm, these specific things are fun to start with, and because his method works so well, you wind up happy and with lots of vegetables. One warning though, I tried to build a Bartholomew style trellis from copper plumbing and string, a bit too close to a neighbor's property line. ""I'm sorry, but this looks like a soccer net."" I tore it down and worked considerably harder on something nicer. (But yes, do build the trellis, it's worth it.)"
5,Most Excellent!,"I have done square foot gardening for 15 years based on his book. It is excellent. I have one in my cement patio in the back leading to my garage. It truly takes very little time and produces lots of vegetables and looks very decorative too. It gives me a calming effect when I cook and look out my kitchen window. When you buy his book, you will not be disappointed. Also, it produces a lot of lettuce which you can pick fresh each day."
3,If I only I had known,"There is a lot of great information in this book. I wish that I had purchased the ""New Square Foot Garden"" book by the same author. It is a simpler form of the book with more diagrams."
5,Perfect for beginners and veteran gardeners alike!,"This ""gardening instruction manual"" is a perfect fit for our 90's lifestyle - not enough time, and small yards instead of acreage. Good organic info (fertilizer, compost, etc)too. I first purchased this book in the early 80's as a newly-wed with the idea that I might like to try a small garden. The square foot garden concept is so simple, and the garden is so easy to maintain that I have used it since then."
3,Good book,This is a good book if you have the patience for it. I think I'm just way to adhd to concentrate for that long.
4,Enjoyable series,"I have read two books in this series and truly enjoyed both of them, my only problem is that the third book in the series has not been added for kindle purchase:("
4,Good torchiere,"This unit has an attractive chrome finish. All the light from the 4, 26 watt GU24 CFL bulbs is directed upward so there is no distracting glare as is frequently the case in torchieres with glass shades. Of course, you better have a white ceiling. The interior of the bowl is painted white and probably has considerable light loss due to close quarters and multiple reflections for the light to escape. Will fall over if tilted more than about 18 degrees. The switch has 4 postions: off, 1 bulb, 2 bulbs, 4 bulbs illuminated. You can't get too far away from the unit and still have good light for reading - about 3 feet."
1,No Replacement Bulbs,"Light Blaster(tm) Ultra Spectrum Torchiere Floor Lamp is a good lamp, solidly made, but there is a problem with the bulbs. The lamp came with the VIVA PBCFS2670120v 26W which I cannot find after hours of searching. LampsPlus sells the lamp but doesn't sell the bulb. The bulb which they are now shipping with the lamp, the MaxLite GU24, doesn't fit 2 of the 4 sockets. It is just a little too wide. We broke a bulb when the lamp arrived and immediately tried to replace it but we could not. So don't buy the lamp unless you can find replacement bulbs which we could not find and which LampsPlus.com will not find for you."
1,Defective product. $50 restocking fee!!!!!,Lamp Plus sold me a defective lamp. When trying to contact them they did not reply to my concerns. I tried emailing them many times but still no adequate reply. I did however much to my shock is that they charge a $50 restocking fee eventhough they sold me a lamp that did not work. Why should I pay $50 restocking fee for something that Lamp Sold sold to me that was defective!!!! I tried calling them. I did get a representative but he was rude and mean and refused to answer my concerns. Overall a horrific experience. I'm out $175 and stuck with a lamp that does not work. Beware you may get ripped off by LAMP PLUS. Their customer service stinks and their products stinks.
2,"Interesting, but not a travelogue","I was expecting a travelogue that would help me remember the wonderful scenery I saw when I drove around the Great Lakes. There was some scenery in this 55-minute video, but mostly the video centered on the lives of a fisherman, a tugboat pilot, a Grand Traverse Bay grape grower, and a sailboat operator. The stories were interesting enough, but not really worth the $20 I paid for this video. I can't imagine I'll watch the video more than once."
4,"Very good, if violent, film about social displacement","A moving, well shot, well acted portrait of the desperation of being a Kurd trying toearn a living in Germany.Almost crossed over the line to 5 stars, but the villains were a bit too easy and onenote, and coincidence a bit too key to the story-telling.A shy, inward young man travels west to meet his brother, and try to send moneyhome to his family, only to find his brother is now a pimp, and they are both caughtup in a blood feud with local Turk immigrants. At the same time, our main charactertries to shelter and take care of a young Kurdish boy who has lost his parents, and traveledto Germany as an orphan.Some of the violence is a little over-the-top, and you can feel your buttons beingpushed now and then, but it's always absorbing and involving."
3,Warning: Can't Be Used With Many Outdoor Timers,"I got this to use for my outdoor holiday light display. The male end of the plug (the end that connects to the wall outlet) has an oversized casing that prevents it from being plugged into many outdoor timers. (A protrusion on the timers blocks the oversized casing on the plug). Although I'm sure the cord works fine if plugged directly into an outlet, be warned, this brand won't work with many outdoor timers typically used for holiday light displays. I ended up returning this and getting a different brand with the same specs/features from the home improvement store. The other brand has a normal sized male plug which works with the timers."
3,Essential contradiction,"Do not be put off by my mediocre rating or fellow reviewers intent on highlighting the horrors of war. This is a serious peace of work which deserves to grace anyone's collection. Quite simply such eloquence from such a master tactician is extremely rare and the author's prussian arrogance is more an institutionalised devotion to his men and his duty than todays understanding of humanity.The book mirrors the advances of the German army with valuable insights into lightning advances through France and Barbarossa. Inevitably it becomes bogged down around Stalingrad but for me the key revelations centre around ""what now after France?"" with Von Mansteins scathing criticism of the BEF escape at Dunkirk and the lapdog role that OKH was reduced to. It certainly evaporated my generations view of the superhuman german machine in terms of planning, organisation and military structure.This is a book which I know I will return to time and again."
3,A Prussian remembers WWII,"This book is a little dull for the casual historian, but just the right stuff for those armchair generals and wannebe field marshals. I recommend this book with reservations - do not read his book cover-to-cover, but rather skip around and hit the best parts - there are 3 outstanding sections 1) without a doubt the Sevastopol Crimean campaign was his military masterpiece. This chapter (# 9) reads well and is very interesting. 2) Then touch on the Stalingrad chapter to understand why the German Sixth did not, or could not, break out - some surprising facts are divulged and it is a little deeper and more thoughtful than just blaming it all on Hitler. 3) Then read about his last meeting with Adolf - when he got canned. V. Manstien does not concede it, but that was the luckiest day of his goosestepping life."
2,A brilliant Field Marshall offers his opinions.,"One of the best military books I have read. Written by one of the Third Reich's most brilliant military strategists. The book is not an apologia for Nazi Germany but a hard look into reasons why and how Germany lost the war in spite of winning so many early battles. Manstein relates conversations with Hitler who he maintains, he and most of Germany's generals, disagreed with and even, at times, considered replacing. I also liked that it was not laden with minute descriptions of battles and troop movements. There is some of that but only when it is useful in explaining larger tactical and strategic considerations. It also provides insights into mistakes made by Polish and French military planners. Basically, they made military plans based on the assumption that European assurances would be honored. He states Hitler's strength was his conviction that Europe was unwilling to fight another war and would make excuses to not come to the aid of its allies."
1,Infalible technique - disgraceful hypocrisy...,"This book by Manstein is horrible. How can someone say it is good? That he was a master general ? THis book is another one of those books written by German generals and field marshalls that, since Hitler was dead, took full advantage of the fact to place the blame of all bloody bath caused by the German armed forces (and their posterior defeat) into Hitler's shoulder, why everything good (victories, etc) was their responsibility. In reading this book, it becomes clear how German generals succumbed to Hitler and did and they could to give victory to the mad man, and after the war they said that they could not have anything different, that their ""oath'"" prevented them to get Hitler ouf of power. Come on!!! Do you think we are so naive?!!!! The general received bribbery all the war long, it is a proved fact. THey were aristocratic people who didn't give a damn to their soldiers, as long as the Fueherer kept them well fed.."
5,Rifts Book Is Ok[Not Just Ok...AWESOME],"Amazon Sent Me A Warning E-Mail That The Product Had Not Shipped But, I Had ALREADY Recived The Produt EARLY, And In AWESOME Condition To Boot!! I Had Very Low Expectations On Receiving A Used Gaming Book, But Other Than Slight Page Wear, And A Crease On The Back Cover, The Book Is In Better Condition Than Most I Have Found Used In Gaming Stores Locally. Thanks For The Cheap Price As Well.[I Paid MORE For Shipping Than The Book]"
5,slap those strings ike!,"ike turner may have treated tina wrong, but he treats a guitar right! raw voice with the great guitar playing, mix in some gospel styling, throw in some funk, and put it all together with some flat out, righteous blues!"
5,Great book.,I liked the book because it helps with my course. It really works well in the sense that it reenforces material covered inclass.
3,average,"It helps somewhat. I can't say it does what it says. My fingers crack and bleed in the cold winter weather. It does not stop that. Other than that, it absorbs really well."
5,This is the best,"The skin on the sides of my fingernails crack in the winter (I live in Michigan). I spent a lot of money trying this cream and that. Miracle Hand Cream is the only thing I've found that works. Given time (used several times daily for about a week) it will heal the cracks. If you rub it into your hands most nights before you go to bed, you will not develop any dry skin cracks.There is no pain killer in it, so additionally, you'll have to use hydrocortisone on the cracks till they stop hurting. But the hydrocortisone by itself won't heal anything. Miracle Hand Repair Cream will."
2,cream,this product does not work like it is advertised on tv. i would not buy it again. it does not repair your hands like it says it will do !
3,great product---service HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this lotion....BUT I ordered it on Dec 29 and didn't receive it until February 1. My credit card was charged immediately for it. I was supposed to receive it Jan 3-6. Never got it or any notification about it. Will never order from this company again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Review of miracle cream,The sample product I tried was much better than the product I purchased. It feels greasy.
5,Great Service,"Sentimental Journey was a special purchase by me for use with my parent's 60th anniversary celebration. I couldn't find it locally. I ordered it, got it promptly and it's a good quality collection."
5,She is a Great Singer.,Doris is a great singer and actress. She is good at the making of mood.This Box set includes 4CDs and a commentary book. It is a very precious thing.
1,Coolpix battery charger,This purchase was an absolute waste of money. I threw out the packing material before I realized what an inferior product I had purchased. The batteries hold little charger. The charger broke after 3 uses. Complete was of $$. The camera itself is a jewel. The charger is absolute junk.
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this recharger believing that it would give me more pictures between recharges...in reality, it was worse than regular batteries!!! Don't buy it or buy it from a store that will accept returns because you will."
1,Disappointing and frustrating product,"This product is just awful. The batteries don't take very long to charge, but once they're in my camera, I can only take about 15 or 20 pictures before the juice runs out. And if I charge the batteries, put them in the camera, but don't use it right away, the next time I turn it on I have a low battery. It's been extremely frustrating, and I am definitely going to try a different brand. Anything would be better than this."
1,waste of money,Bought this with my Coolpix 2100. Battery life is awful. Regular AA's take more pics. Save your money on this garbage.
1,Piece of junk,"This is my second purchase. It does the same, the batteries can't get charged. The light indicated that the batteries are full during the charging process (2hours as indicated); but once inserted in the camera you have the same message ""batteries exhausted"". This is stupid and crazy !!!"
5,Great Record,"Excellent electronic soundtrack for trips of all kinds - on the road and otherwise. More like a cartoon than their other three CD's (at least as of 2001), these songs tend to be slightly more punk-rock and fun than the others - even if they are less complex in a musical sense. From the perspective of a long-time fan, this is a great place to start listening to Babyland."
4,Fun and Provoking...,"I wandered into the Camera Theatre, decided to check this out, and was pleasantly surprised... It's a fun horror film that's not cheesy like you would expect for an indie flick. I'm not the type to get scared at the movies, but watch horror for the comedic value, and I more than got my money's worth... It has a nice blend of Shock, One-Liners, and some great laughs... A great movie worth watching."
1,Complete garbage,"I love B movies, but this low budget film is just a piece of garbage. The acting is worse than a junior high drama, the characters are totally unbelieveable. The editing and directing make this movie so boring that you'll be lucky if you don't doze off. The sad part is that the plot could have made a really great movie. I've seen a lot of bad movies and usually they are good for even a few laughs, but this one got shut off halfway through and I should probably just burn the disc so no one else has a chance of accidently stumbling upon it and watching it."
1,go for name brand,from day 1 it seems I am running out of ink.l I always try and save a buck or two when I can but don't waste your time or money
4,Its alive my old HP Deskjet 695C!!! Im in college again!!!,Its a grate pleasure put operative my old printer. My HP Deskjet 695C was my undergraduate tesis printer. I have a lot of bad experiences with original HP Cartriges and i don't want waste more money. For me its a great deal. But the delivery get a lot of hits. But the internal packaging resist and all its ok now after a little bit of cleaning.
5,Great iPad stand,"This is a great, cheap, light, sturdy, durable, portable iPad stand. It is the right size for almost any angle in either portrait or landscape, and the iPad is held sturdily enough to be tapped and used while in the stand. Available angles are endless, and work for typing with the on-screen keyboard, using the iPad as a laptop with an external keyboard, or watching movies. Basically, this stand is useful in any scenario.The 2AX model is wider, but I see no reason to get anything wider than this 2A model."
5,Amazing,Best tablet stand ever. And with two I keep one at my computer desk and one at my work desk for movies.
4,Glug,"Gosh, I remember this. The theme song is something to do withSalmon, I think. Salmon, whose mating cry is 'apusski-apusskidu'. I'mnot entirely sure, as it was a long time ago, and I'm only reviewing this to show that somebody, somewhere has heard of / been subjected to this book."
4,Surprising front-end centric balance,"I was surprised by how much material there is on the front-end of the J2EE equation. About half the book is spent on the front end with excellent chapters on JSP 2.0, JSTL, Servlets and front-end security.Attention is also paid to the back end. Chapter 11, which weighs in at 50 pages out of 900, is on EJBs and the various O/R mapping and persistence objects. The back end coverage then continues on with chapters on messaging, XML processing, and web services.This is not an all-in-one book. The coverage, with perhaps the exception of the front end, is not thorough enough to replace a full book on any one of these topics. In particular the chapter on persistence is far too brief for any thorough explanation of the topic. That being said this does act as a solid field guide to provide an end-to-end view of the landscape of J2EE development."
2,Very simple,"Professional to Expert? Only an overview on the j2ee.I am wondering about the contents of the ""beginner to professional"" book...Give it a try if u want to have a light explanation on j2ee key tecs.Example: the chapter Using EJB Container Services starts from page 621 and ends at page 653. Everyone knows that arguments like Security services, Transaction Services, Scheduling, Instance pooling and caching worth more than 30 pages...J2EE bible is still the best tutorial/reference for a professional."
3,Good for a J2EE novice - more focus on the front end,Lots of editing mistakes - could have been a lot better only if there were lesser errors in the code as well as explanations. Also they need to focus more on the back end J2EE equally well as they have done for JSP/jstl/servlets. Hope they do a better job with the JEE 5 release.
2,I just didn't like it,I read the amazing reviews and decided to try it out..to me it just smells like its made for an older crowd.I actually decided to give it to my grandmother for Christmas and I think she'll like it a lot.its not the worst perfume ever but its just not for everyone.
1,got questions? pay $10 for each and every call for assistance!,"I will definitely NOT buy this product. I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service. This is totally ludicrous, and the support service should be included with the purchase of the product. Apparent Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking is trying to squeeze every nickle and dime out of their customers. I refuse to by any product by a company that will do that to their customers. I think this is about the ONLY company that charges for their support. Try to find an alternative voice recognition software company who will support their product free of charge. SHAME ON YOU, NUANCE DRAGON NATURALLY SPEAKING."
2,Decent at best,"I am not going to bother going over the story. It's a revenge story, and it's really badly done. The kung fu though, is decent. Chi Kuan Chun is the lead actor, and he gets to show off quite a bit. Champ Wang looks good. Chia Kai looks good, but is way underused. Steve Tung Wei also stars and gets to throw down in the finale. So to sum it up briefly, the kung fu is just a tad above average, there is not a great quantity of fights, but enough of them, and the movie is just godawful as a whole.2/5The Groundzero DVD is watchable."
2,"old ""skool"" kung Fu","The transfer from VHS to DVD, very dissapointing. I watch this flick twice, and still don't get it!! A painful experience."
1,Unbelievably bad video quality!,"So far, this DVD has the worst picture quality I've ever seen - image is washed out, blurry, and noisey. Source material must have been a 3rd generation copy (at least)that's been played so often that the tape is deteriorating. The manufacturer should be ashamed!"
3,A Fair Movie,"This movie stars Chi Kuan Chun whom I prefer more in supporting roles. It is a solid movie,but lacking in some areas. The plot pretty much revolves around trying to find out the identity of the evil murderer named Golden Mask. The movie does have a few twists and turns and is a well done solid movie."
3,A Very Good Book!,"I couldn't say that this was the best in the series b/c i havn't read all of them, but this book was the best out of the five i read... yeah i know only FIVE, but thats because they are no where to be found. I don't know why this book is out of print, the baby sitters club is just as old but it's still out on book store shelves! i wish this series would go back in print. I wish i didn't start reading these because i got so hooked on them!!! ok anyways this book was really touching, i even cried. Jana gets upset when she hears laura McCall talking in the hall about randy(jana's b/f), jana thinks laura wants to take him away from her. When she spots randy and laura sitting together at bumbers jana gets mad and runs out of bumbers away from randy, she doesn't see the oncomming car but randy does. He pushes jana out of the way but gets hit himself. Randy goes into a comma and jana blames herself for the accident. thats what mainly the book is about this IS a MUST READ!"
5,I LOVED IT,IT IS THE BEST ONE OUT OF THE SERIES SO FAR.WHY IS IT OUT OF PRINT.SHE SHOULD WRITE MORE I LOVED THEM.
2,Save Your Money,"I brought this toy for my child she only play with it for about fifteen minutes and after that the toy end up on the floor. You couldn't hear music, pooh's voice and also thier was no action with the toy."
2,Can't hear it,I got this for my 20 month old and my 9 month old. Neither one has touched it. It might be cause you can't hear it.
2,toys,Like everyone else I changed the batteries thinking they had worn out but nope after changing them it was still hard to hear. Just might have to return it.
2,Not a good buy,"My daughter usually likes such phone toys, pushing the buttons, etc., but there is something seriously wrong with the volume on this thing. I think maybe I got a bad phone, because I even changed the batteries and the volume is still very very low. You have to actually turn the phone over and put the speaker right to your ear to hear it. So, my daughter never plays with it. I'm thinking of just throwing it away. I suggest testing this at the store first to make sure the volume is acceptable."
4,Pooh Phone,I like the toy except for the Winnie and The Honeycomb are very hard. My child hit herself in the head with it when she first got it. I just wish that they could have been softer. The volume could be louder too.
2,Barely A Summertime Beach Read,"In retrospect, I should have expected this book to be as poorly written as it is. In the course of 300 pages, Professor Geisst attempts to provide the history of approximately 17 banking houses --- which translate into about 18 pages per house. (As a comparison -- Ron Chernow dedicated over 700 pages to the Morgan dynasty in his book. Imagine trying to condense that down into 18 pages). To call such treatments superficial is an understatement. Additionally, the book suffers from organizational flaws, particularly toward the beginning of the work. One even wonders if significant portions of The Last Partnerships were merely taken from Geisst's earlier work, Wall Street: A History, and shuffled around to create a new book."
3,Poetry of the middle-range,"This book is quite moving in parts, and Di Piero is obviously a very competent poet. His ""less is more"" aesthetic, however, often leads him to write boring poems in flat language. His ""tell it like it is"" attitude kept me interested enough to finish the book, but eventually I felt that original use of language and a willingess to risk experimentation needn't be sacrificed for ""emotional honesty."" Sometimes less is just less."
5,A great case,"What can you say about a case? Basically, this is a handsome, authentic Sony leather case that seems very well manufactured and ably protects my Sony DSC-P150. It's very sturdy and grants easy access to the camera. While it encases the camera very nicely and snugly, it is a bit bulkier than the camera itself so don't expect a skin tight fit.The little accessory case that comes with the camera case is a nice touch for storing memory sticks and batteries. It also has a neck strap for the camera. All in all, this seems the nicest of all the P150 cases out there and has served me very well on some accidental drops. I highly recommend it."
5,Sony LCS-PHE Soft Carrying Case for DSCP100/P150/P200 Digital Cameras (Leather),A very nice case. Fits perfectly and it's easy to get the camera in and out in a hurry.
2,Not Really Earthworm Jim...But Pretty Close,"This game follows the TV show, and it was okay. What's strange is that you have to pick this coins or icons of somekind in order to finish the level. That was kinda pointless! This game should be rented, not bought. =|"
1,Very Bad,"I would rate this 0 stars if I could. The production is bad, the music is bad, and I am actually in the process of sending it back. Information provided in the DVD was almost useless, as it focused more on the guide catching fish, than teaching the audience his technique and what works and why."
3,Jackory,"The White Ninja just wasn't as good as it was supposed to be. It had all the elements to become a great third volume, but the focus and the structure simply drifted away. Although writing is superb, the story line was often directed into mundane and non-central characters. In my estimation, the book had 5-6 parallel story tracks, out which Nicholas's track got about 20% of ""air time"". To me that was way too little for the main character to have, especially since his story line was the most interesting to me (and that of Nangi's, but that became also incredulous after the midpoint of the book). It seems that Lustbader has become more concerned with length of a book than tightly written story, a sort of Tom Clancy syndrome (with his latest books). Less is more is a good way of putting it, after reading some 650 pages of the White Ninja."
2,Just not good enough,"Maybe it's my adult tastes. I'd picked this book up after several years to finish it off, I'd started with The Ninja back when I was a teenager, and I feel like I've grown up with the hero of the book, Nicholas Linnear. I was told there's now 5 books in the series. I just hope the rest aren't like White Ninja. Though a wonderful writing style, I found the book lacked imagination. Some of the scenes became so unrealistic, put there to inject a sense of drama and climax, but looking out of place. The climax to the book by the way was awful. What a complete disappointment. It slowly builds, then nothing. Nicholas does his usual three fingered gut thrust and monkey blow, but no twists, nothing that makes you think wow, that was a good read."
5,Exciting!,It's a good book. This is the first Martial Art story I read with the mystical aspects of the Art. Bewarned! That mystical thing was all just made up. It was there for fictional purposes only.
4,The last GREAT Nicholas Linnear novel,I LOVED 'The Ninja' and 'The Miko'... 'White Ninja' is the last GREAT Nicholas Linnear novel. Nicholas faces marital troubles when his past Japanese flame returns... Very detailed descriptions of the mountains in Japan... makes you wish you were living there...
1,Too long and too boring.,This was pathetic. I HAD TO skip some parts. It was just TOO LONG AND NOTHING HAPPENED. What was he thinking when he made this book. I think that Lustbader is running out of ideas and FAST so he puts together whatever he can and comes out with this garbage. The end was bad and the fight scenes did not make sense to me at all. I have a good imagination and I crave action but this was stupid.
3,Great at the Time; Doesn't hold up; maybe I've aged,"I was 22 when this first came out and thought it was a very emotional and sensuous movie. The ending produced a tremendous feeling of sadness which stayed with me for years. I recently saw it again. Disappointingly it has one of the most erotic scenes edited. The trick of showing time passing by having a picture boat glide across a picture ocean really seems corny. For a better Sarah Miles movie which holds up for its eroticism and story quality, I'd recommend ""Ryan's Daughter""."
1,This is cut!,All the scenes containing adult material are edited and cut.I reccomend you to protest this and wait for an uncensoured version.
4,Fabulous!,"I couldn't disagree more with the editorial review published here.I thought this was a fascinating film in a lot of ways. A bit rough in the structure, at times, but overall a very good effort. Some wonderful performances, interesting plot, beautiful scenery."
2,too much pretentious,"This film is a failure, I think because surely it's based over a complex novel. Cinema is good for action and image, but surely has his limits. I don't know the original book of Mishima, but all these is evident. The movie show us, not one, but two stories and truly there's no much cohesion between the two: the children's gang and his chief -a little Hitler-, and the history of the widow and the sailor. These two tales doesn't attain to make a full unity, but remains as two different histories without no much relation though full of pretentions and false steticism. Probably at his time -1976- this movie was very daring owing the nudes of Sarah Miles, but this is another tale."
3,"Shoking Then, Shocking Now","""The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea"" was a shocking film when first released in 1976 because of its blend of sex and mystery-bred tension. The newly-released DVD is very high quality and the content--based on Yukio Mishima's novel--remains erotic and scary. The performances are very good, with Sarah Miles especially showing her strengths (and lots of other things). The film is polarizing; many will stop watching in the first 30 minutes, but most will find it captivating."
2,Last time I saw at theater - it was too hot for it's time!!!,"Ok - so I was in my late puberty years and Sarah Miles was the hottest thing on my mind - (BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE) - I cannot forget this flick! You better be in check with your Fraudian side to handle this oddity. Overall - a stinker! BUT - it tested it's era of censorship. It was closed down quitely because it was too hot for it's time! The media posted alleged reports of Kris Kristofferson's marital breakup as a partial result of the filming of this with Sarah Miles - later. There was a photo spread in at least one magazine - later. I am going to buy this one just to see if it gets me as moved as it did in the mid 70's! There must be some reason this flick has stayed in my mind all these many years, besides sexy Sarah."
4,WebDB Bible,A well written book. It covers WebDB fairly well. The disk attached to it has a large assortment of component examples on it which are helpful. The only concern I had with the book was that it did not have sufficient detail in the types of applications you could make with it as a developer!I have seen a demo of 3.0 and it rocks. Hopefully a new Bible will come out soon to cover it!
5,I highly recommend the Oracle WebDB Bible,"With the help of the Oracle WebDB Bible, I was able to transform a small 'Mom and Pop' ecommerce site, to a robust, data-driven machine. The authors convey technical concepts both concise and clear. This book stays on my desk."
3,Web-DB Review,"The Book is good, the content is good, by oh g#$ the authors' of this book have verbal diarrhea. What could be conveyed in two or three sentences take 1 to 2 pages; but then again maybe it's just me."
1,Technical Disaster,After Purchase of this book I found that it requires Windows NT to run. I found an NT box. Placed the CD Rom from the back of the book in the drive to run Setup.exe. Setup.exe is not on the cd-Rom. The website states that at the last minute the publishers decided not to include it. The publishers have dedicated a website webdb-bible.com to assist with all the technical short comings of the product. Technical work arounds for this book are way too half baked. Leave this book on the shelf.
1,Don't waste your money - the authors cheat you.,"Ad soon as I loaded the CD-ROM I felt cheated. I bought the book because it promised a version of WebDB on the CD-ROM. Then, AFTER I had loaded the CD-ROM,(and too late to get my money back), the read.me tells you that 'at the last minute' they decided NOT to include WebDB ! They should not promise what they do not deliver.The link they give to get the download does not work. When you finally laboriously find your way to the download site you find that it's almost 100Mb, which takes a lot of time and money from London,England. I know there are many people who have reported problems installing WebDB and I was looking forward to following the book's step-by-step installation procedure to be sure it would work. So now, for the first time, I will try to get my money back from Amazon, with a book with the CD-ROM pack opened !"
1,This book should be discontinued !!!,"1)The Oracle WebDB is no longer available for download orpurchase.2)The preface of the book gives some non-working URL's todownload a trial version of the software or updates to theincluded CD-ROM.3)The preface of the book is stating:""The CD-ROM attached to the back cover of this book provides atrial copy of WebDB ..."" - false4) I contacted the authors about this, NO answer at all.5) ..."
2,Not very impressed,"I purchased this item as a gift for my wife, and was quite disappointed.Despite the item's description, the pearls were all irregular and not well matched. They were also dull in appearance and had very visible flaws.Admittedly, at this price point, you're not going to have a perfect strand of pearls. However, a side-by-side comparison with the14k Yellow Gold Akoya Cultured Pearl 6.5-7mm Necklace and Stud Earring Setshowed that the Akoya set had pearls that were all round or near-round, very well matched, and were not noticeably smaller than this necklace. Not to mention the price was about the same, and you get matching earrings."
1,Please don't waste your money,I love my little Amy Winehouse. I'm a sucker for anything with her name on it. I want you to benefit from my experience. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. I actually put it in the trash. Very bad voice over- set to photos. No recent or new information.
1,Winehouse Fan? save your money.,"I purchased this DVD with low expectations. Shockingly, even those low expectations were beaten hands-down by what I saw. I'm a huge Amy Winehouse fan, and have various collections of TV shows, concerts, etc. This was by far the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. All it consists of are a few photos of Amy (no 'live' footage whatsoever) with a cheesy voice over droning on about irrelevant things to fill up the time. This is NOT a documentary by any stretch of the imagination. There is no film of Amy, no video excerpts, no concert footage, no interviews with anyone - nothing. Go check out youtube - someone will definitely have done a better job than whoever created this."
5,Disc of The Year,"It will be a tall order to top this recording as Disc of The Year. Dave Holland's ""Prime Directive"" is close, but this CD is full of vibrant ensemble play that rises a notch above anything else out today. Murray puts his personal stamp on some of my favorite Coltrane tunes. His tenor on ""Naima"" is absolutely beautiful. I have not heard a more energized version of ""India"" since Jack Dejohnette recorded it with his Special Edition group back in the 80's. Who else could have delivered ""A Love Supreme"" in such a streched out fashion, that you would have to hear it twice to really appreciate the incredible arrangements. This is a great CD. I could not believe the beautiful humor that Murray offers up on his bass clarinet. Flashes of Eric Dolphy are wonderfully woven into his improvisations. After listening to CD from end to end, close your eyes and the smiling face of John Coltrane will pop into your mind. Great job Mr. Murray. You have left me wanting more. Enjoy!"
5,The best Batman betrayal story since BATMAN HUSH!!!!!!!,"I know that many of the other comic book critics thought that this onewas lame,but I on the other hand did not!As a matter of fact,I foundthis comic book story to be the best betrayal story since BATMAN HUSH!The artwork by TONY WONG is gorgeous,and the well-woven plot by DOUGMOENCH is for the most part well-written!And not only that,I have justfound my second favorite BATMAN villain in this story!CLAYFACE is#1 and(I won't tell you because it would spoil all of the plot in this one)is#2!I'm sorry about not talking about too much of the story,but if I did,then it would RUIN YOUR ENJOYMENT OF READING IT.There are that manysurprises that await you with this one!Don't miss out."
4,Good Book Great Art,"I enjoyed this. Forgive me for not being to descriptive but it was a very fun detective story with beautiful art.A nice long book too, that helps me feel good about shelling out the money.If you're more interested in Batman then you are criticizing comic books I think you'll like this."
2,feels like this one's been rushed,"Why did I pick up this comic up? The art apeared to be amazing, and it is, don't get me wrong. I was dissapointed with this graphic novel though, and I'll tell you why.The art that is painted is wonderful, but the problem is: less then half the comic is actualy painted. You'll find that only one panel every two pages is painted. The rest is pen and ink with bland pastel coloring.To say the least, the story is a bore. I love batman, if written well, but this story shouldn't have even left the thought process. I won't even bother to explain it. It's not a painful read, but it's deffinatly not enjoyable.Ending on good note, the painted art is amazing, and I'd love to see more of it."
3,CD rom problems,"Once installed the CD provides several good mini-programs. However, the programs require a small fee to continue use after 30 days. The links provided to get this continued use do not work. If you want to call France there is a number you can call. I do not recommend installing the software from the book."
5,Excellent Reference for a Complex Software,"I provide advanced Word support for a company of over 1,000 people, and this book is an invaluable resource for me. I recommend this book to anyone needing to learn more than just surface knowledge on Word."
5,Great,This is a great product. Doesn't flake or create a hard helmet on your head. Leaps and bounds above the hair gels of the past.
5,Skilled artist,"Yazz has very nice singing voise with full of power. And tracks like ""The only way is Up!"" are among the best. Not a perfect album, but good groove sound from the late 80'."
4,Behold Yazz!,"I've loved this album since it came out in the eighties. Yazz is a very talented dance music diva who probably gets confused in a lot of minds with Yazoo, the British synthpop duo who were popular around the same time(I believe they had to call themselves Yazz in the U.S. due to legal reasons). She sings about themes like ending poverty, standing up for your right to love whoever you want, being positive, etc. It's too bad there aren't more singers like this around now. Her dance tunes are funky and fun, with a message. The best are ""The Only Way Is Up,"" ""Stand Up For Your Love Rights,"" and ""Where Has All The Love Gone?"" She performs some lovely ballads as well, the standout is ""Fine Time"" though ""Got To Share"" is also nice. If you enjoy an upbeat message and great dance tunes, check this out."
5,Powerful Insights Into American Culture,"This is a very well written and fascinating book that exposes a side of American history that is little remembered today, but was a dominant strain in American culture in the teens and twenties, and exerted a shadow influence on American public policy for decades thereafter, if not until the present day. I discovered this book in the course of doing research for a writing project in my third year of law school -- it was not entirely on-point, but so engaging I couldn't put it down! Has some very helpful illustrations, too. Highly recommended.P.S. I don't understand the Amazon reviewer who criticized this book for its supposedly poor writing style. I am, alas, all too familiar with poor academic writing. Pernick, the author of this book, is first-rate, though admittedly, this is not a book for children."
5,"If you have the ability to read, read this.","If you want a game get this strategy based, farming game. Sound boring? it's not CHECK IT OUT, BLACK @NGEL"
1,incredibly boring,"when you first start this game it is kind of neat and It has good graphics, but if you like to play video games alot and constantly, this game is not for you. it gets boring really quickly and its the same thing over and over."
1,"Fun, but a real buzzkill too.","I had this game a while ago. I loved it almost as much as I loved the SNES version. I liked being able to play a girl, and to get a cat, and I also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good in-game profit WITHOUT the optional help of the sprites (all other HM recently, I've noticed you NEED them...I'd rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do it)...but I was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this game.And thats not the worst of it...This is a 'real time' game, and after a while, either it decides you're not playing enough, or the time system just breaks...either way, unless you play it almost nonstop, it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate you.Its good fun while it lasts...but it doesn't last long enough to even win it."
4,Interesting Game,"I have played this game, and it turned out to be very interesting. It is a game that you don't want to make too many mistakes on because your progress in the game depends what ending you'll have. After you finish the game, you can keep on playing the game too, so you don't have to start a new game. All the bugs in the GB version were fixed in this version, so there shouldn't be anything wrong. It is a good game for those who have patience."
4,get jiggy down on the farm,"This game is one of the better Gameboy titles out there, however, it is more of an adult game.You are a solo farmer trying to make a dead farm productive. The days pass by, seasons change, and all the while you attempt to grow crops and raise livestock. It takes awhile, but once you get things going you can have some fun."
5,Loads of fun,I originally bought this game for my son who is 13 and crazy about farming. My daughter decided she wanted to play too. They both like it. I have to admit I am addicted to it too. Lots to do and the character is cute. I would highly recommend it to all.
4,It's great... for a while,"When I first bought Harvest Moon for GBC it was really exiting. You get to water your crops and buy animals but after a while it starts getting old. There are not many places to go in the GBC version. If you are looking for long-term gameing, buy the Nintendo 64 version or the Super Nintendo version. (Trust me I own all three ;-))"
4,pretty good,this game is really fun and cool in the beginning but after 5 years its a little less fun. it would be more fun if you could get married. but if you are an older gamer 13+ this game is fun and addictive
4,Farming comes to your gameboy....,"I got this game b/c I was looking for something different. Well, that is exactly what I got.Harvest Moon is a game definitely aimed at the older crowd; I don't think kids will have a lot of fun with it.You begin with the task of clearing up the land around your farm. This task takes awhile and is tedious, but once you get that done the fun begins.Planting crops becomes the main activity of the game, but there are other things to do. You have a year to make the farm successful, and the days pass quickly. You can also purchase livestock to make the money really roll in. It takes time though, to accumulate the funds to buy animals, so be patient.Buy this game if you are not a kid."
4,"Harvest Moon.....Good on the GB, but could be better","Harvest Moon for the Gameboy is a really good game. It is fun and passes the time. However, it is far from its N64 and SNES cousins in gameplay. Despite this, it has many secrets, great graphics, and plays really well. Sim and RPG(role/playing game) lovers will love this title while younger children and favorers of action/shooting games should stay away from this game.....very far away. The game is more suitable for Gameboy Color owners, since those with regular GB would not be getting the most favorable experience with the game. I liked this game because it was challenging and very addictive. If you liked this game, try Survival Kids for the and the Legend of the River King for the GB and GBC."
3,An ok game,"Harvest Moon for the Game Boy started out as a boring game where you just planted seeds and bought stuff at the town. Until after a long time, the game got pretty interesting. I got to own animals, ride the horse, and do things like that. I ignored the game for a while because it was really boring and there was nothing to do, but then I tried it out for a couple of hours and found that it did get quite interesting.Overall, this game was all right and a good waste of time :op. Harvest Moon did get interesting because of all the new things that happen, but you keep doing the same things over and over again. So, in a way it was interesting and in a way, boring!"
4,"A Good game, but Harvest Moon 64 is better.","This is a game boy version of the hit game series Harvest Moon, and is good to some extent but lacking in certain things. You can't get married or own animals in this version. Other things are missing as well. If you want a good version of Harvest Moon, buy Harvest Moon 64. It is by far the best game I've ever played. If you have a Playstation and not a 64, a Harvest Moon for the Playstation Game Counsole is coming out soon. If you really want a Game Boy version, a Harvest Moon GBC 2 is coming out soon also, and is supposed to have all the features of Harvest Moon 64. I recommend buying one of these three games, but if you really want the first Game Boy Version, then go ahead and buy it. It won't be as good as the others, but you still won't be dissapointed."
3,A Door Stop,"It seems that some Authors don't take the time to run their code...This book is riddled with code examples that leave out key components.Example: Ch.7.7 - ""Displaying Images from a Database in a Web Forms Control""The code behind references Web Form objects that were never discussed. (Surprise!)If you're looking for an abbreviated book on ADO.NET ""Concepts"", and don't really care about actually seeing working code, then this book is ok. If you need a concise guide, then don't bother. This book requires the reader to take a lot for granted."
2,Problem - Solution,"I find this book to be totally unsatisfactory at providing an understanding of ADO.NET. Rather than attempting to teach the reader the basics, the author provides a series of problems with possible solutions. Additionally, what information the author does provide to the reader is given in sequential order, bouncing around from fact to fact in a way that would make it extremely difficult to retain the information. It's a bit like trying to read a dictionary one word after the other and expecting that the readers memories are nothing less than perfect. The examples provided do provide readers with a reasonable solution; but, unless you want to thumb through the series of problems and solutions, this book just won't cut it. If you're after a real understanding of ADO.NET, look elseware. If you're after an example based understanding (one that can only get you as far as the examples took you), this might be the book you're looking for."
2,Mindless fluff,"Utterly transparent plot and a 5th grade reading level make up That Camden Summer. Granted I didn't expect it to be fine literature, but I'd have liked some originality of characters and story. If you want to read something that's easy reading and doesn't tax your brain then this is the book to read."
5,Totally love the character of Roberta Jewett,"I loved the book - and this is the first I've ever read of Lavryle Spencer. So I'm ready to dive in to all her other books now, based on how much I enjoyed this one. I won't go into the details of the story because so many other reviews have. But I loved the setting - both geographically and historically. And I love the heroine of Roberta Jewett. She is a woman I could definitely see using as a role model. What a wonderfully sweet book in so many ways. I definitely will recommend it to others."
2,"Did not like it, different from all her other books","The fact that it had a rape that was described in detail really upset me.I felt that it was not essential for the story for her to be so graphic.NOT HER USUAL STYLE.I have read all her other books and had to force myself to read this one.My favourite LaVyrle Spencer books are ""Family Blessings""""Bittersweet"" and ""Morning Glory"""
4,A Summer to Remember,"All I can say is what a story, the plot is well conceived and it stands out as one of the best books I have read in a long time. Each character comes to life from the pages and they take form right before your eyes, it's as if you can see them in a picture. The individuality of them makes it a diverse field. The story as a whole brings to mind the tials of life (especially for a woman) in the 1920's. The power of it makes it very hard to put down and it's kind of sad when it has to end and the dreamworld is over..."
3,Not as good as some of her other books.,"This was an interesting story. I felt like I had just entered a zoo. It is not a book I would keep for rereading though, because the heroine was such an airhead. Her other books grab at your soul and I feel that Ms. Spencer just didn't have enough depth to this story."
3,tHaT cAmDeN SuMMeR,"I read That Camden Summer over Spring Break on the plane. It was a good story, I just thought it was a little predictable. Maybe it was supposed to be like that, but I would have liked something a little more fun. Overall it was a good story."
5,WOW!!! What a story.,"I had back surgery Oct 1998 and needed something to read while laying around afterwards. I went to the local Safeway and found this book, not reading the preview on the back I liked it from the start just because of the cover. What I had no idea was I would not put it down except to eat and use the facilies. Thanks L. Spencer for the wonderful heroin, Roberta Jewett, you brought to life in That Camden Summer. :) You really know how to make your readers feel part of the story. I could almost smell the roses in Gabes backyard."
2,"A shameless upsell atempt, very little substance.","I've bought and read all of Dan's No B.S. books and was very dissapointed with this one. While he does promote his books and services in the other books, it's not in a blatant hard sell fashion as in this book. So much so, the whole book seems to be a tease and a marketing attempt for his inner cicle's services.Nonetheless, I'd give Dan the benefit of the doubt, he is after all a marketing guru. In fact, I got a lot of good ideas from his free newsletter. It seems to me, however, that ever since he partnered with Bill Glazer, everything that's published under his name is a non-stop commercial for the Kennedy inner cirlce."
2,Disappointed,"I am not sure if I should be disappointed with the book itself, or the fact that Dan Kennedy's students run around online giving all his products 5 star blindly.This book is NOT written by Dan Kennedy. Dan Kennedy only wrote the first chapter, and from that point on, each chapter contains teaser content and a plug for a different guru.This book has some nice overview of some examples, but it is not as good as the reviewers make it out to be. You will not get anything concrete out of it."
1,Dan Kenndey Should Be Embarrassed,"Dan Kennedy should be embarrassed that he actually charges money for this. The only information worth anything in this book are his 10 rules, which are summaried in the index. The rest of the book is a shameless sales pitch to get you to sign up for his seminars. Worse yet, he doesn't even write the biggest part of this book which are testimonials from other marketers that have attended his seminars. Pathetic! This book is nothing but B.S. I'd like a refund Dan!"
2,lots of hype and upsells,"While this was the first Dan Kennedy book I purchased, it is also the weakest. While it does have some original content, most of what is written is recycled from the older books. The main purpose of this book is to make the author a 'credible' source so you will join the mailing list and buy more products (and more and more.....). Having read Dan's sales letter book and his marketing book, i would suggest those over this. They are much less 'sales-ie' and have most of the same information."
2,No BS? Really? This Book Stinks Of Complete Bull,"Dan Kennedy has the gall to call this No BS. This book is full of crap. The minute you open the cover, you can smell it. He gives the reader nothing to take home and really sink their teeth into. Nothing specific. Hell he didn't even write the damn thing. He just installed some of his Inner Circle gang to write each chapter. Probably so they can then claim that they were in a book by Dan Kennedy. Go buy another book. Go buy another Dan Kennedy book. Just stay away from this one. The stink is just not worth it."
3,"some great content, but most of it is trying to upsell","just a regular book, with a few great content and the rest is trying to upsell the other authors books or programs."
4,Another winner from Dan Kennedy.,Good information in a quick read. I read it in about 3 sittings. The first part of the book is good solid advice. The second is examples from successful people that have implemented Dan's tactics.All good stuff. Pick it up.
3,Micro Touch works OK,This about the third or forth time I have replaced this type of groomer.This one does not have a light.
3,Hair groomer,"nice for trimming hair from ears and nose, Not much use for facial hair. Much better price than on TV ad."
5,My hubby loves his micro touch trimmer,My hubby was looking for a trimming machine.We have purchased about 3 different kinds from the local stores and it never lasted for 3days.Then I checked here and discovering Amazon sells them too and even better. He enjoys his micro touch trimmer alot.It still works and he hopes it last.
4,Husband loves it,I bought this for my husband. He uses it all the time for various parts that are too sensitive for the close shave of a razor.
1,piece of junk,"This product is a piece of garbage.When it works, it does what it is suppose to do. However, it worked for the first two weeks and then totally died on me.Do not buy this product."
1,MOTOR IS A DUD,"While the product works it's good. It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair. The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless. It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality."
2,Bait and Switch,"I ordered the micro touch trimmer thinking I was getting the one in the picture. I received a ""new"" model instead and it doesn't work nearly as well as the older model. The speed of the motor is quite a bit slower and the battery life is about 1/2 of the older model. I would not recommend the new and improved trimmer to anyone."
3,"Great, but only when it works.","I have a love hate relationship with this product. When it works, it works great, but it breaks frequently. I lost track of how many I have bought and I am losing my patience. I'd pay $30 - 50 for a durable version of this product. Please someone make this NOW."
1,useless toy,"I received the trimmer and put in the battery that came with it, and it ran for about 5 seconds. I thought perhaps the battery was old, so I swapped in a new battery. The second time, it ran for about 4 seconds. I threw it away and will not bother to order another one."
2,horrible quality,"A poor product. Very hard to even turn the lever to the ""on"" position. Even at that, the unit only comes on half the time. Confirms what many have written, do not waste your money."
1,Bad Customer Service,"RE:Seller Response: ""Buyer didn't return item to us. Used a return labe provided by another seller. "" Date: February 28, 2011This is the seller's response to my previous review? I used the label THEY sent to me in a PDF. I still have the email - it has EbuyAlways as the addressee. Caveat emptor people - I will EbuyNever again.Thanks Amazon, for your A to z guarantee - I'm glad you know what good customer service is."
2,Not pleased...,"The reason I decided to purchase this product was because the trimmer in the picture is slim and compact. I needed a slim, compact trimmer that would fit well in my travel case. The trimmer I received is nothing like the trimmer in the picture. It's not the same trimmer at at. Same brand, but totally different. It is bulky and that defeats the purpose for me. I already have a bulky trimmer, I wanted a slim one.As for functionality, it's not the worst...but still rather unimpressive. It makes a great deal of noise, but doesn't remove much hair. It doesn't cut as close as I would like it to either...it leaves stubble and I end up having to finish the job with a normal razor, which is hard when your just trying to touch up. When shaving with the little light on the device becomes how very quickly.All and all, I am not pleased. To the seller, you need to update your pictures and send the item you show, not something different."
1,This is completely worthless,"Its super cheap, does not work at all, will struggle with the thinnest of hairs. Stay away!!!"
1,No good,Lousy product. Didn't work out of the box. Very flimsy construction. Rates less than one star.
2,A bad experience for me,"I bought one of these when they were advertised all over the tube a few years back. It costs as much as a better product (Remington MPT-3000 Precision Trimmer - MPT-3000 - see my review), it is made in China (no disrespect meant to Asia), and it took weeks to arrive.When it finally made its way across the ocean, it hardly lasted any time at all -- maybe a couple uses -- then quit working entirely. I would recommend you scrap the idea of responding to a TV ad for this and get the Remington above. You won't regret it."
3,Micro Touch Men's Electric Hair Groomer,Works like it says it does but only on fine hair. Not powerful enough to work on beard and mustashe areas.
3,"Great quality, but too small for my purposes","This is high quality (5 star), but a lot smaller than anticipated and has some rather large gaps between the straps as can be seen in the picture. I'll be using the Masterlock Cargo Net instead. Probably works great for a cargo as depicted."
2,Missed Opportunity,"Yes, the women are beautiful and some even look natural, but there are only 3 (out of 20+) who take off their little bikinis (and these are not the hottest or natural ones), and most didn't look very comfortable or practiced posing. I found the editing boring, repetative and silly... I found the tunes (somewhat vulgar to sappy rap and hip-hop) unlisteneable so the best way I found to watch the DVD was 2X fast forward....alas it was a missed opportunity with these beauties.(Instead of this I'd recommend Mystique's NATURAL NUDE BEAUTIES)"
1,JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR BUCKS,"I was for a long time searching for a guitar book at amazon's books when this item (and others more)came out, I thought it was a book+dvd, if so I found it very cool. For my surprise I realized that it was a dvd, so no matter I'll try it, I thought... Well, I just can say this is not a good stuff if you are looking for something to help improve your skills and knowledge don't try this nor any other product from these series Easy Guitar bla bla bla, don't tell that I didn't warn you!"
3,Excellent performances. Choice of songs not the greatest,"Mary Clere Haran has one of those exceptional voices that can make you fall in love with her even though you may have never been in her presence. I cannot fault any of the performances on this album. I do have an issue with the choice of material. I would place the majority of the material in the novelty category --- cute, likeable, songs but not the kind of material you want to return to frequently. I wish they had chosen more of the classic Gershwin songs sung by Ms. Haran in her exquisite, simple, direct delivery. Then this would have been an album for the ages."
4,The strength of this Salsa Tenor,This singer is to be commended! Not only is the voice even and smooth but it contains a ring not found in most salsa tenors today with the exception of Marc Anthony. George proves in this album a vocal strength that is pleasing to the ear esp. in Volver Amar; a song that is a challenge but George flies thru it with ease in his upper register. God Bless you Babe :)
1,Be careful of edition number!,"I ordered this book, not realizing it was the 2nd edition and not the third. Though Amazon had the third edition of the textbook, I was told when I called that they did not even carry the 3rd edition workbook yet. Before you order this, make sure it is the edition you need."
5,Essential Reading,"This book is one of the most important works about journalism and helps put all the nonsense found in today's ""news"" coverage into perspective. This is essential reading for anyone interested in political science, history, sociology and current affairs. It gets to the heart of how things have been covered and the lies we have been told - forever."
2,A snooze,"What a boring racing game, wow I was expecting more, if you want a good racing game go for Test Drive 6."
2,"Very stupid, look for something else","Tokyo Xtreme Racer's graphics are about the only thing good about this game. The stop-start gameplay is especially annoying. It is so boring and stupid, it has to be the WORST racing game to hit the Dreamcast. Skip this one, and take my advice. Look for Sega Rally 2, Speed Devils, TestDrive 6, anything but this."
1,worst game ever,this game sucks its not a real racing game i dont want to fell like im driving in the highway i wanted a league racer
4,Tokyo Extreme Racer,"If you are inspired by amazing graphics and realistic gameplay, don't miss this one! The rendering is amazing, up to the streaks your tail lights leave at night. TER offers both an arcade type and a quest mode for hours of play. Race against opponents, collect your credits and upgrade your vehicle (and there's plenty of them).On the flip side, as impressive as this game is, you are always racing at night. It would be nice to see some daylight once in a while (I guess no one comes out in the day in Tokyo). Also, running around on the same track loses it's excitement after a while. If not for the amazing graphics, this game would probably be a 3 star. Nevertheless, it's worth it, especially for all you auto enthusiasts out there!"
5,Extremely Underrated and Realistic,"Those are the 3 adjectives that describe tokyo extreme racer. Most websites and/or game magazines will say that the game is bad. I love this game to death. I love it more than i do sonic adventure. It's replay value is Off 'da hook! (if you like this concept) The game design and graphics are superb, and if you are an import car enthusiast like i am, you must buy a dreamcast and tokyo extreme racer. Right now in the game i have purchased a Nissan Skyline and an Acura NSX. the handling is very lifelike, and i actually think that it is a plus that your cars cannot get damaged, because in the game you spend so much money on them. Anyways, i love this game. You will too if you are into this. In other words: For enthusiasts only."
1,This is racing at its lowest.,"Honestly, who wants to drive the same EXACT track at night EVERY time you play it, and have it be a full game? That's gotta be the dumbest thing I have ever heard of."
3,patients is a virtue,"pros- cool import cars, ok graphics, the thrill of street racing, battle race mode. cons- nothing but import cars, awesome graphics... if it were a PSX game, one big track, not enough game modes, zero replay value (once i beat the game its was swapped out of my DC for soul caliber and hasn't seen the light of day since) my advise- wait for ""metropolis street racer"" or if your really hurting for a racer try ""test drive 6."""
1,"Boring, unrealistic",This game has only one track (Toyko). The driving is unrealistic. You have very limited control over the car. The cars are not typical cars you'd find in the U.S. I haven't played a racing game this bad in years!
2,"Nice graphics, few choices","The graphics are great but the limited track and repetitive route lead to a quick loss in interest. The great graphics and driving ""feeling"" are soon not enough to hold your interest. Also, there is no option to steer with either the thumb controller or the arrow pad, you are forced to the thumb controller which I do not prefer."
2,One dimensional game with little intrigue,"I found the control to be unresponsive, even after tweaking the settings. The graphics were dark and often confusing. There is only one course, the only option you have is which direction you got. The challenges and races were rather uninteresting. I doubt I'll be playing it very often."
5,Great Game,"This game is great with the different selection of cars and options on cars. It's great to race with my Acura NSX and then switch and race with my 300 Twin Turbo. The replay mode is also fun to watch and shows off the Dreamcast's abilities. The game really gets your blood pumping when in the middle of a race another car pulls out in front of you (kinda like real life) and causes you to go from almost winning to losing. The games does only offer two tracks (same track w/ different directions), but the track is several miles long and is fun to race on. Only problem w/ game is that there is noticeable slowdowns when there are 4 or more cars bunched together on the screen."
3,Nice graphics but...,Very good graphics (supposedly 60 FPS) but only one track and only at night. Replay mode is fun but very time limited. Skip this one and look for a better one.
3,Good game for the dedicated gamer,"I've had this game since it came out, and all I can say is that it's a good game, but only for the truly dedicated with very long attention spans. Why? Well, there are only two versions of the same track, and you can find yourself racing against the same opponents multiple times to save up money for cars and car upgrades. This game is great, however, if you like the ""thrill of the hunt,"" chasing down rival cars and challeneing them to highway drag races. The graphics are clean, but pale in comparison to other DC games, and slowdown does occur in rare instances. The control is good, but braking is totally useless in this game, so stick to letting go of the accelerator and steering clear. Buy this game if you're a hardcore racing game fan who ""races to race"" like myself. Otherwise, avoid this game."
5,Great Book,I first met the authors of this little gem at the New Hampshire Highland Games. I was impressed by their knowledge of the subject. This book has a way of making you feel like you are in the actual events of the story. They are great authors and I look forward to more of their books.
5,Love it!,"I have learned alot from this documentary, it is very informative. I'm sure that a lot of people don't know about the dinosaur and human footprints in the rocks side by side. Do you think it was his or her pet? I really liked this because I love science!! History, or discovery I am there."
5,A marvelous example of American engineering from the 50s,"I totally agree with Mr. Saemann's comments from several years ago, but I would only add that I am stunned by the quality of the monural recording and the beauty of the transfer. The performances are impeccable, but this CD is worth acquiring just hear from what the Capital engineers were producing 50 years ago (it truly puts many digital recordings from the 2000s to shame!). I'm sorry this release and others by Steinberg are again out of print. The ""Capitol"" series was a wonderful tribute to his art."
3,Not the most essential Tony Bennett songs,Disappointed with the selection. Should have read the jacket before I ordered. Not the best selections of his classic tunes. Give it a 3 on the star scale.
2,Another anthology???,"I am a huge Tony Bennett fan. I especially like his jazz albums and backup groups. Pianist Ralph Sharon so often sets the tone, I cannot imagine Tony without him. There are so many Greatest Hits anthologies out there. Columbia first issued the superb ""Jazz"" compilation, and the ""Forty Years"" 4-CD collection. All other anthologies are pointless, especially since his newer material is still widely available. Next, in rapid succession, have come ""The Ultimate"" and now ""The Essential"", replicating many tracks. Some of Tony's best albums have yet to be released in their entirety. What about ""When Lights are Low,"" named by biographer Will Friedwald as one of the best jazz vocal albums ever recorded, and ""My Heart Sings?"" I did manage to find on EBay a Japanese version of ""Tony Sings for Two,"" a duet with Sharon. This superb album has yet to be released stateside. We've only heard bits and pieces on compilation albums.Come on, Columbia! Why hold out on us?"
4,No one else like him,What a classic. This guy has been doing music since the 1950s. It is wonderful that so many generations can enjoy his music. This is a good essential double CD to get a good taste of timeless tunes.
4,A great sampler of a great singer,I can recommend this disc to anyone who loves a great performer. Even those who didn't or couldn't listen to him in his early years will love the tracks on disk one. The second doesn't need any further comment.
5,Tony Bennett,"I am familiar with Mr. Bennetts music and have always appreciated his style. It is even more important in this day and age since singers oft times talk words to a song or it is totally unintellageable.True singing is an art and Tony Bennett is a true artist and this C D has a broad spectrum demonstrating his ability.I highly recomend ""The Essential Tony Bennett"" for easy listening enjoyment."
5,Classic Bennett,"I have always dug His Material from the time I was a Kid to now.His Voice just struck a chord with my ears.this Double CD Set Captures so much of Him as a Artist.""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"" is my Song By Him.His Voice still has a Cool Richness about it to me."
5,OUTSTANDING,THIS CD IS FOR BOTH OLD AND NEW TONY BENNETT FANS. I PURCHASED THIS CD FOR MY 45 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. BOTH OF US SAW TONY RECENTLY AND WERE MESMERIZED BY HIS VOICE AT HIS AGE TODAY. THIS CD COVERS HIS EARLY WORK FROM THE FIFTIES AS WELL AS A LOT OF NEWER WORK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD.
4,A feel-good easy read.,"I would rate this book 5 stars for the enjoyment I received from it, but, the story takes place in the community in which I have lived for the last 48 years, & I realize it would not be quite so enjoyable for someone ""not from around here"". Both of my sons who do not like to read could not put the book down until they had finnished it. It is not only rivetting, but also teaches the reader something about the southwest, and Native Americans from this area."
4,"super southwest suspense. Hillerman, watch out!","When a body turns up missing on the way to the O'Otham funeral, a Tucson botanist moves into action.Fast moving, evocative desert drama, rings true"
5,very good - just oil & salt,"I used to eat another brand similar to this natural flavor, but it disappeared from shelves, so I tried the O.R. brand and liked it better. Now I'll need to order it from amazon because this has also been disappearing from my grocery store. I cannot understand everyone's fascination with the chemicals that go into 'butter flavor' microwave popcorn! This has just oil and salt, and I've found that pouring it into a large bowl reduces the saltiness that others have mentioned here. Keeping it in the bag to eat from seems to keep that salty flavor more concentrated. But I don't think it's really that salty anyway. Obviously this is quite the matter of taste."
3,Fair price but dated product.,"Probably will not be buying a food product on line again. Product is set to expire in a few months compared to the same product you find on the grocery shelf that typically has a minimum of six months. It doesn't pop up as well as the fresher product, so whatever I saved in dollars is lost."
2,The bags are oily,"I have bought this brand in the stores for several months and was happy to see I could get it with subscribe and save. But after this last order, I have cancelled my subscription, because EVERY bag in EVERY box was oily on the outside before even being popped. This is quite atrocious. I have not had this problem with the 6 count boxes I purchase in the store. I do not understand why it is like this, but I can't bring myself to continue purchasing this particular product in the 3 count boxes."
4,"Good, just a little oily & salty for my taste","Overall, it tastes pretty good. The pieces of popcorn are more oily than normal and a little saltier, but I have a low daily salt intake, so that could be the reason as well. I also boughtOrville Redenbacher's Smart Pop! 94% fat free butter microwave popcorn, 40 2.9-oz. bags 114 oz Boxat Costco and prefer it over the natural oil & salt, just because it is less oily and with the butter flavoring it is surprisingly less salty. Still a good product, it just comes down to your personal preference."
5,This is great popcorn,"This is great popcorn. I do not know why that in this day and age, most stores stopped carrying or do not carry natural popcorn. They have 90 different kinds of buttered. How different can it all be? Amazon is the way to go. I do watch what I eat and prefer this as a good snack."
2,"very greasy...yup, name is misleading","I bought this thinking it would be a healthy snack alternative. Plain popcorn is filling and a much better alternative to a bag of chips. This is not.The ""simply salted"" title is misleading. This product is perhaps the most greasy pre-packaged popcorn that I've tried. I needed a napkin before typing this review because my hands were too sticky to type. I know that there are plain microwave popcorns out there, but this is not the one if you want a healthy snack, which is seemingly how it is marketed.On the plus side, it tastes pretty good. Just wish I didn't feel like I ate a bag of potato chips after eating one serving."
2,"Good Popcorn, but.....","I loved the idea of a microwave popcorn without the ""butter"", but the ""simply salted"" in this case is a little misleading. It is ""very"" salty thus very high in sodium. Not for those of us with blood pressure issues. I'll got back to the Tender White variety which is very good."
2,Splits too easely,"Looks good, but when you trim it the ends of the strands come loose and the results look horrible. I used the old trick of using a match to ball up the individual fibers, but ended up using TY wraps to keep it together. Not exactly the look I was aiming for. I am using it for the time being but planing on replacing it with something more substantial. Not recommended if this is going to be seen."
3,If Storms hired a propagandist this is what they would write,"My son read this in college and LOVED IT. He insisted I read it. I think the difference in our opinion of the book has to do with a difference of 20 or so years experience as an engineer. I think if my son reads it again after 5 years in the work force his opinion will change somewhat. It could be a great book, but it is so entirely dedicated to giving Storms credit and defending him that the story is lost."
5,real story,"I found this book especially fascinating because it shows the race to the moon from a totally different perspective. Not the astronauts, not the people at huston mission control; the people who actually designed and developed that great engine that takes mankind to the moon. I am an engineer in space technology, and I can imagine (on a very, very limited scale, naturally !) what amount of work, dedication, and enthusiasm was necessary to do that job."
3,"Good sneakers, if you can get them on.","These are so tough to get on, even after a few weeks of wear. My son is 7 and he has the hardest time getting into them. Once they're on, however, he says they feel great, and it's the usual Geox quality."
4,Raw Soul,"This is one of the greatest live revue albums I've ever heard. Plus it gives the rest of the world, a chance to hear the raw soul St. Louisans have been privy to for years.It's not the smoothest, most polished live album, but from Tina's opening ""Hello everybody"", trying to get the attention of the audience to the last pounding beats of the band as the show ends, I was virtually transported to the Harlem Club, in St. Louis.Not only do you hear Tina at her funkiest, winning over the distracted audience, but they remaim captivated by an array of unknown, local talent that could stand up to any big named revue.Pay Special attention to Vernon Guy, Stacey Johnson, and Vanetta Fields. They gave me goose pimples with their gut-wrenching vocal masterpieces. And of course the tight, throbbing, and terrific, Kings of Rhythmn, tie it all together.The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because it's not smooth and perfect, from begining to end. Which makes it real, and mesmerizing."
3,Too dissuasive,"I'm glad I started to read this book after I bought my 911, otherwise I would never have bought the car. The book's approach to buying is ""If the car has problem x, then thank the seller and walk away"". The car I bought had many of the problems which the book mentioned, but my local garage solved most of them in a day and for less than 1000 euros/600 pounds/1000 dollars. I found the book to be an excellent guide to the different models and their differences, but the buying recommendations seem too stringent."
2,In desperate need of a copy editor,"Much good information here. Cost of repair information is excellent, but lack of frequency of repair information limits the value of said information. Way too much copy-and-pasting, and therefore not enough new information on each year and model. Also, enough editing mistakes and self-contradictions to call the whole enterprise into question. Two examples : Performance data in the article contradicts performance data in the data tables in more than one place. The parts list for the 1996 model has a great big label ""Parts List for 1975 911s."" Jarring.The annual ratings are only somewhat useful, as they compare that year's Porsche with other contemporary cars, rather than comparing 911s of different years to one another. If I'm trying to pick between two generations of 911, the ratings are not comparable between them.Again, much useful information that needs to be better organized and better edited. I look forward to the next edition."
1,Egregious Error,"I couldn't get past page 9 where the author, in discussing trailing PE ratios, attributes a remark made in 1987 to ""Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Alan Greenspan."" Greenspan, of course, has never even served on the SEC, much less chaired it. Sorry, but if the author can't get the basics right, the rest of the book is suspect."
4,Woman Love this album,"Put him in the overnight, quiet-storm, mid-day or whatever daypart and the woman will follow. Starting to get alot of request for Eshay."
2,EXPECTED MORE BASED ON THE TITLE,"This work is nothing more than a drawn on essay where it would be better suited as a single chapter in a true defensive handgunning text. The author who claims to have pioneered ""Point Shooting"" tends to repeat his methodology throughout the text whos subject (Instinct Combat Shooting) is simply point shooting renamed. It does serve in an introductory capacity for point shooting, however lacks the detail and diversity of methods employed by a multitude of ancillary police handgun courses. Based on the title this is what I had expected to read, however I was introduced to nothing new. Also lacks illustrations and photos to reinforce the technique."
4,Nice sound from a small package,Gave these to my parents who moved into a smaller 1-level villa. Space is a premium now and replaced their large speakers with these little guys. Better sound than the large speakers and a very crisp clean sound.No disapointments here.
5,Top speaker at this price,"I replaced my Allison speakers which I had for more than 10 years with these JBL's and couldn't be happier. Top of the line? No, but for the money they are simply the best choice. Listened to more than 20 speakers with cost up to $250 and these won out. Amazon had them for under $80!"
3,JBL Control 1X speakers,"In price vs. value, good purchase as speakers for kitchen stereo/tv. Vendor (Amazon/J&R) Excellent. Highly recommend J&R for electronics...check before you go to the Big Box or Discount stores"
2,Disappointing,"After reading all the great reviews, I thought I had found reasonably priced, good sounding small speakers for an extension of my stereo system to a second room. All I can say about these speakers is, ""You can hear the box."" Anyone who has heard speakers that are acoustically invisible will know what I mean. These are definitely not in the premium quality category. I guess for the price, I should not have expected so much."
1,these are not for monitors,"These are advertised as being for monitors - but they aren't. They are regular, split wire connections for a stereo. I had to return them because of that. If you want these for your computer FORGET IT! They aren't compatible."
1,Exasperating program,"In addition to all of the valid points mentioned in the other review on this site I found that this software seems very old... sort of as if it were written for Windows 95. It will only run from the CD drive and cannot be copied to run from the hard drive. The commands are not well labelled and are not intuitive. But the most maddening thing is that, while playing a game, it will sometimes spontaneously start some sort of auto play function and start making moves and just finish the game while you watch helplessly."
5,Scrabble Complete Review,This item was easy to play and was what I wanted. I would recomend this game to everyone that likes spend time olaying Scrabble.
4,Compatible with Windows 7,"Upgraded to Windows 7 and found that wireless adaptor we had wasn't compatible. After much searching, talked to Netgear tech help and they said this model was the only one that currently (11/09) is compatible. This was puzzling since 7 Beta has been out for months. They were right, as this WPN 311 did work fine with Win 7. The one that wouldn't work (Belkin) was only a few months old -- further proof that computers can give hearburn."
4,"Great card, iffy on 64bit Win7","I got this card to use in an older win7 64bit gateway desktop. Initially the connection dropped out constantly with the drivers from Windows Update. I ended up googleing and finding a Beta 64bit Vista driver. After installing it the card works perfectly. I wanted this card because it is supposed to work well with Linux, but haven't actually done that yet. Seems like a great card on most OS's, and even 64bit Win7 if you are pretty savvy."
3,A Promising Writer with Work Still to Do,"Jeremy Davenant's Uncle Gerald tears a page out of a dictionary and tells the youngster (who is really his girlfriend's son) that here is his destiny. It's a leaf from the S's, which includes Shakespeare, the Hindu play ""Shakuntala"", and the Ukranian city of Shakhyorsk. What can such disperate fragments have to do with someone's real life? Jeremy finds out.This is a promising premise for a book, and could have, should have, made ""Prisoner in a Red-Rose Chain"" a lively, brain teasing kind of read. But instead, it's caught up in Jeremy's obsession for the weird and unappealing Milena, and gets stuck in a ""boy wins,"" ""boy loses"" groove. There are some well-written scenes and an interesting character in Uncle Gerald, but Jeffrey Moore seemed unsure whether to gamble on one of those frisky literary tales or commit to a semi-comic saga of 20-something angst. A writer to watch, but he's not there yet."
5,Good code although too many overheads,"The library provides a good collection of numerical computations, some of which are more robust and better written than the ones offered in Numerical recipies. The book only lists the formulas used and the enclosed CD supplies the software."
5,You don't have to be a jerk to make real money,"I'm giving a copy to my boss! A rejuvinating read. Tells how companies can make gobs of money while actually being nice to it's employees. Give hope to the ""nice guys finish first"" notion. The Southwest Airlines story was particularly inspiring."
4,great book,Carmen has touched my heart with her stories of hope in a hopeless situation. She has written straight from the heart an awesome book in a down-to-earth style that anyone would enjoy.
1,Another one not really.....,"I was trying to obtain Medical Information, regarding this diease.....not a family's life story; True, sad. Because this dieaseeventually will kill.....But, the previous reviews were a bit to much like a sales pitch.....INFORMATIVE, INSIGHTFUL, etc.;Overtly, smattered with prayers, and not much content. Anyone who may have a diagnosis, of HUNTINGTON'S. May want to find a resource center,or speak with their Nuerologist. Pass:<"
5,Go Buy It!,"This Pittsburgh band is one of a few that is absolutely original, and still unknown (which I can't figure out). Folksy, whimsical, poetic, and yet catchy in their rhythms makes this group a must hear. Go buy it. Hint: If you find their first CD (self-titled), but it also, it's better yet."
5,Awesome stuff...,"Lost in America is a CD that proves that there are great bands out there making great cds...that hardly anyone ever hears.Great songwriting, great music, powerful vocals, awesome lyrics (as opposed to just ""words""). If you like Counting Crows, Wallflowers, Paul Westerberg, the Devlins...give these guys a listen"
1,"Bad software, very poor support policies","Program never works without issues. Sometimes it sends the data to quickbooks and sometimes it doesn't. Other times it sends double or triple the hours that were worked. this is a payroll nightmare. Support is $75 for 30 minutes and they don't care if you are up and running if you don't pay. They just say ok, goodbye. I would definitely get something else."
1,Not a way to learn,"This pack is a talking phrase book. You hear the phrase in English, and then twice in Spanish. There is not really time for you to repeat the phrase before we are on to the next one. There is nothing to sustain your interest, the different sections are quite long, and the phrases are quite complicated. There is no intereaction between the product and you. As a learning tool for a beginner, this product is virtually useless. A plus point is that you hear native speakers of the language. The product certainly does not live up to the blurb on the cover. Had I known what it was like, I would not have bought it - i would advise you not to waste your money on it."
2,Not worth buying,"I borrowed this from the library. There is not much to it -- just vocabulary words and phrases, and there often isn't enough time to repeat the phrases. There are two Hispanic speakers, and the male often does not pronounce the ""s"" in words (which is common in a few countries). It's rather irritating, since a person not familiar with the words would have to be looking at the booklet in order to know when there's supposed to be an ""s"" in a word."
2,Water Based Stain,"My first try with water based stain. Will work nice on table tops or other flat surfaces, but if have inside corners work fast, this dries very quickly. I'll probably stick with oil base stains, but someone else might have a few tricks to make this stain work better than I can."
5,The Ultimate Silos,"Perhaps the most wonderful chant CD ever! If you are a fan of Gregorian Chant and/or the monks of Santo Domingo de Silos, this CD is sure to please. Having listened to most of their albums, I have to say that this is probably the best."
5,"Considering its size, it is very good","I was very surprised at the quality of the photo's, text, and scope of this small book. It is nicely published, and is surprisingly comprehensive. Highly recommended."
4,"Practical, easy read...","I picked up this book before boarding a flight from Manila to Amsterdam. When I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down. It was so fascinating that I was done with it just a fourth of the way to Amsterdam!Jeffrey J. Fox wrote a very interesting, easy read (conversational style) book. If I were to sum it up, it's all about proper behavior and disposition that an executive should take. From managing ones career, to interaction with customers and employees, dealing with office politics - this book has a lot of very good and practical advice for experienced executives and aspiring executives alike.Examples are shared through stories, sometimes humorous but so true you'll catch yourself giggling from time to time reading all 75 tips on how to become (or should I say behave) like a CEO. You'll have a lot of fun and will definitely learn a lot by reading this book."
2,You can do better,"I bought this book in a rush to have something to read on the plane. I am CEO of my company so I think I might have some insight into what it takes.While some of the points were right on (like doing work on a plane or not having a drink with the gang), some of the points were silly and wouldn't project well on a would-be CEO. For example, take any job that is handed down by the boss. Well maybe, but Fox says to take ANY job even of it's watering the plants. Perhaps a better rule should be to find someone to water the plants, not to actually water them yourself as Mr. Fox suggests.All in all the book was too short and too expensive."
4,Quick and Easy,"YOu'ld find at least 3 or 4 things that you'll want to incorporate into your life immediately. For that alone, its worth the price."
4,Worth reading,"This is a book that makes some excellent points. However it sometimes confuses the practical with the cynical. Real worlds nuts and bolts advice doesn't have to be cynical or cold blooded. After you read, How to Become CEO, I would recommend my favorite real world business book, Filling the Glass: The Skeptic's Guide to Positive Thinking in Business. It's a model for a book that can be incredibly practical and real-world effective, never giving in to Polyanna gee-whiz wishful thinking, yet it's uplifting and even inspiring at the same time. It's skeptical without being cynical, because, guess what, the real world is not alway as crass as How to Become CEO sometimes makes it seem."
3,How to bang an empty drum...,"We all know the feeling - envying the polished person who says and do the right things all the time. JJ Fox has made a list of 72 items with a short description that can make you into a such polished person - but trust me, it will not be enough to become a CEO unless you can also deliver professionally. If you feel a need to profile yourself, and your current work-product does not allow for it, you should certainly buy this book.If you are smart enough to already contribute to the success of your company but of course wouldn't mind a few tips, then you would probably already have browsed the table of contents above left getting the tips free of charge....."
4,"Quick read, really worth while","This little book has great tid bits of info, everyone should pick it up"
1,Do not purchase,I was very disappointed in this product. I purchased the CD version. I would not recommend it to others because some of the suggestions are ludicris. I wish I could get a full refund.
2,"Vague, vague, vague",I always got docked in college composition classes for not elaborating. Mr. Fox did not explain anything for more than two pages. It also reminds me of when the teacher would ask for a 5 page paper and I would put big margins and big font size so I could turn in a 3 page paper that looked to be five. He has a writing ability comparable to a high school senior.
1,Lacks content & won't really help you become a CEO!,"This is an easy to read book, almost in point form. However it lacks content and depth. It's not really saying much about leadership which is one of the most important aspect of being a CEO. It talks about general things, most of which will be helpful in your career but not specifically to be a CEO."
4,Commonsense Advice For Any Cubicle Dweller,"I read this book while sat in the Stanford University bookshop. It's easy to digest and provides lots of sensible advice. This book isn't just for budding CEOs. It provides advice that applies to anyone who wants to succeed in any organization. By the way, having read the book I decided to buy it before I left the store. I'm reading it again now."
2,"I agree with, for US business culture only!","This book has no application to the world econmony or job market. As the prior reviewer mentione the topics on social behavior are at best puritanical. If you do not have a drink with co workers, or go to parties in Europe it is a very BIG insult and would be a great detriment to your career progression. There is some decent generic advice however but not enough."
3,"Simple and Easy to Read but Not enough ""Depth""","Its a good book, it is simple and easy to read(almost point form). It gives you a general idea on how to plan your career but it doesn't have enough ""depth"", For the price, for the ""hard cover"", I expect more ""details"" from this book."
5,Concise Book With Excellent Advice,"How to Become CEO: The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization, by Jeffrey J. Fox, is an excellent reference for acheiving in the corporate environment. Mr. Fox provides 75 pointers in an easy-to-read format that, if implemented, will undoubtedly make a difference in anyone's career. These include tips like ""don't expect the personnel department to plan your career"" and ""never surprise your boss"". None of these are particularly surprising, but all are important, and this book provides handy reminders."
4,"Quick, easy reading tips on how to get to the top!!","I found this book to be very good! It is quick and easy to read. I finished it on one plane trip. It is motivating and presents its ideas in 75 tips. I passed it along as a ""must read"" to peers in an executive roundtable group. Although all 75 tips are great, I had my own top six favorites including: 1. Do not get discouraged by the idea killers. 2. Never panic or lose your temper. 3. Always take a vacation. 4. Do something hard and lonely. 5. Think for 1 hour a day. 6. Arrive 45 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late. The author's validity in compiling this list added to my satisfaction of the book."
5,A Career Investment,"Excellent book. Short and simple advice that is essential for anyone in any business. From Finance to the Arts, this book will help you become a dominant figure in any industry. A must read for anyone who wants to succeed!!"
2,Not worth the money,"There were some interesting tips in the book, but nothing you haven't heard before. Advice on how to disable a rival with one statement was lame. Save your money."
3,"Good for you, bad for the company","This book is just a hash-up of ""what-not-to-do""s. You may increase your chances of promotion but spare a thought for the company!Ethics and managerial behaviour which is based on strong values will produce a better CEO than one who merely reads this book or thinks that this book holds the key. Whatever happened to real managerial expertise, proper corporate governance, strategic planning/implementation and new business models? In my opinion, this book describes and values political behaviour which actually causes the problems that companies face. I am afraid this book is out-of-date in a world that is changing so fast.An example: the author advises you to say yes to your supervisor's every request, even if he asks you to water the plants! Shows what type of thinking the author is using.Read it only if you want to know what goes on in the heads of the people who destroy a company. Read the book if you want to get ahead but don't let anyone see you reading it."
3,Some Good Trivial Advice in a Skinny Book,"To become a CEO, I think you'll need more than what is in this book. There are some interesting tidbits here and there, but a CEO will not emerge once this book is read.Has Mr. Fox ever traveled on business? Some of his advice (don't have a drink with coworkers, work instead in your hotel room, order room service, etc.) could be a slap in the face to the salespeople/customers/coworkers who are hosting your trip.After reading this book, it would seem anyone could make up a few lists and publish a book about anything, and not really have to be a writer. There are some interesting parts of this small book, and I would still recommend reading it and reading it periodically again and again to get the most out of it, but wait for the paperback version."
3,hoped for better,"The sub-title is ""The story of the German Soldier."" The sub-title really should have been ""The story of the history of the German Army, lite."" There are plenty of titles about that already. I had hoped for the perspective and role of the alleged sub-title: the individual private or sergeant in the barracks or on the parade-ground within the context of a large organization. The book instead focuses on the generals, princes, and Kaisers -- which more than enough has been written."
5,Very informative. Packed with detail.,"This talks about the making of the trollies - Tulsa, Sand Springs, Oklahoma City and some other towns. How they were run and why they went out of business. It is designed to give information, not intended to entertain."
5,"This is a classic, must have CD","I first bought this album twenty years ago and probably played it at least a hundred times. I just saw the CD version on Amazon and am buying it today. If you love the old standards, this CD will not disappoint. The Very Thought of You, Teach Me Tonight, and I'm Beginning to See the Light are truly wonderful. And Diane's version of New York State of Mind is my favorite rendition of this great Billy Joel classic. The orchestration and arrangements are also top notch."

5,It does exactly what you need it to do for your vintage Pachinko machine.,I was looking for a way to attach a 9-volt to the vintage Pachinko machine I bought for my husband for Christmas. This was perfect and it turned out that another on e of the reviewers used it for the same thing. It works just like you would think it should. Easy peasy.
1,The white is not better,"Refined shea butter (white) is processed using chemicals, thus stripping the shea butter of its many healing properties. When chemically processed, it goes through a refining, bleaching, deodorization and degumming process, which destroys the shea butter. It leaves it stripped of its vitamins, minerals and many other natural healing properties.The yellow is the only way to go to get all the benefits."
1,I am not happy,"with this product, because it came in the plastic bag, I was expecting it will come in some bottle, I lost a lot of it when I put it in the jar and is hard so it is hard to spread over body I am not happy at all."
3,just fair,I was not very impressed with this product. My skin is not any softer and doesn't look any healthier after a month of use.
4,Smells SO much better than the yellow,"This seller is committed to customer satisfaction. For some reason, I assumed that once I purchased the yellow product, I'd keep it whether I liked it or not. However, the seller was told about my dissatisfaction with the smell of the yellow and offered - at his expense - to replace my shipment with the white butter. I received it today, and like it so much better than the yellow. So, please know that he aims to please."
3,Unless you REALLY can't put up with the smell...,"I'm surprised the seller doesn't mention that when gold shea butter is turned into white shea butter it loses a lot of its healing properties. Yes the gold stuff smells, but it's a lot better to use."
4,White Shea Butter,"First of all, the seller is committed to great customer service. In regards to the product, I have tried both gold and white. I find the white a bit more oily than the gold. I agree, the white is odorless. My skin tends to get extremely dry (feet, legs) so my experience is that it takes a larger quantity of the white to moisturize, than it does for the gold. My family loves the white-their first choice. However, mine is still the gold. It makes your skin feel smooth like silk. And, a little goes a long way. Most other creams and lotions wear off in an hour or two and my skin is dry again. But, the gold african shea butter lasts for many hours. In the extremely hot temperatures, I put sunscreen on over it. It is also very creamy to apply, if it does not get cold."
5,Original Sony quality,"I have to admit the case is crap and I chucked it, got a better softer one. The price was so good on this kit that it was worth it just for the battery!It is important to have a good backup battery ready to go, save my butt a few times."
1,NOT for iPad or Safari.,"I Love this book and was looking for an audio version. This is NOT for the iPad! They tell you AFTER you buy it that you have to download another app in order to listen to the book. If you're ok with that, fine. But I would have liked to know that before-hand."
5,This book changed they way I thought of myself.,"Shad takes you through a series of mental exercises to begin new thought processes. These processes allow you to change your self-esteem, sleeping habits, punctuality, weight, whatever you feel needs improvement in your life. It really works."
5,Easy to apply,"It's been a few months since I got the book. Currently I am using the scripts that are included in the book.This review is to testify, that ones you do it with intent, focus and passion, the rewards are very obvious.There are scripts covering virtually every area of your life. I give this book my highest recommendations as it helps me manage myself and to direct my thoughts.You will have to take the time and to be passionate about it, but once you do, the pay-offs are enormous."
5,A must-have,"This album is fantastic. Having listened to goth music for a very long time and generally being disappointed with a lot of the newer music that is coming out, I have to say that I have never heard anything like this before. I can listen to this album over and over again and not tire of it...in fact I do have other Attrition albums but this one always seems to be the one that I select. It is truly a masterpiece and a great addition to any experimental/dark/oddball collection."
5,Deserves 10 stars!,"Oh, I see my family using this a LOT!! It really makes a tasty dog. Just like the ball park! Anyone who likes hot dogs should have one."
1,Poor Construction,"Waring Pro HDG100 400-Watt Hot-Dog GrillerI wish it would have worked, the reviews seemed so good. I recieved my first one damaged. The red indicator lens was broken and the control switch would not go to the low speed/temp position. Returned item and recieved a second griller. It also had a broken indicator light lens and the switch would not go to the Hi speed/temp position. So, I returned it and did not get a replacement. Never even got a cooked hot dog out of the deal."
1,"It burns, curls and leaves a burned ring mark on hot dog","I wanted a machine where I can leave the cooked hot dog for extended time in the roller for low temp setting and this was n't achieved using this machine as I intended. The heating mechanism is very high even in low temp- it gives option for low and high temperature but even in low its burns the hotdog. If you don't pay attention to it it will curl the hot dogs. Also its lives burned ring mark on hot dogs, so therefore the heating is not also uniform in the roller."
1,Broken fresh from the box,"I don't know if the cooker worked or not. I returned it the day I received it. Just like other posts here, the light on the front of the unit was broken. It is not an amazon problem it is a factory package problem. This problem appears to have been around for a while. Don't bother buying, you'll just have to return it."
1,BROKEN ITEM,"I should have listened to the guy who receive the Waring Pro with the broken switch and indicator light. Mine, too, came damaged and I am returning it for a refund. I will take my chances at a local appliance store instead. Very disappointed, as I ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my husband."
5,So simple So perfect,"Just start the thing turning, put the dogs on, go watch TV and wait for the smell of the dogs ang go get them. Perfection."
5,Lives up to its frill.,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing a hot dog griller. I'm glad I did, this is a great product and it lives up to its word. Its easy to use and easy to clean.6 perfectly grilled hotdogs in just 8 minutes! I love it.promero"
4,okay,I like the hot dog griller the only thing I would like is a way to heat the buns. But otherwise it's very nice.
2,Hot Dog Cold Dog,I was really excited to get my hot dog cooker only to find out when I plugged it in that it didn't work properly. Only half of the rollers heated up leaving me with cold dogs instead of hot dogs. The ones that did cook were a tasty treat. I read the other reviews on here and took my chances hoping I would get a machine that worked. Instead of getting another machine I took the broken one to one of the repair centers in the warranty guide. I didn't want to have the same experience of receiving another defective machine like some of the other reviewers. Good Luck to you if you order one. I hope you get one that works.
3,"My fault for not thoroughly reading the description, but...","it cooks only 6 hot dogs at a time. My husband wanted a hot dog cooker and I ordered this one. It works OK, cleanup isn't bad, but it sure would have been nice if you could cook a whole package of (Ball Park) hot dogs at one time. If that's not an issue for you, then you'll be satisfied with it."
1,I cannot recommend this book.,"I too am a Reiki Master, and cannot recommend this book to my students. This book dedicates almost one third of it's length to a section about supposed metaphysical meanings of the symptoms of various illnesses. This section makes statements such as, ""male sterility indicates fear of close relationship"", and ""When a miscarriage occurs, it is probable that the child is being consciously or unconsciously rejected."" - statements I believe to be insulting, and untrue. Regardless of my opinion of the accuracy of these statements, at the very least, they have nothing whatsoever to do with Reiki, and it is irresponsible to present them as such."
2,BORING! Outragous claims of what Reiki can do!,"This book has one main point to make and makes that point ad nauseum! Basically, this book seems to say that there is absolutely nothing that can't be completely healed by Reiki, including cancer and problems with animals!The writer's state that the effects of Down's Syndrome, which they call Mongoloidsm, can be healed with Reiki! The mere fact that they refer to Down's Syndrome as Mongoloidism is offenseive. This book was written in 1985 and by then that term wasn't used anymore.Then there's the constant use of he, him, his, and mankind to refer to all humans male and female.There is some valuable information in this book, but not a lot. They state that Reiki cannot be taught by reading a book. So I wonder why they wrote it. This is the first book I've read on the subject and I'll probably buy more books and videos since I'm interested in the subject."
3,exposes hidden & maligned archeology that is contraversal,i thoroughly enjoyed vol. 1 most of vol.2 and wish they left out vol.3 untill they had more conclusive evidence. i applaud NBC for showing vol.1. i don't normally applaud NBC but in this case i have to. to their credit they aired an anti-establishment show that stands toe to toe with conventional evolutionary theory and serves it a 10 count knock out. fascinating evidence of humans being alive millions of years ago even walking with dinosaurs. evidence of mans handy work dating back anywhere from 250k years to 2 billions. heavens forbid could the bible be right after all. it also depicts what happens when you buck the establishment. guarenteed to raise your blood pressure and make you want to throttle your local professor of archeology. summary- worth seeing and having they should have discarded vol.3 until more research was done to confirm or disprove the evidence. jb
1,"""Dr."" Carl Baugh is a sharlatan and a liar","Anyone with any scientific education will immediately see thought this Garbage. Anyone who believes said Garbage has no capacity for critical thinking and will probably believe any thing T.V. tells them as long as it includes some variation on ""just as the bible says."" A quick search of ""Dr."" Carl Baugh will reveal that his credentials are all completely bogus; he was awarded a doctorate from the unaccredited school of which he is the president. And his discoveries have a habit of changing locations. Give me a break. Even creationists have denounced this fraud. I know this review may not change the minds of those hell-bent on accepting creationism or it's twin in the cheap rented tux, intelligent design. But if it can persuade one person to do their own research and think openly and critically, then it's worth it. Ask Questions."
4,"Among books, the best 20 minute read I've had","This snappy, deceptive book grows on you when you piece together the real point of the 10 or so micro chapters (some are only a few paragraphs long)- human experience is by nature a series of surprises and the good writer revels in them. Fans of the film Smoke, script by the same author, will see how Auster's theory works: the story's structure consists of surprising turns of events as they thread through and are integrated by the imagination of the viewer."
2,"Fine, but not what I wanted","These t-pins are a great price, but not what I was looking for. They're very thick, and somewhat dull on the tip. I'm sure they work great for bulletin boards or office cubicle walls, but for fine-point pining (which is what I need) they're too big."
5,Trait Secrets: Winning Together When You DON'T Think Alike,"I enjoyed reading this book, or should I say, ""I enjoyed experiencing this book"". I am surprised how quickly I was pulled into this nifty and practical tool. I loved the quick tests of self evaluation and they showed me what was happening around me with my work peers. I've been struggling for a year not knowing how to get through a tough situation at work, and then bang - this little book showed me what has been happening, and gave me several options on how to get through it successfully without quiting. What a relief, finally some assistance. It makes so much common sense when I think about it now! I passed the book onto a colleague, I hope it will help him! He needs it! :-)"
5,Inspiration!,I first discovered the SARK books when I was a junior in high school. Ever since then I have been in love with them! They are great inspirational self-help books. The pages are in full color and completely uplifting. This book is no exception.
3,SARK cracks me up.,"Sometimes SARK's completely over the top giddyness and ""you-can-do-it"" attitude are almost humorous in their delivery. But that was exactly what I needed at the time in my life when I came across this book. It is filled with motivating mantras and mesmerizing manipulations. I was awed by her enthusiasm and by her desire to fill others with that same enthusiasm. I can't say I always like it. Sometimes I'm just like ""SHUT UP"" but it's almost like a good friend who gives you that boost when you need it and leaves you alone when you want her to."
2,Scribbles and platitudes,"There really isn't much to say about this book. It's cute and makes for nice eye candy. But it has more platitudes than suggestions and I wouldn't recommend it as a stand-alone. If you want a book that delves into creativity, check out Julia Cameron before she went completely commercial. This book might be a supplement to The Artist's Way, but otherwise it doesn't prove much except that you make gobs of money as a self-help guru without having to do much but scribble and spout trite phrases."
3,Hoover SpinSweep,I purchased to Hoover spin sweeper to help clean my driveway. I does a fare job and does make sweeping the driveway easier.
3,Cuts clean up time in half.,This item works ok. I guess I had a lot of expectations because I had seen the informercial. It doesnt work well on wet grass or even damp grass for that matter. The kids enjoy using it and dont mind helping with outside duties because of it. I dont know why it costs $80 bucks the craftsmanship doesn't reflect the cost (based on the look of it) but I guess only time will tell.I have to admit tho it does do the job and it definately cuts the clean up time in half.
5,Wow - who would have guessed,"I purchased this with very little expectation. While it doesn't look like much in the picture, you will not believe how amazingly well this product works. It is definitely my new favorite toy! We have tons of Mesquite trees in our yard and they are in the season where they drop peapods by the millions. One pass over the driveway and the difference was unbelievable. I love this product!"
3,"Not bad, but not great","It's great for driveways, and while a previous reviewer mentioned trouble with pine needles, I have found that it will sweep up very small twigs and leaf stems. We have a black walnut tree that sheds stems like crazy and this is not bad for sweeping them up as well as the annoying walnuts that fall onto the driveway. I think that if you learn to set it on the ""low"" setting, it can sweep off the driveway nicely. The other trick is to push downward slightly as you are simultaneously pushing it forward. The downward pressure will ensure a smooth connection with the driveway. However, my kids are not yet dexterous enough to be able to exert the proper pressure required, but the push motion is enough to get them to participate in the sweeping chores."
4,Pretty Good,"Exactly what I was looking for. Picks up all sorts of debris from my trees that land on the deck and get tracked into the house. Usually needs 2 or 3 passes to pick up most everything, but works far better than the broom ever did."
2,Not for gravel,I was excited by other reviews and was looking forward to getting my L1400 to keep on top of the gravel in our garage and in my shop building that comes in on vehicle tires. I am very disappointed. It might do a good job on leafs but it sure doesn't leave a garage floor clean when there is even a small amount of gravel on it. If you have gravel roads or driveway I would search for something else to keep your floors clean or fall back on the dusty broom!
5,This is wicked,"The so solid crew are wicked, they are the second best in the UK after the Genius crew, without a doubt."
1,Beachyboy is a muppet and SO WAT ?!!!?!,well after listing to this album many times i have discoverd that i normally fall asleep after 21 seconds !! well i am a little dia pointed but then hey /... its GARAGE
5,I LOVE THIS CD,"IF YOU HAVE NOT GOTTEN THIS CD YOU NEED TO IMMEDIATELY. THIS YOUNG LADY IS SO TALENTED AND SHE HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY VOICE. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COPY, YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON THE NEXT BEST THING...YOU GO GIRL!!!"
2,PSI SPECIFIC,"These jaws seem to work with PSI chucks only. I tried to fit them to two chucks that I have and they did not work. Unless you have a PSI chuck, do not order this item."
3,Not what I expected....,"There was some interesting information about early Exeter, NH in this book. My criticism is the format in which it was reprinted. This book is the size of a picture book for children and that's what I thought it was when I first opened the package. Why such a large (9"" by 11 1/2"") format? The original could have easily been reprinted in a smaller format. To those who might consider this book, it is only 39 pages long and there is no table of contents,nor is there an index of any sort."
3,HOOVER S2200,IT DOES A GREAT JOB. GETS IN HARD TO REACH PLACES. COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT IT PICKED UP. GREAT SUCTION. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL ON BARE FLOORS.
1,Poor Design....Beware,"I have had this product for 2 weeks and I will be sending it back unless Hoover fixes a major problem.The nozzle head continously falls off as you rotate it during use.I have contacted Hoover and they are supposed to send me a new head.If that does not solve the problem,it goes back.I am happy with all other performance issues and I will keep it and recommend it if the nozzle head issue is fixed."
2,Keep Shopping for a Better Alernative!,"I am very disappointed in the suction power of the Hoover S2200 Flair. It is good on bare floors but terrible on carpeting (and my carpeting is a very low pile). The dirt cup is a pain to clean out ... all the dirt sticks to the filter. Cleaning the filter is a messy, disgusting job that has to be done after each use or you will really lose suction. I purchased this to replace my old Hoover stick vac and there is no comparison. Keep shopping for a better alternative."
4,Hoover Bagless Stick Cleaner,Was pleased with the timeleness of the shipment and the cost of the cleaner. Was not the cleaner I was looking for but I am beginning to suspect they don't make them anymore as I could not find it on line or in the stores. Such is progress.
2,I would not rate it as No. 1,"I chose this product as a result of being highly rated by the Consumer Reports October 08 issue. The dust accumulates at the top of the bag, not great at edge cleaning. Hope my personal vac has a manufacturer's defect and not that all of them are like it! I would not recommend it."
1,did not last long,this machine did not hold up well. it fell apart with minimal use had to buy another machine not the same one to replace it.
2,"Throwing out my old broom, then this one, too","This Hoover vacuum is lightweight and easy to maneuver and did a good job of picking up crumbs and cat fur. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the suction to pick up much else. Cat litter? Forget it. I have to clean the filter out several times whenever I use it because of the pet hair from two cats. I like that it lays almost flat to reach under furniture, but if it leave larger particles, grass, food, etc behind, it doesn't matter that it can reach. Because of the way the head attaches to the body, it won't stand up on its own, making storage problematic. I really liked this at first, compared to my old broom, but became frustrated with the lack of suction and moved up to a more powerful vacuum."
3,Can't Complain for the Price,"I got this item at 40% off with free shipping, so I can't complain. As with most things these days, it's all plastic, so I plan to be very careful with it because it seems as though it would break easily."
1,rich parziale,"I never purchased such a cheaply made item from hoover,had it 2 weeks and the nozzle cracked and broke off,crap,crap,crap,money just waisted.Hoover Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum, Bagless, S2200"
4,Great product,This is a great vacuum for quick clean-ups on bare and carpeted floors. Would recommend to those with small children.
3,disapointed,I bought it because Consumer Report recommended it for picking up animal hair. Not nearly as good as I expected.
1,Hoover Bagless Stick Vacuum,I'm not sure what is wrong but the part of the vac that is on the floor is very loose and i cannot control it. So I don't use it.
2,Not really worth the savings,"We moved to a new home and since we have hardwood floors and area rugs now rather than wall to wall we decided to get rid of our huge vacuum and try a smaller one.This vacuum seemed like it would be an appropriate size for 1 large and 2 small area rugs plus one carpeted porch. I am disappointed in it's inability to pull dirt out of the rug and in how long it takes to vacuum now. The vacuum is awkward and doesn't stand up on it's own, which can be over looked if it would effectively clean. The area on the head of the vacuum that sucks up dirt is so small that you have to go over and over with just that 2 in segment to get anything off the carpet. It is also fairly loud for being a stick vacuum. I would not recommend this and after 6 months of use I am replacing it."
1,wonderful vaccumn but defective neck of the housing. Mine cracked and broke after a few uses. Is this warranted by the seller?,Is this vaccumn warranted by the seller? Mine broke after a few uses. The neck of the brush housing cracked and broke. Hopefully it can be replaced. It is a Hoover stick vaccumn with an electrical cord.
2,Bad,"The bottom part keep twisting and coming off all the time. Can't use straight for five minutes.Bad product. Again, another waste of money."
4,LOVE IT...LOVE IT...LOVE IT,"After searching several weeks for a stick vaccum, I finally decided to get this model and boy am I happy that I did! I have hard wood/tile through my entire home and have two cats and three small dogs that shed like there is no tomorrow. This little vaccum will pick up every piece of pet hair in it's way! No more sweeping for this girl!!! I gave it 4 stars only because I wish the power cord was longer, other than that, this is one great little vaccum!"
1,Stick Vacuum from Hoover stuck this customer,"I received my Hoover Flair loved it for about two weeks, until the plastic on the part in contact with the floor broke so the suction disapeared. Mind you I'm near seventy a gentle vacuumer, and looked this product up in Consumer Reports before I bought it, but in this instance, I believe CR is wrong, I'm out the purchase price, and Hoover is off my list of brands to buy or recommend."
5,awesome!,"I had the Eureka Superbroom for years... and thought it was the best. Then it broke beyond repair. I have two little kids, not to mention two cats, and the hard floors needed to be vacuumed at LEAST once a day. I tried the Shark cordless and was very disappointed. I barely got the floors vacuumed before it started to die. And I could have PICKED the dirt off the carpet easier than it did. I looked at a lot of vacuums and reviews and decided this one fit my requirements.AND BOY DOES IT!!!!!! Its great! It picks up SO much. I love the switch to go between bare floor/carpet. (Even the Eureka never did a good enough job.) The swivel head is awesome!The only thing I don't like is emptying the cup. The cat hair sticks to the filter... but I figure that is what you deal with when you want bagless. Wish it had a brush to brush off the filter - that stored inside somewhere."
4,Hoover S2200 Flair Works Well,Got the S2200 Flair Bagless Stick Vac for Christmas. Have been using it for a month and am very satisfied. Have a small apartment with wood floors but I do have a cat. It really does a good job of picking up dirt and cat hair and it does pick up kitty litter! Emptying the removable cup and filter can be messy. It also does not stand upright on its own but overall I am happy with it.
1,Flair flares up,"We bought the ""Flair"" to help with pet hair pickup. Unpacked it, assembled it, and began to vacuum. Within three minutes, we heard a loud bang and saw a shower of sparks. A spark or fireball had blown through the plastic grid (making a hole about a half-inch in diameter) separating motor from pickup chamber, and had also penetrated the filter cup. We have returned this little gem. Guess the name ""Hoover"" doesn't mean much nowadays."
5,Older reviews are not accurate now.,"Hoover S2200 Flair Bagless Stick Cleaner. This stick vacuum cleaner was given a great review by Consumer Reports,(2009). In reading the reviews here I was skeptical but wanted a new stick cleaner so I bought it. The problems of short cord and not standing upright against wall have been taken care of and I can say for dog hair it is so far the best vac cleaner I have had. It is light weight and easy to empty and does a good job picking up. Some people who have had trouble with these light weight vacs, as far as not working, might do well to understand that they have to be emptied much more often than those with bags, especially when there is dog hair involved."
3,good but cheaply make,The first impressions of the vacuum was very good but the brushing mechanism is cheaply made and did not last long. If you only use it for floors that are NOT carpeted you will be satisfied.
4,Hoover S2200 Flair Bagless Stick Cleaner,"This little Vac is a Gem.My wife loves it.When I first saw this advertised,I thought it would be just another one of those over-rated vacs.Boy,was I surprised!It works great on dog hairs, which is the main reason that I purchased it.It's light weight and stores easily away.Very maneuverable when going around furniture.We use it all the time on the hardwood floors.Thanks Hoover, for this great product."
4,Small and powerful,"I have been extremely impressed, especially for the price. The only negative is that the ""button"" that holds the cup in place came out once. We were able to get it back in, but it wasn't easy."
5,JUST what I needed!,"Just a while ago, I Received my Hoover Flair Bagless Stick vacuum, put it together, have used it and I am very PLEASED. I live in a small apartment, and this vacuum @ 7.2+ amps is very powerful and picked up extremely well, as the rug here is of medium thickness in texture. This vacuum was also EASY to put together--took me all of 3 minutes. I DIDN'T need the instructions. The other good thing about this stick vacuum is that it's not heavy and has a long power cord. ALSO the cup is a plus, as it cuts down on having to use vacuum cleaner bags, which I detest.Thanks Hoover, you've done it again!"
5,Hoover Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum,"I had one of these, and it was great, especially for dog hair. It finally wore out and I had to get another one. Great product."
3,Acceptable,"The performance is acceptable in low-pile carpet or tile/hardwood floors. It is difficult to find filter replacements, and it needs to be hung from a hook or it will fall over. The plastic piece that the cord wraps around is cracked on our unit because it was leaned against a wall and fell. It does not stand upright, so it *must* be leaned against a wall or hung on a hook.The canister is easy to empty, and the vacuum is light-weight."
4,Just What I Needed,What an easy way to purchase appliances. Love my stick vacuum and glad that I spent the time reviewing the types available. It sure beats sweeping my kitchen floor and my husband can easily use it and get the floor clean. Would never want to bother with a cordless and charging batteries. I expect this to last a long time.
2,loved it but lasted only 18 months,I have cats and dogs and kids and this was a great little stick vac and I've owned many different stick vacs (and vacuums) over the years. I only use them on my hard floors and use a regular large vacuum on the rugs. This stick vac picked up nicely and worked well in corners. Today when I used it I noticed it wasn't picking up and found a piece of plastic had cracked and broken off at the back of the canister thereby breaking its ability to suction. I only owned it for 18 months.
2,Potential of being very good if engineered better,"This item could have been an excellent solution for touch up cleaning if not for the fact that the swivel head keeps dropping of the extended pipe. The connection is not positive and although you think it is locked in place,the head assembly will drop off. I plan to bring it in for a repair and will refuse to pay any charges. The unit is is well maintained and used very infrequently and not abused."
2,Weaker than my hand-vac,"I got this vacuum to have a light, upright vacuum and it came on recommendation to me from a friend's mother. However, all it seems to be able to do is push around the dust on my hardwood floors, even with the filter completely empty. The thing is so ridiculously underpowered, I usually wind up using my hand-vac to take care of jobs the upright should be doing.It's possible I got a lemon, but as it stands, I wouldn't recommend this vacuum to anyone."
3,Decent for the $40 but not great performance wise,"We bought this mainly because my main vacuum does not have the flexibility to fit under low height furniture such as beds, couches, and dressers. So that being said, this vacuum works great for that as it almost lays flat. The suction is only so so and I dump out and clean the filter after every use. The handle does not stand up and it was made to hang on a wall, which does not work for the storage configuration in my upstairs closets. The suction hole is also fairly small and because of its weak suction, renders much of the length of the vacuum head useless.I had originally wanted to buy a cordless one but after reading reviews of how cordless vacuums generally have weaker suction thought this one, being corded, would have stronger suction power. It also works better on hardwood floors than even low carpet pile. So it is fine for the price of $40 but disappointing in its suction power."
3,Be careful on S2200 model,"There are two Hoover Flairs with the same S2200 model number, but with one significant difference. The easiest way to tell them apart is the color...this one is gray and the other is red/maroon. The gray is for hard surfaces and does not have a rotating brush in the head, so it is not good for carpet or rugs. The red has the brush for carpet and is only about $10 more.My wife rates the red model as five star when used for quick pick ups and getting into tight places.I returned the gray model and bought the red one. Amazon handeled the return and new shipment in an excellent manner."
1,You get what you pay for,"I had this vacuum for 2 years until it died. I'm actually surprised it made it that long. I can't say that it was great. It didn't pick up everything on the carpets or floors. And when I would pick it up to move it into the next room, it liked to drop half the dirt is just sucked up. The filter was a pain to clean. Not recommended."
1,"Bare Floors Maybe, Carpet Not So Much",I bought this cleaner for use in between major vacuuming. It clogs very quickly without having swept up very much. It is probably fine for floors without carpet.
3,You get what you pay for.,"I didnt spend much on this vacuum and was hoping for more honestly. The other reviews said it picks up really well like a regular vacuum but i dont believe it. Its good for cleaning up crumbs on carpet as long as they havent been stepped on etc. Its great for any hardwood floors but just doesnt have enough power to vacuum things off the carpet too efficiently, at least for me. I would just go with a regular vacuum if youre looking to pick up animal hair from carpet. Hope this helps!"
2,I don't recommend,"I was pretty excited about getting this vacuum as it seemed to be a good value. After owning it for less than 1 year (around 6 months), it is falling apart. I overlooked the fact that the vacuum can't stand at a 90 degree angle. It just wasn't that big of a deal for me. However, after sitting in the closet at an angle for the past few months, the head of the vacuum no longer stays on. It falls off every time we use the thing, so it's now basically useless.Also, we noticed a loss in suction a few months ago (well before we had issues with the head falling off).Overall, not a very well-designed product. I'd recommend finding something else."
1,"Hoover Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum, Bagless, S2200","Hoover Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum, Bagless, S2200 ----ProsThe suction is strong.The dirt cup is easy to empty.Light weight.ConsDoesn't stand upright at all.Must lean against something when not in use.Nozzel comes apart from unit, (falls off)Nozzel is difficult to rotate.All in all a frustrating product."
4,Thank goodness,I have hardwood floors in two levels of my townhome. I have a cat who tracks cat litter eveywhere. This product which I just got yesterday is great. I had a Eureka stick and the wheels started leaving marks on my floors. Then again it was three years old. Also FYI if you have harwood floors use the Bona product line to clean them. Great product I have used it for three years.
5,Great little vac,"This is the second Flair purchased from Amazon. The first lasted three years (it still runs but the wheels fell off!).It had a tendency to go through belts if you jammed the power brush with things like rug fringe and cords etc. If you hearit squeal turn it off quickly and remove the jam!We ordered spare belts from Hoover online.It is our primary vacuum. We live on the beach year round and the little vac gets quite a workout all summer. We use it dailyfor sand etc. There are minor issues ie the belt and the filter could be more robust, but for $40 you can't go wrong.Note: we have area rugs on hardwood. The power brush must be run most of the time or it will pack up with dust and dirt.In three years the motor filters never needed cleaning or changing. We did purchase a spare main filter, again from Hoover online."
4,Hoover Stick Cleaner,"I like this very much. It picks up cat hair from rugs, is light and easy to use. And the bagless compartment is easy to empty. Just wish it didn't have a cord."
4,Great quick vacuum,"Great, easy to maneuver and light vacuum that I use to do quick crumb and hair pickups in the kitchen and throughout house on hardwood floors. I've even used on carpet and seems to pick up pretty well although I use my bigger vacuum for that more regularly. Cord length is good, at first I thought it was too short but now I think it's just right. I think if it were any longer, it would just get in the way of vacuuming. 2 drawbacks: very hot air comes out side exhaust vents, just make it hot for me and emptying the filter in the canister is messy and dust flies out. But, I do love it, very handy, better than my dustbuster which never had a strong battery. Great little guy for price."
4,Not really all that easy to store...,"This was easy to put together, and works for what I needed. We have large stone tiles in our den/kitchen area and I wanted something quicker and easier than sweeping for cat litter and such. The swiveling head takes some getting used to, but seems to make it easier to get under kitchen cabinets up to the kick board. Also, picked up whole potato chips. I have only had it for 24 hours and used it once, so these are just my first impressions.BUYER BEWARE: You have to hang this thing up for storage. There's really no other way to stow it in a closet. The head does not sit flat on the floor when you hold the body straight up, like a traditional vaccum. It is at about a 45 degree angle to the body. The head does, however, flop to hang straight down when you put the vaccum on a wall hook."
4,Great vacuum with minor complaints,"I purchased this vacuum because I was tired of being pregnant and lugging my heavy Hoover upright around the house. The Flair does a great job on bare floors and a reasonable job on rugs (I don't have wall-to-wall carpet, so that is fine with me). It also does a great job picking up dog hair. Because it's so easy to maneuver, I vacuum almost daily, and it's amazing how much dirt it picks up. It's also much quieter than my regular vacuum. A few complaints: this model doesn't stand up by itself, so you have to lean it against something sturdy or leave it flat on the floor when it's not in use. I would upgrade to the next model because this is an annoying problem. The bagless filter needs to be emptied often, about 3 times before I finish the house. Like other bagless vacs, you need to be careful emptying the filter so that you don't disperse the dust back into your house. It would be nice if Hoover made a bagged version."
1,Buyer Beware,"My Hoover Flair Stick broke the 5th time I used it, snapped right off at the neck. Apparently this appears to be a common problem, and I wish I had read these reviews more closely before purchasing.To add insult to injury, because it was past 30 days (but less than 60), Amazon will only refund a portion of the price. What a ripoff! I understand it is not their fault, but they should honor products they sell.If you still insist on purchasing one, do so at a retail outlet that will refund the full purchase price when it breaks off.Good luck."
4,works great,Does what it is supposed to do. Fairly easy to use and has a convenient set up for keeping the cord wrapped neatly.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product. I've had a Flair before. It is convenient for quick clean-up between regular vacuuming. The old Flair has a roller brush for carpet that picked up lint, etc pretty good. This one only has 2 stiff brushes that are supposed to retract for floors, and extend for carpet - by depressing a plastic lever with your foot. It is so flimsy that it broke on first use. I am keeping the Flair, it does work fine for dusty floors."
4,Loved it but.........,"The Hoover S2200 Flair Bagless Vac was easy to handle. I am crazy about the bagless feature. I am a handicap person and spent a lot of time looking for a vac I could easily use and would do a good job ...... I thought I found it! However,the head kept falling off and there was no way my husband could get it to stay on. I was very disappointed!"
2,Not good for long cat hair!,"I read that this was one of the best vacuums for people with long haired cats.It's not.I have a VERY low, almost ""outdoor's"" type carpet... and it barely picks up my cat's hair off of it.It also doesn't have very good sucking power.It swivels like a dream though! That's one good point!I guess bottom line, spend the extra money on a better vacuum. You're going to end up spending it anyway!"
3,Great for bare floors...,"works great on tile and wood flooring...carpet, not so much. Doesn't pick up any hair or lint. It more rolls the hair and lint up into little balls which I have to pick up, turn the vacuum over and put it in. I like that it isn't loud. I don't recommend this product for carpet at all."
2,Still breaking off. Drat.,"Loved this vac, as long as it lasted. Slightly under one year. Tonight, happily swiveling round a corner, the housing broke as described in many posts below. So since I bought it last winter, did I get an old one or the new improved unbreakable one?Can I really repair it with duct tape, or is that just a preventive move? Cause I don't have enough money to get something else."
2,Doesn't stand up,"This item seemed great until I had to stop to pick something up, and quickly realized that the vacuum doesn't stand up on its own. So you have to lay it down on the floor if you need to stop for a minute. Very inconvenient."
1,my worst purchase,"bought 2 on amazon. both units cut out after 3 minutes. Called hoover to complain. Ho. plastic housing for brush snapped. Straight to garbage after very light use; brushing kitchen floor. with shipping $100 straight down the tubes. JUNK. Candidates for bailout? they probably left the Chinese $10 to design, engineer, and produce. I wonder if they bothered looking after the advertising."
1,An industry standard,"This vacuum cleaner maintains a vacuum near atmospheric pressure: due to this, there is no surprise when little or no dirt is picked up. I am unimpressed. This is certainly an industry standard. A near useless piece of plastic."
2,Worked Great for THREE Days!!,"I loved it! Then, on the fourth day the nozzle would not switch from carpet to bare floor and kept falling off the end of the electric broom. Called Hoover Customer Service (and I use that term loosely)and they wanted me to drive 1 and 1/2 hours away and SEE if they would warrantee it! All I can say is thank goodness I bought it from Amazon because I returned it to them and they refunded my purchase immediately!"
4,Great for use in between cleaning days,"This handy little tool works great for picking up pet hair in a pinch. Allows for quick clean ups, and I am all for not having to get out the regular vacuum cleaner when time is limited and dog hair is not."
4,Nice 2nd sweeper,"This sweeper is nice for tile,wood floors. It also will pick up on carpet that isn't real plush. It is a consumer report #1 for this kind of a sweeper. I am not real crazy about how you clean the dirt out of it but will over look that."
2,It's Not Powerful Enough,"I bought this vacuum after reading the reviews, thinking that this would be the answer to my problems. My full-size vac broke down right after we moved to our new house, which is 80% tile floors. I was looking for a vac that would help me clean my floors before mopping, and that would also work on the 3 area rugs I'd bought. It worked great on the floors except I'd have to go over the same spot 2-4 times to pick up larger objects like Cheerios and dry cat food.The problem was when I set it to carpet mode and tried to pick up the scattered kitty litter from the cat box. I'd have to vacuum over the same spot on the carpet 5-8 times before the litter would get picked up! Totally disappointing, so I am now shopping for another vacuum."
2,quick broom,"I bought this vacuum from Amazon about a year ago because I have hardwood floors and rugs. It didn't have a rotary brush that sucked up the rugs. About six months ago the swivel head came off and ever since falls off just about every time I vacuum. Also the filter clogs up every time you vacuum. It's hard to get all the dust and dog hair off the material. I have to pick at it and bang it against the fence outside. You do have to wash it regularly. It picks up fairly good, but the swivel head is a real problem after it fell off the first time. I'm about ready to throw it away and get another brand."
1,beware!,"I had great hopes for this little, lightweight vacuum. As of today, I'm having to throw it away. The head broke off and finally can no longer be taped on, making it nonfunctional. The filter also ripped within the first month of owning it, partly because I banged the filter against a tree producing a small rip. The vacuum then sucked improperly with a $25 tag to fix it. Be gentle with bagless filters, no banging against rough surfaces! Considering how the head of this vacuum is supposed to swivel, a nice feature, it puts stress on the head joint and failed on me. I just ordered a Dirt Devil with a more substantial head to stick joint to replace this vacuum."
2,Works great until the head falls off.,"We have two of these vacs and they are fantastic until the cleaning head falls off. The first one came off and we had it replaced by Hover. Now the second unit has the same problem but it is no longer under warranty.When the head separates there is no way to fix it because the plastic that was holding it together has worn away. It is definitely a design flaw that will happen to all of them until they change the design.Now I have to find one that works as well as this one did, but won't fall apart."
3,"it is ok,","it tends to swivel from its weight being mostly in the middle. Feels off balance, but meets my needs fine,"
4,hoover flair,Like this small vacuum. Is heavier than expected nonetheless it works well for surface cleaning on carpets and does a decent job on hard floors.
3,"Well, what did I expect?","This vacuum is small, easy to use, bagless, just OK, not a real winner. Pick up is not that great."
4,Small secrets,"Harvest Moon is a game with many things to do. But it can be hard to begin. I would say it is very fun. You have to find ways to earn money and grow crops and much more. And, you can even buy animals. If you name your cow Cocoa he'll produce the best quality milk when you first get it. In Harvest Moon, there are days and seasons.You can even fish."
5,"Looks Boring, But Rocks N64!","This is a great game! My neighbor gave it to me along with N64 after he got a PS2 for Christmas. It might look boring, I mean, how much fun can farming and taking care of animals be? But the game goes much beyond that. Within two hours of playing, I was completely addicted! There are so many things to do, like getting married and going to festivals. With so many ways to complete the game, it makes playing over and over again so much fun! After three years, the game is over in the sense that you aren't really working for much, but you can keep playing, and it doesn't get any less fun. I reccomend you buy this game right away, even if the price is high because it is worth every penny that you pay."
5,#1 On My Wish List!,"What I liked about it was that it was nice to see a game that wasn't a shootm' up violent kind of game. This RPG, role-playing simulation is a peaceful kind hearted game in which you deal with the real life ordeals of being a farmer. From sick animals to finding the perfect wife and raising children Harvest Moon is a great learning experiance. Another cool thing I like is the fact that the game has no set ending time, you can play for as long as you like! For parents who are looking for a non-violent game for children (and adults) Harvest Moon 64 is an exellent choise."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,I wasted 3 good twenty dollar bills on this game. Sorry all you enthusiastic fans but it stinks
5,It's a classic!,"Harvest Moon 64, is one of the best game i owned. It's good story line and gameplayer, is one main reasons. You earn money and do alot of other stuff. Like, mine, fish, bluid stuff, find treasure, go to the dog races, bluid add ons to your house(like a deck or green house), and lots of other. So do yourself a favor and buy this game."
5,AWESOME!,"This game is so addictive! You won't want to put it down, trust me. Harvest Moon 64 enables you to play as a farmer, who interacts with people and animals. You can plant crops, raise animals, go to festivals, get married, and have a baby! This game may sound boring, but when you pick up this farm-filled game, you'll fall in love."
4,This game Rocks,"This game is so fun I play it all the time because I rent it at the videostore. You would think that raiseing a farm would be boring but its not. You weed, grow crops, get married, Buy animals and much more. If you think you will get bored of it after a few days your wrong There are so many things to do Like many festavols. when you start the game you might think its boring but play for two weeks of cleaning up yourfarm because after your farm is cleaned up its so much fun to play. I love this game I think you should Buy it right away if you can because if you don't It will be very hard to find."
3,Pretty fun,It's a cute game.I don't like the word cute.It's over used. This game is fun and quite colorful. enjoy. I recommend you do some gardening this spring and summer though and play this game on the side.
4,"Great, Great game... Missing some common sense features...","Harvest Moon 64 is one of the BEST games I've ever played- Whooping up on the awesome SNES version, it has beautiful graphics, great gameplay, and is loaded with fun... However, WHAT were the developers thinking when they decided that they wouldn't include controller pak support? STUPID! Also, on the beginning screen, you can choose which saved game to load- it only gives you the dudes first name, the year, and the season. Not the day or any other sorting info.Oh, and in reply to the gamer who said the game has a heavy emphasis on drinking, two things: You don't think farmers drink? YOU DO NOT NEED TO TOUCH A GLASS OF ALCOHOL TO GET AHEAD AS HE SAYS... Alcohol is just there and provides no function, but is a great waste of money!"
2,at first interesting but gets boring after awhile,"When I first played it, I thought i was pretty interesting. I could fall in love and a lot of stuff but after awhile I couldn't think of any more scenaireos. The days are too long, and they take forever. Also it is extreamely boring to watch. I watched my friend play it for four hours and I was about to fall asleep or die of boredom. It's great to rent, but don't buy it."
2,-,"well, this game , ithink, is just a bit too-blahh-.its probably just me, but this guy only walks! the days are too short, and there are too many things.of course if you want a game like this, skip my review, but this is what i think. i just hate this game!! annoying how slow this guy is! you cant ask a person the same question twice if you already have a wife.and there are like 30 people in the house. i just dont like it."
4,One of da best games ever.,"OK. I'm a guy and i do enjoy action. But this game is GREAT and it doesnt have any action violence. After you clean out the field in the beginning of this game, the fun begins. You can make friends, score with a lot of babes and marry one and have a kid, there's a lot of festivals to go to and races etc, you can build house extensions and of course, you can farm. WIth very few and very minor flaws and ok graphics, this game is worth your while and you should buy it if it's the only game for N64 that you buy."
5,Educational...yet entertaining!,"For those of you parents who are sick of killing and fighting in the games your child plays, this is the game for you( and your child). Who ever thought you could grow corn on a video game or chop wood to improve your home. This is about the funnest game I have ever played. It is a cross between Sim Farm and Zelda 64. You are a farmer who has been left with the family farm and it is up to you to turn it around and make a living off the land. But there is also a chance to find a wife, raise cattle, sheep, chickens, and win the contests at the llocal town. There is also a huge forest to explore with tonnes of fun surprises awaiting you. I'm gonna leave the rest up to you to discover, but dont be surprised if your chil starts to want to grow a garden, or go foraging in the mountains for mushrooms."
5,This game gets the whole family involved!,"Harvest Moon 64 was worth the wait! As a parent, I limit the playing time of video games. I do not limit the playing time of Harvest Moon 64. This is the neatest video game I have seen. The game is educational in the respect of the player having good work habits, good savings habits and they get to participate in festivals in the town. The player plants and tends their crops, chops wood, fishes, tends their animals (if they do not do this with care ~ it will cost them some of the earnings for medicine). Everyone that walks through the room, while this game is being played, just sits and watches and wants their turn. I highly recommend this game. Enjoy."
5,unbeliviablely cool,"This game is so cool for those who liked the this game will love the more improved and more 3d game of Harvest Moon. The game is so fun because you never run out of fun things to do. You can raise crops and sell them, raise livestock,get married,and even get adiitons on your small house.this game is great."
5,Farm livin' is the life for me!,"Harvest Moon 64 is an excellent game that follows in the footsteps of it's predicessors on earlier systems. If you enjoyed the other games, you'll LOVE this one. It's concept may seem simple, but the game is oddly addictive and quite fun. By combining farming vegetables with the need to raise livestock, be an active member of society, woo a girl(hopefully), and run around getting everything done, that games stays interesting. Although the days may seem to pass by too quickly at first, you'll be able to see it is done in the interest of preventing the game from drowning on too long. The music can get annoying, but you can play a cd in the backround. The graphics are claimed to be poor, but in truth, they aren't that bad. It's an excellent buy and although it's hard to determine what makes it so good, but it should please the adventure or RPG fan."
3,solid game but could've been MUCH better,"Harvest Moon 64 is a fun game, don't get me wrong. The only problem here is the fact that it could've been so much better. The graphics are mediocre; I find it hard to believe that this is the best they could do on a machine like the N64. Also, there are big black spaces at the edges of the screen prior to it scrolling. What?I still recommend buying this game, but hopefully they will get their act together and make the real deal version on the new Nintendo system.peace kt"
3,Harvest moon for Nintendo (short),this game is pretty fun but it is nothing compared to the game for Gameboy ..... and the one for DS is really different so these are probably the ones i would recommend .. especially the Gameboy one.
1,mrs,"I am a little irratated, as the cd sent to me could not be listened to. It skipped all the way thru. I returned it 2 days after I received it. I have heard not a word about it.This was ""Salute! The world war II tribute album."
4,Very good b book,"Very easy to read.Well written and researched. I really like it.I would recommend it for anyone interested in Canadian business history . What a fantastic concept - "" Fair Enterprise "". Amazing!"
4,great value,"look...i dont weant to kid anyone here. this is not a masterpiece, but it could be one day. there is a lot of potential. and for the price, i was pleased.took a little longer than other trees ive ordered, but not much. all in all was soon enough so the tree suffered little to no shock.one branch on the top was a bit damaged during the shipping to delivery, but for a tree to be mailed and shipped overseas i was expecting worse.tree was larger than i expected and even better shape than the one pictured, after mild pruning has taken a whole new life. pot is nice, but has a diffrent type of design on all 4 sides, but the photo only shows one.this tree is the best value ive found so far for trees on amazon, and ive ordered a few. if you want a better tree, you will pay a lot more and may be dissapointed. once again, not yet a masterpiece, but with some patience and attention to shape and detail, maybe oneday.......???"
3,"Hmmmmm, well it fit and looked good.","It was a good stereo, the nav was ok, the screen was useless and the ipod controls were a friggin joke. I expeced Way better from JVC"
1,If you own an IPOD-this is NOT the system for you. Run away while you can,"I have an 160 gig ipod with a ton of music on it and this unit has the worst navigation for an ipod thats on the market. I bought this item because it offered everything I wanted, but if I had the choice to do over-i would run for the hills. This unit is a piece of garbage. Go Apline"
1,the worst customer service ever,"DO NOT BUY JVC. They broke my car radio after sending it in for minor service repairs. It came back scratched up & broke the usb port, & said too bad we didn't do it."
2,Book should have been shorter,"I was intrigued at first by the main character, Christopher and Lee, but after reading more than half of the book I became bored. Too much angst and not enough substance. I would have liked to read more about Chistopher and his interactions with the people in his department, Judd and so on.I could understand Lee and her parenting/older woman issues, but I just found her kinda trite and goody two shoes.It the whole story line became like unto a family channel movie. Too sugary sweet with one dimensional characters.This is the first book I have read by LaVyrle Spencer, so I cannot compare it to her other books."
4,An emotionally charged ride. Bring lots of tissues!,"Once again LaVyrle Spencer brings us an emotionally charged book. A rollercoaster ride of true human emotion ranging from hell to heaven.Lee Reston widow, mother and business woman is once again confronted with personal tragedy when she learns her oldest son, Greg, has been killed while riding his motorcycle. Chris Lallek, Greg's best friend and roommate accepts the difficult responsibility of informing Lee of her loss. Together they grieve and give each other strength to get through this tragedy.Coming from a dysfunctional family, Chris has never known what it's like to be part of a ""normal"" family. Lee and her family include Chris in family and holiday get-togethers. They form a warm friendship which soon turns to feelings of love. They have many obstacles to overcome but in the end they find their happiness in being together as a real family.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope you will too.Cindy Jacob"
3,Touching But Generic,"Spencer is a master storyteller, it's true. This book is heartfelt and so moving, but why does everything in it have to be so painfully normal? Throughout the book, sexist cliches abound -- mothers clap for their sons playing football even though they don't know what's going on without a man to tell them, Lee can't fix stuff around her house, and everything Lee owns is flowery and what Chris owns is simple and plain. The characters always seem to be eating beef and ice cream. Lee's daughter Janice is just a normal, pretty girl with nothing interesting to her. Lee's son Joey is portrayed as the generic slightly slobby but lovable awkward young man. It's just so...Average America or something. I connect with the story but not with the uninteresting characters, I guess because their lifestyles are different than mine."
2,Soppy sophomoric pap written for teens but pawned on adults,"Written to the level that dreamy eyed 8th graders may find titillating. The story line is completely predictable. Each scene is repetitive in its descriptions of characters and their actions. Anyone who has never watched a single TV soap opera episode will be enthralled. Maybe her next novel will star Dick and Jane and Baby Sally! I gave it 2 stars because the author was able to get it published! And, because there were some 50-cent words thrown in to make it look intelligent!"
1,BAD condition,"If you are going to sell a book that has missing pages, a completely torn binding, and looks as if it has been tossed around like a football, then the condition should be listed as BAD. The book I bought from this seller was far from good, and completely unacceptable."
5,Beautiful Album!,John Stevens did such a beautiful job on this ablum. I would recomend this album to anybody. Red definatlly has something on it for everybody. Very Well done.
2,Weak: Dont attempt what you cannot improve,"if you want to hear these songs at their best, DO NOT listen to an overnight Television sensation.. you get what you pay for and these are good dive-bar type covers at best...Nothing to rave about or delve into.... like Michael Buble an imitation of an imiatation....save your money"
2,BORRRRRRRRRRING!!,"I really tried to like this cd. I thought he did a decent job on Idol. The uptempo songs are decent, but the ballads are just sleep inducing. I think I'll stick with Michael Buble' when I want to listed to a great young crooner."
1,BEWARE BEFORE YOUR PURCHASE!!!,"Um...this kind of music is from the fifties...which i knew before I bought it...but it had no likeability factor...he's just as boring as he was on the show...the songs become repetitive...so it bores you quickly...only two songs are worth listening to once in a while:""this love,"" ""come fly with me""...this cd however is not a ""classic"" and wont stay on my popular shelf for long...in fact...i already moved it...but then again if you are into the 50's music...then by all means purchase it..."
1,WHAT A TERRIBLE ALBUM!!!,"Who would of thought that boring John Stevens from American Idol would ever get a record deal...his record label is wondering how he got one also!!! He is so boring and his type of music went out of date like 50 years ago...this album is not for anyone except his true fans from American Idol..and all 50 of those fans have already reviewed this CD!!! HA HA!!! His rendition of ""THIS LOVE"" by Maroon 5 is a piece of trash!!! He just drags along with deep mindless chatter...the only thing this CD is good for is going to sleep...after the opening track you will be in dreamland for sure!!! DON'T BUY THIS CD...WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE THIS!!! A TRUE F !!!!"
5,"Allowed to sing his music, teenage crooner shines","Stevens brings his cross between Sinatra and Darin to a splendid compilation of crooning standards and some newer songs that work very well arranged for John's style (""Here, There, and Everywhere"" and the delightful ""This Love"" [Foreigner, Maroon5]). If there is only one thing I could wish from this album, it's that it were longer. At 36 minutes, it seems to me that three more songs could have added. But then again, maybe that's the idea, because John Stevens definitely leaves you wanting more."
4,surprisingly good,"I find myself listening to this cd quite a bit. It's true that his vocals are weak on some songs, but, overall his voice is pleasing and just right for this selection of songs. One reason this album is a winner is the music itself. He has chosen some of the best and most popular standards ever recorded and the production value is top-notch.He and Erika Christenson do a lively version of ""Let's Fall in Love"" which is my favorite song on this cd. His twist on the one current song he does, ""This Love"" is an interesting change of pace.All in all, it's a good first outing. I've never liked any version of ""Come Fly With Me"" and I skip over this one. However, how many cd's do you like every song but one? I don't plop my money down on many cd's but I'm glad I bought this one."
4,Great job by one so young!,"I first heard cuts from this CD on a Delta flight in June '06. John provided commentary on individual tracks and offered perspective on other artists tracks. I found the tracks presented clean and well done. John Stevens has a great voice - too good for American Idol. Further, he has a sense for what he sings beyond his years. The orchestrations behind the vocals are superb. My favorites are All of Me and Come Let's Fly Away. They are perky, sassy, and well-rendered. You can uderstand ALL the words on this CD and the artist truly gets outside himself because there is nothing specifically done for him. It is all about rendering a solid performance on steady claassics. I highly recommend this album (oops, can we call them that any longer?). You will find yourself listening over and over again and singing along. It doesn't get any better than that. John will find it difficult to up the standard on his next release."
1,"Waste of money, buy Bo instead","no good. John can't sing very well. Maybe he'll be better in a few years.Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad!"
5,Definitely Worth the Wait,"Well done, John, well done! My favorite music, done simply and beautifully, with no gimmicks. I, too, wish there had been more publicity for this excellent cd. My disc will seldom see the inside of its jacket; it will remain on my changer, to play often."
4,Nice!,"Not my favorite album, but very listenable and well produced. I like it mixed with other jazz vocalists."
4,Bravo John,"I am really impressed with this CD. It isn't easy to take these old standards and make them your own, but John has managed to do just that. True, he is young and his voice has some limitations, but I have the feeling that in time John will only get better and better. I hope he continues to record in this genre and I look forward to future CDs!"
4,RED - John Stevens,"This CD showcases John Stevens' talent much better then ""American Idol"" did. He sings the type of music he loves and he is fantastic at it. He has a smooth voice that compliments songs like ""Come Fly With Me"" and ""My Blue Heaven"". If you were a fan of John Stevens while he was on ""American Idol"" then this is a must have for you."
3,Not inspiring yet,"He has enthusiasm and attidude towards American Songbook but it has not come through, not yet. Probably it's not even fair to compare with greats like Frank, Bennett, Sammy Davis because he is not even at the starting point - not fair to these great singers, not to John. He might be an apparentice in Kevin Spacy school. His pharsing is flat and he often sounds rushed. He needs to learn to take time to communicate. With all said, I think he has potential and shows a glimmer of his own style, in songs ""Here, There and Everywhere"" and ""Shadows of Your Smile"". It is a mildly enjoyable CD with a good production value. So I'll keep it to see how he does next time. It's 2 and a half star rounded up to 3."
3,Mixed feelings,"On the one hand, Silent Night, Bloody Night is a superb slice (pardon the pun) of seventies' slasher fare. Definitely a cut (there I go punning again) above the rest. While the storyline is hardly original, it unfolds in a very unique manner and the film just oozes creepiness, with several good jolts along the way. On the other hand, this DVD release from Diamond Entertainment has to be one of the ugliest transfers I've ever seen. The film print is riddled with scratches and some scenes are so dark that you can barely see the action. However, if it's any consolation, the old VHS version on the Paragon label wasn't much better and since the film is highly recommended for any slasher fan, you'll just have to be content with this sub-par release until a reputable company such as Anchor Bay or Elite give it the proper remastering treatment it so rightfully deserves. I only gave it 3 stars because of the poor print quality. Otherwise, this baby would easily make the 5-star grade."
3,Family Issues..,"SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT concerns an old house that used to be a mental institution. In 1935 (on christmas eve), the ""inmates"" were released to murder their tormenting captors. In 1973, someone is killing people again, someone connected to the house and it's evil history. Why are certain victims being selected? What is their connection to that awful day in '35? John Carradine is one of those stalked by the insane killer. A surprising amount of gore will thrill gorehounds. No nudity or profanity. A nice twist near the end. Better than fruitcake for christmas..."
3,Strange,"Honestly I waited more from Silent Night, Bloody Night. I heard a lot about this movie, that made me import the dvd inedit in my country. It's a little confuse but it's very strange and belongs to a important period of creation of horror movies (early 70's). But it's an important film to horror collectors or appreciators. I like it in my collecion."
3,Silent Night Bloody Night,"This is one I remeber watching on our old B&W when I was a kid. To see it on DVD uncut was great, except for the transfer which at times is hard to watch. This is not your run-of-the-mill slasher flick but a more complex shocker that keeps you guessing and please watch this with someone, as you will be looking over your shoulder after it ends. This film is worth the seven bucks, I would definitly buy a better version from Anchor Bay if they ever made a copy. Hint, Hint."
2,Could be better,"A Christmas classic with some good actors,weak plot,and a poor quality transfer that looks like it was copied from VHS."
2,"Silent Night, Boring Night","Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with the brilliant Silent Night, Deadly Night) was a chore to sit through. It's only strong point is a bloody axe killing. I like Mary Woronov, but she is wasted here. The plot is slow and fairly confusing. And the movie only runs 79 minutes, but still feels overly padded. Rent Silent Night, Deadly Night 2 instead. Even Christmas Evil was slightly better than this mess."
5,Terrific new release!,"Very melodic with intricate rhythms and a complex tonal pallet. Despite its unique avant-garde edge, I found the music still tonal and accessible. Definitely this composer and album will be in my top ten for 20th/21st century music!"
4,Great Reference Book,"This book can be quite overwhelming to the first time user, but it definitely is a must for anyone studying to go into the field of psychology. It helps one understand and diagnose over 400 different mental disorders."
4,DSM,"I use this book for work and it is as expected. It arrived very soon after it was ordered, if I have any concern it is the book was supposed to be new but the cover of the book had some minor damage."
2,se borran las letras,"muy buena forma de ensenar a leer y escribir el espanol a los ninos mayores de cuatro anos, pero las letras de los cubitos se han empezado a despintar y yo tengo solo dos meses de haberlo empezado a utilizar por lo que no lo recomiendo ya que se borran las letras y ya no se podra utilizar."
5,Excellent Study of the Role of Family in Anorexia Nervosa,"In ""Psychosomatic Families: Anorexia Nervosa in Context,"" Salvador Minuchin and his co-authors argue that anorexia nervosa is not a neurosis that is limited to an isolated individual. On the contrary, they argue that anorexia belongs to an ailing social structure--specifically, that of the family. Minuchin's analyses of a variety of family therapy sessions both support this claim and reveal a number of communication patterns that are typically found in anorectic families--such as enmeshment, excessive tendencies to nurture or protect, and the failure to acknowledge or address emotional claims. Minuchin offers a unique and compelling analysis of anorexia nervosa that will be of interest to those who are studying or treating the neurosis as well as to those who are struggling with anorexia nervosa in their own lives."
5,Fanily Therapy,Recommended for those in the Helping Professions especially those working with Families as Family Counselors/Therapists from one on the intellectual giants in the field Salvador Minuchin whose genius becomes apparent as a change agent during his Therapy Sessions .Nestor Mantilla
1,blaming the parents again,"I read this book back in graduate school, and, knowing nothing then about living with an adolescent with anorexia, it seemed to me to be a perfectly fine text. However, now we've crossed over that bridge, and saw this develop in our daughter regardless of how we tried to prevent it.Blaming the parents is toxic, unhelpful, and thoughtless. Assigning causality (and thus blame) to traits you find in families going through these difficult situations when you should recognize that correlation is not the same as causality is really toxic. We no longer talk about the ""schizophrenigenic"" parent, and it is cruel to blame parents for their children developing a brain disease or disorder."
5,"Excellent information without ""scare tactics"" .","""This book gave excellent facts and information in a way that anyone can read and understand. The information was specific, sobering and helpful. The insight into the Christian beliefs were well said and the information on lists of books, magazines and web sites gave you additional places to go for more information. I have ordered more copies to give to friends."
2,Difficult and not rewarding,"This game seems like it was designed for an arcade stick, and seeing as how I do not have a dreamcast flightstick and have no knowledge of one or urge to buy one, I have to say that the dreamcast controller is not nearly adequate. Though the control scheme is fairly friendly, the sensitivity of the analog will send you flying into barrel rolls with a movement of a fraction of a degree, with no options that I could find to adjust this (though I didn't look hard, as I was far too disappointed with the game to keep going). Turning in formation is nearly impossible, and why would you want to if you couldn't swoop in on enemies together. Because there are none. No guns. No nothing. It's like cheese pizza: it's still kinda good, but you feel like it isn't complete.I borrowed it from a friend and couldn't stay on it for more than ten minutes."
1,Waste of money,"The alternate name for this game, Aero Dance, describes how much fun this game is. It might as well be a game about dancing. If you ""break formation"" you have to wait through 30 seconds of loading, exit a replay, wait 30 more seconds to load, hit retry, and wait 30 more seconds. Don't buy, rent, or even steal this game; it's not worth it. This game should be called ""Aero... through the wallet."" If you like fun games, I suggest Test Drive 6, Hydro Thunder, NFL 2K (blows me away), Toy Commander, or anything else but this one."
3,bugs? bugs! bugs!,"I bought the book. I already work with basic html daily at my workplace. I entered the code of the first 5 lessons in BBedit and ran the BBedit editor. What a mess!!tags are not closed, <tr> and <td> tags are not closed. The editor's mistake finder was running out of space. Did they bother to check and edit their work before the book went to print? Did they create a new version of HTML? Confusing to say the least! In the chapter about designing with side to side tables, they forget to mention that the space between the tables will stretch wider with larger monitors, which renders the effect unstable. I really wonder if the book was reviewed and edited before it went to print. What a pity, it could have been great."
2,Another Reader,"I bought this book last winter of ""97"". I was glad there was a book designed for Tables and Frames but after working on my web page I found this book to be somewhat confusing. I know it is rated advance but would have like to see more visual examples to go along with the HTML code. Also the code was written in a way where it was not easily readable.It was arranged in sections. I was hoping to see all of it together. On the good points I did learn more terminology on HTML"
2,Definitely Not good but Not entirely worthless,"Lemay books are generally overhyped trash and this is no exception. I friend told me to mentally transpose the e and the a next time I shop for books to ensure I don't make the same mistake yet again. Out of 600 pages about half are filler, background stuff and other junk, that won't help you at all. Which leaves about 300 pages of which half are pictures and worthless examples. Toss out the 100 pages of fluff in the appendix and you are left with about 50 pages of stuff that you may be able to use. In the end you have to ask yourself do you really want to shell out $39.99 or whatever Amazon charges for a book that will leave you frustrated and feeling ripped off even after you search out the aforementioned 50 pages that may be useful"
1,"Terrible, not very helpful","I found that this book was terrible and didn't help at all with my web page coding. The CD had very few things that the book related to, and 90% of the book was dedicated to a simple table. Then the book did a ""Quantam Leap"" to extremely complicated CSS. Not worth the money!"
5,I Concur... This book has a wealth of useful information,"I needed something more comprehensive and revealing than the usual offering of beginners texts. Yet, I WAS a beginner.This book not only covers the general abilities of Acrobat, it discuses little known intricacies and technical issues that will make you a power user in record time.Remarkably, the information is explained in simple, ordinary language."
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased both the red and blue flip lenses for use with the Streamlight Strion LED flashlight. The fit is too tight. The flashlight inserts into the assembly halfway at best, which seems to limit the full functionality of the colored lenses. The hinge mechanism is flimsy and weak. This will not hold up in the field. The colored lenses themselves are secured by small plastic tabs. One tab has already broken off the blue lens. The blue lens does not filter to 460 nm. If that is what you are looking for, this is not the filter for you. It's difficult not to be disappointed, but for the price, I'm not too surprised. Amazon was great!"
5,Murder Mystery,"Most murder mystery/detective stories leave me sadly disappointed. Lawrence Christopher's All About Mary, however, was an exceptional read and kept me guessing until the very end. Well written and provocative, All About Mary is a superb novella with fascinating characters (Smoke was my favorite!). I can't wait to read another tale with Mick Hart racing against the clock to track down a killer!"
5,My son loves this!,"I got this as a Christmas present for my 10 year old. Before this, he was only into his GI Joe action figures. But after he got this he's been fingerprinting everything in the house.The kit comes with a black light and some ink that's only visible under the UV light. He asked me to set up challenges for him so I used the ink to write an ""invisible"" treasure map with such things as ""Find 3 objects in the living room marked with an invisible fingerprint"".Plus, the UV light is fun to play with on it's own. You think your house is clean, and then you see glowing stuff with the black light. I don't know what it is, but I'm going to have to get some industrial strength cleaner, LOL. Don't get this if you're a germaphobe. ;-)I think it's a great educational toy for kids AND it lets this me play actively with my son. It's so much better than sitting in front of the TV!"
2,Product Has So-so Performance,"My 8 year old son purchased this product with his allowance. The fingerprint dust does not work - it does not dust on and show fingerprints and therefore you can't lift the prints with the pieces of clear tape. I am very disappointed that a company with such a good reputation for quality products would sell a fingerprint kit that doesn't lift fingerprints. I called customer service and they sent another bottle of fingerprint dust but it didn't work properly either. If all you want to do is make ink fingerprints, buy it. Otherwise, try another product."
1,herb fan,"I will admit that the herb farm in Fredricksburk is a wonderful place to eat or stay. This cookbook on the otherhand was a waste of my money. The majoirty of the recipes call for special mixes that are only available from the Herb farm. I found this to be VERY frustrating. It was a nicely put together book, but as for true recipes, it was mostly dissapointing."
5,better flow and no wasted air,"Coupler sets don't seem like a big deal but this one makes it WAY easier attach and detach tools. No more pinched skin or air shooting out. It's a little expensive, but well worth it. And you'll only need to buy one set!"
3,Medicore at Best,"This is a medicore book that spends quite a lot of time and chapters on programming Mindstorms with other langagues and APIs.I found ""Core LEGO MINDSTORMS Programming: Unleash the Power of the Java Platform"" by Brian Bagnall to be a much better book. It is well suited to both beginning and advanced programers. It covers languages basics, but still provides much info to experienced Java developers.It also includes detailed instructions and pictures describing on basic robotics...things like how to turn a rotary motion to a linear motion, how to change gear rations, how to build differentials, and much more.There is also a detail chapter devoted to building your own homebrew sensors that even someone with little to no experience in electronics could easily build.In short, this book is ok, but there are better alternatives out there."
5,Milstein por siempre,"Estas grabaciones de Miltein a pesar de tener casi cincuenta años, son insuperables. Si bien el sonido de las grabaciones actuales es mejor, estas dos no desmerecen. La musicalidad que imprime Milstein a su interpretación entendida esta como la versión personal de lo que otro escribió adquiere un nuevo sentido, para recomendar la Chaconne de la partita N 2. Tengo Versiones de Zsering, Grumieux y otros pero estas son sin duda la guía de los demás."
3,not bad,"The atlas is not bad. It has some nice pictures that create interest. On the whole, I found it lacking. It is what it advertises itself to be: a ""concise"" atlas. I would prefer having a more complete atlas, like Sacred Bridge. I didn't find that it discounted the Bible as historically accurate, but it does take a critical approach, so some might be uncomfortable with some of the assertions it makes about the history of the Patriarchs, etc."
3,not what I expected,"I was hoping to get more emotional support from this , but it just doesnt reach my goal of that"
3,"It's OK, but not as good as I'd expected","Although there is just one puzzle to a page, some of them are printed very small, leaving lots of excess space on the page. In addition to the usual 9-figure puzzles, some are only the numbers 1-6, and others are the numbers 1-8. This book isn't really what I had hoped it would be, but others might find it interesting."
5,WOW!!!!,"This is the first record of Lacrimosa.At that time(1991) it wasn't a band: it was the project of THILO. But it's wondrful. There are no comments.""Seele in Not"" is magical piece and on,and on,and on........Try also to get ""EINSAMKEIT"" and ""SATURA"".JUST NO COMMENTS."
1,Stupid!!,This book was a waste of my money. Very stupid and boring. Thanks for nothing Malaika Adero!!
3,"Good, but not what it could have been.","If you are reading this review, you probably already know how insane the Locust are. This EP is good and crazy in the style of the Locust, but it is also lacking in some aspects. This EP has two songs on it, both of which are longer than any other by the Locust. But really, they are a bunch of short songs connected by bleeps and bloops. It's just like listening to something from Plague Soundscapes, except it been made longer by somewhat ambient sounds that connect everything together. It takes something away from the over all effect because you'll be getting into the song and the next thing you'll hear is some bloops instead on another instense song. It's good if you really like the Locust, but it's not a good place to start with them."
5,A welcome departure,"The Locust have finally stopped being noisy for cute's sake. This is by far their most serious and focused recording. A lot of longtime Locust fans might not appreciate this new, much more experimental direction.The album only two tracks, both of them around 5 minutes long, and instead of being an aural barrage from start to finish, the music actually slows down at points. It's downright ambient at times. Also new is the inclusion of real singing, which all four of the band members pull off quite well.It seems like they're finally living up to their potential."
2,i dont know what to say,"I usually can listen to the more Avant-garde side of hardcore and metal (things such as Blood Brothers (their older stuff), Plot To Blow Up The Eiffel Tower, and almost anything with Mike Patton in it) but i cant seem to get myself to like this. A friend of mine gave me this cd as a gift, and i've tried to like it, but it just wont grow on me. The music is good, its basically fast as hell over blast beats, and the songs are only an average of 60 seconds in length. Unfortunatly it never really draws me in. I am glad to see that there is still originality left in music but this isnt my cup-o-tea."
3,Too Much Crap,"Plague Soundscapes is definatly a better cd than this. the fact that it only has two tracks pretty much forces you to listen to the ambient crap which is just aggrivating. the actual songs are good but the self titled full length is much better, even though the songs arent much different. burn it, dont buy it."
3,"Luckily Its Just an EP, right?","Ok, so I bought this disc after being told how amazing it was. Now, dont get me wrong, I love the locust. But this is (musicly) dissapointing from them. Musicly I feel its not up to par with their other releases. None of the riffs get caught in my head, unlike Plague Soundscapes and FOTWL. But I do like the concept. If you play this disc for background noise, you will not get anything from it (If you play it backwards you get a neat surprise). But if you listen closely, you will hear some neat sounds. I also feel that this is a HUGE mistake from The Locust to charge cd price for an ep. Im sure they're laughing at all us idiots right now. While counting their money of course. Im looking forward to the next full length."
1,not very good,"This is among the worst albums I've ever heard. The album cover is great, I also like the album title, and song names. If you love ambient soundscapes, screaming, and lack of focus, this album may entertain you. The art is good, as well as the song titles. But that doesn't equal good music.This album receives only one star since that is the lowest I could rate it. It owes me some stars actually."
1,This was a big mistake,"It is bit late to write a review of this crappy printer. Like other reviewers i have had the ""send the print three times"" problem, i have also had to change toner and the drum units twice in its lifetime. Its total prints so far in its entire 2.5 years we have owned this is 12,000 copies. It is rated at 35,000 per month. We have barely used this thing and it is dead. Lousy driver, gobbles toner, glitchy print connection and now it is starting to squeal and will not print in color. I am throwing it out this week. It is an expensive mistake."
1,Horrible Driver,"We've had this printer at work for about a year. We have it hooked up to one computer, and shared over the network. Almost daily, I have to reboot the computer it's hooked up to make the printer work again. I've tried connecting with both the parallel cable, and the USB cable. I've hooked it up to an XP computer, and now more recently to a server running Windows Server 2003 Small Business Edition. Same problem. When it does print, the quality and speed are good, but what good is a printer that doesn't print half the time, and ties up my time working on it when I could be working on real projects? By now, the lost labor of working on this printer would have easily been offset by buying a better printer to begin with. I'll be very wary before buying another Minolta printer."
2,Big Headache,"We've had this printer for our small business for about 6 months now. At first it seemed like a dream other than how noisey it is and how long it takes to warm up. Then we started having problem after problem with it and to this day it gives us trouble. Their telephone support is great, but we shouldn't have to call them as often as we do. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Beware,"You've got to yank out the paper to print an envelope! What were they thinking (apparently, they weren't)."
1,Massive Driver Issues on a Network!!,"After having owned the 2200 version of the Minolta Color series, I was very pleased with the product. Naturally, I assumed a newer model would be at least as proficient as an older model - never have I been more incorrect!I purchased 2 of the 2300W printers on March 5, and after spending countless hours on the phone with Tech Support, and having one of their reps confirm that their drivers are ""questionable"" - 20 days later I am boxing both printers back up and returning them!Moral - Newer is not always better!!"
5,So far so good,"Seems to be a great printer, drivers work well, no XP trouble. Prints slow (One page per 50-60 seconds) with long pauses between pages, till the entire print job is spooled, then easily meets the specs of 4 pages per minute. TIP: Since I routinely print 200-300 pages per job, I set the driver to NOT print first copy till the entire job spools; The job spools much more rapidly and then the printer prints continuously. Now I am much more than pleased.Had it for about 45 days and have done about 2000-3000 bochures so far. Print quality is excellent to my eye.Spec alert! You cannot upgrade the memory of this printer, in spite of what the specs say on Amazon! 32megs is built in, and that is what you have to live with."
5,Great Personal Laser Printer,"I have had the printer for only a few days so far, and it has been the best printer for the price. It is also the smallest color laser printer i have seen so far. When it comes to speed the printer has it and this has been the best laser printer for color pictures that i have ever used. The print quility is far greater than any other color laser printer i have used in the past."
4,Print Server for Minolta/QMS Magicolour 2300W,"Finaly found a print server that works with the Minolta Magicolour 2300W. Although not on the published compatability list I took a chance and bought the EDIMAX GDI Print Server Model PS-1216U. This print server is available for aprox $30.00 US.. + shipping... The server comes with a CD which includes SW to install drivers which links Minolta GDI driver with the Print Server...The server uses a usb2 interface to connect with the GDI prnter. I now have it working and have printed a few pages from my WinXP pc.. So far so good....The product claims includes suport for Win 2K, vista and windows 7 .. but I did not test these... The server has a built in webpage for device configuration... The server can also be setup using the included setup/installation software."
3,Well-written and interesting; slight flaws,"This book contains a variety of interesting bits of trivia and it is written with a voice that keeps the reader interested. Scientific facts and principles are presented in a manner accessible to a general audience, but they are not so overly simplified that a scientist becomes bored.The only serious shortcoming is that sometimes the biological background of the author demonstrates fundamental deficiencies in understanding physics. While these errors did not really subtract from the main points being made, physicists and engineers may occasionally become irritated."
2,Not Great,"I read her most recent book first (2012) and did not reach much of this. Not in depth enough, I was looking for more science."
2,Wordy & Overpriced!,"Marso is excessive in her use of flowery language. Her writing is far too wordy to be enjoyed by the average reader. Many sentences take up an entire paragraph when the intended point could easily be made using far fewer words. I admit, I'm no scholar, but the work would be more fruitful if Marso's intended message were easier to comprehend. I found it necessary to reread every other paragraph in order to make connections, yet I was never certain of what Marso wished to communicate. With all of the excess in Marso's use of language, I mentally cried out, ""Just say what you mean!"" Furthermore, in my opinion the book is seriously overpriced. Nearly fifty dollars for a 165 page paperback seems excessive. Had it not been required reading for my class I would never have purchased it, much less finished reading it."
4,Hypnotic,"Hypnotic electronica-tinged piano balladry, with soft, beautiful vocals and instropective lyrics that hint at post 9/11 angst. Sarah Fimm has a perfect, downtempo soundtrack for the post-election blues. Perfect for fans of Tori Amos or Happy Rhodes."
3,marooned with a marine,"This book was entertaining but so predictable. The heroine was a weak and indecisive woman. The story centered too much around their waiting out the storm. This book would have been better if the characters developed into a more in depth story line. I felt the story was a simple idea that did not contain enough to fill the pages of a book. The story did not ""wow"" me over."
2,Hey Marine-you can do better than this woman!,"...I have read two previous books in this series and liked them. Not this one though. The back cover description makes it sound like Sam wants sex, what he wants is an explanation for the break-up, which he never got. Karen is running away from the death of her first love, a marine Gunnery Sergeant. So how believable is it that she would date, let alone love another one? Because that's what she whines about-'you're going to die, and I'm afraid' just about through the whole book. Sam deserves better. That's why it got 2 stars instead of one, cause I liked the hero-I just wish the author had given him a better book."
5,"Doesn't rust, and does the work.","It does what it should do without any hassle. Both the straight cut and designed cut comes out great. Also, very easy to wash it afterwards. Great product!"
4,A nicely priced item that widens two-way communication.,"I work at a university in California as a maintenance worker. My boss and I have to keep in touch in order to best meet the needs of our housing residents. Before we used the Cobra Micro Talk 1 we relied on our campus pager system. This was not an effective method since we had to find campus phones and wait until the other person responded to the page. With the Micro Talk 1 we are able to connect quickly and effectively. We can now communicate in seconds instead of minutes. The battery life is long because of the stand-bye feature, we have been able to use them for several weeks before the batteries run low. The only down side to the Micro Talk 1 is that we sometimes have to deal with other radio traffic because of the two-channel limitation."
3,"""...Sell Like a Madman"" revisited","I read Ralph Roberts' previous book, ""Walk Like a Giant, Sell Like A Madman"" prior to reading this one. I found the information much the same, but organized differently.Taken on a week-by-week basis as Mr. Roberts recommends, it could be a useful guide for your business. It's a basic reminder to us that it's the little things that count with our existing and future customers."
5,Easy to read!,"I read this easy-to-read book, cover to cover in less than 3 hours! I couldn't put it down. It is full of practical sales advice from someone who's been there, has done that. Very inspiring!"
2,not helpful to me,I'm a new agent and I don't think this book is very helpful. The information in it is pretty obvious and not specific enough to help me. I think the book is a waste of money.
2,not for complete beginners,"this tutorial requires a working knowledge of both sheet music and the concertina instrument. there is an overview of reading sheet music and a diagram of note placement on the concertina keyboard, but no adequate connection between the two. after that is simply follow the sheet music to play the song in the accompanying video. I look at the lessons and am completely lost."
4,Whoa!,"whoa!!!this book was Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!the group of 'remnants' has been split up: Jobs,Violet,Yago,2Face,and the rest are still a board the ""Constitution"" sailing with nowhere to go,while Mo'steel,and Billy have just met two of the lost ""remnants"",Kubrick,and his father Alberto.Someone aboard ""Mother"" has done something to Kubrick though,they have replaced his skin with a clear almost shiny substance...Now they just have to figure out how to get out of the ""basement and get up to the rest of the Group....Up back on the ship 2Face and Yago are trying to start a civil war among the group,by asking who should be the leader?"
4,another hidden gem!,"I have to admit that I can't take this cd out of my cd player......and I am an adult! What I like most is that this was written by a master theater composer that understands the middle school voice. Although they scream a little on the cd from time to time--it is true to style and it is still ( even though Schwartz is older) fashion forward in many ways. The best songs are: New Kid, Big Red Plane, Trick or Treat, Look Up Above You. From what I understand, he started writing this years ago and it was shorter. Schwartz makes musical references to his old musicals........themost obvious reference I can hear is from Baker's Wife ( Meadowlark).I hope the story is as good as the musical writing here!"
5,i purchased this for a friend she vthought it was epic,I purchased this for a friend who was a classically trained ballarina and is now disabled and she thgought the dvd was breathtaking and loved every second of it and is now going to purchase more on her own now that she knows were to look Janet if you read this i still think of you nearly every minute of every day.
5,simply wonderful,"A real, crude, fascinating, inspiring and down to earth portrait of latest stars and coming up dancers which will probably change the viewpoint of some cynic ballet critics and followers. A must have if you believe that hard work and humbleness should be the ingredients to conquer any form of art at top level!"
4,Ballerina=strength,"This documentary is compelling viewing. One sees the process, and the determination that the young girls have.......and the struggle to maintain an almost impossible ideal."
4,Pretty,"I was expecting more, but this might be because of having just bought 'The Dancer' which is a much more in intimate experience, behind the scenes. I loved the cross-section of truly talented ballerinas that were featured. I wish there had been more backstage, warming up moments. And I'd also wished their had been more scenes dancing. The ballerinas talked a little more than I'd liked. Dance is best explained thru watching dance. That said, I've watched 5x since I got it two weeks ago, so it does fulfill the ballerina 'fix' when you need one. I'm glad I bought it. I do absolutely love the ballerinas in it. I love how when a ballerina takes off her toe shoes and just walks down the street you can't tell what a tower of strength and determination she is, she seems just like a regular girl.... it's like having a super-power. Lovely women, all."
3,Overdone,"I'm editting my review, b/c I went back and listen to the album a couple more times. It's not as bad as I originally thought, but the way some of their best tracks (Hey Girl, Might Shift, and About Mr. Brown) are slaughtered is inexcusable. On the other hand, this album is worth having if only for Delicate Few, If Only She Knew, and Somewhere Down the Road.The fact remains, however, that nothing O.A.R. has every released on an album does justice to the amazing live shows they perform. My suggestion stays the same - leave this on the rack and save your money for the double live album..."
1,What happened?!,"I thought The Wanderer was the best cd ever. I wore that one out at parties until finally someone swiped it from me. Crazy Game of Poker was amazing. Then, I got Souls Aflame and had a lot of fun listening to that. So, I knew Risen, their 3rd effort, would be a sound purchase, right? Wrong. What happened?! They threw in a couple new songs, but the old ones have all been ""Hootie'd out"". Want to hear Hootie and the Blowfish sing Night Shift? Me neither! I was thoroughly disappointed. Risen wasn't as raw (or upbeat) as the first two albums, and the band didn't sound like they were having anywhere near the fun they used to. As a result, it was no fun listening to. Sorry, folks. The Wanderer and Souls Aflame should be part of every music lover's collection, but I wouldn't suggest Risen to anyone."
5,Staying Strong,"OAR has done it again! Mixed with old tunes and bringing a new track list, this album has topped the others! Can't wait for the new one! Work it guys!!"
4,Statement in Time,Looking through one of these book with the great many pictures I sometimes hope to see my Grandfather who served in WWII in Italy. Or since I do research for the family tree I look for simple books that delve into the War that gives me some info on what he went through since he is no longer here so I can not ask.The quotes were interesting and pictures are a statement in time but I wanted more out of it then it had. So while it is a good coffee table book that will stand the test of time but does not tell all of the story.
3,Life in World War II America.,"Life has always excelled at getting great pictures of our society and this is the case with this book. There is some minimal writing to complement this book, but it is mainly a picture book, and a brief one at that. The pictures are great but there is not a lot of meat to this book.For those interested in visiting the past through pictures, this is a great book. For those interested in trying to understand this period in the life of America, one will need to try elsewhere for a better book."
5,"If You Build With Wood, You'll Love These","I have been building and repairing with Fastap screws now for years and once you've used them you'll never go back to a commodity type screw product. Really, they are that good. First of all they are made from a larger diameter wire than commodity products so they won't snap off the heads like the cheap screws do. They also have what they call ""Power Point Technology"". This self drilling feature makes installation into just about any wood easy and fast. Even wood seasoned by years of use like in a remodel or something. I use my trusty 12 volt cordless drill with them but they can be installed easily with a less powerful cordless too (I started out using a 6 volt). A great product (they come in other varieties besides stainless BTW), that may seem a little pricey at first but their performance is well worth the extra cost."
2,Don't waste your money on this book.,"I am a figurative painter and I have read this book. I can only conjecture that all the recent publicity about Richard Schmid has raised the price of this book to the outer limits!I was glad I didn't fall into this price-hipe trap. The book originally sold for around $12.95 and I think that as a book that is what it is worth. I have the same sentiments for ""Richard Schmid paints the landscape"". If you are an artist I recommend the most recent book, ""Alla Prima Painting "" which is still way overpriced at $100. but if it is Mr. Schmid's technique and experience you are after this will help you to understand his thoughts, philosophy and technique a little better. Book collecters may feel differently about the inflated price. I am not writting for their benefit but for the artist or art enthusist."
3,overpriced,"I have other books by Richard Schmid. The price for this book, however, is extremely overpriced. The range of $200 to $400 for a used book of this size is much too high His later book ""ALL I know about painting"" is worth much much more. I paid $100 for this book 6 years ago (new)."
2,The information is good but difficult to find.,The book is hard to follow. It has only been useful in my last month of pregnancy. The way the book is structured does not permit you to get ready a little bit every month which was my objective in purchasing this book.
5,A top pick for parenting collections,"A child is not a matter to take lightly. ""Getting Organized for Your New Baby"" is a guide to covering all your bases when a new life is going to become your responsibility. With tips on tricks on everything from conception to the early formative years and all the details in between, two experienced women who have learned through their own hardships and lack of preparation brought them. A must read for any woman who wants to become a planned mother, ""Getting Organized for Your New Baby"" is a top pick for parenting collections."
1,Terrible!,"This is probably the worst textbook I have ever had to use after finishing a bachelors in biology! There is an incredible amount of errors that make this book lose all credibility. I would not trust any other book from either of these authors. I wonder if they ever had it proof read. There was a minimum of 5 errors PER CHAPTER! In my opinion, there shouldn't even be 5 errors in an entire textbook being used at universities. After reading just 2 chapters in this book I couldn't trust any of the information it was giving me because I was afraid it was another error. It makes the learning process take MUCH longer. If you ever have a choice, do not get this book. Plead with professors to use another book because this book will stunt your learning and put you in risk of getting the wrong information and a bad grade. AVOID THIS BOOK!"
2,Error filled,"This is the 7th Edition, and has an orange cover. There have been so many errors in this textbook as well as the solutions manual that our course professor gives extra credit to those who point the errors out first in the problem sets. And this is the 7th Edition? Give me a break.Errors include giving the wrong fractional values for specific genetics problems. Equations needed on the test are stated incorrectly in the text. The few answers that they give you in the back of the text book also contains errors. In the solutions manual I recall they were base pairing A with G and T with C, which resulted from a formatting error.How do you get to the 7th Edition of a book and have so many GROSS errors in a college level textbook? This leads me to believe that the source is Greed, when I see the price this book cost at the university bookstore and the gross negligence of failing to even proofread parts of the text before printing this error filled text."
2,Too much fluff,"This book might be good if used as a secondary reference for an introductory class, but it is definitely not a title I would recommend for someone trying to teach themselves about the subject. I felt constantly like I was being talked down to. The authors waste your time with unnecessary stories about so-and-so with such-and-such genetic disorder, along with space in the book for accompanying pictures. Sentence structure is poor; the text feels as if it were written around a multiple-choice test.Another reviewer said that this text could be used for grad students; I would tend to disagree. Grad students are accustomed to getting a bit more respect from their textbooks. By this point in our academic careers, we aren't going to pay attention just because you threw in a picture of a cat (yep, see page 29)-- we're here for the science.Generally speaking, it's not a book to read if you just want to know the science of genetics and understand the moving parts."
3,Not what's is shown on the picture.,"The product is fine. But it is not what is pictured. The image clearly shows a detachable USB cable between the AC Adapter and the base. You can not detach the base case with the AC Adapter. If you were thinking that you could use this with micro USB, you can not. This is only for mini-usb."
5,The Finest Shave,"In my 30+ years of shaving, I have never had a shave as comfortable and nick free as I have with this product. I would especially recommend it to those who wear facial hair other than a full beard. The lube goes on basically translucent, so you can see where you're going and create an accurate hairline.Yes, it's kind of expensive, but it goes a long way. I would estimate that I get 60 shaves from one tube.Of all the products needed for proper men's skin care (scrub, face wash, shaving cream/gel, post-shave lotion, moisturizer/sunscreen), I would say that the shave cream/gel is the most critical for maintaining good looking skin. Less expensive products in all the other categories are more than acceptable (Nivea products are especially good). Splurge in one category, and make it the shave cream/gel/beard lube.Highly recommended."
4,Good for My Purpose,"I use this to prepare my beard for my wet/dry electric shaver. Since it doesn't foam as much as other shaving creams/gels do, it doesn't clog the shaver or make it hard to clean. There's definitely less mess. For blade shaving I've not found it to lubricate enough. Perhaps with more practice on my part, it would be fine."
3,It is just above average,"I got it on basis of reviews.Yes, its good but not awesome.I am looking for something even better!And if your face is not well washed or if you have not taken a shower and try to shave, using this cream will not help you avoid cuts and abrasions on your face and neck.Buy it but don't expect it to be sensational.Having said that, Jack Black is a awesome brand."
4,"Handy, Useful Guide","This guide is useful to a certain extent. It does go a bit far by saying remember to put your name on the manuscript. Only joking, its brilliant!!!!!"
3,It's good for what it is,"I really like the Nancy Drew books and games, I think this one was a little too hard though. It was difficult to complete the tasks you are given for the internship. I also didn't see the point in them, it was difficult work that didn't apply to the mystery. There was just too many tasks for a simple mystery."
4,Interesting characters; etc.,"It's worth the purchase.Very good graphics, sound effects, background music, and interesting interaction with characters. The historical aspect adds interest, as well. You have plenty of tasks to perform, and if you get stuck, you can find help via phonecalls in the game; or online at Her Interactive web site forum. Keep pen and paper nearby to take notes!My favorite Nancy Drew games are: Danger on Deception Island, Secret of Shadow Ranch, and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake. I like all of the ND games, however, and have played all more than once."
1,This thing is a piece of junk,"Incredibly disappointing. The clock is tiny for the price, difficult to program and was broken when received. I could not rotate the dial at all. I had my husband try and the clock broke in the process."
4,I love this!,"I really fell in love with this product. If you use it correctly you won't feel the initial pain of penetration. I used a medium sized amount placed outside, then lubed up the runway let it sit for about 2-4 minutes before attempting full penetration. It works great! Only reason it only has 4 stars I ordered cherry and received regular."
1,no good,it did not work on me and that sucks becauses my hubby loves anal and it just made it hurt more
3,not this time,didn'twork as it said it would it didn;t burn but it made it feel more iritable then enjoyable it did make you numb i wouldn;t buy it again not because it didn;t work it just didn;t do good for me
5,Best Sports Documentary Availible on the life of an Athelete,"This film by far is one of the best real life documentaries that I have seen on a professional athlete from any sport and for certain professional wrestling.Chris Adams at one time was a superstar, through this film you get to look into the life of someone that was once famous and loses their glory going through life. It is incredible the amount of damage that one can do to themselves by not choosing their friends and path in life wisely.This film is exciting and worth while to see. Even if you are not a wrestling fan you will enjoy this documentary which journeys through ones life that ultimately leads them to a tragic death.Job well done to the Director Mickey Grant! This was well put together!"
3,Just ok,"I made the decision to view, this as a rental, on Amazon. It was my first rental and I don't know if the terrible connection was my new computer or with Amazon. Although the video is worth watching I was glad I viewed it as a rental and didn't have to sit in anticipation for it's arrival. It was a very well made documentary and it's worth watching just to see his ""stripper"" friend. These were everyday people telling the story of their lost friend including a Kevin Von Erich who didn't bother to get out of the hot tub to do the interview. I can only give it 3 stars because there was nothing truly outstanding about the material. I'd like to see a series of these featuring World Class Wrestling stars like Gino Hernandez."
1,BAD TASTE,"The peanuts were bitter and had a bad chemical taste. I gave some to my great-niece and she mentioned the bad taste, also. I threw them away."
3,"A delightful read, with a few down points","Elise and Jared are wonderfully developed characters in this book, realistic. Debra's writing also sparkles. However, there are some points at which I felt almost ready to put the book down, and did skip over many pages. The only two full love scenes in the book happened at moments when romance would definitely be the furthest from my mind. Not to give the story away, but when Elise and Jared should be worrying about either finding her brother alive, as a threat has been placed on him, or in killing the bad guy, they are more than a little busy making love. I found little enjoyment in those scenes considering I had far too much worry for the actual plotline and characters. The romance became secondary to me here. Though I do look forward to a book about Logan and Dru. One can hope."
2,Misleading item description,"Although I did get a genuine MB-D200 Battery Grip (which works great, by the way) the item description and write-ups should have disclosed that the batteries included were not made by Nikon but by CTA. That way, buyers know exactly what they are buying."
4,more platinum,once again not a knock off. the real deal platinum gems perfect size and weight heavy but not to heavy. excellent clasp.
5,Sweet and gritty,"This novel is properly about teen troubles and lesbian love (teenage and adult). As might be expected from an expert author of speculative fiction (the Isis series), the narrative concerns itself with the sociological dimension of the characters' adventures. The writing is excellent (Stewart has a real gift for bringing settings to life, and her Seattle is so much more physically immediate than the futureworld of Isis, it feels you're IN it while you read), and for some reason the teenagers in the story get the really hot (and achingly tender) lovemaking scenes. Isis, with its lesbian warrior society, offers nothing so intense as the erotic writing these kids elicit. I'm hoping the physicality in ECB will transfer over to and heighten that of the forthcoming Isis stories."
5,LIfe on the streets,"I love all of Jean Stewart's books but this one is my favorite. She has become one of my favorite writers. She is always fresh and intriguing. But this book is something altogether different from her other books. Here, Ms. Stewart presents a story all too close to home.Here we have the story of a young girl cast out onto the streets. She is unloved and unwanted. She must survive in a bitter and unforgiving world. But with the help of another of life's castaways she will not only survive but thrive.This story really made me think. Too many children are cast out this way. Too many children are forced to face a loveless life. It is inspiring to read such a tale of survival. Jean Stewart has captured the essence of the street in this novel. She has also captured the essence of love. What a remarkable novel. I loved it."
1,You'd think an SF Writer,"...wouldn't have to use the title of an SF story published in 1988 (""Emerald City Blues,"" Steven R. Boyett, MIDNIGHT GRAFFITI Magazine, Fall 1998)."
4,Hulk Head Cover,Great looking...big hit with people and fits nicely.. only downside is the sock part has ripped several times and i have to keep getting it re-stitched
3,Could be better,"Started out GREAT, picked up everything - a couple of months later, and with DAILY cleanings of filters, the self propelling stopped, and the suction faded. Also, the vacuum burned my large throw rug in 3 places -I'm guessing it got to hot. But that's what happens when you have to continually vacuum until all the dog hair gets picked up. Replaced filter soon after - worked well again for 2 weeks - again with DAILY filter cleanings (after each use) & suction is going again. I wrote the company to complain since it's under warranty over 6 months ago - and NO ONE has ever answered. I will NEVER giver HOOVER my money again."
1,Just Nasty!!!,I had this vacuum for about a month. The suction was so bad that after EVERY room I had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction. I hated it! Not only that but the bagless was a pain! I had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy! Not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever. It made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in! I did not want that in my house! I absolutely hated this vacuum!
4,Hoover U5752-900 Bagless WindTunnel Upright Vacuum,"Vacuum works great, easy to use and store. The no bag feature is wonderful."
2,I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS KINDLE BOOK 5 STARTS BUT...,"...it isn't very easy to navigate through...at least, I couldn't figure out a way to do so! (If I'm missing something, here, I hope somebody will reply to this review and set me straight.)The book, itself, is an INCREDIBLE collection of quotes and far surpasses the classic ""Bartlett's"" and has the potential to be a very useful tool or even just a fun read in itself.The ""bad"" part is that I wish there were links in the index to the various topics covered. Unfortunately, if you type in a search word...""beer"", for instance...you get back every quote where the word ""beer"" appears. For instance ""He was drinking a cold beer"".I would respectfully suggest that when the next edition is published for Kindle, it includes links from the alphabetical index to each subject listed rather than having the reader have to type in a search word and wade through a lot of non sequiturs to find an actual quote...which is EXTREMELY tedious!Otherwise, this is a fine book."
2,"Great quotes, if you find them on Kindle version","This excellent collection of quotations illustrates the need for much better Kindle and ebook searches. I found it difficult to find specific subject quotes and impossible to go to specific subject headings in the Kindle version. The material is not worth much, if one must struggle to access it."
3,An amusing tale by a WW-II fighter pilot,I enjoyed this tale of a young mans adventures in trying to get into the war and his exploits while there.
2,"Cute, but ""wobbly""","I really wanted to like these...looks-wise, they are very pretty shoes...but they just do not feel ""stable"" when you walk. They do not hold your feet in, and the ankle strap doesn't help much in that department either. So while they look great (I bought the ones with the green straps) they do not feel sturdy enough for me. I feel myself walking a little slower and more carefully, because I feel like I'm going to slip or turn my ankle. It would be a great sandal for just going out to dinner or to someone's house, but I wouldn't recommend wearing them to any function that involves more than just walking to and from your car! Also, I wish I had bought the darker ones because after wearing my lighter-colored soles a few times, they look dirty/stained...I've learned to always buy shoes with the darker fabric or leather footbed...!"
1,ribbon strap broke during second wearing,These shoes are cute and comfortable but they are so poorly made that the ribbon strap snapped the second time I wore them and that was it - the shoes are unfixable. Trash.
2,Cannot access photos on PC,"Neat gadget,too bad the software is incompatible with WIN XP.I tried everything I can think of to access the photos on my brand new top of the line Gateway 825GM Desktop to no avail,(and yes,I followed the instructions explicitly).I can however,view them on the tv,but have no way to ""save"" the pictures.I have emailed Barska tech support.......stay tuned."
1,"don't be scared, but also don't buy this",this dvd sucks. definitely no sex minus the girls...it's basically a b-grade jackass with maybe 2 or three funny things. the worst (in the sense of scaring you) thing on here is along the lines of poo poo type humor. i hope their next dvd is better. and that i'm in it.
2,Jackass - funny + lots of scrotum jokes=RTB,"The title basically summarizes what you are going to see on this DVD. If you love watching people getting peed on, scrotum=related humor, and lame pranks, then this the DVD for you.If you are AT ALL interested in the music/people/performance of FOB, I would highly suggest you steer clear of this DVD and instead purchase the HIGHLY SUPERIOR ""my heart will always be the b-side..."" instead.This DVD will appeal only to the most immature and scatalogical among us."
3,to the person who was afraid of losing respect for the band--,"I was too before I bought it... I watched it over the summer with my friend and we were both 14 then... I found it kind of funny but it's definately nothing compared to ""My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To my Toungue"", which is more serious but also has its funnier moments. ""Release the Bats"" is basically just Pete and his friends goofing off with, let's say, 'guest appearances' from the other members of fall out boy. it's basically jackass except with pete wentz. so there you go..."
3,"Nice book, good ideas, but often out of date...","I agree with another reviewer in that the book is not updated as much as it should be. A prime example: while browsing through the 2003 edition I noticed that the authors had a disconnect over the ""New York skyline"" in the atrium of the Luxor Hotel & Casino. This New York skyline, while rather a disconnect to many when Luxor first opened was redone in a Cairo theme years ago when NYNY Hotel opened up the Strip a bit! It's been several years, but it hasn't been updated. While obviously not a HUGE deal, it still is an example of the lack of attention to details I've noticed in this series."
5,Comprehensive and well researched,I loved the thorough ratings of hotels that made it very clear how each compared. I also got a great deal of help from the section on Blackjack strategy.
3,Fair-to-Good,"As an overview, the book is solid. However, the book does not supply enough detail on each hotel. The book states words to the effect that describing each lobby is redundant. I wanted to read detail about each lobby, each pool area, each casino and accommodations. I didn't get that in the Unofficial Guide."
3,The 2001 doesn't mean that it's really up to date,"I bought this book for a trip to Las Vegas in April, hoping to read comprehensive information on the Aladdin hotel, where I'll be staying. Since the book says ""2001"" right in the title, I assumed it would have full information on the hotel and shops and restaurant and casino that opened in 2000. Unfortunately, I was disappointed since it has only a brief paragraph with no specific information on any of the amenities, restaurants, etc. The book is otherwise helpful with basic information about Las Vegas, and information on restaurants in general is good, but no better than the information I already had from the Gayot book."
2,Too much (out of date) information,"Like other Unofficial Guides, this one tries to pack everything under the sun in a heavy paperback, and a lot of the information is already out of date. Frommer's and Fodor's are better because they give you the best. After all, you buy a book so you can save money and time, not to carry an outdated encyclopedia with you when you travel."
3,Comprehensive Information but uncritical,"This is a very complete guide book but the ""unoffical"" title is a little misleading. It surely is unoffical, but its also relentlessly bland and inoffensive.For example, the ""Imperial Palace"" hotel swimming pool is described as ""beautiful."" Most of us wouldn't expect to have a grey concrete parking garage right next door to a beautiful pool, right? Well the pool at the I.P. does, with no attempt to screen it from view.The information in the book is accurate, in that if it says ""casino X"" has a health club, or a pool, or whatever, you can be sure it will. But it looks as if the lawyers have removed any critical word about anything - use it as a guide to Las Vegas, but not as a gospel.A good companion book to carry along with this one is the ""Time Out Guide to Las Vegas"" which despite being British and rather pretentious in parts, doesn't pull its punches and offers a host of interesting and opinionated views on the city and its attractions."
4,Cool book but my dog still sucks!,"very cool book, but my dog is still a jerk! he walks around like he owns the place and poops all over my yard. makes me feed him daily and most of the time he leaves half the food in the bowl. hes a total wimp who cant stand the Southern California ""winter"" and can usually be found inside curled up next to the floor heater. maybe hes a case for the dog whisperer."
1,More jar than mushroom!,"This is described as a ""1-Pound jar of mushrooms"". Well opening the packaging I was surprised to see that the jar was half full. One huge jar literally half full of very small slices of very dark, very dusty mushrooms. I use dried mushrooms a few times a week and have bought them from many different sources, including from a street seller in China. I have bought dried mushrooms from other sellers on Amazon but I will never ever buy these from this seller again. ""Ultra AAA""? I don't think so!(I took a picture, but am unable to attach it. A pity.)"
1,t'aint what they say it is,"These mushrooms are presented as ""porcini"". These mushrooms had a very dark brown color unlike porcini. the taste was o.k.,not that of porcini.At the least I would say that the seller does not know his mushrooms, or he thinks that the buying public are completely ignorant. I would venture to say that mushrooms are Sillius Leutus not Porcini ( Boletus Edulis)."
4,"Wow, the first review of a wonderful band","I recently went to see these guys live with a bunch of other bands in detroit for a ""jade tree record label"" tour thing. I have to say that they are an amazing live band and that anyone should try and go see them. That being said, this album is really really good. It has a good blend of melody with edge and it does it flawlessly. The guitars are somewhat raw sounding which gives it a good edge. I'm very surprised no one has reviewed this record yet, so i figured this band deserves recognition."
4,This is a concepts video,"This is a good video for students - it covers basic terminology and concepts in pencil rendering, and each rendering method described is then demonstrated."
2,No Hedonism there,"I was hoping this would show the Hedonism II resort and the activities there. But it is nothing but a taping of girls dancing in bikinis, which could have been filmed in any country."
1,Disappointed,I was hopeful after reading some of these reviews that this would be a good product. Unfortunately the cushion completely flattens out and offers no support. My husband is 180 pounds and I am 135 and it didn't provide much cushion for either of us. I'll be trying one of the pricier seats and hope that I find better quality.
1,Can I rate it zero?,"Too thin, doesn't support at all. Good concept, though. But it's cheap foam and needs to be thicker. What is it made for kids under 130 pounds or what? It hurts my back, doesn't help it. The vinyl part makes me sweat, (bad material to sit on for long hours). I use a thick kitchen cushion with gripping on the other side, and get better results. If they made it thicker, with BETTER foam like memory foam or something and used better material, then I'd probably try it. But this is just cheap ""wedge"" foam, doesn't work well for me."
1,Ouch!,"I bought this to put on the chair we use when we sit at our home computer. Neither my wife nor I have back problems. My thought, however, was ""what could a little extra cushioning hurt?"". The answer is ""my back"". Maybe this provides relief if you have back pain or have had an injury. Our experience was that it forced us to sit in an unnatural way and thus CREATED back pain. Just like a lot of items, it really might depend on the individual as to whether it is helpful."
1,FLAT,"I have broken my tail bone several times and I have just recently had lower back surgery for a disc replacement.This pillow was to replace a spinal cushion I purchased from a medical supply center long ago. My other pillow lasted for years and gave relief many different times when it was needed.I had high hopes and was really excited to get this pillow. It has a promising description. But those promises were squished (pardon the pun) quickly. Within a month, it was about half as thick as it was when I received it! I'm not a heavy person, so I can't imagine how flat it would be for anyone over 130 lbs. Sitting on this cushion only is the same as not using it at this point.I've had to use this pillow with my old pillow to get any relief while looking for a new cushion. I've purchased a new one and will review it when it arrives."
2,"After 5 minutes, my back was in pain instead of the opposite","I didn't buy this because I had broken my coccyx, I bought it because I wanted a wedge-shaped cushion to help tilt my chair seat forward to improve my computer ergonomics. The wedge part did what I hoped, but the hole in the cushion makes your hips cave in and stresses your lower/mid back. Instead of sitting properly on your hip ""sitz bones"" (ischial tuberosities) the pressure is transferred to your soft tissue and spine.I'm neither big nor small; I'm about an average-size gal at 150 pounds. Maybe I'm not wide enough for this to work, but I went from no back pain to back pain in the 5 minutes I sat on it. Back to the store it goes."
5,orthopedic seat cushion,This is the best orhtopedic seat cusion I have purchased in many years and I have others that have minimal support. I'm only sorry I didn't buy two at the time but paying the extra postage to purchase another one deters me.
2,"Okay, at first...","It seemed to work at first, but after a few weeks of use, my back pain went back to it's pre-cushion level."
4,Helps With Posture,"I've been using this for a few weeks now and for the price, the construction is pretty decent. This has not compressed on me and I'm not exactly petite. What it does do though is improve my posture when I'm sitting at my desk and my back is no longer sore from sitting in the same (poor) position for hours on end. Also, my shoulders are less tight as it raises me up and back enough that I don't slouch forward.The other thing I have noticed is that my walking/standing posture has improved. I'm guessing that this product forces the core muscles to work a bit and the results are overall better posture.I'm pleased with this."
3,It's a basic coccyx relieving cushion.,"It's moderately comfortable and does relieve pressure on the coccyx if you are sitting with proper posture. Otherwise it's a bit hard. It's easily portable and the materials seem to be of sufficient quality to ensure that it doesn't fall apart right away. There's a ""slick"" side and a softer textured side which seems to be intended to be more of a non-slip surface. It's a basic cushion and one I use in chairs that I sit in less frequently. It would also work well in a car but those who drive for long periods of time or have more serious pain issues may want to consider an alternative."
2,Mediocre Product,"Sure it feels good at first, and you really notice a difference in your posture. But not long after using the product, it decompresses into a hard slab of cushion. When I was done using the chair where I placed the cushion, I thought it would spring back to its original thickness, at least overnight when no one was using it, but it never did. The cushion still stayed decompressed which now makes it uncomfortable. It hurts my butt and I wish I had never bought this cheap product. Oh and btw, I only weigh 120 lbs. so it isn't as if I put a lot of weight on the thing. I wouldn't recommend this at all. I think it a waste of money."
3,Good for the money!,"This cushion is very comforatable and well priced. One side is textured to keep it from moving around in your seat while the other is slick enough to not be hot but you don't slide either. The only problem I had with it was it made me sit to tall in my car, but my boyfriend with back problems actually beniffited from it in a long car ride. Worth it for a long trip."
5,It worked for me!,"I got this cushion two months ago due to the constant pain I was having on my tailbone. I sit in front of my computer 7 days a week, and the pain was interfering with my job. One week after I started using the cushion, I felt much better and now the pain is gone for the most part. I am buying a new one for my mom. I highly recommend this cushion for people experiencing tailbone pain. It is such a relief!"
2,Seat Cushion,Seat Solution Orthopedic Seat CushionWill not encourage purchase of this product. Made back issue worse. In the future will go through medical professional to obtain this type of product. Purchasing on the cheap failed on this item. Learned much.
4,It's good.,I always sit slouched over or in a C shaped form. recently I've been having back problems so I've been trying to sit straight but when I sit straight I sit directly on my tail bone cause I don't have any fat to comfort me...and it hurts! So I started using this and no more tail bone pain.Downers: I'm a man so my private parts get trapped in the back hole every now and again so I have to readjust myself to get them out and my butt becomes numb faster when sitting on the cushion so I have to get up every once in a while... although I should already be doing that haha.
3,Sciatic Relief,I am using this cushion. It raises parts of the body from an actual seat. I cannot unequivocably say that it has provided relief from my sciatic pain.
4,Pretty good,"I initially bought this item for use in the car. However, it was too wide to fit in the seat, so it did not work in my car (a toyota prius). However, it does fit into my office chair at home. I like it because it helps me sit up straight and provides support."
3,Using it more as a foot rest,"I bought this along with two other lumbar support products (not seat cushions like this one), and unfortunately it does not work together at all. I can either choose to use this product, or the other one, and quite frankly, the others is better.This cushion is nice and not too thick by itself, though for me, sitting on a wedge shape makes it feel as though I'll slide off it.As of right now, I'm using it as cushion for my make-shift foot rest until I can find something better."
4,Good Product,"Worked great! Mom uses it in the car, at church and at home it really helps her be more comfortable."
4,Works for me,"I always have to adjust this cushion in my chair at work, which can be frustrating because it won't stay put, but I haven't been experiencing any lower back pain lately (the whole reason I bought this)."
5,Chair cushion,I bought one to test out. Wonderful. I now have three. One for each car and one for at home. It was hard to sit. I lost a lot of weight and my tailbone feels like it it trying to stick through my skin when sitting in the car or at home. No problem anymore.Strongly support this product. Thought I would have to gain weight back to sit without pain.:)
4,great back support,Great value and helps immensely on long drives in the car with support for my herniated L4/L5. I would definitely recommend
4,My son is happy,"I bought this for my son after hearing that his hard plastic school chairs are so uncomfortable that the homeroom kids fight EVERY DAY for just one chair that is cushioned. I saw that chair on open house night and it was old and the cushion wasn't even very soft. That's just sad. Two other people had brought various orthopedic seat cushions to use, so I started looking for one. I couldn't believe some of the stratospheric prices out there. While I want my child to have a healthy back, we are not rich enough to blow $60 to $80 on a seat cushion. After EXTENSIVE research, I felt that this one would be the best bang for the buck. Is it? Well, my son is quite happy with it, says it makes all the difference in the world. Around $19 all inclusive for years of comfort and saving his young back? I say it's well worth it. The handle is especially useful and he was able to write his name on it using a silver sharpie."
2,No relief,"Have problems with sitting in bucket seats as I've become older. This cushion let me trade one pain for another. In short, didn't help much."
2,disapointing,"I wanted a soft cushion to sit on to alleviate the pain I get in my tailbone, and I ordered this one because it is supposed to be made of memory foam. It is very hard to sit on, and didn't really help. It also has a horrible factory smell. If I knew, I would have definitely ordered another one."
5,Instant Relief,"Receiving this cushion provided instant relief. Yes, really! If you've ever suffered from coccyx pain, you know how miserable it is. I was unable to sit, or go from sitting to standing without terrible pain. I made my own cushion and then purchased 2 different types from Amazon. This one was perfect and the best of all. A real ""aaaahhhh' moment. And after a week of use, my tailbone pain is subsiding. I worried the depth would be too low, but it is just fine, and the slope is perfect. It is larger than I expected: 13 1/2"" x 17"". It is black vinyl on one side and black suede or microfiber on the other to prevent slipping. The handle is useful. For me, the As Seen on TV Seat Solution is the solution."
1,Don't waste your money on this cushion,This cushionn has no support whatsoever and is really worthless. I would never buy this product again or recommend it to anyone.
2,Poor quality,"The product is not build for a people over 180lbs; I weight 183.5lbs, I seat for 3 hours daily in my seat solution, I have it for 2 weeks ONLY and the seat is already deformed and becoming flat.Luiz"
1,does not work for my,"I AM A TRUCK DRIVER AND THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK FOR ME, LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER.PAY MORE FOR A BETTER PRODUCT"
2,Flat as a pancake,"I bought this cushion awhile back and it's now flat as a pancake. It lasted about 2 months. I drive approximately 100 miles a day and it would lose it's firmness after about 15mins on the road. I won't buy another. In fact, I highly recommend a different product. Don't waste your hard earned money. Go buy the Vitalitywebb.com Tush Cush Car/Computer pad. It'll last a lot longer and works much better. A little more expensive but you get your money's worth."
3,It ONLY work for a little while,"I bought this product and it was great for the first few months.After awhile, the pad get's so compressed there is no support left.I guess the foam isn't the best quality as after awhile the height of the pad is diminished to almost nothing.I wish I bought something else.It was GREAT when it lasted. It's just too bad that the foam didn't stay. I am no essentially sitting on a pancake =(I'm going to buy something else.Hopefully this new product will last longer and not get flattened to nothing =("
1,Squishes all the way down,"I weight 120 lbs and have a relatively small rear. The cushion squishes down and after 30 minutes of sitting in it the first time, my tail bone hurts. The reason I got this was to prevent my tailbone from having pressure and hurting. Also, the hole in the middle is too large for my small bum and I seem to sink into the middle of it. Wish I could give glowing reviews like some of these long time customers, but unfortunately, I can't. Maybe you have to have certain rear dimensions for this to work properly!"
3,No Miracles - But it does help!,"I've had this cushion for several years now. I bought a new office chair about 18 months ago, but after several months, my tailbone just ached from sitting in it. I have this problem on anything I sit on for any period of time (floor, bleachers, etc., then my back hurts for days afterwards). I decided to pull the Seat Solution out of the closet. The bottom is vinyl, so it's slick, and I have to re-adjust everytime I get up and down or move around alot, and it isn't the softest seat I've ever set on, but it does stop the constant pressure on my tailbone that causes the backaches. It's the best thing I've found for my back. If I didn't have to adjust it constantly (I'm not good at sitting still at all!) I'd give it more than 3 stars!"
3,Orthopedic Seat Cushion,I was hoping to fill in the gap between the seat cushion and the seat back in my 2000 Ford 150 and the seat cushion did not accomplish that as I hoped. I do not need the cut-out for my tail bone and think I would benefit if the cut-out was not there. The service given by As Seen On TV Guys was great.3 starts for the product.....5 stars for them.
1,Completely useless,"But I love the 'handle' on the cardboard box that imitates what a real ortho cushion would have.This 'cushion' was so shabby I could squish it in my hand, and I'm arthritic.Dont waste your money.I gave it one star because it was the box graphics that sold me, so beware out there"
1,Dont spend the money,This is not supportive and horrible was not worth the money or timeAS SEEN ON TV SESMC6 Seat Solution Orthopedic Seat Cushion
2,Does not help with pregnancy tailbone pain!,I bought this hoping it would ease some of the pressure on my tailbone (as I am pregnant) and it doesn't change a thing. Needs to be much thicker and hole larger. I am going to have to try something else. Don't waste your money.
1,Seat Solution,"The piece smells so badly it is impossible to use. Smells like petroluem, even after leaving it out in the sun for days.Useless unless you have no sense of smell."
5,Works amazing!!,"I had a broken pelvis & tailbone 8 years ago and I can not sit longer then 25 minutes without shooting pains through my legs, pelvis and back.I got a job 5 months ago where I have to sit all day and this seat is my life saver! I am able to sit for hours and not have the pains I had :)"
1,No Relief For Me!,"At first this cushion seemed to do the job, but after a few weeks the cushion bottomed out flat. It does not retain its' shape. I weigh 180, so I think I may do better with a thicker cushion with less give. And now my tailbone still hurts. The sellers here are great but this product just didn't do it for me. I guess I'll keep shopping for that right one."
2,NOT FIRM - Misleading Illustration,"The illustration shows how a person is being uplifted with this cushion - If someone of 170lbs weight sits in it - this sinks and it becomes useless - My solution of using a sofa cushion was better because it was more firm and I didn't have to buy another thing. I figured this would be more compact, neat and firm - so if you need tailbone relief there maybe some purpose - else - its useless."
1,as seen on tv seat cushion,I purchased this product for myself as I have back problems. The cushion is not firm enough. We just drove 1040 miles to Florida and the cushion does not give good support for the back.
3,just ok,This cushion is just OK. I have been experiencing tailbone pain due to my pregnancy and I needed some relief. The cushion does help some but I still experience pain after sitting in my office chair (or airplane seat) for awhile. It would probably help if the cushion held its shape a little better.
2,Doesn't Work As Well As I Had Hoped,"I have a damaged disk in my lower back and have problems sitting for long periods of time. So I bought this cushion for my desk at work. I never really got to see the result it would have on my back because it set me up so high in my chair that my legs wouldn't fit under my desk. So I thought I would try it in my SUV instead because driving is always uncomfortable for my back. Same thing--it set me up so high that my head was nearly touching the roof of the vehicle. So, it seemed like a good idea, but didn't work for the 2 uses I had in mind."
2,Does not work after 2 weeks,I was 140lbs when using this seat solution and it flattened after 2 weeks. I've already put it away as it is not useful any more.
5,Seat Cushion,I have a complex tear of the labrum in my hip and will need surgery. This cushion has made my life bearable until then. Sitting was extremely painful until I got this cushion. I ordered two more to have in my car and at my computer. I LOVE them!
5,Perfect addition to college dorm,"I bought this cushion, after having some back problems. i sit at my desk a lot. frankly, my wooden chair really stinks. this cushion makes it a lot more bearable to do long stretches of work at my laptop. i can only recommend it, if you find yourself in a similar situation."
3,Too big for my butt,"This seat cushion is too big for my small butt. It is better than it was sitting on that hard chair at work, but it is thinner on the front than the back. The front flattens out quickly. I tend to slouch forward a bit and this cushion is more meant to sit back, straight position. It could be good in the car for those long trips though.I used to get numbed legs before but now this cushion seams to help. I also saw this at the As Seen on TV store for $12. Could have saved me shipping. I will know next time."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I hate to say it but I'm really disappointed with this product. I had a great need for a seat cushion for my work. I work 12 hour shifts at a desk job as a network engineer and rarely take breaks. My rear-end really hurts by the end of my shift! I've looked around and have come to the conclusion that you either pay $15 or $45 and up. Since my work won't reimburse me I wanted something cheap.This is a situation where you get what you pay for.At first glance this cushion feels nice. However, it gets uncomfortable within about an hour of sitting. My guess is the interior of this is made of a low quality everyday foam. There's little resistance and after sitting on it for a short amount of time it looks like a pancake. I suggest saving money for something else. What else you ask? I'm not sure, I'm trying to find something better myself, but pass on this for sure. Don't be fooled by the great price tag. You will not be happy with this product."
2,Not great.,Too flat to offer much comfort if you need it for a coccyx problem.Doesn't help me at all.
4,So good - other retailers abuse the price point,"Yes, this product works and feels great. It is full of actual support. The combination of soft side and water resistant sides make perfect sense for the comfort factor. I have noticed that this product gets ""price gouged"" by many other retail sites and I can feel why. It is a simple and amazing design that is often imitated however the foam and the covering are well made and expertly stitched. I highly recommend you purchase this original brand."
3,"It's not bad, but...","The first day I got it, I was amazed. very comfortable for my tail-bone/coccyx pain & giving me good sitting posture & all that. I was very happy & excited. I am using this at my work chair (at work of course). But in few days, started seeing it getting compressed a little and not as comfortable as in beginning, just in 2 weeks (So much for the furniture grade foam or something like that). Then I used it on my recent BUS travel, it was definitely helpful than not having one. I was more comfortable, not as painful. But had to keep adjusting my seating and it seems to get inflated/compressed after long sitting. Then it doesn't feels as comfortable as it was supposed to. But better than not having anything..."
4,not bad,this item works some how hovever it is not a ortopedic product long time use can cause some pain on your leg depends on your leg position but it works for tail bone problem not great but giving more time to sit on chair
1,not really work and delivery late,It took about 2 weeks to get this product after placing order. The cusion is not really work for my back pain.
1,does nothing to me whatsoever,need to be a lot thicker and the cutout for the tailbone a lot bigger and the sloping design is nonsense.mine is in the dumpsite somewhere in los angeles.
4,"Great, but a little pricey.","Well, this is not a truffle paste or a truffle tapenade. This is a mixture of Champignon mushrooms, black olives, black truffles, olive oil, spices as mentioned on the items description. So, I think it is too pricey!That said it tastes wonderful and I would buy it again and again. :)Truffles are very flavorful and fragranced mushrooms for those of you wondering, so if you don't like mushrooms I am pretty sure you won't like truffles.I add this tapenade to my cooking (from meals to eggs), and I like to make a small sandwich sometimes, which my husband and I share. If we don't spoil ourselves now, when will we? ;)I recommend this item."
4,Really makes a difference!,"I was skeptical that a wine glass could make such a difference in how a wine tastes, but after attending a demonstration sponsored by Riedel and a Napa Valley winery (Trefthen Family Vineyards) I became a true believer.My only reservation that prevents me from giving a 5 star rating is the price. I've been told that other companys offer similar glasses but a mouch lower price (25% to 50% of the cost of a Riedel glass)."
5,Funny Potty Humor,I found this in my parents room when I was a kid. Some of the humor was pretty funny... I still have to book and it is sitting in my downstairs bathroom! LOL
1,Not as advertised,"Ordered this item. Received MBC-15S, no antenna coupler. Sent order back and was sent another MBC-15S, wrong item again. Returned it once again. Now told problem is widespread and will not send another item. Also, they have no idea if the right item will ever be in stock. Think they just blew it and advertised the wrong product at the low price. Bet they won't ever offer this item as described foe $14.99. Maybe they should just fess up that they screwed up."
2,Never again JVC,"I've owned this head unit since 2006, today, 2/22/2013 I swapped out for a new head unit. I've had these problems since day 1, I even got a replacement for the CD player skipping problem from bestbuy.Pros:USBMP3 supportSub control/out with great results!Wide display, not super wide but very nice.Cons:No ability to pause mp3sIf listening to hour long + podcasts the search function is almost meaninglessno auxno L/R insno shuffle buttonCannot handle a decent sized library on a usb driveUSB charges enough to keep your devices from shutting down, no more.. no less.CD player skips at times (more than most)Randomly shoots back to Demo modeclumsy controlsThis head unit is far below par. I also owned a renowned JVC sub and amp (I cannot remember the names, I got rid of them a long time ago..) Nothing but troubles from JVC. It seems others have had better luck but JVC has lost a customer for life."
5,Excellent book by a professional writer,I am diappointed by Amazon to allow reviews that critize a writer with reference to books that are not even in the same catagory. This is an easy to read book that is not made up by the editor but are by world renown persons. It is a great gift book by a very talented writer. Apparently the negative critic is full of chicken soup.
