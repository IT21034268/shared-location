1,Absurd,"Years ago, when I read this, I wrote a very, very lengthy review and posted it here on Amazon. It was never put up, because the Amazon moderators didn't approve; it was too mean, they said.That killed my desire to write a review for this and for books in general, although I'm trying to do so now that it's a few years later.I'm not going to bother writing up a lengthy review again. I'm just going to say this book came across as very, very juvenile and hilariously absurd. One of the highlights is ***spoiler*** Ender's brother and sister changing the world via the internet. I guess Card didn't predict how every argument on the internet ends with people calling each other trolls.Regardless, while I'm not going to make another lengthy review, it does bother me that such a bad book can get such good ratings by others. Thus, I'm trying to temper the enthusiasm with my honest rating."
1,Puerile & Dull,I really expected this book to hold a lot of merit as everyone I know has praised it as being a classic must-read work of elevated science fiction. It's really just about the dullest novel I've ever had to endure. Don't believe the hype. This book was juvenile and bland in both content and execution.
3,Ender's Game,"Interesting to envision a time when the fate of the world lies in the hands of children. This story moved along well despite missing background on the inner workings of the government, the lack of which left some parts of the book confusing. I would also have liked more character development. Good read overall."
4,Ender's Game,"Not a big science fiction fan, but this book was chosen by our book club. I really enjoyed it--well written, not so far out there you couldn't comprehend what was going on, but definitely sy phy. The characters were believable and tied you into the story."
5,Great,Five stars. Can't wait to read the sequels. Kept my nose in the book for many hours at a time.
4,I have to say this book is FANTASTIC,"Ender's Game is the story of a child who is rocked by an untolerating society, manipulative military, an abusive brother, and distant parents. Without his knowledge, Ender is manipulated by the military in a future society to annihiliate an entire race of beings. This book is strongly written, grips the reader's emotions, and plunges them into the a young boy's chaotic life. Definately adult reading material, though not due to any sexual adult content"
5,"This is a great book, which hooked me on Card.","This was the first book I read of Orson Scott Card's. I first read it in the sixth grade(I'm 14), and I loved it. I forgot about it until last year when I saw the book again. I found all the sequels to it including the recent ""Children of the Mind"". I even read the ""Earthfall"" Series and his ""Alvin Maker"" series. You have got to read this book. The psychology/action theme makes this a great page turner"
5,Ender's Game,"WOW, this is an exciting story and has inspired me to be a better leader in my job! I look forward to reading more from Card."
5,One of the best novels I've ever read,"This novel truly shows that a true classic will always be compelling. Science fiction is truly one of the most interesting novels you can read. Ender's Game is quite the page turner. I found myself blown away by the story, I was cheering for the hero the entire time and every emotion he went through, I felt like a piece of me was too."
4,solid book,I read this book on a reccomendation from a friend and was not dissapointed. A solid science fiction tale following a gifted student picked to go to a interstellar battle school. Excellent on all accounts.
4,Ender's game,"I read this after reading The Lost Gate. I liked Lost Gate better, and I can't wait for the following books to come out. However, I liked Ender's Game alot and I'm excited to continue reading the series."
5,Changing the way you look at children.,"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is one of those few novels that changes the way you look at the world. By watching the emergence and transformation of Ender Wiggins, you understand the power and vulerability of the youngest amoung us - the children. Orson Scott Card has captured in an eminently readable and timeless masterpiece the thrill - and danger - of being a child in a very adult world."
5,What a great book!!!,"I really enjoyed this book! It's head and shoulders above everything, but The Hobbit and The Lord of the Ring trilogy. Ender's Game snatched my attention from page one and really played with my emotions until the final page. Definitely a must-read.-Cam Berry"
3,"Good book, but over-hyped.","I read this book with high expectations, and honestly, I was underwhelmed. It is so highly revered on so many sci-fi book lists and is a literary fan favorite, but I just don't see what the big fuss is about. It is a good story, it's got a good pace and interesting characters, it even grapples with some heavy themes including war, childhood, xenophobia, propaganda and the loss of innocence, but I never once, while reading it, had the sense that this was a work on the level of other great works of fiction that I've read. An enjoyable read, and I would recommend it, but it does not belong to a special class."
5,THIS IS THE BEST!,"This is definetly the best book I have ever read. I want to read it again and again! Ender has to face many challenges and the men purposly put him up to these challenges to see how tough he is so that he can fight in the war with the ""buggers"", an alien race that is threatening human kind. I have read the second one, Speaker For the Dead, and am currently reading Xenocide, the third one. Orson Scott Card is definatly the best author and I love his work and am inspired by him. You will have to read this book!!"
5,Amazing Adventure,"I'm not a huge science fiction fan, but I was hooked by Ender's Game right away. Card managed to suspend any disbelief on my part that kids Ender's age could carry out such courageous and calculated acts by reminding us that Ender really was human, and a child at that. Ender just wanted friends, people he could trust, rely on, and love. Instead, his personal well-being (and sanity!) was sacrificed for the military objectives of human kind. It's a tragedy that a big-hearted kid like Ender is turned into a killing machine, but it's a joy to read his triumphs and finally his ability to start a somewhat normal life in the end.Kids saving the human race, kids ruling the planet ... as fantastic as it may seem, and is, it made for a compelling story. Five out of five stars."
5,A true original.,This book is a sheer joy from start to finish. In fact all his Ender series are difficult to put down. This is an original concept that is well written. A true classic. Every adult and every student I've recommended this book to has loved it.
3,What it's really about,"It's simple. The core of Ender's Game is bullying and revenge for bullying. The book worksfor exactly the same reason that Hemingway's short stories work: righteous indignation, thefeeling that in a just world things would be more fair. In Ender's case, he prevails; inHemingway, much more of a realist, the injustice prevails and the sense of outrage persists.The same theme exists in Bernard Cornwell's series on Richard Sharpe. Sharpe fights theFrench or the Tippoo Sultan, but his real fight is always against some dog in the manger, someevil coward, some bully, who is jealous of his success and courage and resourcefulness. It isthe same with Ender, but with no realism at all. But it still works as a story formula."
2,"promised well, but completely disapponting","I can't see why authors like this can't manage to finish writing a book in a satisfying way. Why do they rush? Why can't they avoid telling too much, too many years in 2-3 pages trying to justify a non-sense final?Despite all the war-oriented plot (srsly, should I buy the cold-war revival?) the book could even gain 3 stars, but once again, the ending is horrible. Completely disappointing.Sorry, the author won't get another penny from me."
5,Addicting!,I read this book in 40 hours. I totally read it with no reserve. I couldn't put it down. There was absolutely no way. Read this. It was excellent. Card's character's really leave you knowing them and you could place them somewhere. I really reccomend this book. READ IT!
5,Not what I expected - Thoughtful and Deep,"A friend loaned me this book, and it sat on my shelf for months. ""Just some book about some kid who outsmarts adults, not like I haven't heard that lame plot before,"" I thought.I was completely wrong. This is an astonishing piece of science fiction, political maneuvering, military theory, and most of all, human nature.You can read the plot summaries elsewhere. I think it compares favorably with Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"", although the approach is completely different. What I liked about the book was how it manipulated me, the reader, into believing certain things that, in the end, weren't true at all. Fascinating exposition, tense unwinding, and just enough character development of the supporting cast to keep it believable."
5,My ALL-TIME Favorite Book!,"I read Ender's Game in about 2 sittings, and then I read it again in one. This book has the best plot of books I have ever read. The problem I found with some of Card's books are that you either love it or you comepletely hate it. So that's why the stars seem unbalanced."
5,Ender's Game,"The breadth of Card's knowledge in the areas of geopolitics, education, game theory, religion, psychology and story telling is very impressive. This is no mere ""science fiction"" work, but a novel that can take its place with any of the best fiction now being written. I'm especially impressed by the ease with which he combines these difficult subtexts with entertaining character, dialogue and plot. He creates a unique and entirely convincing view of the future on an epic scale. In addition, those who enjoy allegories will find much to meditate upon."
5,Ender's Game,"This book is without a doubt a great read. Card tells the life of an amazing young boy living in a time where the world is at war with another species. Ender, genius of the geniuses, finds himself suddenly confronted with an option to stay or leave his home, family, and planet and battle the alien species which threatens the future of Earth. Little did he know what he was actually getting into..This story keeps its action and surprises you after every page throughout the entire book, never slowing down, and never getting boring. Once you pick it up, you'll only put it down if your house is on fire! You will care for Ender, feel his pain, cry for him, fear for him, and much more. This story literally takes you into the life of this fragile character."
5,I Love This World - As messed up as it is...,"I love a world where people are tested young for vocations and set on the right path and this books takes it to a delicious extreme (something Orson Scott Card does very well - so does Isaac Asimov). This book almost took me to where Anne McCaffrey did in Dragonsong and the Rowan. If you mixed the two into a cynical mind, you'd get this story. While Anne McCaffrey is a hopeful author, Orson Scott Card wants to take us to the edges of humanity's willingness to exploit talent it would normally not even recognize.That said, I love this book. I love that edge and the writing draws you in without drawing attention to itself the way some authors do. It is an insight to the thinking of a truly exceptional intelligent mind. Thank you Orson Scott Card."
4,Solid Sci-Fi Book,"I don't read a lot of science-fiction material. Besides this, I've ""A Clockwork Orange"", and some Kurt Vonnegut. But, this was a terrific read. I loved this book. I reccomend it highly to anyone who hasn't read sci-fi before. It's really easy to read and not too technical at all."
5,Exceptional Science Fiction,"I used to be an avid science fiction book reader, but it eventually all seemed pretty boilerplate and repetetive, so I stopped. Ender's Game was a surprisingly good and new welcome back to science fiction. I'd recommend it to anyone normally wary of science fiction."
4,great (most of the time),"The story itself was a great read, although I think it would have been much better without the religious overtones that crept in relentlessly as you near the end of the book.Also, I suggest that you do NOT read the back cover of this or any other Ender book prior to reading it. Twice I found that it contained a spoiler (which was very irritating to me)."
5,The best Sci-Fi Book I ever read!!!,"Ender's Game is a fast paced, high speed novel. The charactors are fresh and exciting. I have always said that people underestimate the power that kids have. Card took a group of kids and turned them into heros. I have always been one for the underdog, so the charactor of Ender was perfect. his struggles were real and his attitude riviting. My imaginantion ran wild and I suddenly found myself right there at Battle School in the midst if training! I would recomend this book to all ages, and don't wory if you don't think you are a Sci-Fi fan, from the first page you will be hooked. There are also 3 other books in the series, so make sure you check them out. Also don't forget the Ender's Shadow series (4 Books) that introduces the charactor of Bean. Both series are eaqually exciting and leaves you wanting more. I heard there was going to be a movie made and can't wait to see it!"
4,a great novel but hard to understand at a younger age,enders game is one of the best sci fi books of all time. well at least thats what everyone says. i had to read this over the summer for my english class. when i returned to school in the fall all of my clssmates said they hated it because it was strange ad confusing. the plot overall is amazing and all of the details are outstanding but i just have to reccomend it to people over maybe 12 or 13 years old.
4,Creative. Riveting. Moving.,"Ender's Game is an essential read for any fiction fan, whether you are into sci-fi or not. I was forced to give it a 4/5 because of the strange, unthreaded piece at the end. In fact, this book could have ended several times before that, without consequence to the preceding pages.Nonetheless, an excellent read. Wonderful."
4,Riveting,There were a lot of great twists and turns in this story.. some parts were a bit long but there was always a pick-up where the story grabbed you and drew you back in.
5,Game's Review,"Ender's Game was an excellent book! Orson Scott Card goes to distant measures and makes a master-mind type of a book. Six year old Andrew Wiggin (also known as Ender given to him by his sister Valentine) is a mastermind genius among genius. He goes to Battle School to be trained to control Earth's fleet against the alien creature ""Buggers"" who have already attacked earth twice devastating the human race....the book was an excellent book written with creativity, Orson did an excellent job!!"
5,\WoW/,"This book absolutely blew me away. The sheer brilliance of the novel was astounding. It took you to another dimension; one where human beings and buggers are rivals and pressure to save humanity lies solely on Ender's shoulders. The tests Ender goes through were extremely hard, both mentally and physically. You'd think he'd break, but it was Ender's strength and endurance that kept him going. The imagination that went into a work like this is astonishing. Overall, I regard this book as a masterpiece. I commend Card for his work."
5,Great characters,Really love all of the characters in Orson Scott Crards books. Enjoyed this series especially. Read all of the books in the series.
5,"A ""READING MAGNET""","THIS STORY, FIRST AS A SHORT STORY AND LATER AS A NOVEL, DREW MY TEEN AGE SON INTO THE WORLD OF READING. I HAVE COLLECTED MR. CARD'S WRITING FOR YEARS (STARTING, OF COURSE, WITH ""ENDER'S GAME),"" AND WAS DELIGHTED WHEN MY SON DISCOVERED THIS GREAT AUTHOR. AS MY SON NEARS THE AGE OF 30 HE STILL CONSIDERS ""ENDER'S GAME"" TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS HE HAS EVER READ (AND THE BOOK HOLDS A PLACE AT THE TOP OF MY LIST). THE BOOK SHOULD BE IN EVERY UPPER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY. IT WILL DRAW CHILDREN LIKE A MAGNET INTO THE WORLD OF GOOD LITERATURE"
5,Awesome read!,"I am not typically a science fiction fan, but this was a gripping read. If you are looking for books that will help your kids develop a social consciousness, this is a great book!"
4,Enders Game,"Excellent lesson on learning to strategize, well disguised in an adventure story. Should be a must-read for gamers, especially war-gamers."
3,I finally read Ender's Game,"Ender's Game is a book I've always heard about but never got around to reading. Well I finally have. It's well written, the story is engaging. It's clearly meant as a young adult book. I think if someone were looking for a book for a preteen boy this would be a really good pick."
4,"Excellent, but parts being dull","My name is ""Cook"" and im in the7th grade. For Ender's Game... I thought it was in a cool setting and had excellent characters, though parts of it were like being slowly pecked to death by a duck. The reason for this is that parts of it had no action whatsoever and was mindless babble. I thought Ender was a creative child but at the same time being weak in the beginning."
4,It was an OK book,"I am a 7th grader at Desert Ridge Middle School. I though that it was so so book. I think the best parts are when Ender's in battle school. However it is pretty violent. There are parts where Edner kicks people to death. while Ende'rs at battle school Graff turns Ender into a sick, dispersed, psychotic child. It's a good book"
4,Worth Reading,"This typical sci-fi, fantasy novel by Card has unique qualities that only this book has; however, those qualities are sometimes negative. Ender's Game tells a story just through dialogue between supporting characters; the events support the conversations. As much as it is unique and interesting, the words are hard to understand, as the vocabulary is not exactly orthodox.The plot of the story is well-balanced; every event is reasonable. This story ends with a slight twist, as Ender Wiggin finds out what he really is doing."
1,Hated it,"I know everyone seems to love this book, but I hated it! It isn't ""science"" fiction (like A.C. Clark books), but fiction. I could not suspend my belief THAT much to appreciate what the pre-pubescent main character could do. Perhaps I'm too old (30?). I think this book appeals to pre-high school kids, but it did nothing for me."
1,The Most Overrated Science Fiction Book Ever?,"The most intriguing thing about Ender's Game is trying tofigure out why it receives raves. The backboneof the plot can be explained in a sentence and while itmight have supported a short story (the resolutionof the story is predictable half way through)it's too flimsy a frame for a novel. Theno-gray-zone series of leadership-lesson episodes read like Card wrote a story to thetable of contents in a US Army basic trainingmanual. My only explanation for the book's popularity isthat it hit a sweet spot of readers with their hands onthe joystick,hungry for a rationalizationfantasy for the hours and quarters that theysquander in video game parlors masteringMissile Command."
1,Horrible .... why does this get such good reviews?,"If you are under 15 years of age, you might enjoy this story. But for anyone over 15, move on ... this is just juvenile. The nature of the interactions, the dialog, the story. It was so bad I didn't get past page 100 and I can't bring myself to attempt another Card book."
5,great book,great book. i love it on my kindle. great story and a very quick read. perfect way to spend a rainy day.
3,Good book for teenagers,"I would have enjoyed this book better if I'd read it in my teens.I found the story quite simple, even boring at times, but kept reading beacuse this book is such a classic. Was pleasantly surprised with the spin at the end, which's what made the book worth the reading.I'd recommend if you want to know the classics of SF, or if you just want the casual read."
5,My favorite book of all time........,"Personally, I loved this book, but I think that there is nothing wrong with disliking it. However, it seems that many of the reviewers giving Ender's Game a 3 or lower are only trying to be cool, and to show how much better they are than the rest of us shmucks who really took something away from this book. Something would be wrong if everyone loved this book, but please, dont insult us with your overly harsh criticisms."
5,"""Ender's Game"" worthy of praise","It's hard to imagine another six-year-old, in fact or fiction, with as much to worry about as Ender Wiggin. One day, he's dealing with worldly bullies. The next, he's preparing to deal with the alien variety.Where Orson Scott Card delivers the goods in ""Ender's Game"" is creating a believable setting and an extraordinary but believable character. Adding depth and realism to it all are the men responsible for training Ender and his force for the ultimate showdown with their attackers.The suspense kept me turning through the last page. To be sure, ""Ender's Game"" is a must-have on any serious science-fiction reader's bookshelf."
5,Amazing writing and an amazing read!,"Ender's Game was my first sci-fi novel and remains my favorite to this day. The writing style is vivid enough to fully comprehend what is happening but vague enough to allow the reader to use his own imagination (as the author himself states). There has never been a fictitious character I have cared more for after reading a book than Andrew Wiggin. He represents so much in the human spirit. The primal instinct, the compassionate heart, the deep seated moral dichotomy between doing what one knows is right and wrong, and the ability to comprehend and accept consequences to ones action. There's a lot more here than just an action story about boys with laser guns in zero-gravity cubes and it is something every literate human should experience."
4,A bit hard to believe,"I have kids, so this was a bit unrealistic for me. It's hard to believe 6 year olds, even ones that are geniuses, would have the kinds of thought processes these kids did. And I'm not super into military tactics, so I had a hard time with all of that. But I do enjoy and applaud creativity, and that abounds in this story. I didn't know there was a movie being made about it until I had finished the book. I think they will probably have to change a ton to make it fit the screen, but I will be looking forward to it anyway."
2,Not entirely fun and games.,"Ender's Game is not just about games and strategy, and it is not good clean fun for young readers. This book includes violent scenes of a child killing other children, twice, and also includes one graphic sexual moment. If you are raising your children to be caring and sensitive, stay away from this book. It was somewhat entertaining for an adult, with an interesting plot, but shallow and unbelievable characters, sub-plots so outlandish as to be insulting, a ridiculous foe in the ""buggers"" and literally no satisfying ending. I'm sure it will make a blockbuster movie."
3,Sci Fi Fans Needed,"OK - I read this one on the recommendation of a sci-fi/fantasy fanatic, which I am not. I thought it was an OK read, but I found the violence really disturbing. Normally that is something I can get past, but not this time. I think sci-fi fans would love this novel for various reasons, but if that is not you, be careful."
5,I liked this book so much....,-I ran to the store and bought it.-Read it more than twenty times.-Collected the whole series.
2,Ender's game,Seems legitIt was a good book to read I even would read it without reading it in English classI am probably going to read the rest of the series
5,Hands Down the best book I've ever read!,"I had heard that Ender's Game was a kids book from a lot of people, so I had reservations about it until I read it. I'm glad I didn't read it when I was a kid because there are a lot of themes and subtleties that I doubt even some adults would understand. Irregardless read this book, you wont regret it!"
3,"Missing the point, perhaps?","I believe Card made the book ""simple"" so his message could reach a larger audience. I think he's saying our beliefs have to be knowledgeable about the world than reflect the best in the world back on itself. However when the job of bringing out the world's best nature is placed on the shoulders of one child, it crushes his spirit.Also I don't personally believe in Mormonism, but if all good/smart people could become Card's for their side there'd be hope. That's not elitist because the average people would still be the doers, because dreamers without doers are impotent.In least that's what I got out of it."
5,Thought Provoking,"Ender's Game is a book about Ender Wiggin, a child genius and how he ""saved"" the planet. In the future, there are three main cultures: American, Russian, and the buggers. America and Russia are both ruled by the government. The only thing keeping them at peace are the buggers and the Warsaw Pact, a peace treaty. The buggers are insectoid aliens complete with pupae, queens and hives. Back on Earth, you are only allowed to have two children. Yet Ender, a third, is born. The government only let him live because his siblings showed ""promise"". Ender later destroys the buggers, but is that a good thing? This book is for all ages, even though it has some curse words. I strongly reccomend this book."
1,What's this about?,"God almighty, I had to read this fantasy scifi book for a book club, and I'm lucky I didn't strangle myself. To start, fantasy isn't my cup of tea, but I decided to give it a chance. Afterall, I'm a proponent of the ""no contempt prior to investigation"" movement. Halfway through, I realized I had no idea what the hell this thing was trying to tell me. Some six year old kid freezing computer bodies while adults explain to him in adult terms the reason he's so important. Wait a minute! Unless a hundred years from now preteens are a thousand times brighter than their counterparts today, no way this kid is going to understand anything the guy tells him. Hell, I didn't understand what the guy was talking about. It was excruciatingly painful from beginning to end. Frustrated, I called a friend in the club and she said ""hang on to the end, there's a real surprise."" So, good soldier that I am, I did. But I didn't find the surprise (...). Couldn't stand this read. Dreadful!!!!!"
1,One Simple Twist Does Not A Novel Make,"This book could have been written as a short story ... by a thirteen year old.It could be retitled ""Recess goes to Space"".How anyone could rate this little-boy-saves-the-day story alongside the greats of SF is utterly beyond me.This book was lent to me by someone who simply couldn't wait to see what I thought of the twist in the tale. I won't repeat the conversation we had after I finished.Thank God I didn't spend money on this simplistic, trivial, waste of paper."
5,Phenomenal book,Any fan of writing in general should read this book. The plot/characters/writing are all superb; I generally avoid science fiction but this story and the characters involved are so captivating that I found myself reading the follow up books as well.
5,Better than I expected,"Ender's Game is not a book I would generally read but the reviews made it tempting. Boy, was I pleased! Recommended!"
2,For children,"I was expecting a classic, but I found a very weak book. A children's must read, surely. The audiobook version is good."
5,Upset by the Confusion but Love the Product,"I'm really not quite sure what the 'Ender Quartet' in this product title is all about, I was expecting the 4 books related to the ender series but instead only received the first book. The book is beautiful. Awesome gift. If I had known that this product was only the single book I would not have rushed the shipping, $50 on the single book wasn't so hot."
5,Great Book,I read and then re-read this book with my girlfriend who doesn't read science fiction. This is definitely a classic in the genre.
4,True Sci-Fi,"As good as its reputation promised, and an excellent representation of classic science fiction (as opposed to Space Fantasy). My only disappointment is that the later books fail to recapture the initial promise of this book..."
2,Ender's Game,"I have to say I didn't like this book as much as I had hoped. I know that this greatly puts me in the minority as almost everyone I mentioned I was reading this book to just LOVES it, but I guess it went over my head a bit. It's Science Fiction to the extreme (which is not a bad thing) but I found it difficult to fully follow what was happening and so the ending was a bit anti-climatic for me. In that it's such a classic though I think it's worth reading for one to form their own opinion on it -- who knows you may love it."
5,Great!,I am so happy I recently learned of this book and the series. I hope the movie doesn't gloss over the complex issues in the book.
2,Young adult readers only,This book is great for young adults. If you are an adult that has read great literature this book will seem childish. I was underwhelmed as I usually am reading science fiction. The best adult SiFi book is Fahrenheit 451.It is dark and intelligent.
3,Very good book but the ending,"I liked the book a lot, until I got to the end. The whole story was gripping, there were a few things I did not like at all. The way he ends the book was very weak. At one point after the major battle he should have concluded the book, then he should have started another book from that point on. In my opinion, I think that Orson could have done a lot better, but he gets these weird ideas and thinks he must put them in so that they'll help his story. Unfortunately, some of these ideas ruin the experience for the reader."
5,Great start to the Ender series!!,"This was a great start to the Ender series. It was the first of Card's work that I read. After reading that I was hooked. The plot is gripping and never stops. All of the characters were devloped very well, and it sets the reader up for Speaker and Xenocide."
5,This book will chage your view of life.,it's impossible to describe the magnificent wrting style and storyline presented in Enders Game. But i can assure you one thing. it will change your life. i began reading the book and stayed up until three am reading everynight until i finished it. it is a powerful writing that will still be atracting readers of every age for milennia to come.
5,Awsome!,"This book was very well written. It keeps you hooked from the beggining by giving you enough information to make you curious, but not enough for you to figure out what's happening. The ending is a huge shock, that leaves you dazed and wondering like young Ender how it could have happened. I recomend it to anyone of any age, because it is easy to follow, but interesting, and the older you are, the more you get out of it, so even adults enjoy it."
5,Ender's ability to read people's motives was exciting!,"Ender's Game is about a child genius who goes through tough training to save the world. Each character's contribution made this book interesting and fun. Each person Ender encountered presented a challenge, hindrance, or help to the moral strength of Ender. A must read!"
5,Simply magical...,"This is the only book that I've read many times, and keep coming back for more... Every time I read it I see something new in it and myself... Simply spectacular..."
3,Product title is misleading,"The book was great but I thought I was buying the ""Ender Quintet"". I was unhappy to find that I only purchased a single book that was a member of the quintet."
3,Don't be foole by all the stars . . .,"This book has consistently received high praise. Too much in my opinion. Its ok, but not great. The thing that I think bothered me about it was that the main characters were children (super genetically enhanced children, but children nonetheless). These kids are put in charge of fighting a galactic war for the planet because they are smarter than everyone else. That just never struck me as plausible and bothered me throughout the book. Kids will never be put in charge of defending our planet from galactic invaders I don't care how clever they are. Maybe other readers are ok with that, because it makes for an interesting story. But, I have to have a lot of realism and plausibility in my sci-fi or it doesn't work for me."
4,A Sci-Fi Work of Art,"Orson Scott Card thrills readers in his first installment of the Ender series. It tells the story of Ender's rise to power at Battle School leading up to the ultimate showdown between the humans and the buggers. I thought it was a very interesting book with a plot and storyline that keeps your interest. I advise any lover of science fiction and fantasy is sure to love Ender's Game, as well as the entire Ender series."
4,Stimulator for the Brain Dead,"At the request of a friend I purchased and read this book. Ender Wiggin is a great character that most people (who don't stare and drool while watching the cartoon network) can relate to in some way or another. I enjoyed it's ""childish"" point of view."
4,"It was the stuff of mythologies, of urban legend, of scripture.","Wow...I was not expecting that ending. It was the stuff of mythologies, of urban legend, of scripture. Ender crawled into my heart and I bled for him, I cried for him, I will never forget him. At first I was utterly disturbed by the child abuse, but I couldn't put the book down. So, why the 4 stars instead of 5? Probably my fault. There were parts of this book that just went over my head, parts I didn't get. Like Anderson? Graff made an impression, but I didn't understand Anderson's role? The structure is so different than what we get fed through today's literature. The subplots and how they were woven was like nothing I've ever read in a craft book and I truly thought that Card was just dumping in some words and chapters to allow Ender a moment to grow older. But no. Every scene he wrote had a purpose and closure. In two words, this book was unconventional and brilliant."
2,Very tedious reading,"Limited action. Lame sci-fi ""effects"" and very expected outcomes. This book was very hard to make it through. I won't be buying any of the others in the series"
5,Excellent quality,I found it easy to follow and quite enjoyed it. The speakers were excellent and clear in their pronunciation. Enjoy it!
4,Unbelievable,"I never thought I would enjoy a science fiction book, but this was unbelievably good. Recommended for anyone looking for a great story. The only bad part about the book is the ending, but the rest is absolutely fantastic."
5,Love!,"Love this boook, love the hardcover. very happy with it! Recommend this book to anyone i love the plot. Enders game keeps you on your toes!"
5,A Work of Art,"Orson Scott Card should truly be commended on his fabulous job of successfully capturing the perfect science fiction novel. Without knowing it, Card sets the reader up early in the novel by telling the reader that ""lies were more dependable than the truth."" Indeed, this quote is true in the novel. Card uses vivid descriptions of the futuristic setting in order to give the reader a true sense of where the story takes place. In addition, Card describes the main character gracefully and the events and obstacles that he must overcome in great detail. While reading the novel, it seems that Card is extremely predictable. But in the end, he completes a three-hundred and sixty-degree turn, and catches the reader off guard. The twist in the end is truly what makes the novel a complete success. I would definately recommend this novel to all science-fiction lovers and all non-science-fiction lovers alike. No matter what genre you enjoy, this novel is a must read."
5,Loved it!,I read a lot of OSC's books and this one really stands out. Really touched me and I shared it with all of my friends!
4,what a rush,"ENDER'S GAME STARTS OFF WITH SO MUCH DETAIL IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE HOW IT ENDS. THE ENDING OF THE BOOK ALMOST MAKES YOU FEEL THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A SERIES OUT OF THE BOOK. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE. I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE BOOK. I ACTUALLY LIKED THE BOOK, AND I'M NOT THAT MUCH OF A READER. THE ONLY WARNING THAT I'LL GIVE YOU IS THAT YOU MIGHT END UP READING THE SEQUAL TO IT BECAUSE THE ENDING KIND OF LEAVES YOU HANGING."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"This book was great!!!!!!!!,even though Card never developed any other characters besids Graff and Ender(maybe a little bit of his brother and sister too). It had a greta plot and the batles and the last fight was really cool. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It wasn't what I think Ender wouldv'e done. Other than that the book was really good."
4,Pretty Good,"Good Book, great characters, and i loved the way he explained the story. The only downside is the ending. The ending ends very abruptly and i didnt like the story at the end because of reasons that might ruin the story for some of you buying. Good Book overall.Highly Recommended for teens especially. 4.5 stars and a must read."
5,Harry Potter meets the Starship Troopers!,This book rocks! Ender is a small boy who is picked on by a bigger brother and some students in his school. He is quite the genious and it is obvious that he has great potential. He is being observed by the military to see if he is a good candidate to become an army commander and fight a war against an alien race of bugs. The training he goes through is intense and exciting to read. It involves a bunch of games that teach him military strategy as he must earn the respect of others in his school and proove that he is a great leader. There is a lot of cleverness in the way these games are played. This must be one of the greatest science fiction books ever written.
5,Wonderful Morality Play,"This novel is one of the most intriguing examinations of the use of military force and its ethical ramifications. What is the appropriate level violence to apply to one's enemies? Is OK to manipulate your own soldiers for the good of the people? The SF plot of the novel allows Card to use the canvass of an intergalactic ware to tell his tale.Beyond that, Ender makes for a fascinating character. The boy genius is a tortured, sympathetic hero like no other. Upon conclusion of the novel I rushed out and purchased Speaker For the Dead to follow Ender's further adventures.Often categorized as ""young adult,"" this is a wonderful read for any age."
4,the psychology of it all,"I don't normally read sci-fi (although I do watch it:) and I found this book to be more of an advanced read than I expected of a Sci-fi. Also, it is more captivating than Card's ""Lost Boys"" which I read about a year ago and found a bit simplistic. What was most interesting about this to me was the psychology of the book. The development of the prodigy, the training and techniquest that were used to challenge him to be what they wanted him to be, the character's perception of that ""manipulation""... It was great! If you liked Starship Troopers you'll like this book as there were some similar themes between that movie and this book: psychology, preception, propaganda/training, invading space bugs... All in all, I found it to be an entertaining book that had deeper meaning. I hope to whiz right through the series!"
4,Library binding is lame,This is my favorite book. This is the third time I've read it. I can't say enough about how good the story is. The library binding however was not quite the quality I was expecting. I would totally have been happier with just the paperback copy. I did like the fact that this book was printed in the U.S. If your purchasing this book for the first time you may as well order Enders shadow with it. The way Card intertwines the two books is absolutely genius.
5,Great Book,"At first I was somewhat wary of a book where the main character was as young as Ender, but from the first few pages you know that he doesn't think like a regular child, and is probably much smarter than the reader. His thoughts and the way he approached problems created a very interesting read, and Ender turned out to be very likable.The trials that ender is constantly going through keep things tense, and along with Card's easy to read writing style made sure I never wanted to put the book down."
5,great story. very engaging and thought provoking,I was recommended this based off my interest in Old Mans War. I really enjoyed this book as it seemed to touch on certain social and human issues that stirred up some thinking on my part. The story was interesting and well paced.
5,Science Fiction That's Not,"I am not a Science Fiction fan. I stumbled upon this book by accident as a bored ten-year-old. However, I instantly loved this book, reading it again and again, which I still do today. Card has the amazing ability to allow you to view the world through the character's eyes. I would highly recommend this book to ANYONE who just loves a good read."
5,The Best Book Ever,"Ender's Game is a chilingly realistic novel about a young boy, ender, who goes to fight an alien race called the buggers. His adventures bring him to asteroids, and space stations. Although the plot may seem somewwhat drab from this description, the best part is the writing style of Orson Scott Card. He explains anti-gravity orientation so well, it nearly makes you sick. The fight scenes are graphically depicted, and the ideas for war are increadable. At the end of the book, metaphors flood the text and review nearly the whole book. The ending keeps you wondering and the entire book stays with you for your entire life. If there was only one word I would use to describe this book, it would be ""perfect""."
5,the best,"I've read a lot of books, and many of them would easily warrant a 5 star rating on here, but I NEVER read the same book twice. The only exception I can possibly think of to this is Ender's Game. I read it twice in ONE WEEK. The first time through took only two days, and only about three days for the second reading. It was THAT compelling.After reading it just struck me as a book for the intelligent, and the reviews here seem to clearly support this notion. Many of the positive reviewers ""identify"" with the story, and most of the negative reviews are written about very superficial characteristics of the book (""What's up with having all these little kids trained for some war?"" ""Why were the kids naked so much""?).The most impressive aspect of the story is the style of writing, which flows so easily but can be extraordinarily vivid. And the psychological aspects are so engaging... I have never read anything so alive in the mind."
4,Ender's Game is an exciting and engaging novel,I feel that Ender's Game is a wonderful novel. It is easy to read and hard to put down. I highly recomend this book to any one who enjoys Sci-Fi. This book is going to surprise you.
2,Would recommend for young readers only,"I didn't hate this book, but I have to say that I would have enjoyed it a lot more when I was about 10-12 years old. If you read at that level (test: do you like Piers Anthony?) then you might enjoy this book. Adults should look elsewhere."
2,WAY overrated,"I was looking foward to reading this based on reviews. At least it was short and easy to read. Ender keeps going through the same fights, same promotions, same earnings of respect, same feelings of remorse, fighting the same mock battles, etc. Even his sister had to give him a pep-talk.....TWICE. That's a lot of repetition for such a short book.I had known about the ending already so I didn't even enjoy that so much. I may read the second. I doubt it even though I bought them together."
1,Avoid This Book,"If there is such a thing as ""the ugly American abroad,"" then this book is proof that there is also an ""ugly Italian abroad."" The book is poorly written and the author has no cultural sensitivity whatsoever. I grew up in Africa, and can't imagine that there is a reason for anyone to read this book."
1,Don't buy!,"I love Calphalon products, but this set of tongs broke almost immediately. The plastic ends are useless. Overall, this product is not up to Calphalon standards."
1,Not as advertised,"This item pictures many princesses, but the game is actually the Cinderella edition. So, if you are buying it because you want one with Ariel or Jasmine, do not purchase this one."
4,"SHERIE MULVANEY = Cumberland, Maryland","Sherie is from Cumberland, Maryland, where she began her singing career, harmonizing with her family at home and Church. She is also an accomplished tap, jazz and ballet dancer."
4,Conservative Comebacks...,"It doesn't really matter what your politics are--there will always be someone on the other side. So, if you prefer the conservative bent, this book is for you. Otherwise, read it to review your own ideas."
2,Go Back to the Source....,"As a conservative, I am baffled by this book's attempts to categorize certain arguments as being ""liberal"" and repsonses to them as being ""conservative."" It is possible for true conservatives to hold many positions that this book attributes to liberals. The ""facts"" presented on both sides are grounded in distortions and misperceotions. A better title would have been ""Partisan Reponses to Partisan Arguments.""Want to know what a real conservative response is based on? Go to the source: Barry Goldwater's principled, elegant, high-minded, venom-free ""Conscience of a Conservative."" Read that, get the FACTS, and you'll have more than enough material to engage in a good argument with a real liberal, as opposed to an apologist or a partisan. And after you're done, you can probably share a joke or two, as Senator Goldwater (and Orrin Hatch, today, for that matter) frequently did."
5,Exceptional tool when you just can't put your finger on it.,"Exceptional! This book is in the top left hand drawer of my desk at all times. After reading it, I kept it around to use as a great reference guide. Nearly everything your misinformed, left leaning friends might throw at you regarding politics is covered i.e. economics, the war, presidential policies and behavior, seriously, just about anything you can think of. It's an invaluable asset if you like to verbally joust with your liberal buddies. Who knows, you might even be able to bring them around to the right way of thinking! This book pulls no punches and absolutely gets right to the point. You have the choice of quick answers if you just want to pop and go, but following those ""quick answers"" are in depth, well thought out, factually based explanations. Do yourself a favor and buy it today!"
4,Conservative Combacks to Liberal Lies: Issue by Issue Responses to the Most Common Claims of the Left from A to Z,The book gives facts that are historically documented which most people have no knowledge. It's helpful to have this history along with facts and data when talking to a Liberal.
1,Is this a comedy book?,"Book is nothing more than the usual drivel you get from Fake News or drug addict Rush Limpballs. You don't need comebacks you need facts, and you are not going to get any here, just stale talking points that bare little resemblance to reality."
1,conservative combacks to liberal lies,"I thought this would be a good read,instead I found another author who thinks that being conservative ,we all should automatically go in for twisted thinking and outright lies. we have much more to offer than to sink to this level."
1,"Fallicies, Cheap shots, and Half truths oh My!",When I found this book in the bookstore I had to look it over. I didn't find many of the examples and comebacks used in this to be useful against people of my political persuasion.Most of the time the arguments used in this book fell under these types of responses.FallaciesPersonal AttacksChanging the SubjectBad use of Facts ignoring whether they have been debunked or notI admire the the work that conservatives like Greg Jackson have put into this. Everybody needs a Political Compass and all; however much more care needs to be put into arguments in this book.
1,This is Garbage,"This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country. There is no issue that is black and white, there are more sides to issues than just the right or left.This book may be for you if you are a mindless sheep who is to lazy to think for yourself.And this is only my opinion. Judge it for yourself."
3,Amazing Book,"I am a liberal democrat. This book is Amazing. By using the things in this book. A rightwing person never has to tell the truth or admit mistakes. It is almost frightening. I am adapting the methods as I go along to dealing with Right Wingers, by Liberals. If one can use this book to deceive and avoid truth concerning Liberals, the same method can work to deceive and avoid Conservative rhetoric.Thanks Gregg, you have given me a great tool use against the Right. Gregg is not a conservative, he is right wing radical."
1,Conservative comebacks?.. lmao!!!,"If you do your own research... listen to both sides, you won't need a book telling you how to ""comeback"" against alleged liberal lies."
1,HORRIBLE EXCUSE FOR A BOOK,All of the information in this book has been twisted around. If you read this you will get nothing but misinformation. Don't read and save yourself a nap :)
2,"Some fun, but shallow","If you're looking for an in-depth discussion of the issues, this book is not it. It is a repetition of the same conservative arguments that have been going back and forth on the blogs for years, although it is nice to have them all in one volume. Each comeback is only a few sentences long, and most are easily countered and don't contribute anything new to the discussion. If you're a progressive and want something that will be a challenge to your beliefs, but not too much of a challenge, then get this book (used, of course). If nothing else, it'll be good for a laugh. Conservatives, if you want a book that spends two hundred pages telling you how great you are because you oppose the evil America-hating liberals, then go for it. Otherwise, it's not worth your time."
1,ArmyMom,"Really!!! This is what you're ""arming"" us conservatives with? Your sending conservatives out to battle UNARMED against the liberals. SHAME ON YOU!!!"
1,when your out of facts...,Really? Could we use different points of view for once. You would think that after twenty or thirty years or so we would have seen some positive results in this country.
1,It is us who are the liars.,"I'm beginning to question my own conservatism. Especially after reading books like this. How can anyone be for the rights of the individual, yet not be willing to help individuals? The book is ripe with the same hate messages conservatives have become known for. There is no such thing as compassionate conservatism is there?"
3,Ought to be renamed,"This book, while well researched and indeed helpful, should have been called Republican Comebacks to Liberal Lies. A number of chapters deal with issues that concern only the Moral Majority and with which a Conservative involvement would (and did) disgust Barry Goldwater and any other libertarian/traditional Conservative. But still an entertaining book."
5,WOW! GREAT BOOK!!,"WOW! GREAT BOOK!! So nice to have all this information, all this wealth of truthful facts all together in one book! It is evident that a lot of work was put into writing this. The book brings a lot of clarity on the current issues; like global warming and why we shouldn't worry about it, to ILLEGAL immigration and why we SHOULD be concerned that illegals cost us billons more than they save us and the threat of terrorist coming over the border,etc...WOW! SO MANY FIGURES AND FACTS! PLEASE READ THE BOOK.... Also past issues; did you know that over 40 people who potentially knew of damaging evidence against the Clintons all wound up DEAD? Including 12 of Bill Clinton's body guards?? ... Very interesting stuff!If you are interested in having ""comebacks""; I highly recommend this book. Or if you are like me and just want to know the truth; I highly recommend this book."
5,"Reliable, easy-reference guide to issues","This book is a must-have for conservatives (and has the potential to convert liberals as well).Facts in this book are backed up by reliable sources, and a wide range of issues are covered (everything from feminism, to gun control, to the American media).The major aspect of this book that sets it apart from others like it is its efficient organization. Each chapter addresses a different issue, which is broken down into many aspects. Each ""liberal lie"" and ""conservative comeback"" is followed by a lengthier explanation. With my busy schedule, this easy layout makes it convenient to reach the information I need, and allows me to read for as long or short a time as I am able.This book will not go out of date, as it addresses both modern issues and those that have been in existence since the founding of our country."
1,Complete waste of money,"Save your money. This is a rehashing of the same old tired ""free market"" talking points. You can hear them for free by sitting down and listening to RNC-TV (Fox). If you want an objective view, do your OWN research - it is called google. People on the right are manipulated to hate those on the left, people on the left do not respect those on the right. Meanwhile corporate puppeteers work the strings, all the while robbing us all blind. WAKE UP! As long as we fight each other and allow propaganda to bypass our brains and go straight to our emotions we will allow others to quiet that nagging voice in the back of our minds that someone is not telling the whole truth. Until we come together and stop this fighting we put this country and our freedoms in serious jeopardy."
1,Not worth reading,This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. It is loaded with inconsistancies and incorrect information. Truly a conservative treatise.
2,Mr Jackon's rebuttal to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount,"Mr Jackson is fond of quoting the Old Testament, rather than the New. And for good reason. The sentiments expressed by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)-- and in particular the Beatitudes of Matthew 5-- Mr Jackson finds repugnant.The book can best be understood as a determined rebuttal of the Sermon, a single-minded attack on the very core of Jesus' teachings, dressed up as a diatribe on current American politics. The errors of fact and syllogism are myriad, but-- in the end-- of only minor consequence. It is his unrelenting hatred of the message of Jesus that should give us all for pause."
5,Better than I thought,The book is bigger and longer and more thorough than I thought it would be. You can find whatever topic you need from the table of contents. Logical.
4,Abortion Review,"I recently purchased this book because I am a conservative and I enjoy conservative dialogue and debate. However, I would like to comment on the few pages that address abortion. I consider myself a pretty gritty guy and I am really not too prone to be emotionally caught up in most issues but I was devastated by what I read concerning the manner in which abortions are conducted at various levels of pregnancy. Candidly people, it left me cold. I hate to profess my ignorance on the subject but I never really knew anything about some of the horrific procedures described therein. Good God; no wonder there is such an acrimonious debate over the right to life. If you have a daughter or a women in your life that might ever consider such a thing, please have them read this book for that section alone. Every man; every real man, irrespective of politics should also read it thoroughly.Ralph Jinks (my real name)"
1,wasteful money,"this was a waste of money, the book is written to get your money. I found it boring reads like a math book, doesn't contain any information that would be considered useful."
1,Just more Propaganda,This is just more propaganda that is put out as talking points. There is no true in this line of thought and nothing to offer.
1,Just awful,"Like the title of the review says, this book is just awful. Waste of your time to read. Definitely do not buy this book"
1,Worst book I ever read,Some people are saying this book was written by liberals to make the GOP look bad. Should not have been published at all.
1,What a load of stuff,"Just a bunch of crap for people who cannot think for themselves. Buy the Pat Robertson Fox Noise Crotch brothers books they are loaded with ""stuff"""
2,NOT THE BOOK I WANTED IT TO BE,"As a staunch conservative with lots of liberal friends, I wanted so badly for this book to be the definitive comeback book when confronted with stuff from the ""Bush lied, people died"" camp. I even ordered two copies so I could give one to a liberal friend. But after struggling through the first chapter on ""abortion"" and briefly skimming the rest, I sadly realized that this is not what is so desperately needed by conservatives.The bold faced statements are more like the Burma shave signs one used to see on the highway, and many have no weight or value. There is a lot of supporting material, but during an argument with a liberal, the other side is not going to listen politely while you get to the back up material.I'm sending both of these books back, and waiting for someone to write the book that I'm looking for."
5,Good book,The book provided an organized and comprehensiver approach to answering the circular logic of the liberals.
4,Conservative Comebacks,This book was well organized. I liked how information was presented. There was a lot of careful research in this book.
1,was hoping for some real advice here,but this book severely lacks any good debating material. Almost sounds as if it was written by a 10 year old. Seriously? Is this what we're supposed to use to defend arguments with?
4,Decent,"Yet another ""found footage"" horror movie.This one is pretty much a cross between Blair Witch and 80's horror movies. A group of 20-something college students travel to a cottage in the woods and end up finding monsters in the woods that are hunting them. The acting was pretty horrid but I'll give credit where credit is due.. This movie had a pretty original concept for the found footage genre. Most of these types of movies are about ghosts... This is one of the first to try a cryptozoology approach.I did think it was really lame of them to do a carbon copy of Paranormal Activity's DVD artwork... Obviously they were trying to cash in on the look of that movie."
1,Save your money.,"I'm pretty sure the other reviewers were either part of this film or family members, this movie was just plain and simply awful. Not only was the acting beyond terrible the whole plot of the film was non-existent, I did not once care about the characters and spend a grueling hour and ten minutes trying to figure out what I was going to do with the DVD afterwards. I would not torture anyone else with this. Put it this way, you sit there and watch a movie put together using various pieces of evidence someone outside the film is watching on a computer, accessing FBI intel. For the first hour you basically see a the main characters run around like a-holes pretending to be scared, when you finally get to see what is chasing them it's over and the film leaves more to be desired. Save your money. I'm on to the next ""found footage"" to torture my brain with."
4,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory it Ain't,"But, if you liked Charlie as a kid, you may just have the twisted sense of humor it takes for Dahl's adult fiction. And I do mean adult. It's a human pheremone-toutin, spouse-swappin, hoppin into bed with an unknown leper sort of extravaganza not for the faint of heart. If you like your stories with sex and your sex with irony and your irony with extra spicy irony on top of that, you may have found your new favorite author."
4,I.S. RULE THE WORLD!,FULL ON MADNESS FROM THE I.S. STABLE WITH A GREAT TRACK LISTING BUT ALSO A MIXES FROM BOTH LIZA N ELIAZ AND MANU LE MALIN. GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY AND I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS CD. PERFECT FOR THOSE WITH A SOFT SPOT FOR THE OLD SCHOOL AND ALSO THOSE FRESH TO THE HARDCORE TECHNO SCENE. WICKED!
4,Bad Amazon editorial review,"I'm only here to say that the Amazon editor for this album must've been on crack while writing his review. At no time is At the Gates, or the other boring, crappy band that he mentioned ever even close to being more brutal than Napalm Death.The nu-metal scene doesn't have the rawness and brutality that Napalm Death has always had. This editor definitely has his head way up his ars!!!"
1,Cheap chinese piece of junk,"This gauge got stuck at 550 (just above the red) shortly after I got it. Tank went empty, got it refilled, and the gauge won't budge. I'm certain it's got more in it than that. Should be reading closer to 1800 right after a refill. Tapped on it with a wrench, but it would not un-stick.Figures... it's made in China."
5,Good incense,One of the best incense out there. There is a much larger 250 gm box but this is a good box to get if you would just like to try it out. Very good seller and it's always a pleasure to do business with them.
4,Good product,"Good product, arrived quickly and was in new condition. The map is laminated, but the font is a little small. Overall a good product and will be helpful in your travels."
2,Paris Map by Borch,We bought a couple of different maps when preparing for a European trip last year. We found this map to be cumbersome and unhelpful. The maps in the travel guides met our needs as tourists who saw Paris by foot and Metro.
1,This seller sold me 2 broke laser toners,I have not been able to to use the toners until few months later. The rollers inside are all cracked and the way it prints out are like those crackle nail polish look. ScaryThe earlier one I got from the seller is stripes of none and some.......Don't know if I can return those 2 after a few months passed. Disappointing!!!!
5,Great product ..lousy seller,HP brand is top rate in consistent quality and value. This unit installs easily and gives you top rate print quality from the first copy.
5,Printer toner,HP Laserjet 06A Black Cartridge in Retail Packaging (C3906A)I was very pleased with my purchase of the toner ink which I ordered. It was a bit outdated according to the date on the package but the package was unopened and the toner in excellent condition. It works well with my HP laser jet printer. I was fully satisfied with the product.
2,Old Toner,Toner cartridge appeared to come in it's original box. Date on the box was November 2002 which makes the toner over 9 years old. I will not use this toner. Will have to dispose of it.
1,Unacceptable quality - refused to replace,"Ordered from Adorama camera store (adorama.com) - as a spare for my HP laserjet 3100. I needed it and tried to use it about 1 month after receipt. It is completely useless, was either too old or completedly used but can hardly read the print. Adorama refused to allow a return and replacement as the return period had expired. Warning to all those who want to save like me."
1,waste of money and time!!!,"Don't bother with this company. I ordered a toner cartridge for my HP printer, and it came with no toner in it. I sent an email to the seller and they tolled me to go after HP for replacement under the factory warranty. This is the first time in my life I ever had a problem with a new toner cartridge or ink cartridge. I think they are selling used stuff."
5,Laserjet cartridge,I will continue to buy C3906A Cartridge from you only. It is a perfect suite to my Laser printer. That is why in enjoy shopping on Amason.
5,Everything it promised,"The HP3906A ink cartridge I ordered was reasonably-priced, shipped promptly, and arrived quickly. As advertised, it was in its original retail packaging and was exactly as ordered. I especially liked the free UPS return label for recycling the old cartridge."
4,"Good Price, Good Quality","We needed a new cartridge for our old Laser Jet printer that we use basically for printing out quick jobs. I didn't want to spend a fortune, so I ordered this ons and it works like a champ."
1,Bait and Switch,"This vendor claims to sell a NEW HP Laser Toner cartridge but instead ships a cheap, remanufactured one. A complaint promises a correct part in replacement but you must pay to ship back the original junk one. As soon as they receive the imitation they then refund the original amount -leaving the customer with nothing but a freight bill for sending back the wrong part which legally you are entitled to keep.Very sleezy. Not sure I want to order from Amazon again after many satisfying transactions up until now. Sleezy. Very sleezy. I spend $9 and have NOTHING."
2,toner cartridge,"Cartridge arrived quickly and I was pleased, but it only lasted 3 weeks. I had to replace it. I won't be buying this one again."
2,Mixed esperience,"Ordered two C3906A cartriidges in January. The first lasted seven months with vey good performance. The second, ordered at the same time, lasted less than seven hours! Light printing => ""no"" printing - even after the normal shaking."
5,A new consciousness and the freedom from mediocrity.,Using my new IMAC24 has raised my consciousness and given me a sense of freedom from mediocrity.
4,SOPHISTICATED APPLE,"THE 24"" I MAC IS CERTAINLY A STATE OF THE ART BEAUTY. I DON'T MISS THE CUMBERSOME TOWER AT ALL. ITIS HOWEVER A CHALLENGING PIECE OF MACHINERY. PARALLELS, BOOT CAMP & WINDOWS WERE IMPOSSIBLETO INSTALL. EVEN THOUGH EVERY SALES CLERK ASSURES YOU IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE, IT'S ACTUALLY A TASK FORA COMPUTER WHIZ.IF YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO MICROSOFT WINDOWS IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TRANSCISION. USEING THIS UNITREQUIRES TIME CONSUMING SELF HELP AND A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE."
3,Not as good as you think,"The iMac is not a High Preformance gaming machine. It barely features any games for it, and it only has a 250 Gig hardrive. Now,The smallest hardrive is 400 Gigabytes. The computer itself is nice and you dont have to worry about lifting 40 pound moniters. But there are a few problems with the software. Mac OS X is not exactly a good way to go. It has few programs made for it. It can be complicated to use. Even after you've had 6 years of using Mac. Mac OS X is not as good as Windows Vista. In all, I dont think the Mac will impress you. I just cant recommend it."
5,Seeds Of Woody Plants of North America,"This text arrived in almost new condition. I was very pleased. It covers quite a bit of material, even the common introduced species. The drawings are helpful, especially if germinating a species for the first time. The directions are clear and concise. We have a woodlot and it will be most helpfull. I had online access to the previous edition, since taken down, but this is similar. Jocelyn"
5,Great Marble and Key Chain,This is a beautiful marble and terrific key chain. I use one and am buying this for a teenager who just got her license. I've dealt with this supplier before and am very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the timely delivery.
1,"BUYER BEWARE - THIS HELMET IS A TOY, NOT SAFETY GEAR","The labels on the box and inside the helmet read:""This helmet provides minimal padding against impacts to the head and does not meet any established safety standards. Check your local safety laws for required helmet use.""Unfortunately, this information is nowhere to be found on Amazon's product description.I'd rate it zero stars, but that's not an option!Hoping that Amazon will come through with a full refund..."
3,Mixed bag,"Though Douglas is extremely funny, a lot of the humor in this book is a little too campy. There are also quite a few interjection of upsetting things about his wolf raising and wolf facts. I found the mix of this and his humor made a hard read for me. I will definely read his other books."
3,Have yet to read...,"But from the first two pages, I am definitely looking forward to when I have time to actually read this! A whore in Butte, Montana. HILARIOUS! Maybe just to me as I'm in Montana."
3,A misleading title...,"I have to say, I only got this book because of the title. Any disappointment I have over the actual content is my responsibility alone; for it is NOT, actually, a Jewish-Japanese Sex and Cook Book and How to Raise Wolves. It is a story. I haven't read it. Advice: do your research before buying a book based on a funny name."
2,"Want to love it, but several problems","I have been using various Pur faucet filters through at least 5 units now. Originally the plastic rotate units, then 2 stainless in a row as I moved each time I'd just buy a new one leave the old behind. They are great.....EXCEPT that the case tends to crack nearest the faucet hookup. This is particularly quick to happen on the units that rotate. But it has also happened to me with the stainless steel unit just happened to me on a SECOND stainless now.ALSO the screw-on cap in front is a PAIN to remove. It's round and smooth and hard to find any grip on it when it's screwed in tight. They really should put a couple of flat edges to give your fingers somewhere to grab. Installing is difficult as well getting that last bit of turn-down to get it flush.I keep coming back to Pur though even with these defects they are a great value."
1,PUR now promotes Brita,PUR used to be an excellent product that lasted well over 5 years. Now they leak often before a year. They do have a replacement policy if yours messes up within the warrenty period but then you have to contact them and go out and always buy the Faucet Mount unit. After 15 years of using PUR filters I will now go to Brita and try them out once I use up my filters.
2,Metal over plastic CUT finger!,"At first I loved this filter and recommended this to friends, but now since I've had it for over 3 years, the front part (which is NOT stainless steel, but metal film of some sort OVER plastic) is peeling off and that part CUT my finger to the point of bleeding and bandaging. I even tried peeling off most of the metal part back so that it wouldn't cross my hand again and to save me from buying a new one, and somehow a piece still cut my finger again!I plan on writing the company and complaining about this. I doubt I'll buy another one. Plus, the water doesn't really taste as good as even the cheapest brand of bottled waters. But, that is just my taste preference."
3,Wrong Item,"I ordered the Pur Water Filtration horizontal brushed stainless steel model as a replacement item and was sent a cheaper plastic version. Order fulfilled by Buy D Best for $53. Identical plastic one sells from Amazon for $33. Will return item. Apparently the stainless steel model has been discontinued. Don't get fooled by the picture, it is the stainless model but a plastic version was sent to me. Newer plastic model is one click attachment, the older stainless model was screw on."
2,Not up to par,This is nothing like the photo--just cheap plastic that will not match if you have a brushed stainless faucet. I gave it away and will look for a better brand since PUR no longer builds anything like its FM-9100.
5,3 yeras - no problem,"I have been using this filter for about three years and I like it.Pros:- It does what it is supposed to do: filters tap water. The filtered water tastes better.- The unit is reliable, never broke.- To me, the slower filtered water is a plus because it indicates the many filtering stages it goes through.- Looks good.Cons:- A bit bulky.- Filters are expensive.- It seems to suggest filter replacement based on time, but not on volume of used water.Overall, I am please and would purchase it again. 5 stars."
5,A Time of Departing by Ray Yungen,"This book is a ""must read"" for all who are serious about their faith. Sadly fundamentalism has become a dirty word but as long as we believe that the Bible is the Spirit inspired Word of God, then we must heed what is written therein."
5,Christian leaders and laymen NEED TO KNOW!,Believers should be aware pof the insidious perversion of this unbiblical meditative process of prayer. It is essential that we counter this with a true and faithful Bible exposition of New Age-Buddhist incursion into evangelical purposeful prayer.
2,Starts off OK but really pushes the boundaries of common sense,"In many ways, Yungen's book is good. It rasies serious questions about the influence of Eastern thought and metaphysics in modern Christianity, and some of his points are quite valid. However the conclusions that he draws regarding cnetering prayer eventually become very tenuous and downright tangential. To be blunt, his reasoning goes like this:A: Eastern mystics chant mantras (""om"")B: Contemplative prayer sometimes involves repeating a word or phrase (""Jesus"")C: A=B, therefore contemplative prayer is un-ChristianAnother form of his reasoning:A: Eastern religion influenced the Desert FathersB: the Desert Fathers influenced Thomas MertonC: Thomas Merton influenced Richard FosterD: Richard Foster influenced Rick WarrenE: therefore Rick Warren believes in Eastern religionPlease read this book critically if you read it at all."
1,Do your own research!!!,"This book is fine if you don't have a bible handy to confirm quotes that Yungen uses to contradict his opponents. The vast majority of his quotes (most 3 to 4 words) are taken out of context. Check his bible references.... I don't know if contemplative prayer is dangerous, driven by evil spirits or truly a way to be close to God, but I do know that Yungen misquotes the bible to sway readers."
4,In need during this strange spiritual hour.,"The mixture of New age practices in the church is getting more and more prevalent. The term New Age is no longer used, it is now the ""New Spirituality"". Our pastors and leaders are being mislead that we can use pagan practices to reach God in the name of Jesus. The New Age has a Jesus as well, it is not the one in the Bible though. More christians need to read the information in this book to equip themselves of any deception that might be confronting them or their family."
5,The most complete study of the current apostacy in the church,"My husband and I have both read this book, and purchased multiple copies to give to friends. Ray Yungen has succeeded in bringing forth the truth about the current trends in the church and those who are promoting them. Any Christian with discernment will find this book a necessity in these days, for it truly helps the reader make sense of the new terms and trends within the church and the spirit of error within each one. We have referenced it time and again. Lighthouse Trails publishing/Research is truly a light for truth in this world of spiritual deception. Many thanks for publishing this great book for Mr. Yungen."
5,A Must Read,"This book is a real eye-opener for anyone searching for the truth. The enemy is already in the camp working from WITHIN the church. Starting slowly, deliberately and deceptively through half truths, the truth of God is changed into a lie. We are definitely in the end times as we see this happening all around us and yet many in leadership positions in the church appear to be blinded or are asleep. This truly is the time of the Laodicean church - luke warm. This is the only reason the deceivers can make inroads - so many of God's chosen (or pretenders) are apathetic or sound asleep. This book, if they will read it, can open their eyes to the truth. I recommend sharing this book with others - spread the word."
4,Warning for Christians,A warning for Christians to not be deceived with the lies coming into the Church. 2 Timothy 4:3 says the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine. This book gives a heads up on what myths are blowing into our midst.
5,Shock oil,How can you go wrong with the wide verity of six different types of shock oil. If one doesn't work with your set up try another type of oil. I would buy this product again.
4,Sharp has a Winner !,I bought this Sharp Aquos and the crisp picture quality is excellent!. Amazon price was a great deal and the White Glove Delivery service was handled very professionally. I would recommend this TV to any HDTV Fan!
4,Crocodile on the Sandbank,"Our bookclub read this and the majority of the people thought it was an excellent read. The reviewer added a great deal by sharing her experiences at the location of the story in Egypt. I was fascinated by the main character and her bravado as a woman diuring the Victorian era. I am ready to read some of the books that follow in this first in a series of eighteen. I found it hard to put down, a few folks in our group didn't find it that interesting. Worth my time!"
4,Utterly charming!,"Fans of historical mysteries and those fascinated with Egyptology will love Crocodile. I wish I had discovered the series sooner. I fell in love with Walter Emerson and the fair Evelyn. Although the ""bad guy"" is rather obvious, one doesn't mind since the conclusion is delivered with wit and twist.Also recommended: Aaron Elkins' GIDEON OLIVER series starting with Fellowship of Fear. And most wholeheartedly: Candace Robb's OWEN ARCHER series starting with THE APOTHECARY ROSE."
5,For the Egyptophile,"The primary requirement of the fiction writer is to take the reader away and convince him or her that the new setting has a certain reality. This is true of every genre, sci-fi, western, mystery, romance.... Elizabeth Peters does an absolutely remarkable job of that in this novel. Granted, I have a positive predisposition for books set along the Nile; nonetheless this one is outstanding.The plot and mystery might be described as so-so, but the characters and the ambience of Egyption archaeology in Victorian times are perfect. The strange romance between Peabody and Emerson is certainly not of the standard variety. The tombs, the sand, the pyramids, the terrace at Shepheard's...they are enough to carry one away.I've now read the first four in this Amelia Peabody series and so far have found them all to be most convincing."
1,Where's the mystery in this mystery?!,"I can't wait to finish this book . . . Because it feels like it's taking forever. I gather that the reader is not supposed to really like the protagonist -- that she's a general pain in the neck to everyone she meets. That's OK. Not all protagonists are meant to be likeable.But where is the mystery in this mystery novel? I'm half-way through the book, and the only ""mystery"" so far is that someone has made an appearance as a phantom mummy. There's more mystery in an old episode of Scooby-Doo!Without a compelling plot to move things forward, the characters have become more grating than interesting. If you're considering this book, read the first few pages. If you like the character(s), then by all means go ahead. If you don't, stop there, my friend, and put this book down."
3,Not quite a mystery,"The first half of the book is a romance-like novel of the Victorian age, replete with lost loves, lost fortunes, lost virtue. Miss Peabdy is busy rescuing the delicate assistant, Evelyn. Then when she has all that taken care of off she is into what feels like a different book. The mystery comes blowing like hot sand with lovely Evelyn shimmering about between her two lovers (or three.) Then comes the end and you actually dont care. The end is not quite a bombshell, you can not say you did not suspect it. My verdict: not as good as I would have liked it to be. After reading the reviews, I ran out and bought three of her books. Now I am not if I will read the others."
4,Amelia's first mystery,"I love beginnings, and the first Amelia Peabody mystery is a sentimental favourite that I still adore everytime I read it. A strong, commonsense heroine, and characters that seem real and humourous at the same time. I enjoyed this book, not so much for the mystery, but for the engaging conversation and interaction between the characters. The tone is set through Amelia's storytelling which still makes me smile with her ""Victorian"" interpretations of Egyptian life and her companions. I love human conflict and a good mystery, and I'm a sucker for romance. This is a great read on a cold rainy day when you want to escape to the heat of Egypt."
3,Decent read,"Not a great book but a decent read. Not your typical mystery. No murder to solve, just a case of identifying who is pulling pranks and understanding why. A bit slow developing and a bit contrived."
4,The perfect beginning....,"I started this series a few summers ago with book #3, The Mummy Case, and then read them consecutively. Since I obtained them from the library I was never able to read the first two novels. I finally broke down and purchased this book from Amazon---what a great beginning to the series!! It was interesting to learn how both sets of Emersons ""got together"", and to see both Walter and Evelyn as young and adventurous, though younger, they always seemed much older than Amelia and Emerson. This series of books is fun, interesting, educational and definitely adictive. I have the 2nd book on hold at the library and am getting ready to again reread this series, it has become my summer tradion. IF you are an Ann Perry fan, enjoy mysteries, the Victorian era and Egypt, you'll love this series."
4,A Little bit of Victorian Egypt.,"This book is our introduction to the world of Amelia Peabody and and her adventures in Egypt during the Victorian age. Ms. Peters has a fine sense of time and place, and her descriptions of Egyptian antiquities as they would have appeared in the 19th century are quite realistic and accurate. We also get to meet the irascible Amelia Peabody. She is actually very funny, and nothing more so than her frequent diatribes about the strictures placed on women at this time in history. The book does get a bit melodramatic with star-crossed lovers and threatening mummies, and the mystery is quite easy to figure out. But in spite of that, it's a pretty good read, and serves as a good introduction to Amelia's world."
5,I didn't know what to think...,"...at first, but Elizabeth Peters has just gained a new fan! I was struggling with purchasing this novel at first; I didn't know if I would like the Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones - esqe type of story. I was more into the Robinson/Haney type of Egyptian mystery. When I finally started to read it though, it grabbed a hold and drew me in. I must say it was a fantastic read. If you like Egypt, then this book is for you."
1,Pompous and arrogant,"I had high hopes for this book, as it had come strongly recommended to me. What a disappointment! I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters, who struck me as either overbearing bulldozers or understated doormats. Peters' knowledge of Egyptology is indeed impressive and definitely the only enjoyable part of this book. But for the mystery itself: by the time I was halfway through, the solution was so obvious to me that the perpetrators may as well have been announcing their intentions on a microphone. I was relieved when it was over."
3,"Good book for female readers, IMHO. And what a twist at the middle!","This is the first Elizabeth Peters book I read. To be fair, given the high rating this book gets here on Amazon, I was expecting something different and was quite disappointed at first. I was expecting some more action and less romance. But I blame 'The DaVinci Code' for that :) For The first half of the book I was plain bored and was tempted to quit reading a few times. However, right at the middle of the book, things got twisted and the story changed to something much more interesting. I got hooked. Action, monsters, mysteries, superstitions, everything got mixed very well by Mrs. Peters and also the ending was great and quite enjoyable. I might not read another book in the series, but that does not mean this is a book you should skip, specially if you are a female reader."
5,Wonderful! Exciting!,"I was looking for a book that was just a little bit different. It seemed that all the books I had been reading had become more sexual, more than a little use of profanity, more predictable and less plot and surpeise. While I don't mind sex and a few 'colorful' words here and there they had become more than less. The first installment of The Amelia Peabody Series left me wanting more. Three months later, I had read all 18 books and would kill for another. You'll read them, next listen to all of the audio books with Barbara Rosenblat entertaining you with her many different voices/accents. Next, you may even become truly addicted and begin to collect the 1st editions. Never have I been so captivated with one author! Enjoy!"
5,A fun read!,I read this for a book club. I did not think I would like it but it was fun reading and a good change of pace for me.
2,Had to be the slowest and most tedious book I have read in a long while.,"I tried to read this book, yet I am still not finished and I usually finish books quickly. If it is a great book, I may read it all in one sitting, but I downloaded this book over 2 months ago and have yet to get more than halfway through. I don't want to be a spoiler(though thus far, there is not much to spoil) so I won't comment on the ""mystery"" which seems to be discussed very little anyway in this book. I saw this had very high rankings so I had high hopes, but it has done nothing but disappoint. I enjoy flowery language and writers who are descriptive but Ms. Peters takes it to the extreme, as not every inanimate object needs to be described to the lengths she takes. It becomes quite tedious to wade through it all."
1,"Stuffy, predictable and annoying!","I borrowed this book a while ago, hoping for an enjoyable light read. Unfortunately not.The main character of this series, Amelia Peabody, is supposedly interesting. Unfortunately not. Obsessed that men are the evil of every age, her rants occupy almost every page. Her ""supposed insights"" and commentary were so long that I found myself speed-reading through the pages, scanning as many as 20 pages every few minutes.The sidekick is just as annoying. While she isn't complaining about the weather, she is busy fainting.Anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the ""Mummy"" was. What little intrigue there was, was ruined by the predictability.Although the writing was quite enjoyable, it was ruined by many of the characters. I'd take one of the case studies of Sherlock Holmes over this any day. Or any book by PD James or JD Robb."
5,Amelia Peabody Series is a Winner!,"My husband's aunt suggested I read this during a summer vacation at the lake. Once I picked it up, I was hooked. Elizabeth Peter's tale of the plucky Egyptologist held my interest from cover to cover. Amelia Peabody is an interesting woman of intelligence and wit. This is more than a mystery novel; the characters are well rounded, the plot holds many secrets which are revealed as the story unfolds, I just could not put it down. In fact, I came to Amazon and ordered the next 8 books in the series. Highly recommend it to anybody."
5,A Wonderful Series!,"I am re-reading this series, as I have greatly enjoyed these characters over the years. I decided to start again at the beginning, and thoroughly enjoyed the book for a second time. The very modern character of Amelia Peabody resonates well with the modern woman, despite being set in Victorian times. I love the humor in the stories, and the care that the author has for historically accurate details make it all the more interesting."
4,Peabody The Great's First Tale,"Peter's Peabody is a great heroine. She is strong, smart, and very capable. However, she needs to find one complement before she can reach her true potential, and she does that during her first mystery. This book sets up the franchise of mysteries that involve this cast, as well as introducing the reader to many interesting facts about ancient Egypt. Setting the stories in this setting keeps them from becoming rather stale and pedestrian in this particular book. Hopefully, succeeding books will not be forced to rely upon exotic locations to keep things interesting, but we will have to see. Overall very enjoyable and fun."
1,Listen to what others say!,"I bought this in spite of reviews because it was the same company that made my walker. Not only did it not fit, it broke when I put it back in the package to return."
2,"Poor fit, weak welds","Basket did not securely fit onto walker frame, when I tried to bend the hook welded to the center of the basket as pictured, the weld broke."
1,Keeps Collapsing,"This sounded like a great idea over the metal baskets, but was not. The plastic pieces that snap together to hold the bag open are not secure and come apart if you even touch it, let alone take things in and out of the basket. I was going to buy a wire basket for Mom, but the maintenance man at her facility finally crammed it on backwards and while it is still always collapsed (we don't even bother trying to fix anymore) it is at least stable and collapsed which allows her to carry around her few small items. Can't imagine this ever passed any quality inspections - what were they thinking with such a poor design?"
3,walker basket,"Nicely made basket, Be careful tho; it's made for Carex equipment. I have a different make rollator, and had to do a lot of adapting to make it fit on. That said, it works fine now."
3,Okay,I purchased this for my mother who had a hip replacement. It was nice in theory and worked rather well in the the morning. The bulky size made it difficult to navigate in her narrow hallway.
4,Great basic basket,"Light weight so doesn't cause walker to tilt forward too much, depending on what is put in it. Good space for carrying, especially the elastic bands on one side to keep things in their place. Wish it were done in a lighter color so one could actually see what is in it - especially remotes, which tend to be black as well.This is the second of this variety I have had as the first one broke (oddly the metal rim separated at the joint a month or two after one of the braces came out of its grommet. Needless to say, it is not the strongest of carriers, but I greatly prefer it over the wire basket."
4,Great for my Father,"I ordered this for my father, and it works like a charm, he tends to fall even with his walker, and the basket will come off when the walker goes over, but some velcro cord ties stopped that problem. Now people are asking him where he got it."
1,extremely disappointed,"At first I loved it, but I soon discovered that it fell apart. I should have returned it but I was busy and time got away from me. One the the side brackets, that keep it in place, came off and I never did find it. I would not have been able to fix it as it tore a hole in the fabric which made it useless. Would I recommend this product, absolutly not!!"
4,Practical reading,This book is practical with NO formula but an honest approach to obesity. It is a Christian commitment approach and I certainly would recommend it to someone interested in losing weight without oputting large amounts of money as the commercial weight loss programs. I have already recomended it to my daughter for her consideration.
4,Great addition to our nativity.,"My wife has been searching for years for the right nativity scene. It seems like the only thing available was either so cutesy it made your teeth hurt or so ugly it made your eyes hurt. She finally found the Demdaco Willow Tree line and fell in love with it. I have to admit it's a very attractive set and, in my opinion, the best one out there. These were an addition to her basic nativity set. They look great with the rest of the Willow Tree stuff. The detail is nice and although they're somewhat mass produced, they look like hand-carved originals.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the cost. Amazon has great prices but these are expensive no matter what you do."
2,picture is deceiving,"Deceiving seller. The picture and description lead you to believe that you will get more than you do. The star piece is not included, even though it leads you to think that it is. I will purchase these figures from another seller in the future."
4,"Nice, but few pieces","My girlfriend likes the Willow-tree figurines, so I got her this set for Christmas. It has just the basic items to start your nativity scene with, Mary, Joseph, Jesus, two lambs, a donkey, and a shepherd with another lamb in his arms. I, myself, find the willow-tree figurines overpriced and bland. I would prefer more use of color and the lack of facial expressions amplifies the blandness."
3,As described except broken,The creche was broken. It could have happened during shipment. My husband was able to fix it. It was a little more battered than I expected but for the price it was ok.
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"One of the ears on the donkey was broken when received. Also, I thought the donkey was a little too small."
3,staf warning,The set is quite beautiful. Bought for my daughter. Nicely sealed. She opened Christmas warning. It said before you open read the warning. Do not remove Joseph by the staf. She opened it and the staf was already broken. Too much of a hassel to send back. Not attached very well. We will repair ourselves.
5,Willoe Tree Cache,THIS IS A VERY NICE CRECHE & WILL COMPLETE YOUR NAVITY SCENE. IT IS EXACTUALLY AS DECRIBED. I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE LOOKING FOR A CRECH TO PURCHASE THIS ONE.
5,Love it,I love Willow Tree. I was very excited to purchase the nativity. I love the workmanship. It is beautiful. I love the detail.
1,NOT RECEIVED AS OF 12-30-10,"This product has not yet been received. Therefore, unable to review it. Can you help me with this?"
5,Great price.,Ive been shopping for this nativity scene. This price was so much better than anywhere else. I'm so happy to have it on display this year!
5,Dependable,"I was not able to find the item in a store, so I went home and found it online. I should have started online. The product arrived promptly and well packaged. Totally painless holiday shopping."
5,Nice item,I ordered this for my daughter who is collecting the set of Willow Tree Navitity figurines. Good gift at a good price.
5,great product!!!,It came perfectly packaged and has never been opened! The figures were exactly as pictured and came earlier then the expected shipping! Definitely very happy with this purchase
5,Willow Tree Song of Joy Angel by Susan Lordi,"This was a gift I gave for CHRISTmas and I have not seen it directly. The shipping was on time and I was told this is beautiful and fits the rest of the Nativity seen great, she put it behind the manger and loves it."
5,Nativity set,"I love this Nativity set. Every time I see it , it takes my breath away. I love it. I hope to add more pieces soon."
5,Beautiful Nativity Set...,This Willow Tree nativity set is simply beautiful; very peaceful looking. The quality is nice. I'm so glad I ordered it and Amazon has a great price.
5,Excellent,"Product shipped fast and was in described condition. Gave these to my mom for Christmas, and she loved them! That's 5 stars in my book. :D"
5,Popular for a reason!,Willow Tree Nativity - 6 Piece Nativity SetEveryone loves this gift!! Great item.
5,Very nice items,Perfectly shipped and arrived quickly. This set really completes nativity. The pieces are very well made. Definitely recommend this set
4,For Nativity,"I like this angel, it looks nice and is well made (the base and pole screw tightly into the angel). For some reason, it doesn't seem to be 100% cohesive with the rest of the nativity I have (stars, nativity, & shepherds so far) - but part of that might be that I'm just not used to seeing it. I do like increasing my collection and I will continue to set up this angel, and possibly the other if I get that as well."
3,Halloween,"Did its job as a great keith Stone. Everyone at the bar loved the costume, gotta get the wig ot go with it."
1,big cap,"this cap is too tall to sit well on your head, it goes way down to your ears, don't recommend this, they only have one size..."
4,Good Hat (for me),"Fits my big(ger) head just fine. Other ""one-size"" hats too small. Very comfortable. Double snap closure secures well. Order multiples to justify the shipping cost."
3,I thought I had a big head,"This hat is really big, looks a little funny on my head cause the sides bulge out a bit. I had a nice Von Dutch hat that my dog chewed up, and I thought this was a great replacement...but I should've listened to reviews.Its a 3 star for me because of price...otherwise 2 star"
3,"VERY TOUCHING FILM, BUT TOO SLOW PACED","Granted, ""Heavy"" does have its touching moments and the performances are magnificient. In the end though, I found the movie to be EXTREMELY slow-paced. Maybe it was intended to be slow, in order to show how slow Victor (James Mangold) is because of his weight. Or maybe its a metaphor for how slow his life is. In any case, the slow-pace hurts the movie and doesn't help it. Also Victor should have had more lines of dialogue. I think I heard him say about 4 lines during the ENTIRE MOVIE. Despite its shortcomings, I enjoyed ""Heavy"" somewhat. Worth a rental, nothing more."
4,The Jordan Plantation?????,"Quite a bit of useful data on colonial New England.However, where is mention of the Jordan Plantationof Spurwink and Scarborough Maine, that was destroyed in the King Philip's War 1675-1678? It was founded by Rev Robert Jordan,minister of Spurwink, Casco, and Saco, Maine, and there is a book, missing from the bibliography.....The Jordan Memorial.... by Tristram Frost Jordan Picton Press, Camden ME."
3,"Seen Worse, Found Better","I purchased this book based mainly on the reviews written here at Amazon.com. While I would not say I am dissapointed, I do think this book (and every other ""beginners"" book I have read) could be alot better.This book starts off well enough giving pretty detailed information on what is going on and why, however, as soon as you think you are beginning to get a grasp on the material, the author seems to forget that you are a ""beginner."" About half way through the book, you begin to feel as though you are simply writing the code that is presented and not actually learning what is going on.If you are more of a visual learner, as I am, I would suggest a membership to LearnVisualStudio.Net instead of purchasing any more books. (No, I am not affiliated with them) After only two days of watching videos from that site, I have learned more than I did reading the entire Microsoft Visual Basic .NET Programming for the Absolute Beginner book."
1,Not for the beginner,Not worth the money. Little explanation of anything especially how he achieved the results he describes. Even the first page is a chart with no explanation. Don't buy if your interested in learning about the Forex. I should have known better with a title like that!
2,Peter Bain How to make money writing a book,Peter Bain's an intelligent man but not a great teacher. I suggest that he needs to have an editor that is a teacher because he is all over the place in this book.Although he is best known for his Forex course (which I think is good) this book is mainly about the stock market and futures.I think this book has about two good chapters with limited information for my money.
3,Falls a little short of the mark.,"This manual promises more than it delivers. The only really useful information concerns the commitments of traders reports. There are some graphs and a little technical analysis, however, these examples leave you wanting more information. Not as complete as I would have liked."
2,how to trade like a pro?,"the book seems to be out dated and although i realize that just one book can not do justice to the specific knowledge of stocks and options ect.... this book was just painted with too big a broad stroke to really get a detailed idea of what the author was trying to convey. he should have stayed with one subject; stocks, or options, or forex, ect.. I have his forex course and it is all over the place but eventually he gets to the point, and the point is knowledge is king, and without knowledge of what you are doing , your lost. he try's to make this a point in his book also, but..... the 2 stars are only because i already knew what he was talking about."
4,Awesome Toy,"I really love this toy it's awesome! Sunny Days is my favorite pony and she looks really pretty in her outfit and everything comes off! ( the reason I wrote the last line was because I saw in other reviews that people were complaining that stuff wasn't coming off.) Anyway it's really fun, get this toy ( hope this was helpful Brooke)"
3,Rowdy Ann Short,"Honestly, I bought this DVD souly for the ""Rowdy Ann"" short feature which stars my cousin Fay Tincher. She was called the Female Charlie Chaplin of her day and it is very difficult to find any of her works on DVD and so I jumped at the chance to get this DVD."
5,Working great with my new Samsung TV.,I just bought a brand new Samsung TV and this product same day. The connectors snap right into place and hold firm. I have noticed threw other reviews that Samsung used to have problems properly fitting fiber optic cables. That curse seems to be lifted. It fit perfectly into both my TV and sound system receiver. Of course the sound is supreme. Considering how long the cable is I would truly say that this one is a bang for your buck.
5,Great Optical Connection,"Works great. Makes a great connection (snaps) on the different connections I used it on. Sound quality is great. Stereo, digital and DTS all come through the cable loud and clear.It seems like a very high quality cable. Great price.I liked the first one so good, I bought a total of 3. One 6 foot one, and 2 12 feet ones."
2,Steer Clear,"For all intents and purposes, this cable ""works"" -- but as another reviewer noted, it does not fit correctly into all optical ports. It fits (clicks) just fine in half of my devices, but the other half it's essentially just sitting in the hole. Slightest movement could/would knock it loose.I will probably be ordering a different cable to replace this, as I don't like having loose connections like that.Even in devices it wont ""click"" into, it does still work."
2,Not worth it,"i got this cable for using my gaming headphones and the sound degradation when compared to the 6 feet cable i was using was very severe. Many folks say that ALL optical cables are the same, not true. The quality of the medium for the signal (red light) to travel is of most importance and this Belkin failed to deliver the quality at 12 feet.Good distance, poor quality."
5,Connectors work well,"This optical cable arrived and works as advertised. Much cheaper than other options. Contrary to other reviews, there was no problem with the compatability of this cable with my Samsung LN55C650 TV and Sony STRDE-945 amplifier optical inputs. The cable snapped securely into both pieces of equipment without modification. (Other reviewers stated that the cable did not fit their Samsung tv's). The cable also securely snapped into the optical audio output from my media center computer. I like the optical end covers that are attached to the cables to protect the ends when not in use. Other cables have had removable caps which I have since lost. At least I know where the caps are now!"
5,Great Product! Great Price!,The product arrived quickly. The Belkin Pure A/V cable was much better quality than the product that I had purchased previously from Best Buy. The best thing is that the cable was twice the length at a fraction of the price.
1,Awful,"Completely incompatible with AOL, not using the browser, but simple email. Norton blocked all programs and sites which use navigational pop-windows. (Amazon is acually of good example) Of course, all help is useless from outsourced workers, and this was certainly no exception. After turning all parts of Norton Internet Security off to get normal browsing use, I finally had to uninstall it to get any work done. Norton sucks!"
2,Less Than I Bargained For,"Unlike previous versions of Norton Internet Security Suite, this version does not include parental controls."
4,Maybe Norton finally gets it!,I stopped using Norton after tiring of the slowing down of the computer and actually not being able to get a complete scan done without the computer shutting down. I used PCcillin (spelling?) for a year but switched back to Norton at the recommendation of a friend. So far no problems. The 3 user was a good buy even with using for only two computers so far. It does not seem to slow the computer and does not have intrusive pop ups. My rating would be 5 stars except from residual wariness based on past experience with Norton.
2,DLA confilct,"If anyone can resolve the conflict between this program and DLA, you will be a hero. Please post!"
2,Norton Internet Security Suite 2007 - 3 User/ Wrong Choice,"It loaded fine, must of missed fine print about removing Spam product and Parental controls dumb me. Most controls and settings in 2006 are gone in 2007, definately a dumded up product for users not familiar with any computer set up. Would trade this in for the old 2006 in a heartbeat, compared 2006 was a 5 Star product.....they have lost me as a customer after this one expires!!"
1,NIS 2007 - Titanic of Software,This is the Titanic of software! It allowed a major virus through that disables my PC after 3 minutes of being on. Tech support wants $99 consult fee and doesn't seem to care I'm upset with Norton. Tech support needs to go back to school to solve their language barrier! I read all the other reviews and like others have gone from the OK user to the upset never again user. If you are happy with NIS 2007 you will agree with me sooner than you expect. The clock is ticking when your PC will melt down due to Norton. I didn't think it would happen to me either. Take a hint of prevention now and dump Norton while you still have your sanity.
1,Slow!,"I think Symantec is run by a bunch of folks who are completely cut off from their customers and don't give a dang. Each release of NIS is screwed up in one way or another and they provide no way to give feedback.In the case of NIS 2007 ... its just slow as a dog. Its increased my system startup time by about 4 minutes, it has slowed my MS Office startup time and takes forever to scan my computer.I don't know what security product is better ... but this one is a toad!"
1,Unable to access the internet,"After using NIS for years,my daughter and I were unable to access the internet.Working with their tech resolved the problem,but after this happened the third time we disconnected it.My local tech said there have been many problems with NIS 2007,and to use WIN Xp firewall and a separate virus program instead.I have been using BitDefender which has daily updates and costs $25 and have not had any trouble.Naturally Norton would not give me a refund."
2,AIM 6 NOT Covered,"After purchasing NIS 2007 (for 3 PCs) I installed it on two of my computers. AOL Instant Messenger version 6 is also installed on both of these computers. While Norton claims to provide instant messaging scanning for AIM 4.7 or later, it does NOT work with AIM version 6.I have spent 2 weeks going back and forth with Symantec Tech support and the issue is still not resolved. No coverage for AIM version 6."
1,Not Impressed At All,"I had the same problem the ""Tax Guy"" had. Everytime I would try to close Internet Explorer 6, it would close and then popup and error and ask if I'd want to send and error report to Microsoft. After a couple unsuccessful Symantec Support chat sessions, I was two seconds away from getting a refund. As a last effort, I disabled a few un-needed Internet Explorer add-ons. And sure enough, that solved the problem.Regardless, I'm running a new 3.0ghz Dell with 1gb of memory and Windows XP Professional. Shame on this software for not just ""working"" out of the box in such a powerful and common system like mine."
1,Norton Internet Security has problems,"After buying Norton Internet Security for about ten years, I read too many unhappy reviews. I had some problems installing Norton, but it caused a serious problem with Internet Explorer. It crashing at least twice a day. A friend asked if I had Norton and said they often caused problems with Internet Explorer. I tried ZONE ALARM Internet Security Suite for three computers [Amazon sells it]. It installed quickly after I answered three questions. It completely installed and it set-up the Firewall and all basic security provisions. I just sat back and watched it install. I will never go back to the Norton problems again. Norton seems to have forgotten how to make a program install without some headaches."
5,Upgraded from Antivirus 2006 to Internet Security 2007,"Decided to upgrade this year to IS2007 because it was actually less expensive than Antivirus 2007 with the addition of a rebate. All Norton programs I have used, have always been easy to install and works very well for my purposes (Internet browsing, Email, etc). I have been using Norton products for the past 4 years and have never been disappointed. IS2007 is no exception."
2,2007 Norton Internet Security,"Norton is the ""top"" of the line for security but this version has really slowed my computer down compared with the last three versions."
1,AVOID - An absolute PIECE OF JUNK,"Been using Norton Internet Security for the last 4 years. No real problems except for obvious sluggishness of my PC after installing it but okay I can put up with that. My PC was always stand alone with an internet connection but recently installed a little home Network - and thats when the nightmares began. This product will NOT allow me to share a folder on my network. Have scoured the internet for solutions, which was an eye opener as LOTS of people have had similar problems with this product, spent 3 hours with some symantec technical ""support"" guy located in India and I still have the problem. On top of that it is almost impossible to remove from a computer once installed unless you hack your registry, and lastly one of the worst things is you CANNOT kill the cc* processes that it spawns. My solution to my problem was to buy myself a copy of ZoneAlarm Internet Security and lo and behold have had no problems whatsoever."
1,Very disappointed in this version,"In order to download 07 I had to uninstall 06, but first I had to download the uninstaller from symantec. Very annoying. I also lost all my preferences. My computer is unbelievably slow with this version and it constantly is disconnecting from the internet (i have highspeed cable). I'd like to know who came up with the idea of making the parental controls with LESS features then the year before. What is the use of having parental controls if you can't really control anything? This years version in less intuitive then last year and give the user less control then in previous version. I'm done with norton. Don't waste your money."
1,Horrible,"I am a computer Hobbyist so all of my friends ask me to help them.Not only is this a horrible program that takes over your computer, is impossible to configure, slows everything down much more than any of the other security suits out there. but worst of all it is often impossible to uninstall!!!Dont even try it! sometimes the only way you will get it off your computer is to format your hard drive!This is something I have seen on many computers."
1,This software SUXS. SpybotSD incompatable,"I've been using Norton since 2000. I've had Internet Security 2005 and 2006.So when it was time I bought the 2007 version.The first thing it told me was that the spybot checker I use was incompatable and I would have to remove it. (SpybotSD ver. 1.4)I stopped right there. If it's a toss-up between Norton and Spybot, Norton looses.Hope this keeps someone else from wasting their money."
2,Not worth the hype!!!!,"I bought this product, hoping that it would be a much better version and versatile than its predecessors. Compared to NIS 2006, NIS 2007 isn't intuitive and doesn't have much of customisable features. Ad-blocking and Popup-blockers have been removed from NIS. You can't specify this product to block particular internet sites as opposed to NIS 2006.I am not that impressed by this product anymore as it does nothing more than slowing down your machine."
2,2007 version is different from 2006,"I have been using Norton Internet Security since 2001 and fairly satisfied with it. However I am disappointed with the 2007 version.1. Parent control and some other options are bundled into an Add-on Pack. The documentation that comes with the software did not mention that. I had to use online chat with tech to find out where the download is. The download is free.2.This version of parental control does not have the feature to create/map Norton users to your Windows XP users. The parental control of 2007 is global per computer and cannot map out a different URL access list for each individual computer user. I have two kids and their URL access list is different from mine and my wife's. I chatted with the online tech help and they told me that Symantic removed the feature in 2007 because of ""Security Concerns"".I would really be serious to review products from other vendors next year."
3,"OK product, but slows computer down","I've used Norton products for years, but this latest version will prompt me to look elsewhere at renewal time. The intall went fine, have had no serious problems due to viruses, etc., but it has noticeably slowed the computer down; this is especially true on startup. Even though I selected to not run LiveUpdate automatically, it still runs it every time. It's also running a scan (or something) that consumes enough CPU time that it will take Internet Explorer a minute or so to load. A couple of competing products note the slowdown in their ads so I suspect it is a common complaint."
3,Live update has stopped working,"When I run live update, I constantly get the following error. I googled this error. Many other people are getting it:LU1812: A program that was part of this update failed when it ran. This update was not applied.Installation failed, error summary...LU1806: LiveUpdate downloaded all of the updates you requested, but all of them failed to install. Please try to get the updates at a later time."
1,Symantec violates their own EULA,"I had been a satisfied Symantec customer since Windows 3.1. However, I recently tried to reinstall this product after having reinstalled Windows on a computer I purchased it for. (I had bought 3 licenses for 3 computers) Reinstallation is completely blocked by their activation process. Two hour long calls to Customer Service and a contact to email service all told me to buy another license. ""Please note that, as per End User License Agreement (EULA), one license = one installation on one computer. However, Symantec understands that user may need to re-install the software in case of hard drive failure, etc,therefore, it has provided 2 extra licenses. However, our server indicates that these licenses have been used. Hence, I recommend you to purchase a new copy of the software at an upgrade price."" They don't let me reinstall! Even with a valid license! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. And Symantec, say goodbye to another previously loyal customer."
1,Crash,"I just finished reformatting my hard drive because Norton crashed it. It did not want to install on Vista even though it is supposed to but with special three page instructions it did. I am telling you after two hours with dell fixing the damaged windows system the reformatting and loosing all my info was even more fun. Onecare works great, McAfee OK, Avast which is free works good. Trend Micro is one of my favorites. Just don't pick this one, it's not ready for Vista yet."
3,Have a fast computer to use this program,"I loaded this on 2 computers with no problems (other that slowing the system down a little it worked fine) but loading the last computer had errors that I had to work on for 2 days with Norton tech svcs. The program still doesn't work perfect yet. It won't update or run complete system scan. I feel it does protect the computer, for now. My wife wants to go back to 2006 ver it works better without error and system runs faser. I hate to have to purchase 2 ver to take care of 3 computers."
5,"Good product, great price!",Good product and great price. Still believe in Symantec for my anti-virus products. Shipping was slower than expected but product with multi-user features is great.
1,This program could wipe out your OS,"This is what happened to me:1) I installed it;2) Outlook and Word stopped working, giving me an error message;3) I uninstalled Norton ISS 2007;4) Disaster strikes: (a) Windows XP was reverted back to its initial form, (b) all programs inaccessible although still on HDD, (c) My documents wiped out!!!!!!!!!!! It was reverted back to its original state with all the sample picture folder and stuff.If you try ruunning this product, at least back up everything first. For me, this product is the VIRUS, it crashed my whole OS, deleted all my documents, and make my computer crawl like other users report. This is the worse virus.Good thing I got my refund because they have 60-day return policy. Bet they dare not call me for the reason because they could get law suit from this type of unacceptable product.Again - backup stuff before installing. Better yet, just use a normal Antivirus program and be careful with where we browse."
1,Very poor performance,"I have two desktops, one running Win XP (Dell Dimension 4600, 2.8 Ghz, one running Win Vista, 2.4 Ghz dual core). I ran the full scan starting at the same time on both using Norton Internet Security 2007. The XP version scanned almost 600,000 items in less than 2 hours. The Vista version is still running after almost 8 hours and has managed only about 233,000 items. The Vista PC is normally a fast machine. It seems that Norton has some work to do to take advantage of dual core technology. Had I known it was going to be this slow (not the first time, either), I'd have opted for ZoneLabs. Zonelabs also found spamware that was not detected by Norton. Granted that it was low-risk, but Norton should have found this kind of stuff as well.I'd probably look more carefully next time before buying a security suite."
1,The Worst AntiVirus EVER,I purchased this as an upgrade to my antivirus protection and it has been the worst mistake and the worst software I have purchased in 10 years! My computer is only 1 year old and it slowed performance to a crawl. I tried with no success to disable several components that were causing problems which Norton does not allow. I finally uninstalled the program and tried to go back to a regular AntiVirus but guess what it left remnants of the firewall installed and I could no longer use Internet Explorer to access the internet.
1,Amazon erased all the reviews 7/17 Do not buy this junkware,"This program is terrible,but by amazon erasing all the reviews you may be fooled into buying this Dont buy it and file a complaint with amazon for censorship of the truth...Update 7/19/07 The reviews have been restored,but install at your own risk! I would not recommend this program to my worst enemy. Like norton antivirus 2007 and norton 360,you may suffer system crashes computer damage,or a virus that norton misses. Avoid! You have been warned."
1,Most Annoying Software Ever,"I received Norton Internet Security as part of a new HP system. I am not impressed. Fact, is certain viruses are less annoying than this software. As has been noted, Norton Internet Security is annoying in that it reminds you every day to ""renew now or later"". I have a thirty day free subscription and feel that I'm bugged to death or being Blackmailed. In addition, I often receive MORE popups with their ""matters needing attention"" which includes subscribing again. They make the box to click off the popup really small. Today this box became a zombie process and it couldn't be clicked off. Thanks, Norton. In addition, I'm not sure why paying for a piece of software shouldn't get me the same results as free anti-viruses such as AVG and Spyware doctor. Both of them have found viruses that Norton has missed on my system. Norton does more than anti-virus, but they also charge more. Don't reply to spam in your mailbox and don't encourage Norton by buying their harsh shrill."
2,Troubled,I would recommend purchasing the Symantec Anti virus Only.Vista blocked the administration panels. A later updatecorrected this problem.System performance suffers due to the high loads on the system.
2,Norton Internet Security,"This product seems to protect my system which is it's purpose, so I give it a 2 stars. However, it slows it down horribly. I can't believe how long it takes -- for example -- to simply load Microsoft Word or Excel.Also there is no free support.I had neither of these problems with McAfee, but I need to use NIS to see how it affects my website pages. When I turn on the optional ad blocking feature, it inserts code into them and crashes them."
3,Internet Security 2007,"The protection features are all there and seem to work. However, extra steps needed to be taken to install the parental controls. Additionally, the various screens are not as easy to follow as they were in the 2005 version."
4,One of the best internet security suites,"I have been using Norton antivirus/internet security since I had my first computer at 1998. I rarely had any problem with it. This year I wanted to try other companys (zone alarm, McAfee), but they all froze my internet connection. McAfee is definitely has problems as you can see the reviews for it. Zonealarm free vesion was working fine on my laptop but I changed to NIS as well. I think overall, Norton internet security does what it is supposed to do. I wish it had wireless security as well (McAffe wireless home security is what I am using for that purpose, and is working great). I give it 4 stars as it lacks wireless security. 3PC version, antivirus, antispyware and firewall makes it a nice and complete working package."
2,Thanksgivig Turkey - Buyer Beware,"Horrible installation problems...Haven't had so much trouble since 1995. Now it has to be re-activated every day when I boot up the computer. I've spent hours on their live chat and e-mail support talking with people who don't understand english and trying the ""canned"" fixes that don't work. It is a 3 license CD and it does the re-activation stunt on both of my computers. Somebody at Symantec needs to be FIRED on this one. BEWARE OF THIS TURKEY! Keep 2006 and upgrade. Read the other reviews here for a host of other problems. I've been using Norton for years...2007 is an insult."
1,NIS 2007 load issues,"Norton Internet Security 2007 load was terrible. I used the program remove tools to remove NIS 2006. The load went ok until I tried to update the virus protection. I would not update and said my subscription was expired, even though the NIS 2007 said I had 366 days left.I went to Norton tech support and loaded a patch to fix this problem but did not work. Still said my subscription was expired. On line chat went through all my t/s steps again and finally sent me a new NIS program (I think it may be NIS 2008) and this fixed my problem. I had read alot of horror stories about this s/w but figured others did not follow instructions on removal of old s/w or HW requirements. But not the case this s/w was not properly validated."
2,Norton Internet Security Suite,Very disappointed in this product. Had to uninstall and reinstall MANY times during the 1 year subscription.
2,No no no,I recently upgraded to 2007. Huge mistake. Spam filter now gone and I am back to getting hundreds of junk e-mails a day! 2006 worked fine - but slow. 2007 is a huge steo backward.
1,Norton Internet Security Suite 2007 SUCKS!,"All the useful and important features regarding ad blocking, cookieshandling, blocking programs from accessing the internet etc... are allGONE! It seems that Norton has either succumbed to pressure from onlineadvertising companies or wanted to make extra profit on the expense ofits customers. I've been using Norton since 1999 and it was great, the2007 is horrible compared to its predecessors."
1,Dangerous!,"I bought this product to update 2006 Norton Internet Security. Three days after I installed it, the computer shut down with a message stating that the recently installed software conflicted with Windows. After several attempts to restart, my computer is now at a Computer Doctor store hopefully being fixed by a technician. This product was a lot more expensive than I thought.I don't know what product I'm going to use now but my advice is to run away as fast as you can from Norton!!!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"BEWARE!!!This 2007 version is full of bugs and will slow your computer down to a snail's pace. Also, when uninstalling the product, it removed the Internet Explorer from my computer. Apparently, Norton uses their own version of Internet Explorer (looks just like IE 7) except with a bright green ""Fraud Monitor"" bar across the top. It was an easy fix however...just go into Add/Remove programs and re-install the Internet Explorer component and everything is back to normal. I must say that this is a very disappointing product. I have previously been a loyal consumer of Symantec products since 1999! AMAZON.COM is Awesome!!!"
1,Worst Norton Ever!!!!,"For far this security suite is the worst I have ever try, transforms your system in a really slow system, I use to use Norton products but not any more."
1,256MB not enough RAM,"The specs for this product say 256MB is sufficient to run this software. It might be sufficient if it is the only software on the computer (especially since Windows XP requires more RAM than older versions). Just like the guy with 2G of RAM, my computer has slowed to the point of being non-functional. To keep it from freezing, I turned off automatic Windows and the suite's live update. Kind of defeats one of the reasons for having a security suite."
1,Norton Internet Security Headache 2007,"Nothing but trouble with this. Causes my computer to freeze at any time and can't be shutdown except by turning off power. Note the $29.95 fee for phone support. Thats bull! I spent 4 hours one night with online support (over two hours to get connected with someone) but still didn't get it resolved. Finally just had to uninstall the software, then stll had problems to resolve. There MUST be better stuff than this. I'm not likely to buy another Norton/Symantec product."
3,Ok,"The service that Amazon provided was great no doubt about that. The product itself is good, but I have been having issues with it. It has happened to me twice that Norton tells me that my subsription was over and I only had like like 290 days of it left. Then it wouldn't scan for spyware and virus... I was able to fix it, but it was kind of annoying when it happened."
3,Very confused,"I have used Norton products for years in almost all of my computers. Most have had Norton software pre-loaded. I decided to purchase this time and my decision was largely based on a rebate that was offered through Amazon. After sending in the original proof of purchase and Amazon receipt, Norton responded by email saying the proof of purchase was not included and I am not due a refund. I have written to their customer service several times without any response. Although I am trying not to let their poor service cloud my remarks on their products, I am having difficuty. It's the principle of it. No refund means no more Norton products for me any more."
2,Poor installation support,"As typical, Norton cannot even unistall its old version properly. After 3 installations and machine crashes, needed to download a special Norton removal tool and do it one more time. My suggestion, use this tool to remove all norton products first, also if you use Sonic Recording, update the software first, there is a DLA incompatility problem.Also this version is a real process hog!!! BEWARE"
1,BAD SOFTWARE,"My sister and I both had Norton Internet Security. She was having problems on her computer because Norton was disabled. When she called tech support, she had to pay $99.95 to have them check the problem and remove some trojans and adware. After working with 4 different tech support people, they still didn't get all the trojans and adware.She finally took her computer to an IT person who found 6 Trojans and 3 adware files!!After removing them, the IT person ran a Norton scan, as it suddenly became available to open and use after that. The Norton scan gave a ""no virus and/or spyware found"" notice. He ran some more scans from free software downloaded from CNet and found 3 more trojans!!I am dumping my Norton Internet Security and going with a different software.Plus, want everyone out there to know this horror story and USE NORTON AS YOUR OWN RISK!"
3,Parental Control problems,"I've been using Norton products for 10 years or more. I've always been very happy with them. Had some problems last year with NIS 2006, but they were fixed when I did a restore of Windows.NIS 2007 changed one of my most important aspects - Parental Controls. For the past several versions, you could have varied levels of restrictions. I've got teens and elementary aged kids, so I've had three levels of access. My teens get to see some sites that my younger kids can't, and I get to go anywhere. Multiple account settings in 2006 allowed this to work great.NIS 2007 (as well as Norton 360) simply have an OFF and an ON. No individual settings at all. A major change backward that wasn't indicated anywhere in the literature or on the website.I'm returning it so I can rollback to NIS 2006 and just renew my subscription."
1,Problems and Frustration,"I just installed Norton Internet Security 2007 and have had a headache with LiveUpdate and now some glitch with Norton tracking my correct subscription information.I now have a message that my subscription has expired. Again, I have just installed the 2007 Norton Internet Security. What's wrong with this picture?Are many of Symantec's customers having the same problem?"
1,Problems on an in office server,"User beware! I installed Norton Internet Security 2007 on the office server and had headaches with client connectivity. Despite appropriate settings connections were much slower and at times impossible. Server runs XP and clients Win2000. Finally decided to uninstall. That is another big headache and was almost impossible. While I use Norton antivirus protection, I would think twice about using this product unless you are willing to put up with the problems it can give an in office server situation."
4,Improved,"This suite has really good junk email filtering, and as always no problems with viruses. This version is not nearly as big a hit on performance as past versions of Norton products. I'll stay with it for awhile. The reminders to run a system scan are very annoying and can't be turned off. The worst part is that the system scan takes a long time, so I finally set it up as a scheduled task in the night. So far, so good."
1,I switched,I used Nortons for quite a few years but then I started to develope problems....My system seemed to slow down and I had trouble updating...Took out Nortons and installed AVG. for FREE and have had NO PROBLEMS since..When the FREE AVG runs out I will install AVG permentally...I now know why AVG gives you a year free...Very good product....
1,Beware of False Rebate Offers!!,I can't really complain about the product itself. I have been using Norton Internet Security for several years without any complaints. The problem is that they had a $20 rebate for this product which they refused to honor and because of this I will no longer purchase another Norton product. There are other security programs out there that will work just as good or even better and hopefully they will not be dishonest with their customers!
2,WARNING: Incompatible software packages,"I've been using Norton Internet Security for three years and had earlier versions of other Symantec products. I'm generally happy with the protection I get. However, whenever a user interface is involved, they haven't a clue. I endure because I need to be protected.I'm running NIS 2006 and when the nag screen started appearing I ordered NIS 2007 (3-user). When I went to install it, I got a message that both Spybot and Counterspy were running, that they were incompatible and that I would have to remove them - not just stop them from running during installation. Most articles I've read about anti-spyware packages recommend that your run at least two of them. Not possible here.Not sure what I'll do. Strongest inclination is to toss NIS in the trash."
5,Who's Who in Hell will make you laugh out loud.,"Who's Who in Hell will make you laugh out loud, make you think, make you amazed at who is a non believer in our big old world of faith."
5,The All-Time Best Book on Sex,"Why this book is not better known is beyond me. Lowen wrote it decades ago, and it still is far ahead of anything else written to this point on the subject.His views of homosexuality may clash with today's world, but the essence of the book is full of humanity and deep insight into the nature of love. I can't say enough about this book. It is a gem of pure beauty."
1,Dated (VERY!!),"This is an interesting artifact. It provides examples of the stereotypes prevalent in the 50s and 60s. Dr. Lowen presents (jargon term) his theories giving full credit to Dr. Freud. As you're likely aware, Dr. Freud's opinions were discarded decades ago.I recommendFor Yourself:The Fulfillment of Female Sexuality. Written in 1975, it offers clear advice and instruction on masturbation, orgasm, intimacy, and communication with/between partners. For Yourself was recommended by a sexologist to a female friend who had never experienced orgasm. My curiosity piqued, I read it with interest and was impressed with its quality. Comparing these two books had me wondering if sex/love-making changed that much in a decade?"
4,Nice book,"I do like this book and I'll probably refer to it often but I'm not quite as enthusiastic about it as the other reviewers. The history was very interesting but because there was so much of it, there wasn't as much coverage of suitable plants as other books. On the plus side of that, the author also didn't go into ""information overload"" and provide umteen-zillion varieties of every possible rose that could be planted. He did discuss some rarely used plants that I definitely want in my garden and he knows how to grow them, too, which is a plus. He also included some recipes for some of the unusual vegetables. And the pictures are wonderful."
1,Card does not work; no mfr website,"This card does not work with Win XP SP3. Recognized USB as 1.1 and NOT as 2.0 with drivers chosen by Microsoft and the disc that came with the card doesn't address XP at all. Further, the Sabrent website has a homepage only and all links are non-functional."
2,"Good for adding firewire, not so great for USB.","I bought this to add some USB ports to my laptop after one of the two onboard ports broke and shorted out.This adapter requires 1 USB port for additional power. Included is a power cable that plugs into both a USB port, and the power connector on the side of this unit.What this means is that you'll effectively be gaining only one USB port.It works without using the power cable, which is a nice remedy but it emits a high pitched ringing sound when something is plugged into it. I managed to run my thumb drive on it, but it got louder when it was reading or writing data. Sometimes my thumb drive didn't get enough power and it would malfunction and get too hot to touch. It never broke anything though.After about 5 months of using it this way, it died, and I wasn't sad to see it go (I was sad about that twenty bucks, though).I guess I should've bought a hub instead."
3,it is good to have it for Firewire items,There should be instruction that say pug in the small cable to make it work but it takes up another USB port of the laptop so you only gain 1 USB port I wonder if they make a PCMICA card with just 1 firewire port
1,poor product,"My only bad purchase on Amazon so far. No manual, no instructions. No drivers for Win 7 (though the package claims it is Windows 7 compatible). Worst, it constantly freezes the computer when trying to detect a new device, forcing ha hard re-start. Went straight into the trash can. Not worth trying to send it back."
1,sabrenet SBT-PCA4 4Port,"Worst gadget i'have ever purchase.Next day i throw this item to the GARBAGE bin.Very bad.Don't buy itwlodek pirek, new york"
1,Not a good option for external USB 2.0 devices,"I bought this device in hope to extend the capabilities of my Thinkpad A31 laptop to connect with my laptop. I have never gotten it to work properly, and even when I contacted technical support, they mentioned that the PCMCIA card did not have enough ""power"" to properly recognize the iPod or the other external hard drive I have. I tried it on another laptop (a Dell D600) with no luck there either. Do NOT recommend for purchase. Big waste of money."
1,Useless piece of junk!,"I bought this for the Firewire capability to link to my old Sony Vaio XP SP3. No instructions supplied which is not done! The drivers on the supplied CD did not work. The drivers off their web page did not work. My laptop recoginized the card as a VIA enhanced USB device but would not read anything attached to it, both USB or Firewire!! It's gone in the trash!"
4,More than you think,"Bear is more than just a story about a woman on an island, interacting with a bear. It is about a woman who finds her place in life, her life wants and goals, and her tracks to her life journey. This is about a woman who was headed in the wrong direction--leading a drab, boring life, a life that seemed to be controlled by the affair she was having. She takes a trip to a historical house on an island in Canada and finds that it was more than she had ever expected. Her life change and new attitude was fueled by a sexual relationship. It is more than just a sexual relationship--she finds out how to love herself and love others as well. Bear is an interesting tale filled with sadness, love, and truth. This story needed to be written and needs to be read."
4,Works great with Treo 600,I have tried several headsets with my Treo 600. This one from Palm One seems to work the best. The headset speaker is clear and the microphone is also very good. Its also comfortable to wear. I would highly recommend getting this original Palm One Headset for your Treo. Go for it.
5,Great Camera,I bought this camera as my first digital camera. It has been a great first digital camera. And has mostly replaced my video camera as well - since it captures video at 640x480 @30fps. If I could do it over again I would have bought the next line of camera up from this one - because whereas this one capture video using mjpeg - the higher line of cameras from Samsung offer 640x480 30fps video using mpeg4. What the this means is - that instead of being able to capture about 30min of video on a 512mb SD card. You could capture about 2 hours of video on a 512mb SD card at nearly identical quality. All in all this is a great camera.
5,Very useful,I bought 3 of these a year ago to use for groceries. They are still going strong. They are a lot easier to use and organize groceries in the trunk than with plastic bags. Also good for the environment.
2,Get it if you like what you're hearing,"Some wonderful song titles, but the band sounds like it has run out of ideas. Not to dismiss the great riffs on this CD, but be advised -- every previous Fudge Tunnel release (+ ""In A Word,"" the mop-up CD that followed this one) should be purchased first."
4,try and top this,The Complicated Futility Of Ignorance just goes to show you how far these guy's have grown as musicians. The drums are stomping and violent with alot more depth and a more open sound. The guitar is thick and distorted with riffs that leave you wanting more.The bass is fat and ripped a hole in my new speaker. This is Fudge Tunnel's Last full length album and one of there best. If you like Fudge Tunnel you will love this one.
4,Does work done,"I have no complaints to this memmory chip. Works great. 1GB is filled within less than 3 minutes, faster than burning a CD. The only thing is that this memory is thick. You will not be able to plug it in if there are no two vacant USB plugs. I solved this issue buying USB cable extension. That's why 4 stars."
3,Just a Jump drive,It works well in most situations. Moving files from various computers around the office. My one complaint is that the flash drive won't fit into a usb slot on a panasonic toughbook.I have to use a generic usb male to female adapter with the tough book.Every other computer it has no problems interfacing with.
2,Gay Productions,"Story of the Leopold and Loeb murder.............had a very gay bent, even though these two were homosexual,the theme was suppose to be about their psyches and the trialwith the 82 witnesses, famous psychiatrists, Clarence Darrow andthe judge and states attorney....lots of short cuts, used a push buttonphone in early 1920's...sorry, was not invented yet.Was disappointed, but, was not a disaster."
4,Great black and white/brutal irony,"I was really impressed by the quality of this film, particularly considering its budget. Good black and white shooting is nearly lost in my opinion but apparently the photographer of this one had studied his Earnie Haller and Leni Refenstahl. I also found it highly ironic that in this retelling of the story that Leopold and Loebe escaped death due to a lack of understanding of homosexuality. They were declared mentally deficient by virtue of phrenology and old freudian neurosis. Had the establishment of the 20's understood homosexuality, Leopold and Loeb would surely have hanged, for they were guilty as can be. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this film was. When it came out, any film with a gay theme got a good review so I have avoided the late 80's and early 90's gay movies. This film was quite the exception. Very good."
3,FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE,"The now almost forgotten true crime story of Leopold and Loeb, two young men convicted of murdering a boy just for the sake of killing and seeing if they were smart enough to get away with it. Leopold and Loeb were both geniuses who felt they could outsmart the law, and they employed the famed Clarence Darrow as their attorney, but even he could not save them. Swoon is a mid 1990s black and white version of the story which plays up the gay angle of their story a lot. The 1950s telling (Compulsion, starring a very young Dean Stockwell) leaves out any hint of a homosexual relationship, and really the story of the crime is told more effectively in the 50s version. Swoon is all right, and exposes an aspect of the Leopold and Loeb story we did not see in the 50s or in our high school history textbooks, but it is not the definitive film of this heinous crime."
3,Trying to be all things to all people,"It turns out to be mediocre to everyone.Swoon feels something like a rather lavish PBS documentary with some stylized, artsy murmuring and elaborate costumes and sets (except for the rather glaring touch-tone phones.) As a documentary, it feels forced, and needs lots of narrative (""On July 15, we this or that and I felt this or that."") However it leaves out any attempt at an examination about why these two men behaved the way they did and what the shaping forces were that created these arrogant, outwardly-polite murderers.As a presumably entertaining movie, it lurches from one scene to another and lacks congruity and basics of story-telling (like a beginning or an end.) It is interesting, and there are glimmers of excellence, but mostly they get drowned out by costumes and smoking and narrative.Worth seeing, but not entirely successful."
2,Thinks it's funnier than most of it is,"This is worth listening to for a couple of absolute gems, but the hour-plus of uneven material needed a much more ruthless editor. I loved the punk sendups of ""This was a real nice clambake"" and ""Do you love me,"" the do-it-yourself hit record, and a couple of other bits. The musical quality and the mimicking of artist styles is dead-on throughout. But pervading the whole thing was a sensation that its creators thought that everything was way funnier than I found much of it. Parodies of things already parodies themselves, like the Prarie Home Companion bit and the WB cartoon bit, added nothing to the wit of the originals. The other reviewer who compared this to the Firesign Theater I believe was accurate (and I'm not a big FT fan); if you like them, you will enjoy this.Moe, get punk Rogers n Hammerstein and DIY Hit Record onto iTunes, and I will gladly download them."
5,Missionaries and,"Missionaries and colonialism go hand in hand. There is are many accounts of missionaries paving the road for colonial powers. Some of the teaching was that the kingdom of Africans was to be set up in heaven if and only if they would be slaves to whiles. Many twisted ideas. Missionaries are truly evil because they knew what they were doing. Many many missionaries were caught for pedophilia in Philippines and Thailand and other areas of the world. Two years ago, a child prostitution ring conducted by missionaries was broken in Peru...there are many examples of atrocities committed by missionaries around the world."
3,Neural software saves the day,"Gerry Rosen clearly has more problems than an ordinary joe should have to deal with. There's the wife he's lost, the deceased son's recurring memory, and the boss from hell. I enjoyed the characterizations, which are seen through Gerry's eyes. The images of St. Louis following a cataclysmic earthquake were compelling. And I was captivated by Gerry's palmtop which might well have been as wondrous as ""Box"" from ""Star Cops"" (except it didn't do searches quite so impressively). I'm most critical of Steele's choice of the military, first as rescuers, then as treasonous villains. Surely, there would be huge numbers of Paul Revere's out there to wise the public up to the coup about to happen. What's the Internet good for, otherwise?"
4,Jericho delivers...,"Steele weaves an imaginative story of government corruption and corporate intrigue with The Jericho Iteration. I wasn't completely satisfied with his characterizations of the AI. It seemed a bit too human in it's reactions, but Steele's style and tightly paced writing delivered the goods in the end."
1,"Can this really be the author of ""A King Of Infinite Space?""","This one is a real dog. The story line doesn't hold up. OK, St. Louis is wrecked. Where is the rest of the country? If S.L. is the only major city devastated why wouldn't it be rebuilt like L.A. after the quake? Don't any of the people in St. Louis have relatives in the rest of the country that they can go live with? Can ALL of the National Guard types be vicious thugs? Steele obviously has some unresolved issues with the military."
4,Winnie the Pooh Smartridge - Wonderful,"I am really happy with the winnie the pooh smartridge, this was bought for my 31/2 year daughter and she loves it. She will play for an extented period of time, gives me time to prepare supper. It is wonderful to watch her learning and have a great time doing it!! I would recommend this smartridge."
3,"Entertainment, Yes - Educational, No - a review of Pooh Smartridge","If your four year old child doesn't know his or her alphabet or shapes then maybe this smartridge could teach them something (assuming they have good hand/eye coordination), otherwise it's just entertainment.Three Stars. 'Safe' proto-XBOX entertainment. Educational value: low. Even my 3 year-old son wasn't challenged."
3,A good buy for your toddler,"My 4 yr old son enjoys playing the games. We have a PS2 in the house, so no more fighting with him to get off that. He seems to understand well enough, but I wonder about how much he is really learning from the game."
4,great for younger kids!,"I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday. She loves it--it's a game she is able to do, and learning that is at her level. Some of the other games even when they say 3-6 years, etc--it is sometimes too difficult for her. Even my 5 year old son loves it--he especially loves helping his little sister figure out problems."
4,so happy with pooh!,"thank you amazon for posting so many helpful reviews for the vsmile. with so many different cartridges to choose from, the reviews were very accurate and helpful. i bought pooh for my four year old son, and it is very age and developmentally appropriate. pooh is adorable, and there are many fun games to choose from. i definetely recommend pooh for a first-time player."
3,Short but sweet.,"I probably wouldn't have picked this disc up, but since i was accused of being the Witchfinder General, I did. It's a simple EP, but the title track is well worth it, and the others I like also. To my ears it's typical light metal, though some call it doom-metal, I guess it does have an overall dark vibe to it. ""The Devil's Summit"" is the weakest and longest track, it does have horns on it, so what out for that. This is far from being essential, but if you're a fan, or it's dirt cheap, or your name is also Hopkins, give it a shot."
3,Buy it because its Cathedral,"This is pretty long for an EP, because like both of the other Cathedral albums I own, it's got a very long song on it. I can't complain about any of the songs, but track 5, The Devil's Summit, is pretty bizzare. It's doom/funk complete with Cathedral's trademark guitar tone backed by saxaphone. The album is easily worth the buying just for the title track which is great. Then it has a decent short song in ""Fire"", then a decent instrumental in ""Copper Sunset"" track 4 starts out like an 80's New wave song before the doom takes over. Overall it's pretty decent, just make sure you pick it up cheap. It's reccomended so long as it's under $10."
4,Oooo. The best Ben Jauary ending yet.,"I won't give away the ending -- I'll just say that I found this book to be very satisfying. The plot twists and turns were unexpected and I didn't see them coming. After reading all the books in this series, I had begun to ""know"" the characters and how they could be expected to act -- this book presented new character dimensions in behavior and perspective.Great read, I can't wait to crack it open again next year!"
4,Up to the usual standard...,"All too often writers seem to lose interest in a series after the first few books. The characters become settled and the plots are rehashes of what's gone before. Hambly has managed to avoid this trap; the characters are still growing and changing, and I care just as much for them after reading this book as I did after the first one. My sole objection, and I admit it's a petty one, is that my favorite supporting character is out of town - but the increased attention to Lt. Shaw gave me a whole new respect for the character."
3,The Political Thought of an Extremist - A Useful Primer,"""Milestones"" is a valuable primary source for the study of Islamic fundamentalism in the 20th century. Qutb's arguments present the flaws and vigor of extremist thinking: his ideal society is poorly delineated, and his desire for ""freedom"" clashes sharply with his desire to violently silence those who disagree with him. Furthermore, Qutb's notions of the inherent corruption and bankruptcy of man never manage to escape the reality that even in a ""divinely ordained"" society, the agents and authorities of its execution wil always be human beings."
2,Useful as a window into religious totaliterianism,"I'm divided over how to rate this book - on its twisted hair-raising totaliterianism or its value in giving the English speaking reader a window into this mindset. The Orwellian logic is the most startling. ""Freedom"" is defined as serving only God. Islamic freedom does not include the freedom to dissent or live in anyway contrary to the norms of Sharia, which Qutb defines in all-encompassing terms, controlling ""political, relationship, social, and economic"" matters. One is ""free from coercion"" in terms of belief, but clearly one would not be permitted to act upon one's belief if it in any way contradicts Islamic norms. In theory Qutb is describing a kind of Islamic anarchism in which imperfect human authority disappears and is replaced by the direct, perfect rule of God. In reality, we all know, it would give everyone, Muslim or not, over to the whims of unchecked, absolute power in the form of an oligarchy of Sharia interpreters."
1,Poor quality...,This book came from india and looked nothing like the one pictured on amazon.com. The English was not properly written. The spelling was atrocious. I felt like a little kid translated it from Arabic into an Indian influenced version of English. I was disappointed with this one. I've never been disappointed by Amazon.
4,Milestones,I don't understand the hatred that Qutb has engendered. reading the reviews and the internet articles on him you'd think he was shaitan incarnate of course I am new to Islam but he presents logical well thought out ideas especially about the corruption of the West as well as the equally corrupt Arabic world. He is far from being a Leninist as one internet blog has called him as he is all about Allah and submission to Him. Read it for enlightenment.
2,Another opinion..,I bought this book after an interesting documentary on History Channel.It's worth to add an opinion on our recent difficult historical times..Reading it's never a waste of time..But I expected a different academic approach to the subject.
5,A Milestone in Contemporary Islamic Thought,"Best known as the founder of the Islamic Brotherhood, Syed Qutb lived and died the life of a martyr. Opposition to his radical views made him a political outcast in mainstream Egyptian politics, but on the grassroot level, he was widely embraced by the people. His later years were spent in solitary confinemet--a political prisoner. And it was during those days, that he wrote his most famous works. Milestones presents his political and religious ideology. It is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Islamic politics, and the tumultuous Mid-Eastern political era. I strongly recommend another of his books, :In the shade of the Quran"""
3,Not too impressed,"The magazine has one good article per month and for a year subscription I received 5 magazines and I am receiving renewal notices. Your subscription is almost up. Really, I should have 7 months left and havent received 1 in over month??"
2,They cancel you subscription w/o prior notification!!!,"This seems to be an interesting magazine for young professionals. Gives good insight on different industries, possible ventures which could be successful and general information which is good to know if you want to start something.Good magazine. Looking forward to reading my first issue.I had put 2 stars at first as it took forever to come but after reading the magazine I would give it 4 stars.. doesn't let me change the rating now. :-/======================================================11/1/08So I get an email saying that my subscription to Inc. has been canceled cuz they have exceeded subscriptions. WTF! Pay me back my money!!!"
3,Have not recieved a single issue . Ordered more than a month ago!,"I was hoping to get an issue from the 12 month subscription soon. Haven't received 1 for a long time. It has been over 1 month since I ordered it. Once I get it, I'll change my review."
1,Cheated by Amazon and Mansueto Ventures,"I took advantage of a subscription sale or so I thought. After 4 months and no issues received, I canceled the subscription and requested a refund of the $4.98. In return I received $1.00. Amazon customer service, no show. Magazine provider Mansueto Ventures customer service, no show.Now to get the full refund I have to waste time and contact the credit card company.Buyer beware of magazine subscriptions on sale on amazon."
3,"The ""People"" Magazine for Entrepreneurs","""Inc."" advertises itself as ""The Handbook of the American Entrepreneur."" Each issue offers anecdotal lessons from business leaders across a broad spectrum of industries and topics. Anyone looking for research or in depth analysis will generally be disappointed. I generally read it cover to cover to be sure that I do not miss anything of value. I find it a worthwhile read for times which call for light intellectual challenge. One might call it the ""People"" of entrepreneurs."
5,A Great Read,"Inc. is one of my favorite magazines. It has good, practical information for the entrepreneur and small business owner, as well as anyone who is interested in business. Unlike other business magazines that contain articles that are long and ponderous, Inc. doesn't waste your time with tedium.Its sister publication, Fast Company, is also good.Two reviewers gave this magazine low ratings because they hadn't received their first issue after 4 weeks. Look, it CLEARLY states: ""Availability: The first issue should arrive in 6-10 weeks."" That means the first issue should arrive between 1 and 2 months after the order is placed. It hurts to see a great magazine get a lower rating than it deserves because some people either can't read or can't do math."
1,"Was excellent, now mostly fluff","Used to be excellent magazine with practical advice.More and more of the content is now fluffy dream stuff.The businesses they feature are now almost all ones that depend on fashion and customer whim - cupcakes, T-shirts, micro-breweries - not sustainable businesses.Good columns are gone. The one good column left is by the wife of the man who built Stonyfield Farm yogurt - about how entrepreneurship affects your family."
1,Good luck trying to cancel!,"Tried several times to cancel! They offer discount to start, then ignore cancellation requests!! Charged card and refunded - then charged a few dollars? Then sent another invoice that shows I ordered again! Would not recommend an order for any magazines from this company!"
4,Great mag for business owners,"Product arrived sooner than expected. I've had an Inc subscription for a few years and always enjoy each issue. Good articles with business owners, how to improve your business and updates on technology."
4,Great for someone without much knowledge.,"I'm satisfied with this magazine because it has some news and articles in an easy reading style format that is understandable for someone who doesn't know much about businesses. I'm sure it'll be useful for small business owners just to look through and keep themselves updated on what's going on. But if you're hard core, you'll need something else to read."
2,Often Not Relevant,"We decided to try this magazine for a year, and did not renew. It seemed to us that the articles were often not particularly relevant to our interests as small business owners, and many were outdated or not particularly interesting as well."
4,"Great, believable book!!","A great book! Most books involving another intelligent being are much more simple than this one: the ""other"" is evil, we're the good ones. We kill it. End. ""SIRAT"" is different, far more realistic and when you've read it there's far more to think about!"
2,"LOVE RICKY, BUT...","I love Ricky Smiley's prank calls, but this CD left alot to be desired. It seemed that alot of the callers Didn't get upset or ""ghetto"" like the callers from his earlier CDs. Most of them began laughing at how ridiculous the calls were , which took away from comedy of it all."
3,Umbra 240464-410 Ollie 48 to 88-Inch Drapery Rod,"The item itself is ok, a few scratches here and there. But the way its package looked was bad. It seems it's been kicked around hundreds of warehouses for ten years. I was surprised that the item was not broken."
5,"Once you try these, you will never go back to plastic.","The horrible things they are passing off as toothbrushes these days made from plastic and rubber, are pathetic. Try these natural bristle brushes, and you will never go back. These feel really nice against your teeth, as opposed to that plastic/rubber crap. There really is a big difference."
3,"Good and sturdy,but....","This is really a good quality phone with some excellent features (such as the ablility to dial while the phone is on the hook); however, unless I just have not figured out how, it's a pain in the neck to erase prior ID's. I have to do one at a time and it's time-consuming."
4,Good wll phone,Good voice quality and nice features. only complaints are the ad did not mention 4 AA batteries required and no way to stop flashing light when a new call comes in except to erase the info on the phone.
1,phone not acceptable,"If you are selecting this phone for the caller ID function, don't buy it. You can not read the caller ID screen, even at the highest contrast level. Another annoying part of this phone is that when you returned the phone to its cradle, it gave a loud speaker feedback squeak. We returned the phone immediately."
1,Worst piece of junk EVER!,"Was not allowed to give this zero stars-so I begrudgingly gave it one. Here's why:I have owned several of these types of phones over the years. This phone is by far the worst of them all.I figured that being a Sony product, there should be some quality there. Especially at the higher pricecompared to other brands of this type of phone. Well I was totally wrong. I got past the fact that the caller ID display is miniscule.Even when you are right on top of the phone it is difficult to read. When the phone started giving me pager types rings for no reason when no one was calling, I contacted Sony and they had me do a reset function. Well this worked for a couple of weeks and then it started happening again. The final straw was the constant static that started happening. I contacted the company, they were useless, so I'm am throwing the phone in the trash. Do yourself a favor- DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
1,Worse purchase ever!,"I bought this phone because it was replacing the same exact phone we had previously, however after 1 month all you can hear when you pick up receiver is constant static. So much static we can't use it anymore. A waste of money thinking i was going to get Sony quality all i got was garbage."
3,Poor Caller ID,"This is a nice phone, sturdy. The only drawback is that the caller id even with backlighting is difficult to see. Anyone with poor eyesight will have difficulty reading the display. You must stand almost on top of the phone to see it. I bought it for the fact that it was a wall phone with caller id."
1,unreadable,"This review is by my father since the product was purchased for him.If I crouch under the phone I can see a display, but as standard wall phone height it cannot be read."
5,Best of the lot,"Quite simply the best comprehensive theatre history text available. In every new edition, Brock reviewed every word on every page, incorporating new research, new theories, and new opinions. He never just ""tacked on"" a new chapter every couple of years. The good doctor is careful to separate fact from speculation, and often includes alternate interpretations of the historical record.As other reviewers have noted, this text is best accompanied by Dr. Brockett's lively lectures. Unfortunately, since his death last year this is impossible. I found during my time at UT that Brock was a careful scholar, interesting lecturer, and outstanding mentor.Buy this book! It puts the others in my theatre history collection (Molinari, et al.) to shame."
2,Beware false idols.,"Some theatre students and teachers take this book for a theatre history bible of sorts. Unfortunately, this results in readers switching off their critical thinking skills and accepting Dr. Brockett's values and opinions as facts. The scholar makes history and Brockett's history privileges debated concepts such as ritual-origin theory and drastically undervalues accomplishments of othered groups such as 17th century English actresses. (They get a whopping two sentences!) While this book is good for pedestrian and generalized descriptions of major figures and events (from a 20th century perspective), it is far from exhaustive. Alternative historical theories are not given much thought and the author presents opinion and theory as empirical fact regularly throughout the text.God is dead."
4,Much smaller than expected,"It's smaller than expected but adorable. Mine also had a piece of wood broken off but all it means is that the large drawer comes all the way out instead of stopping (it doesn't look broken at all). The piece of wood had been glued on the inside (as a drawer stopper). The smaller side drawers have a metal piece that keeps it from coming all the way out, much smarter! If you buy this as a gift, I suggest you open it and remove all the little packaging pieces inside the drawers, the plastic around the horse and wind the back, (so that when the person receives it and opens it, it'll start playing and spinning without them having to wind it).All & all, glad I only paid $13., and not the full price. Check the dimensions and make sure it's what you're expecting."
3,Very cute,"It is very cute box, but it came broken, one of the little drawers didn,t come out, so I had to replace it. It was for a gift, good thing I check before give..."
4,Granddaughter loved it!,"This held together quite well and my granddaughter loved it (even when she played a little rough, it held together!)"
5,My five year old loves it!,"It plays the classic ""greensleaves"" and has four hidden drawers - perfect for a little girl to put her treasures in. She wants to fall asleep to the music, and I know she's going to take care of it for years to come. Great, great present."
4,Motown greats,I really enjoyed this album - all the great old motown songs that we sung along with and danced to are here. May I suggest that you take a bit more care with the track listing. 2 out of 60 correct is an abysmal bit of work.
2,Tunnel Vision,"Although this book is very well written, Philip Green takes a very shallow perspective on the whole picture. This book will anger even a mild feminist"
4,"Great for professionals, But survivors beware.","This book is a must read for people helping any child bearing women. As a survivor myself, I found much of the first half of this book to be a trigger. If you are a survivor, be careful. This book has some good chapters, but I would only focus on the ""self help"" parts and stay away from the rest of it. It's made for health care persons, not survivors."
4,Well-Played Praetorius,"This disc has been one of my many stops in the never-ending search for the perfect recording of dances from Terpsichore by Michael Praetorius. My conclustion so far is that there are several such, each perfect in their own way -- and this single disc, all alone and out-of-print and not previously reviewed on Amazon, comes close to joining the list. The Ricercare-Ensemble fur Alte Musik Zurich have a sound that leans toward that of the old David Munrow and Early Music Consort of London recordings: There are shawns and percussion galore, and crumhorns now and then, punctuated by the occasional solo lute piece. It's all excellently played, and while it may not consistently have the verve you can find on many of its competitors, I'm still holding onto my copy. Not as good as some, but certainly far better than most."
2,All the obvious insights and not much else,"I was hoping this remake would go beyond the obvious insights (North vs. South, Black and White) and offer something original. Some of the special effects are nice (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1), but if you're interested in this film just get the original and draw your own conclusions. There were a lot of unanswered questions in my mind, and this version just harped on the obvious ones over and over again."
3,DJ Spooky Birth of a Nation,"Having never seen DW Griffiths' film before I was glad to be able to see it through this 're-mix'. I guess I was expecting something radically different from the original, though this was not to be. With the addition of an ongoing commentary offering the writer's readings of Griffiths' film, and the addition of graphic interjections on parts of the action, the film seems to be otherwise in tact.My curiousity about the actual film was satisfied. If the orginal isn't all there (I haven't checked with any original) then there is certainly enough to understand what it was all about. I guess the music track also is re-worked as part of this artist's re-packaging.I didn't really ever want to spend money on Griffiths' film, but it seems I have done through this re-mix.If that goes to this artist to support further creative-critical experiments, then I guess that's OK."
2,Bland,"If you are looking for a book soley to help you lose weight, I am sure that this book would be helpful. However, if you are looking for food that tastes good, this is not the book for you. All of the recipes I have tried from this book are bland, boring, and very ""diet"" tasting. While the pictures make the food look inviting, the actual results are abismal. I would not serve this food to my family; they wouldn't eat it. I have several healthy cookbooks which have wonderfully delicious recipes, so I do not think that healthy food needs to taste this bad."
2,Good Start then nothing,"This story started well. I like Katrina Kaif and Imran Kahn. But after the intermission, it just went downhill. The scheming and shenanigans that were supposed to be funny and charming just fell flat. Both actors are better than the ridiculous plot that drove the movie to the end after the intermission."
4,How to discover a new band...,"At first I thought that I was getting an Evanescene album, but realized that it was not Evanescene after listening to it. I really do enjoy this band's music, a band which I have never heard of before. Talk about an interesting way to find a new band!"
1,bad labeling.,"Ok people don't be mis lead. I popped this cd into my cd drive of my computer and listened to it, a little stunned that Amy didn't sing the ENTIRE TIME.. thinking ok, weird. but when i ripped it, the information said that the ARTIST was SCORN and the ALBUM was EVANESCENCE. to all of those EVANESCENCE fans, do not buy this cd, its by the artist SCORN not EVANESCENCE. just a heads up."
3,elementary my dear,"it's very elementary so for a college or high school student it might be a little boring, but for someone who has never taken french or another romance language, it's a good introduction."
4,Bigger/Heavier than expected,"I purchased this product a few weeks ago. When it arrived and I opened the box I was surprised at its size. In addition to being tall (that I knew because of the description) it is big and heavy to move around. So far it has been working well and I am satisfied with it. However, if the buyer is an older person it is wise to know that you may have trouble moving it around.I wanted something tall and I don't really mind that it is bigger/heavier than I anticipated but someone else might.So far so good..."
1,Do Not Buy,"Not sure if this company still exists. No website found. After one month from purchasing, it stopped working. called toll free number, no answer."
5,Medication for different diagnostic,"The most important about this book is that specified the medication for the specific diagnosis, also give you all the information about it and what other symptons can you see with your primary diagnostic, to know if the kid need an extra medication or not."
4,lots of words and less drawings than other anatomy books of Hogarths,"Hogarth has a lot of history/words that really do not matter to me, and can be found almost anyplace else in art history. Many drawings are in his other books. I think this is a good book but seems more a cameleon of his other books all combined together with some 66 pages of history. I would pass on this if you need raw meat to learn his techniques, and order his other anatomy books."
2,Lacking,"I bought Hogarth's ""Dynamic Anatomy"" because I was impressed with his drawing style. Unfortunately, there is too much flash and not enough in-depth exploration of the body. Muscles follow the bones so it is critical to know the bones. Hogarth gives no attention to this. This would be a decent supplement to learning new ways to draw the human form. I might recommend it to someone that had firm knowledge of the body already."
3,Exceedingly specialist,"I was interested in buying a book called ""Dynamic Anatomy"" (who wouldn't be: surely something for everyone?) But this book deals with drawing knees and so on. Really, for artists only."
4,The Grand Master of Comic Instruction's Finest Hour,"Though Mr. Hogarth died only a few years ago, his magnificent legend lives on in his books. For many a day I despaired that I would never find a good anatomy book to help my comic book aspirations along, and finally I found it. Though His instruction often takes the form of difficult, intricately drawn models created almost mathematically (and this difficulty garners the 4-Star rating), the overall glimpses of the human form (especially the arms, legs, chest and back) and the anatomical detail make this book a true must-have for any aspiring artist in any field."
5,Great book for artists,The exagerated human forms in theis book really helps the artist draw the human body without the naked person drawing classes.
4,Good for muscular tension illustrations,"Hogarth's book is best as an aid in learning how to draw scenes with muscular tension, action scenes and depictions of strength. For more relaxed poses and typical anatomy illustrations, I recommend a life drawing book with nude models or even a life drawing class. Still, Dynamic Anatomy is a good reference and I highly recommend it."
5,sf at its best,"I expected to get a number of good science fiction stories. What I got was more than that. Almost 1000 pages of the very best science fiction, and at an incredible price"
5,Collected Stories of Arthur C Clarke,"This was fun to read. I have read many of these, but there were still a lot that were new to me. This man puts enough detail into his stories that they ring true, but they are still enjoyable to read. A great collection! As always, Amazon boxed well and shipped quickly."
3,Arthur Clarke,"As a snapshot of how science fiction changed in sixty years, this book is good. However many of the short stories with aliens that are insects, or have tentacles, just do not cut it."
4,A really good collection at a low price,"I picked this book up at a Half-Price bookstore for like $10, and it was completely worth it. Any fan of Clarke or any SF fan should pick it up. There are many grammatical errors and a few omissions, but all in all it is a very good compilation of Arthur C. Clarke's work. It has all the short stories that eventually evolved into novels(i.e.The Sentinal, Songs of a Distant Earth, Guardian Angel, etc.), as well as many of the amusing White Hart tales. It's big and bulky but if you can find it at a good price then grab it."
3,"Much-needed collection, but...","It was about time somebody collected all of Clarke's short stories into one volume. I looked forward eagerly to re-reading them (I wore out my '50s and '60s paperbacks of Clarke's stories long ago). Sadly, the poor copyediting ruined this book for me. Tor must have hired some minimum-wage illiterate to keypunch the stories, then neglected to proofread any of them. There are mispellings on every page (""BEWARD OF LIONS""), and whole lines (or worse) are completely missing from many of the stories! (A whole *series* of paragraphs was missing from one of my favorite stories, ""Superiority"".)I'm almost sorry I bought this book. You can buy it for its historical significance, but expect to be disappointed by its quality."
5,none,"The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke is a splendid and entertaining plethora of all of Clarke's stories to date. From the hilarious first forays into SF (the previously uncollected 'How We Got To Mars') through all of his classics (The Sentinel, Earthlight, The 9 Billion Names Of God, and Songs Of Distant Earth, to just name a few), and right up to his most recent 'Improving the Neighborhood'. Clarke, truly one of the originators in the field of hard SF, has, and always will, influence SF writers for generations to come... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet."
2,"interesting for history of sci-fi, but otherwise out-of-date","Clarke was a prolific writer. Some would say that qualifies as being a great writer, but I would say that putting out a high quantity of stories just fills the bell curve as far as quality of stories. Maybe it is because of the span of time over which these were written, but many of them read like episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" - and many more read like bad episodes of such.Reading these stories, you get a feel for where the seeds of other sci-fi stories came from, but often times, you are simply left confused (like the ending of ""The Star""), wanting a better ending (his endings definitely tend to be pessimistic), or simply laughing at the infantile writing while asking yourself, ""This is one of the greats of sci-fi?""Again, maybe it is just because sci-fi was in its infancy when he wrote most of these, but his prejudices and pessimistic elitist style too often cloud what could have been a decent story."
4,didnt buy,"This Is no Review Per Say I Just wanted To Chime In And agree With the other reviewer. I Was just at my local best Buy And With Tax a dynex Sata Cable Comes To 22 Dollars and change. YOud be desperate to Pay that. This one seems like A fair price, but I Just Bought A generic Two Pack For 4 bucks So Shop Around. Surr they Were An Add On Item But If You Have More than25 dollars Wprth Of merch In your Cart its No Issue :)"
4,Great stories of San Francisco,"If you like learning about different cities histories and how they have developed into the successful city that they have become today, this is a book for you. This book definately helps the reader understand the history of San Francisco and how it became a great city with many different componets. A city with excellent artist, journalist and even what the locals think the city is all about. This city in the autors words is a city with class. I really truly believe this after reading this book. However there isn't much direct wording from the author. He just gives you stories from other journals or writers that help you understand how this great city came about. This is a great book one should read it."
2,Doesn't smooth the way New Cuticles did,What was Sally Hansen thinking keeping this product and not keeping New Cuticles which actually helped?
1,Waste of time,"Adam's task offers an incoherent and ridiculously anthromorphized philosophical take on relations with animals. Her distain towards pet owners in general is an attitude likely to be unpalatable to most readers. The author believes that positive training, such as using treats in training a dog, will cause the dog to feel insulted and to 'lose respect' for the human. In lieu of positive training, she promotes borderline-abusive training, such as shoving a dog's head in a hole to reduce the dog's digging behavior. Don't waste your time with this one!"
1,Sadistic thuggery,"How sad to see this bit of sadistic thuggery reissued. This is a book about the poetic joys of torturing dogs. One sample: Hearne describes how she helped her dog dig a hole, while dancing playfully around with the dog, filled the hole with water, still acting playful with the dog, then suddenly, without any warning, forced the dog's head under water and subjected her to near drowning. What the dog must have thought of that hideous and incomprehensible betrayal I cannot even begin to imagine. And yet reviewers prattle on about what a lovely book this is. I think dogs would disagree. The book is also nauseatingly pretentious."
2,Too Academic,"I purchased this book in hopes that it could help me train my dog to stop certain bad behavior. I found the book to be an excellent referance book about dogs, but I found little direct, hands-on help in training my dog."
1,cruel and useless,"I have read dozens of books on animal behavior, communication, training and the like, and usually take away a useful lesson or two from even the less impressive ones. Not this time, this book mainly seems to serve the purpose of boosting the author's ego and her determination to display her own intelligence, education and supposed insights are longwinded and off-putting.However, the above would still not have moved me to leave a negative review if at times all this psycho-babble seems nothing more than a thin veil covering excuses for cruel training methods. Not a book for animal lovers!"
2,"Needs more common sense, less philosophy","Anyone who lives with animals knows they have emotions - no need to make a big philosophical thing about it. Just plain common sense would do it. I read part way through the book but stopped because it was so convoluted, so I didn't come to some of the parts others have described as cruel."
1,Completely Incompatible With SOE,"I bought this about two months ago with a SOE 90-Day Game card and did not attempt to use this until yesterday, finding out from their support that it is not recognized by Sony Online Entertainment, rendering this card useless."
4,Breath Stopping!,"This one had me holding my breath at times! It is very explicit. Two school chums Vicki & Joy are stranded on the French Riviera after they are robbed. Rather than return to a boring life at school in England, they decide to use their bodies to make a little money. However that's where things start to go wrong for them. They do get into some wild trouble, with sheiks, dwarfs, prostitutes, etc. Its is well written, but certainly not for the faint of heart."
2,doesn't live up to expectations,When I purchased this book I was expecting something along the lines of a love slave type book from the title. What I recieved was in my opinion a poorly written story that wasn't worth the time I spent reading it. If you are into dumb blonde type books I would highly recommend this book.
2,Lack of handle makes turning very messy,"I've had those composter for 2 years now. I did find that it produced a smell, so I moved it to the back of my property instead of near my house. This resulted in me not spinning it as much. But when I did spin it, it was seriously gross. The goo drips out of the bottom (like its supposed to), but when you spin it, the goo gets all over the composter and its very hard to avoid getting the hands dirty. Eventually animals chewed off the lock, so now I can't spin it at all. I still use it to throw out rotten food, and then dump it eventually in the woods.I'd recommend getting a composter that has a handle."
1,composter - not worth it,"I received this as a birthday gift 2 years ago. It doesn't seem to work as advertised. I turned it every day, added the required material (i.e, leaves, kitchen scraps, grass, etc.) and it did not produce the organic material it was supposed to. It was just one big huge smelly lump that turned over and over in the composter as I hand turned it. I'd say, look for something else. This ain't it."
1,Fake/Counterfeit,"There is no question this item is a counterfeit. Also, I found it cheaper at a department store. I returned it and promptly received credit by seller but was a waste of time. Another attempt at deceiving internet customers."
5,Love itt,"I love it to the core, the smell is just wow, like every other chanel, the smell is just different and you can tell by the smell that its chanel, :) The Smell is long lasting, thats the first thing i care about perfumes , is that the smell should last good couple of hours.. and it did :) Highly recommended"
4,A Review of Traitor Among Us,This book is full of suspense. There is a lot of historical facts about World War II in the Netherlands. This book is a great read for kids around 8 - 12 years of age. I highly recommend this book.
5,Mel Gibson reads David and Goliath,"It was delightful and entertaining to hear Mel Gibson read David and Goliath. With a slight Australian accent, Mel's reading is smooth and dramatic. If you are interested in stories of the Bible, you are sure to enjoy this well written story of David and Goliath, which closely follows the scriptural account."
4,A Must have!!!!!!!!!,"This is not just a text book approach to math for students. It offers teachers many options, ideas, and approaches to the math for students. It also provides reminders of the thought process and the math involved in given situations. I appreciated the ""review"" for me and therefore, for my students. Things I would have taken for granted, I now realize must be reviewed for the students. Thank you."
4,I didn't find it dry,"Two reviews called this book ""dry"" or ""sterile,"" but I don't agree. It is concise and clear, without bells or whistles in the prose, but I found it elegant and even fun. It talks both about the math itself and about which points children often struggle with, and includes many thoughtful activities. I can tell it has been refined over long experience."
4,If you like Diatribes........,"of the newer work by ND, Diatribes is one of my favorite albums. This EP has two tracks from the album and 4 or 5 exclusive tracks including one of my favorite ND tracks of all time, Antibody. These other tracks were recorded at the same time as the rest of Diatribes. and fit in well with that album"
4,Features Exclusive Tracks,"Greed Killing is the 1995 EP released in support of Napalm Death's full-length albumDiatribes. This CD came at a time when Napalm Death's sound was somewhat closer to death metal (with some industrial elements) than the grindcore they helped create. It's still as brutal as ever, though slightly more accessible.The EP includes 7 tracks. Greed Killing and My Own Worst Enemy are taken from Diatribes. A live version of Plague Rages is also included. The remaining tracks are exclusive to this disc. All of them are in the Diatribes/Inside the Torn Apart/Words from the Exit Woundstyle.I won't go so far as to call this a must-have album, but Napalm Death fans are definitely going to want to pick up Greed Killing. Plus, a lot of Napalm Death CDs from this era were dumped on the market a few years back, so you have a decent chance of grabbing this disc for a couple bucks."
5,Best album ever!!!,There isn't one song i dont like on this album. Never dead is my favorite song. and i like saliva the next best.
5,Best mf doom to date,"I'm sorry, but this is better than ""operation doomsday"". If you like any previous doom projects, this is a must. completely original"
5,Futuristic Concept Rap,Doom is one of my favorite producers and you know that when you purchase one of his albums that your going to get a quality product this album is no exception. I did not like this when I first got it but it grew on me and is now one of my favorites. Doom has created an album that is dark futuristic and most of all beautiful. trying to draw comparisons to other Hiphop groups on this one is impossible because it doesnt sound like anything else out there this album is 100% original and that my friends is what Doom is known for taking the rawest beats and funny/nonsense lyrics and making a great album. you might read some bad reviews on this because in no way is this op doomsday part 2 but you should at least give this a listen because this is an all around classic that I have been listening to for years. 5 MICS
5,DOOM's best,"This is still MF DOOM's best album so far. Nice producton, especially from King Honey and Heat Sensor, nice guest appearances by M. Sayyid and Apani, and plenty of abstract rhyming from the villain. This and Operation Doomsday are his 2 essential releases."
5,MF Doom is the best rapper I have ever heard,"This album is one of the best mf doom albums i have ever heard on the same plateau as Operation Doomsday and Madvillainy. The most memorable line for me on the album is when doom says ""remember me god, clean tims wit emery board, he only came to save the game like a memory card"""
4,Excellent collection of songs and artists,"I have enjoyed this even more than my expectations from when I ordered it.Emmylou has given us so much great music, on her own albums and by adding her special touch to others, and this just sort of put some icing on the cake.I love it!"
5,"I Love You, Emmylou","After all these years, her style and voice are still the finest. She's right up there with the greats of all time. Give the gift of Emmylou to a new generation.Johnny HughesTexas Poker Wisdom"
5,Expensive but a great overall package,"Amazon service was great - package is expensive but you get alot. Much of the video is available online in various forms but not always at this quality. Some of the unpublished material justifies the purchase for me. Yes there is republished material but since I don't tire of listening to Emmylou, it is fine with me. Fine accompaning material. The box is covered with cloth that in my case had a couple of wrinkles but I care more for the songs than the packaging."
4,Buyer beware!,"I just received Songbird and was struck by the beauty of the package and the hardbound book with the songs, musicians, etc. (Didn't see any pictures of Emmylou with Gram Parsons.)However, when I got to the heart of the package (the cds and dvd), I just stared in horror at the packaging and am still trying to figure a way to get the cds out of their slots intact without destroying the packaging. Even cutting won't be easy.I cannot believe these geniuses who designed this packaging couldn't predict the problems. Obviously, they never tried opening the package once it was done.Incredibly stupid and another finger in the eye of the poor consumer. Shoddy jewel cases and now shoddy packaging (at top dollar).If I can ever get the cds out and can listen to them, will report back on the music.Right now it's back to figuring a way to access the treasures."
5,Emmylou's gems.,A beautiful collection of music from this prolific and gifted Americana artist. The songs are a delight and the booklet is revealing and informative. The only complaint I have with the set is that the cds are much too hard to remove from their sleeves.
4,Mostly already realeased and the packaging is horrible,"You can't go wrong with Emmylou BUT there really aren't that many unreleased tracks to make it worth the avid fan's money and enough can't be said about how difficult it is to get the bloody CDs out without ripping the ""box"". Falling is a Deep Hole is pretty awesome, though!"
1,Packaging will eventually destroy the disks--don't waste your money!,"Others have written about the lousy packaging that makes it very difficult to remove the disks from their sleeves, especially disks 2 and 3. I thought that, if I was careful, I wouldn't have a problem. I was wrong: the cardboard sleeves are so tight that removing and reinserting the disks will cause scratches on their surfaces that will eventually grow so deep that you will no longer be able to play the disks. Unfortunately, I discovered this problem after it was too late to return the cds.I'm a big fan of Emmmylou Harris. However, because of the destructive packaging, this collection is a big ripoff!"
5,Excellent,"For Fans of Emmy Lou Harris, this is a must.To be honest,I got this in particular to get the rare tracks with Linda Rondstat and Dolly Parton. I wasn't disappointed with those. Along the way, however, I discovered to my delight, the wonderful and quiet beauty of Emmy Lou's voice,and performance."
2,Still misses the mark,"I recently purchased this model for my daughter as a replacement for the original model which was leaking. We have a couple of the melitta javapod coffees but you can get much better coffee from other sources. At first we were very happy with this machine as it is much easier to fill, it is not as noisy, and seems to heat up more quickly. However, after only 3 months of normal use it no longer makes a decent cup of coffee. It comes out watery and she is using the strong 5oz setting.The manufacturer claims that only the javapods will work in this - but that is not true - even the melitta pods are malfunctioning. Several other pods are identical in size and shape and are much better in quality.Overall I have to say that although this is a fantastic idea, Melitta has missed the mark AGAIN."
5,GREAT POD COFFEE MAKER!!!! I'M SOOOOO EXCITED!!!!,"I just received my new Melitta One:One Single Serve Brewer(MES5B)and it is an amazing pod coffee and tea maker. I have used almost every pod machine out there, and this particular Melitta One:One is absolutely the best of the bunch, at an incredible price. The coffee comes out hot, just the way I like it. To top it off, it works with my favorite coffee pods from [........]. Arabica Express coffee pods work in the single pod holder and their larger Sensation coffee pods work in the double pod holder. I am absolutely thrilled about my new purchase!!!"
4,Works as advertised,"Works fine with pods or plain tea bags. Not perfect, the temperature of the water entering the cup is below 200 degrees but a good bang for the buck."
5,New Boy Scout Gift,"Our grandson just because a boy scout and we were so proud of him, that we bought him this knife.He loved it and was so thrilled with this gift.It's hard with teenagers to pick the right thing, but this was a winner."
1,Not as Advertised,"Nothing wrong with the knife except it does not have the Boy Scout emblem embossed on the handle as advertised. It's just a plain huntsman knife, which you can buy for a few dollars less without the scout emblem. Sent it back with this complaint and promptly received a replacement knife just like the one I sent back....no scout emblem. So I'm giving up and sending it back for refund."
4,A Little Disappointed,"The product was great, and given as a gift. Met expectations of the Victorinox brand. However, packaging was busted and scratched, and the surface of the knife had several scratches. Was rather embarrassing to give, because it appeared to be used on the outside. The tools, however had never been used. They were new and still oiled."
5,Wonderful product,Purchased as a gift for my nephew who is a 7th grade scout. He loved it and uses it for his excursions and projects. Had one in my Girl Scouting days. Still just as sturdy and reliable as they were 25 years ago.
5,amazing,This is an amazing knife. Would recommend to anyone I know. Use it all the time for everything. For Boy Scouts. It is also a perfect size for everyday use
5,Excellent Price!,"This is a very nice little LCD monitor. My daughter is very happy with it. I was leary about purchasing a used monitor, but for the price I thought I would give it a try. I have no regrets! This seller is very honest and ships quickly. A+++"
5,Stigma -How We Treat Outsiders by Gerhard Falk,"The Stigma book is the most thorough and outstanding book about ostracized/abused categories of people. It deals with the attitudes and treatment of the mentally ill;of homosexuals; of the obese; the ...developmentally handicapped; the old; and those belonging to minority races. It further describes resentment against achievement; the stigma of homelessness, that of prostitutes and folks who suffer from addictions including alcoholics. It describes how brutally criminals, xconvicts and former offenders are stigmatized and denigrated throughout the years of their lives. It is a must reading for all students of psychology, sociology and other human service professionals."
4,Classic 1980's miniseries frustratingly unavailable on U.S. VHS or DVD,"This sumptuously-produced 4-hours-plus miniseries, featuring Armand Assante and Jacqueline Bisset in the title roles (with supporting performances by Stephanie Beacham, among others) is one of these movies that are, much to the frustration of classic video fans, still unavailable on any form of home video in the U.S. even decades after their release. It's very much to be hoped that, now that the various ""vault"" series such as Warner Brothers' and Universal's are finally releasing long-neglected movies and miniseries on DVD, this one - like, for example, ""Lace"" and ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"" - will finally get its long-overdue release on DVD."
5,The best Napoleon series ever!,"I first saw this when I was 14 yrs old. Not knowing anything of history, mainly preoccupied with cars, trucks and tractors. Then I saw this on TV with my parents and it opened my eyes, to the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette, the British Regency and Napoleonic France. This TV series is made best by the amazing array of stars and their talent set against the backdrop of some of the most beautiful palaces in France.I have waited a long time for this TV series to be released on DVD and I was so impatient to get it that I paid for the next day delivery, which is something I never do!"
3,the movie was good until........,"one the DVDs broke in two after we had watched it a few times. I had thrown away all the materials necessary to return it, and we had watched it 2-3 times already, but it cracked for no apparent reason. Unusable at this point.....just want to add this was a very rare occurence with any DVD we have, as there are no kids in the house, etc., that could have abused it, it just broke!!"
5,Jewilious,"I heard excepts from this CD on NPR right before my sit-down Passover Seder of 30 of mostly non-jews. I began the explanation of the holiday with ""They tried to kill us, we survived - let's eat!"" Growing up Jewish, I find the humor both poignant and hysterical. It is now a Jewish Holiday classic in our house - right along with Havah Negillah, and Shalom Alechem!"
5,clear tract purchase,"I have purchased this product in the past and am very pleased with the results. Received quickly, no problems."
4,Excellent product delivered quickly,Clear Tract is a good alternative to cranberry and for me much more effective. I found it works best if used in the full dosage initially.
5,Works well for uti,Wish they sold it in bigger bottles. No taste. Effective. Really does work for uti's. What else can I say?
3,No Noticeable Improvement,"My elderly mother frequently gets UTI infections so we thought we would try the Clear Tract capsules. Unfortunately, after about 3 weeks on the product, she has another infection. So for her, I have to report there was no difference as a result of taking this product."
3,Clear Tract,"Although at first, I really thought this product was wonderful, it only somewhat relieved the symptoms of my U.T.I. After explicitly following the directions for taking Clear Tract, I discovered that my U.T.I. had gotten worse and I STILL had to go to my physician and get antibiotics. So, for me, I don't think it works that well. It would be good in an emergency - to alleviate the symptoms temporarily until one can get in to the doctor. But, it doesn't get rid of the infection."
2,Disappointed with Shipping,"I have purchased this product a few times, and I am very happy with this products results, it doesn't cure a UTI, but it does help with the pain. Beware of this seller, as I paid the extra money to have this product shipped within 3 days, and it actually took 8 days, and after numerous emails to the seller, I never received a response............"
1,funny service,"OK, I have been buying this product for 9 years and love itwas surprised to find it on amazon but very pleased as it seemed less$I ordered but it never camehad to make 2 phone calls around Xmas time and was told to contact the vendorthen out of the blue it arrived about a week after xmas"
5,It works,"I am prone to UTI's so take this about 2 or 3 times a week in my coffee. If I feel like I am getting a UTI, I will take it 2 or 3 times a day until the symptoms pass and then I go back to once a day for a few days and then go back to 2 or 3 times a week. I ordered it from another distributor a couple of months ago and on the label it said D-Mannose Formula and it laid on top of my coffee for a couple of minutes until it dissolved and it took longer to work so be sure the label says 100% D-Mannose in the orange strip across the top of the label."
2,Not For Old-Time Soapmaking,"This book is good for those who prefer to use the ""modern"" way to make soap, which is cold-processing. Why make soap in the first place if you are going to do it the simple way?True soapmaking is done by cooking soap, and this book has no information on that process. The book does give helpful hints about specifics on oils and herbs to use, as well as other soapmaking knowledge - but don't get it if you want specific information on making soap the traditional way. James Herschberger is the soap GURU when it comes to classic soapmaking."
3,"Lousy Recipes, Good Advice","Buy this book if you're planning on starting a store and selling soap. Otherwise, avoid it.The recipes are uninspired and uncreative. They're not bad, they're just not creative enough to grab someone who's enthusiastic about making their own soap. For that, I recommend the Susan Miller Cavitch book, ""The Soapmaker's Companion"".The business advice, however, is great. I really recommend it if you're interested in starting a craft business.And that, really, is the only reason to buy this book."
3,It's a good book that you'll outgrown quickly.,"This book is geared more toward hobby soapmakers than serious small businesses but it's a nice place to start. The chemistry is OK but not great. It DOES have a few nice pictures and the friendly, chatty style fits the author well.If you've never been in business before and you're really not looking to go into serious manufacturing this is a good get-your-feet-wet book. If you're an experienced business person who's just looking for a good lesson on soapmaking, pass this one up."
4,Great book,"This book is the best book that I have purchased pertaining to the soap making business. Though this book lacks on recipes, it is very informative on how to start your own business and it gives you vital resources to help you along the way. It is packed with alot of useful information. I recommend this book for those just getting started and thinking of starting a home based business making soaps or other crafts and don't know where to begin. This book is definately a must have!"
3,Interesting if you are into selling soap,I bought this book as a beginner soap maker and it was geared more to setting up a business. Even though it was not for beginners learning to make soap it has some good information.
3,Not so much for fun as for profit,"This book was very helpful if you are looking to start a business (the profit side), but really didn't contain a lot of recipes or instruction (the fun side).As I am moving toward starting my own soap mini-business, I found this book to be invaluable. However, I didn't find any useful recipes or ingredient ideas, and that would be important to a beginner. Therefore, buy it if you are entering the business stage, but not if you haven't yet mastered the fun!"
5,I Should Have Read This Book First!,"Maria takes the mystery out of soapmaking, and makes it fun! This book is packed with easy-to-follow recipies, helpful hints, supply sources, and safely guidelines. Maria's easy to read style takes you through the entire soapmaking process. She explains not only how to do each step, but tells you why that step is important, and how it all works together to make a great final product. If you are making soap for a home based business, for gift giving, or just for your own use, you will find something in here to help you. The book includes sections on pricing, craft fairs, and sales tips. I have tried making soap, with little success. After reading this book, I know I will now be successful. I should have read this book first............"
2,Rather dull...,"This book includes a number of recipes which instruct you to measurethe ingredients by volume. Don't, it is far to inaccurate.... Otherthan that the book is adequate but dull. There are far bettersoapmaking books around, for example those by Melinda Coss, SusanMiler Cavitch and Dr Bob McDaniel."
4,Chessie System Diesel Locomotives,"While there are a very few ""word glitches or text errors"" that I have noticed so far, I have to rate this book very highly. The photography is excellent and on par with other very good color RR books. TLC Publishing has come a long way and this book is well worth its price in my opinion. I recommend it to any Chessie fan."
4,Changing of the Paint,"This is a beautiful color picture book of B&O, C&O and Western Maryland diesels as they became Chessie diesels (and even several pics of them becoming CSX diesels later). Even the Appalachian scenery in the background of many pics is terrific. I added this to my Western Maryland collection as sort of an ""end of the WM era"" book, giving ""closure"" to my WM books and memorabilia."
5,Fantastic Shampoo,"When using this shampoo, you only need a little and it lathers a lot. It smells great and I have noticedthat is helps keep the color in my hair longer."
3,There are better options out there,"I have used Biolage since my first job in a hair salon in 1988. The Shampoo & Conditioner pair used to do a good job and were used in the salon as the ""house"" products. Recently I decided to try it again and the formula must have changed.This leaves my semi-fine hair feeling as if the moisture was removed from it, then sealed. So it's kind of coarse and resistant afterwards. At least that's my experience and I am using softened water.Also, the smell isn't that great. It smells like basic soapy shampoo - no fruity goodness."
4,Good Shampoo,"I find this shampoo does well on my long hair. Its fragrance is subtle. It rinses out well.I don't like the cap. It's too stiff to open easily, but there are ways around the problem."
2,Not the worst but not even close to the best...,"I USED to love this shampoo. When I was younger I would break into my mom's stash and use it up (what a jerk...I know). Now that I have tried so many other shampoos I was completely disappointed with this. Either they changed the formula or it was never that good to begin with. After using this my hair felt drier and even my scalp started to get dry and itchy. I now have a giant bottle of crap shampoo that I have to throw out or maybe give to an unsuspecting friend/relative to try.FYI: I have thick, wavy/straight hair that I blow dry and/or straighten 75% of the time.I gave it two stars because even though I hated it, it smells good.Despite the price difference, I have officially converted to Aveda hair products because they never let me down and my hair is awesome when I use them."
4,Like it,"I use this shampoo along with the hydrotherapie conditioner. LOVE LOVE LOVE the conditioner, but the shampoo is really nothing special. Smells great though."
5,Excellent service,Got this product on time and the seller was kind enough to provide free conditioner and body lotion(biolage) I would want to continue buying from this seller in the future as they definitely know how to keep their customers happy!
5,Great Shampoo,This is a must for anyone with chemically processed hair. I have tried many different salon/beauty supply store shampoos looking for something that works. I will never go back to anything else.
5,Best stuff for your hair,"I had dry hair, but this fixed it. One bottle lasts forever and my hair is very long. Never going back to Pantene. I love this stuff!"
5,good hair,I have used both cheaper and more expensive shampoo but have found that I always come back to Biolage. It is a great product.
1,too slow,Ordered March 29 and still not shipped on April 27. Why is this product still available to purchase if the orders obviously can't be filled?
1,Third time is the charm...?,I've left 2 reviews already of this product. The Primary Purpose of doing so was to save others grief. This product is DISCONTINUED and no longer available. Both OpticsPlanet and Amazon are aware and they have not removed the item.
4,A great product poorly packed.,"This is an updated review of the Park Tilting Base. I think the product is great, but mine arrived severely bent because of how it was packed.The long mounting bolt ships installed and in this case over-tightened. The over-tightening pushed the sides quite far toward the middle, giving the entire base a pronounced curve. Installing the truing stand into the base straightened the curve substantially, but for a long time the stand would rock significantly.After a month the stand is much flatter - the plastic seems to be very slowly losing its bend. While not perfect, it is much more stable now, and I am hoping that eventually the bend will be lost entirely.The ability to tilt the truing stand is very nice and the tool/parts bins are very handy.I use this base with a TS-2.2 truing stand. Extra shims are included with the base to fit the newer model stand."
5,Great base,I put this base on Parks Pro truing stand and what a huge difference it made in being able to adjust angles and views to get the wheel true. Fantastic base that makes using the truing stand tremendously easier.I would highly recommend this for the Parks Pro truing stand.
5,great accessory,provides a very stable platform in which to use the truing stand.Although it's just made of plastic when bolted with the stand seems to be very robust in nature.Doesn't look like it would break.Have been using for many months. Would highly recommend.
5,Pretty Cool Stand,"I bought the TS2 and thought bloody hell, this thing is HEAVY! I had an old Minoura that was 1/3rd the weight as the TS2 and could stand on it's own, but the TS2 needs help. As heavy as the TS2 is, this stand works perfectly."
1,only one good song,"terrible purchase i threw it away only had one good song. plus she realy is not recording any new material,she signs like a scorn woman."
5,The Best German Grammar Book Ever,"Schwarz Rot Gold ist fantastisch! I was floundering a tad with my grammar until I got it, but it's helping me no end! Yay! Get this book. Get it now.Tschus!"
4,Nice suit,"This is a nice suit, and I love the fit- especially the low cut V-neck. However, be warned that it is not a true black. It is more of a charcoal/brown and didn't match my black cover up. The only thing that would make it better would be a lining with some sort of stomach control for those of us who are not 18 anymore!"
4,A Challenging Read,"I had to read this book for a college english class; it's not a book that I would typically choose to read on my own. It's a tough read, the language is different because it was translated from French. Also, it takes place in Rwanda, and the people are not the best educated. I like the way the book was written, but the story was a little rough to read."
1,There are better books on the subject of Rwanda,"There is a dominant sexual theme in this book that I find very disturbing. The horrific genocide is a backdrop to a perverse sexual focus by the author. I was unable to finish it.That said, I recommend both Philip Gourevitch's We Wish to Inform You as well as LGen Romeo Dallaire's Shake Hands with the Devil, although if you are to read but one I suggest the former.This book is not even particular well written."
2,Should Have been Non Fiction,"The author does himself and his subject a disservice by immersing this incredible human tragedy in a saccharine, vapid love story. The characters are all two dimensional. The author's expertise is obviously in the area of journalism. He offers clear descriptions of a country slowly descending into hell. However, too often the unfortunately wriiten love story gets in the way of the real story."
2,Why We Miss Graham Greene,"The legacy of the 1994 Rwanda genocide still needs to find its fictional counterpoint to Philip Gourevitch's masterpiece ""We Wish to Inform You . . ."" This novel, however, is not it. It is weighed down with terrible dialogue and schmaltzy prose: ex: ""Gentille let a few salty little pearls run down her satiny cheeks."" The characters are all good or all bad and there is no depth to their mental struggles. Courtemanche gets credit for resisting the trap of letting savages take care of savages, and he does point fingers in the right direction (France, Belgium). But in the end, he has saddled this story with a shallow, falsely-poetic protagonist, and I was left wondering what Greene would have done had he lived long enough into the 1990s to serve as witness to the horrible Rwandan genocide."
1,"This book is purient garbage, don't waste your money","I was in Kigali before and during the war. I saw the massacres first hand. This book absolutely disgusts me. It is nothing more than a very badly written, factually very inaccurate, attempt to make money on the backs of the dead. Do not waste your money. There are many well written books about the genocide, such as We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda by Philip Gourevitch or the new one by General Dallaire, who was the head of the UN Peacekeeping Force. Shake Hands with the Devil : The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda"
4,Hollywood and comics,"This is far from being a comprehensive documentary on comic books that have made it to the silver screen, but it's a fun little overview, featuring some of the big-name titles that have broken comic books out of its niche and made them more approachable and even acceptable in the mainstream: Superman, Batman, Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" and particularly Spiderman, as well as the artists and directors who made them possible, including Guillermo Del Toro, Richard Donner, and Marvel Comics' grandmaster, Stan Lee. There's even a few little segments on some oddities, like Roger Corman's attempt at filming The Fantastic Four on a shoestring budget and the 1940s serial versions of classic DC titles. It's a little bit dated, in the fact that it features some hints on the early development of titles like Watchmen and Iron Man, which have now been released, but it's a lot of fun and a good way for a neophyte to comic books to get their feet wet."
5,The End of Reading,"Cut to the quick! Read this and you won't need to read further. Doesn't matter whether or not you think of yourself as a student of Zen. Wei Wu Wei goes to the heart and throws it in your face so clearly that the only way you won't ""get it"" is if you resist. If that is the case then stop reading all together. Save your money and buy insurance. A brilliant classic!"
2,dull,Not nearly as interesting as I expected. A good reading of the Tao would have led to the same insights with fewer words.
5,Bought this as a birthday gift for my mother.,She loves this show and all the discs was in great shape and played just fine!If I had this purchase to do over again I would!
4,This thing is LEGIT.,"Everything is what you have already read. This knife is amazing. The quality and construction are outstanding and you'll really get a good feeling when you hear all the tools click precisely into place. I took down one star because this knife doesn't contain scissors, but none of the Alox scaled ones do. You can fix this by purchasing a Classic SD SAK in either alox or plastic handle. I personally recommend getting the plastic one, because you'll also have solved the problem of not having the tweezers or toothpick. I'll stick with my SuperTinker model SAK, but if you like this tool selection, BUY THIS."
5,Landscaper gift,I gave these as Christmas gifts to my landscapers and they were really excited to get them. After Christmas they told me how they had used them during the holidays. It's a great gift!
4,Good knife needs work,The ribbing on side wears off on change in pocket. Also the saw attachment has no indentation on it to open.
1,Applique,I was very disappointed in this book. The first time from Amazon this has happened. The amount of colored plates was very minimal.I did not like the way the book was laid out. I was wxpecting more illustrations and patterns in color. And more patterns. period.nap
5,On The Floor Laughing!!!,"I made the mistake of popping the cd in while driving on the freeway. I laughed so hard that I couldn't catch my breath...so hard I started sweating! This cd is funnier than most. Where this guy has been, I don't know but if laughter is medicine - this guy has the cure for cancer!"
4,Helps me get motivated to have a lovely home,"I found this once in a library in Texas - a nice change from most organizational books. Goes month by month, and gives a different focus idea for each month. Good ideas for getting motivated, but not too much nuts and bolts - get those from other books. This is for motivation and direction."
3,Plastic,Our child did not get especially enthusiastic with this plastic toy/ Maybe she'll like it better as she gets older.
3,used,"Love Fiestaware but this platter, although nice, looks a little used. There was no gum sticker on the bottom as was with other pieces I've purchased and it was securely wrapped and taped with bubble wrap. After I got it unwrapped I noticed there were more pieces of tape in other places that had to be gently scraped off. I'm keeping it but if somethings used then sell it as used. I feel a little cheated."
2,Not worth it!!!!!,"It says ""spoons"" in the heading of this listing, as in plural, as in more than one! Also nowhere in the description did it have an amount but I figured for $15 I would get at LEAST 3-5 spoons but i guess assuming was my mistake. When I got the package I looked inside and couldnt believe that I paid $15 for one spoon?! Not only that but it is just your garden variety teaspoon with a cheap plastic coating. I could have made one of these for $1 and saved myself the other $14. Other than that I dont know much because I never ended up using it so I apologise that I cant offer any more insight. If I could do it over though I would have haved my money!"
3,Weiner dog male wraps,"I ordered 6 of the size small, thinking that they would fit my tweenie sized dachshunds (13-14 lbs) and matching the girth measurements for this size. When they arrived the elastic was so tight, even with manual stretching and re-washing. They are even snug on miniature dachshunds as small as 7 lbs. I then ordered 12 of the medium, which by the measurement charts, would have been a bit big for my tweenie sized dachshunds. Well, the size difference between the small and the medium is HUGE. And unfortunately the medium's elastic is way too loose so the dachshunds can walk out of them. Had the elastic been as tight as the size small's, they could have worked better."
3,A cute classic from a much-loved author,"This book had an interesting setting: construction of a luxury hotel in the middle of the desert. The architect and the chief engineer were at odds through most of the story, and I liked how they slowly came to appreciate the other. The second half had an exciting injection of action/adventure to balance the relationship aspect and the artistic details of the setting."
3,Just an OK Book,"BEST LAID PLANS is the sequel to Loving Jack, an ok story, but not one of Nora Roberts' best.Abra Wilson was not impressed with Cody's building design, in fact she thought it was impractical. Cody Johnson thought Abra had style, but was very distracting for an engineer. Sparks ignited in the desert building site, and then passion soon followed. But was it enough to stop someone from trying to destroy their first project together? Would they be able to find out who it is before any more damage is done?This is a decent book, but not one of Roberts' finest. BEST LAID PLANS is a feel good romance, with few twists and is very predictable. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, struggle with that love, then live happily-ever-after. However, since this is a book by Nora Roberts, it's definitely worth reading!!"
1,Very dissapointed.,"I bought this sphygmomanometer after the stellar reviews I'd read here. I'm a nursing student and just wanted something to practice with at home, and also to be able to more accurately test ailing family members who check their BP at home (and myself during pregnancy; I'm highly predisposed to preeclampsia).It's pretty and it seems to fit well, but that's about it. I think there may actually be something wrong with my particular cuff. The first thing I noticed was that even with the valve on the bulb completely closed, air still steadily releases from the cuff, making it impossible to properly control the air release. Because of this I can't properly pinpoint the systolic BP and the diastolic measurements I've been getting are so high they can't possibly accurate. I thought at first that I just didn't have it tight enough, but I tried it on multiple people and I've had no trouble with other cuffs."
4,Good,good quality and easy to get good results from when using. I use it when I need it and think it will last.
4,Whoa.....,"This has got to be one of the weirdest romances I have ever read in my life. Imagine the whole thing done in emails! But i thought it was halarious! I mean at one part of the book that took off there socks and checked there feet...haha. I guess you had to read it...lol. Anyways, even though some of the english terms were hard to understand, im a american this book was still horibly funny and I would recomend it to anyone who needs a good laugh. Also, on the preview pages of the book (I forget what you call them...) it does has this writting like the two authours are chatting and linda tells chris she has a good idea for a book and chris asks what and she says that they email each other or something like that. And chris asks what the plot and linda says there isnt one yet. And she wants HIM to play the girl! HAHA. I thought that made it even more funny the male writer playing the girl.....lol. Anyways, this book was awesome to the end and very unique."
1,Incompatible with Hummingbird software!,"I just wanted to let everyone know that this product is not compatible with a computer that is running Hummingbird NFS Maestro Client to map NFS drives. If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry. I was able to isolate the issue using some debugging tools - and if I turned off Hummingbird Mapping, the bluetooth adapter worked fine.When I say ""incompatible"" - I mean it. The computer will keep randomly crashing with the ""explorer.exe has to terminate now"" error, and other winlogin.exe errors.I'm using Windows XP Pro SP2 with all the latest fixes. I contacted support from Trendware - and they basically told me it's not their problem. Just letting everyone know - I hope this saves at least 1 person the headaches I've had trying to get this adapter installed and working."
1,Don't try any Trendware product with rebate offer,It has been months and I haven't get my rebate back. My first submission was instantly declined for an apparently wrong reason. I waited and waited until I was allowed to resubmit. And then I waited and waited and waited for even longer... Still not resolved. Their rebate sucks!
2,Doubts about this product,"I am afraid of bying this product. I am ""needing"" a bluetooth adapter to connect my Nokia 3650 with my Pentium.Reading the reviews of other adapters I realize I can't buy any type of this advice. Many people are having trouble trying to connect their mobile phones with computers. I've read only 2 reviews about this Trendware adapter, and even though they rate it good, the computer system used is a MAC OS X (mine is a PC Win200), and the cell phone is a Sony Ericsson.And more, the price is too good to trust so quick."
3,Works fine... sorta...,"I bought the TRENDnet adaptor instead of the D-Link adaptor which Apple supports, based on price and the reviews below. I'm using it on my PowerMac Dual 2ghz G5 to connect a Bluetooth Mighty Mouse. Unfortunately, when the computer is put to sleep the mouse goes dead. The only way to reconnect the mouse is to disconnect the adpator and reconnect it. This is a bit of a pain and requires me to only use the adaptor in the USB port at the front of the Mac.Otherwise, works just fine, but I could see this being a long term frustration for some people."
3,"Confusing Software, but decent quality vs. price","The overall profile of the adapter is very nice, perhaps having the ability to attach it to a keychain would be a nice addition. Very easy to lose the cap though.The software footprint by most stardards is HUGE, you don't feel it is native to the OS, it takes quite a bit of memory in my opinion. The documentation is sparse, so if you are a beginning user, I would spend more money and get something with better documented, easier to use software.Overall the product works well, the range is adequate. It works great teathering my phone PPC6700, not so doog with my bluetooth headset HS820.If you are more of an advanced user, I would recommened this, based soley on price."
5,A great product,"I was hesitant at first to buy from a brand I had never heard of, but it's been working perfectly for weeks now and I use 2 bluetooth devices simultaneously all the time. Can't believe it's this good for the price."
2,Worked for 3 days,"Unfortunately I am not a guru on the computer. I bought the product to work with my cell phone (sony ericsson T616) so I could transfer my pictures to the computer and hopefully get ringtones from the computer to my phone. I was able to use it fine for 3 days. After that it had technical difficulties. such as not being able to find my device (phone) or it found it but couldn't transfer. I don't have the time or patience needed for some of the computer stuff. I tried troubleshooting, it began to get more complicated. Anyone who is familiar with computers may not have a problem installing, uninstalling, troubleshooting, etc to get it to work again."
5,What an excellent product/price!,"I bought this hoping it would work with my mac even though reviewers said it would I couldn't understand why the manufacturer did not say it would. Anyway, plug and play pretty much. I had to do a couple of minutes of configuring, but I haven't had to think about it since and the range is way better than my other non-bluetooth wireless devices. I will never buy another wireless device that doesn't use this technology."
2,Not worth your money.,"This product is not worth it. While you are able to transfer files, it only allows you to pretty much only do that. Cannot use ActiveSync."
3,not that easy to use,"This bluetooth is complicated to use, the software is hard to understand and i can't get connected to my bt devices.... However, Amazon ships my item really fast"
2,"Sometimes works, mostly doesn't.","XP SP2 on a Compaq laptop. I'm an IT Professional and Windows developer, so I'm pretty knowledgable about drivers and such. This product is a dissapointment. Trying to connect to my Motorola V330 is very hit and miss. Occasionally it works perfectly. Plug it in, finds the phone, hooray. But 95%+ of the time it can't find the phone. I'll work with it for a couple of hours, installing, re-installing, modifying which drivers its using, etc, and eventually I might get it to work. But then the next day it won't work anymore. Kind of like going back to the early days of Windows 95. If I had to do it all over again, I'd definately spend the extra $20 and get a more proven device."
3,"Works, but took some effort.",I purchased this Bluetooth adapter to send my contacts to my new Bluetooth enabled cell phone. Neither the manual or company website gave good directions about XP installing a default driver that didn't have the same compatibility as their own driver. I found some directions on some forums and was eventually able to transfer everything over.
1,Poor directions and slow support,"This device is supposed to allow you to add bluetooth functionality to your notebook. It may do that, but the directions are of no use with Windows porgram beyond Win98. Apparently, you need to disable a bunch of Windows functions in XP or 2000 for this to work. That is never mentioned in the directions.An email to customer support went unanswered for 5 days. When the answer came in it was complex. I returned the product.TRENDnet Bluetooth USB Adapter"
1,Worked fine until...,"I got mine less than a month ago. I bought it because I read other reviews and I thought it would be the perfect complement for my SET610. First two weeks, great wonderful. Then something happened. From time to time my computer said ""bluetooth device not found"". I guess it overheated or something, because I unplugged it for about 15 minutes and plugged it back again, and it worked fine again. It was annoying. Now this weekend it suddenly stopped working at all. It was a major disappointment. I'm sending it back. I guess it's not a bad product. I was just unlucky, but I'll choose another one.Trend brand lost a customer."
3,"OK, but bad software installer","I just got the product and installed the CD that came with it. The installer kept coming up with boxes saying that this or that file was missing. Then before I could try to find the file it asked for, it would ask for another missing file. At one time, it kept popping up missing file boxes to where there were about 6 of them on the screen. It seems that a professional product like this should include all the install files on the CD. At this point, I have only had limited results when connecting to other devices. I don't think the installer installed the drivers correctly."
2,Problems with XP update SP2,"Not always detected by XP. I had SP2 already installed and XP would not find the bluetooth device. I ran the installation CD more than 6 times! Right after installation it would work, but if you reboot it would not detect it. Sometimes, it would just work if I remove the adapter and plug it right back in. It kept pulling up the 'Driver Signing' dialog box. The instructions even tell you this is not licensed by Windows! I didn't think much of it until it created detection problems. I couldn't tell if at any given time the adapter was still connected or not. When it works its great though. No complains there (although I did have trouble getting Nokia PC Suite to work with it). Would be a great product if it weren't conflicting with XP update SP2. This product went right back where it came from. Going to look for one that XP will recognize."
3,Not quite what I needed,"The product is reasonably priced and conveniently sized, unfortunately I found out after purchasing, opening and using the product that it was incompatible with the version of Bluetooth that my smartphone (Cingular 8125) uses. Basically the device has been useless to me, I wish they had offered more detailed information on compatibility."
3,Some big problem.,"This Bluetooth/USB adapter has a big problem, and I can think in 4 possibilities:1 - It's not full compatible with WinXP SP 2;2 - It's not full compatible with Nokia PC Suite;3 - It's not full compatible with Nokia 6255 mobile;4 - It's not full compatible with USB interface.I conclude this because I just can't transfer more than 3 or 4 Mb before it freeze. And I have to reboot the Bluetooth of the mobile or the Windows, and even so it not always come back to work. So if I want to fill my 128 Mb MMC in my Nokia 6255 mobile with mp3, I have to do 25 transfers and 25 boots in my system. So if you use some of the above products, don't buy this Bluetooth, try something else. By the way, some times the windows will not even recognize it."
1,Avoid,This book gives more of the feel of having watched a one hour programme on television rather than a reading a comprehensive history book. The book is in excellent format and has great pictures but something is not there. Maybe if you knew nothing or very little about WWII and your literary skills are at a magazine level would this book be good for you. If you know more then this book offers very little.The first chapters are the best and then it is down hill. Stalingrad and Kursk are dealt with in fairly vague terms and hardly any detail is given to the Russian advance west. The book is constantly split up in mini articles and quotes but the prespective offered is often too much on the German side.Today there are plenty of books on the Eastern Front and probably all of them are better.
2,Four stars if only I could stomach Lee's voice...,"Why the hell is singer Lee Dorrian sound like such a bozo here. He sounds way to goofy on this album like he's trying to make his fans laugh. There's no growling but broken attempt to sing made me eject the CD just after the Tony Iommi song. The playing here is pretty good. A real heavy classic rock sound, lighter on the sludge and DOOM of previous releases ETHEREAL MIRROR and SOUL SACRIFICE. But I can't handle the vocals on this particular Cathedral album. 'Consistent' is a word these guys are unfamiliar with."
3,Biography good.,"If your looking for an instructional DVD, this is not for you. Good interviews and some clips of playing but really about how he got where he is. I did learn some things I didn't know but no chat about his gear or technique, more about his philosophy and attitude to playing. Still love you billy, but rhythm mag billed this as instructional and it isn't."
3,Will keep it for a backup,"The only thing this stylus has going for it is the thinner tip. The stylus itself is too thin for me and my hands starts to cramp up while using this stylus. It's also not very responsive and I almost have to ""jab"" my iPad or use a lot more pressure than any other stylus I've owned in order touches to register."
5,"RACHEL PORTMAN, NOT MARK ISHAM!!!!","For the record, Rachel Portman scored this movie, not Mark Isham, and its absolutely one of her best. The night I went to go see this film, I instantly started looking for the soundtrack album. Guess what. Not available in the U.S. I found out. WTF??!!You will probably have to find a seller overseas who has it for sale but it is well worth it! It only took me a couple years to find it!If you're a fan of Rachel Portmans's film scores, DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!!See the movie too!"
1,A misfire from Microsoft,"What a misfire! Sure, this thing is big, but it cannibalizes existing quotations dictionaries. There is little here that is original. Alan Greenspan has four quotes--and not one of them is ""irrational exuberance."" Go figure. William Shatner is not here saying ""Get a life!"" The New Yorker's famous ""On the Internet, no one knows you're a dog"" is not here. Oprah is here, but what she says is not memorable. Oh, and Alexander Pope is here. Lots of Pope. It must have taken the editors _minutes_ to copy this from other books. The strong London bias to the book is very evident. American editors were needed who wouldn't have made many of these errors. The book should be on your shelf, but it's not what it should have been."
4,Great proof book,"This is a great album for showing things like wedding proof prints. This model lets you store 500 prints, and there's another similar one for 250. I love that it lets you show vertically and horizontally cropped images in the same book, on the same page, without having to spin the book around or tilt your head.The only problem for me, and this is a minor one, is that it is setup for 60%/40% horiz/vert but I find that when shooting people and portraits I tend to shoot more like 40/60 horiz/vert and so I'm pressed to make more out of my ""lesser"" shots.Right now at the time of this review amazon isn't selling this album themselves and the listed seller(s) are terribly expensive. Go look around for other deals, but trust that it is a great album."
5,I lived at Compost College 1971 to 1972,This was a time in my life when I was searching for love and family. I am talked about in the book. Steve Lappin
4,Bargain,"This was exactly what I wanted and expected. For this price it is a great buy. Be aware that the continents are simply stickers. They are very high class stickers though (I ordered the gold continents pendant). I ordered two of them as gifts - one was perfect, but the other has a slight crease across South America. However, the price is so cheap that you can't have your expectations too high."
3,Smaller than you think.,"It's a pretty tiny globe. I mean its nice if you, like me, specifically wanted a globe necklace, but its pretty tiny and a bit too pricey. It ended up being almost [...] bucks. Too much. Really expensive shipping too, especially for such a small. I bought a DVD at the same time, and paid double in shipping for this little necklace. Maybe try a different one?"
1,Rental Nightmare,I'm sure it's me but I rented a couple of these and it never went to my TIVO. I don't think I'll be renting (or buying) a download again.
4,Very Nice Film,"This is a focused, well-made, entertaining film. The plot is touching, and the actors portray the characters honestly and realistically. The specific troubles of the boy were sometimes unclear, and the ending somewhat sudden, but these are minor flaws and overall this is a movie certainly worth seeing. William Hurt is particularly moving as the lonely postmaster. Highly recommended."
5,Great Movie,"I saw this movie while working in Child Protective Services. It's a great teaching tool for any would be foster/adopt parent(s). I'd buy it for my own collection if they would ever release it to DVD or Blu-ray. I recommend you jump at the opportunity to watch this movie if you ever get the chance--it's quite moving and very much true to life. (It's definitely drama, so you'll have to be in the right mood to enjoy it)."
5,What dogs know ...,"As an experimental psychologist who has closely examined claims of the paranormal (see ""The Conscious Universe"" here on Amazon.com), I wasn't sure what to think of Sheldrake's experiments with telepathic dogs. Then I had an opportunity to review and analyze the raw data in some of his controlled experiments. I was astonished with the results. There is basically no doubt that some dogs do indeed anticipate when their owners are about to return home, even at randomly selected times, and without benefit of any explicit or subliminal cues. For me, this significantly raises the credibility of some of the other ""powers"" of animals that Sheldrake discusses so clearly. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever gazed at their dog and wondered what was going on in that furry little head."
1,Dogs Who Don't Know When They're Owners Come Home,"I recently saw the 20/20 episode concerning this book. While doctors agree that animals have some senses about their owners, a test they aired proved that most dogs do not know when they're owners are coming home. The episode showed one camera on a pet, and the other camera with the pet's owners. This particular dog waited by the window for hours, so , of course, when the owner got home, the dog was already by the window. I will agree that dogs have certain senses about things, but the ""super human"" abilities, come on! That is ridiculous. Until my dog saves me from a car accident or saves me from a life-threatening situation, I say this book has no merit."
3,u are better off buying their other albums,"Carcass has always been a band that I regard as one of the most talented to come out of the underground, but with this compilation of rarities and b sides and whatever else was thrown together was a disappointment. I don't want to be a judge here with carcass but I would rather recommend ""heartwork"" and ""swansong"" instead of this one, it just seemed like a slap in the face that such a great and overly talented band would put this out as a good bye to all the carcass fans. I would like to see this band get back together and put out the most destrucive album as a payback for all the criticizm especially from a fan like me. This album is for the die hard fan who wants something for the carcass collection. Surely not their best album, but it does have some good points here and there but overall, put your money to good use with heartwork or swansong."
4,wake up and get this album (and get Heartwork too),"A post-breakup collection of EP and unreleased material. Starts with some surprisingly good tracks from the Swansong sessions, amazingly solid tunes considering they're outtakes. Then some good live tracks from the Heartwork era. Then closing out with the bloody, ugly early grind of old EP tracks. A good review of this great band."
3,"Definitely weird. Not bad, though.","This is a weird release because Carcass's style changed SO MUCH over the life of the band and this ""compilation"" doesn't really try to ease you through it at all.It starts with several tracks from the Swansong sessions. These are pretty much straight on metal, not grind or death metal at all. Sort of thrash, I guess, with growled vocals. It does include the excellent (and funny) ""I Told You So (Corporate Rock Really Does Suck),"" which may be reason enough to get the CD right there. If you're a fan of the Swansong era, these tracks are all worthwhile.Then we move backward in time to ""Necrotism"" era death/grind and all the way back to full on grindcore. The effect is somewhat disjointed to say the least.Not sure what this is really trying to be other than another release to get hard-core fans' money. The tracks are all good, however, and it's worth picking up if you have ""Heartwork"" and ""Necrotism."""
5,Eternal legacy of brutal rythmic pleasure,"Forget those fools who dont rate this album - these b sides and rare tracks are A standard. The first five tracks are awesome showing a mature and developed band with a sense of humour, but dont think you cannot take these tunes seriously - if you are into metal it doesnt get any better. Then the cd regresses through past glory taking you to where the band came from. The world is not the same without Carcass - the coolest heavy band to grace our bleeding ears - BRUTAL!"
3,Good book,This was a short book on the Swedish. It was written with dry humor and the Swedes were made fun of to a degree. But one did get a picture of the main personality traits of the Swedish people via a quick read.
1,look somewhere else,"If you're on your way to Sweden and you're looking for some insight into the culture, look elsewhere! The references are obscure (historical and political) and the information oblique...it only makes a small amount of sense after you've been there. The entire book pokes fun at the Swedes without relaying any substantial information. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,"Overrated, boring, a huge disappointment","Ghost in the Shell: it's been called the next Akira, and one of the best anime films of all time. Well, I'm a huge anime fan, and I couldn't stand this movie. My god, was it ever BORING! I swear, I fell asleep watching this. But to be fair, the DVD does have some good special features. But please, PLEASE, view it before you buy it."
2,I expected more,"Plot: It's the future, there's android machine people, and the story follows a cop who's an android. The humans get body parts replaced, even their brains, but they have a ""ghost"" which seems to be what makes them ""human"". Deals with a theme of what makes us human. (It was hard to follow, that's what I could gather from it.)My thoughts: The plot was very hard to follow, the dub of the main character's voice is horrible, didn't give me any care for what happens to the characters. I watched the first half, with no desire to watch the second. The animation itself was good, which is what gives it the 2 stars."
5,GITS--one kickin' DVD,"This was the first DVD that really showed what anime was capable of in this format. All anime on DVD should strive for this level of quality, both in terms of video and audio, and in content and extras."
3,The cheese factor destroys what would be a great movie,"I don't know, Japanese culture is so radically different from Western, that's probably the reason Ghost in the Shell never did it for me. It's not a bad movie, in fact it's good, well, that is until the ending which absolutely ruins the whole she-bang (no pun intended).The animation is gorgeous, the plot and characters are well placed, but the damned ending is so cheesy it makes me want to wretch. I guess if you can bypass the ending (I've custom edited my VHS version) then this is quite a good flick, just don't expect a really cool ending (but hell, what movies these days come out with a non-cheesball ending). Face/Off anyone? Ugh, another good movie gone to waste by it's laughable ending. Anyways, my two cents :P"
2,My favourite BORING animated movie!,"If you like anime, you will not like this. It's all about philosophy and lots of boring chitty-chat questioning life. The thing is, you can not relate yourself to the characters because their all cyborgs, and the world they live in is so dark and unrealistic. There are only two action scenes, but aren't very exciting and has exploding heads! When you reach the end you can't believe you paid the kind of money you did to get the film, expecting something groundbreaking, instead you get something reasonably scary, but absolute rubbish. The only reason why it got two, instead of one, is because the quality of the animation with the use of computer graphics is good."
2,Uh... Interesting,"I haven't seen a whole huge ammount of anime, but to me this movie just seemed to drag on. Just seemed to try much too hard to be complex and intellectual, it ended up boring and long. I don't really think a movie 'needs' huge weaponry and loads of nudity or blood to be good, this just seemed boring."
2,Very Disappointing,"While this film features animation that is truly interesting to watch, it does nothing in terms of plot, characters, or even originality. Sure, you'll see very interesting weaponry and a quasi-futuristic city (the detail in the backgrounds is arguably the most enjoyable aspect of this film). But overly plagued by nudity and witless interactions of the characters, this film barely makes the cut for a rental."
2,Try another,"Bluntly said Ghost in the Shell is ok. It's not spectacular. The premisis is normal for cyberpunk, the art is brilliant at times horrible at others, the voices are ok but far too quiet, and the nudity felt too tacked on and there was much too much of it. You should check out Stand alone complex before you resort to this. BTW for a special edition they don't put that much special stuff in, and the packaging is horribly annoying and impossible to handle."
2,I'm sorry I bought it,This movie ain't all that. The animation is decent. The voices are nice. Semi-rent-worthy. Japan can do a lot better than this.
5,Ghost In The Shell (the bomb),"Best anime movie I ever seen. It has great animation and great drawings. The sound effects are the best i have heard.To me this is the best movie i eaver seen. Is kind of difficult to follow the movie, but when you really get into the movie is incredible. This is a must have video. There should be more movies like this. I give it a high 10."
5,a movie for thinkers,"this was a splendid movie indeed!!the anamation was great!! story great !! action and deeper meaning, better then most blockbusters. the one complaint i have is that in the movie there are several instances where the director has set aside thinking time and that gets kinda annoying. Still a greAT BUY"
5,One of the Best Anime Evere made.,"This is indeed a good film. Good story, good animation, and best of all some good V acting. Get it.Unrated. Contains Brief Nudity, Violence and Strong Language. Ages 13+-."
4,Ghost in the shell dvd,"its the original dvd, with only one extra clip about the original release that happened in theaters. I wasnt impressed with the extras at all, but you dont order this one for the extras. You order it for the movie. The movie as always is great."
4,Ghost in the Shell,"As a fan of animation and of anime, this film is a cornerstone of the industry. Great characters, great writing, fantastic action and a visual that is just this side of a revelation.Fantastic film!"
5,A must have DVD for any anime/sci-fi fan,"This is the best anime I know of. Simply excellent. The story is intelligent, based on Masamune Shirows manga. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. I own the soundtrack, so I guess that explains how I feel about the music.This is probably the best way to get to know anime. If you are interested in anime, buy this, it will get you hooked. If you like anime, you've aleady got it (or you're just plain stupid ;).The only disappointment is the awful elevator-music on the otherwise fine making-of documentary.There are no excuses, if you own a DVD player, you should have this."
3,Ummm... It was interesting...,"My brother and I are a huge fans of Anime. So when we sat down to watch this movie, we were excited. We saw the whole movie, and the first reaction was ""huh? wat just happened?"" I have to admit that this was not the best anime I ever saw."
3,"Great anime, but where is the Japanese audio, and English subtitles??!!","Excellent anime for anyone getting into the genre, or for those Shirow fans who have to have everything! A classic, but a classic with one major flaw.That flaw being that they didn't add the original Japanese audio along with the English subtitles for this UMD! Sorry, but that is just unforgiveable, and don't get me wrong I still love it and the English audio isn't bad it's just I'd rather listen to the original voices.Shame on Sony and Manga Video for not including thats why I'm only giving 3 stars."
5,Trancends Anime,"Maybe you've had a friend tell you to check out this ""Anime scene"". Maybe you are venturing into Japanese animation on your own.This is an excellent movie, and an exemplary display of the ""Anime"" genre. Truely, this is a classic movie.If you saw this once in a theater you'd probably be confused. But you've purchased (or are about to purchase) a masterpiece DVD. Repeated viewings are a given and will be rewarded.What does it mean to be human? _The Matrix_, _Blade Runner_, and the like have all asked this question. When does a computing machine stop being a pile of plastic and metal and start becoming life-like?_Ghost in the Shell_ addresses this question and answers it.If you like watching movies, if you like answering life's puzzles, if you like genre busting and paradigm shifting films, you'll really like _Ghost in the Shell_."
4,good but,It is a well-made animation. The plot is solid. But it is a little hard to understand the story in some respects. Keep it in mind that it doesn't have a lot of action.
5,Visually stunning and great music!,"I would like to start off by saying I've seen Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2ng Gig. I figured the movie was worth a watch and I was in for a surprise. I loved the music, it was very soothing throughout all of the series. The action scenes were well placed and nothing gets me more hyped then watching cyborg cops battle cyborg villains. The story is truly complex and many deep themes are involved. Such as political corruption and real world issues evident in the real today. I also like the detailed backgrounds and the character designs. Visually, everthing was stunning, especially the fight scene at the end (I don't want to ruin it though). Only two anime movies have captivated me this much, Appleseed and Akira. And dare I say the overall visual representation in my opinion is better than that of Akira's."
2,SO BORING,"I couldn't believe how boring this movie was! Sure, the animation was beautiful, but the story was sleep-inducing. If you like this kind of anime, than go for it. I personally like fantasy a lot better and that may be why I didn't like it."
4,Worth a look,"This is sort of a cross between Blade Runner, The Terminator and La Femme Nikita. The animation is good. The story is interesting and raises some philosophical questions. I thought the characters were a bit underdeveloped, although the character biographies in the special features help by giving some background. Another problem is that the music calls too much attention to itself by getting way too strident at times. Overall it's worth a look, especially if you are a fan of anime."
4,The Prequel to the Matrix-,"This has to be one of the best animes that i have ever seen. It looms in the shadows of more popular animes such as Akira and Golgo 13. The overall atmosphere of this movie seems as if the Matrix was based on it. Some of the similarities you will be able to identify right of the bat. The film also has a great plot line. One of most original ones in Japanese animation in the recent years. It doesn't follow where you have a male hero who makes love to a least one women during the film. The movie is one of the most groundbreaking and entertaining of all anime. The only reason it deserved four stars instead of five, was that it did not develop the characters as most would like it to."
4,Excellent transaction,"I liked the movie, if you like Princess Mononoke, then you may like this science fiction movie done with the same style of animation and computer graphics, new DVD came in excellent condition."
4,A must-see for cyberpunk fans.,"Directed by Mamoru Oshii, who is well-known for his work on the extremely popular Patlabor and Urusei Yatsura anime series, explores issues surrounding one's own existence. It's also filled with some of the most poetic and fluid action scenes ever. The DVD transfer is excellent, and the colors, compared to the benchmark Japanese LD version, appear accurate -- especially in the gorgeous background paintings. One star deduction for Manga heinously removing the original end credit song and replacing it with ""One Minute Warning"" (Brian Eno & U2) in the Japanese audio track (somebody was asleep at the wheel in their Quality Control department). Otherwise, a top-notch DVD full of extras and should dispel those with the preconceived notion that Japanese animation is simplistic and just for kids."
4,EXCELLENCE,"alot has been said and written about this great anime film.you know why ? because it diserves it.and all the good reviews you heard about it are true.so go a head,buy it.full of amazing and unforgettable scenes .like the one after the opening credits when motoko wakes up in her apartment.took my breath away .in a story about cyborgs questioning their humanity,and a virus trying to become one.the dvd features are your typical making of video and trailers .there is also a production report and a guide to ghost in the shell.you have to read them though.like akira, the plot isn't that great,but you can't resist watching the film.great anime.average dvd.unrated.suggested 17. means R rated then.alot of artistic nudity."
2,Not at all like the magna.,"I rented this tape in the hope that it would be as good as the manga of which it is based off of. Both of them start off the same and both of them end the same (sort of) but still it doesn't excuse the fact of what was done to the series. The magna contained humor and plot combined perfectly. This tape while having some humor still can't compare to the magna. Some people say that since I'm into humorous anime I won't like any serious show. This is not true. I love Record of Lodoss war and that is serious. This show just didn't have enough plot to get me into it. They also tried to combine a pretty hefty magna into a 90 minute movie. As such they had to sacrifice plot, comedy, and the funniest robots of all time. If you want Ghost in the Shell go get the full issue magna from Dark Horse Comics this just isn't worth it. So unlike almost all the other reviewers I don't love this movie. Sorry."
3,"Certainly different, but not developped enough","This anime film is certainly different from most, and in a good way too, though not all that ground breaking really...It brings up some interesting ideas, but frankly all it does is present these philosophical quandries and does not deal with them in any deeply meaningful way. As for the question of originality, I found the cyborgs' angst awfully remeniscent of Robocop.. The fact that it spawned the highly over-rated Matrix series isn't helping its case either, though really one can't blame Ghost in the Shell for that. ;)Ultimately the film drags, there simply isn't enough put forward to really rivet the viewer - and I do not mean that it lacks action, but that it lacks intellectual rigour. If one is going to go this route, you have to go all the way. Make something of the concepts you are treating."
4,What is the Matrix? Oh sorry wrong movie...,"But the similarities are endless, well this is the movie that the Matrix was based on so what are you going to expect. Anyway, this movie is refreshing break in that it's not artistic or too deep. It's all out action which is a blessed release after the mind jobs Akira and Perfect Blue put on you. But this anime is superb with more breath-taking visual effects than you could poke a stick at and a lovely score that could bring Scrooge to tears. As with all other things, i suggest viewing before buying. I have built it up to be a really good movie but it obviously won't be everyone cup of tea. Manga and Anime fans, knock yourselves out at trying to buy this, anyone else, try before you buy."
5,Good Stuff Maynard!,"This is a sleek, dark and intelegent anime. It pulled me in and I still find small details that make this one of my favorite movies."
2,Most boring anime I've seen,"Never understood why this movie was so popular. Sure it has some pretty cool artwork, I'll give it that, but I've tried to watch this movie 3 times and fell asleep to it in the first 15 min! Story is very boring and confusing letting the viewer lose interest. I rate this 2 stars at most cause of the good artwork but thats it! There are better ones out there! Try ""Ninja Scroll""!!!"
2,Not so much,I will probably get a lot of heat for writing this review but I did not like Ghost in the Shell. I think that the characters are wonderfully drawn and that the writers really tried but Ghost in the Shell just didn't do it for me. There were times when I was fighting myself to not turn it off. I knew that to write a good review I would have to sit through all of it. I did manage to sit through all of it and I still have almost nothing good to say about it. I would only recommend this anime for people who are into the inner workings of computers and people who thought that The Matrix movies was the best trilogy ever.
2,It ain't all that,"i have to admit the animation is very fluid and the scenes are very detailed. But the story line lags and never really takes off. I sat through this movie thinking the story line would pick up along with the action, it never did. Not unless you have the 20$ to spend on this dvd, i would pass on this one. You would be better off buying a trigun episode."
1,don't even bother,The animation may be great but the story is confusing and boring . Compared to even Macross II this movie really sucks.I thought there would be more of a story in it but its so stupid and I would say unfinished.A waste of time.
3,Great service,Great service birthday present for my brother in NY got it very quickly in time for his birthday.
1,For Japanimation this movie did not have guts like others,"When I bought this DVD I thought, cool Japanimation, lots of guns shooting, and guts flying. But boy was this movie tame. Sure it won lots of awards, but I was not impressed at all"
1,"Ah, screw this one, lets watch Ayane's High Kick!","I admit it, the animation WAS good, but it DEFINETLY didn't compare to Slayers or Tenchi Muyo. The action was a total sleeper, unlike Slayers or Tenchi Muyo. And there was a bit TOO much unnecessary nudity and cursing, VERY unlike Slayers or Tenchi Muyo. Basically, guys, what I'm saying is, take the money you were gonna use on this, and buy Slayers or Tenchi Muyo instead."
1,Worst movie ever made?,Mindless animated mush. How can anime fans not fall asleep? I'd rather watch THE IRON GIANT.
5,This is why I bought a DVD Player!,"When I heard that Ghost in the Shell was coming out on DVD, my decision to by a player was cemented. I had seen Ghost in theatres, owned the VHS version, but it just wasn't enough. I had to have the best possible copy of this movie available, and I was not dissapointed. I always thought the VHS looked pretty darn good, but when I compared the two I was blown away by the clarity of the animation on DVD. The sound was equally perfect. And having the option to listen to the original Japanese dialogue was also a plus. This is the film that shows off just how good a DVD can look, and should be seen by all anime fans this way."
5,One of the best sci-fi Animes ever...,"This has to be the best anime I've ever watched, along with Perfect Blue. Both keep you on the edge of your seat. I can't watch it enough. Ghost in the Shell is the absolutely a great movie to start your collection or for someone whose been at it for a long time. I think everyone should see this, the graphics are great. The plot is wonderful. I just can say enough good stuff about it."
5,Wonderful Animation,Great storyline. Fantastic score. One should try listening to the analog recording of the soundtrack (in laser disc format) the music will blow your mind.
5,Quality in the Shell,"This is the Kind of DVD that screams out to be bought. For a good reason, the quality of the animation, the story and the character development are atleast as good as Akira.This movie is one of those Manga Movies you must have. It's a story I could watch 3 times and stil see new things. The final idea behind the story is....refreshing. This movie is unlike many others...this belongs in the TOP of DVD's"
5,The standard,This is without a doubt the standard for which all Anime will be compared for some time.The motion of the characters is what truly sets it apart. They don't move like a robot or float about. The accuracy of their movement is only equaled by fully rendered computer animation.This movie belongs in the Anime Hall of Fame!
4,another anime with superb animation!,"Ghost in the Shell is another movie that defines what a good Anime is. The animation is what really makes it stand out. Each scene is beautifully drawn and the colors have a real mystifying effect. There are some GREAT action sequences that are worth seeing. Its a futuristic setting with cops, crooks, cyborgs, computers, and a big shiny city. While the overall movie is dazzling, it wasn't exactly ""mind-blowing"". The movie was very serious and didn't keep moving at times. It might even confuse some viewers, it didn't have a very fulfilling ending, but the nudity isn't too much. The Ghost in the Shell is definitley worth seeing."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"This is the best anime to it's best. The story, sound, and animation explains it all. This is English translated unlike the 2nd one, Innocence."
5,The film that looks technology in another way,"Ghost in the Shell marks the world as a new vision how technology could affect our lives. Set in a futuristic Japan where man and machine live together. It has many ideas that where later used in the film Matrix and dwells in the thematic of what is the difference between man and machine. Where is the line that defines the soul and self awareness, and if machines could be ""alive"".Definitely a film you must see!"
5,Great Movie with realism and great plot to think about.,"Ghost in the Shell is a great movie. I loved the artwork, it looks quite realistic. And the theme about what it means to be alive really gets you thinking, even with all of the action going on."
4,Intriguing tale of a cyborg and her questions.,"Definitely aimed at the mature audiences, Ghost in the Shell addresses some of the more profound questions that people ask everyday.To be honest, first time around, I couldn't fully appreciate its thoughtful content because I was overwhelmed by spectacular graphics and dramatic action sequences. However, during the second viewing I was able to go beyond the pretty face and catch the glimpse of its soul, a profound tale of a cyborg haunted by questions that some people choose to ask, or choose to ignore, or worst, forget to ask.Only aspect of Ghost in the Shell that I thought lacking was the viewing time. I really think it could have been longer to further develop the plot and deal with barrage of questions it poses on the audience.If you happen to enjoy this Anime, I also recommend Patlabor 2, by the director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii, which I think is more refined one of the two."
2,a lot of narrative but no plot,"I get the weak attempt at explaining consciousness and life in artificial intelligence. But this movie outside of being visually interesting is rather lame in plot and character development. There are a few interesting parts but as a whole it misses badly. Others have compared this to the Matrix and Bladerunner but those were real movies. This is a sad attempt at metaphysics. Don't waste your money. There much better anime movies, i.e. Cowboy Bebop and Metropolis. Its unfortunate that a lot of talented people worked on such a poor script."
2,Boring as hell,With much excited anticipation I watched this on Netflix instant-play and man was it boring. There were some good scenes but overall the story was absolutely stupid and the visuals just didn't work out well for an anime.
4,net to you,an anime must have. an introduction to an incredible movie series. It started the ghost in the shell stand alone complex.
1,Ghost of a Story,"I know that most people will disagree, but I found this movie to be wholly disappointing. While the concept is good, albeit unoriginal, the payoff just is not there. Comparing this movie to the Matrix is doing the Matrix a grave injustice. The technobabble in this anime, while necessary, often times gets a bit excessive and hokey. The segments of ""characterization"" come off as shallow and unfulfilling. Perhaps my reason for disliking this so much is because I expected much more action, of which there isn't that much(although the opening sequence is beautiful). The plot seems fragmented and disjointed at times, coming together to form what I felt was a completely contrived conclusion. To put it bluntly, there are MUCH better movies to blow your money on than this one."
3,"Its great, and its not!","Ive seen the premier Anime's, Macross Plus, Oh My Goddess, and this is the only one I didnt like. WHy? There is so much emphasis on plot that is so incredibly confusing and complex, I couldnt figure the movie out completely after seeing it 2 times. Art was supremely good, the absolute best, but try to ignore the plot if you wish to enjoy."
5,The second best anime film of all time.,"This anime film it's the second best of all time, it's very interesting, has great animation, a great story and character development, the storyline is great, also it was very exciting and suspenful, but here is my word for parents, this film contains nudity, specially at the begiing and near to the end, also it has 5 bloody and gory scenes, the violence just limits to shootings, explosions, fihgts kind of martial arts, so please i strongly recommend you to stay with you children when you see this movie. Also the DVD is great, the Dolby Digital 5.1, sounds like DTS!, the picture quality, it's very very good, but in comparsion to a little preview that is on the Manga Video promo comercial, this movie is a must see but probably not a must own"
3,"A good anime movie, but, it's very very flat","The DVD and the movie, are things that I truly recommend you to own, the animation is great, the DVD transfer it's sooooooooooooooooooo great that I feel that I am there, the sound quality is the best I had ever heard, the Dolby Digital 5.1, sounds great, it dosen't even sounds like Dolby, soudns like DTS, also the storyline it's great also, but the movie it's kind of flat, and relativly short, and it had a lot of labyrinthine, but still this movie it's definetly a must see and a most own."
5,Must see,"I wasn't familiar with Anime or Manga, Japanimation and one of my friends wanted me to see this, With a lot of hesitation,reluctance and with nothing better to do I sat down to see this. On first viewing I found it Intriguing,Mesmerizing, Interesting, Philosophical and incredibly Disturbing. The main character in my mind was so life like that I wanted to find her somewhere..a Major Kutsanagi in our midst.This film is incredible cinema and just goes to show how talented people can make the most if. Not for everyone ,some might find it boring,others might find it too long. But it is interesting nonetheless and if the first 10 to 15 mins intrigue you...your going to love this. I noticed some of Mamoru Oshi's shots that he has directed animation wise are direct rip offs off Ron Frick's Baraka, another great film. Baraka is a film of illuminating essence in its own right and I think Ghost In the Shell comes increasingly close. ranks highly on my list."
5,An Absolute Masterpiece,"Whatever you may say about anime. That it's for kids, or geeks. This film is one of the greatest of all action films. The perfect blending of computer and human art. Unlike many anime films, the voice talent on this one actually works in the dubbed version. So if you aren't into reading your films, this anime is for you. The dark imagery of the future is comparable to that of Blade Runner, so if has that going for it. And the idea of hacking into someone's brain is as imaginative as any story hook in recent memory. Anime has come a long way in the past few years. Hollywood has taken notice. This is one of the films that made them do it. Go buy it, you won't be disappointed."
2,"Stupid movie, very boring",I am a big fan of anime and was extremely dissapointed by the lack of action and suspense in this movie. See Ninja scroll
2,this blowed,"this anime was definatly overrated. The plot itself wasnt bad at all, but it had no depth, no detail. the movie was pretty much fuzzy the whole time.It doesnt make any sense whats on whatevers going on and the ending pretty much blowed. go see ninja scroll, vampire hunter d, and princess mononoke. those are real classic anime. =)"
2,Ghost in the Shell - Flash over Substance,"I would like to give this film 2 1/2 Stars, but it won't let me. I think this film is gorgeous, it is beautifully animated and backed up by a rich score. Sadly, the storyline did not live up to its surroundings. It is populated by cold and uninteresting characters. The story brings nothing new to a vast series of other anime titles with the same theme. I certainly think it is worth watching, but certainly far from the best in anime."
3,this is like the matrix?,this was a fairly decent anime film the animation was awsome but the story was a little confusing. the biggest problem i have is with people comparing this to the matrix neither film are similar other than the openings have the same green letter waterfall effect at the begining this is NOT like the matrix the matrix was NOT inspired by this movie. first off the stories and plots are completely different from each other. one thing i never understood was the fact that the main character had to be naked to go invisible but other people threw on cloths to go stealth and their cloths didn't even have to cover their bodies to cloak them. visually the movie was bad ass but i just had no clue what the characters were talking about like akira it's as if the people that made these movies expect me to have read these mangas before but I haven't so i just get confused. overall it was worth a glance not worth 25 bucks though maybe 15 or a quick rental if that's possible.
1,"Great Concept, horrible characters","Ghost in a Shell has everything going for it; unique plot, engrossing story, excellent animation, and a decent soundtrack. However it's greatest shortfall is the characters. These people seem to have no emotion whatsoever. Making it impossible to form even the slightest attachment to them, which is essential in any successful movie. The bottom line is that when the big finale happens, you could care less what happens to the characters as they are about as lifeless as the bricks on my patio outside. If your looking for something with plot, story, and characters that can get you involved in a movie I'd recommend putting this back on the shelf and getting Princess Mononoke, or Record of Lodoss war(OAV)."
2,Don't waste your time and money- see the Matrix instead,"This was a poor movie, not even saved by two, or should I say one and a half action scenes- one where the major fights an Uzi toting baddie and the end fight, with a bug-like tank. The music and environment shots were too long and horrible- as boring as Blade Runner. There are a lot of incomprehensible technotalk scenes AND lots of philosophical psycho-babble scenes. Plus, the animation is UGLY. The major looks ugly, the men look poor, and there's a lot of black. While I didn't LOVE the MAtrix, it too was confusing, it made alot more sense than Ghost in the Shell."
1,People need to share their reasons for disliking a film!,"I read many reviews for this interesting film and I find it curious that many reviewers (Not all mind you...even I have done it) are ""Bashing"" the film but fail to give any reasons for their dislike. Reviewers say that the story is confusing or hard to follow and yet they can offer no specifics. I would offer you something to ponder. Is a film good only because you can understand it? It took me 3 viewings and a double reading of the Manga (Comic Book) before I began to understand the Genius of this concept. It does a wonderful job of using the ""Ghost in the Machine"" complex well. I just wish that people would give reasons before they give films bad ratings. Have a Good Day"
5,Ghost in the Shell is top 10,"This movie was one of the greatest animes ever. it starts off very weird, but as it progresses, you begin to understand what goes on. get this movie if you are an anime fan, anime fan wannabe, or a manga comic fan."
4,Visually Incredible . . .,"""Ghost in the shell"" is a very thought provoking anime. The story line seems rather complex at first, but after watching the movie twice it has proved to be very intriguing. I really love this movie on a visual level. The blend of computer animation and 2d animation techniques has created many incredible moments. Even though I enjoy the deeply cerebral themes running through ""Ghost in the shell"", its visual splendor is what provides me with the most sustenance and inspiration. If you are looking for pure entertainment, look elsewhere, but if your are looking for an anime that proves to be extremely satisfying on many levels, ""Ghost in the shell"" is sure to please."
4,Great animation and a good but confusing plot .,"This anime made me an anime freak. Plot: A semi-confusing plot with not many twists.Animaton:Stuff that beats Evangelion simply outstanding and a cool 3D intro. Acting : Some expressionless voices but hey there robots. Parents.3 graphic sequences of action , a lot of non-sexual nudity , and moderete language."
5,The ultimate classic Manga,"The special edition 'Ghost in the Shell' is well done, however in some cases you will need to adjust the sound volume as it is very powerfull and maybe overdone as far as the balance to the effects, to voices. All in all the overal quality is great. I usualy prefer the original language versions but in this case the dub english speaking edition is fine and again done well enough to cover up that fact.There is also a second disc with interesting items and both DVD's have enough options that no mater what system you are running it can be adjusted for optional viewing. A great choice and enough sound power to shake the pictures off you walls."
2,Quite possibly the most pointless anime I've ever seen,"The first half of this was so boring I nearly turned it off -- no real science fiction, just one scene after another of gunfire and profanity with no visual impact or dramatic tension. The second half was a little better, once it started dealing with the science fiction aspects, but then it got bogged down in a confusing plot, obvious exposition, and heavy-handed philosophy that still lacked dramatic tension. Action without humor, nudity that didn't manage to be artistic OR sexy, characters that gave you no reason to care about them -- not even as eye candy. If you want an action anime OR one exploring the cyborg/human question, you'd be better off with Armitage III."
3,Reviews can be misleading,"As I sit here and type this review, I feel a little contradictory. I have read many reviews for Ghost in the Shell as well as some reviews for many other pieces of anime and some things concern me. While hundreds of people feel that Ghost is the pinnacle of anime to date, I disagree. I must admit that I'm not the consumate expert on anime, but I have found titles that have had lousy reviews that I adore, and there are titles that get rave reviews that I dislike. Personally, I prefer titles like Nightmare Campus, Demon City Shinjuku and Detonator Orgun. I purchased Ghost on DVD and it was OK. If you are a fanatic of anime, it is a must see title, but not necessarily a must own title. Rent if you can. Find your niche. Make your own opinion. Looks like I'm buying Cowboy Beebop next. I'll let you know what I think of it.Good luck."
4,Not for everyone,"Ghost in the Shell is a very profound anime, its definitely not for everyone. The action comes in bits and pieces, so action fans will be disappointed, the technology in the anime is mind-boggling, and will no doubt wow techies. But the ending would probably register a ""HUH?!"" to most entry-level viewers, since the main theme of the story is not really what you'd think it is watching the whole show(don't wanna spoil it for u :P). I'd personally reccommend it to someone who can sit through the whole movie, and at the end of it still ponder about the issues the movie brought up."
5,"A masterpiece of action and intrigue, kept me on the edge!!","An intriguing look at the future, the borders of man and machine are blurred and your left hoping that you will hear more of this future world. The subtitled version is Much better than the dubbed version, (I have both versions) the characters intonation and attitude are clearer. I Highly recommend this to action and anime fans. this is an excellent start in anime!!!"
3,Ghost in the Shell (DVD) ~ Atsuko Tanaka,Item took a little longer than the norm to arrive. The DVD was in top condition but the cover was damaged and I needed to replace it with a good one. Postage costs were fair and item cost good. Item was exactly what was described. Maybe a little better packaging would have kept my rating higher but points were lost due to cover damage.
5,One of my favorite anime movies,"From the cutting edge animation (at the time it was made) to the more than just blow crud up story, I've always felt this to be one of the most superior pieces of science fiction ever produced."
4,"An excellent anime, but not on par with its hype ...","I remember when this film came out in a limited theater run and was billed as 'Anime as good as AKIRA' which just isn't true. 'Ghost' is a good anime film, but neither the sense of diretion or detail to story puts it as a five star film. Several noticible sequences will stick in your head forever (the sluice scene, the tank scenes) but aside from those and a very memorable premise, the movie doesn't coalesce into a grand masterpiece. Rather, it should be noted as a must see for every anime fan or action movie buff, but due to some cheap anime conventions to save money this movie is unwatchable at times for non-anime fans. Beautiful art and design. Very good sci-fi plot about artificial life coming of age as an independant and dominant force in the future. I would not recommend this video to the 'lovey cutsey' anime crowd."
5,Anime to the Extreme!,"This is without a doubt the best feature film anime around. All the action and suspense you come to expect in this genre. The storyline is intriguing, to say the least. You will not regret getting this movie, watching it numerous times."
2,"Beautiful, but terrible storyline","This is one of those anime ""classics"" which puts domestic animation to shame, and rightfully so. The technical presentation is amazing. The reason I can't recommend this to anyone is the storyline bites big time. If you like waxing poetically (or not so poetically) about the inner-workings of human and machine psyches _ad_nauseum_, then get it, but I felt it all got old really quickly. Many movies have done the whole man/machine dichotomy so much better. I think the writers thought that if they kept overloading your brain with techno-mumbo-jumbo you'd think it was amazing (and apparently they were right for a majority of viewers), but for anyone who has any technical sense about them, it was just dumb."
2,Dubwar - 'Pain' (Earche Records) 2 1/2 stars,"Heard this band has had some success in Europe,so I assume they're trying for an American fan base.Their sound is somewhat complex.They combine funk,metal,punk and hip-hop.Didn't really do all THAT much for me.A couple of tracks I thought were 'okay' were ""Mental"",""Respected"" and the heavy-duty ""Spiritual Warfare"".If you're into the likes Fishbone,Bad Brains and Living Colour,you'll most likely get more out of this CD than I did."
3,Its OK,"Ok I am a serious Dub War fan and I think that the group could have done better than they did on Pain. Although a couple songs kick major ass ( and I mean major!)like Spiritual Warfare, Respected, and Pain, the rest of the album isn't about to harmonize me. Some of their songs are downright annoying. I think the boys could have done much much better. Maybe next time, eh? I will say this--If you are a really hardcore fan of Dub War, then buy it--if not, borrow it. Get Wrong Side of Beautiful or Enemy Maker instead."
3,Doesn't have good maps,"This book is colorful which is good. However, I am surprised by the fact that it doesn't provide good maps. It has brief regional maps and some area maps. However, I couldn't find most routes and attractions in the maps. Those routes are mentioned in its introduction of area attractions. The other surprising fact is that it doesn't have a subway map."
3,Cute...,"...and corny, and anachronistic, and rife with hammy acting. And the mermaid's tail wasn't very believable, and the sand shark patently stunk.But at least the acting was *deliberately* hammy...at least on the part of the three or four actors that I recognized by sight. (I *know* that all of 'em have enough talent to not make fools of themselves by *accident.*) And it's a great improvement over other Paramount kiddie fare (the ""Josh Kirby: Time Warrior"" flicks come to mind).Watch this movie from a kid's perspective, and you'll enjoy it. Trust me on this."
5,I remember when this movie was just a little baby,I was 10 when i saw this movie and i thought it was my movie i kept dreaming of it as a baby movie holding it in my arms rocking it to sleep holding it's bottle singing to it till it sleeps on my chest i keep thinking about this movie it's to bad i was seperated from it when i got older let me tell you about the story of how we got seperated it's really sad on my 11th birthday i was planning to record it then when it was that time 8:00 pm i saw the most devestating replacement it was your a good man charlie brown. I backed away from the T.V i turned of the T.v and cried on my bed and skipped my Iresttible 11th birthday and now i'm turnover 12 and i can't forget that time it turned away from behind my back but i still love it in my heart
3,"a helpful, simple introduction","I first came across this fascinating,""Reader's Digest"" introduction to world religion when a professor assigned it as a textbook for a Introduction to Western Religions class I had as an undergraduate. It is not as unbiased as it would like to portray itself as and it certainly holds more clarity when illustrated Christianity, Islam and Judiasm. Granted, it may be my personal perspective, but I found the areas of Eastern Religion somewhat convoluted and rushed.That said, ""The Religions of Man"" while out of print and really surface level in its discussions, serves as a helpfull, simple introduction to a few of the world's great religions. Let one know that there is absolutely no substitute for reading the scriptures of the various faiths and beliefs, Smith's work does indeed bait the hook of interest. Worth seeking out and reading. Not a classic, but helpful non the less."
4,People should open their hearts !,This book breifly touches on many of the Worlds established religions. It illustrates that most are quite similar and based upon the same 'universal truths'.It is interesting to look at the common threads between peoples belief systems. It is also interesting to note that pure religous ideas that promote good are later corrupted and changed as the religious movement develops and the power base shifts from the people/believers to the establishment/church. The focus then becomes wealth and market share - as opposed to the search for truth and respect for your fellow man.My view is read this book take the best from each and discard the rest.
3,Th Religions of Man,The service was fine and both book orders came promptly and were in good condition -- as advertised.
4,An Excellent Survey of the Religions of the World,"I read this book not as part of an educational requirement but for spiritual enlightenment and for personal enjoyment. I found both of these in Smith's work. This composite provides an overview of the various different religions of the world from the perspective of how to approach life and how to view one's self. Although the historical aspects of the various religions are not considered in depth, Smith does a strong job of explaining the psychological outlooks of the philosophies in an unbiased manner. He also provides a useful reference list for each chapter so that one might continue to pursue knowledge about religions of interest. The only improvements that I could see would be to include more information on the social views, historical development, and perceptions of the supernatural within each religion."
2,Hardcover Edition is not worth the price.,"Great book, but the current hardcover edition is a really tacky library edition, not bound but glued into an awful orange plastic cover. Cheap, thin bleed-through paper. Buy the paperback."
1,word calculus,"I cannot begin to explain how difficult it was to read this book. It is like Shakespeare meets JAMA. And I'm no slouch! He uses a thousand words I've never heard of and he writes in such a fussy, overwraught manner. It's like he never read ""Elements of Style"". I became so frustrated with trying to understand this book that I just gave up without finishing it. The writing lacks clarity, ebb and flow and interest. It is the most badly written book I have ever read in my life."
1,This book is hard to comprehend and is not a beginner book.,I did not find any kind of learning value in this book. It should not be used as a study guide. It is lengthened to the double by oversized words which makes it hard to comprehend and is not a book for beginners.
1,Doesn't make the cut.....,"I have to read this for my religious studies 101 class. Needless to say, I was dissappointed. This book addresses that all religions get people to the right spot, which is not true. Being religious is being in some kind of fantasy world, away from reality. Being a Christian is taking refuge in Christ and learning to FACE REALITY, not hide from it. Smith should make this clear in the next edition of the book."
4,Very Good,"I actually enjoyed reading this book, even though it was required. I learned the origin and basics of the world's dominant faiths. I think I was converted with each chapter."
4,Great book for Global Studies,"We were learning about the different religions in Global Studies, and I decided to pick this up for extra cedit. I loved it! Houston Smith's ""The World's Religions includes the main religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity as well as a list of philosophies. The information is massive and very interesting to read. I have a few complaints though. Some of the religions were merely mentioned briefly and left me frustrated. Another problem is the fact that it doesn't really give specific detail to the differences of each religion. However, other than that, it's an awesome book. I got some good information off of it and got a few extra points added to my grade by doing a report on it."
4,Excellent work,Mr. Smith's work was something I would recommend to everyone as important to complete a education. More important to help develop a greater tolerance and understanding of others in our world.
2,slow going,"Smith's book is a classic, and it is cheap - so those are some benefits. However, the book is poorly organized. It does not give you a clear outline in each chapter, and instead bounces around a little too much. The most frustrating part of the book is Smith's clear intention to make all the religions seem as similar as possible. Therefore, I think he sometimes does not give a clear picture, but instead describes the lowest common denominator.Finally, some knowledge of Christianity will be helpful in reading this book. He uses allusions from the Bible in every chapter."
2,Not all what I expected,"The book, while being a good attempt at presenting a concise overview of the main religions of the world, fails to be more than an attempt.The book tries to place itself on a very philosophical plane, thus undermining the beauty traditions and practices add to all religions. It does not even try to explain key rites in any relgion and their meaning, and instead of giving an objective overiview, came with the author's own biases and preferences.It went tooo long in parts (the asian religions) and abrupt in others (Islam, Judaism and Christianity)It did not keep momentum and was thoroughly boring towards the end. Is very repetitive and in many cases outright redundant.If you were hoping for a colourful lively depiction of the world's religions this is not for you.."
5,The World's Religions,"Insightful, thought provoking, and concise. Recommended to anyone wanting to gain a general understanding of how the world's religions work."
3,Textbook like,This book has a wide variety of different religions but is written more like a textbook. I can only read a few pages at a time and then have to come back to it. It has great information in it and is perfect for a class or for a study group.
3,Excellent book and resource,This has oddly become a book that I turn to quite a bit when watching the news. Being a baby boomer from white suburbia who grew up alongside Beaver Cleaver I find that my education regarding different cultures and religions is rather lacking. Smith has given us a great resource for a little self education.The book is well written and Smith has an obvious respect for the people about whom he writes. I'm always wary of writers on religion being prejudiced but I don't sense that here: I felt that the section on Christianity explained its tenets in a very fair minded fashion and I expect that he does the same for the other religions. I'm sure that he leaves out or adds things important to the ardent believer but for the generalist this is an excellent book and resource.
4,Start here,"Smith does a good job providing an overview of the ""essentials"" of each religion, focusing on the positive elements of each religion. His bias is usually displayed in an offhanded manner, and his enormous vocabulary makes the book a difficult read at times.I recommend the paperback version, as a quick start. For a comprehensive study of world religions, supplement with other resources."
3,Don't really recall buying this product,What can I say about this product except I don't even recall it lil alone buying it...but I do study religion and as a student of religion if this was not a satisfying purchase I would have likely posted a negative before now
5,Great Book!,Great book for those who wish to learn about world religions. User friendly. Easy to understand.
4,Begin Here,Finding non-judgemental explanations of man's different religious systems is a daunting task. This is the place. Although I'd like to find a more condensed version--actually going cover-to-cover here is a near impossibility--this is a valuable tool.
1,Stupid twelve-year-old s**t.,"This ""band"" is [...] than harvey korman. They're too lazy to write songs longer than 30 seconds, and yes, I've heard crueler and sicker lyrics. These are just dumb and incoherent. I'm surprised that their fanbase is anything but twelve-year-old boys who seem to think that Adam Sandler's sense of humor is too sophisticated and smart for them. I prefer to listen to much better structured and vastly superior Dissection instead of this crap known as [...]."
1,only one more reason,"Why don't you guys include a zero and negative (to the left of the scale) numbers? If that was allowed then this gang would get a -10. Of course there are some dead-brains of followers but...that's freedom. Anyhow, my dog could very good join this band (I heard him growling at a stranger the other day, and he licks himself here and there) and be the lead guitar. Fortunately my dog likes writing on the walls. Save your money, you can attend one of this guys concerts for free anytime by going to the car smasher, a steel mill, or getting your wife mad or if you are one of the ""band"" members by pissing off your homeboy..."
3,2 reasons to like this stuff,"1. All the songs are short so you can listen to the clips and not have to buy the album.2. The Theme from 3's company is really good.it's shock music, why get worked up over it?"
2,Not So Much Funny as it is Stupid.,"I've only heard 2 ""songs"" from this ""band"", and to be quite honest, I have no desire to hear any more. I'll admit I got a few cheap laughs, but what's funnier than the songs is the fact that people are willing to pay 18 dollars for this load of crap.To anyone considering buying this album, just read the song titles...that's about the entirety of the lyrics anyway. That way, all you're missing is the horrible ""music"" in the background. I'm not saying this because I don't like whatever genre this fits in to. I like grindcore, and I even listen to noise from time to time.If reading the songs titles leaves you wanting more, and there's no one from whom you can borrow this album, I'd suggest you forget about buying this album and just go outside and make fun of fat people. It's an equal form of entertainment, and it won't cost you a cent."
3,"A.C. think we hate them, but we just laught them","What can I say about this album? Simple and heavy instrumentals, short songs and stupid lyrics swearing everybody. Do some one really get angry with this? I just laught a lot."
3,3 stars ONLY...,"...for the song that has Phillip Anselmo from PanterA. The rest of the album is stupid, IMO."
3,"Larger than I thought, but that was my fault","I had a dive book that was a lesser dimension that I like better, this one is a bit bulky for me. That, however, was my problem for not reading the description carefully. It's a nice notebook and the bright color makes it recognizable."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,"A friend of mine lent this to me to read, and being out of reading material at the time I decided I had nothing to lose,Awful - absolutely awful. Predictable, empty-headed fluff. I ploughed on through it, but it was more of a sense of wanting to get it over with than wanting to see how it ended. THAT, I could see a mile away.Save your money, folks!"
5,For my grandson,I purchased this for my Grandson who loves to play dress-up. He was so excited to get it in the mail.
2,unfortunately . . .,"The orange astronaut outfit is very cute, but came with black stains on it and the zipper broke the first time my son wore it. We did not return it because we needed it for a costume that day."
2,"poorly made, cheap quality for the price","I was dissapointed with the quality and fit of he costume. For the high price, it is very poorly made with cheap, flimsy material, broken straps and strings commimg out of the fabric. I had to return it paying for shipping twice, costing me over $15. what a waste of time and money.I realized that there were two (or more) costumes, being sold under the same description, from different sellers, that were of better quality. Since they all have the same picture attached, it is very difficult to know which one is the good one. I finally ordered it from a warehouse who has a great return policy, and I could take it back with no questions if I did not like it. This one was good quality and is a keeper!"
2,"Zipper problems, cheap construct","We had similar problems with the zipper that other users have noted - the teeth would no longer close properly after the very first time we zipped/unzipped the costume for my daughter to try it on. I contacted the seller for a replacement, and they apologized and told me they had been previously unaware of the problem but had since heard from multiple buyers experiencing the same zipper malfunction. I was offered a partial refund if I wished to keep the costume and replace the zipper myself or a full refund if I wished to return it. We opted for the partial refund as the zipper was a very simple replacement to make, due to the suit's construct."
1,Description not true and quality is bad,"I purchased the item for my son for Halloween. The item is described as Boy's size 4-6. My son is 5 and he is considered small (about 3 ft and 2 inches tall) for his age but the suit fitted him just right. There is no way any six year old boy could have fitted in that suit. Secondly, the zipper was broken the moment my son put the suit on. The item is definitely not quality made."
2,No so good,Zipper broke the first time my son tried the costume on. He still wears it but only for short times as it get very hot (like wearing a plastic bag). Its a reasonable facsimile for the price.
1,BEWARE - VERY POOR QUALITY,"The quality of the costume was very poor. It tore when we only started to put it on my son. I will be surprised, if you have not heard this from other parents also. My son is turning 3 and is very slim for his age, and could not wear it even once. We had ordered for his birthday, but the stiching in this dress disappointed us. I feel manufacturers should get this costume checked by their quality department and pull this item off the shelf, until that is fixed."
5,grandson,Was a little reluctant to purchase but the quality was great. And my grandson is thrilled with it purchased the space ship tent
2,Product description inaccurate,"Basket arrived..but without velcro straps, no clear tray at the bottom, and no drinks holder. We used plastic ties to hold it on to the walker but it looks pretty tacky! Shopping again for another one."
4,"Carex Walker Basket excellent, tray insert is flimsy","The Carex Walker Basket has saved me many many steps in moving items from one place to another or taking items with me. The clear tray insert is great and handly - pencils and other small items don't fall out and the drink holder is a great addition - but it is too flimsy. In the few months I've had the walker basket, the clear tray insert is beginning to crack. It needs to be made of a more substantial material."
4,Golf Tips,"Good product. Some tips were well worth the buy. As ususal, some did not work for me, but would probably work well for others."
4,Good instructional video to reinforce lessons from your local PGA professional,"Organized by set up, trouble shots, short game, long game, Leadbetter gives a good background of fundamentals. There are a lot of drills that are useful, if you learn by that method. The tips are clear and concise without connfounding the user with a bunch of unnecessary details. The methods are not a substitute for a PGA professional to critique your technique.If you like his books, then the videos won't disappoint you."
4,"Una historia muy interesante, pero dejo algunas preguntas","La historia es casi increible (cual a menudo es el caso con los contactados). Aunque creo que el autor esta contando la verdad como le suceden las cosas, para mi algunos asuntos son inexplicables. Por ejemplo, nuestra ciencia nos dice, que no hay vida no en Jupiter ni en Venus ni en Mercurio, entonces el autor basicamente nos dice que hemos errado, asi cuando se encontro con los seres procedentes de estos planetas. Alguien nos dice engaños aqui.El otro problema es que lamentablemente las profecias no han cumplido. Podemos replicar que el futuro nunca es cierto y asi es imposible dar una profecia infalible. Pero en este caso los extraterrestres tienen que advertir que no es seguro, pero no lo hacen.Entonces los problemas nos no dan mucho confianza en todo esto."
4,Good resource for script samples,"This book does a pretty good job of starting you out in Windows scripting. I purchased it because I am a Windows server administrator and it looked like it would help - and it did. It has to be said that the entire text of the book is on Microsoft's web site in the Technet Scriptcenter, but sometimes you want the paper in your hands as well. Another recommendation is Advanced VBScript for Microsoft Windows Administrators (also MS Press, ISBN 0735622442) if you are looking for some goodies for Windows admin like me."
3,A lot of typos and screen mistakes,"As per most Microsoft books, untrained monkeys were used to proofread the books. I have read the first 100 pages so far, and there are numerous mistakes.It looks like a good book, I just hope I don't spend 2 hours figuring out why one of their scripts does not work, only to find it is a typo."
5,"Other books left me cold, this one is awesome!","I have bought several books on scripting..perl, C++, vbscript..you name it. None of them have ever prompted me to write a review before. This MS Press book has everything you need to script for Windows. Other books were just references. This one is not only a fantastic reference, but teaches you as well. One of my first scripts was to change the way Outlook 2002 & 2003 block attachments. The script was only 3 lines long. Easy as pie! The scripts on CD alone are worth the price of the book.If you are new to scripting and work in a windows environment, GET THIS BOOK! You can get up and going with little experience.If you are not new at Windows scripting, its a great reference.Best book in my collection!!"
1,"No longer made/grown in Hawaii, smells weird and color is different","I used Now Foods Spirulina during 2012 after using Nutrex Hawaii Pure Hawaiian Spirulina and found no real difference in taste.So end of DEC 2012 I bought 2 more bottles from Amazon and opened one up yesterday and found the smell to be very odd. It actually smells like ""doggie treats""--no joke. Also the color is a much darker green than before.Luckily I had the old bottle so I did a little comparison and found the old bottle shows ""Grown in Hawaii"" on it and the new bottle does not say anything about where it was grown.Also the new bottle says ""This natural product may have variations in color and odor."" The old Grown in Hawaii bottle does not say this so Now Foods must know that the smell and color is quite different from before.I must say I didn't even eat any tablets because it just smells awful and the smell is really strong and persistent-- not like before when the smell was mild. Unfortunately these are going into the trash."
4,Great Product,I love taking Spirulina and have done so for 9 years. It adds necessary proteins and antioxidants the body requires daily. You will feel better and have more energy. this is money well spent!
4,Love the benefits.,"I started using Spirulina apprx. 2 months ago. I originally started using the powder and plcing it in the blender with my juice and my flax seed every am. I changed to pills for convenience, but the added benefit of being regular, higher energy levels, is worth all the pill swallowing. Highly recommend, NOW brand was recommended in articles I read because of the clean source of theit algae."
5,So far very happy...,fast service. nice quality product. to me there is no bad smell. they are small tablets and there was no fowl taste in my mouth as i swished it around a minute before swallowing it. grown in hawaii it says. 500 tablets at a great price. 100% natural. freshness date of june 2013 on my bottle. bottle is tough quality made also. as a dietary supplement take 6 tablets daily but i'm starting out with less and working my way up. i'm going to spread my dosage out over the day instead of all at once. store in a cool dry place. i'm putting mine in my fridge with my other bottles of stuff.
5,Producto en buen estado,"Por ser un producto delicado, estaba preocupada por la integridad del mismo, sin embargo, llegó en buen estado y a tiempo. 100% recomendado..."
2,Not what I expected,"Guess these little critters do different things to different people. The first week I was normal. Hadn't been normal in a long, long time. But then things took a turn for the worst. Stopped me up like a glolf ball in a garden hose. As soon as I stopped I was back to my old self. No extremes either way. But at least I was GOING a few times a week. While on this product I was goin once or twice a week. Ugh! May be worth a try. Not too expensive. You may have better results."
3,Its descent for its price....,It is okay for the price i guess. The only thing it did was give me lots of bloating and discomfort.
1,"hideous taste, unlike any other spirulina","I have eaten many brands of spirulina for many years. All of them taste and smell like the sea. This brand of spirulina tastes and smells like a pig farm, and that is no exaggeration. I bought two bottles and both are the same. It is manufactured in India, probably far from the sea, so this explains it. I would never buy this brand again, and will chuck the product away as soon as I have ordered a different brand to replace it."
5,Seems to provide that little boost when I take it,"As I said on my Amazing Grass wheatgrass review ... I take 2 of these with 2 wheatgrass pills and they seem to provide an energy boost (pre-coffee) in the morning, and a pick me up after lunch as well. I've read that chlorophyll (from wheatgrass) and spirulina are good to take together, for max benefit. I can personally vouch for that regarding the energy boost aspect, and I will continue to order these organic spirulina to provide an energy boost."
1,Used to taste great - now tastes like vile pond scum,"My son and I used to buy NOW Spirulina tablets and chew them up like candy. They had a pure, agreeable taste and we both loved them. It has been awhile since I purchased a bottle and I went to Amazon and purchased the NOW Certified Organic Spirulina 500 mg 180 Tablets. When the bottle arrived I opened it up and immediately noticed a ""off"" smell coming from the bottle. Thinking the tablets would taste fine, I popped one in my mouth and it was VILE! It tastes like the most backwater pond scum sitting next to a poultry plant. There is no way that my son would ever eat these, and I certainly can't!I searched some other Amazon reviews, and apparently what has happened is that NOW used to source their spirulina from Hawaii, but now gets it from India. This apparently accounts for the bad taste. So disappointing. I'll have to find a differently source of spirulina for me and my little guy."
3,The stinky reviews are correct,"When I first opened this bottle of ORGANIC spirulina I was greeted with the foul scent of fish food or cat food. Yeah, it smells like that, and it tastes about as off. You probably won't be able to get your kids to try this stuff and if you have a weak stomach you'll need to find another brand.I bought another bottle of spirulina from Source Naturals and it smells as pleasant as the chlorella (which tastes like wheat grass to me) but still tastes less preferable than chlorella. I recommend buying from other organic brands only if you can afford it. NOW gives you much more value if you take the MG and tablet count into consideration.I wouldn't go so far as to give this a 1 star rating. I've taken nearly the entire bottle and I haven't experienced any ill side effects from the spirulina. It clearly isn't harmful -- just very unpleasant to your sense of smell and taste. Because of the cheap price it definitely deserves more than 1 star."
4,I wish I could afford more,I would like a higher daily dose. It made me feel more alive and pure. I don't mean to wax phylosophical; the effect is hard to explain.
4,Not Bad,Decent! Won't cure cancer or make you rich or attractive. It is what it is. The price is pretty decent.
3,UNSURE,"I'm unsure of what this product does, i actually stopped using it because i couldn't feel anything different. If someone has had a good experience please contact me and let me know if i'm doing something wrong."
2,Dissapointed,"The description doesn't tell you that you have to take 6 of these a day, 3 twice a day. Thought it was a good deal for the price but apparently you need the giant containers to keep up with the amount. Spirulina is a great product, many health benefits, but i'm not taking a total of 7 pills a day (6 spirulina + multivitamin). Trying a different brand next time."
2,Watered down.,"I purchased Tracy by Ellen Tracy for my mom. She previously received it as a gift from someone else and this was a replacement. It smelled similar but it's as if someone took the original and mixed it with water to make five new bottles. It does smell good but not when you compare it to the previous bottle. Maybe I just had the bad luck of getting the bad bottle but I'm returning it, my mom is happy with it."
2,Not as strong a scent as product purchased in dept. store.,"I was happy with the condition and amount of time it took to receive this product, however the scent is not as strong as the same product that had been purchased in a local dept. store.Tracy By Ellen Tracy For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 oz"
4,Fine product,"I just wish it were a little larger. It is not big enough for big-chest bras. I sort of have to fold over the bras to get them in there and it will only hold two. Otherwise, I like the structure of this little cage and it seems durable."
3,It's alright,"This was not as great of a product as I thought it would be, but it does the job. Unfortunately bra straps do get hooked on the mesh so you have to be careful taking them out. When I bought it, I thought it was a better material like a similar one I had, but was wrong apparently. For the price though, it does the job."
5,Karch is King!,"Volleyball's most decorated player in history [winner of 3 gold medals in the Olympics (2 indoor and 1 outdoor), over 130 career wins on the A.V.P. Tour, the #1 leader in career prize money,etc.], Karch Kiraly has yet another career ahead of him in writing. Karch teaches you to become a better volleyball player and the techiniques he uses to be 'numero uno.' I think it's well written and he's added more about the beach game. Everything that Karch does is 'golden!'The best thing about my copy of Karch's book is I had him sign it for me! So, go out to the next A.V.P. event or if you see him practicing, and ask him to do the same. I can't wait to read some of his other books in the near future!"
4,A Great Comedy,"I like Bette Midler more as a comedian than a singer, so it's no surprise that she shines in this comedy about the estranged parents of a bride-to-be who rediscover their passion for each other. I've watched it several times and enjoy it each time."
5,Love it!,I love this movie! It's one of my favorites. It's very cute and sweet and funny. I reccomend it to anyone.
4,That Old Feeling,"This is a great funny movie , love it watch it over and over again makes me feel good...."
4,Cute Unknown Movie,This is really a sleeper of a movie with great people in it. I was glad to find the DVD and will play if often
3,Pleasing Romantic Comedy!!,"First off, this movie is very colorful which is great. The cast wear some very vibrant and pleaing to the eyes costumes especially Bette Midler. Bette and Dennis Farina are two famous people who attend the wedding of their daughter only to find that they still love one another alot. They argue much throughout the movie. Because of her parents, the daughter ends up not being able to spend time with her husband who ends up having an affair with her father's wife. There is so much confusion but comedy here. Danny Nucci is the papparazzi who falls in love with Bette and Dennis' daughter. This movie works mainly because all of the supporting cast which includes Danny Nucci, Paula Marshall and others do well as the starrers, BETTE AND DENNIS, have very little to do but add moments of comedy when they do appear. Overall, this is a nice film for couples of any age. It is both very funny and touching at the same time and the color here once again is great."
4,Great soundtrack,I thought the movie was good. But the real thing that I really loved was the soundtrack compilation. I what you mmight call a sentimental fool for great love songs.
2,That Old Feeling,That Old Feeling is supposed to be a romantic comedy from 1997 directed by Carl Rainer. The problem with this movie is that characters are annoying and the jokes are not that funny. Everything feels fake and the story line feels unreal. Bette Midler is especially unfunny. Not a terrible movie but not a good one either. Not recommended. 2 out of 5.
2,WHAT?!?!?!?,"Okay, my wife and I just watched this yesterday and I have to say I'm shocked to see all the good reviews. I was almost in tears I was so bored. It was like a really bad 'made-for-TV' movie! I swear if it weren't for the chemistry between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina it would have been a complete waste of time...At least they were funny and natural and believable. Their daughter, played by Paula Marshall was terrible. The whole story was ruined by horrid acting (the two leads aside) and crappy dialog. When we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot (about a divorced couple played by Midler and Farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding) seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable. Boy were we wrong. This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't waste your time."
2,The missing feeling,"Carl Reiner normally makes a much better showing than this. He had all the elements, with Midler, Farina, and the gorgeous Paula Marshall, but the writing let him down big time. Spend your entertainment dollars elswhere."
2,Self-indulgent baby boomers try to act cute.,"A mean-spirited celebration of narcissism. Midler and Farina, playing the divorced parents of Molly De Mora, (played by Paula Marshall) rekindle their romance at her wedding and selfishly ruin her honeymoon. Aw, but they love their daughter, so it's OK. All the characters except for Midler, Farina and Donna are stuck with thankless two-dimensional roles where they're forced to riff on their most pathological personality traits every time the camera is pointed at them. And though this is allegedly a ""comedy,"" director Carl Reiner appears to have a political ax to grind, inserting partisan jabs at odd moments."
4,"Hilarious, well acted comedy","No one has better credentials in American popular comedy than Carl Reiner, and he's achieved a minor classic in this story of a divorced and remarried couple whose relationship shows what a fine line there is between love and hate. Bette Midler almost steals the show, but luckily the other actors are good enough to stand up to her performance. The ensemble acting is impressive, and the escalating bickering scenes between Midler and Dennis Farina are very funny. Advisory: some mildly explicit sex and occasional language, and a generally adulterous plot line. The Universal DVD transfer is very good."
3,that old feeling,"Im my feedback, I indicated the DVD would not work, but after several more attempts (2 hours), I did get it to work."
5,Love Croscill,This item was discontinued. I was able to purchase all of the other parts of the set at a retail store. This was the only piece that I was missing. Glad to get it. Very nice and completes my set.
3,Why so small?,"The pictures of this book are very good and the text fits well, however, having copies of the other two books in this series, ""The Life Of Christ"" and ""The Old Testament"", I was a bit dissapointed with the size of this book. The publishers seem to be attempting one of those ""gift"" books and in doing this they do a great disservice to the artist."
4,Orphan Star is a worthly sequel to The Tar-Aiym Krang,"Orhan Star is the sequel to The Tar-Aiym Krang. We find Flinx, no longer a poor orphan, chasing a merchant to Hivehom and Terra in search of information about his parentage. His chase leads him to Ulru-Ujurr, a planet under Edict from the United Church, ostentisbly because it contains a highly intelligent telepathic race. There, with some typical Foster excitement, a battle is fought and won. Orphan Star is a little slow in the middle, but the exciting and illuminating ending makes up for it. Foster's new aliens are very interesting and would make a good study for a novel on their own."
3,Orphan Star,"Orphan StarThis, the third book in the Pip and Flinx series, tells of how Flinx starts on the path to finding who his berth parents were/are. It also introduces us to the angle -devil child. And, to the Ulru-Ujurrs.I liked some things in this book, like the fact that, afterwards he realized that civilization is not necessarily the best thing in the universe. And, while I like them, I find the Idea of the Ulru-Ujurrs a little far-fetched."
5,Recién empece a leerlo y ya deseo terminarlo,"Un excelente libro, apenas empece a leerlo y estoy con ganas de terminarlo ya, desde que inicia te envuelve en el ambiente en el cual se desarrolla, una historia bastante buena, voy a aprender mucho con este libro."
3,ok compilation,"This is actually a compilation of singles and b-sides. Of the b-sides, Black Breath stands out."
1,"If the warrenty is up, or you dammage it your out of luck!!!","This isn't so much a review as it's a warning to potential buyers of Meade products. This is a $1,000.00+ telescope after shipping, but Meade considers it to be disposable. I called Meade to get a replacement part for it and I was told that they don't stock any replacement parts and don't repair this line of telescopes. If the problem is warranty related they said they will replace the whole telescope but other then that they don't offer any support. They wouldn't even suggest any recourse."
1,3 out of 3 failed,"We've had 3 PCs with ATI Radeon X600 Pro 256 MB and all of them stopped working in less than 3 years time. The company asked long list of questions reaching to what game from which company I am playing, even though problem was happening with multiple games. They simply replied then asking me to check with game manufacturer, check hardware specs, udpate driver, check knowledge base and lots of other things which have all been addressed in their long trouble ticketing form.And even when it was alive, I wasn't getting best performance.Couldn't be worse."
5,WOW!,"I'm a fan of David Blaine and picked this up at the Library. I started reading after dinner and finished the book at 11 p.m. I just couldn't stop reading -- was totally mezmerized! For those who have studied magic or are more familiar with famous magicians, perhaps this book covers old ground. But for someone like me who enjoys Blaine's magical stunts and personality but who didn't know much about the old-time magicians in the book, it was totally fascinating! The photos, illustrations, and artwork on the pages also help to make it an interesting read. Highly recommended!"
1,blaine's greatest illusion ....,"is to get people to buy this book. I'm a huge fan of his and was really looking forward to something meaningful and interesting. Did I expect the secrets of his illusions revealed? No. But what I didn't expect was a history of magic (which was boring), a Houdini biography (which someone else, has probably done better), nor a bunch of self-congratulatory chapters. All one really gets out of this as far as his life is concerned, is that he really loved and still misses his mother. I already knew that he jagged around in Europe and practiced magic, had a bunch of oddball friends (duh, they are magicians after all), he planned and trained really hard for his stunts, and network TV paid him bunch of money to go to exotic places to do magic and witness different cultures. I recommend spending 20 minutes in a bookstore, reading the couple of chapters that have any relevance, and letting someone else buy it."
3,Geared more toward young adult fans,"This book was ok. I felt it was really written for young fans who might want to follow his footsteps. There is a bit of history here, as if to show Blaine is respectful of the past masters and not cocky. Not completely dull, I remember he does give a least one simple trick as a bone, but not extremly compelling - perhaps that is part of the point, the craft is not all glamour and is laden with repetitive training & hard work. Try to get it at the public library unless you are a fanatic about this guy."
5,This book is amazing,"This book is a mind-blower. Open it anywhere and start reading (which is how I read a lot, I'm pretty ADD) and you'll have a hard time putting it down. Each time I open the book, I end up sitting there with my jaw dropping open, and saying ""Holy @#$%&*! Listen to this!"", a lot. Blaine talks about magic in history, about the most astounding magicians and their lives, about the dedication it takes to do this. He talks about his own life, and his travels and some really bizarre stuff he's seen and done. After seeing footage of him on the street, I had come to the conclusion that he was from another planet. Evidently he's not really magic or non-human. One thing I'm getting out of this book is what an extraordinary amount of dedication and passion magicians have, and just how many thousands of hours it takes them to get this good. This book is really fascinating. Plus, who knew the guy could write so well, too?"
1,A Let Down of Epic Proportions!,"This is an awful book! There is nothing remotely ""fantastic"" about the furniture they have ""redone."" In fact, judging by the few ""before"" pictures available, the ""artists"" have ruined this furniture! We're talking about a dining table decoupage with scraps, patio chairs draped with bath towels, & beautiful antique pieces ""revived"" with foo-foo, over-the-top paintings! All I can say is that I'll wait patiently for them to grow weary of their new finishes; then I'll snap the pieces up at garage sales, flea markets & junk stores to refinish them with dignity & restore them to a proper finish!!"
4,About half are a joy,"Raise the main-mast and ready the mizzen; man the helm and steer'er south-south-west. Strengthen your seaman's vernacular as you make your way through these wonderful thirty four short stories (taken from larger novels) of a time past when the great sailing ships ruled the seas. There are also occasional illustrations by Peter Hurd.The stand-outs are from Hans Christian Anderson, James Boyd, Frank T. Bullen, Daniel Defoe, Alexander Dumas, Victor Hugo, Charles Kingsley, Jack London, Pierre Loti, John Masefield, Guy Murchie, Jr., Charles Reade, and Morgan Robertson.Wish you wellScott"
5,My Kids Loved This One!,"We have all of the Backyardigans DVD's... not only do my kids love them, but so do me and my husband. My kids, who are two and three particularly loved this one because they were familiar with the fairy tales. Le Master of Disguise is their next favorite on this disc."
3,Not my favorite but the kids love it.,"This is probably my least favorite movie out of the six we own. I find that after just one play through I am already tired of movie. It does not get a repeat playing in a day.My daughter disagrees with me, she loves this almost more than all the others and asks for this only behind Mighty Knights. She especially enjoys the first episode, singing along with the characters and dancing to the music.For me the score would have been two stars, she would pick four, so we gave it a three."
1,Never received item,Never received...have been trying to get Amazon to help me for a couple of weeks...
4,Pure East Trance,This man is the best DJ the Asian East has to offer! The sounds flow and the beat is movin. A great Trance CD...check out track 5...its a style u never heard before. Buy it if you love a smooth bumpin Trance CD.
1,Contains potentially dangerous misinformation,As a newish rider keen to learn I bought this among many other books. Everything sounded pretty reasonable until Mr Jaehne described trying a corner one gear higher than he had previously been able to manage it and was SURPRISED when it didn't work out! A man who comes off after attempting a corner ten [not one tenth] miles an hour faster than his prevous best and who is surprised should not be teaching. For two really good books try Code's 'Twist II' and Hough's 'Proficient Motorcycling'. As a more experienced rider [I commute through Hong Kong traffic even during typhoons and I keep a CBR900 on the track] I think there is a lot to it - ask Kenny Roberts - Mr Jaehne's pamphlet really doesn't do the subject justice.
4,useful information,This book although being rather concise is filled with useful information. Jaehne seems to genuinely want to make us better riders in the setting we see the most: the street. The foul weather riding section will help all riders to enjoy more riding time and improve skills.
2,The novice riders pamphlet,"This handbook (a mere 60 pages on dry weather riding, 30 pages on wet weather riding) really only offers a two pieces of advice: keep the bike at an optimum weight balance and take late apexes. The rest pretty much boils down to a combination of MSF course work, common sense, unentertaining stories, and mainstream motorcycling magazine backbiting.Overall, an underwhelming read and not very useful to an 'advanced rider'.- George"
2,"If You're A Serious Sportbiker, Pass On This One","I bought this in spite of the other (negative) reviews I saw listed. It's a small softbound book, and I gave up on it after 3 pages."
3,"This book's OK, but mainly common sense.","I feel that you could get more out of the ""Twist of the Wrist"" series, where you learn to analyze your riding and think for yourself, than from this book. The author lets you know how bitchin' he is, and then flings some anecdotes and common sense at you. There's some good information, but nothing anyone with an average IQ couldn't figure out after a bit of riding and thinking about what she is doing. If you've got the money to spare, by all means buy the book and support the ""how-to riding book"" industry. There's always something you can learn from a book like this. I just don't think it's a ""Five Star"" book. I feel riders sometimes overrate books and videos of this sort because riding is dangerous, and we like to feel that by reading a book or watching a video we have an edge or talisman against disaster. I read/watch every one I find, and this is the least valuable one I own."
2,"Read it if you can get it at the library, but don't buy it","Incredibly over-priced! This book couldn't have taken him longer than a day to write (as the poor editing and horrible style suggests).I was able to pick up about 5 new ""tips"" to help me with general safety, but just not enough content. Frankly, he should just stick to riding a bike and stay away from his word processor. Or hire a freakin' editor for crying out loud!On a positive note, he did provide numerous ""real-world"" anecdotes where he described rides where certain ""close calls"" occurred and how he managed to avoid disaster. There was also a good section of the book dedicated to riding in the rain."
3,Fab Idea - Needs Mature Writing,"I've read the trilogy three times now, and although I really enjoy the books, the flaws bother me. (1) physical details that don't add up and (2) lack of plot & character complexity.Just to mention a couple of the physical problems: what are they eating? It is not possible to grow enough food in greenhouses to support a population (even with meat). What is pollenating those plants? The author should have created a couple of native root/nut staples.Another problem, the characters are constantly melting snow in their mouths to drink. No one experienced in severe cold climates does this. It takes too many calories and drops your body temperature. Which brings up another thing - where are the real cold adaptations: double doors, quilted clothes, stove beds."
5,Must have for NYC visits,"Whether it is your first trip to New York City or you are a regular visitor, this map is a must have. It folds small enough to fit in a pocket or purse but folds out so you can really find your way around. The map includes a Manhattan subway map, detailed street maps of downtown and central Manhattan & smaller diagrams of Greenwich Village and the neighborhoods. Places of interest and attractions are clearly marked. Every inch of every side is printed with information yet it is very easy to understand and use. I keep an updated version for easy access whenever I travel to the city."
3,The owners manual you didn't get with the software,"This is a straight vanilla manual. It is ACT 101 and completely basic. If you already know ACT and can play with some of the new features in 2007, you could live without this. If you are new to ACT, then this is a very necessary book.Not helpful to power users."
2,The Never-Ending Plot Scam,"What type of author cannot resolve a plot in 800 pages? Not a good one. What kind of publisher publishes such an author? Same answer. What type of author and publisher uses the ""never-ending plot"" as a pathetic way to get readers to spend money on the ""sequel?"" Tad Williams and DAW Books. Will it work on this avid science fiction reader? No.With that, the story itself was good and I appreciate the oh-so-rare African lead character."
1,I found this book to be utter drivel.,"OTHERLAND is the first book by Tad Willaims that I have had the misfortune to read. On the other hand, if it is his best, then I shall count myself lucky to have been saved from reading any of his other works. I found the book both boring and disjointed. To give the author his due, howvever, one must marvel at how he was able to fabricate 770 pages of meaningless claptrap"
1,Disappointed Fan,"I'm a huge fan of Tad Williams. I loved his Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn Series. But this book is a long boring thing.Please Mr. Williams, go back to writing fantasy novels rather than this drab science fiction with characters that mean nothing to me."
4,"Good, long, cut","The book is very good, imaginative and shows a very interesting future. I only regret that it ends exactly when things start rolling. If you don't like long descriptions don't buy it, but I can tell you that I'm buying the second part."
3,Not bad at all.,"This book may have been painfully slow, but that didn't stop me from taking a day off from work because I couldn't put it down. Few books, of this genre especially, bring me back to buy expensive sequels. Tres bien, Williams.Best attributes: the characters. They are vibrant.Slow? Awkward? Meandering? These are all words that accurately summarize Otherland: City of Golden Shadow. To a certain extent, this is forgivable. This isn't a novel that is served well by a fast pace. Other novels with more ... predictable structures can lose me as a reader if I'm too busy. Not this one, though. Like the world it depicts, this novel is consuming to the nth degree. I just wish Williams' editor had convinced him to axe about three hundred pages. Maybe I would have gotten more work done. <wink>"
2,Yawn,"Where are the good editors??? It seems we are being innundated with a sea of thick, overly long books that have decent thin books inside them struggling to get out. Unfortunately, Tad loses this struggle. I'll probably read (skim) the sequel but only because there's not enough good stuff out there to keep me going for long.It's really too bad because I loved his Memory Sorrow and Thorn series. Oh well."
2,Maybe it's just because I don't like cyberpunk...,"I picked this book up with high hopes, because I loved the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn Trilogy. I made it through about 1/3 of this one before I gave up from intense boredom. I didn't care about ANYBODY. I'm holding out for another trilogy in the MS&T world, but I'm not holding my breath, since I guess Williams is finishing this one first."
1,If you value your soul don't buy this book,"Maybe the title of this review is a little extreme, but I had to get my point across about what a bad book this was. I usually don't mind reading a long book, but I found as I progressed through this story that goes nowhere, the book was slowly sucking the life out of me. This book revolves about several dull and boring characters who really have no connection with each other. I guess if you like waiting four books for a climax, this series is for you. With vague hints of some far reaching conspirancy that is child-like in its attempt to be suspenseful, this book leaves a lot to be desired. I definately won't be buying the rest of this series, and I'm tempted to ask the publishers to re-imburse me for the hours of my life wasted reading this book."
4,"This is not a book, it's a beginning...","The main thing you must understand is that City of Golden Shadow is not a long book...it's a long beginning to a more than 3000 page book. Don't even think about picking it up unless you're willing to go all the way through it.At the end of the City of Golden Shadow, I was a little confused but still curious. By the middle of the next book, I was hooked. Williams is creating a HUGE world and taking his time doing it. I can only say that if you have the patience to fully explore Williams' creation, it is worth it."
3,Plodding through,"Tad Williams wrote an unconventional fantasy series with the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn titles.He obviously attempts to do so again with a sci - fi / fantasy blend through Virtual Reality.He may be onto something here, but unfortunately, like the first book in his other series, this book is downright painful to slog through sometimes...slow plot, and character development.When it's good, it's really good. when it's bad, it's merely methodical and sluggish.You may need a bit of patience to read through the first book. If you can sit and read a couple hundred pages in a sitting then the book will probably move along fairly quickly.Overall, I will definetly recommend this book in softcover since it doesn't cost much.Honestly, the plot is so sublime, in all truth, I'm still not really sure what the book is about !I am reading the second book more out of curiousity to see what happens than because of any great love of the story or characters....I think that says it all."
5,This is a FAT book!,"When I first bought the book, I didn't have the slightest idea of what it was about. It was the first time I judged a book by it's cover. When I started to read the foward I was intrigued, for one thing book's back cover said it was a Si-Fi novel, but the foward described a fantasy like castle. When I reached the middle of the book I finnaly got some answers. All in all it is a well writen book, and makes you think twice about the internet it's power. One thing I would recomend to do is to by both the first and second volumes of this seires, because the end leaves the reader in a little suspence."
4,Very Interesting,"I'm not quite sure why I picked this book up as I usually don't read futuristic scifi type novels, but I found the story to be intriguing. Although the book does follow the stereotypical good vs. evil plotline, I found the characters to be well developed and likable. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the virtual reality net of the future. The way in which Williams includes a news excerpt at the beginning of each chapter is also a nice touch. It conveniently allows the reader to get a feel for the world in which his story takes place without him having to work such descriptions into the storyline. Overall, a very interesting book."
3,"Brainless, but Good Read","This is an interesting story, but one that I would recommend only to fans of the cyberpunk genre. It is very wordy, and unfortunately the prose isn't particularly compelling. The ideas are not exactly new, but if you like that sort of thing, the execution is great. Brainless, because everything is spelled out for you, nothing is really there to consider, or wonder about. Most of the characters are likable, sympathetic or not. I sometimes wonder what will happen when a really good writer [not just a good visionary] gets a hold of this genre, or perhaps more appropriately, sub genre."
5,An excellent SF epic.,"Otherland Vol. I is an excellent and highly imaginative blending of SF and Fantasy which can proved a great deal of enjoyment for readers who don't have the wrong expectations. This is not actually a complete book but merely the first fourth of a gigantic story being published in 4 parts. Unlike some other massive sf adventures on this scale (David Wingrove's Chung Kuo for instance), Otherland does not cover the lives of dozens of characters over the course of several years, but only a handful of characters over a span of time measured in days. Needless to say the story is extremely detailed and progresses slowly toward its goal. Reader's expecting a speedy resolution to the story's plot will be disappointed. Rather, enjoy each moment for what it itself contains. Even as the main story thread procedes slowly forward, interesting events occur on the charcters lives. This story is a long road, but the real joy in it is the journey."
2,Slow and cliched,"This book takes forever to develop. Unfortunately, there is nothing startling or new to reveal. It is the same thing we have seen before. I was thouroughly unimpressed with the plot when the extensive character development allowed for any. I don't need to know every detail about every bit character in the story. Find an editor and cut down on the gibberish."
3,It just left me hanging...,"I HATE IT when individual novels in a series can not stand alone. This book ends right in the middle of what is clearly a larger book -- no thumbs up from me. But I admit, it had me completely involved and I will read the next book, but only after reviews convince me that it actually has an ending"
5,the best book ive ever read,this is so good that when i got close to finishing it I started reading slower and less frequently just because i didnt want it to end. the story and the characters became an obsession occupying my thoughts entirely.read this book you wont regret it
1,Otherland. City of Golden Shadow,"A disappointing book. I suffered through 700+ pages of the disjointed adventures of a number of principle characters in the expectation that towards the end, the individual stories would be pulled together with some reasonable explanations providing some satisfactory closure to the story.No such luck.What made it more disappointing was that with so many loose ends left dangling at the end of the book, some of the more obvious issues with the storyline become even less acceptable.There was too much ""filler"". The book could easily have been half the size with no loss of relevant information.However, even at half the size, the fact remained that as a reader I had been cheated out of a storyline ending.Expecting me to buy the next book in the series and potentially be left ""hanging"" yet again at the end, is to presume that I have some masochistic reading disorder.Shame on you Mr. Williams. You could have, at least, provided me with some value for the money I spent."
2,Nothing but a rehash of Fairy Tales in VR,"I could not finish this book. I cared nothing for the characters and was very disapointed with the fact that the whole story seem to be snippets and themes of Alice in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk and Pinnoccio all wrapped up in a VR world that Big Tad seems unable to translate well into text form. This is the first book in 6 years that has interested me so little I didn't care to know the out-come."
2,What the...?,"Yet another story rehashed, given a new face, a cover, and thrown on to the shelves. The only imaginative component of the story was the voyage into cyberia, the rest of the ""who did that and why"" has been sung, said, and written by all those between the ages of 5 and 65. Disappointed in the book, expected much more from Tad Williams after the triumphant Memory, Sorrow, & Thorn trilogy and the creative Tailchaser's Song."
1,Worst Waste of My Time - E V E R,"I do not understand the rave reviews this author gets for this series - I never even got through this first book, which says something because I love to read and I always give an author the 'space' they need to get the story going. What a snoozer! B-O-R-I-N-G. I can't believe this series is getting such high marks from other readers - do you have NOTHING else to do but sit and collect dust while reading this stuff? I've 'survived' other boring series beginners, such as The Hobbit (come on - its boring 'til you get about half way through!), but I couldn't bring myself to care at all about the main character, let alone anyone or anything else in the book. I wasted money buying all (3) books together - soon to be donated to the local library. Don't waste your time..."
2,Couldn't finish it,"This is the second Tad Williams book I've attempted and it will also be the last. It's not that I can't read long books - see my other reviews. Based on all the positive reviews for Tad I thought there must be something worthwhile. I attempted The Dragonbone Chair and just couldn't get through it. I thought that since Otherland was written later, maybe Tad had gotten better. Nope. It's not that he's a bad author, he just isn't good. The storyline is decent enough. Unfortunately the author doesn't offer anything to keep me reading. He doesn't have interesting characters, there's nothing smart, witty, alluring... anything to keep me going. He took a decent premise and didn't add anything to it."
1,Read this series if you have absolutely nothing else to do.,"Williams, although obviously a talented writer, seems like the kind of person who probably talks merely to hear himself talk. If they were 1/4 their present length, the first two volumes of the Otherland series might be worthwhile. As they are, much of the story is boring, superfluous, irrelevent, tedious, and ultimately, a waste of time. I read these books on a beach, with nothing else to do, and still mostly hated them."
2,"Too long, too boring","A story that essentially could have been told in one book has been stretched out to FOUR!!! I thought book one was bad enough, but book two is even worse. I'm planning on putting all of them up for sale on Amazon. Truly dismal. Such a shame as his 'War of the Flowers' series is marvellous."
1,This Book Sucks,"What kind of jerk writes an 800 page novel without a denoument? Around page 700, I started losing interest in the book... But I figured I'd read that much, I might as well finish it.I'm sorry I did. No resolution to anything anywhere in the book. I understand it's the first of a 4 part series and you want to get me to read the next one... but all it did was guarantee I'll never pick up another book by Tad Williams again."
1,How bloody boring!,"I have to admit that I have never read another of Williams works before, but this is horrible! There is no action, no plot to hold the characters together. Occasionally, Williams stumbles across something that could be worthy of a story, but not with these characters. My advice: Don't waste your time, if you want a good read try the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan."
2,"Fantasy, not SF","Make no mistake, though the book claims to be cyberpunk, Otherland should be classified as fantasy. My dislike of the book stems from my dislike of fantasy's ""anthing goes"" conventions. I rarely fail to finish a book, but given the ponderous pacing of the story, a cast of unlikeable characters, and knowing that I'd have to read another 1800 to 2000 pages to complete the story, I quit this book after about 550 pages."
1,"Warning- This book is very, very BAD!","I loved Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn (I am currently reading it for the third time), which made me very excited to see that Tad Williams had wrote another series. Unfortunately, City of Golden Shadows was awful. It was one of the most boring books I have every read and I will definitely not be reading the sequels. I felt no connection to the characters and even started to hope for their demise just so the book would end. Which is a shame because I think the development of characters was Williams' strength in Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn. I cannot understand how so many people wrote such good reviews of this book, do they not know what a good book is? Although it is definitely, more science and computer oriented then I like, which may account for why I hated the book and others really loved it. I would recommend not reading this book, actually I would recommend reading my statistics textbook before reading Otherland."
1,A talking breakfast,"I plodded (forced) my way thru 3/4 of this book, but when I got to the scene with the TALKING PLATE OF BACON n' EGGS, that was when I put the book down and never picked it up again."
1,utterly Bizzare,"I lik the science fiction genre bu this was bad, and i'm a tolerant reader. This book was recomended to me and i began it with gusto. I hated it after page 150. It was so bizzare i had to force myself to read it. Dont even pick it up."
4,An excellent tale which captivates the imagination,"Tad Williams spins an incredibly deep, rich story in this book which is masterful in its complexity. Layer upon layer of detail, many threads of plot all interweaving, so that just as you THINK you've figured it out, you're thrown for a loop again. I found it hard to put down, because it was so fascinating, but at the same time, had to read it it slow chunks to give my mind time to process it all. People who like to read fast and get it done with -- this is not for you. This book is like a glass of fine wine, you sip slowly and appreciate all of the flavors over time. Unfortunately this can lead to losing a portion of the audience if you have a short attention span. Sometimes it's a bit too complex, but overall, it's another great book from a very talented author."
5,He did it again!,"How does he do it??? And I thought War and Peace was the longest book I was ever going to read! After reading Tailchaser's Song and Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, I never dreamed that Tad Williams could ever out do himself again...but he has! Once I started Otherland, I couldn't stop reading until I had read from cover to cover. And now I have to wait for the next segment to come out in July!!!!! I, for one, am counting the seconds until that book comes out. In the meantime...well...I suppose I'll just have to read the book again!"
5,Loved it!,"Tad Williams is at his best creating fantasy out of modern reality. Here he creates a virtual world, an internet run amok, that draws the reader in. It seems a very long story at first glance, but it is really a series of tales linked into a common thread. Each story can almost stand on it's on -- this would make a great TV series. As in The War of the Flowers, Williams seems to have a dark view of the future, and he writes well enough to put you in that mood if you forget that it's just a story. This is not a quick read, but it is worth your time."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Tad Williams decided to try something epic, yet again. Four volumes ofthis time science fiction, but throwing in epic fantasy quest elementsby way of virtual reality environments to keep the rest of his fanbasesomewhat happy, at least.A disparate group of people set out to find out why a whole lot ofchildren are getting sick and falling into comas. These people comefrom all over the globe, an African student, a native bushman, a youngsick computer game geek, a French researcher, etc.In the real world, the police also begin to suspect something after an odd series of murders."
3,Great book if you can get past the page numbers,"I recently read this book and quite enjoyed it. Despite it's hefty size it provides an excellently realized story and setting that really allows the reader to become involved with the plot. After having read this I find myself wondering what our world would be like if our internet were advanced to the point where one could literally plug himself into the internet and interact with every thing on such an advanced level. Warning to all potential readers...this is only the first book, and they all keep on getting longer. Unfortunatly the first book does not end cleanly, which means that in order to get to an ending you have to read the whole seires. If you have the stamina to get through it by all means read it, if not, try something a bit lighter."
3,"Cool cyberspace concepts, flat characters","Williams evolves the cyberspace genre nicely in this first novel in the series. From the first scene, the depth of his world demands that you enter it. You won't find here the neon Tokyo of Gibson, or the jouvenile toys of Stephenson. The cyberspace environment, and the stories played out within it have a more considered, grown-up texture. That said, I found the villains far more interesting than the heros. Williams over-compartmentalized the personality traits of his heros, and they lack depth and an intangible degree of internal inconsistencies which make characters more believable. In fairness the villains probably suffer the same type of development. It is easier to forgive this of the villains, though, as we more often expect the bad guys to be mysteriously faceless. Overall it is an entertaining read, with characters that leave you a bit wanting."
3,Fascinating...but Boring!,"The world created in this book is amazing. I was totally pulled in by Tad Williams' imagination and solid writing, though not until I was a third of the way into the book. It took so long because the book is a slow, slow read. There were way to many narratives. While it's details that make a fantasy book, there's such a thing as too many details.This book should have been 1/2 the size it is.I'm terribly curious about what happens next, but I can't bear slogging through 3 more volumes!"
2,Extremely disappointing,"If the whole set of 4 books had been 770 pages long, it would probably still have been too long. We can hardly be expected to chase 2800 pages after such a scrawny carrot. The Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy was beyond a doubt my favorite serious of books in any genre. It's unfortunate that Tad couldn't pull this off, even with such a fascinating premise. There's a 30% chance I'll buy the second volume, only to give him a chance to redeem himself -- and because I've invested too much time in volume one not to!"
2,Terrible ending.,"This book kept me interested enough to read through to the end, but I think that was a mistake. The ending cut the story line short of its conclusion, and offered a pedantic observation of the obvious instead. I feel cheated, like I have wasted my time reading this rather large volume."
2,"interesting concept, but a tedious read","Very interesting concept, but as I slogged through page after page of seemingly irrelevant paragraphs and pages I found that the book ceased to be enjoyment and relaxation but rather a work in endurance. The story takes forever to develop; 3/4 of the way through I bagan to doubt that a good quantity of what I what reading was important to the overall story, and therefore I began to just skim through pages. It can be easy to get lost as well, given the many rabbit trails throughout the story. Of course they say when you reach the mountain top you can clearly see the path it took to get there - perhaps by the 4th book it all becomes clear. I don't think I have what it takes - patience, endurance - to challenge the other 3 books. The 1st one defeated me."
3,Really Long Virtual Trip,"Tad Williams writes in the introduction that this book was not an easy effort. It's not easy to read either! I bought it because the storyline intrigued me: Virtual Reality threating Real Life, Conspiracy, etc. Unfortunately reading it was less intriguing: The story is broken down into little pieces, jumping between a confusingly large number of narratives, often seemingly unconnected. At times the story stalled, meandering around, without discernable direction, indulging in (admittedly colourful) descriptions.Two positive points about the book were characterization and vision. Orlando, !Xabbu and Renie are unique and beautifully realized. The descriptions of future VR technology is captivating, I was espcecially fascinated by the Beezle character, the Gel-Vaults and the concept of VR alternative world-building.Will I read the second installment? If only I knew."
4,A wonderful work of science fiction,"This book contains an interesting plot concerning society in the future. The internet plays a large role in society, to the extent to where it's a virtual reality-type setting. After Reni's brother becomes victim to a coma (presumably as result of a huge internet conspiracy) Reni, with the help of her bushman friend !Xabbu, set off to find out who has caused her brother to fall into a coma. This is a wonderful work of sci-fi, which I would recomend to anyone. The book seems long, but if you're an avid reader, you won't be able to put it down. The only downfall of this book is that it abruptly ends, so you have to immeadiately have to run out to buy the second one to find out who the internet conspirators are, and why they are putting children into comas over the internet."
4,I Couldn't Put It Down and Nearly Died of Starvation,"This is one large book, but it is most certaintly worth the treck. It is my first Tad Williams novel, and I was blown away by this guy's attention to detail. If your into SF or Cyberpunk or mysteries in general this is a titanic must read. Williams weaves an astonishing web of characters who come together in a chilling tapestry. I recommend it."
2,Don't bother,"This novel does have interesting characters. The various settings and the world of the near future that Williams imagines are very creative and well done. But the premise of a ""Grail Brotherhood"" spending billions of dollars on a secret project spanning decades of time with only one man apparently noticing is ludicrous. And he does not know what their objective is? Gimme a break. Lets see. The bad guys are all so old they can hardly function. They have an unhealthy interest in children. They already control the world. I am not going to read the second book but will go out on a limb and predict they want IMMORTALITY! I read 770 pages just so I could guess the objective? Never again with this author."
4,Slow but got better,"Otherland started out slow and uneventfull. Further as I read into it, it had gotten better and better. The facinating ideas in the book were just fabulus and kept me wanting to know what happens next. It's got me hooked untill the next book in the series comes out."
5,A Fantastic Voyage into the Net,"I just want to make a few comments on Otherland: City of Golden Shadow. The other reviews I read cover most of what I would have said. I just want to stress the intricate way this novel is written. It is the writing that makes this story so fascinating. Williams' creativity, characterizations, and plotlines help this book become a masterpiece, but very occassionally, it is slow. The other three novels should tell if this series will be a classic. I expect it will be, at least in the science fiction genre"
4,A Good Start,"Although not Williams' best, Otherland: City of Golden Shadow is a very good read. As in his Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy, the reader has to follow a multi-threaded story about a bunch of ""normal"" people who rise to the challenge of a seemingly omnipotent foe. Most of the characters are interesting enough that one wants to know what happens to them next; the only exception is (for me) the bushman !Xabbu who could just drop dead as far as I am concerned. Now that the characters are immersed in Otherland, I hope that Williams will make more use of fantasy elements and thereby top this first volume."
5,Great author - great book !,"This is the best novel about the future of the net! Tad Williams (who could not write a bad book - even if he tried) starts a series that is at least as gripping and suspensefull as his ""M,S&T""-series. It ends with a cliffhanger and we will have to wait at least another two years to see the end of the story (in volume four) but it is really worth the wait !"
3,A scary look at where the Net could be going,"I would have rated this book 5 stars if I hadn't found out at 3am this morning that it is the first of 4 books and that the last 2 are not published yet. I travel a lot and only take paper backs so now I will have to wait years (?) to find out what happened. The story has multiple character with their own story lines and, in one volume, it works, but having to track across 4 volumes that won't all be available at one time until ??? means, for me, I will just stop with the first one."
5,One of the best series out there.,"Otherland is such a fantastic, impressive, amazing story. Anyone who likes fantasy and/or sci-fi will (hopefully) love this series. The first book, City of Golden Shadow, introduces the reader to the near future where technology has improved greatly, even more than one may expect. Not only is the world interesting but the characters are as well. Each one is unique and intriguing.This book, and the series as a whole, is just wonderful. It may be my favorite series of all time!"
5,"An intricately woven, well thought out series.","This first installment of the Otherland series was one of my first introductions to this contemporary renaissance of fantastic fantasy/sci fi writing.There are so many characters slowly added in this first book, that one would think it would muddle the story line and make it confusing, but this is not so. Every character he introduces adds a new layer to the plot, and new facet of humanity or cruelty. I loved that the books were so long- it meant it took longer for the series to end. By the last book, I had a hard time picking it up, because I felt like every page I read meant one less day living in the world of Otherland."
4,This novel made me a Tad Williams fan.,"I found this book slow going at first but was eventually hooked by the entertaining story line and great characterizations. I am now on Book 2 and it is even better. I worry about who might get killed off! I had never heard of Tad Williams before, probably because I have spent the last several years catching up on the Wheel of Time. ( I started reading Book 1 of that before realizing it was a series.) After reading this novel, I am seeking out Tad William's other novels."
2,Chapters slow to a crawl...,"The book has enough ""a-ha!"" moments throughout its chapters to keep you trudging through. Unfortunately, this was literally the only book I've ever seen where reading 400 pages yielded about a paragraph of information. The titular ""Otherland"" isn't even mentioned until after the halfway point of the book.The book as a whole is just a dense block of text - all mass and no volume."
2,Think of all those trees....,"Picking up this book should have been the first hint when I decdied to buy it. The binding is two freakin' inches. But no, I decided I didn't care about length, after finishing a few Terry Goodkind books, an 800-page book just doesn't matter.Boy, was I wrong. I tried, I really tried to read it. I gave it a valient effort, but I just died in the process and trying to read this book nearly killed my interest in fantasy epics (my only saving grace was the prospect of reading Song of Fire and Ice). I only got 350pgs into it. NOTH-ING HAPPENS. Nothing, end of story. Yes I know it had great description and the characters are deep and blah, blah. But honestly don't waste your precious life trying to read something that needs 500 pgs or so to get into the real plot line.I recommend Robin Hobb's works, but that's just me :)"
2,"Sadly, I also found this a difficult read...","I wanted to like this - it is my kind of story with the matrix-like theme and clever premise. But it just drags on and on and I don't find the author readable. Wish I did, there are plenty of sequels to fill my reading time, but it is not meant to be."
2,Too Slow!,"I had heard good things about Tad Williams going in, but mainly about his ""Dragonbone Chair"" books. I picked this one up with high expectations, and was utterly disappointed. The plot was very slow to develop, and never really got going. There was virtually no action or suspense in over 700 pages of text. It never held my attention for more than an hour or so, and it seemed like it would never end.The only positive I can give Williams is his concept of a virtual reality system was well thought out and realistic."
2,A total sleeper,"You know that book you keep hoping will get better but it never does. This is that book. NOTHING EVER HAPPENS!!! This book realistically should have been about 300 pages, not the over 700 it was. The story moves almost nowhere with so many unnecessary side stories by !Xabu that you just can't bring yourself to care about. I will not be finishing this series. Sorry Tad I hate to rip on anyone but this one leaves you with a bad taste."
5,I Remember It Well,It's a shame that at the time of this review this CD was very rare because it is a very strong compilation by Ronnie. Having owned the cassette not long after the Album was first issued I gotta say that I remember how much my entire family and I loved it and I am tempted to purchase an LP as a last resort. Ronnie Milsap was and still is an idol of mine and he is one of the best!..........Update: It is now almost 6 years later (8-8-2012) and I am still waiting for this Great CD to either go back in print or the CD's that are out there to come down to a respectable price. My LP I bought almost 6 years ago still looks & sounds Great!.....Hint! Hint!
5,Excellent add-on,"The kids like this new vehicle and challeges.Thinkfun must modify the base so this extra cars and cards fit all in the same space, now we have the game in one place ant the extra cars and cards somewhere else."
1,cardio work out,"The cardio work out cd was a disappointment. I thought it would be fast pace and really help with my workout on the eliptical machine, but I didn't find it to be fast enough I would not recommend this for a fast paced workout"
4,Definitely for beginners,"The book is well written and has great illustrations and especially good information on products for the beginner. It really shows how much fun textile surface design can be however I must stress that if you have done much work with surface design at all, this book will not be very challenging. It is a great book for beginners!."
2,worst version of tetris,i am a tetris guy. i Love the series and have almost every major version. this is by far the worst.
3,Good for the price,Phone has good sound. Range leaves a little to be desired. Light weight and easy to use. Great for apartment dwellers.
2,Bedford Guide,"The Bedford Guide for College Writers with Reader, Research Manual, and HandbookThe quality of the book was less than I expected. It was listed as gently used but iot is more like well used."
4,Blake's review,Bag is easy to carry and lightweight. It is good for carrying gym clothes to school. Bag is somewhat hard to open.
4,A nice addition to any saltwater aquarium hobbyists' library,"This book is packed with SPECTACULAR photos of fishes, corals and inverts found in Hawaiian waters. It includes a common name, scientific name, Hawaiian name (if applicable), and description with each photo. It is a good guide in helping to identify and learn more about these marine animals."
4,Plastic Bag,"The rethreading chasers themselves are very good quality and worked fine for me. Only four stars because it appeared that they would come in the red plastic storage case they were pictured with,they didn't, they came in a plastic bag."
5,Well written biography,"This is one of the best written biographies about American POWs I have ever read. This is the story of Everett Alvarez jr. He was the longest held American POW held in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Despite of having to go through isolation, starvation and other kind of torture, he made it."
2,For Collectors only,"Three Man Army were a brilliant English Power Rock Trio from the early 70s. However, this CD of unreleased tracks from the so called golden age of Rock , only issued in the last couple of years, is weak, very weak, especially when played alongside any of their other albums. The main reasons are the extremely cliche lyrics and the music lacks the intensity I was expecting in anticipation. I can honestly say that this album will only satisfy die-hard T.M.A. fans. If you are unfamiliar with the music of T.M.A. then start with Three Many Army TWO or failing that, A Third of a Lifetime. You won't be disappointed with either of those."
4,Fascinating and sinful,This book was quite entertaining. I enjoy the rich and detalied portrayal of deciet and heartless emotions. I would reccomend it to almost anyone. The movie is also very wonderful.
5,Sound of music.,"Great listening for relaxation. This music is stress relief at its finest. Very good sound! I love Kindle music, the simplicity of purchase."
5,the nazi officer's wife is excellent!,Possibly one of the best books I've ever read. It's interesting and educational at the same time. It was powerfully moving and sad and uplifting. I think I appreciated it even more because it was a true story. Edith Hahn allows you to feel empathy with someone in a set of life circumstances most of us could never understand--but she brings us closer to what it must have been like. A must-read.
4,The Nazi Officer's Wife,This is a pretty interesting book if you're into stuff about WWII. A & E made it into a movie which is out on video and I have it as well. Worth both reading and watching.
5,True Account of Survival,Edith was very brave and strong for the risks she took. During this book I would have to take a moment to calm myself down. The book is written in such a way that you get nervous for her and terrifed to turn the next page. Edith showed me what bravery is all about. She took a true risk telling her boyfriend who she actually was but smart because he loved her. He took advantage of her situation but it was a day to day fear that she would be found out about.
4,A Reminder that Civilization is Fragile,"Most reviews on Amazon.com critically examine the author's efforts to survive during the Nazi era by hiding her Jewish identity and marrying a German who would later become a Nazi officer. For me, this memoir was more a reminder that real, unvarnished, evil exists in the world. This young women from beautiful, sophisticated, cultured, Vienna, witnessed how quickly that veneer of civilization peeled back to reveal envy, selfishness, prejudice, and eventually complete barbarism under the opportunities (for some) and fear (for others) of the Nazi regime. Civilization untethered to a strong moral foundation is a very fragile thing. The sad irony is that less than 75 years later, so many have deluded themselves into thinking otherwise."
5,A memorable true story of survival,I read this book two years ago and consider it a very memorable true story of survival. The true stories of people's lives in Germany during the Holocaust should be remembered. My book club will discuss it next year so I needed my own copy.
4,Unique Story,"I thought I had exhausted the types of situations people found themselves in trying to survive the Holocaust. I was wrong.Edith Hahn has a unique tale to tell of suffering, courage, and downright luck, if one who loses so much yet survives, can be called lucky.There is a harrowing scene in this book where Ms Beer is searching for her mother in France, and is excoriated by concentration camp survivors for the choice she made to marry a Nazi.This is a heartfelt book that will haunt you."
5,As Promised,It was delivered so quickly!It was an excellent book!! So insightful! A whole different point of view.
2,"important story, poor delivery","I would give 2 and a half stars. This is a good read in that any account of human experiences is important to remind us of the evils in the world, and human resilience nevertheless. The writing, however, is too rudimentary, and one dimensional."
4,"A book with a good story, but slightly oversentimental","Parts of this story are very well written, while others are very vague. I enjoyed most of the stories in this book, but thought that sometimes she began to feel overly sorry for herself when she didn't even live through the concentration camps like most Jews in Europe. It made it hard for me to fully simpathize with a woman that married a Nazi officer when her own people were dying. However, I do think that this book is worth a read. I have read several Holocaust memoirs, and find them very interesting and inspirational. To me, it felt like Ms. Beer was more informal then necessary, asking questions to the reader periodically, but in some ways, this is an interesting approach to telling her story. It really all depends on your personal preference."
1,another evil person,"explains away her actions""I had to do it""just like gestapo camp guards burning babiesshe abandonded a girl back to an orphanage, now that she didnt need a playmate for her own daughter anymore.these people make me sick"
1,How boring can you get,"A shallow book, I did'nt find the story a bit inetresting especially the way the author wrote it, oversentimental and boring."
4,Amazing story,"I have read many books about the Holocaust - from personal accounts of concentration camp survivors to biographies of Gestapo officers (and everything in between)- I found this woman's story to be both educational and inspirational. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down."
5,THE BEST BOOK ON JEWISH STUDIES I HAVE EVER LISTEND TO OR READ!,"DO NOT MISS THIS WORK OF ART. I cried and cried as I listend to one woman's story about surviving during a time in history that should never be forgotton. I feel very emotional about this work...so if I don't get into detail about the story itself, please forgive me. I will say this, however. Every person that reads THE NAZI OFFICER'S WIFE"" will be touched forever.Steve Horwitz"
5,Could not put this book down!,"While this woman did not endure the hardship of one of the death camps she did endure the psychological, emotional and physical hardships of losing her family and being completely unsure of anything in her life. At any moment her identity could have been found out and she lived to tell the story. It's a fascinating yet very sad view of the entire era that she lived. I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in that time in history."
5,Fascinating book!,A very interesting book that kept my husband and I up later than we should have been many nights until we finished it.
1,The Technique of Motor Racing,"The condition was listed as used but in very good shape. I was extremely disappointed when the book arrived. The cover on the spine of the book had been sliced through by a box knife. While I could still read the book it was not what I would have considered as in ""very good condition""."
4,Foo Fighters I'll Stick Around,"This title contains five classic foo fighter songs, and would surely make any fan happy, it also has a great song from the original foo fighters cd, I'll stick around, this is a must have for all foo fighter fans, and any fans of alternative music."
5,This one was definitely a winner!,"Short novels are my thing....and this one did not disappoint! ""Born to be Wild"" was a perfect blend of love and heartache. Lauren and Max are two totally different people from different sides of the tracks. She's a high and mighty socialite......and he's a rough and tumble caterer who rides a Harley. And when they get together...look out. Add two foster kids to the picture and you've got one terrific mess. And it gets better with every page!"
4,Light Entertainment,"Nothing sensational or awe inspiring, but all in all a very pleasant read. It is a lighthearted romance that will put a smile on your face and give you an itch to ride a Harley."
1,chinese junk,"Some years ago, I replaced tuners on a guitar with Ping tuners, and they were absolutely great tuners, stayed in tune forever. I just recently purchased 3 sets of these Ping tuners, and they are absolutely worthless junk, with even nylon bushings. It is hard to believe that we have sunk to this all time low of importing junk .Amazon you should be ashamed of your self, and I won't be buying anything fromyou in the future."
2,Just as cheap as the ones I replaced,The quality of these tuners are as bad as the ones I wanted to replace. I'm very disappointed in the other reveiws that said these were good.
4,ok for a cheap guitar,"But I wouldnt use it on a nice fender. squier, sure. I got this just to put a new tuner on this cheapo strat copy I got from good ol craigslist for cheap. the tuners cost almost as much as the guitar, if that tells you the purpose."
4,cheap but great,This product though looks nice is obviously cheap. But despite it being cheap they are good for a quick fix. I am a beginner guitarist and was given a guitar with no strings tuning machines or bridge pins I needed a quick easy fix and saw these. They are definitely cheap but if your looking for a quick easy fix that will actually work quite well than I would advise these.
4,good game for family,"Cranium The Family Fun Game is an engaging, interactive family game and unlike many board games works well for for families with kids who have a significant age range. Because many of the challenges on the cards are just as hard for an adult as a child (drawing with your eyes closed, using flipper frogs to knock down stacks of Cranium cubes) the playing field is more level than in some games. Also, because you work in teams, it is easy to pair kids and parents up to help each other.The board and all the playing pieces are fun and colorful.Another family friendly feature is that the game runs between 30 minutes and an hour so is a good choice if you have limited time."
4,You need 4 or more players,"So far it's not been as fun for me using it as directions state. I got it to keep here at the house for when my only Granddaughter visits. We have never gotten to play since it requires four people. However, it's still fun getting out the cards and making up our own rules. It lost a star because the decription didn't mention the number of players required."
5,Love the Board Game,Bought this for my grandchildren. They love the game. It is nice to have a board game instead of a video or tv game.
3,Receycling the same Cranium activities,"The Family Fun game has the same, recycled Cranium game activities found in the other Cranium games. It's just a new box with a different name. If you want a truly fresh, unique and entertaning game try Rigamarole."
1,Cranium Family Edition,When this product arrived it wasn't the family edition that was advertised the Disney edition was sent instead.. Plus it had a Kohls.com price sticker on the bottom of $29.95 and the company charged us $89.00. I would never do business with this company again!
4,Great fun,Great family game. My daughter reaches for this game often for family game nites. Challenging yet fun. A must have.
1,Defective,Received walker as promised. Product was defective - right arm did not lock in place. Unsafe for my mother to use. Back it went.
1,Please tell me this is a joke...,"I love grindcore. I totally and utterly adore it. However this is not grindcore. This sounds like my baby sister screaming the house down because I stole her dummy. The drumming is good i'll give you that, but there's not rhythm or structure to any of the songs, and you can't even make out what the hell the lead singer is yelling about. Every song sounds exactly the same!I just can't see how anyone would like this. I'm sorry but I have to speak my mind this is total bull s**t and pretty much everyone knows it. I want these nuts shot or bombed or something. They seriously have not idea about making music. They probably listened to Napalm Death or Pig destroyer and thought...I can do that! Well here it is from someone who knows...you can't. Your crap! Plain and Simple.I pitty this band because they think they're grindcore. I'm a bass guitarist in a grindcore band so take the advice.Listen to Pig Destroyer or Agoraphobic Nosebleed."
1,william hung rocks,"I don't get it. I really don't. People actually think this is good music? These guys make MuDvAyNe and Slipknot sound like classics. I'm sorry, but the guitarist knows like 2 chords (maybe) and the vocals sound like my cousin' three-year-old daughter having a temper tantrum. Not to mention, the titles are so rediculously wannabe offensive they are actually hillarious. Don't even get me started on the band name. Did they actually think they would get radio play with a name like that? I admit I listened to it because of the song titles, just out of curiousity. I at first thought something was wrong with my real player and it was playing the same song. NOPE! Want hard rock or metal? Listen to classics, like Sabbath, Metallica, Zeppelin, or even new stuff like Disturbed, heck, even Slayer! This goes to the dogs!"
1,I can describe this band in a couple of catagories...,"Vocals: GAAAAAAAAHHHWAGAGOGAAAAAAAGAWAGAAAHHH!!!DAAAAABADASOSADABABA!!! That's how the vocals sound like. Hope you enjoy this album...Lyrics: Fu**ing hilarious, in a bad way! The lyrics consist of, ""This is gay! You suck! You own a store! You're a c***!"" Stupidity at its finist!Guitar: The guitarist just strums random chords and luckily he doesn't solo.Bass: No bass heard at all.Drums: The drummer just beats the sh** out of the drums and has no sense of rhythem at all!Conclusion: THIS BAND SUCKS!!!"
1,This is not music my friends...,Okay i know talent when i see or hear it in this case and ac has no talent at all. I bet you 12 year olds can play better then ac can--not to mention all they do is scream and its so pointless. Im some one who listings to some grind and a lil deathmetal and metalcore so i know brutal music when i hear it but i cant realy say that about ac because they don't play music...They play noise and it truly sucks! If you guys want a band to mock on then ac is your pick other wise stick with good extreme and brutal music...Not trash okay?!Skip this piece of sh*t.
1,I wold like it to see A.C. die.,That's right. A.c. will burn in hell. You can't hear anything these retarded ass holes they are screaming. So I would like it if A.c. wikll die.
1,"Um, okay...","Hmm, this is...odd. The song titles are really funny (You Own a Store, heh), and I say song titles cuz I'm not sure if there are actually lyrics. But really, what is this? It kinda sounds like grindcore, but like, not. The musicians just bang loudly at their instruments while some guy makes this weird shrieking noise. I may not be far from there already, but I don't think I could listen to this long before going completely crazy. If you want some real extreme metal, I recommend some Cannibal Corpse, but this is really just for comic relief."
1,Shock music is g-a-y.,"All right, we know this is shocker music. We know it's *supposed* to be funny. But can we really let these people off the hook with those explanations?I mean, think about it: if you were a bigot and you wanted a way to say politically incorrect things without being hanged from the seat of your pants, which avenue would you take? Comedy of course. How can we tell the difference between people who are saying mean, hateful things for the purpose of ""shock"" or comedy, and those who really mean it? We can't. That's what makes A-n-a-l C-u-n-t so disturbing to me. And I feel they shouldn't be defended; because of the fact they could very well mean it. I don't know them personally, so I don't know one way or the other. I just know that to even fix your mouth to say certain things is a sign of something wrong despite its intent to be funny. And that's all we have to go on: their music."
3,Don't like it? Maybe you don't get the joke.,"Well, if someone gets annoyed with A.C., well, A.C. wins. That's the whole point of their ""music"": to p*ss people off.Now, let's get some facts straight:To ""Dr. Dogbreath Alex"": since when listening to Sabbath and Slayer makes you poser? These are the foundations of extreme metal as we know it!Since when someone playing a particular music style can only listen to that style? Even in the old days, the guys from Napalm Death listened loads of ""non-metal"" music, like Discharge (Punk/Hardcore), The Swans (Noise Rock), Coil (Industrial) and Led Zeppelin (Classic Rock). And nobody ever called them ""posers"" back them...To the reviewer ""Shkandrij"": get your facts straight. ""They probably listened to Napalm Death or Pig destroyer and thought...I can do that""! Pig Destroyer's full length debut came out in 1998; A.C. released theirs in 1992. So, what you claimed is impossible, because A.C. came first."
1,"Oh, where to start...","Don't buy this.. make your OWN A.C. album! It's simple, kids:1. Throw a bunch of toasters into a woodchipper and jumbo jet engine during a sandstorm.2. Gag-vomit the whole time. Record everything with a 3rd-world microphone made of coconuts.Every song sounds exactly the same, so who cares if there are 50? The song titles only attempt to offend you constantly. Surprisingly, the reviewers who gave this trash 5 stars write so skillfully. The target audience for this is that mangy black-bearded guy with candy trapped in the hair covering his eyes, more tattoos than a coloring book, billions of piercings and grunting who stood too close to you at the bus station. This is the worst, ear-bleeding sound ever. Farting is more musically fulfilling.Why pay for torure? Just stay far, far away."
1,worst band ever,This band is so bad that I stuck sporks in my ears to numb the pain. You can't really even hear the singer! Anybody who likes this band takes it up the butt with feet.
1,What the F...,"The only sound I hear coming out of my speakers is similar to that of a cat being tortured with a stun gun as some bad imitation of a hardcore metal group plays in the background. I would rather stab myself in the face with an ice pick than listen to this album.And what's so funny about this band when you can't even understand the lyrics? Apart from the occasional [bad word] the only thing I decipher is the incessant screeching of a seriously impaired human being.In sum, friends don't let friends listen to [this.]Many of their songs are about rape, being raped, or laughing about someone being raped, but personally, I think this album could actually be a soundtrack for gang rape."
5,Noise Rock At It's Finest!!!,"The best thing A.C. have released! Hands down! People have to learn not to be offended by things like this, especially things not directed at them. I always laugh at this CD, but just because it's so bad and ridiculous. If this album is for you, just enjoy it!"
5,"I am Swiss and I think this is a great book for a good laugh, XENO","This is a short simple to read book about the Swiss. I am Swiss, born there, but did not grow up in this very clean state. My wife who is a U.S. citizen bought me the book for my birthday. Because of my rowing career we traveled to Switzerland a fair bit and I observed the Swiss way through the eyes of my wife. I think this book is great for Swiss who live abroad because it reminds them why they miss Switzerland and why they don't. This book is great for Swiss who live in Switzerland and need motivation to go see other corners of the world. Since we have friends of different nationalities, Swede, Dutch, and German, we offered them their respective Xenophobe's Guide. They all loved their new booklet.Happy reading, XENO www gorow com"
2,Excessive cost for little information,"I purchased this book seeking insight regarding life trends/interest of the Swiss. In return I received a very small booklet with little useful information. The prices for this booklet is outrageous. Stop by Barnes and Noble, grab a cup to Joe and by the time your cup is empty you would have read this complete booklet. You would of had a few laughs but nothing worth taking home or even buying for others. Save your monies and look deeper for a book with more substance."
5,A book the whole family can read.,"This book is an expansion of a short story of the same name. As a short story, millions of readers have read it since it was a classic. I've discovered a powerful hard hitting novel by the same author. I am waiting for it to be published."
1,too small for too big of price.,"I am very disppointed with this sink mat. It is far too small for the price they charged. I seen bigger better made mats at the dollar store, wish I would have gotten one from there instead. I thought it would be better quality being its rubbermaid, I was wrong. If I send it back it will cost almost the same amount in shipping so I'm stuck with it."
3,Lifetime Keypad Warranty?,"Be careful when buying these phones. The OEM keypad has an average life of 6-18 months at a business and 2-3 years at a home. Panasonic has not re-designed the keypad and new or refurbished phones will have the same problem, even with a new keypad! You should not just accept a lifetime warranty from a company without researching their claims.Save yourself some trouble and do a search for ""Panasonic KX-TGA400b & KX-TGA200b Keypad Warranty""Copy and paste the test including the ("") quotations ("")"
3,Not heard much...,"Earache records re-released this EP with a couple of bonus tracks that are a real treat to the insane Clutch fan. One, older, unreleased song plus a demo cut from the early days of Clutch really let you in on the roots. Way back when, Neil Fallon's voice needed heavy processing to come across as punk and the riffs were simpler and heavier... Deep, excellent lyrics. I'm only giving this one 3 stars because it's basically a marketing ploy. The original (Passive Restrains) would definetly get 5 stars from me. Still, a real must for HUGE fans. Bring the heaviness home! P.S. If you're not convinced, fish out a copy of Passive Restraints at your local music store and read the lyrics. (All three songs are printed on the back.)"
2,"Fair, at best","The quality of this DVD is poor, it's like a home-made low budget production. Luckily my kids have done it a couple times (which is why I gave it 2 stars not 1) but I am definitely on the hunt again for a decent kids exercise DVD. To sum it up; it would be perfect if you found it in the dollar bin at Wal-Mart, but for the price I paid it's a complete dissapointment."
3,It's kind of boring.,"I did not watch the whole thing but I did watch about half so maybe the second half was better but I doubt it. I knew it was an exercise video for kids but I thought it would be more fun. They have strectches and go over different skills like: run, jump, skip. I think it would have been better if there were at least some fun music."
5,She loves it!,My Granddaughter is 2 years old (she'll be 3 years old in just a few months) and she absolutely loves this dvd! She wants to do it over and over. There are a couple of things that she can't do yet - but for the most part she is able to do everything on the dvd. We usually do it together when she is at my house but when she is at home with her parents - she does it by herself. She loves it! Definitely worth the money.
3,Better for the younger ones,It was a little slow moving. Did not quite keep the attention of my daughter. Might be fun for 2-3 year olds. I think it is a little too young for 5-6 year olds.
4,Loved it,"As a dance professional, I loved this tape, and so did my two year old niece. It is a great way to encourage exercise early on in a child's life."
3,Good to get moving inside,"This video is okay. My kids (3 and 23 mos.) like it, but don't love it. It is a good way to get them moving inside."
1,Boring,"I was looking for an exercise video for my daycare group, ages 2-5. They really like dance, exercise and music videos. This one did not hold the attention of any of the age groups. I am sorry to say I would keep looking if considering this video.Even the kids in the video seem bored with the activities."
4,A terrific late-nineties bay area comp,"A terrific late-nineties bay area comp featuring mostly exclusive tracks. I certainly recommend this along with 2 other Swerve Compilations released around the same time:Spread Yo HustleandCream.Here is a more detailed track listing:1. RBL Posse / Contact2.

5,Very good!,"I took a one-month Boot Camp for Women. We used Kettlebells quite a bit and I really liked using them. When the month was over, I decided to continue on my own at home. I bought Kettlebells from Amazon and this DVD. There are less expensive DVD's but I couldn't be more pleased with this one. I think Lauren is a wonderful coach. She reminds us how to breath and she's comfortable to listen to. I can't handle a 'Cheerleader-type' DVD instructor! Others have reviewed the format of the DVD, so I won't repeat that. I am 55 years old and have never enjoyed working out until being introduced to Kettlebells. I started out 40 pounds overweight, and have lost 20 so far through working out and eating quite healthy. I use Lauren and Kettlebells every-other day and do something else, like walking or another work-out DVD, on the in-between days. I think the best part is how fast the Kettlebell work-out gets the heart rate up. A 12 minute work-out probably equals a half hour of other exercises!"
4,New to Kettlebells,"Someone from a local Kettlebell Gym recommended this DVD to me because I found their one hour Kettlebell Gym classes to be too demanding for my age and fitness level, or lack thereof. So far, I really like this DVD. Lauren does a great job of explaining all the moves and offering a quick workout as well as a more extensive workout. I also appreciate that she has a very ""no nonsense"" approach, meaning you don't have to listen to all kinds of silly motivational gibberish. She just tells you what to do, how to do it and for how long.My only criticism, and it's small, is that I would have liked the 30 second rests, between sets, to be shorter."
2,Very disappointing,"Because of one glowing rating in particular, and because I thought the DVD expense surely reflected a superior product, I expected something amazing! I was very disappointed. I understand interval training, but the pattern of 2 minutes at medium intensity, followed by 1 full minute of recovery, for the entire routine, feels like a very inadequate workout. Had I rated only the trainer, I would have given it 3 stars. This DVD isn't nearly as good as another trainer's that I bought on sale at Target for 1/4 the price... I'm irritated at myself for spending my money on this!"
1,DVD doesn't work,"Was really excited for this and felt it was quite an investment compared to other DVDs. However when I received it I saw that it was weirdly black on many parts of the DVD ring. After putting into into my computer it doesn't even recognize that there is a DVD in there and you can hear it crunching. Sucks because I'm abroad for the rest of the year and shipping it back would be more expensive than buying a new one. Never had this problem before. What gives, Amazon?"
1,not challenging at all.,"This is not a good workout if you have been working out regularly for years. This is very simple, slow and it will not challenge you at all. This should be rated easy and would be very good for new exercisers only."
4,Underestimated this Video,I underestimated this video because i did the first 12 min video with a 18lb weight and i barely broke a sweat so i thought the 40 min video would be a breeze. Mind you i do insanity and Jillian Micheal's DVDs so after the first minute of the 40 min video i thought i could be bad azz and adjust my kettle bell to 20lbs! how WRONG i was... lol. I had to go right back to 18lbs because this video is a bit difficult if you have a heavy kettle bell. And 40 min swinging a heavy weight is a LONG time i couldn't get through the whole thing which made me rethink this whole work out. All in all its a good workout and the only reason im giving it 4 stars is because i think after each exercise a 60 second break is unnecessary you kinda got to fast forward the video to make it consistent which can be annoying. Another thing is the price. Its pretty pricey but i guess your paying for a Certified Kettle bell instructor. But a good workout overall!
5,Great workout,"This is a great workout for excercisers of all levels. My body has become stronger and more toned, and I've only been doing her workout 4 times/week for 4 weeks. Lauren Brooks is a great instructor and breaks down the workouts easily so that you can acheive proper form. To those of you who think that this workout is too easy, you obviously weren't using a heavy enough kettlebell.This is an awesome workout for everybody!"
4,Ultimate Body Scupt & Conditioning w/ Kettlebells,Excellent but choppy. She carefully goes through about 12 kettlebell movements. Not particularly great video but she demonstrates well. There are several training loops but some were overwhelming for my level of exercise.
5,This has it all,Lauren Brooks knows her stuff and presents it well. By sharing her story about her pregnancy and having a 50 plus training partner she shows us all that it's never too late to get in great shape. The ancedotes/factoids shown as subtitles during rest periods give additional inspiration and background.
5,I get it !,"I have been ""lurking"" enough through the reviews and felt it fair to finally post my opinion. I really enjoy this DVD. It is a SERIOUS workout ! I think it is important to approach it like a one on one training session with a personal trainer. No, there is no fancy choreography, or glitzy set. The rest breaks that many have concerns about are really a lot like when your trainer has you take rest breaks between sets. If you give 100 % during the sets, you will NEED that break. I do not feel as if I have to pace myself, so I go ALL out during the sets ( I mean, toungue hanging, panting, grunting ALL out) because I know that rest is coming. I am usually a little sore the next day, all over, but I am functional and I know that muscle is building. I will definitely buy the other DVD's in her collection."
5,Love it!,Great workout. Was looking for interval cardio I could do that wasn't high impact as I have a foot problem. This is perfect and is a GREAT cardio workout!
3,Sydney White and the Seven Dorks,"Sydney White (Bynes) didn't grow up like your typical girl. After her Mom died, her plumber father raised her. She's a strong, tough girl and she needs all of that to survive SAU. When she arrives at college on a scholarship, she pledges as a legacy to her Mom's sorority, Kappa Phi Nu. Unfortunately, the President hates her on sight for taking her ex-boyfriend and the war is on.The story's predictable and we have a very commercial spin on the 'poisoned Apple' but it's an amusing way to spend an hour and a half. And the dork in me definitely cheered her on."
5,Lots of Laughs,"Much like any Amanda Bynes movie, don't go in expecting any Oscar-worthy performances. But what I love about her is that she ALWAYS makes me laugh, and it is pretty hard not to like her in anything she's in.Sydney White is no exception...the updated take on the classic Snow White is very cute and charming. The title character is a sweet and unassuming tomboy going off to college with plans to pledge her late mother's sorority. But upon encountering the ""evil"" Rachel WITCHburn, falling for the charming Tyler PRINCE, and meeting seven fabulous dorks (not to be confused with dwarfs. :-) ), she begins to wonder if sorority life is all it's cracked up to be. Along the way, there are some hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments, especially when the seven dorks are involved.So, although a bit cheesy, if you're looking for something light and funny, this is the perfect movie! Enjoy!"
1,was not happy,"I ordered a Full Screen Edition, the case states that it is full screen the packaging states it is full screen but the disc inside is Wide Screen, needless to say I am very disappointed and hot happy with this purchase. Now that it is open I cannot return it. :("
1,Stupid Search Button,Amazon's stupid search button came up with this movie claiming it was 'She's the Man'. It is not that movie yet the search said it was. I want my money back.
1,"If you are over 14 and not a female, stay far away","I was forced to watch this movie, and was surprised to see people raving about how funny it is. In a room full of people, not a single chuckle was heard as this movie played. I have seen people have more fun at funerals.The movie goes into the whole ""Mean Girls"" territory, a subject really needing no more exploration, with nothing clever to add. It had something of the Snow White twist on it, but that really made it no more interesting and became a one-trick pony quickly. If you are an obsessed fan of Snow White, you may get a little more out of it. For the rest of us, you know how it's all going to play out from the first few minutes and it just drags on. There's no energy, nothing clever.Whether or not you are an Amanda Bynes fan, the script is so bland, not much can save it. If you are a 12 to 14 year old female, you may be the target audience and really enjoy it, but otherwise few will see this whole movie all the way through."
1,How bad can a movie be.....,Bynes is a lousy performer. She has no talent and has no taste in starring in drek like this.
4,Loved It!!,"So, this isn't the movie that will change the world, but I rank it with Ever After as a fun fairy tale. Amanda Bynes is great, but for us Buffy fans it is Danny Strong who steals the show as ""Grumpy"" Gurkin. He had the best lines, and I just love him.My suggestion...watch this movie for what it is, a fun fairy tale. expect nothing more :-)"
5,Sydney White Movie,"I got my copy of Sydney White in the mail within a few days of ordering it online. I was very impressed with how quickly it got here. The outer cover looked great...not scratches or marks. My roommate and I watched the movie the day we got it, and it didn't skip or anything. It was perfect quality!!"
2,LOOKED OLD AND UGLY AFTER 3 months,"I made a mistake when I purchased this particular pillow. Within a few months of light use the material had pills, matted areas, and bald spots. I fell for the fancy description using words like ""Rosette"" and Knife Edge"". I think I'd have found a nicer pillow at Target or Walmart."
1,does not look like the picture,"When you view the closeup picture of this pillow, you see the fabric looks like it is made up of dozens of little ""curls"", almost like poodle fur.When the pillows arrived, the fabric have NO such curls, just large blocks of textured fabric. Why do sellers mislead us like this???"
2,cheap look and feel to them,These pillows are really soft but the material is really shiny and it looks really cheap. The inside filling feels really cheap too. I wasn't suprised because of the price but I took my chances based on the 2 reviews.
2,Waste!,"This is like three inches tall, I guess I didnt realize how SMALL three inches was until I bought this. The sand gets stuck all the time, but that might have to do with the intense humidity of the south Pacific. All in all, it serves it purpose, but I wish I had measured out what it would look like, it TOO SMALL for a classroom setting."
4,Great sand timer!,"It's perfect to hold in the hand, and the sand looks so fine that it looks like fluid flowing in the glass.But, it came with a scratch in the glasss :("
3,Not three minutes,"This timer's accuracy is suspect: mine seems to measure around 2 minutes 45 seconds. Mine has also clogged a couple of times - since it's fresh out of the box, I'm hoping that this was due to the sand sitting for a while, and will clear up with use - we'll see.Aesthetically, it's very nice - much better than the plastic ones that are included with some party games.The exact length of time isn't important to me - I'm using it to enforce the GTD two-minute-rule, which I'm already breaking by using a three-minute timer. If you're looking for better precision, however, you should look elsewhere."
1,Overrated,"If you bought this album, you should do the following:1) Get off of welfare2) Stop having babies3) Lay off of the booze4) Stop filling up our jails5) Stop polluting our cities with your crime-ridden ways6) Get a real job7) Pick up a book and read (comics and magazines don't count)8) Try to speak proper English"
1,gangster rap is dead,There is nothing gangster about this album except for the album cover. Bow Down is by far the best of the two. Weak hooks with weak beats... You can tell Ice Cube didn't have much to do with this one and WC is the only sold rapper in the group. The only reason I gave it a star is because there is one good song on the CD and thats it. What happened to the true gangster rappers... Cube you might want think about doing a NWA reunion.
5,Here we go!,"Here it comes, Tha Westside connection! Great album, just as good as their first release. I am very pleased and recommend this cd to everyone that bumps that WestCoast Hip Hop!"
2,not whut i expected,"their debut album ""Bow Down"" is a straight up banger.now the west has been quiet for awhile, it's time for these 3 rappers to step up.I listened to dis album while i was walking around the mall, the first four songs are good. but the rest made me turn off my cd player. it's disappointing.W.C. should've spit the way he did before. but he's not hungry nemore.don't buy dis album. just listen to ""Bow Down"""
2,Westside Connection is sucks.Ice,Westside Connection is sucks.Ice Cube was good back in his day. He sucks in This one. there not even one good song in it. There is one say let get retarded? no thank you .its get 2 out of 5.
5,WC is back with a bang,"In a time where rappers are falling in love and recording duets for the pop appeal, Ice Cube, WC, and Mack 10 are back to restore the rap game to its hardcore thug status. In the new Westside Connection album, ""Terrorist Threats"", it is apparent that the Connect' gang is on a mission. The beats are tight and the rap pioneers deliver each lyric with power and that infamous west coast swagger. In the track entitled ""Pimp the System"", W.S.C rejects the common theme of today's rap songs and says pimping is not just about the ""hos"" but it is about getting money any way you can and pimping the system. Westside Connection also disses the aforementioned pop rappers in the track, ""So Many Rappers In Love"". This album brings the toughness back into rap music that it is desperately lacking, and no matter if you live on the west, east, south, or wherever...true rap fans will appreciate this cd."
4,Good Overall.. plenty of good songs,"WC didn't disappoint. The majority of songs are hot: izm, bangin at the party, call 911, pimp the system, superstar, get ignit. The others are pretty good, too. Definitely worth the money."
4,kick ass,"I bought this cd last month and i was amazed how good it was i like most of the tracks on thisThe best tracks are terrorist threats,potential victims,gangsta nation,pimp the system but the whole cds good"
4,WESTSIDE CONNECT GANG BACK IN THE HOUSE,"ICE CUBE, MACK 10, AND W.C. RETURN WITH THIS ALBUM. JUST FROM HEARING ''SO MANY RAPPERS IN LOVE'', I ALREADY KNOW THAT THESE GUYS AIN'T GONNA GO COMMERCIAL FOR ANYONE. THE TRIO PROVES THAT THEY ARE STILL IN FACT, ONE OF THE DOPEST RAP GROUPS IN THE GAME. SONGS LIKE ''GET OUTTA POCKET'', ''POTENTIAL VICTIMS'', AND ''GANGSTA NATION'' PROVE JUST HOW REAL THEY ARE. THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD TO BLAST DOWN THE ROAD IN A CAR. THIS ALBUM IS AN INSTANT MUST-HAVE. ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS FROM 2003."
4,How did this get any low reviews?,"How the hell this CD got any bad reviews is beyond me... I swear, people need to scrape the crap out of their ears.. this CD is one of the most bangin released in the past 2-3 years, and I might even be so ballsy as to say this one is BETTER than Bow Down. All these haters never cease to amaze me with their horrible reviews.. giving 1 star to incredible CD's.. get this one yourself and then make up your mind, cuz the cats who write these reviews don't know what they're talking about half the time. This is a TIGHT cd."
5,Cubes comeback n what rap needs today,"After the peace disc i thought there goes cube hes gone now and only a few good rappers remain after that there was 9-11 and many other good rappers threw out there careers like fabolous, dmx, jay z, and snoop dogg. When i heard ice cubes lyrics on lights out from mack 10s album i was amazed they were really good then i heard about terrorist threats comin out soon and bought it right away. cube makes a great comeback on this album and is helpin to change rap along w/ Wc, mack 10, dblock, dr dre and nas.The best song is so many rappers in love a hilarious dis at ja rule and all those other soft thugs. The lyrics are great on this album fo all 3 rappers and mack 10 is better than ever. Buy this album and buy these upcoming albums by: dr dre, jin, j hood, dblock, and jadakiss all in 04 it should be a great year to bring back gangsta rap."
4,The Best From The West in 2003,"This album is great!! Ice Cube, WC and Mack 10 sound perfectly togheter. The beats are greats, there are no r&b; hooks except for Nate Dogg's ""Gangsta Nation"". Westside Connection is on a mission on this album: BRING GANGSTA RAP BACK ON TOP. And they do it with songs like ""Potenial Victims"", ""So Many Rappers In Love"" (against the fake thugs RnB rappers) and ""Superstar"" (talkin' about people, like 50 Cent, who become famous just because they got shot).Westside"
4,bangin,"No doubt WC is coming hard on this one. That flow that's been missing every since Bow Down is finally back. But to reply to an earlier review, I agree about the commercial rappers. But Lil Jon don't belong on that list, Lil Jon has repped the south hard since about 95 with no airplay and no respect outside ATL and Alabama. Who Ya Wit and Freak a lil something we're club bangers way before the radio caught up and made Jon & ESB household. But no doubt WSC is back on track. Cali is back woo bangin again, e-40 and now Westside Connec, it's on again!"
3,Not heavy duty...,"It will certainly keep you dry, but putting gromets in the corners of this poncho is kind of a bad joke...way too lightweight to string up. The older style military ponchos were heavier duty and could take the abuse, not here. However, if you are looking for a very lightweight poncho for backpacking use it would work out fine. I think that the hood is too small and tight on my head...yes i have a big head, but it's still a problem. I chose to push it back and use a boonie instead. It's ok is about the best i could say."
2,Not as expected,Not as expected and is not the same as a real issued GI poncho. This picture looks different then what I got.
1,Don't be fooled!,Don't let the GI in the title fool you. This is not a Mil Spec poncho & is a cheap chinese knock off. Would not rely on this item to keep me sheltered or dry.
1,Too small hood,Do you want to know why on the picture that guy did not put on the hood. It is because he cannot. The poncho body is design for an adult but the hood is for an infant.
4,Nice HD poncho,"Good construction, loose sizing. Granted, branded as GI means you get camo only, I would like to see more color options. As someone in the Pac NW we get a lot of rain when camping and use these regularly - the standard wispy poncho's won't cut it. This one should stand up to several years of use."
3,Poncho...,The poncho itself wasn't the best - it leaked the first time I wore it in the rain. Customer service though was great. They were professional and a joy to work with (they refunded me my money).
5,13 year old girl's opinion,"Hey! I'm 13. I was first introduced to webkinz this July while I was on vacation. Before then I had no idea what a webkin was. I bought two the collie and the bunny! When I got home I went on the website. It's amazing! There are so many games, you can decorate your own house, feed your pets, win money, play trivia! Everything you can think of! I love webkinz! I'm one of the biggest fans i have 99 now btw. If your stuck on a gift to buy anyone... even though they are stuffed animals... buy a webkin today!"
1,Complete Book of Snide Remarks,"Leonard Ashley has compiled a modestly informed, error-filled book with far more interest in his inflated ego than any true scholarship. The glaring errors are not nit-picking either...he boasts of his own prowess as a scholar, then makes major mistakes when referring to some of the most classic werewolf films ever made - including Universal's ""The Wolf Man"". The volume does succeed in bringing together a fairly wide array of entertaining werewolf & shape-shifter lore, but with all of the really good books on the history of lycanthropy that have been published over the years, there's no reason to subject yourself to Ashley's condescending remarks and insults directed at his readers. Mr. Ashley clearly feels that werewolves (and fans of werewolves as well) are beneath him - but I get the impression that he must have been under contract to write the book anyway.People looking for a great resource on werewolf legends should pick up Brad Steiger's ""The Werewolf Book""."
1,The author needs to do his homework.,"This book is not only incomplete, but filled with mistakes and should not rightly be called a ""complete book"". Funny how the author claims to be a expert on the subject of werewolves yetgets all of the Howling movies titles mixed up. He also includes references to movies that may or may not be related. For example, he references the movie ""Vampire Hunter D"", a movie which he has never seen: ""It's claimed there is werewolfery in it somewhere. I don't know."" THEN WHY PUT IT IN A BOOK ABOUT WEREWOLVES?Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,Elmer Fudd,The hat was delivered quickly and is what it claims to be. The only issue I have with it is that I look an awful lot like Elmer Fudd when I wear it.Robert M.
3,So So...,The hat is really made for somebody with an extra large head. Maybe the manufacturer was responding to other complaints that it was too small and they went overboard. It is cheaply made but it will serve the intended purpose I suppose.
3,Blocks Sun...,"The construction is good and it will keep the sun off your neck. I gave it three starts because the size adjustment is a draw string in the back that both sits on the back of your head and gets bigger as you reduce the size of the head band. For me, a guy with a fairly big head, it was still a noticeable problem so if you have to draw it down much you're going to have a big knot of material poking you and the base on your head. Any movement or wind also had the side flaps flowing out so much that it was reducing the ability for the flap to provide sun coverage to my ears. If you're looking down or bent over doing whatever you're doing in no wind, you should be good to go but any wind, walking, etc. (and you're going to be getting a combination of those) will result in reduced effectiveness. It's ok, I guess but I would not buy it again."
2,Space opera Las Vegas style,"I love SF and just read the whole series over the course of a week. To sum up:Harmless, unimaginative, going-through-the-motions pulp fiction, which happens to be located in a space future.A recap of the semi-fascistic voice in the stories of Heinlein wrapped around a B-rated classic western story, only with the gender roles swapped and with the Naxids in the role of unusually lame indians.This is exactly the kind of SF that Paul Verhooven ridiculed in the movie ""Starship Troopers"".To me Walter Jon Williams has established himself as the Barbara Cartland of Science Fiction.Contemporary british SF writer Peter F. Hamilton does this infinitely much better, and there simply is no comparison to the grandaddy of all space opera, Asimovs Foundation-series (written around 1950)."
2,"""Voice of the Whirlwind"" was long time ago.","I was surprised that this new novel was by the same author who wrote ""Voice of the Whirlwind"". ""Conventions of War"" is pure bloatware. The main characters are likable so their individual stories are somewhat engrossing but many of the plot elements could have been dispensed with. The entire tale was very predictable with nameless hordes of people been bloodily dispensed with to provide some well needed excitement. I realise this novel is intended to be different in tone from some of Mr. William's previous work but I expected the same level of competence and flair in the story itself...to be frank this was a boring read."
2,Arrived in a trash bag,"The shoes arrived in what looked like a trash bag with some postal information on it, not a box. Normally I don't judge based on the packaging, but in this case it was somewhat fitting.The shoes themselves seemed to be of halfway decent quality for as cheep as they where. When I put them on, I noticed that one was incredibly loose. So loose it felt like it was going to fall off after a couple of steps. The elastic section was almost twice the size as the other, preventing the shoe from fitting snugly. I tried several ways of tightening the shoe enough to match the other one without any success.These could possibly be worth the money if they didn't have what I am going to assume is quality control issues. I, however, don't think I will ever purchase shoes online again."
2,run big,I've never had a problem ordering my husband shoes. These shoes run a full size too big. I got too busy and haven't returned them. There is no way he can wear them this big. The only thing is if they were sized wrong.
1,You get what you pay for,"I have owned these mocs for about 6 weeks and worn them mostly just on the weekends. The have already completely fallen apart and this is what I consider light use for a short time, heaven forbid if you wanted to wear them everyday. Waste of money and will be returing them for a refund. Size does run very large as well although this was a minor concern compared to construction."
2,Second Hand Clothing,"It sounds the same as all the rest of his albums... He's trying to get away with attempting to copy the simplistic genius sound of artists like Cat Stevens, who use simple, usually major chords, and repeat quite a bit, but eLi can't pull it off. If you're thinking about buying this CD, save your money and buy a Cat Stevens album. Only one of the songs has decent lyrics. eLi either needs to find originality and his own style, or give it up already.There's a reason you can get this album for $0.25."
1,Heckel & Jeckel Cartoon Classics,Was VERY disappointed in this video. My husband loved Heckel and Jeckel growing up and I've been scouring the internet for their videos. This one had ONE Heckel and Jeckel cartoon on the whole video.
3,For nastolgic fans only,"This is the last of the dying breed of collisium home video releases. Its basically a compilation of matches that you'd find on WWf Prime Time back in that period. Not that its all bad but its not for the newer fans. Hosted by Sean Mooney who wanders around the USS intrepid (how does this have anything to do with wrestling?) The types of matches are HBK vs The Bulldog, Hogan/Piper vs Sid/Flair, a 8 man tag that is forgettable, The Mountie (who lip syncs his intro..sad)/Nasties vs Hitman/Disasters and on and on. Undertaker comedy skit with a tailer, and if it couldn't get any worse The Bushwackers do aerobics. But its a video for people who remember Prime Time complete with the Sean Mooney and Alfred Hayes doing what has to be the worst comentary I've ever heard. ugh he augh, got him in ugh, well he ugh...augh shut up Alfred!!! 2 hours. great for sleeping pill."
5,Fantastic,"Authentic and delicious, this entire line of spices is fantastic. A very good value, prompt handling by the vendor, highly recommended."
2,Hot Paprika Tin Review,"I cannot recommend this Hot Paprika Tin. It's not HOT and has very little flavor. Only things I can think that it might be used for is to color soup red. After using it 3 times, I threw it in the trash."
3,Is Odin a God or not.,"The book is rather good.The author goes into detail about the lives of the Saxons, Norse and Celts who lived on the Island of England at various periods.I most say say I learned a great deal about them from this book.The only thing that really got to me was the authors treatment of the Gods. He could never make up his mind weather they were mearly humans that became reveared as gods (very unlikely).Or if they were truly Gods it really gets annoying seeing Professor Bates flip back and forth once on the same page if memory serves me correctly.However the history alone makes this book worth it."
3,"Long on mysticism, short on Tolkien","I agree with a previous reviewer that this book is not really about Tolkien's Middle-earth. You can read for pages and pages without a single reference to hobbits or dwarves! The author is a good writer, and the history is interesting, though I got the feeling that it was a somewhat oversimplified picture of Anglo-Saxon England. Also, there was a tendency for the author to belabor a point with lots of vague sentences that sound more meaningful than they really are. Here's an example of one of the worst offenders: ""In Middle-earth, the interlocking threads which manifest the hidden forces of the universe were woven into patterns of destiny for our individual lives"" (p. 184). I did learn some interesting tidbits, but anyone who expects this book to be more than remotely about Tolkien will be disappointed."
2,Not about Tolkien,"The title and blurbs are misleading: it isn't about Tolkien at all. It's an attempt by an English redbrick university psychology professor to use Tolkien's popularity as an awkward kicking-off point for a rather woo-woo account of the civilization and worldview of late first-millennium Celtic and Germanic Europe. His constant reference to these peoples as ""the real Middle-earth"" grates, and correlations with Tolkien's creation are only cursory."
5,vital radiance,This product is wonderful and I was so upset when it was discontined. I ordered it from your website and it arrived within 3 days. Fantastic!!!
5,Great primer!!,"I love this primer. It goes on so silky, and I use it instead of foundation in the summertime. Well worth the money!!"
3,waterpic flosser,Water left before flosser stops working. Pressure is very weak. I dont like this model. I would not recomend this model to others
4,Buy it,"This is a very good album. If you like maximo park, the futureheads, and bands like that, then you will not be disappointed with this album."
2,Offensively mediocre,"Given all the scratchy punk-pop acts pretending it's 1978 and pogo'ing around the UK nowadays, there is no reason to patronize *this* second-rate muck. Lousy, affected vocals, and not a decent melody on the whole disc (the darting guitars carry most of the harmonic content, while singer Orlando Weeks just yelps within a four-note range). Try ""Mary,"" if you must pick a track. Sure, the music has energy and is produced with the right degree of boozy grit, but these are the only selling points. Look upthe first Futureheads albuminstead. Or the Arctic Monkeys. Or Maximo Park. Or Art Brut. Or Dogs Die in Hot Cars. Or even Hot Hot Heat, if you don't mind a little music from the other side of the pond. Just don't look...here."
4,NICE SHOES,"ALTHOUGH THEY WERE A BIT MORE THAN I USUALLY SPEND, I WENT AHEAD AND BOUGHT THESE. I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE BRAND AND KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOOD QUALITY SHOES. I GET COMPLIMENTS FOR HAVING THEM SINCE THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT LOOKING. I DO LOVE THEM, I JUST WISH I HAD GOTTEN A BETTER DEAL"
3,Somewhat out of date.,It is an interesting and useful book; however it really needs to be updated to be relevant for 2010.
3,"Overall not a bad book, but not close to being good","Many of the explanations used in the book were well written but a bit hard to understand. Equations jump out of nowhere without any elaboration and the problems asked at the end come with no supplement or explanation in the chapter to help you out. I mostly had to look up the subjects on wikipedia to really get a better understanding of much of the material. Although I acknowledge this to be a book for an upper division class, so I'm not too disappointed overall with it, seeing as how I've already taken the introductory course to material sciences and it was my fault for really forgetting the minor details needed to fully comprehend the subject."
5,if you like yer head raped this is for you,this is excellent music to put on if yer havin yer own party and u feel like going nuts. dont put it on too much or youll blow up yer head or house. this stuff is insane except if u listen to it on yer own time then you need some help its for mad parties and not for chillin unless you like killing ppl
3,Older Napalm Death is much better,"This one does not have as much death metal as the older ones do.In fact only a couple songs do. Some of the songs are good but their earlier, more death sounding albums beat the hell out of this one. It isn't bad but it's not awesome. If you want really good ND then try either Harmony Corruption or Utopia Banished but death metallers, stick to the classics. Take my word for it."
3,"Good, but not as good as Scum","I have to say that Napalm Death has always released good albums despite their constant lineup change. However, they're a completely different band than they used to be. A lot of people don't know that they used to be a grindcore band. This album, along with a lot of others, is more commercial and straight-forward (not that that's a bad thing). If you really want to see this band at their best, I'd reccomend listening to ""Scum"" and ""From enslavement to obliteration."" However, if you like this particular style of metal, I would say that this album is one of the best."
3,For completists only,"This is one of those rare albums where the good stuff is at the end. ""Inside the Torn Apart"" begins with ""Breed to Breathe,"" which has riffs so melodic it's hard to believe that this is the same band that invented grindcore. ""Down in the Zero"" has some nifty syncopated drumming, but things don't really heat up until ""Prelude,"" which has the first blastbeats of the album. ""Lowpoint"" is absolutely crushing, while ""The Lifeless Alarm"" closes the album on an abstract, doomy note. The main drawback here is the overly clean production and the unnaturally clicky drums. The performances are efficiently precise, but there's little grit and no sense of danger here."
1,"Expensive, Should have been Included","When you buy a phone at this price, it should come with this accessory at no additional cost. Charging $9.99 is an insult. Went to Office Depot and I was able to find an HP iPAQ Stereo Earphone that includes the headphone and the adapter for the same price. The HP kit is made by www.Belkin.com (Part#F8U0106-HP). The adapter looks identical to this one."
2,Palm Treo Headphone Adapter,"It's a good product, but it's very big and with a bad move, it can broke the phone. Use it very carefully. I recomend to use a bluetooth stereo headset to avoid damage your Treo."
3,What a waste for a necessity,"This was written long after the purchase.It is required, overpriced, and a bit bulky but ya gotta have it."
1,Not real impressed,It only holds a charge for 5 minutes which is about enough time to clean up two spots or so. It is good to keep on hand for a quick clean up of a small spill but that is about it.
1,not worth it,"i got this item about two years ago. i have a dog that isn't quite house trained. a couple of months into it, the machine started to leak. it is hard to clean after using it also. i should have spend more money for a better machine."
4,Nearly perfect,"This book's strengths far outweight its weaknesses. True, the flow is somewhat disjointed, Throwing Muses and its members get too much coverage, and the copy editing is somewhat sloppy. Nonetheless, the depth of Pixies coverage is amazing. I've been listening to them since Surfer Rosa came out, but they've always been an inscrutable band lyrically, musically, and in interviews. Frank's collection opens the curtain, and gives us a peek into the life and history of a band.I enjoyed this book immensely."
5,As a Pixies fan I loved this book,"I have been a Pixies fan my whole life. This band has meant so much to me and my wife accidentally stumbled onto this book. So I started reading it and I had problems putting it done. This is an oral account of the Pixies, it's all about people's feelings and emotions being told by those that were close to the pixies and that's after all what really matters when you're talking about a bands history. Nobody cares about what exact date they started (like someone in a previous review mentioned). It's the story that matters. I don't think anybody will be able to produce a more in depth look into the Pixies then this book provided."
2,No Nona on here,"Instead of a new Nona Hendryx album , we get a cast album of songs she wrote for this BLUE musical. It's okay, but I'd have much preferred a whole new album of her rock/funk/dance/gospel/new wave/new age blend than the generic showbiz soul sung here by the cast of Blue. The expansion into cast music isn't as remarkable as the music she wrote and sang herself in the 70's and 80's. Makes me feel blue over no new music from her since 1989."
4,Contemporary Latin American Poetry Anthology,"It is a good book to have a taste on what's going on LatinAmerian poetry in the last three decades. I think the selection is Ok and any reader interested on Spanish language poetry can find a good selection by countries and poems quality. However, I expected something more real XXI Century. The First edition came just in the ninentiess of past century. Altough many of the selected authors are still alive and they permeate with their legacy this new century first years. Many of the poets are still active, so indeed is more like the transition into our days and continuation of the whole process."
4,As told from the torpedo room,Most of the memoirs of WWII submariners were written by vessel command personnel. I was excited to compare their testimonies with Russell's whose perspective was forged as an enlisted man assigned below deck.
1,NO Book,Ordered book 12/9. Now 1/20 and no book. Contacted dealer twice with no response. Had to turn in complaint to Amazon. Don't use this dealer.
5,Best Cross Cultural Communication book I've read,"This book describes the effect of culture on sensing, perception, selection, organization, and interpretation. I also learned that cross cultural communication as a field has a lot of statistical information that allowed one to see the ratings the countries had on various characteristics. The information that I found in the book was arranged in such a way that I could read a page or two each day and still learn something new or interesting. I also liked the information I found near the end of the book on the four types of marriages: traditional, independent, separate, and mixed.Overall, this book is a good read! I highly recommend it."
1,Poorly Written Book,I am using this book to teach a college level course on Intercultural Communication. I can in no way recommmend it as it is poorly written and poorly organized with the inclusion of irrelevant material and stereotypical characterizations of other cultures.
3,It might have been a five!,"""Of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: It might have been."" I'm 85 and cannot read fine print without either immediate eye-strain or a magnifying glass. This book alternates large, beautiful reproductions of parts of stained glass windows with sayings that range from corny to profound. The sayings, their attributions and the identification of the stained glass exhibited on the opposing page are in various font sizes. The saying is typically in a huge font; its attribution in a decent-sized font; and the identification of the stained glass (which some of us would really like to know about) is in a font which is much below my comfort level (which goes down to 10 pt. and that's it). If the identifications had been in a 10 pt. (or 12 pt.font would be even better) I would have given this product five stars..."
2,Not what it seems,"The stained glass images are great, but the cheesy ""You can do it, Christian Soldier!"" quotes on every other page are a real drag. These images speak for themselves, and the ill-conceived joining of them with motivational quotes, a tasteless re-packaging, steal the majesty of the stained glass itself. Also, a number of the pieces the authors chose to display are modern stained glass pieces, and I don't give a damn about modern stained glass."
1,wasted my money,"Directions on the video are incomplete & I wasted my money. This video sucks!!! NO, I will never recommend this product to anyone. I will tell anyone who asks how rotten this video is. I wish I could get my money back on this item too."
4,Great underrated film,"It's got a loose plot, some slightly implausible story lines, and no real path, but Feast Of Love is one of those films you see and think about a long time after. The acting ranges from great to excellent, and the interwoven tales jump from bittersweet to funny to near-tragic with astonishing ease, a rare accomplishment from a director. Definitely wirth seeing, but once you do, you'll likely want to own it."
3,Realistic Love Story,"Feast of LoveNot much different in love stories told time and again. Veteran actors Morgan Freeman & Jane Alexander lead a good cast of actors in this tour of realistic love today. Warning for the kids, full frontal & partial female nudity, hence the rating. But it was an engaging story of falling in love. The story is told through the eyes of Morgan's character with insight and modesty. Notice that two of the younger actresses have both played in movies with Vin Diesel. Rhada Mitchel in ""Pitch Black"" and Alexa Davalos in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" as the now grown up ""Jack/Keira"". I thought the plot was good and well written and very realistic by today's standards. This movie will make you sad, glad and mad. And if you don't shed a tear then you just aren't trying. Try it you may like it I do."
2,Not as good as it could have been,So what happened to Selma Blair's character? It is her search for self-discovery that spins Greg Kinnear's into all that follows for the rest of the film. Every role gets a development and conclusion -- except the lesbian? A filmmaker who starts something he can't handle shouldn't bother looking through the lens to begin with.
2,Don't judge this movie by it's cover,This movie isn't bad...but it is not what the DVD cover makes it out to be. It is not a comedy. It is a drama with one or two funny lines.
1,worst movie I have ever seen,"I went to see this in the theater and walked out. It was bad enough I wasted my money on a ticket I wasnt going to compound it by wasting another hour of my life. It was NOT romantic, definitely not funny and had nothing to do with love. The characters were either boring or totally unlikable."
1,Massive Disappointment; Giant Waste of Talent,This movie costumes itself as a romance but is a closet tragedy. Basic premise is that each human being no matter how blindly unaware or callous or vicious or unfeeling or lacking in principals or morality is basically nice and therefore all behavior is excused.Do not waste your money or your time.
4,Great Movie,"We bought the movie primarily because it was filmed in Portland, and the house that was purchased by the young couple was the house I grew up in. It was especially nice seeing the neighborhoods again, and especially the house. Morgan Freeman was great as ususal, I always enjoy his movies, and the theme of the movie was also great. I'm sorry it didn't make a bigger splash in theatre's. As far as the purchase goes, the original shipment was an empty box, but customer service corrected it in two days. Thanks"
5,Best movie I never heard of,"I had never heard of this movie till I watched it from netflix and loved it so much I had to have it,Its a Great story for those of us who think we should just give up on love it tells us just when you think you will never find the love your looking for you find it, I believe,"
3,abstract hiphop?,"The growing world of abstract hiphop is producing some great material, but to qualify as hip hop, it must be hiphop, and that means it has to be real. Dj Cam's ""Substances"" seems to forget that at times, verging more towards ambient and triphop. While the fusion of arabic music,hiphop instrumentals and jazz produces some fresh results (check out ""lost kingdom"")underground hiphop headz might find the whole album too detached from the raw beats and street philosophy they're used to."
5,"If you want the best in electric Hot Tuna, here it is!","Many times in the past a few of my friends were on their way to a ""tuna"" concert and I always had something to do and couldn't make it; well, I'm not missing them at the Colonial Theater on Friday Nov.30th 2001 in Keene, New Hampshire. I'm partial to the electric sound that Jorma and Jack put through so that is why ""Yellow Fever"" is an obvious ""americas'choice"" for anyone who truly knows the band or for those who've maybe never heard them before and can take a chance on the advice of an awesome review!"
4,America's Choice; round 2...,"Yellow Fever picks right up where ""America's Choice"" left off. The only reason I gave this a ""4"" is because I happen to prefer ""AC"" just a little bit more. A great, great album!"
5,excellent resource for life-like flowers!,"I have many books on polymer clay and this is one of my favorites! The techiques show here can be applied to any sculpture but what impressed me was how lifelike these projects look! And with such detailed explanations and illustrations it is an easy jump to use these techiques to create flowers of your own choice. I have made figures from polymer clay for 7 years now and most books are repetitive to me, I found this one re-energized my creative juices and gave me something new to make, I now make minature flowers to adorn some of my figures and have been pleased with the new dimension it adds."
5,Love IT!!!!,"So Awesome! The book is in like new condition... could not be happier!!! :) Arrived before scheduled, book is great & I am a happy customer!!I am impressed with this book & all I will learn for my new crafting!Thanks!"
4,Bumparena - great game for all ages,"Most of the reviews here are for other Cranium games - not Bumparena specifically. While all of the Cranium games are great, Bumparena is a fun one because it is EASY to learn and play, does not require reading, and can be enjoyed by my 6 year old and my almost 9 year old. The adults like it too. My only complaint is that once it's out of the box, it does NOT fit back in very well... so much so that it almost makes me not want to get it out. That being said, it is fun, worth the money, and good for a wide variety of ages and skill levels."
3,"Great Game, but Horrible design!","My kids and even my 3 year old nephew love to play this game & so do I.However, it's a pain to set up & almost impossible to fit back in the box. You have to totally take it apart to put it away.I always look for toys that have a place to store the toy or I use a plastic tote. This one has neither!This game is too large & awkward to leave out, but I HATE trying to take it all apart & get it back in the box.I would otherwise give this game 5 stars."
5,Bumperena Review,"An nice game that doesn't require too much thought/focus. Draw cards from a deck which allow you to add or move bumpers from the board or move balls between gates at the top. Release the balls and be the first one to get six into your pocket at the bottom and you win. Another reviewer calls this ""Avalanche with strategy"" and that's a good summary. Yes, the balls sometimes get stuck on a bumper (we just don't count them). My kids still like the game and it's quite different from most 'board' games."
2,not so much fun!!,"We love the Cranium games at our home...we have several, however, this one fell short as far as we are concerned. The kids simply found it boring and enjoyed throwing the bouncing balls rather than playing the game. We'll stick too some of the other cranium games."
5,Really fun,"I brought this for my 13 year old. When she first saw it, she was upset because she didn't know what it was and thought it would be boring. But when she opened it and figured it out she was really excited. I played her and her sister. It's fun. I like this game because you really don't know who will win, you really have to figure out a strategy to get the balls to come to your side. I also like it because it's not long and drawn out like ""life"" game. I like games that are quick sometimes."
2,Disappointed in Cranium,"We are a big game family and have all of the Cranium games. I love the new ideas they have and am constantly impressed by their uniting of intelligence and fun, however, bumparena is not their best work. Now, my daughter might be a little on the old side for this game (9), but she still loves Hullabulo and Cariboo, which are aimed at the younger kids. Bumperena is just not fun over and over. It also is a pain to set up and doesn't fit back in the box. The idea is cool, and the pieces are cool looking, but the game is not exciting and it sits on our shelf collecting dust. You would do better to invest in Cadoo, the Family Fun Cranium or Balloon Lagoon. These days, my daughter is really into Conga, but if your kids are under 7, I wouldn't recommend it, there is a lot of writing with out assistance. Bumperena is overrated."
2,Bumpers,"Product stated it was complete; however,was not. Missing 4 out of 5 legs that make it stand up. Therefore, need to improvise."
2,Reads like an 8th graders report,"This book fails to provide any details that are worth while.Each food resource consists of a list of tribes that used that genus (species not differentiated). No details provided on method of harvesting nor required processing.Another major section provids drawing of traditional clothing such as mocasins. Many different styles of mocasins are prepresented, but no discussion is made about the pros and cons of various designs. While interesting from a historical aspect, this is not a reference for survival skills. The details of any skills are iced over in favor of descriptioin of that was."
3,Display Cases,"Nice cases but a bit misleading because I thought the base had a diamond type look to it when in actuality, you need to cut out cardboard pictures of it on the box and place them on the bases."
1,Do not buy this if you need to generate blueprints.,"This is a graphics based program, similar to illustrator, this is not for mechanical drawing of houses, or ""drafting""!I also bought the symbol library, save your money!"
2,not worthy the trouble of replacing the battery in the Norelco,I first tried to replace the NiCd battery with the new Metalhyride battery since they have a much larger current storage capacity. It turns out that the MH batteries tend to leak current so their voltage will drop steadily even without use. I then decided to replace the original NiCd battery with this one from Amazon.com (supposed to be exactly like the original one in my Norelco shaver). The battery turns out to last at most 14 shaves (ie two week) rather than the over 20 shaves I used to get from the original battery. After several charges I am getting only 10 shaves per charge. If this number drops further I would throw away the shaver. If I had known earlier that the replacement batteries are so much inferior to the original ones I would have bought a new shaver.
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this product at the beginning of February intending to us it for a Valentines Day gift for my parents. As of today, March 3rd, I still have yet to receive it! I'm extremely disappointed! I've tried numerous times to contact the company via email but have yet to have any sort of response from them. You can bet that this has already been charged to my card yet I have nothing to show for the charge. I would appreciate some sort of customer service here! This sure does make me think negatively about ordering items thru this company and thru Amazon again. Egad! By the way, I wouldn't give this review any stars but this format wouldn't allow for that."
3,Kind of like coffee,"I like Pero. This not coffee, nor will there be anything like coffee, without the caffeine. Compared to coffee, Pero has a more bland taste. Not that it doesn't have flavor, it does. Just not like coffee. But the more I drink, the more I enjoy. It has its own unique flavor. Much better than Teccinno (Yuk!). There are no side effects and no caffeine. Since I gave up caffeine, my energy has returned and I require less sleep, amazingly. And, at age 41, it is an unexpected blessing. Thanks Pero!"
4,Delicious,"I tried this since Postum is no longer available. It's not Postum, but as chicory based drinks go I think its a delicious coffee alternative."
3,Not as good as Postum,"This will be a substitute for my favorite drink, Postum, but it doen't have the mellow taste."
2,It's not Postum!,"Please bring back Postum. This stuff is supposed to be similar--it's OK, I guess but it just ain't the same thing. Won't somebody please bring back Postum?"
2,weak,"Since Postum has been discontinued, I've been looking for a substitute and came across recommendations for Pero. Unfortunately I found it to be bland. My search continues..."
1,Interesting but highly inaccurate,"Charles Fleming clearly knows very little about Cuba,its culture, Havana landmarks or Cuba's recent history. For those who know Cuba well, his inaccuracies are irritants and distractions from what could otherwise be an interesting thriller. Do your research, Mr. Fleming, or set your story in Kiribati or such, in which case you would only risk offending a handful of people."
2,double thick collar,The collar was super sturdy but that was it's downfall. The collar would not flex at all so it made our dog's throat irritated. He began to develop a cough-like hack. Our dog is 70 lbs so he is a big dog but the collar was not appropriate. When we switched to a single thickness collar his cough disapated.
2,easy to read but flawed,"I found this a page turner, but I was really turned off by the ""hero"" smoking dope and giving it to his girlfriend, with whom he goes to bed practically as soon as he gets a chance. Other than some of the moral aspects of the protagonist's character, this boook moves right along, even tho its plot is simplistic. I may read its sequel"
3,The Lasko Tangent review,"Was an ok book. It sounds like it was written in the first person though, like the author was the character"
3,Good Story - Poor Editing,"The story line was good. I say that with some reservation. The mistake Paget makes near the end of the book that almost blows his case is not believable. I read a large print library book, and I don't know if it was a beta copy or what, but I couldn't believe the numerous writing errors. The punctuation was terrible. There were many misplaced commas and quotation marks, even some misspelling. It was like something you'd expect from a first draft by an elementary school student. It didn't totally spoil my reading, but it was very distracting. I hope his later books are better proofed."
4,RNP gets better with age,"Having read and loved most RNP books, I was surprised that I wasn't sucked in from the get go with this one. Still a good read though and recommended for RNP fans."
3,Something missing.,"I like Patterson's work. However, I didn't care for this one. I found the story often confusing. Not very detailed, leaving me feeling as if there was missing pieces to the plot. Not his best!"
3,CRISP BUT NOT TOTALLY SATISFYING,"This is Patterson's first book, and in his introduction he offers an explanation for its inception. Christopher Paget appears in two later novels, ""Degree of Guilt"" and ""Eyes of a Child"" which are far superior novels than this one. Be warned, though---if you read ""Degree of Guilt"" first you'll pretty much know what happens in this book. Paget is a little overbearing and cynical in this one and not as likeable in his mature years. The pace is pretty effective, and the villains are appropriately nasty. I found the ending a tad bit too brisk; it just seemed to end.RECOMMENDED IN ORDER TO ENJOY THE BETTER SEQUELS."
4,A light thriller for the beach!,"In The Lasko Tangent, prosecutor Christopher Paget of the Economic Crimes Commission is given the assignment of investigating possible stock manipulation of a company owned by the powerful and politically connected William Lasko. Paget begins to suspect Lasko of a darker side, but the political connections, reaching to the president, make this an awkward task. Paget isn't entirely likable, but he is certainly competent. And the bad guys are bad.This is a light read for the summer beach, a waiting room, or an airline seat. Author Richard North Patterson writes well."
5,Great read!,I just had to keep reading to see what happened next. Don't confuse this author with the other Patterson. Both are good but Richard North Patterson has depth to his stories that is fascinating.
4,Lasko Tangent,I recently discovered this author. I am looking forward to reading his books. I really enjoyed this selection and can't wait to read more.
5,couldnt agree more,"yeah, i agree with errthing that was said in the other reviews. this is a classic album that really got slept on. i got lucky and found like 2 copies of this disc at a used cd store and after i heard the album, i went back & snagged the other copy i didnt get da first time. you feel me? the guest appearances are excellent, the beats are some of the dopest ever, and lyrics from DD, flowed very nicely. check this album out, anyway you can. definitely for all west coast headz."
5,SUGAFREE THE ORIGINAL POMONA PIMP!,"My man Dazzie Dee,has probably made a west coast classic with this album.Forget Dr Dre,Snoop,Warren G etc,this album is far far better than anythung they have ever done.With my n****r Battlecat on production duties,you know you're going to get one hell of a good album.And one hell of a good album it certainly is!Pure G-Funk from start to finish.Peace,Love and Unity my cuz',you done did good homie!"
5,Imagining and creating the garden of one's dreams,"The Intuitive Gardener: Finding Creative Freedom In The Garden by gardening expert Marilyn Raff is an impressively ""user friendly"" guide to imagining and creating the garden of one's dreams. Raff accessibly teaches the reader how to follow intuition rather than be captive to overused and stale rules. Individual chapters cover creative raising of roses, grasses, plants for shady sites, and a great more. Vibrant color photographs add a visual appeal to the extensive text. The Intuitive Gardener is a welcome and invaluable addition to any personal reading list or professional gardening reference collection."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the pictured item, but instead received a totally different product that wasn't at all what I needed. It actually was a set of items that had everything needed to bleach your hair except the pictured item. Really bummed :/"
3,An overly wordy reference with lots of hidden gems,"I've read nearly a dozen security related books now, including a lot from the Hacking Exposed team. This doesn't compare. There's no flare, there's no personality, it's a reference text.It reads like a text book, infact, 90% of what's in it is probably in the standard MS texts, manuals and online. So while it's great they've brought all this info together in one place, they might have been better to wrap explination around references, rather than repeating information verbose.There are lots of gems hidden away, like a detailed description of how kerberos and the token issueing processes work. But sometimes it really falls short, like when listing security related event IDs, it only lists the ""more common"" ones and there's no reference to locate the rest.I read this cover to cover, which I think was a mistake, it's probably better as a reference, where if you've got a task to perform, you skim the relevant sections.Your milage may vary."
1,17 Days late and still no book,I ordered my book on 8/5 and it's 8/22 today. Still no book and I am close to 10 chapters behind in my accelerated learning class. How convenient that they deleted my first review to make sure they don't look bad to the public. I ordered my book on the 5th and never got the book as of today. This company has made 0 attempt to make up for my inconvenience. Thanks for nothing.
